2566891,5,B000FIGXGM,Many reviewers have mentioned that the stars of this production sing their hearts out and I totally agree. I have never worried too much about productions and whether the producers are coherent in their ideas regarding the staging (One example is the Netrebko/Villazon Salzburg Traviata). This Donizetti opera is fantastic from start to finish and well worth buying and watching over again.,1168300800,3,390,5.306451612903226
2566892,4,B000FIGXGM,"This is what opera on DVD should be: A beautifully sung and lovingly directed production, splendidly packaged (with a bonus DVD yet)...and at a very affordable price.

I too have reservations about Emilio Sagi's updating, only in that it makes no sense whatsoever  in regards to the actual libretto.  (Admittedly not an insignificant problem.) If Marie has been raised by the American army, why on Earth is she saluting the French when the regiment comes to her rescue in Act 2?  And at what time during WWII were the Americans and French ""enemies?""  Pure nonsense.  But when one can revel in the sublime voices of Juan Diego Florez and Patrizia Ciofi (who I found to be surprisingly comfortable with the comedy), why quibble?  Everyone on stage, in the audience and in the pit is having a marvelous time, and I defy anyone watching at home not to have one as well.",1162339200,8,865,4.688741721854305
2566893,5,B000FIGXGM,"La Fille du Regiment has too many ""rata-tat-tat"" marching choruses for it to be my favorite Donizetti comedy, but it has some magnificent bel canto pieces (like ""Il faut partir"") and some great comic moments (like the music lesson in Act II that requires the soprano playing Marie to purposefully sing off-key). This production succeeds on all levels.

The director cleverly sets the action in a French village in the final days of World War II, after the Germans have withdrawn. Marie is the daughter of an American army captain who has died, resulting in her being ""adopted"" by the entire regiment. Tonio is a young French villager whose love for Marie leads him to join the American ranks. The updated setting works well. The relationships among the characters feel even more authentic than in the opera's original Tyrolean setting, and the Act I and Act II sets invoke the historical period well - Act I taking place in a bar in the French village and Act II in the chateau of the Marquise who is determined to turn tomboy Marie into a refined woman.

Usually the soprano playing Marie (the fille du regiment) is the star of the show, but in this production, Patrizia Ciofi must share those honors with Juan Diego Florez who plays Tonio. Florez must be the best lyric tenor around today. His ""Ah! mes amis"" is worth the price of the DVD alone. He hits each of its famous nine high-C's with such precision, ease, and punch that I almost came out of my seat nine times! And then nine turns to 18 as he encores the piece. (And if 18 isn't enough for you, Florez performs excerpts from ""Ah! mes amis"" on the bonus DVD, treating us to his own commentary on each note prior to our seeing him sing it.)

Patrizia Ciofi has a beautiful lyric soprano voice that is incredibly strong given her slight build. She sings with precise attention to phrasing and just floats those high notes. Her voice blends well with Florez's, making their duets a delight. My only difficulty with Ciofi is that she lacks a certain ease onstage (this is true in the other performances I've seen her in: La Traviata and Lucie de Lammermoor). There may be nothing she can do about it, but I'm always aware of how hard she's working at singing (I can see it in her facial contortions). In a comic opera, this effort sometimes detracts from the comedy. Beverly Sills famously called the role of Marie, ""Lucille Ball with high notes."" There's no Lucille Ball in Ciofi's performance simply because she isn't relaxed enough to project that kind of screwball comedy. That said, Ciofi demonstrates that this opera need not rely on slapstick; using her dramatic abilities, Ciofi gets us to focus less on the comedy and more on Marie's relationship to the other characters: to her surrogate father (Sulpice), to her newfound ""aunt"" (the Marquise), and, of course, to her lover, Tonio. Ciofi offers stunning renditions of Marie's slow, poignant arias and is justly rewarded by the audience for her expressive, nuanced singing. Francesca Franci does a fine job as the Marquise, making her into a flesh and blood character. Nicola Ulivieri, with his full-bodied bass voice, sings and acts the part of Sulpice convincingly.

And then, as icing on the cake, there's that bonus DVD with several special features. One of them, ""Backstage with La Fille"" is brilliant. In it, the director takes 14 scenes from the opera and shows each one in rehearsal and then cuts to the scene in performance. It's instructive and fun. For example, we see Ciofi and Florez, in street clothes, rehearsing one of their Act I duets when the conductor suddenly stops the music and says something like, ""Wait, wait. The orchestra is playing at one tempo, Patrizia is singing at another, and Juan Diego at yet another. Can we all please perform at the same speed?"" Then the scene cuts to the performance where, of course, the orchestra and the two players perform the piece to perfection. There's another great rehearsal moment when, first Florez, and then Ciofi each sing their final note terribly off key; the two of them turn and give each other a priceless look, like they've just smelled rotten eggs.

This is a DVD (two DVD's actually) to treasure.",1161734400,28,4187,4.73013698630137
2566894,4,B000FIGXGM,"This production is distinguished not only by the wonderful singing of Juan Diego Florez and Patrizia Ciofi but by the excellent conducting of Riccardo Frizza. Not content to accompany his star singers in slavish, bandmaster-like fashion, Frizza instead imposes a welcome authority in the pit that causes even these splendid singers to outdo themselves in excellence. Frizza's command is evident from the opening bars; the overture, vigorously conducted, announces to all ears that here at least Donizetti wasn't writing music for the neighborhood ice cream truck.

There are problems with this staging, though. They are the usual ones in ""new"" productions these days and are precisely targeted in the review just below.  For whatever reasons, European stage, costume and set designers seem pretty much all to have minds violated by a single, repetitive, and sadly misguided idea. It is that a work of an earlier time and code of manners can be made relevant to a presumably self-centered current audience only by some sort of arbitrary, often frankly stupid updating.  This view not only insults the imaginative forces of said audience, but shows massive disrespect for what the composer and his librettist have wrought. Eric Bentley, the great theater critic, saw through this practice years ago in reference to Shakespearean productions. In his essay ""Maiming the Bard"" Bentley argued that by setting a work of one era, language and manners in the sets and costumes of another, one didn't achieve universality. Rather one created an irrelevance, a work taking place not everywhere, but instead nowhere. That ""Fille"" set among Americans in France, far from being ""universal,"" doesn't even fit the standards of common sense is a consequence for which stage director Emilio Sagi and/or costume and set designer Julio Galan should be held accountable.",1161388800,6,1849,5.282312925170068
2566895,4,B000FIGXGM,"Musically, this is an excellent presentation, with beautiful and characterful singing by soprano Patrizia Ciofi as Marie and tenor Juan Diego Florez as Tonio. Florez is spectacular in the famous aria ""O mes amis"" with its nine top C's. The chorus and the supporting singers are excellent. So why only four stars?

  The opera was originally set in Tyrol, during Napoleon's invasion. This production is updated and relocated to France in about 1945. Aside from the fact that the costumes and scenery are much less attractive in this setting (U. S. army uniforms were designed for utility, not style, and twentieth century nobles dressed far less elaborately than those of the Napoleonic era), the change of time and locale makes nonsense of much of the plot. It was perfectly reasonable for nineteenth century Tyroleans to fear Napoleon's soldiers, but why would French people of 1945 fear American soldiers and refer to them as ""the enemy""? And how did an American regiment adopt a French orphan in the 1920's and take her with them when invading the continent twenty or so years later?

  Libretto alterations intended to adapt the words to the changed circumstances cannot make sense of these things. Moving the setting forward by nearly one and one-half centuries still leaves it about sixty years in the past. Can such a change really make the drama more meaningful to today's audiences?

  I believe that audiences respond to music drama according to the feelings of the characters and their responses to the situations in which they find themselves, not according to the clothes they wear or the technology they employ. Filmmakers have presented drama successfully in settings ranging from prehistoric to futuristic without any fear that the audience would be unable to identify with their characters. Why do opera producers and directors feel a need to tamper? Presenting a work as its creators intended need not limit the creativity of its producers. It is possible to illuminate a work without altering it.

  Well, anyway... I think you'll enjoy this performance for what it is, even if you can't help thinking about what it might have been.",1161216000,13,2151,5.028169014084507
2566896,5,B000FIGXGM,"Let me say it at once: This is a sensational opera DVD. One of the very best I have seen lately!!

The opera takes place around the year 1815, when the French occupied the Tyrol area. The Director Emilio Sagi transferred the action to a small village in France in the final days of World War II. This transformation seems very successful to me. The staged is designed in Act I and II as a large family-run bar. The sets are beautiful and rich in details. In Act III our heroine Marie's aunt, the Duchess tries to arrange Marie's marriage to La marquise de Berkenfield son. So in Act III we are in the Duchess home, which is designed elegantly, but is not overloaded.

The orchestra plays splendidly for the Italian conductor Riccardo Frizza. The two leading roles are Marie and her beloved Tonio. Marie is sung here by one of the best lyric Italian sopranos of today, Patrizia Ciofi. The voice is beautiful and with amazing floating high notes. She is very slim so it amazes me from where all this volume of sound is coming... but it is not only about the perfect voice production. Her singing is refined, full of nuance and emotion. She is an outstanding actress too. The audience responds with prolonged and loud applauses after her three arias, and even in the middle of a musical piece, sometimes the audience cannot wait and those amazing high notes are followed with loud applauses.

On her side, a superstar tenor: the Peruvian Juan Diego Flrez. What an amazing singer. He delivers his first great and very famous aria Ah! mes amis brilliantly. This aria is notorious in that it includes nine high Cs!. The audience goes crazy after the aria, so as encore, Flrez sings it once more!! The delicate third Act aria is done in an exquisite and very moving way. The audience goes crazier...

Other members of the cast are very good. I liked especially the Duchess of Francesca Franci. This is not an especially pleasant mezzo voice, but she uses it effectively and creates a real figure. As this is an Italian production, French diction of some of the singers is not perfect (mainly Nicola Ulivieri as Suplice), but Ciofi and Flrez sing and speak very good French.

Technical quality - picture and sound is first rate. I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough. It presents singing of rare quality, at least on DVD...",1160524800,40,2319,4.632603406326034
2566897,3,B000FIGXGM,"As a 'comedy' presentation, this DVD is not funny - its slapstick! Juan Diego Flrez and Patrizia Ciofi don't command the stage with their physical presence and movement although they sing their hearts out. I would have been better served without the dismal staging and at the next hearing, will look to take in the glorious singing without the visuals. There are too many interruptions with a raucous audience. Without proper choreography, the American soldiers clutter the stage and no purpose is served by having so many on so small a stage (and, what purpose is served by changing the 1815 French into 1945 Americans?). The sound is good and one feels the presence of the surround.",1191801600,6,684,4.854700854700854
2566898,5,B000FIGXGM,"Ciofi seems so serious, nervous and not naturalduring the whole opera. Florez didn't seem to enjoye on stage as in other productions. Singing is wonderful, specially FLOREZ, but I missed the fun of Sutherland in the Sydney production of August 1986. She was not at her best but I really enjoyed her singing and acting. I would like to have seen her and Florez. The 5 stars are only for the singing because the rest does not deserve that high rate, specially the sets and costumes.",1186099200,5,480,4.593023255813954
2566899,3,B000FIGXGM,"Don't get me wrong,this production deserves 5+++ stars for singing by Patrizia Ciofi and Juan Diego Florez. But does anybody on the stage or in the audience remembered that it supposed to be a comedy? Did you hear anybody in the theater laughing? Not at all. People went wild for Juan's 9 high Cs or Patrizia's ""Il faut partir!"", both were superb! But that does not make it La Fille...

First culprit is staging. Transposing operas to different times sometimes works, most often it doesn't. This is a very plausable transfer to World War Two, but I don't see the point. Nothing gained, no any new insights, other way around:comic aspect is lost. It gets too real, too serious. And at the same time - why would a girl, at this time and being were she is, listen to her aunt?

Second problem is casting of Patrizia Ciofi. I like her singing very much and have every DVD available with her singing. But she is not a comic actress, not even the comic singer. Her ""Chacun le sait,chacun le dit"" does not sparkle with humor and fun. She is the tragic actress, as her Lucia or Giulietta (in Bellini's Capuleti e Montecchi) so brilliantly show. She is an outstanding singer, but it is hard to watch her facial expressions, when she sings. In this performance she tries hard, but it still comes more tragic, than comic. Her Marie is not charming, but simply raff.

Juan Diego Florez is much more in his element. He is great comic actor as well as singer and there are plenty of other performances were he shines. This is not one of them. His singing though is very exciting and to have an encore in the middle of an opera, is a treat and one more confirmation, what this performance is all about.

The rest of the cast is OK. The chorus is barely making it. The same problem, no sparkle, no fun and not much of Bel Canto singing either.

Overall: Get it if you want to hear Juan Diego Florez sailing brilliantly through nine Cs - But get another Fille for Donizetti's comedy.",1179446400,8,1966,4.45
2566900,4,B000FIGXGM,"LA FILLE DU REGIMENT, with its lighthearted music and vocal fireworks, is a favorite that has spurts of being staged due more to a dearth of singers who can perform the roles than anything else. In the 1960's and 70's, Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pavarotti wowed audiences the world over and recorded what is considered by many to be the definitive recording of the work. Today, the popular and gifted light tenor Juan Diego Florez has made the role of Tonio his own, and this DVD has captured Florez' vocal abilities and stage presence well. Likewise Patrizia Ciofi is a compelling Marie. Neither Florez nor Ciofi match the Sutherland/Pavarotti pairing, but both are more vocally suited for the roles. Ideally the role of Tonio should be performed by a tenor with a lighter voice than Pavarotti's (even though he's great in the role and his fuller voice, especially at the time he recorded it, is phenomenal), and casting Florez is nearly perfect, reminding listeners of Alfredo Kraus). Ciofi is likewise at home in her performance, at least vocally.

If this were a recording, it would probably be a five star disc. However, it's a DVD, so the visual has to be taken into account too. For some reason, Teatro Carlo Fenice decided to update the story from late 18th/early 19th century France to World War II with the Americans and French at war with each other, not exactly historically accurate. The problem I had with the updating is that it doesn't match the story itself. An orphan girl being adopted by an army regiment that views the girl as a daughter and never in a sexual way, is not the most believable story, unless it happens at a time when we can naively imagine such a story. The Marquise ""adopting"" Marie and trying to refine her also seems more plausible in an earlier day. Instead, the updating seems out of place and antics seemed silly in an updated staging whereas setting it back to its original setting makes it a bit more believable. Though the staging at times could be distracting, but never so distracting that it took away from the wonderful performances. Keep in mind too, the cameras would have picked up facial expression that would have been missed by the audience at Fenice, so the distractions of the DVD were probably not all that much of a problem for the live audience.

The audience must have overlooked the staging problems. Everything from a musical perspective was enthusiastically received. Florez did an encore of Tonio's nine High c's in ""A Mes Ami"" and hit all the notes in both performances. Musically it was a great night of theater and it's certain to be a DVD that will be popular for years to come.",1178496000,11,2648,4.704741379310345
2566901,4,B000FIGXGM,"While this performance is great and probably the best available, with Florez singing Ah mes amis twice, his performance in London with Dessay was better, due to her superb singing and better staging. It is a crying shame that Decca cannot or will not bring out the very best of his performances since they need to be preserved for posterity. Decca controls what comes out since he has an exclusive contract with them and they are the doorkeeper to his recordings. I believe that almost all live performances are taped and all Decca would have to do is to use the London performance tape and issue a version with Dessay. But whether Decca feels any obligation to art and to posterity is not certain.",1175990400,8,698,4.637096774193548
2566902,4,B000FIGXGM,"The opera is a minor work that gained popularity with Pavarotti at the Met. I admit that Pavarotti also gained popularity at the same time.

The change to World War II may have saved some money on costumes but I believe it was a very bad decision which made the opera look even ""more minor"".

Ciofi sang very well and she is not a bad looking lady. However, she made me nervous with the face expressions that she used. On the other hand, Florez has a very strong and far reaching voice but I did not like the color of its voice. It is way too nasal for me. He sounds like a strong ""tenorino"".

Other than that, it was a good production. I enjoyed again the pretty melodies and the 9 Cs which where ""encored"".",1174176000,4,708,4.1911764705882355
2566903,1,B000FIGXGM,"Sorry to be the nay sayer here gang. But, this puppy's going out with the next trash pick-up. First off, can we talk MISCASTING here of Patrizia Ciofi? Like, come on--MARIA is meant to be a fun loving teenie bopper in a comical setting. Ciofi takes the hard edge approach; almost like something out of ""Das Madchen in Uniform"".Super man tenor himself, Juan Diego Florez, try as he might, can't keep this fiasco afloat. Even his stunning vocalese fire works display seemed dampened by this whole Titanic like voyage. But most siful, on the musical side, we're treated to sloppy ensemble; just can't even think of doing it with BEL CANTO; Maestro Riccardo Frizza mostly at fault--but hey, there's blame enough to go all around. Lastly, the overall production concept--of updating this piece--just doesn't hold water. Heck, even the principals and chorus on

stage don't seem convinced of the notion; so then, how are we expected

to by into this ill conceived premise. Oh, PS. One five star reviewer was so smitten by a ""third act aria""--sorry, dude; but Mr. Donizetti only penned two acts to this opera.",1171929600,8,1102,4.8563829787234045
2566904,5,B000FIGXGM,"If you could ignore the modern setting that made non-sense to many parts of the libretto, this production really has nothing to flaw it.

Apart from the fact that Ms. Ciofi is not too comical and sweet in her facial expressions, vocally she almost scored perfect in this very taxing performance on a soprano. It is amazing to see how she could still sing with added zeal and prowess in the latter acts and scenes, despite the fact that she is a slight figure and without Sutherland's physical built. Her vocal technique is really stunning. This is of course shared by her partner Juan Diego Florez, though arguably Tonio's role is not as physically (though not technically) taxing as Marie's.

The two supporter singers are also very strong in their performances.",1170115200,7,763,4.816793893129771
2566905,5,B000FIGXGM,"The landmark recording is a now almost forty year old Deccca recording with Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pavarotti with both opera superstars in superb voice. The new set boasts two excellent principals, Patrizia Ciofi and Juan Diego Florez, who are both vocally opulent, have a  great stage presence and present very funny performances. Tranferring the action from the 19th century to World War Two is fatuous but the two principals, supporting cast and chorus in an excellently conducted performance make this a very enjoyable viewing anf listening performance. Diego-Florez compares very favourably with Pavarotti in the tenor show-piece, ""A mes amis"" and generously provides a full encore complete with its famous 9 High Cs.

This set it strongly recommended.

8122917,5,B000FIGXGM,An excellent production and fine singing and acting especially from Ciofi and Florez,1516406400,,84,5.538461538461538
8122918,5,B000FIGXGM,"I bought this recording as a result of a particularly glowing review in The Gramophone magazine that suggested that it was as close to definitive as we have any right to expect. At no point have I regretted the purchase, and even in the face of the slightly later Dessay version, I still would urge viewers to consider this as the better performance.

In this production the action is moved forwards to the WW2 period without any loss. The theatre is smaller and more intimate in feel than Covent Garden even though it provides some 2000 seats for the packed audience as here. The audience is enthusiastic in a very Italian manner and there is a strong sense of involvement with both the action on the stage and with being one of the audience in this recording.

There are four stand-out parts in this opera and in this production they are all particularly well sung and acted with a clear sense of enjoyment. The substantial supporting roles of Sulpice as chief `father' to Marie and La marquise as Marie's real mother are both performed to perfection by Nicola Ulivieri and Francesca Franci respectively. Both of these singers have what seems to be a natural talent for conveying a gentle humour and this is a great asset providing amusement without vulgarity.

The two star roles of Tonio, performed by Juan Diego Florez, and Marie, performed by Patrizia Ciofi, are especially rewarding. Both have voices that are ideal for their parts. Florez, with his somewhat `trumpety' vocal timbre cuts through orchestral and choral textures with apparent ease. His `Mes amis' aria is a show-stopper earning insistent demands for an encore which he supplies with brio. Ciofi's following `Il faut partir' rises to the challenge with a fabulously sensitive delivery of the contrasting gentle aria and this also stops the show. This high level of artistic delivery is maintained from the start to the very end of the opera. Florez and Ciofi also make for a believable couple so the romantic element is credible and the relationship between Sulpice and La marquise is allowed to develop as a sub-plot and is also acceptable here. The second act allows Ciofi full rein to demonstrate her wonderful sense of humour with singing of superlative style and execution. This is an invaluable example of tasteful and skilful musical wit rather than slapstick comedy.

The chorus is unusual in this opera as it is an early example of having some real dramatic value rather than just commenting upon the action rather in the style of a Greek tragedy. This different role for the chorus is discussed in the accompanying recorded bonus. In this case the male chorus especially is rather past its prime as an example of a fighting unit, but in view of the comedic nature of the opera, their `unfit for purpose' appearance seems quite appropriate. At least they are able to both sing and act well enough!
The important non-singing roles of la Duchesse de Crakentorp and the marquise's various servants and staff are delivered with humour that are positively amusing without exceeding the bounds of good taste.

The orchestra plays well and the whole production is conducted with zest by Ricardo Frizza.

There is an extra disc of bonus material, the longest of which is an engaging resum of the plot led by Ciofi, and to a lesser extent by Florez, with interesting illustrative cuts taken from rehearsal and performance sequences. There is also a short history and description of the theatre as a second bonus. Other bonuses include trailers and a photo gallery.
Decca have produced a recording of good sound presented in DTS surround and stereo formats. The camera work is involving with clear imaging. This is a very engaging recorded experience and seemingly faithful to the concept of the production, the performance and the audience response.

I personally have found this to be a favourite presentation of an opera that I enjoy immensely. It has given me enormous pleasure every time it has been played and I would expect it to give similar pleasure to other purchasers. The Gramophone gave good advice by suggesting that this was special and I fully agree with their assessment. Regardless of the competition, I would therefore suggest that this is fully deserving of a 5 star recommendation.",1345939200,2,4272,4.9004149377593365

The two leads, Patrizia Ciofi, as Marie and Juan Diego Florez, as Tonio, are simply outstanding in their roles.  Florez delivers his nine (9) high Cs in his first act aria ""Ah mes ames"" and its demanded encore wonderfully.  Such ease and accuracy--he's phenomenal.

Her head is continuously tilted sideways and her face becomes asymmetrically - this is frightening to watch. A good singer she is indeed - but what's the gain here at the age of DVD and Blu-ray...? Awfully wrong.

""Light"" tenor Juan Diego Florez is better heard than seen, and he is seen a whole lot from the start, looking more like my dentist than he does like a heart throb and hero.  And his acting is -- to put it kindly -- shameful: TOTALLY unbelievable, even by the flimsy standards of bel canto opera; indeed, he comes across transparently as gay.  Patrizia Ciofi is a snaggle-toothed gamine and grotesque in a number of ways, grimacing unpleasantly through her famous early arias.  And to make matters worse, she is forced by her director (or someone else's tawdry judgment) to romp about the stage in the smartly-saluting, wise-cracking fashion of old-time Broadway musicals.  The mostly Italian cast has a great deal of trouble with the libretto's spoken French, and their troubles are exacerbated by a lot more spoken dialogue than you're accustomed to hearing in opera.

The staging is a failure as well.  The French invading Italy during World War II?  Why not have the Dutch invade Morocco, wearing snow-shoes?  The transposition makes no sense and the expectations it unleashes -- of hard-bitten, battle-weary GIs (or their French counterparts, if there'd been any) -- make a hash of the story's whole premise... unless you kindly choose to see this as a light-opera spin-off of the Phil Silvers Show.  I didn't.  And these guys wouldn't have adopted an orphan... period.  A dog, maybe -- and that's what this production, sadly, is.",1202428800,7,1477,4.887550200803213
8122925,1,B000FIGXGM,"I love Italian opera in traditional presentation.  I returned this unopened as when I saw modern dress n the cover which I did not notice on the order page, and I knew it was not for me.  I have seen ""il Barbiere di Seviglia"" in San Fran where he enters riding an electric vespa; also there I saw ""i vespri siciliani"" in 18cent Sicily (the story is Sicilian revenge against French invaders who violated a maiden in 13 century) and they were not there in 18c so historical perspective is lost and the animus they harbor for the French was not present); and ""Don Giovanni"" in Paris Feb 07 which is set in a modern office building-when the don sing 'da vieni a la finestra'- there is no window to be seen, as it is supposed to be a serenade to the donna at a window.  I laughed my way thru my abosolutely favorite opera it hurt so much.  In short, I hate productions which take such liberties.  Just get a DVD with the Sutherland and Pavarotti performance from 1960s, where he made his mark as king of high C's, and I'll buy it!!",1198886400,5,1026,4.268041237113402
