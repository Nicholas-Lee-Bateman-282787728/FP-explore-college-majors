8128555,4,B000G1R344,"This was a very good deal to be able to get both a CD and DVD. The DVD was my favorite because it went into detail about the Rap Music industry on the West Coast and how it has been able to survive Suge Knight , Death Row, and all the negativity that came with dealing with that company and that CEO. People are making good music and living happy lives without threats and intimidation.",1384905600,,386,4.16
8128556,4,B000G1R344,"Not the best DVD, but it was pretty interesting, nothing that you have not heard before. The CD is on hit I must admit though. I didn't like the decptiveness of the title, but it is something worth buying....I got it for $3.",1208476800,,224,4.232558139534884
