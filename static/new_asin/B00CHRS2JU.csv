8581871,5,B00CHRS2JU,"Back before doing Half in the Bag and ripping on the Star Wars prequels, RedLetterMedia made this little home movie. The film is self-aware in its stupidity, the effects are laughable, and the production value is... eh. But that's the whole point of the movie, in that the lighting is bad, the camerawork hit or miss, and how the actors are almost always screaming in order to hide their losing voices. The schlock writing and acting are what make this very entertaining, and it's even better if you're a hardcore fan of the people behind it.

Although the remastered effects aren't exactly anything on scale with Avatar or District 9, they're intentionally bad enough for the tone of the movie, but  good enough to not look painful. Again, the whole movie is supposed to be a big joke. Also, considering how ridiculous the movie is, it manages to make sense and (at least for me) you don't really question why things happen.
The extras for the film include bloopers, commentary from Mike, Jay, and Rich (three of the four main characters), and the documentary detailing how they met and made this gorgeous disaster of a film.

My only complaints about the DVD is that it loses a bit of steam at the halfway point, though it picks itself back up eventually, and I was disappointed to find no original cut of the movie (though I think there might've been copyrighted music in the original, so that's probably why it's not there).

If you're young and wanting to make movies, watch this, it reopened my interest in making them. If you like bad movies, watch it, but don't be surprised if you think the writing is good. If you love RedLetterMedia, you'll have a blast.",1412467200,3,1665,4.653061224489796

8581873,1,B00CHRS2JU,"I'm a big fan of RedLetterMedia's recent work, but this amateur movie they made in their youth is completely inept; not in a charming ""it's so bad it's good"" kind of way, but in the ""It makes me want to kill myself"" kind of way. It's obnoxious, witless, and not nearly as funny as they must have thought it was back in the day. I would suggest a purchase to die-hard fans, if only for the documentary about the formation of Mike and Jay's partnership, but otherwise, I can't recommend.",1403049600,,485,4.4
