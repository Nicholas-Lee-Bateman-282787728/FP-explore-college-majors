2119746,5,B0002TTTGU,"I have had a poor VHS from PAL transfer of this superb production for several years. What a thrill to find it restored on DVD. And what a restoration. The production is stunningly simple, yet utterly dramatic. Linda Roark-Strummer is a ferocious Lucrezia Contarini, the daughter-in-law of the opera's central character, the ill-fated Doge. Renato Bruson, who literally owns this role, gives a heart breaking reading of this great Verdi baritone role. No composer wrote better father/daughter duettos than Verdi, and the ones here rank among his very best.

The mercurial Gavazzeni commands the La Scala orchestra with a style that many younger conductors would do well to emulate. This opera is one gorgeous melody after another. For all fans of beautiful singing. A must.

2119747,2,B0002TTTGU,"'I due Foscari' is one of Verdi's darkest operas. And it has very little stage action. It may be better experienced as a sound recording rather than as a stage production. I've known and loved the audio recording of 'I due Foscari' led by Lamberto Gardelli' made in 1977 for many years. It has a superior cast -- Piero Cappuccilli as the Doge, the young fresh-voiced Jos Carreras as Jacopo Foscari, Katia Ricciarelli as Lucrezia Contarini, Samuel Ramey as Loredano -- and is superb throughout. I have not seen the DVD (or VHS) of the competing 'Foscari' with Nello Santi conducting and the Doge sung by Leo Nucci. But this DVD conducted by Andrea Gavazzeni (not Lamberto Gardelli as the previous reviewer mistakenly says) and with Renato Bruson as the Doge simply cannot compete with the audio recording. With the exception of Bruson, who is in good voice and does a very credible acting job as the conflicted, frail, dying Doge, the cast isn't up to snuff. Linda Roark-Strummer is a bit overparted as Lucrezia; the voice is of moderate size, she sings rather generically and she tends to overact. Much worse is Albert Cupido as Jacopo. His voice is, let's face it, not inherently pleasant and he doesn't handle it well, he strains in the more dramatic bits, cannot sing a legato line and his acting is wooden. (His mad scene in Act II is embarrassing.) Considering that Jacopo dominates much of the action, this is not a good thing. About the best I can say for this production, aside from Bruson, is that the scenery is nice and the costumes are richly gorgeous. And that Gavazzeni gets marvelous playing from his La Scala orchestra. I was particularly struck by the viola/cello duet that introduces Act III.

If you have to have a DVD of this opera, I'd suggest you explore the other version mentioned. If you want the opera for its music, but are not familiar with it, you might consider looking for the old Gardelli set. Also, I know that Bergonzi recorded it under Giulini, but I do not know that performance.

2119748,4,B0002TTTGU,"Who could have imagined the sheer luxury of having not one but two Foscari to choose from on DVD so soon into the medium's life? First we had an adequate performance from Naples which has now been replaced by Renato Bruson, Gardelli and La Scala. Foscari is not top drawer Verdi. Even he acknowledged that. First of all nothing much happens. At the beginning the son is seeking to have his banishment revoked. That does not happen. He is banished again. And his father loses his power as Doge and dies. That's it for a plot. Not much. Ah, but then there is the music and the relationships. Verdi gives us much to appreciate in spite of the lack of action. Only Bruson and Gardelli are known qualities here but the rest of the cast are more than adequate. If you like Verdi beyond the standard rep check this out.",1098489600,14,812,4.42
8031737,5,B0002TTTGU,"An excellent production of this opera. The singing and performances simply put me to tears. The staging, lighting and costumes design are simple. dark and stern that suits this tragedy very well. Bruson came up with another solid, subtle performance.",1469750400,2,250,5.275
8031738,5,B0002TTTGU,I love this opera and always did since Carreras sand Jacopo in the early 80's Great tragic story and somewhat reserved production. Excellent interpretation from the complete cast.,1446768000,,179,5.428571428571429
8031739,4,B0002TTTGU,"I just saw the LA Opera's production of this rare Verdi opera starring Placido Domingo and while the LA Opera's production design and costumes are far superior to this 80's La Scala production, the voices in this video are far superior. Renato Bruson does great early-Verdi. I have La Scala's production of Nabucco with him and he never disappoints.

The production design on this stage is very sparse and makes it hard to get into this already obscure opera, but if you love Verdi and the challenges he gives his sopranos as well as the seamless way in which he goes from a duetto to a terzetto to a quartet, this production demonstrates it effortlessly. Bruson definitely steals the show in the finale.

To his credit, Placido does the same in the LA Opera's production but he definitely tires faster in his old age. His theatricality, however, is matchless! One hopes they have a DVD of the production for the sake of the costumes and production design. The soprano and tenor, however, leave much to be desired. Alas! A great age of operatic voices has ended.",1348358400,2,1062,4.704301075268817
8031740,4,B0002TTTGU,"Quite old this performance, from 1988. Magisterially conducted by Gavazzeni and soberly produced in gran tradition. Here is Bruson at his summit,introverged, reflective, with fine legato and drammatic impact. The tenor Cupido is conventional, often pleasant. The soprano Linda Roak Strummmer puts her heart into her role in a wild way,her vocal effects are uneven and often conventional.",1335139200,2,387,5.689655172413793
8031741,5,B0002TTTGU,"First of all, i am mystified when some people believe that ""HAPPEN""  is physical action,and that if in an opera there is no action, nothing happens. This opera is the best example of this, there is no action in the traditional sense, because almost all the action is in the minds of the characters, what makes it difficult to appreciate if you do not know the language,and even knowing it,if you like physical action. But if you truly like to know an early masterpiece of study of the human psyche this opera must be truly be heard. It reminded me of Beatrice di Tenda, another unjustly neglected masterpiece forgotten because in the traditional sense little happened on it. There is no worst deaf than the one that does  not want to hear. And i believe that if you REALLY know how to hear opera,and know the language, you truly will see that this opera, different from Oberto,Nabucco,I Lombardi and Ernani, is just as good if not better for the reasons above cited. Regarding the performers i have nothing but praise for them, particularly the soprano Linda Roark-Strummer, whose opening lines reminded me  of Maria Vitale, in the recording of this opera with Bergonzi,Guelfi and Giulini in 1951. But what i liked most was the vitality of the conduction of Maestro Gavazzeni. Summing it up, this opera is not for everyone,only for those who know how to appreciate it..By the way,it is based in real facts. That is why, being written by the Venetian Piave was created in Roma, because of censure to not offend the Foscari still living in Venice in the time of its creation.",1300060800,11,1573,4.692028985507246
8031742,4,B0002TTTGU,"I Due Foscari is one of Verdi's grimmest tragedies. It starts gloomy and only gets gloomier.  The music is glorious, but there are no ""hit tunes.""  Renato Bruson sings and acts the role of the Doge Francesco Foscari to perfection.  His voice and body language convey all of the conflicting feelings of his complex character.  Luigi Roni sings his few lines as the doge's nemesis very well. Alberto Cupido sings the role of the doge's ne'er-do-well son Jacopo beautifully and acts the part tolerably well.  Linda Roark-Strummer sings the role of Lucrezia beautifully, but her acting is overwrought.  She is also badly made-up.  The sets and costumes are chillingly effective.  The orchestra supports the singers magnificently.  I have watched this DVD twice and will watch it again, but my wife can't stand the unrelievedly gloomy plot.",1287878400,6,835,5.080882352941177
8031743,5,B0002TTTGU,"This was a great performance of Verdi's seldom seen opera, I due Foscari. Linda Roark-Strummer's passionate portrayal of Lucrezia Conarini was a marvel. I'd call her the star of this production.  But Renato Bruson as Francesco Foscari, the aging Doge, was equally wonderful.  The sets, costumes and supporting cast were quite splendid also.  It's too bad the story is such a downer.",1205971200,5,382,5.129032258064516
8031744,4,B0002TTTGU,"This is not a litle known masterpiece of Verdi. It is a very enjoyable opera but is not in the same class as his better known works.  Conducting and singing is very good, but only Bruson can be called excellent. Costumes are very good, scenery is adequate, sound is Dolby stereo (no surround). If you want to add some lesser known operas to your collection, this is worth considering.",1146355200,7,384,4.565217391304348
8031745,5,B0002TTTGU,"The DVD of 'I Due Foscari' comes from La Scala Milan. In the period of the opera's setting Milan And Venice were deadly enemies. Indeed the tenor character Jacopo is accused of 'trafficking with a foreign power' namely Milan as well as of murder. The opera deals with the dilemma of Jacopo's father, the doge of Venice in having to preside over his condemnation. This conflict between love and duty is a hallmark of Verdi operas and provides the pretext for some heartrending music. Renato Bruson as the doge is majestic as doge and portrays to perfection the father forced to condemn his son to exile and as ever,proves a true 'baritono nobile'. As his son Jacopo, Alberto Cupido sings beautifully but hardly sets the world on fire with his acting . Linda Roark-Strummer as Lucrezia,Jacopo's wife with more balls than her husband or father-in-law sings very strongly and establishes herself as a force in the drama. The other roles are well taken and the Chorus sings strongly. The sets and direction are more than adequate.",1118275200,18,1025,4.829545454545454
8031746,5,B0002TTTGU,"Bruson is dependably great and did his magic here. But the tenor, Alberto Cupido was also remarkably good. True, the opera is a slow starter and there isn't a lot of action in it, but it contains some great music. This recording is my first exposure to this opera. It's clearly not Verdi's greatest work, but even so it is a very fine opera.",1116374400,11,341,4.34375
