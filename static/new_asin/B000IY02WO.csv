2664269,5,B000IY02WO,"I've stated before that the reasons I like TNA is because they showcase two things that the WWE has decided to not put much effort into these days...and the two things that made me fall in love with this business in the first place.  One is the tag team division & the other is showcased on this DVD...the X divsion.  This DVD showcases some X division matches from the past year just like Vol. 1 did.  This release does have some positives & negatives though.

The positives are that they didn't spend the whole DVD on Joe/Styles/Daniels since we've seen those matches on Joe's & other DVDs and just only had around a half an hour of highlights & commentary.  Also in that respect, it gives a great showcase of those X division wrestlers who were overshadowed in that fued like Petey Williams, Chris Sabin, Alex Shelley and the returning Senshi (Low-Ki).

However, the negatives I can say about this is that they really put alot of matches from Impact that either had other outside storylines/interference going on that took away from the match or were a quick squash match.  Also this DVD had too many three/four way matches with everyone getting their high spots in before the finish so it really because repeatitive & loses it value after a while (ala the 5 Abyss thumbtack spots on the ""Bloodiest Brawls"" DVD).  The last X division DVD ended on June of 2005 so while there were tons of matches from Impact, they left out alot of X division matches that were DVD quality that could have been added instead of the repeatitve three/four way matches such as: Petey Williams vs. Jushin ""Thunder"" Liger (Scarifice '06),  the Ultimate X match between Joe/Styles/Daniels (the only match not on DVD yet), Chris Sabin vs. Petey Williams (Unbreakable '05), and other matches from the World X Cup of '06 & the Super X Cup of '05.  Here's a list of the matches & keep in mind that the Impact matches are either kept short & clipped because of a commerical break.

IMPACT: X Division Champion Christopher Daniels vs. Samoa Joe - This match was shown in progress after missing the first 5 minutes (it was shown on the website to get people to turn in right at the start of the show)
IMPACT: Chris Sabin vs. Petey Williams vs. Alex Shelley

IMPACT: A.J. Styles vs. Chris Sabin

Lockdown: Ultimate Xscape Match - Chris Sabin vs. Chase Stevens vs. Shark Boy vs. Petey Williams vs. Elix Skipper vs. Puma
IMPACT: Alex Shelley & Sonjay Dutt (Team USA) vs. Goto & Tanaka (Team Japan)
IMPACT: Jay Lethal vs. Shark Boy vs. Senshi vs. Alex Shelley
Slammiversary: Sonjay Dutt vs. Jay Lethal vs. Shark Boy vs. Senshi vs. Petey Williams vs. Alex Shelley
IMPACT: X Division Champion Samoa Joe vs. Senshi vs. Sonjay Dutt
Hard Justice: X Division Champion Senshi vs. Jay Lethal vs. Petey Williams
IMPACT: Chris Sabin, Jay Lethal, Sonjay Dutt vs. Alex Shelley, Johnny Devine, Petey Williams

Overall, I was very pleased with this DVD...it's just a step down below Vol. 1 but still worth picking up in my opinion.

Side Note: For those getting the Wal-Mart double pack...the X Division Vol. 1 DVD was put into one disc instead of the original two & has the correct match listing on the back.",1159747200,12,3455,4.672158154859967

8147708,4,B000IY02WO,"I really enjoyed the matches selected for this DVD, although I think they could have saved the big Joe/A.J./Daniels feud for the end instead of starting out the whole disc with it. I would have liked to see more Petey Williams and some of the big pops that the X-Division matches produced before TNA started killing it. Overall most of the matches are very enjoyable and I hope they produce a 3rd volume.",1265241600,,404,4.5479452054794525
8147709,2,B000IY02WO,"They clipped and cut matches between the three best X-Division wrestlers today. Of course I am speaking about Samoa Joe, AJ Styles, and Christopher Daniels. There are no triple threats or singles matches with these three.

Who clips matches anymore? I mean c'mon?!

If you want your fill of the other guys this is your DVD, but I wanted something more well thought out not a best of Sonjay Dutt / Chris Sabin DVD.",1247270400,,413,4.5675675675675675
8147710,4,B000IY02WO,"TNA's X Division has a lot of wrestlers that show size does not matter. Though I am a big fam of Samoa Joe, Aj Styles, and Christopher Daniels I couldn't wait to see others shine such as petey williams, sonjay dutt, chris sabin, and others. This is one dvd set you need to own. Here are the matches...

X Division Champion Christopher Daniels vs. Samoa Joe - This was the match that started right after a UFC show ended so people would stay tuned and watch the match, a good match. 8/10

Chris Sabin vs. Petey Williams vs. Alex Shelley - Another great match between these three underused wrestlers in TNA in my opinion. A good match 9/10

Christopher Daniels vs. Matt Bentley vs. Austin Aries - These three put on a high flying match that showed just what they could do when they went against each other. This was another Impact match. 9/10

 A.J. Styles vs. Chris Sabin - Yet another impact match that showed what two of my favorite wrestlers can put on. Probably could have used more time but still good. 8/10

Chris Sabin vs. Petey Williams vs. Austin Aries vs. Alex Shelley - It seems like every match thats on this set is on impact. Too short of a match and another high flying back and forth battle. 7/10

A.J. Styles vs. Jay Lethal - Jay Lethal should have been X Divisin champion a long time before he won it. Nevertheless he proves he can tangle with the best of them in this great short match. 8/10

Other matches include:

Chris Sabin vs. Alex Shelley vs. Sonjay Dutt

Destination X: Chris Sabin vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Petey Williams vs. Puma

Lockdown: Ultimate Xscape Match - Chris Sabin vs. Chase Stevens vs. Shark Boy vs. Petey Williams vs. Elix Skipper vs. Puma

Sonjay Dutt vs. Jay Lethal vs. Shark Boy vs. Senshi vs. Petey Williams vs. Alex Shelley

X Division Champion Samoa Joe vs. Senshi vs. Sonjay Dutt
Hard Justice: X Division Champion Senshi vs. Jay Lethal vs. Petey Williams

Chris Sabin, Jay Lethal, Sonjay Dutt vs. Alex Shelley, Johnny Devine, Petey Williams

This is a good set, the first volume of the X Division is a little better than the second but this is still highly recommended...",1183420800,2,2236,4.497524752475248

8147712,3,B000IY02WO,"I love wrestling. I know WWE is getting stale, but TNA isn't doing much better. I've grown up with WWE, but have grown tired of the company. The next logical step would be TNA, right? I saw it live and wasn't too impressed. X Division is what makes this company run and I got both Volume 1 and 2 for a great deal. I watched it but felt nothing at all. The action is fantanstic but it feels like something is lacking, and all matches seem to be the same; They have a few cool spots, close falls, and a winner. The first dvd was better then part 2. I don't know if i'd recommend it to a WWE fan; Honestly i'm a WWE fan, reviewed TNA, and I think TNA doesnt have anything much better then WWE does right now.",1163548800,,705,4.00709219858156
