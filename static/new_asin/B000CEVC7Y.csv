2460804,5,B000CEVC7Y,I remember this show as a small child and was excited to see it on Amazon.  I have watched it several times.  It is all I remember.,1188000000,,131,3.814814814814815
2460805,5,B000CEVC7Y,Sorry Lucille Ball fans - but Joan Davis should be getting all the fame that Lucille Ball does.  Ms. Davis is a true comedy talent for all generations!!,1168560000,6,152,4.428571428571429
2460874,5,B000CEVC7Y,I bought this for my mom. she loves it and all these old shows. I enjoy watching them too! It shows my generation that there were other great comics of that day besides Lucille Ball... who we ALSO enjoy!,1359763200,2,203,4.230769230769231
2460875,5,B000CEVC7Y,"I wasn't old enough to watch these when they were originally on, but had seen some re-runs and haven't been able to find these shows for years.  I am very happy that somone put them onto DVDs.",1359158400,,192,4.1891891891891895
2460876,5,B000CEVC7Y,Love it and will enjoy sharing with my young nieces and nephew. Joan Davis was the first Lucy. I will be ordering more if they make them.,1355184000,,137,4.111111111111111
2460877,4,B000CEVC7Y,"Good to see these antics again. When I was a child, my best friend and I would have debates about who was better: Joan or Lucy. Actually, ""I Married Joan"" was NBC's ""response"" to CBS's runaway hit ""I Love Lucy."" This is evident in some scenes. Some of Joan's actions seem labored and intentional. While Ms Davis was great, she lacked the fluidity and spontaneity of rubber-faced Lucy. Both, however, affectionately captured the persona of the ditzy, authority figure fearing and challenging post-war housewife. Ever notice that Lucy, Joan, and Margie Albright each had their own variation on an expression of exasperation/ desperation? Lucy had her teeth-clenching, eye popping ""euhhh!,"" Joan had her head-rolling ""pfssuh,"" and Margie had her somewhat gargling ""ggguhh!"" Okay, back to hatching my next scheme, with a backdrop of housework and preparing dinner.",1346544000,2,860,5.2846715328467155
2460878,5,B000CEVC7Y,These DVD's were on my husbands wish list I happened by mistake to find. He was thrilled to get them.,1317168000,5,101,4.1
2460879,4,B000CEVC7Y,"CBS had Lucy, but NBC had Joan Davis and her wonderful brand of physical, knock-about comedy from 1952-1953. Each week, kindly Judge Bradley Stevens counsels folks in domestic court by using examples from his own married life. Joan Davis, a comedic veteran of vaudeville and a long career in films, brings her inimitable comic timing and charm to each of their wonderful misadventures!

The Jailbird - a scavenging crow steals a pearl necklace from Joan's friend Janet, and Judge Stevens suspects his wife is the culprit!
Home Movies - Returning home exhausted and quarrelsome from a Hawaiian vacation, the Stevens invite friends over to watch their home movies with disastrous results.
Wall Safe - The day she discovers an old map hidden in the living room, nothing is safe from treasure-seeking Joan - especially Brad's sanity.
Dreams - Joan goes to her high school reunion and discovers that all her friends have exciting careers and that all she has is Brad.
Changing Houses - Joan and Brad trade spaces with their neighbors' ""modern functional house"" for a week, and after a night of push-button convenience, discover there's no place like home.",1294963200,,1150,5.020942408376963
2460880,5,B000CEVC7Y,"Great old tv show, front runner to I love Lucy or about the same time.  Lots of shows have used the same themes and its still relevant today.  And no bad language.. imagine that lol

2460881,5,B000CEVC7Y,i watched this program when i was a preschooler and later on in reruns. it is pure TV theatre often with only the two stars alone and only a few guests. subtle sight gags and physical comedy that has been copied with over the top exaggeration by ensuing comedians but never matched in quality. i wish she were back with jim backus. i really miss this kind of humor.,1228953600,26,365,4.304347826086956
2460882,5,B000CEVC7Y,I love the I married Joan shows.  I now own 5 DVD'S.  I first saw Joan Davis on the old NICK AT NIGHT.  They showed one episode that I really wanted and was not able to find so far.  It was were Joan opened Brad's package in the closet and it was a blow up boat.  it was just hilerious and much funnier then when Dick Van Dyke did it in the 60's. I wish that the episodes were included with the discription.,1207267200,,407,3.855421686746988
2460883,3,B000CEVC7Y,"I remember loving ""I Married Joan"" as a kid.  Unfortunately, this sitcom doesn't hold up well over time.  The comedy is lack-luster at best.  Buy ""The Honeymooners"" and ""Amos 'n' Andy"" instead. They are both delights that pass the test of time, and I watch them over with great appreciation.  But ""I Married Joan"" just leaves you thinking the 50's were dorky.",1190937600,,359,4.741935483870968
8098408,5,B000CEVC7Y,"I was delighted to have found this set. Love it, not the best quality, but then, it's from the 50's after all.",1455062400,,110,4.045454545454546

8098414,5,B000CEVC7Y,I've heard no complaints or negative comments from the recipient so I have to assume that this should be rated high.,1369785600,,116,4.571428571428571
8098415,4,B000CEVC7Y,My husband loves these old shows. He had never seen them as a child. Joan is an earlier version of Lucy and her antics. Some of them are not extremely clear but most are. But look when these were recorded...long long ago. But still good for a good laugh.,1365724800,,254,4.204081632653061
8098416,3,B000CEVC7Y,"I ordered this set of DVDs because I always enjoyed watching these two stars from long ago.  It was enjoyable to see them again, but I have to admit I was disappointed in the stories.  They did not show these two talented stars at their best.",1363392000,,242,4.239130434782608
8098417,5,B000CEVC7Y,"If you liked I Love Lucy, you probably will enjoy this also. Joan is so silly but so very believeable.",1361923200,,102,4.15
