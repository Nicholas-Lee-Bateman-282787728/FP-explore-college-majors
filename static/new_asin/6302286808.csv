This movie doesn't continue from the first and second volume of bloodfist although it has the same title name but the character has a different name. The main thing is that the fight scenes are just as good as the first two. My favourite fight scene is when he matched up with Stan 'the man' Longinidis an australian and Kickboxing Legend. Bloodfist 1,2 & 3 are far better than the rest of the bloodfist series.",1131321600,,581,4.290909090909091
