With a catchy theme song, funny and memorable characters, and the constant, underlying message of women being able to be girly AND kick butt was nothing short of amazing.  And for a good long while, the show dominated the airwaves and took the world by storm in popularity.  So a few years into the show's run, Japan capitalized on the show's success, and decided to create their own spin off--taking all the familiar heroes and villains and reimagining them as a magical girl anime in a similar vein to Sailor Moon. Though I was able to see various clips on YouTube, it wasn't until recently that I was FINALLY able to dig up the entire English sub and dub of the series online and give it a watch.

The verdict? While the original series will always be my favorite, this alternate take on the Girls is just as fun and heartfelt, and in many respects, is more faithful to the original series in its characterization and tone than the actual, American 2016 reboot.

The series takes place in New Townsville (Tokyo City in the Japanese version). In order to stop an ecological disaster, Professor Utonium's son, Ken, uses Chemical Z, a new form of the Professor's original substance, Chemical X, to destroy a giant glacier. However, the impact of Chemical Z causes several black and white rays of light to appear in the skies above New Townsville. Three ordinary girls, Momoko, Miyako, and Kaoru, are engulfed in white lights and become Hyper Blossom, Rolling Bubbles, and Powered Buttercup, respectively. However, the numerous black lights cause others to turn to the side of evil, so the Powerpuff Girls Z must use their super powers to protect New Townsville from villains such as Mojo Jojo, Him, and Fuzzy Lumpkins, among other villains.

Just one episode in, and the viewer will quickly discover that the direction of this series is vastly different from the original show, in terms of plot. The Professor now has a wife and son (whom I suspect was supposed to be a slight nod to Dexter on Dexter's Laboratory); they have a robotic dog that can call the Girls when needed (serving as a combination of the Talking Dog character and the Powerpuff hotline); the Girls are now 13 years old and going to middle school, instead of being in kindergarden; the three are just best friends and not sisters; they have normal, Japanese names, with ""Blossom"", ""Bubbles"", and ""Buttercup"" just being their superhero names, and other than super strength, speed, and flight, the Girls have magical weapons instead of traditional superpowers.

But other than those main, major changes, the series is still greatly funny to watch, and includes nearly all of the Girls' main rogues gallery, and other than just a few tweaks here and there, they all pretty much act like their American counterparts. In some respects, the anime actually improves on some of them, giving backstories to some of the villains that never got an origin in the American version. We actually get to see Princess' family and discover why she's such a spoiled brat--Sedusa becomes a tragic case of Jekyl and Hyde, in that a sweet young girl doesn't know that she transforms into a monster when provoked, and Him, while admittedly not as scary as in the original show, sees the most development, and has more ties to the Girls and their creation then anyone suspected.

While the series is definately aimed at younger kids in terms of its jokes, it still manages to pay respect to the old show it was based on, and sharp eyed fans of the original series will be able to spot all the homages and Easter Eggs thrown in. Certain plots seem to be based off of classic episodes from the old show--the Mayor is still a loveable oaf--Miss Bellum is still the brains at City Hall (and yes, they still go through the effort of hiding her face)--the Professor is still a loving father and absentminded scientist, and towards the end of the series, they even get their fighting robot mecha, Dynamo. And though the Girls aren't blood related in this version, their friendship and camaraderie is so strong, they might as well be sisters to one another.  And seeing as how the original series served as a playful parody of the superhero genre, anime, and other pop culture, this alternate series does much of the same, only in its case, it pokes fun at various shows and TV tropes from Japan, in particular, the magical girl genre. Anyone who's a fan of Sailor Moon will get a chuckle out of the Girls complaining about their costumes, practicing their hero poses, and trying to act like the heroes they see in comic books.

So to anyone who loved the original series, and wants to see an alternate version that dares to be a bit different, yet doesn't completely destroy what made the old show great, then track down this show and give it a watch. And here's hoping that the series finally sees an American release someday, whether on TV or just DVD.",1484438400,2,5085,4.704494382022472
