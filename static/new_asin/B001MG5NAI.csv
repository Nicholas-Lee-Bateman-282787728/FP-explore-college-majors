8321254,5,B001MG5NAI,"Wow!  What a Divinely Guided Masterpiece!  The DVD subtitle ""A Cosmic Symphonic Ceremony"" aptly captures the grand experience awaiting those who watch this DVD.  I absolutely loved Constance Demby's Live in Tokyo CD when I purchased it years ago.  But the DVD brings the presentation to a substantially higher level of transcendence!  Great production and camera work, fantastic music, incredible sacred visuals and sound abound on this DVD.  Experiencing the DVD in the wee hours of the morning accompanied by only candlelight and incense facilitated a peak spiritual experience similar to the one I had when listening to ""Set Free"" for the first time in 1989!

The 52 minute concert set features excellent transcendent sacred symphonic space music for the first 30 minutes, with interwoven recognizable themes from Demby's landmark CD releases of ""Novus Magnificat,' ""Set Free"" and ""Aeterna.""  The following 8 minutes provides a segment where healing tones, sounds and music are presented through the use of electronic keyboards, hammered dulcimer, and emotive, prayerful vocals. The closing 11 minutes of the show features more ""Novus""-like sacred space music mellowing into a great still shot to close the concert portion of this very moving DVD.

In addition, I thoroughly enjoyed the 27 minute bonus interview!  The interviewer was totally in tune with what Ms. Demby and her music is all about.  Deep topics, insights, and revelations are presented throughout.  I learned more about Constance and her unique blend of Sacred Space music than I previously knew--and I have been following her career and music for nearly 30 years now.  The peaks provided into her recording studio, recording processes, and instruments were quite intriguing.

Kudos!  Job well done bu all involved with this release!  Highly Recommended for both long-time fans of Constance Demby and anyone who would like a great introduction to her music.",1430352000,,1927,5.31023102310231
