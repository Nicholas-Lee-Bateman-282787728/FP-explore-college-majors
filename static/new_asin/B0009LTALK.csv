I had actually seen it on bootleg a few years back, but I simply had to have it in my collection. I must be a little sick because alot of these scenes are horrible and borders on the- too disgusting to view twice- category. However, I suggest this one to anyone that is in touch with their macabre side enough to admit they enjoy this kind of gruesomeness. It is definitely the worst!!!",1241136000,5,484,4.271739130434782
8090034,3,B0009LTALK,"There are a lot more scenes from car crashes and clips you have probably already seen on tv, than any actual bombings or executions. The ones that are on the video, are okay, but for the most part are not the full clips like as viewed yourself via the internet. For those without access to a computer and want to gross out their friends, this is a good choice for that.",1231804800,2,369,4.211267605633803
