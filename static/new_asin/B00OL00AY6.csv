6755666,5,B00OL00AY6,"SECRET OF THE BLUE ROOM.  Universal Vault Release. 2014
This originally posted on The Classic Horror Film Boards.  A nice place to visit for fans of Classic horror and home of the coveted Rondo awards:

No menu as in all these Universal Vault releases.  There is a very slight color burst during the opening credits only.
Excellent quality.  The best I have seen for this title.  Looks like it may be from 35mm elements.  Beware of bootlegs.  This is the actual Universal official release.

There are some reel change circles in the upper left and minor scratches here and there, but not much speckling like there was on JUNGLE WOMAN, another Universal Vault title from this batch.  I notice a strange white line on the left of the image for about half a second at one reel change, but all this is minor.  It's a pristine transfer and this title has never come near looking like this in any of the many boots that I have had over the years.
Of all the still unreleased Universal Horrors, this was the one I wanted the most.  I can still remember seeing it on Shock Theater and being totally taken in by it.  It's classic Old Dark House stuff and a good example of a locked room type mystery.  I was terrified by it when I saw it for the first time.
I was afraid to find out what kind of horrifying ghost or creature could have been infesting that room??  Even the piano is strange looking and weird sounding.
Except for the familiar Swan Lake DRACULA music during the opening credits and the closing cast listing, there is no other music that I noticed.  Instead there is very effective whistling wind throughout much of the film.
The acting is mostly very good to excellent.  Edward Arnold is perfect and completely in charge once he shows up about 35 minutes into the picture.  He's a pure delight whenever he is on screen.
Paul Lucas is also good as the hero.
I especially like Elizabeth Patterson as the cook.  And Arnold's reaction to her as she swears she didn't kill anybody.
The only weak acting for me is William Janney as the youngest suitor of Gloria Stewart.
Top Billed Atwill is excellent as usual, but his part does not have him doing anything out of the ordinary.  He is actually overshadowed by Arnold in their scenes together.

SPOILER:

Even with the non supernatural explanation at the fade, I was not disappointed way back then.  It may seem easy to figure out now, but not to my 9 year old self.  The excellent lighting of the secret passageway is just dripping with atmosphere.  It's a great looking set that may be partially from DRACULA or FRANKENSTEIN.  Seems like I should have been disappointed by this ending, but I wasn't.  It was very late at night when I first saw it so maybe I was relived at not seeing some hideous creature.

The reveal of the killer is very well staged.  The camera is on the opening to the secret passageway and we see about 4 or 5 cops come out before the revelation of the killer.  This is where Janney lets me down.  He should have looked more crazed.  His acting  is very one note throughout the whole film.
The stranger in the woods who turns out to be Atwill's brother is very similar to a situation in HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES and also THE GREAT IMPERSONATION.

Even though there were 2 future remakes of SECRET OF THE BLUE ROOM in the Universal cannon; the average THE MISSING GUEST (1938), and the lively MURDER IN THE BLUE ROOM (1944); this film is actually a remake of a couple of European versions of the Erich Philippi story or novel.  AFI: Erich Philippi (Engels & Schmidt Tonfilm GmbH., 1932)

 The 2 other versions of this that I have in my collection were not in front of me for this viewing, but below are my notes on them from when I compared them some years back.  I would have liked to look at them again to see how accurate my notes were.
The original film is German and the other is Czech.

 Geheimnis des blauen Zimmers (Dec. 1932) The German version.

The Universal re-make from mid 1933 is almost exactly the same shot for shot.  Carl Laemmle, Jr. must have studied this film and pretty much had the director copy it with more lavish sets.  The Blue Room in this film has large murals on the walls.  Even over the entrance.  I like the Uni version with it's paneled walls, but this works as well.
They even seemed to cast the Universal US version with American actors looking very much like these German actors.
The Paul Lukas counterpart even seems to be wearing the same uniform used in this film.  I wonder if they were made available for Universal?  Even that strange piano in the blue room seems to be the same type here.  Not sure what that is.  It looks like a lyre attached to an upright piano.  This instrument is in all 3 versions.  If anyone reads this and knows what it is, let me know.
All of the exteriors in the Universal film are actually taken right from this film and inserted into the US version at exactly the same points.
The corridor leading to the Blue room in this film is actually a bit better here as it is lined with many suits of armor.

At the end the killer, with his injured hand in his coat, reminiscent of Napoleon and thus making me think ""crazy"", awkwardly offers his left  hand to the Gloria Stewart counterpart  and she refuses it.  This makes the end a bit stronger in this version.  Throughout all 3 films she is obviously not in love with him, but treats him with understanding and warmth. Here she is openly upset and rejects him with anger.  In the US version he just walks out not even walking near her. In the Czech version he goes up to her for forgiveness and sadly, she looks away.

Zhada modrho pokoje (Feb. 1933).  The Czech version.

This is also almost a shot for shot re-creation of the German version.  Amazingly it has exteriors exclusive to this version.  There is, for example, an exterior shot showing the police arriving at the castle.  The exteriors of the castle are of a different building.  Then there are the same shots of the car leaving at night and the butler flashing the signals to the stranger, etc.

All 3 versions end with the butler looking straight ahead as he closes the doors to The End, Koneg, & Fin.

So for me, at least, this is a major release as it is the first ever appearance on home video in the US and perhaps everywhere of a Universal Horror from the prime Laemmle era.",1414540800,32,6334,4.423010380622838
6755667,4,B00OL00AY6,"Nothing special, with a hoary old mystery trope at its center and way too many forgettable cardboard characters, but if you love that old Universal pre-code horror look and feel, it's essential for when you need a dose but are way too burned out on THE OLD DARK HOUSE, CAT AND THE CANARY, FRANKENSTEIN, MUMMY, MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE, THE BLACK CAT, and DRACUA. It's not as fun as any of them, but it fits in fine in their company and sometimes fitting is good enough. It's so short though... there's NOTHING else going on except the mystery.",1427587200,,544,4.505050505050505

6755669,3,B00OL00AY6,"I saw a DVD version copied from another source.  It was half the cost of the DVD offered here, but it was watchable, like a VHS tape.  But screen quality is up to the viewer, for some are fussier than others.  I just wanted to see the show and see the mystery.  I like mystery stories, and am a big fan of the novels of Agatha Christie, Ellery Queen, Rex Stout, S.S. Van Dine and others who struck it big in the 20's and 30's.  Hollywood took up the stick with the Philo Vance stories, and devoted attention to mystery movies as B grade filler entertainment as second features along with top grade stuff like the Thin Man series.  Well, here is a B filler that is actually pretty good.  You have an old dark house which seems never to see the  harsh light of the mornings and afternoons, but always is set in the evenings and after midnight.
One night, when a young girl is celebrating her 21st birthday in the company of her father and three men who are her swains, a horror story is told about a room in the house which is seemingly haunted. Some 20 years ago the room was sealed up when yet another mysterious death took place in it.  A challenge is made for the men to spend the night in the room.  The first volunteer disappears during the night and cannot be found, the second man is murdered, what will happen to the third who wants to spend the night there?  What will the police do, and is anyone human responsible?  Well, a young Gloria Stuart graces the screen, Lionel Atwell is a stolid father figure, and Edward Arnold with slicked back black hair conducts the investigation amid a bunch of suspicious characters.  Note Elizabeth Patterson, who plays the cook and is given a juicy supporting part, is an old time actress with a ton of screen credits.  The conclusion comes as a surprise since there is an excellent misdirection to suspect someone else.  Still, mystery fans familiar with locked room stories will be tearing their hairs out at why the investigators did not do one important thing at the beginning of the story and why the mystery of the black cat in the room was not followed up with more diligence.  All in all, well worth the seeing, as long as film quality is a matter of indifference.  More particular viewers may prefer the cleaned up and recent DVD for a sharper picture.",1426464000,,2306,4.42654028436019

6755678,5,B00OL00AY6,"Of all the recent releases in the Universal Vault Series this is the one that I most wanted to see. I found it to be every bit as enjoyable as any of the established classics from the studio's 1930s output. Although it features no 'monster' as such, nor does it have any supernatural angle, it is very spooky and intriguing. I found myself quite engaged on what was going to happen to the 'next' person to sleep in the dreaded 'Blue Room'. There is oodles of atmosphere, a literate script and great acting from everyone involved.

It does feature one of Lionel Atwill's earliest performances (looking most odd without his moustache) and it has the delightful Gloria Stewart in it (from ""The Old Dark House"" and ""The Invisible Man"" - although I've read that she wasn't keen on being contracted to Universal and thought very little of their house-style). The quality of the DVD is superb - it's a vintage movie but still looks like it was made yesterday. It has a sharp picture, clear sound, and looked great when viewed on my projection screen through a digital projector. There are no extras and none were expected or needed. Everything you need to know about the movie can be found elsewhere (in particular, try ""Universal Horrors: The Studio's Classic Films, 1931-1946"" by Michael and John Brunas with Tom Weaver).

I also bought the Vault Series editions of ""Mystery of Edwin Drood"" and ""Mystery of Marie Roget"" but they don't compare so well to this movie. If you can only afford one of these current MOD discs, go for ""Secret Of The Blue Room"" - it's a winner!",1418515200,6,1565,4.646209386281589

Creepy and atmospheric who done it with a great cast and a beautiful print besides. First time on home video. I'm so delighted that Universal is finally taking a nod from Warner Archive and starting to dig into the treasure trove of worthwhile films that haven't seen the light of day in decades.

6755685,5,B00OL00AY6,"Finally Universal got off their collective fannies and dug deep into the vault to bring us this old dark house mystery!! While I'd love a blu ray or even a pressed dvd I'll take what I can get. Three men vying for the love of a woman vow to spend a night in the castle's blue room which has been sealed for 20 years. Three unexplained deaths occurred resulting in its lack of use. When the first volunteer disappears without a trace and the second is killed in the locked room the police come in to investigate. Red herrings, moronic servants and strangers lurking in the house while thunder crashes in the night leads up to a good time in this 81 year old thriller.

It looks far better than the 16mm versions floating around on the internet. One of my favorite underrated Universal thrillers!",1416096000,15,794,4.475862068965517
6755686,3,B00OL00AY6,"Transfer is excellent, and the 35mm print is almost pristine.  Stumar's shadowy cinematography looks magnificent.  Movie isn't up to much, although it's an agreeable hour spent in the company of some favorite 30s character actors, but my heart aches that we can't have James Whale's THE OLD DARK HOUSE (32), a far superior film in the same genre and from the same studio, look like this for our in-home entertainment.",1415404800,12,417,4.942857142857143
8684035,5,B00OL00AY6,"Secret of the Blue Room (1933) is one of Universal Pictures unsung horror masterpieces, and this Vault Series release gives it a much needed facelift.  Probably the finest print you will see without a much deserved restoration, this DVD-R is a beautiful improvement from the rare broadcast prints seen in recent decades.  If you love 1930s mystery and horror films, look no further than this overlooked gem.  Directed by Kurt Neumann (the underrated auteur who also brought us the original, The Fly, in 1958), this swiftly paced (66 minutes), old dark house thriller, features a brilliant cast of genre greats:  Oscar nominee Gloria Stuart, the incomparable Lionel Atwill, Oscar winner Paul Lukas, Oscar nominee Edward Arnold, Onslow Stevens, William Janney, Robert Barrat, Muriel Kirkland, Russell Hopton, and the wonderful Elizabeth Patterson.  William Hurlbuts suspenseful screenplay adaptation of the German film, Geheimnis des Blauen Zimmers (1932), is about a young womans (Stuart) suitor who challenges his two rivals to each spend a night in the blue room of her fathers mysterious old mansion.  Sealed for over 20 years because of the terrible fate that awaits anyone who dares sleep in it, the men agree to the challenge, with terrifying results.  Hurlbuts superb script makes us a part of this frightened group, as we breathlessly attempt to learn what the Secret of the Blue Room is; before another victim must die.  First class production values (studio head, Carl Laemmle, Jr., produced), great acting and the nail-biting story, made Secret of the Blue Room so successful that Universal re-made it twice (in 1938 as The Missing Guest and in 1944 as Murder in the Blue Room).  Stanley Fleischers evocative Art Direction, and the great Charles J. Stumars beautifully gothic cinematography, helped bring this chilling classic to life.  Tragically, Stumar would die just two years after his work here, in a plane crash while scouting film locations at the age of 44.  This is a MUST-SEE for any fan of Universals great horror movies, and it stands out as one of the best of the decade.  I urge you not to miss the chance to add this great title to your collection.",1522108800,,2174,5.0418994413407825

8684044,3,B00OL00AY6,"Universal Studio (or whoever owns them) needs to get its act together in time for Halloween!  The company has offered this title as a single dvd for $20.00!  Go beyond the atmosphere and Lionel Atwill's performance...and what have you got?  One feature that runs 68 minutes!

Now if Universal had any marketing skills...they would take this title, Horror Island (Dick Foran), Mystery of Marie Roget, Man Made Monster (Lon Chaney Jr.), The Spider Woman Strikes Back (Gale Sondergard), Captive Wild Woman (and sequels), and many of their other horror films from the 30s & 40s....and offer them as a box set?  There are at least a dozen that would fit comfortably on 3 or 4 blue ray discs. They just need to be cleaned up a little.

Our calendar says that winter is over, but Universal has been ""asleep at the wheel"" when it comes to releasing these movies.",1427673600,4,854,4.697986577181208
