8508354,3,B0071IBXLY,"On  Disc One form '79 I believe, Mitch looks and acts like he is ""altered"" in some way ... and the performance  suffered !  He is much more on his game on Disc Two ... all in all any fan of this guy should buy these DVDs.",1418515200,,221,3.6595744680851063

8508356,5,B0071IBXLY,2 DVD set with performances by Detroit rock legend Mitch Ryder.  Great opportunity to see Mitch in his younger days (1979) and a more mature Mitch (2004).  These are 2 of my favorite DVD concerts.,1385078400,,196,4.571428571428571
8508357,1,B0071IBXLY,"THE DVD had scratches on it and doesnt play properly.. It stalls on some tracks in the middle of the program. I have to manually advance it because the disk came damaged.

I am going to throw it out. It is disappointing.",1377216000,,220,4.238095238095238
8508358,5,B0071IBXLY,"Attention, attention, attention. Those fans of Mitch Ryder Should take the time To view. Mitch Ryder live at the rock Palast DVD. Mitch Ryder is a very talented emotional Vocalist. His band of musicians were very impressive. Mitch Ryder delivers musical passion. View this DVD if you dare. Good day to all.",1376179200,,306,4.903846153846154
8508359,4,B0071IBXLY,The first of the 2 concerts in 1979 depicted a Mitch Ryder with a serious drinking problem and doubtful future. Fortunately  the audience is German and didn't appreciate how badly Mitch was slurring. Mitch's attempts to engage the audience were pathetic and even the camera started avoiding him. Sad. Thank god the band of young german rockers smoked and Mitch somehow stayed on key.  The 2004 concert is more sophisticated with a stone sober Mitch and older seasoned musicians.  The first concert was blues-ROCK (emphasis on Rock) while the 2nd is BLUES-rock (emphasis on Blues).  My only complaint is that the camerman appears to have a love affair with the American guitarist Robert Gillespie while giving the German guitarist Heiner Witte (same guitarist from the 1979 concert)  a lot less attention despite the fact Witte is clearly the more versatile musician.,1362355200,4,866,5.113475177304965
8508360,5,B0071IBXLY,"I met Mitch Ryder briefly several times more than 45 years ago and read his excellent autobiography about six months ago. The Mitch Ryder-Live at Rockpalast DVD is very good with a lot of songs and comments about his career. I was surprised at how good his voice sounded on both a few newer songs and some of his hits from the mid-1960's. If you're a Mitch Ryder fan, you can purchase his autobiography through Amazon.com and this DVD is well worth the purchase price.",1359936000,3,468,4.517647058823529
