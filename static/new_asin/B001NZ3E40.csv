3724962,5,B001NZ3E40,"Being a die hard Longhorns fan, I was excited when I read a little write up about this DVD in Sports Illustrated.  I was not disappointed.  What a great video.  It was not a dedicated baseball video, which might have bored me to death, but about the life of a man who has made baseball his life.  I thoroughly enjoyed the video and being a youth baseball coach, I gained a lot of philosophical insight about coaching.  This is a DVD that I personally could watch a couple of times a year, and glean something new each time.  In summary, baseball is life, and everything else is just details!",1252454400,,591,4.376146788990826
3724963,5,B001NZ3E40,"This video would appeal to baseball fans in general and baseball coaches in particular.  I am not a University of Texas supporter nor a huge fan of the style of baseball that the Longhorns play.  However, I find this DVD to be wildly entertaining mainly due to the access to private conversations, in-game audio, as well as post-game team talks.  Coach Garrido is a master at communicating his vision of baseball to his players.  As a coach myself, this is the part of the DVD that I find the most fascinating.  I bought this DVD after reading a review of it in Sports Illustrated.  I was NOT disappointed!",1252281600,2,606,4.564814814814815
3724964,4,B001NZ3E40,"We are UT fans and of course love this DVD.  But I think any baseball fan will enjoy it especially if you are involved in youth sports/baseball.  Coach Augie's approach to the game and insight are very intriguing.  Ball players will also likely get something out of it.  This documentary provided a different perspective to the game that impacted our 13 year old ball player son in a positive way.  (Make sure you select the ""sensored"" version as there are a few scenes where the expletives are a flyin'.)",1248912000,,505,4.629213483146067
3724965,5,B001NZ3E40,"Congrats to filmmaker Richard Linklater on his insightful portrait on legendary baseball coach, Augie Garrido.  As a longtime high school baseball coach, I learned a lot and was reminded about the best things we experience in coaching.  ""Eliminate the fear, and it's fun.  Eliminate concern for results, and it's fun.  Do your best--fail--and then do your best again.""  These Augie-isms ring true with my three decades worth experience. And, the occassional profanity-laced tirade made me feel good that I wasn't the only coach who just can't take it when players settle for less than they can accomplish.  The bonus features are great for a coach or anyone who wants to see what really goes on behind the scenes in  baseball program.  To see someone so completely dedicated to a game...it's pretty cool.  Augie's about 70 in human years, but only 12 in baseball years! --Tom D., Michigan",1248307200,9,888,4.98639455782313
3724966,5,B001NZ3E40,"I was fortunate enough to attend the premier of this movie in Austin.  Augie is truly amazing and stands alone among baseball coaches.  He looks to bring the best from his players and from this documentary you see some of how he does it.  Whether he is intensifying his practice sessions or imparting to his boys how to view their position in a game he does like no one else ever has.  Richard Linklater should be highly commended on the quality film that he has produced.  It took dedication, patience, a wonderful directors eye and a love of the game to put this wonderful movie together.  Thank you both.",1247875200,2,607,4.522935779816514
3724967,5,B001NZ3E40,I also caught this on ESPN about a year ago and have been anxiously awaiting the dvd release.  Ordered it recently and can't wait to watch it again!  A very enjoyable and in depth look into college baseball.  If you like baseball you'll love this dvd!,1244419200,2,251,4.413043478260869
3724968,5,B001NZ3E40,"I saw parts of this film on ESPN quite a while ago and have been eagerly awaiting the release of the DVD.  It is almost here!!!!!!  As the mother of two baseball playing boys, this really struck a chord with our household.  The lessons imparted by Coach Garrido to his players, and the respect the players have for him are priceless to see.  Filmaker Linklater obviously has a love of the game of baseball and equal respect for this coach.  I plan on purchasing a copy for not only our household, but for my teenage son's select baseball coach so that the whole team can see it. Only a few boys playing baseball will ever get a chance to play for Garrido, but with this dvd, so many can gain a little bit of his wisdom.  That is PRICELESS!!",1233878400,6,740,4.287769784172662

3724972,5,B001NZ3E40,"I have loved baseball all my life and still play it in my late 40's.  I'm almost embarrassed that it took 6-7 years for me to find this documentary (it was recommended by a friend) I'm also a fan Richard Linklater.  I heard Richard Linklater once say in an interview that ""pressure is a choice.""  Now I know where he got that.  I cannot imagine anyone commanding more respect than Augie Garrido.  I was particularly moved by his comments around discovering who the player is first rather than the conventional coaching method of molding a player in who a coach wants him to be. So true. This is an inspirational documentary that I will evangelize to all my baseball enthusiast friends for years to come.  I wonder what Asian and Latino/Carribean baseball enthusiasts would think of this documentary...this story is so American.",1434844800,,827,4.788732394366197
3724973,1,B001NZ3E40,"The guy seems like a jerk to me.  Let me preface this by saying the Linklater is my favorite director, and I am a big fan of baseball.  But this ""portrait"" did not impress me.

For starters, if this is supposed to be a ""portrait"" then why do I feel like I still don't have a clear picture on who this guy really isas a coach and as a person.

The documentary starts off great.  He is talking about his love for the game, the purity of the game, the deep philosophy behind how he views the game, and his attention to detail.  Great!  He then talks about how he treats players individually, and that the players have freedom to express themselves and create their own identity.  Great!  There were some excellent parallels drawn between life and baseball.  Great!

Then... for the rest of the movie, it's nothing but him yelling at players and umpires... I see the guy ruling over the team with an iron fist, yelling and berating them, constantly putting them down, throwing fitsacting like an arrogant jerkwho believes himself too important to even park in the parking lot (the guy parks on the practice field in spite of parking tickets and this is of course celebrated as another one of his great character qualities).  My impression was not that he is an understanding coach who allows players any room for creativity and identity.  To me he appeared more like a military sergeant at bootcamp more than anything else.",1433721600,2,1419,4.583333333333333

3724981,5,B001NZ3E40,"THE ABSOLUTE BEST baseball documentary out there. This follows Augie Garrido and the Texas Longhorns baseball team through their 2006 season. Garrido is mic'd up and you get close up action with camera's in the dugouts. After watching this video, I immediately sent it to my father, and he then immediately sent it to my uncle. We all enjoyed the insight of Augie's life and all who was interviewed in this documentary. A must see for anyone. Also gives you the option of playing video with or without the cuss bleeps. Family friendly, yet I recommend the adults to watch it in its original beep free form. It will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.",1397606400,,664,4.541666666666667
3724982,5,B001NZ3E40,the best baseball documentary you can buy. This man is the best coach of the past 50 years. I love college baseball because of the great phenominal coaching that you see in the kids every game. extremely inspiring movie. Highly recomended to any athlete.,1395360000,,254,4.795454545454546
3724983,5,B001NZ3E40,"Auggie actually says in the video, ""baseball is not important, its a silly game, its about the players finding themselves. ""

This video has some great lessons for any sport.",1369267200,,174,4.8
3724984,5,B001NZ3E40,This video shows the true passion of a coach.  It shows how you live the game and how the lessons are life long lessons.,1358640000,,120,4.0
3724985,4,B001NZ3E40,Coach Garrido is the kind of coach you want your son to play for. I love coaches that use baseball as a tool to help players grow as young men.,1356307200,,143,3.8
3724986,5,B001NZ3E40,Good background on the life of Coach Garrido and the way he set his life goals early in life and worked hard to get to achieving his dream.,1336003200,,139,4.0
3724987,4,B001NZ3E40,"As a college baseball fan I am somewhat embarrassed I did not watch this documentary till the video of Augie Garrido yelling at his players went viral.  While that clip gives a glimpse into the clubhouse, that rant seems to be the exception rather than the norm for Garrido.

If you are a Texas Longhorn or college baseball fan in general watching this movie is a great way to spend two hours of your time.",1305590400,2,406,4.4
3724988,5,B001NZ3E40,"This is without a doubt the best baseball coaching video that I've ever seen.  It concentrates on the mental aspect of the game & gives players and coaches insight on how to think, prepare, and react during practice or games.  Absolutely terrific.  I highly reccomend it for anyone who is serious about the game.",1252972800,,312,4.7407407407407405
8328453,5,B001NZ3E40,"I bought this video seeking insights on coaching baseball.  Augie Garrido has a very realistic, humanistic view of the game.  Baseball provides life lessons.  Garrido acknowledged this and still managed to get wins and championships.  He talks about how difficult baseball is.  Players are warned they will try, fail and try again.  The process of improving and taking the game a pitch at a time, an at-bat at a time, an inning at a time seems to lessen the pressure of winning and scoring.  Garrido is also a proponent of ""small ball"" (bunting/hitting for contact, rather than swinging for the fences).  In spite of a couple of significant outbursts in the video, Garrido prides himself his relationships with his players and his role as a teacher of the game.  Inning by Inning isn't just for coaches.  Middle school, high school and college athletes, would benefit from watching this documentary.

 Linklater does a great job mixing Garrido's life story, ESPN game highlights, and video from the bench and the locker room.",1519689600,,1025,4.964705882352941
8328454,2,B001NZ3E40,"I was hoping for some sort of uplifting positive portrait of someone who can get others to achieve great things. There was indeed a lot of that, but there was also this strange theme of a guy who is like Bobby Knight in how he verbally abuses students and referees, and how winning at all costs is all that matters. I liked how he was philosophical about the losing nature of baseball and how to move past the setbacks and how to be positive about it all . And then you would get a clip of him freaking out in the dugout, horribly abusing a referee, and just getting overall nutty. Instead of being inspiring, he comes across as someone who has no family, no other interests, and over achieves to prove his father wrong after all these years. He reminded me of Joe Paterno in that winning was all that mattered at the expense of everything else. So, if you are a big college baseball fan and you love stories about leaders like George Patton, Julius Caesar and all that, then this documentary is for you. If you are an average joe, like myself, you may feel a little disgusted.",1499817600,,1077,4.36318407960199
8328455,5,B001NZ3E40,great documentary a must watch even if your not a baseball fan. its more then just about the game,1486944000,,97,4.157894736842105

8328460,4,B001NZ3E40,"Augie Garrido managed College World Series championship teams in 1979,1984,1995,2002 and 2005. This film is a documentary about him, directed by Garrido friend and admirer, Richard Linklater, which runs almost 2 hours. The film puts a great deal of emphasis on how Garrido has been, not just a baseball coach, but a life coach. However, we learn very little about Coach Garrido's life outside of baseball. We learn a little about his parents and where he grew up, but almost nothing about what kind of life the life coach has led. Still, the film moves at a brisk pace and provides some food for thought. He seems to have been very effective at helping his players find the fun in the fundamentals. I was especially fascinated by his competing with the ball concept. An interesting look at a charismatic communicator.",1477612800,,817,4.8428571428571425
8328461,5,B001NZ3E40,Great movie following one of the greatest coaches to ever teach the game. I would definitely recommend watching it as both a player and a coach.,1466899200,,144,4.576923076923077
