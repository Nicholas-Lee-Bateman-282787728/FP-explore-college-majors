8306796,4,B001GQV5T2,"I can still remember seeing Mateen Cleaves, AJ Granger & Morris Peterson when they played as true freshmen @ MSU in 1996.  Cleaves was still recovering from a back injury he sustained in a car accident.  {As a sidenote, the car crash indirectly led to the scandal that was disinterred @ the men's basketball program of arch-rival U-M}  Cleaves was overweight and slow and I had serious doubts that he would ever live up to the hype that he had in coming to Michigan State.

Peterson had some obvious offensive flash, but was a slacker on defense.  Granger was a good shooter, but was a turn-style on defense.  When I recall those days during their freshman years,  I NEVER would have guessed that their final game wearing the Green & White would be in the National Championship game.

Their sophomore year was when MSU men's basketball became relevant to the National scene.  Starting with an unexpected demolition of Purdue @ Mackey Arena, MSU began a surge that has continued to the present day.  They made it to the Sweet 16 before being knocked out by North Carolina.

The following yr, they won the Big 10 championship and made it to their first Final Four in 20 years before bowing out to Duke.  Each year saw tangible progress in the team - and particularly in these 3 players.  It became readily apparent that MSU had found a gem in coach Tom Izzo & it's beyond ironic that there were people who wanted him canned in his 1st couple (rough) years.

In 2000, they put it all together.  As Morris Peterson would say, it was their turn to ""buy some candy"" at the candy store, instead of just browsing around the candy store.  That they did. As seniors, Cleaves, Granger & Peterson all had the game of their life, combining for 58 points vs. the Gators.  Today, 2 of the 3 (Cleaves and Peterson) have their names hanging from the rafters at the Breslin Center.

This DVD is pretty straightforward in that it is the CBS telecast of the National Championship game itself.  Somewhat disappointingly, there are no special features / interviews, etc.  Surprisingly, the DVD cuts off as soon as the game is over & we don't even get to see the post-game activities, including the ""One Shining Moment.""

It would have been nice if the DVD included the Elite Eight game vs. Iowa State.  That game was more-or-less the real National Championship game.  MSU cruised through the Final Four with relative ease, but Iowa State was the TOUGHEST team State had played all yr.  This is not to diss Florida.  The 2 UF teams that won consecutive National Championships in subsequent yrs were far superior to the Florida team that faced MSU in 2000.  Any Gators fan will tell you the same thing.

The commentators Jim Nantz and Billy Packer do a decent job, except for Billy Packer's annoying habit of occasionally referring to MSU as ""Michigan"" and UF as ""Florida State.""  Other than that, the telecast was pretty solid.

The omissions of what's not included on the DVD are why I gave it 4 stars, but even minus the special features, this DVD is well worth having.  There was a personal subplot regarding this game in that both of my parents are UF fans, and MSU had also beaten Florida in football in the Citrus Bowl in 2000.  That was interesting!  All in all, the climactic moment of the 2000 National Championship game will always serve as one of the greatest moments in Michigan State basketball & also one of the greatest moments in the history of organized basketball.  GO STATE!!",1271548800,2,3471,4.619281045751634
