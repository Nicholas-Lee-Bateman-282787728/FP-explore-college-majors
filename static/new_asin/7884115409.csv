The story begins with a man walking along a road. He gets a lift from a truck driver and talks about his past. Tom Joad meets preacher Casey (he lost the call). Tom finds his familys home empty. They gone. Everybodys leaving for California because of the drought (they will be replaced by machines that will cultivate and harvest cotton). One man and a tractor will replace twelve men. The sharecroppers are ejected from their land, tractored out, and will go west. Tommy meets up with his Mom and family. Handbills promise work at good wages in California. The Joad family must leave their home tomorrow. They bought a truck to carry them all. Grandpa is obstinate, but they figure a way to take him. There is a short prayer first. Are those handbills accurate? They stop for gas and buy a loaf of bread. Two for a penny candy? There is an inspection in Arizona. No plants.

They reach California and bathe in the river. [Like a Baptism?] They drive through the desert during the cool of night. There is another inspection. This land is lush and green. Grandma won't continue this journey. They arrive at a Transient Camp. Children are hungry and ask for food. A man arrives with an offer to work; is he on the level? There is conflict and a shooting. A man is arrested. Roses husband abandons her. [Not a unique experience in hard times.] They and others leave the camp. A roadblock sends them north. A passing car tells them of work at the Keene Ranch. We see the conditions there. They have to buy food from the company store and cant walk around at night. There is an explanation, then a struggle in the creek. Casey is killed by the guards. Tom resisted, they are looking for him. Then pay is cut in half, the Joads will leave at night.

They arrive at a new camp run by the Dept. of Agriculture. There home has running water, the people control this camp by electing representatives. A licensed contractor can offer work. There is a school too. Men work at digging ditches for a pipeline. They are warned about a planned riot at the Saturday night dance, a big social event. Visitors are screened. The troublemakers are identified, there are armed accessories outside the camp. But there is no riot, the troublemakers were taken away peacefully. At night police look at license plates; they will get a warrant. Tom dresses and prepares to leave. He talks to his Mom, he hopes to learn more about life. Where will he be? Tom explains in a philosophical way. Goodbye. A lone man walks down a road. The next day the Joads leave for work in Fresno. Ma Joad speaks about her outlook. The people will go on forever. [This is like a newspaper editorial.]

I never read the book and don't expect to. It seems like a fictionalized drama based on real events to educate and entertain. Agriculture is one business that depends on migrant labor to hand pick crops. Machines have replaced a lot of hand labor. [Is there any substitute for vine-ripened tomatoes grown in your garden? If you have a garden.] I wonder how much was edited out of the novel? Like other old movies it tells about the culture of the time. Did anyone have the correct regional accent? Is there any good history book about the Great Depression? Mike Wright wrote a series of books about What They Didnt Teach You About ... which are entertaining as well as educational. Can anyone else do the same?",1505692800,,3398,4.5473856209150325
