Someone called this one a Disney, when it is actually not Disney, otherwise, they'd have a region 1 version.

This version is the one I grew up with and loved it. Great storyline. Doesn't leave out a lot of action.
Disney's version is altered to the point of being something completely different.
For example:  (Disney (D)) (This version (V))
-D:  the horse is another character, V:  he's just a horse
-D:  Toad traded his mansion deed for a stolen motorcar from the weasels, V:  Toad stole a motorcar and the weasels took it by force
-D:  Mr. Winky was the weasel leader, V:  There is no Mr. Winky
-D:  Moley is a clumsy fool, V:  Moley is not a clumsy fool but doesn't understand as much as Rat and Badger
-D:  Toad steals the train home, V:  Toad talks the engineer into helping him
-D:  The gang steals the deed back and runs without fighting, V:  The gang chases all the weasels out by brute force

All I'm saying is if you only saw the Disney version, you're missing out on the REAL story.",1518307200,,1058,4.326530612244898
