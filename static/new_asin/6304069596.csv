ATTENTION Lionsgate Home Entertainment: VCRs are not going to be around forever!  Do us a favor and get this gem out on DVD!",1300060800,2,380,4.478260869565218
8221198,5,6304069596,"I saw this on HBO one day and fell in love with it. I have since bought a copy and watch it once in a while, when I need a laugh. Jonathan Silverman and Dan Cortese (who co-starred together on The Single Guy) play a couple of guys who represent polar opposites among single guys- one is the timid romantic who has trouble getting girls, the other is a womanizing egomaniac who has no trouble whatsoever getting girls. The movie follows them around for a few days as they date, trade one-liners and dating philosophies, play hookey from work, etc. The movie's pretty lightweight as far as plot goes, but it's one of the funniest comedies out there, and Silverman and Cortese have great chemistry as wisecracking buddies. R. Lee Ermey (the drill sargeant from Full Metal Jacket) has a hilarious cameo as a weird guy who tries out his creepiness on Silverman but makes the mistake of catching him on a bad night. This movie is great fun; seek it out.",1014508800,2,947,4.511627906976744
