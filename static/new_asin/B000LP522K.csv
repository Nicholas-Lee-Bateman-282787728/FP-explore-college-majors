Since the positions change, the Master re-orientates himself to show one the front view.  One must not confuse the reorientation as part of the form.",1420761600,,269,4.804347826086956
8162621,4,B000LP522K,"Video is good overall, especially for the price.  The instructor has the politeness to show you side views, not just front, which is a welcome help in attempting to mimic his movements.  There's no combat or chi-kung explanaions, only coreography to mimic. Also beware that this is real Baguazhang, but an older style than what you probably saw at your local studio, so make sure you buy a video for the specific form you want to learn.  Again, for twenty dollars, and for the Old-Eight-Palms bagua, this is probably the best video for your money...oh yeah, hope you like reading subtitles.",1237593600,10,590,4.821782178217822
