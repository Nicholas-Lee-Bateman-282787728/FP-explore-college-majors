8056243,3,B00005ICFV,"The main editorial right above clearly says ""2000 season"". That's just how they name this series, with the year of it's production after the end of the season. Why are you crying like you got taken by some corporate ploy? Pathetic. Maybe it is misleading, but they didn't do it intentionally to screw Pats fans. Remember, they also produced a Ravens video. How many of them didn't buy because they thought it wasn't their title year. These guys should consider changing the years on their videos, but they're not trying to swindle anyone.",1031356800,,538,4.795698924731183
8056244,1,B00005ICFV,"It is my own fault for not looking at the editorial reviews before I bought this video. However the title was completely misleading. It turns out that the ""New England Patriots 2001 Team Video"" is all about the 2000 Patriots; their 2000 games, and their 2000 players. What a disapointment!! I wonder how many others fell for this misleading sales promotion? Clever these guys to put in ""2001"" instead of ""2000"". Of course how many videos would they have sold if they were up front and honest about the title. Not many I suppose. Thus, the end justifies the means, all in accordance with the prevaling (Enron) corporate values.",1016755200,17,626,4.752293577981652
8056245,1,B00005ICFV,"This is not the 2001 Patriots video, its the 2000 patriots video.  They made a mistake and ripped me off.",1015891200,18,105,4.25
