I'm already waiting for a season 3! =D",1369872000,,125,4.7272727272727275
5462359,5,B00AO05ABK,This is the second part of a two volume set.  The characters are interesting and consistent and the plot is good enough to pull the viewer through all twenty-six episodes.  Plenty of believable action and plot twists that build suspense.  It does not have a lot of fan service and does not need it.,1367712000,,298,4.481481481481482
5462360,5,B00AO05ABK,"This story was well planned, superbly written and the illustrated details were impeccable.

The anime grabbed my attention from the moment the music began playing in a neo-gothic / steam punkish high energy intro, to the personality of the characters, to how quickly the story developed.

They intentional mystery was well balanced with adequate character development and a very well crafted plot.

This is a very mature anime [not because of sex but because its simply mature] yet its by no means boring!

The violence is mild, the romance is tame and yet its enough to keep you glued to the edge of your seat every step of the way.

I  must say, very few gems come along like this one!

I give it five stars out of five.

5462361,4,B00AO05ABK,"Marika and her crew have overcome some major obstacles. Now, there is mysterious power in space. Pirates are being targeted and their ships destroyed all over the frontier. It also seems that the pirate hunters have inside information that allows them to know the location of the Bentenmaru at any given time. Marika must unite all the pirates in the frontier and confront this dangerous new. enemy.

After enjoying the first part of this series, I really expected it to come alive and blow me away in the second half. That just didn't happen. Most of the second part of this series was spent goofing off. The world created in this anime was obviously huge, and there was so much potential for a grand story. I expected something akin to Outlaw Star. I felt like it was going to achieve what Angel Links could not. It didn't live up to my expectations.

So far all I have done is talk about how it fell short. It wasn't all bad. The story is fun. It's very light hearted and easy to enjoy. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are all very good. This anime doesn't ever get too serious. That's not what it was shooting for. It was about space battles, girls in mini skirts with a dash of yuri thrown in there for the fans. I admit that I did enjoy this anime quite a bit, but I can't help wishing that it had been a little more serious. A little more drama would have done wonders for the story. I can't guarantee that this show is for everyone, but I do think it's a safe bet. If you want to be sure, I definitely recommend checking it out online via crunchyroll or something. It's worth giving it a chance.",1362441600,4,1615,4.38

8555026,5,B00AO05ABK,"Collection 2 is the continuation of the series and the finale, and includes the final 12 episodes

Actually a very good sci-fi action story, treats a group of high school girls as highly intelligent, and not just eye-candy.  Actually not very much fan-service in this one, (and while I like fan-service as much as any average male, I was delighted with the fact that the girls' smarts and actions were much more of an integral part of the story than their looks (although they were not bad looking), at least we weren't subjected to endless panty-shots and over-size falling out cleavage, but be aware there is a little tastefully handled yuri in this series.

Interesting that the BluRay version was actually cheaper than the DVD version (I have both, both purchased on Amazon).",1422057600,,779,4.842105263157895

8555029,4,B00AO05ABK,There are some deleted scenes and missing dialog from the English 2.0 HD track.  I have not watched the Japanse with subtitles to see if those missing scenes and dialog is restored.  It is a good series for the whole family.,1395532800,,224,4.439024390243903

8555032,2,B00AO05ABK,If u like uneventful boring anime you will like this cause nothing really happens other then showing people in a space ship and how to run it. Instead of bodacious it should be boring space pirates.,1376956800,,198,4.527777777777778
