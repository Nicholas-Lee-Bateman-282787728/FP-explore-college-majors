8509820,5,B0074FVU6C,"Ladies if you want a excellent romance movie you need to watch Cenerentola. I first seen it on YOU TUBE! It had English subtitle which helps!
This is an Italian Cenderella movie which takes place back in the 1950's Italy.. I order this movie, but I wish it had English subtitles! It was originally filmed in English language, with Italian (sub). Well it's worth watching, so anyone out there if your looking for a beautiful romance movie buy Cenerentola :))",1419206400,6,457,4.725
