7827084,2,6302462061,"Why do Europeans take that most American of art forms, the comic strip, more seriously than us Americans? The medium of comics finally receives the documentary treatment in a series not from America, but Europe.

For decades, the great American comic strip was badly in need of serious study in a film documentary. (I even went so far as to suggest such a thing in a letter to the producer of ""Jazz"" and ""Baseball"", Ken Burns. He politely declined.) ""History of the Comics"", however, is a mixed blessing.

 Part 1 of this presumably British-Spanish co-production (the credits are in a language that looks like Basque or Catalan, and features a male narrator with a plummy British accent) traces the origins of the comic strip from the sequential drawings of Rudolf Topfer in the 1830s to the serial ""adventure"" strips of a century later. Unfortunately, along the way it is riddled with half-truths, questionable claims, and outright errors. For one, it says that ""Dick Tracy"" began several years after Al Capone's death (in fact, it premiered in the Chicago Tribune in October 1931--Capone died almost sixteen years later)....

It further betrays its European origins with a strongly Eurocentric bias, championing the claim that the British ""Ally Sloper"" (1884) was the first continuing comic character. Well...maybe, but it was not the first comic STRIP, as its Brit supporters would have us believe. The first comic strip in the modern sense of the term was the ""Katzenjammer Kids"" (1897), combining all the comic-strip conventions and symbols we know today. Speech balloons, ""z""'s and sawing logs for snoring, stars for pain--all that can be traced to the ""Katzies.""

It does, however, take an interesting approach in comparing the comics of the early part of the last century to the modern art movements of the time. ""Krazy Kat"", George Herriman's masterpiece (1913) shows strong Surrealist influence, we are told. Lionel Feininger, we are surprised to learn, not only began one of the earliest! modern art movements, but drew a comic strip for a brief time.

Interspersed throughout are interviews with greats like Lee Falk (""The Phantom"") and Burne Hogarth (""Tarzan"") but they are all too brief, standing out like glittering jewels in a junkyard. It IS interesting to see the many wonderful old drawings of classic strips, but the production is marred by cheesy (even for the time) computer effects.

Despite the obvious imperfections, I reluctantly recommend this for the aspiring comics historian, as it proves something I've always believed--the comics have had a profound effect on our culture, and vice versa. Those wishing for a truly entertaining documentary, however, will have to wait for Ken Burns to change his mind.",991267200,5,2733,5.114349775784754
