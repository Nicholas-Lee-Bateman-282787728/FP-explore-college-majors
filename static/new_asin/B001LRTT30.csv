3690964,4,B001LRTT30,"""Bewitched""  continues to  be a delightful brew of  fun and magic.  The Season Seven DVD set, which devoted fans will undoubtedly purchase post-haste,  includes Episodes  # 201-228 of the series.
During the hiatus between Season 6 and 7, several ""Bewitched"" sets caught fire. This led producers to shoot an eight episode story line on location in the summer of 1970. Fondly known as ""The Salem Saga,"" these episodes are  especially beloved by fans. Viewers will note that Samantha and Darrin's kitchen at home is completely different; the result of set  remodeliing after the fire.
  While attending an important Witches Convention in Salem, Massachusetts, Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery)  is persued by a ""hot bed warmer""-- actually a warlock named Newton (Noam Pitlik) that  Cousin Serena (Elizabeth Montgomery's other delicious series role) had hexed several centuries earlier. Serena causes furthur chaos when she transforms Darrin (Dick Sargent) into a statue. She subsequently turns the statue into a man (Robert Brown) so she can date him. Upon returning home, Samantha is immediately zapped back to Olde Salem-- a magical mistake by Esmeralda (Alice Ghostly)-- and Darrin is zapped back in time to rescue her.
  Season Seven guest stars include Jane Connell (High Priestess Hepzibah), Bert Convy (Paul Revere), Imogene Coca (Mary, The Good Tooth Fairy) and Tom Bosley (from ""Happy Days"" and ""Murder, She Wrote"") as Ferdy, an old boyfriend of Esmeralda. Other special Season Seven episodes include the following:

""Samantha's Pet Warlock: Noam Pitlick returns, this time as Ashley, a warlock boyfriend of Samantha's who, hoping to cause trouble for Darrin, transforms himself into a dog.

""Samantha's Old Man"": Makeup artist  Rolf Miller received an Emmy nomination for his outstanding work in this episode. Endora (Agnes Moorehead) zaps Darrin with a spell that ages him 30 years (or more!) so Samantha will see what he looks like in old age. Samantha simply counters that she will transform herself into an old lady and look the same age as Darrin; much to Endora's displeasure.

""The Coursican Cousins"": Endora casts a spell that puts Serena's personality on Samantha. Samantha's mood swings wildly just as she hosts a luncheon at home. Endora cures Serena's sadness with ""Witches Kickapoo Joy Juice"", causing Samantha to become simultaneously drunk. Darrin says , ""You may not believe this Larry, but I'm married to a witch.""

""Sisters At Heart"": This extra-special Christmas episode (airing December 24, 1970) received the Govenor's Award at the 1971 Emmy Award Ceremony. This episode, written by the 10th Grade English Class at Jefferson High School, addressing racism and true sisterhood, is (according to Herbie J, Pilato's book ""Bewitched Forever"")  Elizabeth Montgomery's favorite episode of the entire ""Bewitched"" Series. Includes the original  ABC Network opening and closing ""tags"" by Elizabeth Montgomery,

  ""Mother In Law Of The Year"": Endora and Samantha keep switching places and identities during a live TV commercial for Bobbins Bonbon Candy.

""Mary, The Good Fairy"": Imogene Coca guest stars in this two part episode. Mary is tired of her job, leaving Samantha stuck as her substitute-- and in her fairy costume.

""The Return Of Darrin, The Bold"": In this semi-sequel to the Season 3 episode, ""A Most Unusual Wood Nymph,""  Endora and  Serena conspire to turn Darrin into a warlock.

""The House That Uncle Arthur Built"": Paul Lynde makes his last series appearance as Uncle Arthur. Hoping to marry a snobby witch, Arthur leaves all his practical jokes with Samantha and Darrin.

""Samantha And The Troll"": Serena substitutes for Samantha at a dinner party, and becomes overly affectionate with one of Darrin's clients.

""This Little Piggie"": Endora turns Darrin ""pig-headed"" (literally!), just as an important client arrives at Samantha and Darrin's house.

""Mixed Doubles"": Producer/Director Richard Michaels said of this wild episode, ""we had Samantha in bed with Larry (David White) and Louise (Kasey Rogers) in bed with Darrin... (the result of a weird ""molecuar disturbance"")... that was about as racy as we got on the show.""",1233705600,8,4156,5.316998468606432
3690965,4,B001LRTT30,"Season 7 was delivered to my door yesterday and I was surprised to find that they added an small extra. ""Sisters at Heart"" contains the original opening and closing remarks by Elizabeth Montgomery. This probably hasn't been seen since the original broadcast in 1970 because the sponsor, Oscar-Mayer, is mentioned and the logo is in the background. It was nice to see that they added an extra, finally. I'm hoping Season 8 might have some outakes, the E! True Hollywood Story of ""Bewitched"" or an interview with Erin Murphy and/or Bernard Fox!!",1233705600,5,543,4.913043478260869
3690966,5,B001LRTT30,"""Bewitched: Season 7"" (1970-71) begins with a lot of fun as Samantha and Darrin visit Salem and you can only imagine the comical  hi-jinx that are awaiting our favorite bewitching couple!  From magical antique ""bed warmers,"" trips back in time, magic potions and even a visit from Mary The Good Fairy, Season 7 is as wonderfully entertaining as ever!  Here is a look at this season's  28 episodes:

 1- To Go Or Not To Go, That Is The Question (part 1)
Samantha gets a call from the High Priestess of Witches, Hepzibah, to attend a meeting in Salem, Massachusetts, thus beginning the Stephens' first serial vacation. When Samantha doesn't answer, the Priestess herself appears in the Stephens' home. Hepzibah does not approve of Samantha's marriage to Darrin and decides to break it. She then changes her mind and observes Sam and Darrin's marriage, for if she doesn't like it......

 2- Salem, Here We Come (part 2)
Samantha and Darrin are under close supervision by Hepzibah. How is it possible for a witch and a mortal to be married and happy at the same time. Hepzibah then meets a client of Darrin's named Ernest Hitchcock and, thanks to Samantha, Hitchcock falls for the Priestess. The Priestess then rules out that the witch/mortal marriage is a great thing after all when she invites Sam and Darrin to go to Salem.

 3- The Salem Saga (part 1)
In the very first day of their Salem vacation, Darrin and Samantha gets into serious trouble. While taking a tour of the House of the Seven Gables, a magic bedwarmer follows Samantha. The bedwarmer even follows them to their hotel room and the tour guide calls the police because she thinks that the Stephens stole the bedwarmer. Darrin gets taken to jail, leaving Samantha to get him out and to get to the bottom of this bed warmer mess.....

 4- Samantha's Hot Bed Warmer (part 2)
While Darrin sits in jail, Samantha finds out that the bedwarmer is actually a warlock trapped by one of the witches. Sure enough, the culprit is Serena. Samantha sends Serena back in time to get the spell used to transform the warlock in the first place. With one situation out of the way, Samantha faces another one- getting Darrin cleared of a crime he did not commit.

 5- Darrin On A Pedestal
Darrin and Samantha are sightseeing in Gloucester one day when Sam is called away for a special witches' meeting. Sam suggests that Serena accompany him, which turns out to be a great mistake when they comes across the Fisherman's Memorial statue. To find out more about the statue, Serena blinks him to life and in turn, replaces the statue with Darrin! Larry and a new client, Mr. Barrows, decide to meet Darrin and Samantha does all that she can to get Darrin out of a very preposterous situation.

 6- Paul Revere Rides Again
A classic Paul Revere teapot is taken by Esmerelda, who pops in Salem to bring Samantha's souvenirs home. Sam wants Esmerelda to return the Paul Revere teapot, but she returns Paul Revere instead! Revere thinks that it is 1776 and when he overhears one of Darrin's new clients say that he will ""take over the American market"" with his product, he rides his horse and does his famous call. After a series of misunderstandings, the teapot is returned and the image of Paul Revere riding his horse is used as a successful campaign.

 7- Samantha's Bad Day In Salem
Another boyfriend of Samantha is still chasing her. The boyfriend, Waldo, wants Samantha so badly that he blinks up his own Samantha and take her around town. Larry sees Waldo and his Samantha together and thinks that the Stephens are breaking up. Darrin finds out from Larry and he confronts Waldo, only to be turned into a crow. The real Samantha finds out as well and she demands that Waldo turn Darrin back. Then they explain to Larry that Serena was with Waldo at the time that he seen them.

 8- Samantha's Old Salem Trip
The Stephens come home, only to have Esmerelda blink Samantha back to Salem -- circa 1600! Darrin has to go back in time and bring Samantha, who has no memory of who he is, back home. He has to place a coin on Samantha's head and have her say an incantation so she can remember again. He tries to get her attention and ends up getting accused of witchery! Samantha puts two and two together and goes along with the incantation.

 9- Samantha's Pet Warlock
Deja Vu! A warlock named Ashley comes to free Samantha from her mortal life and he ends up turning into an unusual dog. Samantha sees through his wet-nosed charade and wants him to help Darrin with his dog food account.

Too late, the Tates spot Sam and old-man Darrin and she introduces him as Darrin's grandfather, Grover Stephens. Larry plays matchmaker when he brings his widowed aunt Millicent to woo Grandpa Stephens. To break up the date, Sam turns herself into an old woman who poses as Grover's wife! Samantha decides to stay an old woman as long as Darrin stays an old man, and Endora has no choice but to turn him back to normal.

 11- The Corsican Cousins
Endora wonders why Samantha can't be more like Serena- spontaneous, free-willing, and loose. Endora puts a spell on Sam that makes her do exactly what Serena does. This causes problems for Darrin, especially when he has to deal with a all-business type client. Darrin is almost out of a job until Larry discovers that the client is linked to the underworld, and Darrin's job and sanity are saved again.

 12- Samantha's Magic Potion
Darrin isn't doing very well creatively and decides to take a vacation. When he returns, he comes up with a sure-fire sales pitch for a very strict client, who rejects him on the spot. Darrin blames his creativity block on Endora and wants Samantha to give him some magic creativity. Samantha gives him a potion that ensures great confidence and presents the client with the same rejected idea, which passes. Samantha tells him that his confidence was his own and that the potion was nothing more that soda pop.

 13- Sisters At Heart
Darrin's friends, Keith and Dorothy Wilson who happen to be black, invite their daughter Lisa to stay with Tabitha on Christmas Eve while they go away. Lisa and Tabitha want to be sisters because they get along so well with each other, but are discouraged when someone tells them that they can't be because Lisa is black and Tabitha is white. Of course, this gets out of hand when Darrin's newest client, Mr. Brockaway, visits his home. Lisa is asked to answer the door, and Brockaway gets a shock when he sees her, thinking that she is the Stephens' child! He turns Darrin down because of his bigotry. Tabitha lets Lisa in on her witchcraft and uses wishcraft to blink polka dots on both her and Lisa. Samantha then tells them that they don't have to look the same to be sisters because they are sisters at heart. Then, after a well-deserved lesson from Samantha, Mr. Brockaway admits that he is a racist and wants Darrin to handle his account as his apology.

 14- Mother-In-Law Of The Year
Endora presents an idea for a great campaign for the Bobbins Bon Bons account, and Bobbins takes a liking to her. He insists that she promote her idea on a TV show, which she refuses due to a ski date. So Samantha poses as Endora, but the deception is short-lived when the real Endora appears, magically, on live TV. Because of the special effects, Bobbins is sold on the idea.

 15- Mary The Good Fairy (part 1)
Tabitha loses her first tooth and is visited by the Good Fairy, who is an old friend of Samantha's. Mary, the Good Fairy, has a cold and Samantha gives her some brandy to make her feel good- a little too good! When Mary is too drunk to perform her nightly duties, Samantha steps in and takes her place....

 16- The Good Fairy Strikes Again (part 2)
Samantha is not having a good time moonlighting and wants Mary to take her wings back. Mary then finds out that her costume is used as a marketing ploy for a Reducealator campaign set up by Darrin. She then wises up and takes her job back, and wins Darrin the Reducealator account.

 17- The Return of ""Darrin The Bold""
Endora and Serena give Darrin powers unknowingly when Serena goes back in time to the 14th century where Darrin the Bold reigns. She has altered the future of Darrin when she puts a spell on Darrin the Bold. In the present, Darrin starts wishing for stuff and he gets it. Samantha finds out about Serena's plan, goes back to the time of Darrin the Bold, and takes off the spell.

 18- The House That Uncle Arthur Built
Uncle Arthur's new flame, Aretha, is not happy about his practical jokes. To please her, his practical jokes are installed in the Stephens' home where all hell breaks loose. Samantha tells Arthur that Aretha isn't worth putting her and Darrin through a lot of trouble and he puts their house back to normal.

 19- Samantha and the Troll
Samantha goes away for a 10,000-zap checkup and Serena takes over for her at home. All trouble ensues when she weasels her way into Darrin's life when he is trying to impress another serious client. Samantha comes home to witness Serena acting up and straightens things out. All is well, until one of Tabitha's toys, a troll, comes to life and starts embarrassing Darrin in front of his prospective client!

 20- This Little Piggie
Endora says that Darrin is pig-headed and proves that by blinking a pig's head on his body! This is a catastrophe for Darrin, but turns out to be a great ad campaign for his new client.

 21- Mixed Doubles
Samantha wakes up one morning to find herself in Larry's bed and Lousie in Darrin's! Sam tries to find out what is going on here when Larry knows her as Louise and Darrin knows Louise as Samantha. Dr. Bombay is called and it seems that Sam was so worried about Louise, they magically got switched.

 22- Darrin Goes Ape
Darrin learns that Serena is not to be messed with when she turns him into an ape.

 23- Money Happy Returns
Endora accuses Darrin for being too cheap when she notices Tabitha and Adam playing in a wading pool when they should have a real pool. She blinks one up, and Darrin takes an unnecessary swim! Darrin warns Samantha to keep Endora at bay. Than, he finds a bag full of money- $100,000 to be exact! Darrin thinks Endora whipped up the cash, but it really belongs to a thug who wants his loot back.

 24- Out of the Mouths of Babes
Darrin gets changed into a little boy again when he bans Endora from taking Tabitha to a supernatural event. As a boy, Darrin beats the pants off of a few boys in a basketball game. One of the boys, Herbie, wants Darrin to play in a championship game. Darrin, throughout all this, is in the middle of working on a new account for Irish Stew which is not selling at all, but by the end, the stew is fit for dogs.

 25- Sam's Psychic Pslip
Samantha cleans up the house by her magic, and Darrin catches her! Feeling guilty about herself, she gets the hiccups and pops up many, many bicycles! They have to hide the magic evidence because Darrin's mom is coming. When Phyllis does come, Darrin pushes her upstairs so Sam can call Dr. Bombay to get rid of the bikes. But her hiccups come back when she and Phyllis are shopping. Instead of bikes popping up, an item in the store disappears! When Phyllis and Samantha are doomed to go to jail, Dr. Bombay comes back and gives her the right spell.

 26- Samantha's Magic Mirror
Esmerelda is depressed because her old boyfriend is coming to visit her and if he sees that her powers are not all that great, he will not like her (Sounds like Episode 47, doesn't it?). Samantha gives her a makeover, which is not so good. Esmerelda wants to see how she looks in a mirror, and Sam enhances all of the mirrors in the house to make Esmerelda's reflection appear more attractive. When Ferdy comes by, she discovers that his powers aren't what they used to be either.

 27- Laugh, Clown, Laugh
Endora claims that Darrin has no sense of humor, so she puts a spell on him, turning him into a comedian. His client, Mr. Jameson, does not like Darrin's new Def Comedy Jam phase when he gets a migraine headache. Darrin discovers that Endora has hexed him, and she gives him another spell -- this time, making jokes of anything sad or discouraging. The Jamesons come by and at the very mention of Jameson's wife's bursitis, Darrin starts laughing. Thinking that Darrin's insensitivity will cost Larry and him the account, the Jamesons think otherwise and give McMann and Tate the account.

 28- Samantha and the Antique Doll
Phyllis is beside herself when Samantha makes her think that she has magic powers. It takes Frank to be turned into a mule and a mock seance to put some sense into Phyllis.",1233619200,6,12711,4.5418309242225146
3690967,5,B001LRTT30,"Yes indeed this is great news that Season 7 is due to be released.  I remember buying a VHS tape which contained the first episode in B&W and about 3 other episodes and to my knowledge until the first DVD no more made videos were released here in the UK - we had to record them from TV.  So I was delighted when Season 1 made it to DVD (my favourite episode had to be ""Mother meets what his name"").  I have purchased all seasons to date as they were released some in the UK and others while in America. (Thank goodness for multi-region).
Back in 1992 while in a London bookstore, I purchased The Bewitched Book (Herbie J Pilato) a fantastic episode guide which all fans should not be without.  This has been a great read over the years and at the time I used to wonder if any of these episodes would see light of day again.
So Hooray for Season 7's release - I've only seen the 7 Salem episodes on UK TV, and look forward to ""Mother-in-Law Of the Year"" and ""Mary, the Good Fairy"" episodes.  Will miss Uncle Arthur in the final season (#208 was his last appearance) as much as we did the wonderful Aunt Clara (Marion Lorne) when she bowed out at the end of Season 4.

As Frank C. Murillo ""movie man"" says in his review - they don't make them like that anymore - how true that statement is.  I grew up with Bewitched and will continue to enjoy them for many years to come.  If you don't have them in your DVD collection, or have never seen Bewitched, do so today - I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",1233014400,6,1501,4.1875
3690968,5,B001LRTT30,"This is the first of the start of the last two seasons they both start on working vacations  but this one starts in Salem and it was in actual Salem So it was interesting to see how they did that with all the special effects  that are involved with that series.  They had great Guest stars such as Ron Massak (Who would later become Sherriff Metsger in Murder, she wrote ) and Don Marshall ( Dan From Land of The Giants ) on a special Christmas episode which a group of students wrote .

So if you enjoyed the first 6 seasons then you will enjoy this season and it is a must for every Bewitched Fan",1230508800,17,598,4.085470085470085
3690969,5,B001LRTT30,"It has taken so long for Bewitched to come to dvd, when season one and two came out I thought, it's Bewitched the rest of the seasons will come shortly, wrong,its been a long wait and I almost regretted tossing out my VHS copies I made on tv long ago, but now they are coming out and I can see some episodes I have missed terribly by tossing my VHS out, if season seven is coming out now it can't be too long before the final season 8 is released with still some gem of episodes to the end, I think Bewitched was up for a ninth season but prouducer william asher was devorcing wife Liz and picked up Temperatures Rising to hurt her plus she was tired of the show after 8 years too, afraid of being typecast as Samantha she turned to tv movies and proved she was and awesome actress in many tv movies that were just wonderful and proved she could do more than Samantha (Which she born to Play). She probably would have done a ninth season had ABC not pulled the plug then. But at the time Sargent was signed to show ABC at the time opted to give Bewitched four more seasons but of course only three were completed. I don't think there is any one in the world who doesn't like the show its a trully timeless classic with so many episodes a rare gem in tv land THEY JUST DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THAT ANYMORE!",1229558400,24,1302,4.1299212598425195
3690970,5,B001LRTT30,"Hey everyone the 28 episodes of Bewitched Season 7 is coming to us this February. This includes the Salem Saga episodes, everybody's favorite Christmas episode from Bewitched ""Sisters at Heart"", and ""Sam's Old Man"".

The Seventh Season begins with ""To Go or Not to Go that is the Question"". This is the Episode where Hepzibah demands that Sam come to the witches council which is held every one hundred years in Salem and finally in Part 2 Endora convinces Hepzibah to allow Darrin to go. The Salem Saga begins with the third episode of the 7th Season and continues for 6 episodes.

Also in the 7th season we see more of Esmeralda up to her fading magic and we see Sam's egotistical former boyfriend who turns himself into a dog. Two of the best episodes from Season 7 are ""Samantha's Old Man"" where Endora turns Darrin into a 73 year old man and the best Christmas episode Bewitched had during it's 8 year run ""Sisters at Heart"", and that dealt with racism. That episode was written by a tenth grade class at Thomas Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, California.

Other classic episodes are ""Mother-in-Law of the Year"" and the special effects in the episode are amazing. We see Samantha playing the tooth fairy in the 14th episode which includes two parts in ""Mary the Good Fairy"", which guest stars the all time hilarious Imaogene Coca. This season also is the last season to feature Uncle Arthur, and he makes his final appearance in ""The House That Uncle Arthur Built"". He leaves all his practical jokes at Sam and Darrin's to impress his new girlfriend, but soon realizes if she doesn't love him for him she isn't worth it.

One of the wildest episodes from Season 7 is where Sam and Darrin and Larry and Louise all trade places. Dr. Bombay is called in to fix the problem. Other episodes include ""Darrin Goes Ape"", ""Money Happy Returns"", Sam's Psychic Pslip"", and ""Samantha's Magic Mirror"". In the later episode she tries to boast Esmeralda's confidence by helping her with her former boyfriend so each time she looks in the mirror she sees a gorgeous woman.

The majority of people who are Bewitched fans say out of the Dick Sargent years, that Season 7 is their favorite season with him. It is also one of my favorite seasons too. The Salem trip and the Christmas episode are some of the best that the show offered in it's 8 season run. So Bewitched fans get ready for Season 7 on February 3, 2009.

Note:  During the hiatus period of season 6 & season 7 a fire destroyed the set of kitchen, so William Asher producer of the show and Elizabeth's husband at that time decided to take the show to film many scenes in Salem. The entire cast and crew were there and I think that's why everyone is so anxious for this special season.",1228694400,44,2739,4.554878048780488

Its VERY cool that I can now watch this with my own 9-year-old daughter and know that she loves it too.  Its not a laugh-a-minute series-like most great comedies it has a lot of heart mixed with the comedy.  But when it is hilarious.  This season wasn't the best as it was winding down but is still an absolute must-see for the 5-part Salem trip which had some funny bits.  And there is an episode with the hilarious Uncle Arthur that I promise would make you laugh.  My kids and I still laugh even after seeing it many times now (they love the skeleton in the closet).

3691042,4,B001LRTT30,"Season 7 is sort of bittersweet for me personally, because it represents the last good year of the show & the end of what was a mostly ""magical"" run for this popular series.

Of course, the show was still showing signs of age--most notably the repeating of familiar themes we've seen performed in earlier seasons--i.e., an old admirer of Samantha's turning himself into a dog or the last episode of year 7 which redoes a plot that was done near the end of season 1. This time, instead of Samantha convincing Gladys Kravitz she has magical powers, it's Mother Stephens who believes she has been given the gift.

But--even with all the rehashing of old ideas--there were some new twists added to the show--most notably at the beginning of the year with the whole ""Salem Saga.""

And, I have to add--watching the show in its chronological order--that by Season 7, I have adjusted to Dick Sargent as Darrin. He's still no Dick York, but his presence doesn't seem to bother me as much as it did in Season 6 & maybe Sargent's best performance as ""Derwood"" came in the episode ""Samantha's Old Man"" where Endora ages him & Sam has to pass him off as Darrin's grandfather.

But--as I eluded to in my subject line--this will be my final season of ""Bewitched"", because as much as I love the show, I do my best to pretend year 8 never happened & judging by her performance during Season 8, Elizabeth Montgomery was clearly wishing she was doing something else besides playing Samantha Stephens.

So--as far as I'm concerned--little Adam was completely mortal and Darrin and Samantha faded off into the sunset after the last episode of year 7 & I hope I don't offend anyone who does enjoy year 8 of ""Bewitched""--these are just my own personal feelings.

It was a mostly great seven year ride. Thanks for the laughs and memories Elizabeth, Dick York, Agnes Moorehead, David White, George Tobias, and yes, even you Dick Sargent.",1394236800,,1912,4.675595238095238

3691055,5,B001LRTT30,"Do you prefer to see your favorite show's characters act out what you think could be real life, or do you prefer to see them as human beings, performing as actors on a stage? This may make a huge difference in whether you like season 7 or not.

I love this season, more than all the rest. Let me explain: I used to own all 8 seasons, but I sold all them because of unemployment, at the time. I missed the show very much, but I decided to buy just one season, this time. This is the one I chose.

Season 8 goes too far. Elisabeth Montgomery is burned out on the character she portrays, and it somewhat ruins it for me. She was sick of playing Samantha!!!

She wasn't yet to that point in season 7. Elizabeth Montgomery still loved playing the character, Samantha. You will see it in all these episodes.

So what if they had a different Daren? Rosanne said it best, in one of her episodes, when the Conner family (with new actress playing Becky) is watching Bewitched with new Daren: It was a hit TV show, and they could get away with it. Besides, they replaced Gladys Cravitz and Louis Tate in season 3. They also changed Daren's dad 2 or 3 times, didn't they? I think it adds to the fun!

I love this season because it finally shows Samantha up to date with other woman, at that time, who were more independent. She's not the backwards 50s woman needed to make us accept a woman who has powers over a male (her witchcraft), which we saw in the first few seasons. Think about it. She is a 70s woman, now. She very much loves her husband and children, and will do anything for them, but she is woman and hear her roar. Get used to it. She will not be walked upon, ever again from this point!",1374278400,5,1689,4.200617283950617

3691088,4,B001LRTT30,"""Bewitched"" was my favorite show in its day.  I've thoroughly enjoyed picking up all of the DVD releases through the seventh season.  The eight-episode arc in old Salem was a creative way to thread episodes together.  ""Samantha's Hot Bed Warmer"" is great classic comedy as the enchanted bed warmer keeps following Sam around.  I thought ""Samantha's Old Man"" was quite touching, showing issues about aging and the joys of growing old together with one you love.  ""Sister of the Heart"" tackled the issue of racism in a very sweet way, one to which children can relate.  Imogene Coca was a favorite of mine, so it's a particular delight for me to see her as Mary the tooth fairy.  ""Samantha & the Troll"" has just a little bawdy flavor, enough to raise a smile without offending.  Alice Ghostly is back as Esmerelda and complicates things on ""Samantha's Magic Mirror.""  ""Samantha & the Magic Doll"" had me laughing out loud as Darrin's mother is suddenly persuaded that she has magic powers.  This seventh year of the series is another sweet one, well worth replaying from time to time.  Enjoy!",1248134400,,1089,4.770053475935829

3691091,5,B001LRTT30,"""Bewitched"" continued to air on ABC during the 1970-1971 TV season, but the magic that made this show so special started to disappear. The series fell out of the top 25 rated shows that year, and registered only a platry 15.4 Nielsen Rating, meaning the show was hanging on just because the producers wanted to make enough episodes to strip in syndication. The series' first 2 years were never shown in early syndication deals, so it was important the show made enough color episodes to run on local tv stations. It's obvious everyone associated with ""Bewitched"" this year was trying their best to make the show work, but the series was dying. Scripts were retreaded plots from previous years, ideas were no longer original, and the actors were bored. This was also the year ""Bewitched"" began its ""Salem Saga"", as many shows were filmed on location. This was due because a serious fire damaged the ""Bewitched"" set as well as many dressing rooms in Los Angeles. These Salem shows were never my favorite, and I was glad when they finally returned the action to Samantha's house.
 There are a few high points this year, notably the ""Sisters at Heart"" episode, where Tabitha befriends a black girl. This eipisode won the Govenor General Award at The Emmy ceremony that year. Another good episode is ""Samanth'a Old Man"", where Endora turns Darren into an old man, and ultimately Samantha shows what she would look like, herself, when she would get old.
 28 episodes are included in this boxset and are in pristine condition.",1238976000,2,1519,4.816091954022989
3691092,5,B001LRTT30,"In this season's magical mayhem we find Sam and Darrin headed for Salem Massachusetts.  The continuing mishaps that befall them make for a fun trip. We find that Sam's family follow's them. So does Darrins boss Larry Tate. Samatha has to deal with Sarina and bed pans and even Paul Revere. When the family returns to Morning Glory Circle, we find more fun. A retelling of the warlock as a dog story. And Darrin as an old man who ends up the love match of Louise Tate's mom. Dick Sargent is in top form as Samantha's husband tis season. He and Elizabeth Montgomery are starting to click and flow as a team. It also helps with the directing of Willaim Asher. Also included is the best Christmas episode of the entire series. Tabatha and her best friend want to be sisters,and the wishing gets out of hand. The Tooth Fairy has an extended stay at the Stephens'. Great guest appearnces fill this season, with the likes of Imogene Coca, Bert Convy, Alic Ghostley,Ceasar Romero,and Tom Bosley. Paul Lynde also returns with silly one liners. His uncle Arthur brings a special nostalgic charm to this series. Bewitched brought new life to the old series in this season. They recaptured the old ""magic"" in season 7. It is a must have for any fan.",1238716800,3,1237,4.572072072072072
3691102,3,B001LRTT30,"By this season, the premise of Bewitched had started to wear thin. Almost every episode could be predicted: Endora pops in, Darrin makes a nasty comment, Larry is on edge about some critical new client, etc. Still, the Salem episodes were fun.

The video quality isn't as good as the earlier seasons--not sure whether that's the original or the transfer.

Also, when I went to watch one of the final three episodes, a two-minute mini-movie played in Spanish as part of the DVD. It couldn't be skipped over. I'm not sure if it's a mistake or exactly what it was. Just to be sure I wasn't going insane, I popped the disc back in and sure enough it was still there.",1238112000,2,662,4.462809917355372
3691103,5,B001LRTT30,I've always loved watching Bewitched and now that I have the DVD's I can keep watching them over and over. So glad that the old comedy shows are on a permanent way to keep them. Enjoy them!,1237766400,,189,4.135135135135135
3691104,3,B001LRTT30,"All the great comedies have their day, and yes, they do have their bad ones right? No Aunt Clara (Marion Lorne), No real Darrin Stephens and of course no Alice Pearce (Gladys Kravitz). No offense to fans of the series, but when York died, the series should have died with it. Sargent is the epitomy of wooden, or should I say, robotic acting. I have no really good things to say about him, he just does not mesh well with Montgomery, and I really could care less when Endora whacks him with a spell!  Sometimes I wish he would stay cursed and never to return!

 The original loveable Darrin, (York) was so funny, whacky, and so believable with his relationship with Montgomery, it's hard to just let that go and believe that Sargent just magically became her new husband. It's something about watching York and Montgomery mesh so well on screen--- but when Sargent comes on, I'm just like ""blah"", whatever.

 William Asher certainly had his work cut out for him, and he obviously ran out of ideas as this collection as there are only 28 episodes compared to the 35+ for the first few seasons. Season 7 kicks off with an unusual zealous eight-part story series involving Samantha and Darrin visiting Salem Massachusetts. It was a nice change of pace from that standpoint, and yes there are still some very funny moments especially when Sabrina gets back into the mix, but none of the funnier moments ever involve Sargent (cough cough).  Only Montgomery saves the series once again. The new environment of being in Salem for the first 8 episodes gives the series some serious visual variation from the norm of them being couped up in their home from show to show.

One episode touches the edge of racism and is actually considered one of Montgomery's favorite episodes. I do give hats off to the theme considering when this was first shown, and some will really dig it from that aspect. It involves one of Darrin's clients turns out to be a bigot who thinks Darrin has a black child (assume adopted), Sam eventually puts a spell on the racist so that now sees everyone as black including Larry Tate, Sam and Darrin and even sees himself in the mirror as black. It was an interesting show, and I do appreicate the them considering all the racism that was going on in the world at the time and I believe it was shortly after the assasination of Martin Luther Jr.

 As always, the lack of no Aunt Clara or the real Gladys Kravitz makes Season 7 all that more depressing. Thankfully it's not all a loss as we still got (David White) Larry Tate and (Endora) Agnes Moorehead still as the helm of the series and a growing up (Erin Murphy) Tabitha is still a welcome piece to the series. One thing I do appreciate is the improvement in the special effects, each season it just looks better to see the action on-screen and Asher is getting that down brilliantly.

All in all, there is really nothing really supremely memorable about this season. I did like some of the episodes, but fans will noticed, much of the stories from the first few seasons are back. Not saying it's a bad thing, but Asher is obviously running out of ideas bringing back stories from past shows.

Montgomery still pulls off being the star of the show and she still is a genius when she plays her half-witted cousin Sabrina.  Recycled stories, no loveable Darrin, no Aunt Clara, no Uncle Arthur. Fans of the series will buy this series just to fullfill their need to complete the series until we see Season 8. But I think in the end, the only ones you'll want to watch are the ones where York was there to enjoy, not Sargent.",1237766400,13,3588,4.537151702786378

Now, that they have the last season they are kind of sad it's over.  They have gone thru all of the seasons at least twice.  It's so fun to watch them when they recognize current actors in their younger years and start naming off what they play in.

I highly recommend this for anyone who would like to have their childern watch cleaner purer series like this.",1237766400,3,496,4.3478260869565215
