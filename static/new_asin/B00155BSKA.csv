8384392,5,B00155BSKA,Great series. My daughter loves it and she is learning a lot of medical stuff. It says from 2-5 and she is almost 5. I think a 2 year old wouldn't understand some of it but the animation of clay figures is great. Highly recommend for little french speakers!,1427500800,,257,4.26530612244898
