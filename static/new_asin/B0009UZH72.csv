8135996,5,B0009UZH72,"When I saw this movie I couldn't believe all the women (Evangelina Elizondo, Rosario Granados, etc) had the same haircut, short and slightly wavy, higher in the front with a bang falling on one side of the forehead. I would not dare to say it was the same color, because being a black and white movie, I don't know how many shades of brown look black on the screen. Might have been a very popular hairstyle back in 1954.
The movie is very good and Eduardo Fajardo is the object of the affection of both women, Ms. Elizondo, who is as devilish as naive, comes up with some tricks to get rid of her rival, Ms. Granados.
They supposed to be very good friends, but in one occasion, Elizondo asks Granados to get out of the car, which is close to a cliff, to get some flowers (and to my amazement Granados obeys blindly), so Elizondo turns the car on and pushes it to run her over and kill her!
It is a fantastic movie! Highly enjoyable by Ms Elizondo fans than who are not yet. Give it a chance, you'll be surprised!",1316649600,,1012,4.248704663212435
