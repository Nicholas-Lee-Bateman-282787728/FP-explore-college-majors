though understandably lacks the detail and nuances but effective. lets be fair how do you film two new primary colours? well worth watching.
if film students, on a low budget can do this in the seventies why isn't it being made now? a job for Arronovsky or Gilliam or a joint venture.
wouldnt that be something!",1448236800,,454,4.6875

8110749,3,B000EJVXI0,"This student film gets a lot of critique for being a failed effort. But adapting the book ""A Voyage To Arcturus"" is a sure-fire failiure no matter what resources you have. I give it thumbs up for sheer audacity and vision. And I don't mind the primitive costumes or the sometimes clunky stop-motion effects (which are also sometimes very well done). The only downside is the confused narrative, which is fine if you've read the novel. If you haven't, it'll be impossible to keep up with the story. For example, you might not realize that the main character actually dies just before the story ends. The book is surreal, but you never get lost in it, mainly due to lots of expository dialogue, which in this film is supplanted with visuals, which due to their very symbolic and stylized nature probably only confuse.
Still, this film is worth seeing just because of the very rare beast it is. This is made by a filmmaker with a single, laser-focused vision, showing that even ""impossible"" subjects ought to be attempted. It's very refresing compared to the assemble-line high-budget productions churned out by the pro studios today.",1386806400,,1131,4.835051546391752
8110750,1,B000EJVXI0,"Actually it's amusing to watch this as an example of how bad a film can be. It was an impossible project to start with - filming one of the major fantasy/sci fi works of the 20th century on a shoestring. So don't look for production values - it's in B&W, and they didn't have enough film for retakes so if the actors got it wrong it stays. And the acting is appalling. Krag (massive, bullying, hearty) comes on with a melodramtic BWA-HA-HA-HA and stays like that.  The dialogue is stilted. You have to imagine the body changes (one grows new organs on Tormance!) because they don't happen. Oh dear. But please - read the book!",1364515200,,626,4.443478260869565
8110751,4,B000EJVXI0,"Bill Holloway's film Voyage to Arcturus is a commendable effort to tackle an immense undertaking: the filming of  David Linsay's science fiction epic, a philosophical and highly complex work. Also commendable are Holloway's vision, courage and tenaciousness. The budget was beneath shoe-string with the actors assembled from a small college campus in the 1970's. The fliming was more or less ""first take"" and the actors were unable to adjust their own performance, a limitation that is compensated by the actors' gusto and dedication - they were working, at best, for food while they doubled as roadies, gaffers, and everything else in the production short of the director himself. But it is just this creative spirit of the director and the participants that lends the film its vitality.

The film should not only be watched, but be studied by all young filmmakers who have the courage to experiment and risk filming a work as complex as ""The Voyage"". And who can appreciate the low-low-budget decisions and learn from the director's choices in attempting to solve the hundreds of problems in realizing such a project. There are many super moments - the director portrays many of the essential scenes in a beautifully metaphoric form -and there are, naturally, a number of weaknesses and deficits. (The animation and stunts, for instance, are hamstrung by the restrictions of budget and the pre-digital era.) So the viewer searching solely for a Hollywood extravaganza al Lord of the Rings will need to watch the film through different spectacles.  It is as a student production to be enjoyed, and low-budget directors of films can learn a lot from the successes and short-comings of the film.",1270339200,3,1694,5.086330935251799
8110752,3,B000EJVXI0,"I read this book because C. S. Lewis like certain features of it. Lewis liked how Lindsey used the environment to set the atmosphere or ambience of the vignettes of the story. It wasn't my cup of tea. The protagonist encountered various beings whose philosophies differed wildly on this planet that was orbiting Arcturus. The book was somewhat violent. Most of the beings died horrible deaths. The protagonist Maskill caused or was responsible for all the deaths. I did not understand the ending all that well. Some of the other reviews read that they were surprised by it. I didn't understand why it was surprising.

The prose was fairly straight forward. The description of the surroundings was imaginative. The plot was plodding. The first murder was surprising, but after that I thought it was fairly predictable who was going to die. The book was an interesting,  but not particularly enjoyable read. Perhaps, if I knew the  philosophies he was addressing, I would have enjoyed it more.",1216684800,,991,4.957831325301205
8110753,1,B000EJVXI0,"I bought this DVD to my great disappointment. Even with allowances for a non-existent budget, it doesn't cut it. Remember, cinematographer Aurthur Eddison did Frankenstein in 1936 and Casablanca in 1942, so one might have expected some good lenswork by 1970s. But no, this is the Zapruder film of moviemaking. The notion that CGI wasn't around is irrelevant. If you've seen a Christopher Bruce ballet, you'd understand how a stage is enough. Remember, this was also the era of Midnight Cowboy and Easy Rider (1969): films shot in cemeteries and coffee shops. There were plenty of film chops out there to learn from and budget wasn't the problem.

This 1971 Antioch College production (supported by the National Endowment for the Arts) featured a denervated screenplay (converted to a Haight-Ashbury style), pre-school Claymation-like creatures (unnecessary), infantile lenswork, and crassly misinterpreted over-the-top direction. The actors did the best they could, but no one really had grip. If that seems harsh, buy it and decide. Seems like it needed to get done by final exam time.

I am fascinated by Lindsay's wonderful book, but this film dampens rather than enhances that delight.",1203811200,6,1189,5.285714285714286
8110754,5,B000EJVXI0,"Lindsay's book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Voyage-to-Arcturus/dp/0575074833/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Voyage to Arcturus</a>, spawns odd loyalties but strong ones. The 1920 story carries the reader through a shifting landscape of moral absolutes and ambiguities, with fantastical changes of terrain and even body at every step. I would have thought that making the movie would require a huge budget and eye-popping effects - but I'm happy to say that I would have been wrong.

This student work never even tries to emulate the fantasy elements of the original. Instead, it focuses on what truly matters: the personalities and personal transformations of the characters, especially the main character Maskull. A lot had to be skipped or simplified in bringing this complex book to the screen, but I feel that the film team made good choices in what to keep and how.

It really helps to know the book before coming to this movie. That will help the viewer through some of the obscure moments (i.e., most of them), and give the viewer a chance to fill in with imagination what lacks in the austere scenery and effects. Even the black-and-white filming works well, especially when different color casts help the viewer identify changes across the strange world of Tormance.

It seems a little odd to realize that this 1970 artifact, with definite hippie-era influences, lies almost as close to the story's 1920 origin as to the current day. That just adds to its charm, though. Others might have trouble enjoying it, but I recommend this little gem to anyone already a fan of Lindsay's baffling book.

8110755,5,B000EJVXI0,"Despite its fantastic imagery & overall power, David Lindsay's classic novel has always been considered unfilmable -- how do you even begin to portray two new primary colors, for example? More than that, how do you convey the ongoing symbolic, philosophical argument embodied by the various characters, and make it understandable to a mass audience? It seems impossible ...

And yet, here's a valiant attempt from 35 years ago, seemingly little more than a student film, which succeeds far more often than it fails. The budget is miniscule, the special effects are simple even for those times (such as the depiction of the shrowk) ... and yet, and yet ...

What matters in making such a film is capturing & conveying the vision of the story, not how much money is available. Indeed, a sufficent budget might well have been a detriment, as would the existence of CGI. The filmmaker can't fall back on either of those resources, so he concentrates on making the story & its philosophical underpinnings as vivid & gripping as possible. And for the most part, it works!

Some key scenes are truncated or eliminated because of time constraints; others are transformed outwardly, while still retaining their essence. But the look & feel is just right. The climactic vision of the book may be too complex to convey properly onscreen, but the filmmaker substitutes a simpler, more symbolic image which captures its essential truth.

I'm sure that when the film was made has much to do with its many strengths. Coming out of the 1960s, an era far more suited to & comfortable with visionary experience, the film takes the audience's receptivity to symbolism & the shattering of one paradigm after another for granted, and that works in its favor. A reading of the book before viewing is vital, I think. But the film is an honorable, bold, often compelling realization of the book.

Highly recommended!",1140739200,19,1892,4.9
