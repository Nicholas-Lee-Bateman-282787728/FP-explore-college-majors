7739608,5,B01ERZG5UW,"A little bit of DEATH WISH, a little bit of FALLING DOWN, but also very funny at times. Terrific thriller with a great lead performance from Bill Oberst Jr., who has played a lot of bad guys and monsters in movies and on TV shows like CRIMINAL MINDS. Veteran Armand Assante is out of control, in a good way, as an unhinged cop who is investigating Bill's murders (the lead character's name is Bill).

Once it got past the half way point, I stopped predicting where it was going. The ending was a complete surprise.

Great looking film with a lot of cool actors, and a special mention goes to the soundtrack, which I loved. If there's a special DVD coming out, I'll be getting it.",1465171200,2,679,4.380952380952381

Interesting premise then the pace feels slower and more tortuous than sitting through an annual corporate year-end review conference call on a Friday afternoon. This is a film about people who are supposed to be quirky and interesting - yet never manages to be quirky or interesting itself.

Bill Oberst was good; I felt embarrassed for poor Armande Assante - Lo, how the mighty have fallen! - his entire, sad time on screen. But one 'character' actor in particular - the lead's best friend - should be singled out for the worst scenery-chomping, ham-fisted, Yosemite Sam, telegraphed student film emoting I have been unfortunate enough to wince through in quite some time.

Please: do yourself a favor. Low budget or studio machine, spend your time seeing a film that's actually clever, dark, funny, directed with a modicum of competence, written with double entendres that do not announce their impending presence from two blocks away, and well-cast.

7739705,4,B01ERZG5UW,"Melbourne born, now LA based, independent filmmaker Mark Savage delivers a very solid effort with his latest feature as a co-writer and director, STRESSED TO KILL. A thriller with a darkly comic edge, the film stars Daytime Emmy winner Bill Oberst Jr. as a highly strung everyman who, after suffering a serious heart attack, takes his doctor's advice to eliminate the stressors in his life a bit too literally (hasn't every film buff wanted to murder an inconsiderate cinemagoer who refuses to stop talking or gawking at their mobile phone during a movie?).

Oberst Jr. really delivers a great performance, and has very unique looks that make him appear like a cross between Peter Weller and Reggie Nalder, and he gets strong support from the great Armand Assante, as a cop who harbors some pretty dark and twisted impulses of his own.

Not all of STRESSED TO KILL works, but the odd bumps in its road are more than compensated for by its high points and overall impact. Savage composes some great shots, and the film delivers a couple of truly amazing sequences during its second half - one when Assante reveals the true nature of his character and psyche, and a climax inside a small cluttered apartment that is terrifically staged and played out, and unlike so many modern films it wraps itself up very nicely and satisfyingly.",1469750400,2,1330,4.8034934497816595
7739706,5,B01ERZG5UW,"If you enjoy edgy cinema and are tired of the usual Hollywood boilerplate and pandering commerciality, the relentless rehashing of quotidian themes ( how many more superhero films can you stomach?)  then 'Stressed to Kill' should be at the top of your bucket list. Gritty and dramatic, but never self consciously serious, this remarkable new effort by indie cult director Mark Savage  derives it's edgy sensibility from an almost sublime tone of underlying farce, which calls to mind films like the Cohen Brothers 'The Man Who Wasn't There', or even the iconic 'Dr. Strangelove'. ( Test audiences who saw 'The Man Who Wasn't There' were equally divided as to whether the film was straight drama versus film noir sendup). The effect on the critical viewer, never easy to achieve in the visual arts, is mostly subconscious: We are certain that the protagonists take themselves seriously, but we can never be sure that Savage himself does. It's this kind of festering  psychological duality that Savage nurtures and sustains throughout this unpretentious little indie newcomer that gives his film it's energy, momentum and impish charm. With sterling performances by Armand Asante as an eccentric cop and Bill Oberst Jr. as a the put upon everyman. I thoroughly enjoyed the film.",1468800000,,1276,5.125

So Bill begins killing the people who upset him. His weapon: poison darts. Pretty soon, Bills blood pressure drops and he begins to enjoy life again, but complicating his new lease on life is a cop (Armand Assante) who begins to close in on Bill after he connects him with the Dartman killings sweeping the city.

Reminiscent of Death Wish, Stressed to Kill has a vigilante justice plot with a twist. Though Bill seeks out some criminals, he also kills merely annoying or inconsiderate people. As he eliminates them one by one, he does so content in the belief that hes following his cardiologists orders. The film works as an action drama as well as a clever commentary on modern-day stress, which most viewers can relate to. If the film exaggerates the remedy for stress for dramatic effect, it highlights the fact that there is a great deal of pent-up, seething rage among us.

Two very strong leading men anchor this through its various twists and turns, and anyone who's wanted to slug someone texting during a movie should be able to sympathize a bit with our stressed-out antihero. Bonus points for those really cool credits, too.",1466812800,,456,4.6419753086419755
7739711,5,B01ERZG5UW,"Checked this movie out because I'm a fan of Bill Oberst Jr. He is an awesome actor. But I do admit he has been in some low budget messes. This is not one of them! It's indy and I expect the budget was not that of a big hollywood movie but it really doesn't show. Production quality was good, lighting & sound were decent and surprisingly the actors were all pretty good! Usually indy thrillers spend their budget on a couple big stars and the rest are..... well to be nice not as good quality. This was different though. I of course feel Bill was the stand out but the other actors who played his best friend and the cop who was after him carried their weight. Even the smaller roles were filled with actors of quality. That made all the difference in the world for me!

As someone else stated it is more of a black comedy then a thriller. I think we can all relate to Bill on some level. He does what we wish we could do. There were a lot of ""hell yeah"" moments when he took someone down. I thoroughly enjoyed this flick from beginning to end and more then likely will watch it again. May have to buy the DVD for the collection.",1466726400,,1129,4.155251141552512

With the help of a friend, Bill reduces his stress with poisonous blow darts. Yup.  No heads exploding. Detective Paul Jordon (Armand Assante) a bit of a vigilante himself, tails the two.

Killing with a blowgun is about as exciting as a Vulcan nerve pinch. Bill was a boring character who never really looked stressed, he would just hold it in.

Stressed to Kill features a great script, stellar score & cinematography, and wonderful performances throughout. The supporting cast are top notch and Armand Assante is delightfully demented, but the real treat here is Bill Oberst Jr. as a tormented Everyman who seeks catharsis at any cost. Their late night excursion to the dark underbelly of the city is one for the history books! Lean & mean filmmaking powered by character-driven action, delivered with style & wit without being gratuitously flashy.

7739722,4,B01ERZG5UW,"I've been a long time Bill Oberst Jr. fan.  Some of his movies, like this one, aren't what I'd call 'A+', but not because of any inability on Bill's part.  Bill, as always, give nothing less than a stellar performance.

This one started out a bit slow, but did finally pick up.  All of that being said, I did end up liking this one very much.  Bill's character is totally believable.  He does what I am sure many of us think about doing sometimes.  Armand Assante was rather difficult, for me, to watch.  His performance seemed a bit stilted, and fumbling.

The story, I feel, was well written, and overall was very well done.  Over all, I did enjoy the movie, especially towards the end, wherein Bill's character was able to frame someone else for the murder.  I was actually cheering Bill's character on, hoping against hope that he would get away with all of it.

All in all, I would highly recommend this movie.",1465603200,3,915,4.4787878787878785
7739723,5,B01ERZG5UW,"Stressed to Kill is a highly entertaining indy thriller/dark comedy.  Elements of the plot are reminiscent of Falling Down crossed with Strangers on a Train.  Bill Oberst Jr. plays Bill (the role he was born to play!) a stressed out every man who suffers a heart attack and decides to eliminate the causes of his stress . . . permanently.

Marshal Hilton is Stan, Bill's best friend turned enabler, and turns in a terrific supporting performance.  I had not heard of HIlton before this film, but I'm now a fan.  The more well-known Armand Assante plays the off-his-rocker cop trying to track down Bill. Assante delivers a great, over-the-top performance that reminded me of late career, ""I don't give a crap"" Marlon Brando -- and to be clear I mean that as a big compliment!

Bill Oberst Jr. is a terrific leading man, and his journey throughout the film is mesmerizing.  I thought I was going into ""just"" an independent thriller, but at times Stressed to Kill is absolutely hysterical.  I practically busted my gut in the scene where Bill kills a fat lady in the elevator with a blow dart; trust me, it is worth the rental itself!  The tone shifts swiftly at times, for example I was rolling on the floor as Bill dresses up as a little old lady to kill a target at an AA meeting.  The sight of Bill dressing up like Irene Ryan from the Beverly Hillbillies had me in stitches . . . but the haunted reaction of Bill and Stan after the murder, a cross between intoxicated satisfaction and ""can you believe we did it"" horror is top-notch acting, award material stuff.

Stressed to Kill is one to check out for sure!

Armand Assante has always been one my fave actors so he was a big draw but I had a hard time understanding what he was saying. Maybe his mumbling was on purpose, I don't know.

7739758,4,B01ERZG5UW,"On Mark Savage's Stressed to Kill. Mark is a very important figure in Australian Cinema scene- huge influence on the New Gen - many of us having worked with him or collaborated with him over the years. Especially back in the day. From the new Indy genre crew around the Melbourne Underground Film Festival and other circles. I met him at the Super 8 film Group in around 1984 and became a follower of his enthusiasm and spirit for Indy cinema - working mostly on Super 8 back then. He was like 100 times more Dynamic and Passionate about Cinema than any Film School. We worked on some early projects together. His new feature is Stressed to Kill with two Big Names in tow - Bill Oberst Jr. and Armand Assante and shot in Florida. I really loved it to be honest - one of Mark's most accomplished and realized films - with echoes of 70's DePalma and other genre flicks of that era. The main character's misanthropy is strong and dark like Mark's own, the psychopathology of the age is shown in it's vicissitudes and the film has a great and mixed bag of nutty characters to entertain and intrigue it's 90 minute plot. It's lots of fun. Armand Assante is a real coup - and was really great as the Bent cop - showing his skills and presence have not faded. Nice and Menacing. Bill Oberst Jr is also very strong and is like Mark a bit in looks and presence - many directors cast a lead who is a bit like them. Oberst dominates the picture and make sit his own Enjoyed the wicked plot of Revenge - and it was well shot by long time Mark collaborator David Richardson. Out now in the US.
