8077366,3,B000AAUP32,"Magnus Edkvist (Bjorn Kjellman), a 35-year-old insurance man with a lovely wife and daughter, is not at all interested in attending his high school class reunion. After all, it's being organized by the snotty popular types, and he might run into that jerk Tommy who used to bully people with his gang. Magnus doesn't relish the idea of being put back in his ""nerdy loser"" place by his former classmates. On the other hand, Hillevi, the black girl who was his first love, just might be there too, even though she ran away from school 20 years ago and Magnus refused to go with her. This is somewhat familiar territory, both for high school graduates of any country and filmgoers; the writing-directing team of Mans Herngren and Hannes Holm have concocted a somewhat formulaic tale set in 2002 Sweden, with plenty of awkwardness and anguish amid the laughs. But it's a decent film, and there's a terrific cameo by veteran Swedish actress Ingrid Luterkart (born in 1910, she was in the same drama class with Ingrid Bergman in the 1930s!) as the graduates' long retired teacher, who seems dotty and doddering but turns out to be a bit more sly and alert than she appears.",1209686400,,1167,4.697560975609756
