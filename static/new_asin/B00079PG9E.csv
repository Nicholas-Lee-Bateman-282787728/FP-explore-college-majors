8046338,5,B00079PG9E,"Although there is no narration, the color films are just excellent!! You feel as if you've gone back in time. The title frames help orient you to the film that follows. I highly recommend this--especially to anyone who is too young to have seen the fair in person!--and have ordered the other 3 volumes to complete my set.",1214265600,,322,4.568965517241379
8046339,5,B00079PG9E,"Back the dawn of the 20th Century, New York was home to several World's Fairs. The one on this dvd set, Futurama, is pretty interesting. You get to see what people back then thought would happen in our future. They got it all wrong - where the heck is my flying car - but that doesn't mean it isn't fun to watch. I also liked seeing the way people dressed and talked from a historical perspective and the street scenes of old new york are fascinating. It's amazing how well preserved some of these films are.",1152835200,,508,4.302083333333333
