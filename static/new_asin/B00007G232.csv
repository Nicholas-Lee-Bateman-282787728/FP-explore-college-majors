1808542,3,B00007G232,"This movie could had been very good but some things in it spoil this beautiful fairy tale.  I like The Spring Witch, she was sometime going overboard with her acting but she was the best season that I like in the movie, the atmosphere that they create for the Spring was great, it was like magical and sometime weird, if not beautiful and creepy at the same time, like The Spring Witch was overly nice, got a beautiful little cozy home but sometime she got mad and it was kind of scary and like Gerda said if she get back into the house The Spring Witch won't let her come out, that was scary to wonder if the Spring Witch will force her to come back into the house.  The Summer Princess was Beautiful and she got a gorgeous Palace but I didn't think she fit in this fairy tale, I would like more something like the Spring atmosphere but The Summer could not had been worst then the Autumn! I hate that part, it didn't fit at all and almost spoil all the movie!  The Robber Girl got so much on my nerve and I was glad that Gerda push her, she deserve it!  Why the sister of the Snow Queen was a robber?  Autumn Robber, that didn't make much sense!  It's really ruin a good part of this beautiful Fairy Tale! The Snow Queen play by Bridget Fonda was Great, she was Uniquily Beautiful, got long white hair and icy blue eyes, it was a different beautiful look but the Snow Queen got to look like her season, I thought they made a wonderful job for her look, she do look like Beautifuly Icy!:)  Her acting was okay but not great like Miranda Richardson who play Snow White Step-Mother in the movie of the same name Snow White. Gerda act good, much better then the one who play Snow White in another Hallmark movie. Kai I find him harsh sometime, yeah he had to act rude when he was curse by the Snow Queen but before that I find him I don't know a bit harsh but act not that bad. The Polar Bear was great, he look so real!  He was scary but at the same time he got a soft heart! Like I said it could had been a Great movie if that would not be especially of The Autumn Robber and worst her daughter, The Robber Girl!  In this movie it got great speacial effect!  Overall it's a good movie!",1045180800,,2185,4.12
1808543,5,B00007G232,"I find that epic movies whether Hallmark or any kind sometimes end up being too cute or boring or just over the top for no reason. The Snow Queen was none of these things, starting out as a simple romance between two teens entering adulthood, (she's 17 he's 18) it slowly moves into the magical realms of the seasons as the main character, Gerda, attempts to save her first and only true love from the Snow Queen. The scenery is very lush and beautiful but the thing that truly makes this a fine epic movie is the acting, which is superb. All the characters hold their own weight and I would reccomend this movie to anyone who enjoys an engrossing tale which deals with temptaion, love, and loss, although I agree with the other poster who considers this for the 8 and up set, some of the darker themes may be a little ovewhelming for those younger then eight.",1043020800,9,860,4.415094339622642
1808544,5,B00007G232,I thought this movie was really good! I enjoyed the special affects and the sets! There were four seasons Spring Summer Fall and of couse winter! They all had a big village or cute little house! I really liked spring and summer because spring had a little house that was very welcoming. Summer however had a big palace. Fall was set like Roben Hood. Where Every body robbed people! I really loved this movie!,1039305600,10,408,4.527027027027027
1808604,2,B00007G232,"If the acting were a lot better, it might be mediocre (I'm looking at you, Robber Girl). And, since it's a Hallmark production, it's romantic to the point of being saccharine - maybe OK for a tween girls' slumber party, but that's about it.

According to IMDB, this was Bridget Fonda's last role before disappearing from acting. I'm not saying this actually killed her career, but it's something to think about.

1808612,5,B00007G232,"I don't understand why people hate this movie so much. My god it's not hard to follow. People understand: Kai is under the snow queens spell, it's like a love spell. And she shows a cold side because her heart is cold. When Kai sees the snow queen, he falls in love, it's a spell...  And other people say why does the snow queen kill Gerta's mother? It's obvious, she was alone, the snow queen is evil, so therefore killing is easy for her. And another thing, it wasn't poorly made at all, remember people this was 2002, the graphics back then aren't like now. And remember it's a movie aimed at a young audience so, there wouldn't be sex, what a few kisses, that's part of the fairytale.. The only thing I noticed, in the movie the snow queen has to kiss Kai 3 times, but the movie only shows two? That's the only thing I noticed that was left out. But this is still a great movie.. I saw this in 2002 on the tv, I liked it then and I like it now. Now I understand it better. So yes it's a great movie, I recommend it!

I believe this was Bridget Fonda's last film before an accident caused her retirement from acting. She's mesmerizing and beautiful in her role as ""The Snow Queen"". It's an absurdly campy flick at times but there's something really charming about how it all unfolds to a conclusion you won't expect to see coming. Very classic storytelling. I guess you can call it nostalgic but it's one of those feel good movies (it's a long one with two parts!) that pretty much the whole family can enjoy.

1808708,1,B00007G232,"This film deserves an award for one of the worst ever made. It is about two and a half hours too long and simply lacks a plot - it is an insult to the memory of Hans Christian Andersen. The acting was pretty awful as well. I did wonder whether the entire cast and crew were suffering from the effects of several illegal substances - perhaps driven to using them by the sheer banality of the plot (I use the term loosely). If you have not seen it my advice is to avoid it altogether. It is not one of those films that is ""so bad that it is good"", it is just bad.",1352592000,2,561,3.9298245614035086
1808709,5,B00007G232,"I just have to say, as some one that is utterly obsessed with this story and wrapped up in it. It was very well done. I know that most people view it as slow and it is a slow movie. But it could not have been done any better. Gerda travels through all the seasons to find her beloved Kai. Each season she meets, the enchanting spring lady, the summer princess with the dreams on the wall and the little robber girl of fall all were very beautifully done. I could not have asked for a better story line and something to bring my fantasy to life then this movie. MUCH better then the BBC version and any cartoon version out there. And the bear prince was a wonderful addition. I love it when he tells Kai ""If you disturb a sleeping bear then you get a smack!"" And also Rutker the talking reindeer. All of it was amazing. I watch this movie every few months and around Christmas time. Kai is right, there is nothing more perfect on this earth this a snowflake it is flawless and no two are alike.

I highly recommend this to anyone that wants to open up a new window to their child of a fairy tale that has been a much loved one for all ages. Even adults can enjoy this too. After all that's what Mr. Andersan wanted, fairy tales that both children and adults could love as one.",1341705600,,1275,4.161943319838056

1808716,5,B00007G232,"I apologize beforehand to all people who read this review because I have never read Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen."" Andersen was a wonderful writer of fairy tales, but I could never get into ""The Snow Queen."" However, this movie was enthralling from beginning to end.

Gerda lives with her father, an innkeeper, and does all the work her deceased mother would have done had she survived.  When Kai, a new employer, comes to work at the inn, he and Gerda gradually find themselves falling in love.  However, a seductive yet malevolent force, the Snow Queen, seeks to bring Kai under her evil sway.  When Kai falls victim to her icy and caressing call, Gerda embarks on a perelous quest to rescue him.  Before she can free her true love, she must face her own shortcomings and come to terms with her mother's death.  Will she succeed, or will the ruthless Snow Queen conquer all?

This movie was multi-layerd and beautifully portrayed.  I especially loved the fact that a young woman set out to rescue her love instead of the more traditional tale of a man rescuing a woman.  All the characters are complex, and even the Snow Queen is empathetic to a certain extent.  My favorite aspect of the movie was a subplot involving a polar bear that guards Kai in the Snow Queen's palace.

The acting in this movie is very good.  Bridget Fonda is chilling as the manipulative Snow Queen, and her seductive voice and cold laughter will chill you to the bone.  Chelsea Hobbs was magnificent as the heroine.  Please give this excellent film a chance.  God bless you all.

(Please look for my fantasy novel, Crimilia, published by Tate Publishing, which is scheduled to be released later this year.  Thank you).",1296259200,,1709,4.700336700336701

1808720,4,B00007G232,"I'm an adult who is still a sucker for and fascinated by faerie tales, especially when they are faithful to the origingal concept/intent of the story. I feel that for the most part, this filmed version of 'The Snow Queen' does a fine job of it. Contrary to many reviews, I enjoyed Bridget Fonda as the Snow Queen. She was cold, detatched and potentially cruel-as is the season that she embodies. All of the other actors were invested and talented, except the woman playing Summer, but more on that later.

What I love about this particular faerie tale is how it relates to the concept that love must endure all seasons and be tested harshly at every turn. This is a human truth and a morality tale that holds true through the time that has passed since this story's genesis. Gerda is tested by each of the seasons to retrieve her lost love, Kai, as he has been abducted by the Snow Queen. The movie is wonderful at personifying each season (except summer) as Gerda fights to rescue Kai. The imagery is lush and easy to get lost in.

Gerda begins with Spring. I loved the unyielding innocence of the lady of Spring. The actress that portrays her is remarkable. Then Gerda confronts the lady of Summer. I hated this part of the film and it is the ONLY reason that I gave the film four instead of five stars. The actress is horrid. She reduces a timeless tale to Disney Channel/empty Hollywood fare. (and after all, didn't those two forces destroy faerie tales in the first place?) It's the only part I cannot bring myself to watch again.

Gerda them moves on to Fall. I loved this bit. She was very Earthy almost Pagan. Wild and unrestrained. She is fearless and destroys the remnants of Summer with a delightful glee.

Then, the finale. I really dug the bit about Satan and the mirror. I felt that it exposed the vanity of each of the seasons. Wonderful. Yes, I agree that it could frighten young children, but it is essential to the plot. What should be more frightening to these parents (who have written reviews) is Hannah Montana. Shows like that kill the imagination and waste the time of too many young children. Do them a favor and rent or buy this film and also Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre.",1250121600,,2206,4.5075
1808721,4,B00007G232,"While I agree the story was heavily adapted for flighty modern tastes and there are some incredibly horrible dialogues sporadically put here and there that are searching for laughs rather than being inherently funny, it was overall a nice adaptation. It at least tried to keep close to the original tale and only adapted it in a similar spirit whenever possible.

SPOILERS

Kay(Kaye) is now Kai. They're also a few years older and don't start out as best friends (which was the original impetuous for Gerda's search). However at the end of the tale they realize they love each other anyway, so this I can quite easily forgive.

The Eternal Summer Witch becomes the Spring Witch, but the mothering tendency & brainwashing is still there. Really the only thing that changed about that scene from the original story was that she was rechristened as Spring.

The Princess looking for a prince to marry becomes the Summer Princess set on marrying Gerda off. It's a bit of a change, but the spirit of the original part of the story is kept. Quite frankly this scene is very much adapted for modern tastes and is obviously looking for laughs, but it wisely gives us a look at how air-headed & almost blindly idealistic the season actually is, which is something summer fanatics I think tend to forget.

The Robber Hag and her daughter the Robber Girl become an Autumn couplet who capture & keep Gerda along the same lines of the story. As for why they became Autumn, it's quite obvious in my mind. Gypsies, as the Robbers in the original story & this adaptation were portrayed, do a lot of harvesting after all. Also the cynical spirit that comes along with them matches growing pessimism of Autumn in contrast to the bubbly idealism of Summer. Also the gypsy defiance and celebration honors the harvest festivals where people would indulge themselves and play games with one another throwing society into a bit of a chaotic environment. Think of Mischief Night where modern teens go TPing and egging houses. Think of All Hallow's Eve being the one night of the year that people believed evil could break the natural laws that ruled them the rest of the year roam the land for a night. Think of La Dia de los Muertos where the dead are believed to come back to life for an evening and eat the food the family brought for them. Think of Saturnalia in Rome where masters pretended to be servants and the servants as masters. Scandinavia and Britain also held similar holiday revels in the form of Yuletide. Where do you think the concept of Halloween came from? Not from the Candy Companies--they only exploited it.

The adaptation, in my mind was all pretty close to the original plot or the spirit of it until they took out the Lord's Prayer bit that Gerda says to defeat the Snow Queen's army. However most adaptations do that so that's almost to be expected with our secularized society. However they kept the Christian Rose symbolism and changed the Lord's Prayer into Gerda's mother's magic brooch. This part of the adaptation pales in comparison to the original tale, but it attempts to adapt in a similar spirit. The only terribly corny part was the ""wake up"" sequence, but that I can close my eyes and ignore quite easily.

Also Gerda's mother dying and getting rid of Granny (replacing her with Minna was nice though) made me a little sad, but I thought what was done with that gave a more realistic feeling to the story. It also was a way to make Gerda the traditional ""quiet girl"" stereotype (with a realistic reason why she is that way) without upsetting the ultra-feminists in our secularized society.

Overall it was a better adaptation than the amazingly bad one that Fairy Tale Theater put on. I didn't expect quality from that, but after seeing something THAT bad, this was kinda nice.

Also, I don't know about your translation of the original tale, but mine goes back and forth between calling the Hobgoblin the devil and a hobgoblin. However I think the devil works best considering the Christian symbolism and parts in the original tale. It's a shame though that the adaptation didn't hold true to the original Christian part of the story, it would've balanced out and explained the Devil part nicely. However, we're dealing with a secularized society so it's not too surprising.

END SPOILERS

Also, I've read some other posts where reviewers go off on that it's not meant for children?!? Fairy tales are inherently seductive, bloody, violent, and full of this kind of stuff--the Snow Queen that HCA wrote is actually is a little more tame in comparison to some original folk tales. Consider for the fact that Hansel and Gretel push an old woman into an oven and roast her to death. Beauty and the Beast is the equivalent of wife beating. Each little pig--in the original story of the Three Little Pigs--dies and is eaten until the Wolf gets to the last one and can't blow down the brick house. But even he is turned into Wolf Stew by the last little pig. The Hare in the Hare and the Hedgehog is outsmarted by the Hedgehog (and his wife) and runs himself to death. In the original Cinderella, the father is still alive and doesn't care for his daughter, the stepsisters cut parts of their feet off to fit into the slipper, and the birds who befriended Cinderella peck the stepsisters blind in the end.

That is the legacy of our original folktales and myths: blood, violence, and gore. The fact that generations of children have been reading/hearing variations on these tales for centuries doesn't surprise me. Those things were a large part of life back then (and still are, no matter how much we try to avoid & deny it), and these stories actually gave a way to deal/introduce such things quite well. They also did so in a in a safer environment & probably provided a comforting effect to children who were already severely effected by them. The Devil is also a frequent visitor in fairy tales, and many characters in many stories go through periods of temptation from him.

So, seeing a man in red makeup portray the Devil, seeing Gerda attempting suicide (which was close enough and adapted along a similar line of self-sacrifice which the original tale drives home as a core theme of the story), and the multiple attempts of seduction and temptation for both Kai & Gerda are actually cornily fluffy compared to what original folklore contained for children.

What society has to recognize is that the real harm comes from editing these stories until there are no ""offensive parts"" left. At which point the innocence of the original stories looks trite and corny with nothing left to balance it out and the stories lose their true meaning and influence in society. What you learn from these stories is that in order for true innocence & goodness to exist, the darker side of human nature must threaten its very existence, otherwise it has no true meaning. The worst harm that can be done to a fairy tale is editing out the gory bits, however, I digress.

IMO, this movie is meant for kids & preteens--how could it not be? Also, for those who fear that seeing Gerda jumping off a bridge or a personification of the Devil will scar the kids for life, allow me to digress for a tiny bit: I watched Bugs Bunny get drunk on numerous occasions, and what was actually happening went right over my little head at the time. It was only upon revisiting the cartoons recently that I realized what I had actually seen.

So, if any of you still feel like censoring this and all other offensive bits in the sake of ""protecting the children"", just hire three monkeys, I'm sure they could help you quite easily.",1241136000,4,7614,4.666666666666667

1808731,2,B00007G232,"The Snow Queen is an ancient story from Northern Europe about a beautiful lady with a heart of ice who resides near the North Pole, and uses winter to take the lives of innocent human beings, and uses her beauty and charm to seduce innocent men.  Live action movies and cartoon versions of this story have been made in numerous decades in multiple languages.  One of the later ones is this 3 hour version by Hallmark Entertainment.  Taking place somewhere in Scandinavia; most likely Denmark, the setting is a small rural village in the mid 20th century.  A father loses his wife to winter, and raises his daughter at their hotel.  One day, he hires Kai, a young man, to help with labor around the hotel.  He and the daughter fall in love, but the Snow Queen steals Kai away.  The daughter sets forth on a journey across earth and the four seasons to find the lair of the Snow Queen to rescue Kai.

The movie's story is quite good and offers much promise.  But the movie drags too much; the dialogue is often muted, and the Snow Queen is somewhat wooden; not enough emotion.  The idea of a beautiful queen of ice is done much better in the Chronicles of Narnia than here, as Bridget Fonda does not do much talking at all.  The idea of the robbed girl having to travel across the spring, summer and autumn to find Kai is quite innovative and only possible by the crew of Hallmark, but again it was not done well.  The action scenes were somewhat fake, and most importantly, the snow in the winter scenes clearly looked like fake snow.  Overall, a good attempt but a bad result.",1160611200,,1576,4.430555555555555

So go on and enjoy it for what it is - a beautifully-told story with good (although not great) acting.

1808733,4,B00007G232,"Fans of fairy tales and fantasy will absolutely adore this new version of THE SNOW QUEEN, loosely based on the original Hans Christian Andersen tale but filled with a lot of new symbolism and romantic touches.  Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) lives with her widowed father in a luxury hotel, still mourning the mysterious death of her mother.  When the handsome Kai (Jeremy Guilbaut) is employed as the new bellboy, love begins to bloom, but when a beautiful, nameless woman arrives at the height of winter, Kai becomes infatuated and follows her into a world of numbing ice and snow.  Grief-stricken Gerda throws herself into a river and wakes up in the care of the Spring Witch (Jennifer Clement), but despite all her best efforts at brainwashing and derailing the quest, Gerda escapes her clutches, and must travel through the rest of the four seasons, all the way to edge of the world, to rescue Kai from the clutches of the woman Gerda calls the Snow Queen...

Although the original Andersen fairytale did not include the characters of the Autumn Queen or the Summer Princess, the entire ""Four Sisters"" idea is fantastic and emphasizes the amount of time Gerda is away from home.  The cycle of the seasons and the rhythms of the earth provide the core ideas in this treatment of THE SNOW QUEEN.  Bridget Fonda is mesmerising in the title role, a woman whose glacial beauty is enough to seduce any mortal man.  The amount of Jungian symbolism in this version is great to explore too.  The costume and set designs are mind-blowing and the entire film is flawless in terms of screenwriting and casting.  Highly-recommended.

1808749,3,B00007G232,"I bought this DVD because I enjoy the Hallmark productions of various fantasy tales, not because I was familiar with the original Hans Christian Anderson story. Therefore, I'm not equipped to judge it based on it's adherence to the original story but only as a bit of television entertainment.

The basic story is about how the Snow Queen wants to dominate all the seasons so that it is winter year-round. Part of what we see in the movie is how she attempts to do this and how the heroine attempts to stop her. The way in which the story unfolds in regards to this plot is where a lot of the entertainment value lies so I won't spoil it.

The main problem lies in the pacing of the story. The first hour, which is largely dedicated to establishing the characters and relationships between them, moves far too slowly. While I believe time dedicated to character development can be of great value, some of the scenes are unnecessary or unnecessarily long (such as the ice skating scene where pro skater doubles perform twirls and other manuevers real skaters would never bother with). The odd thing is that I believe the extra time spent showing us how the hero and heroine fall in love actually undermines the credibility of the passion they supposedly feel for each other rather than enhances it. The languid pace shows a slow build of affection rather than a rapid burn which might incite the heroine to face great danger on her love's behalf.

Unlike other reviewers who believed Bridget Fonda's portrayal of the snow queen didn't explain the hero's attraction to her, I simply concluded it wasn't her beauty or her behavior that drew him to her but simply magic. Nonetheless, I think that there should have been a clearer explanation of the ""mechanics"" behind what she was doing, particularly when she behaved so cruelly at times and still was able to hold those around her in her thrall. Perhaps such an explanation wouldn't have been necessary if she had been portrayed in a more sensual manner. However, I think that these family-oriented presentations seek to avoid too much sexually-driven content.

There are some beautiful scenes and the story has a satisfying ending but it seems disjointed at times and I could easily see some viewers growing bored waiting for the story to move along. The overall ""feel"" of the movie was also disrupted (for me personally) by the relatively modern music that was used at times. All in all, I think that the father and son producers (the Halmis), who have made a lot of these types of productions for Hallmark, dropped the ball on this one. They had a lot of good pieces but put them together wrong.",1121558400,23,2645,4.706263498920086

Two characters in this movie are in love and the snow queen tampers with that. So the movie is basically about a woman searching for her love. She goes through the seasons to do this. EAch place she has to go through is magnificent. The visual of each season is very appealing. Hallmark has a way of taking you to a different place with their fairy tales, and this movie is no exception to that.

On the down side: the begining of the movie is boring, and you start wondering what is this movie about. You also start hoping that its not another one of those old fashioned hallmark movies. Well it only drags in the begining of the movie...just to set the story up. After the snow queen steels her man, the movie is fantastic and exactly what you would expect from hallmark.

I think anyone under 10 may not understand the morals or the underlying messages presented in the story. I wasn't sure if I should buy this movie, I had never seen it but my best friend reccommended it to me so I followed through with her advice. The romances going on in the movie are fantastic and yeah the younger actors aren't going to be as great as Bridget Fonda but they're pretty damn good. I loved the ending, I wish they would have expanded more on the snow queen at the end. I love the way the snow queen is portrayed, she's wicked sometimes but she has a heart too. The special effects are amazing, and the costumes are fabulous!

What I didn't like about this movie:

*The 'devil' scene when satan is making the mirror. It makes no sense and should be removed, why would the devil make something and the season's accept it? The movie has more of a Pagan/Earthy feel to it and they should have just went with that.

*The corny song they have for Kai and Gerda's theme, it's got a really bad pop sound.

*The end leaves too much to the imagination for the snow queen, and I was expecting a lot more skating of just Kai and Gerda at the end since they had a huge scene in the beginning of them skating. Would have been a much better way to end it.

  The movie starts out well with good music, good atmosphere and passable acting. It's like this until we see the adult Gerta, and the whole movie goes downhill.

  The script is horrible; it makes one feel as though the writers deliberately chose the most awkward phrases for this movie to make one flinch. The acting is wooden, and the two main characters aren't likable in the least. Although I liked the Snow Queen the first time Gerta saw her (in all her dark-maiden glory), this was lessened the next time she came along. I felt they made a major mistake in making the Snow Queen have an american accent and speak casually - it makes her seem much less regal and imposing. I cringed when she said ""c'mere.""

Kai and the Snow Queen lack in places, but where they do everyone else makes up for them. The Girl who plays Gerda is sweet and pretty and all of the people she meets on the way are charming and delightful. The story flows nicely and it has very good dialgue.

1808782,2,B00007G232,"As Hans Christian Anderson's fairytale ""The Snow Queen"" is one of my favourite fairytales ever, you can only imagine my delight at learning Hallmark Entertainment (who is well known for creating lavish, beautiful visual productions) was adapting it for a movie. However, despite the beautiful costuming, makeup and set design, the faults found in the story and the acting don't quite make this a movie to treasure always. Though I certainly didn't loathe it, I continually grieved during my viewing of it at the opportunities lost to bring a potent fairytale to life.

Whoever wrote the screenplay must be well aware of the original fairytale, as several times there appear tiny details from the tale, such as the shadows of dreams appearing on the wall, and the words of the hidden roses in the garden. And yet, with all the beautiful material that Anderson has to offer, they insisted on changing large portions. Gone are the Lapland women, the talkative Crows, the helpful Prince and Princess and the children's beloved Grandmother. Perhaps they would not have been missed so much if they had been replaced by equally intriguing characters and a strong plot, but instead we get a strange jumble: the mirror whose part in the book serves as a simple and poetic reason as to why some people are determined to see the world as an ugly place becomes the focus of the drama: Kai does not have to write ""Eternity"" with shards of ice, but piece together the mirror so that the Queen may cover the world with Winter. Though he does get a shard in his eye, its effects are dubious - he's rude to Gerda and throws a snowball, but apart from that it seems to have little purpose, and is removed not by Gerda's warm tears, but the Snow Queen's icy kiss.

There are several new characters present, including a travelling Conjurer and a band of huntsmen who briefly use Gerda for target practice and then disappear. Other characters are warped beyond recognition: the magnificent reindeer who gallops through the snow in his delight at being freed is now a decrepit beast with a silly name. The nurturing, yet subtly overwhelming old woman becomes a psychotic personification of Spring with a bizarre taste in clothing. The children's beloved grandmother becomes a middle aged housekeeper who for some reason speaks in an Irish accent, which quite baffled me.

But despite contradicting several other reviews, I must say I enjoyed Bridget Fonda's performance as the Snow Queen. She is the only professional actor in the cast, and manages to bring to her character something I never perceived in Anderson's fairytale: a sense of vulnerability. It was a fascinating twist on the archetypical ""ice-queen"" and one cannot help but feel a twinge of pity for her at times. She carries herself like a true queen, and the cool tones of her voice perfectly match her appearance. Other notable performances include Kai, who is quite the sweetheart, and despite the distain of other reviewers,  I found the Robber Girl's performance quite refreshing and very true to the book, with her spoilt and temperament nature. And the polar bear who works as the Queen's guard and in love with her himself is a fascinating creation (due credit given to Jim Henson's Creature Shop), and one of the changes to the story that worked for me. The ambiguity of his transformation at the end may confuse some viewers, but I liked the extra touch of mystery it brought.

But a few performances bring this production screeching to a halt. It is said that eyes are the window to the soul, and forming expression within them is certainly one of the most important thing an actor can develop. But Chelsea Hobbs, who plays Gerda displays only one thing in them: complete and utter boredom. Though the fault may lie with the abysmal dialogue she is given, it hardly helps that she wanders through every scene as if in a stupor. And since the entire movie revolves around her as the protagonist, the core of the story cannot hold. If one does not care about the hero/heroine, one does not care about the movie and she is hardly helped by the actor playing her father Wolfgang, whose portrayal of grief is to sulk in a chair.

Likewise, the context of the story is in doubt: though it should have taken place in an ""olden day"" setting, the time placement is rather confusing to behold. The villagers search the wood with lanterns, yet on Wolfgang's desk is an electrical desk lamp. The Snow Queen's white sled is replaced with a flying snow-mobile. And as another reviewer pointed out, the use of modern slang, especially when its coming out of the mouths of the fairytale characters, is very jarring.

Despite beautiful visuals there is something severely lacking in this production, and I can only hope that one day someone will tell this story on the screen the way it ought to be told. If I could, I would give it two and a half stars, making it an exact balancing act between lost potential and complete mess.",1072828800,12,4965,4.752900232018561
1808783,2,B00007G232,"As far as I know there has never been and English version of this story done before now except for an episode of Shelly Duval's Fairie Tale Theater(It wasn't very good either but more faithful to the original tale at least.) Sadly this version isn't anything like Anderson's wonderful tale of growing up and discovering love. And since I don't recall another version having been made why make all the changes to the original story? It is easily long enough for a miniseries just left alone and done faithfully.
The two leads were completely wooden and boring, and the odd subplots they threw in as well as changing Gerda and Kay's ages just made it even more confusing.
I also agree that the change from it being a demon to being satan was cheap and silly. Completely uneccessary.
What I did like enough to give it two stars was Bridget Fonda and the Polar bear plot line, even though it had nothing to do with the original tale it was more interesting than the rest of the film. The film also looked really good, although I got confused as to where and when it was happening since folks tended to dress rather 19 century and everyone had accents ranging from French to American but they seemed to have a lot of modern lighting all over the buildings...And the weird subplot with Gerda's mother that was so badly written as to make the ending of the film completely silly.",1072742400,2,1372,4.536290322580645

1808811,2,B00007G232,"I recently took this off the shelf at my local video rental store because the picture on the box showed a white haired Bridget Fonda dressed in a beautiful sparkly white dress and a snow white cloak made of feathers. It looked to me like Hallmark Entertainment was going to at least try to do this film up right.
As it turned out, a lavish budget did provide many beautiful costumes, sets, and location scenery, but the simplicity and innocence of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale got lost in three hours of so-so acting, a poor screen play, dreadful dialog, bad film editing and lousy direction from David Wu.
In the original fairy tale the protagonists are two children named Kay and Gerda. In this film Kay has been changed to Kai and both Kai and Gerda are young adults who are in love.
One day Kai gets beguiled by the Snow Queen who rules the season of Winter and he is kidnapped and taken to her Ice Palace. Gerda begins a long (and in this film I do mean LONG) quest to discover his whereabouts and to rescue him. In order to do this she must travel through the lands of the other Seasons. She meets with the eccentric denizens of Spring, Summer and Autumn and each of them attempts to kidnap her. The idiosyncratic Andersen's take on the seasons was odd enough in the original story, but in this film is all the more exaggerated.
Kai has a talking Polar Bear (crafted with skill by Jim Henson's Creature Works) for a prison guard. His involvment with the polar bear is one of the many reasons this movie drags. Several ridiculous minutes are spent with Kai teaching the bear to ice-skate, for example.
The actors portraying Wolfgang, the father, Gerda, and Kai are tolerable if not note-worthy. Bridget Fonda, in my opinion, was not right for the part of the Snow Queen. Her performance is lackluster and she delivers her lines as though she's LaFemme Nikita rather than a character in a fairy tale. She looks the part but she doesn't seem particularly frosty or seductive as the script calls for her to be. Her lines are delivered in a flat emotionless way that I suppose is meant to be icy, but comes off as dull. You really wonder how in the world Kai could have been beguiled by such a person.
The interior sets, the costumes, the lighting...all the cosmetic trim of this film are beautiful and they are what made me so want to love this movie, but the magic is missing and I was never able to get swept away by the story.
At three hours in length and with a plot that focuses on mature themes of love lost, grief and seduction, even suicide, this film is most decidedly NOT for children of any age. Yet, with the corny talking bear and a talking reindeer and some really silly robber characters, I can't say it is a film for adults, either.
There is some really cheesy dialog that is too much like modern slang for example when the Summer Princess comments on Gerda's dress by saying, ""That peasant look is so last year,"" or later when she asks Gerda, ""Do I look a porker in this dress?""
There is  a whole lot of trite symbolism featuring red roses that further takes up time for no real benefit. In the original story Andersen has a ""demon"" creating havok with a magical mirror but in the film the minor league demon has been changed to Satan himself and they actually say the mirror is crafted in Hell. They make the devil look really cliche in this film and I feel it was too heavy-handed and out of sync with the rest of the picture. Sadly, this production just doesn't work. Even with a big budget, lavish decorations and costumes, talented actors, and a story that has enchanted people for over a century and a half, it still falls flat. I'd say skip this one...and for sure, do not try to make your kids sit through it. It's no fun.",1068595200,102,3757,4.429190751445087
1808812,2,B00007G232,"It's been months since I saw this so it's not that fresh, but I can say for sure that it's not a very memorable movie and pretty slow. I did make it to the end, unfortunately, and figured I pretty much just wasted time. Go get Arabian Nights.",1063497600,3,242,4.0625
1808813,1,B00007G232,"I saw this movie when it debuted on Hallmark. I wouldn't spend a half penny to buy it. While the wintry scenery is enjoyable, the plot fails quickly and the film is buried up to its eyebrows in poor acting. The spirit of winter comes out looking like a sadistic, homocidal sociopath with possible nymphomanical tendencies (ex. kidnapping Kai and constantly attempting to seduce him). The heroine is weakly portrayed and her supposed love for Kai is never demonstrated to any level higher than infatuation. The film is far too long; with the commercials, it ran for four hours. I stayed up till midnight only out of morbid curiosity to see how it might just possibly end. It's also intriguing how the writer tries to make Satan appear to be the cause of seasonal change. All in all, this movie is pathetic. It only deserves one star, and that only because of the efforts put in by the set designers.",1062720000,10,898,4.61875
1808814,2,B00007G232,"I agree with a previous review that this movie was too long. The story was too drawn out. As far as the Snow Queen was concerned, she needed a valium to calm her down and possibly help with her quicksilver mood swings. The polar bear was a creative idea, but why was he there? and why did he turn into a human in the end? I did enjoy the love story, but the young man didn't seem to get a grasp on who he wanted. Add the heroine with her journey to get her love back, and this three hour production became very frustrating for the characters and the audience. The love story seemed rushed, if it could be rushed in three hours, and a bit unbelievable. I felt they should have developed that more and maybe edited the Fall Queen's story, or even the long drawn out scenes with the Snow Queen. Ultimately, this movie was a disappointment to me. I was looking for something with more emotional substance. If you agree, try watching Snow White. It is a wonderful story.",1061424000,,965,4.3076923076923075

1808816,5,B00007G232,"This is a wonderful movie! I have read the original story by hans christen anderson and I love how hallmark interpreted this story, making some changes, but good ones. The scenery is gorgeous. The acting is A++. The costumes were incredible. It makes a lot more sense to have the romance between two teenagers instead of children, like in the book. Not that the book isn't good, but I actually prefer the hallmark movie to the book. If you love fairy tales, fantasy, or (like me) BOTH, this is a must have for your collection. I bought this without seeing it first and took a chance, but it is one I do NOT regret. I love this movie and highly recommend it. It is so sweet. The romance between Gerda and Kai is truly heart-warming. The ending is perfect. Take a chance with this one, you won't regret it. :-)",1048723200,,808,4.3933333333333335

1808818,4,B00007G232,"Wow, I didn't know you could still find good mainstream movies without vulgarity or massive amounts of sex.  This was really good.
The plot was good.  Seeing the main characters overcoming their long-lived sadness at the death of the main character's mother was worth the whole movie.  The scenery and characters were a delight.  I especially liked the polar bear who was in love with the Snow Queen.
The only things that kept this movie from getting five stars are as follows:
1.  The ""Fall Robber Queen"" and her daughter.  The former just didn't seem to fit and the latter was just plain annoying.
2.  The movie was rather long.  Around three hours, actually.  This is a little much for the ""whole family,"" as younger children will probably not keep their attention focused for that long.  And, if they do . . .
3.  The scene where Satan is forging the mirror was a bit creepy for an adult.  I can just imagine how a child will react to it.
But it is still a wonderful alternative to the stuff that normally comes out of Hollywood.",1047254400,62,1033,4.494623655913978
1808819,4,B00007G232,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I actually rented it based upon the cover of the DVD itself.  Love it ... beautiful cover.  The movie was great too though.  I have seen other versions of this fairy tale, Snow Queen, and loved those ... but I must say I am partial to this one.
SNOW QUEEN seemed like a VERY long movie, but I kind of liked that about it.  It was like you were going through the different seasons with the characters.  It made you better feel what they were going through.  Kai and Gerda are the 2 main characters ... both are great actors.  I believed they were truly in love.  The story line is excellent, as is the setting and dialogue.  For this type of ""innocent"" movie, it doesn't get much better than this.
The script keeps you entertained ... love the Snow Queen (exceptional acting on her part), and the psycho sister Queen, (I think it was Spring?) was OK too, but I didn't much care for the ""Robber/Gypsy Autumn Queen.""  It didn't quite fit.  I'm guessing the directors did this because they wanted each season to be distinctly different from one another.  For a ""children's"" movie, as a 20 something year old, I really enjoyed watching Snow Queen.  I would say it's OK for children 8 years and older.  If you like fantasy/fairy tale movies, SEE SNOW QUEEN.  It will melt your heart.",1046649600,9,1307,4.451476793248945

Then her father hires a new bellboy to work at his hotel. Kai is full of life and fun and Gerda is quickly drawn to him. Kai teaches Gerda how to skate, how to laugh,and even how to live. Their friendship turns into a strong first love...but it is short lived.
A lovely, but cold woman mysteriously turns up at the hotel, even though a winter storm has closed most roads. She is gone the next morning...and so is Kai. Everyone believes that Kai is dead, but Gerda suspects that that is far from the truth.
Gerda, on the slim chance that Kai is out there somewhere and needs her, sets off on a quest to find her one and only true love. Her journey takes her through mysterious lands where she encounters strange and wonderful people and faces many dangers. But finding Kai is only her first problem...

7975965,3,B00007G232,"Inspired by a Hans Christian Andersen story, this movie doesn't follow the book exactly, but follows the general idea.  The overall production was good.  The music was sappy.  The storytelling is definitely geared toward older children and I agree with other reviewers who noted that the pacing is slow.  I think the reason it seems slow is that there is no gradual build of discovery of information.  We aren't given any insight into the snow queen's history or motives (Why is she doing what she's doing?) until the very end of the final installment when everything is revealed at once.  (And as far as that goes, some things are never explained - like the polar bear.)  Kudos to the Spring Queen who was most effective in giving the feeling of seeming friendly and familiar but also creepy in the other-worldly way of dreams - and fairy tales.",1525046400,,846,4.714285714285714
