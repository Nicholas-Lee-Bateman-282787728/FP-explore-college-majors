7548302,5,B018FR91Q8,"Talvar gives me so many reasons to be thankful for in life, I am sure that it will  be the same for many who watch this revelation of a movie. It is especially wrenching to see the parents as they discover the corpse of their only daughter.
Then we find out that this is beginning of more bad things to come. Then your anger intensifies because the police destroy the scene of crime and at the end of the film, the courts decide that a lack of evidence is no reason for dropping the case against the parents and they are promptly ushered to prison. The reason that I am giving you the spoilers is because you must know that the movie is based on real incidents from the Aarushi/Hemraj murders of 2008 and it is not a whodunit but an point of view retelling from the main characters.  It also is an honest observation about the law and legal system in India.
Meghna Gulzar take us to the day when the two corpses were found. As soon as the police arrive, the crime scene is contaminated and the police declare it a solved murder mystery. However higher authorities soon realize that the police have botched up the case and they hand it to the Central Department of Investigation. The person handling the case is not interested in the case because he knows it is a mess. Reluctantly he digs deeper....
Talvar reminds us that life as we know it can easily be snatched from us and turned in to a twisted game in an instant.
Almost every Indian has read about the Aarushi/Hemraj case and the many tales, gossip that have floated around. We all have made up our minds and opinions.
The police have made some sensational claims about honor killings, rape, extramarital affairs, swingers parties and made the parents both suspects and fodder for sensationalism. The investigation by CDI is also compromised and shallow.
Meghna Gulzar directs this story with so much courage, and the story is  stunning even if you have seen or heard it on the news, a countless times on an endless loop.
The casting is perfect and the known and unknown faces makes this one of the most notable.
Konkona Sen Sharma and Neeraj Kabi -- as Nutan and Ramesh Tandon, the leads have the most difficult role in this film that looks at the murders from different perspectives.
Gajraj Rao, the bumbling amateur, inept and despicable police inspector who singlehandedly botches the investigation is phenomenal. All of the ensemble is perfect in the film and then there is Irrfan Khan, who makes indifference so cool. He is fantastic.
In the end, it is the film that stays with you and then it strikes you that this is not a story it is reality and justice was not served. It will bite you...Release date 2nd October, 2015.",1450483200,3,2686,4.545454545454546

7548304,5,B018FR91Q8,"Pretty much a true story. And correctly nails Krishna as the actual murderer. And accurately depicts the Talwars as innocent and a victim of the atrocious Indian system.

Also read the book Aarushi by Avirook Sen.

P.S. I saw it in the theater.",1448668800,2,244,4.651162790697675

8742253,4,B018FR91Q8,"What is to say? It is an Irfan movie. Well dramatized. Well played by all.  Having said that I just wish Indian movies stayed away from incorporating Western tragic  touches  - in this case Irfan's personal life being on the rocks ala scores of somewhat similar genre Hollywood movies. Irfan's subdued and subtle role playing - always a pleasure to experience - is more than neutralized by the excessiveness and the lingering show of the police inspector's pan chewing boorishness. We got the idea Director Sahib,  so move on for heaven's sake.",1478131200,,544,4.880434782608695
8742254,5,B018FR91Q8,"Talvar is an entertaining yet instructive but also a disturbing viewing experience.

To Post-O.J. Simpson American viewers, the elements of this film are all too familiar. Horrific crime scene; grizzly murders; botched criminal investigation; incompetent crime investigators; compromised crime scene; contaminated evidence; INADMISSIBLE evidence; media frenzies creating a circus atmosphere; clashing egos; glamorous victims; sleazy, shady government officials; coerced confessions    its all here. Mixed in this mess are a spate of civil rights violations which would make an American criminal defense lawyers mind spin.

For those of us who witnessed the O.J. Simpson trial you will think you are experiencing a flashback. For those of you who didnt, well, this is what it was like.

Based on true-life murders in India, this movie is similar to Rashomon, running possible scenarios of what really happened and who was really responsible in the 2008 Noida double murder case. The film attempts to peel back each and every layer of the case. The involvement of every possible suspect is examined.

Talvar is also a very disturbing film. We see, up close, how cavalier law enforcement can be when prosecuting a criminal investigation, contrasted with the real genuine grief experienced by the parents. The performances in this film are strong and the action is gripping. You will feel every measure of grief and anguish depicted in this film.

This film should be required viewing in any criminal law class. The film correctly depicts the tension that exists in all criminal investigations. On the one hand, there is a strong interest in the swift prosecution of criminals, and on the other there is an equally strong interest in seeing that justice is done. This is why, as one character points out, the statue of Justice is blind-folded, carrying scales in one hand and a sword in the other. The key is finding the balance. It is fair to say that balance was not found here.

So is it that in many criminal investigations, the truth proves to be elusive. The 2008 Noida double murder case may be an extreme case. While a conviction resulted from this messed up prosecution, you, the viewer, may or may not agree the right individuals are in jail.",1477958400,,2248,5.086956521739131

8742256,5,B018FR91Q8,"Tight script, excellent acting, and much to think about in this film based on the horrifying true story of a teenager's murder in a middle-class Delhi enclave and the various miscarriages of justice that followed. The stellar cast is headed by Irrfan Khan, Neeraj Kabi, and Konkona Sen Sharma; Vishal Bhardwaj's script analyzes all the angles.

8742257,2,B018FR91Q8,"I was quite disappointed with this one. Despite a polished cast and experienced crew, the film felt disjointed and bumpy. The narrative seemed to be cobbled together in a hurry so the release date could be met. Wasted my time on this one.",1469232000,,238,4.558139534883721

8742260,5,B018FR91Q8,"Irfan Khan is a masterful actor. He approaches this role with grim humor. As a commentary on recent police work in India, it shows investigative methods to be primitive. Corruption, lack of any work ethic, laziness and compassion for the victims comes through. You don't even get an idea that things will change. That is discouraging.",1455753600,,334,4.982142857142857
