6878771,5,B00QSRJZ7S,"Most thorough explanation of Zhan Zhuang that I've seen. The DVD follows the same topics covered in the book, and expands with detailed examples shown by Mark and his colleagues.
Incredibly useful for a beginner practitioner, and even those familiar with this Qigong practice might find some new information.",1421193600,14,308,5.3061224489795915

8692732,5,B00QSRJZ7S,"Exceptional on the detail and filmed in a way that is accessible to the everyday person.  This DVD has more useful information on all aspects of Zhan Zhuang than anything I have encountered since I began using Zhan Zhuang in 1996. Especially useful to me was the Longevity Breathing and instructions on how to open the joints of the body. There is a lifetime of knowledge in this DVD, much more than just posture instruction. I have read the work of Jan Diepersloot, Master Lam Kam Chuen and even Yu Yongnian. This DVD and the book by the same title  are both heads above in depth and instruction. If you want to learn how to practice Zhan Zhuang, this DVD and the book are  what you need.",1481846400,7,689,4.409448818897638

8692738,5,B00QSRJZ7S,Mark Cohen's DVD companion to his excellent book Inside Zhan Zhuang is a welcome addition and further enhances the most complete and through work in English on this pillar of Internal Martial Arts and Health practice.  Clear precise and easy to follow instruction along with the depth of Mark's book are essential to both beginner and advanced practitioners alike. Highly recommend both DVD and book.,1422921600,11,400,5.153846153846154
