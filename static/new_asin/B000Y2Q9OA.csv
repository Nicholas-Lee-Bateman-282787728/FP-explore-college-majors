8692988,3,B000Y2Q9OA,"First off let me say that I live in Texas. The Dallas/Fort Worth area actually. And seeing as Denton (the city where the XCW arena is) is only about 20 minutes away, I thought ""Hey why not?""

So I went to one of their shows, and I really enjoyed it. The crowd was hot, and swore like there waws no tomorrow. I liked it enough that I bought Battlebox 8 on DVD from my local Best Buy. Now Battlebox 8 was a good show, because it had so many gimmick matches it wasn't funny. Barbed Wire, Ladders, Tables, Steel Cage....and that's when I realized the only way this company had really good matches was if they were hardcore gimmick matches.

This show, had NO gimmick matches, and was only an hour and a half long. Battlebox 8 was 2 hours. I was expecting horrible wrestling, but one match on this card showed I was wrong.

On to the review (P.S. No match ending spoilers will be revealed):

1) John Allen vs Dave The Rave and Steve Mooney

Well this match was bad. Not a good way to start off the show. John Allen is a really out of shape, unknown wrestler who wrestled like he just woke up 5 seconds ago. Dave the Rave was alright, but I don't see him or Allen ever becoming anything special. All in all, not even a passable match. They have FAR better talent.

3/4*

2) Action Jackson and Sidd Murder vs Team Extreme for #1 contendership for the XCW Tag Team titles.

First off, this isn't The Hardyz Team Extreme. It's just 2 fat old guys who look nothing like them. Jackson and Murder definately carried this match to being solid. They had the charisma that the last match lacked, and worked pretty professionally. The thing that bugged me though, is that so far, everyone had been wrestling a very sports entertainment/WWE style, rather than the usual indy style that independent promotions like these usually do. All in all, solid.

**1/2

3) JT Lamotta vs Larry Canyunga vs Gemini for Gemini's TNT Title.

Wow, this match showed me, that this company DOESN'T need gimmick matches to have good matches. This actually WAS indy wrestling. Larry Canyunga looks like a fatter version of Jerry Lynn, but dammit he is such an athlete. He pulled off an asai moonsault to the outside! A sloppy moonsault, but that can be forgiven, seeing as how small, yet packed the venue is. Gemini also does this crazy somersault over the turnbuckle to the outside! Ah! I loved this match, but my only gripe had to be that it was too short. Maybe 10 minutes. MAYBE. It definitely stole the show, and was really good, but it lacked the time needed to make it great. Oh and there was a ref knockout.

***1/2

4) ""Main Event"" Mike Foxx lays down a $500 challenge to anyone who can beat him. Wait! Now he raised it to $1000! Who's coming out for the challenge? Li Fang!!! A very thin looking man who has that Low-Ki look to him. This was just a boring squash to set up the next match. I will spoil this one. Li Fang lost.

SQUASH

5) ""Main Event"" Micke Foxx $1000 challenge part 2! This time Redd Dawg comes out. That's right. Anyone remember Redd Dawg? He used to be in WWE, but apparently had been black-balled from any major promotion. I don't know too much about it, but whatever. On to the match. Nothing special. Average. Oh there was another ref knockout, and a stupid ending.

6) International Playaz Club (Scott Mckenzie and D Skrilla Danny) vs Drunk Adam and Louie The Hand.

Good match, I see a lot of future potential with Scott Mckenzie. Danny is good too, but he just doesn't have whatever Mckenzie has. All in all, a good match, but still not as good as the Triple Threat earlier. This was given a good amount of time, but still didn't feel like anything special.
Oh and did I mention there was a ref knockout?

***

Final Rating: 6.5 (An average show)
Second Opinion: 6.75
Recommendation: Pass on this. If you're looking for some good XCW, I'd recommend Battlebox 8. Not 7, but 8.",1210464000,,3872,4.420534458509142
