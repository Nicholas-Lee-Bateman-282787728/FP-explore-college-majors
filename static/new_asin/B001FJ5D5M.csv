3587630,3,B001FJ5D5M,"The best things about this serial are what the DVD production company decided to place on the cover: Nicholas Courtney returning as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, Jean Marsh, and the Destroyer.  The worst things about this serial are almost everything else.

The previous season, Ben Aaronovitch wrote the well-received&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/REMEMBRANCE-OF-THE-DALEKS/dp/B00005Y6XI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">REMEMBRANCE OF THE DALEKS</a>&nbsp;which had a strong logical structure, contained some subtle and some obvious themes, and generally held together satisfactorily.  BATTLEFIELD, on the other hand, has multiple flaws even including such basic oddities as characters acting and emoting wildly different from scene to scene.

The storyline (bringing the legends of King Arthur into the Doctor Who universe) looks good on the surface but quickly becomes a bit of a shambles.  I got the impression of a story going through far too many rewrites, leaving disconnected, orphaned artifacts from previous drafts in the mix. If one were to perform an archaeological excavation on the script, one might discover what purpose Excalibur's scabbard ultimately served. Shou Yuing appears to have absolutely no reason whatsoever to be in the story other than one scene in which she inadvertently provides the Brigadier with a car (when the credits ran, I actually had to rewind the DVD to figure out if she had appeared in the final scene). Why is UNIT randomly moving a nuclear missile around the English countryside?  Why does the Brigadier ask Morgaine to surrender before knowing who she is?  Why does Excalibur suddenly wake up and start transmitting a distress call after centuries of dormancy?

There are some neat ideas in the script.  I like the Doctor being an alternative universe version of Merlin in his own personal future (there's enough plausible deniability to keep it interesting).  More like the usual Aaronovitch style, Morgaine's customs and sense of honor follow a logical, if skewed, pattern (witness her ruthless killing of the helicopter pilot followed quickly by the magical restoration of a blind woman's sight).  And call me sentimental, but I like seeing Lethbridge-Stewart called out of retirement for one more adventure.

One can spot moments that would work in one of Ben Aaronovitch's New Adventure (NA) novels, but which aren't quite successful on TV.  For a trivial example take the scene of the Doctor waking up Ancelyn and Brigadier Female Dave Lister by bursting an empty crisp packet.  Or think about how much better the ""chalk circle"" scene would be on the written page.

As for other aspects of the production, the direction unfortunately takes a few cues from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WARRIORS-OF-THE-DEEP/dp/B00142UZ9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WARRIORS OF THE DEEP</a>; both productions feature the popular Doctor Who military strategic formation of soldiers standing shoulder to shoulder in a straight line, taking absolutely no cover and shooting at each other.

The directing in general is a bit on the poor side.  Talky scenes are mostly adequate, but anything remotely ambitious more often than not turns into a disaster.  Two of the silliest scenes from the original Doctor Who series can be found here.  The first, the infamous ""Boom!"" scene which allegedly features a man in armor thrown through the air by an exploding grenade cross-cut with massive closeups of Sophie Aldred's lip gloss.  The second, the sequence where Mordred summons reinforcements from an alternate dimension by laughing uproariously for about a half an hour.

At times the production seems much more interested in showing off their rented helicopter than in scenes which would further or explain the plot.  The cheaply-made Excalibur is buried in what bizarrely looks like an undersea disco.  The snake thing which chases the Doctor and Ace for seemingly an eternity looks awful.  The Destroyer on the other hand is a realistic and genuinely impressive costume and mask, and is wisely held back and then used very effectively in the story's conclusion.

As for the special extended, movie-format edition included on the second disc, to be honest, I'm surprised they bothered doing this. A few other Doctor Who stories have undergone this treatment, but those were stories that started out good to begin with.  Sure, on some level it's nice to have restored or extended scenes, but in many cases, it's clear to see why they had been cut in the first place.  The Brigadier and Ace rivalry may have sounded nice on paper, but the filmed version just feels too forced and extraneous.  Couldn't we have simply had this footage as an isolated menu option the way that other DVD releases have done?  The problems with this story are too fundamental to be solved by a simple re-edit.  Nor do new special effects (which are sure to date as quickly as the originals they replace) particularly add to anything other than the price of a second DVD.

The DVD commentary is a quite a lot of fun and a division springs up almost instantly between the actors and the behind-the-scenes folks.  Ben Aaronovitch and script editor Andrew Cartmel hold court, ripping apart virtually all aspects of the production (with the exception of the performers).  Actors Nicholas Courtney, Sophie Aldred and Angela Bruce meekly try to play defense but mostly sit around talking about how much fun the taping was.  The ""making of"" documentary was pretty good too with some honest discussion about everything that went right and wrong.

A lot of what the script was attempting (things like the Doctor being a mysterious alien with strange unknowable powers, but who is content to stay behind and make supper) would not be fully implemented and achieved until the NAs.  Indeed, aspects of the story feel a lot like the type of thing that would be developed later.  Re-watching BATTLEFIELD did make me nostalgic for my NA collection, although I'd rather revisit some of those excellent novels than spend much time seeing where elements of their success began.",1244246400,2,6145,5.343717549325026
3587631,5,B001FJ5D5M,"I never did much care for most of Sylvester McCoy's stories. The only ones I thought were any good were ""Time and the Rani"", ""Remembrance of the Daleks"", ""Ghost Light"", and ""The Curse of Fenric"". But I had never seen this one before until it was released on DVD, and I loved it. ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" is still my favorite one, but now this is my second favorite. Written by the same writer who wrote ""Remembrance"", this has a very good plot. Futuristic knights from another dimension come to Earth to claim the legendary sword of King Author himself. With this sword in their power, their queen will be able to conquer the universe. Now the Doctor (A.K.A. - Merlyn), Ace, and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (who has been recalled into UNIT) must stop them at all costs. Action-packed (like ""Remembrance""), performances are good, and most of the special affects aren't that bad. The Destroyer was one of the most realistic creatures ever featured in the original series. Highly recommended!

P.S.
This DVD includes both the original four-part version and a new extended feature-length version with new and better effects.",1241654400,8,1124,4.947089947089947

3587633,2,B001FJ5D5M,"In a word, this is a typical McCoy, cloudy plot, uninteresting characters, no rewatch value, and some ridiculous revelation about the Doctor being Merlin the Magician, once again tampering with the Doctor's background, or future-ground... The only redeeming quality is the return of the Brigadier, the REAL ONE, not the forced-upon-us politically correct version, who by the way is horrible. If I hear her cry ""Oh Shame"" once more I'll...I'll...well, you get the picture. Winifried Bambera is so nauseating in episode one, running around giving everyone orders, advancing on caves, yelling ""freeze""... Luckily, the old school Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart arrives and usurps some of her authority, reducing her to merely running around dodging knights in shining armour, and not figuring as prominently as in the first episode.

As bad as the PC Brig was, she is not the worst character in Battlefield. That distinction goes to Young Shoe or whatever her name was, by far the worst guest character and actress in Doctor Who history. The phrase to best describe this character is utterly useless. She had no bearing on the story, seemingly added simply to give little Ace someone to play with when she's not blowing things up. Speaking of Ace, she gets my vote as the worst assistant ever. The cliffhanger to episode two has her trapped in a tube filling with water. It's the only time in Doctor Who I've ever hoped the companion gets killed. One irritating scene has the Brigadier telling Bambera to get Ace a blanket because she is drenched in water, a caring, chivalrous thing to do. Yet, they look at him like he has the plague, still giving orders. That scene alone shows how Doctor Who drastically changed for the worse during the McCoy years. Even Young Shoe looks at the poor Brigadier and shakes her head. How dare they mock a Doctor Who legend. Rightfully, the show got cancelled after this season.

Admittedly, however, Jean Marsh as Morgraine is very commendable as a somewhat sympathetic villain. One minute she is disintegrating a helpless UNIT soldier, but the very next she restores the sight of a blind woman. She even leads a ceremony to pay homage to Britain's war casualties. Ms. Marsh is very old school Doctor Who, and it shows.

Speaking of UNIT, this story displays PC at its most gut-wrenching. Check out all the nationalities represented by UNIT soldiers, Russian, French, etc. Why? Do we really need to go there? As the Brigadier asks one of the soldiers, ""You're not English, are you?""

On a final positive note, one of the very few positives in this sea of misery, we finally get to see Doris, the Brigadier's wife, who was referred to in The Daemons, a real classic story. Only watch this one for the return of Alistaire Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart. The scenes of him and Doris are by far the best in the story.",1232668800,11,2837,4.855371900826446
3587634,4,B001FJ5D5M,"Of all of Sylvester McCoy's outings as Doctor Who, this is one of my favorites, right up there with Remembrance of the Daleks and Silver Nemesis.  Now, in reality, the storyline for this one is not that great and rather corny at times.  Knights from an alternate dimension do battle with swords against UNIT.  COME ON!  Plus, the villainess in this episode, Morgaine, is so campy that you want to laugh every time she appears on screen.  She's like the Wicked Witch of the West meets the Bridge of Dracula! In the scene where she tries to scare Ace into giving her something she wants, I half expected her to say ""I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too!  Ha, ha, ha!""

So why do I love this episode?  Answer: THE BRIG IS BACK AND KICKING A--!  The Brigadier was one of my all time favorite Doctor Who characters, and he had not been seen in Doctor Who since the Five Doctors six years earlier.

In many ways, the Brigadier is closer to the Doctor than any of his companions because he is one of the few that knew him through most of his regenerations.  In a way, this gives him a special bond with the Doctor, and although they came into conflict with one another at times regarding the Brig's tendency to turn to the artillery a little too quickly, they genuinely like and respect each other.  And it shows in this story.  Nicholas Courtney and Sylvester McCoy play the relationship between the Brigadier and the Doctor so well, and trully reflect their shared history.

Ace's reaction to this relationship is also perfectly played out. She recognizes that even though she and the Doctor are close, these two men share a bond and history that she never will have with him, and this makes her jealous beyond belief.  However, she and the Brig bond when they get to blow stuff up!

I also love Courtney's portrayal of the Brigadier showing his age, but not having lost his spirit.  As always, he is the hero willing to confront the alien menace head on with his primitive human weaponry backed by his virtue and sense of duty.

By the way, speaking of Brigadiers, the new Brigadier, Winnifred Bambera, is awesome too! I am so glad that they brought UNIT back for this story because it did harken back to days gone by, while at the same time updating UNIT and their capabilities (but not in the hammy, way over the top way the new Doctor Who series has--no comic book floating aircraft carriers in the sky here, thank goodness).

I can not wait until this DVD is released.  I have the story on video, but the extras on these Doctor Who DVD's add something special to each story.  I haven't seen the particulars on this DVD's features, but I hope Nicholar Courtney was on hand for the commentary.",1231891200,15,2702,4.484662576687117

3587637,5,B001FJ5D5M,"This is one of the best Classic Who episodes.

It's got a wonderful amount of inclusion for all of it's side characters. Modern Who could take a few steps with the interracial relationship and the very obvious subtext with Ace and her friend. The plot line is ""King Arthur meets Doctor Who"" and it works very well. There's a plot twist with Merlin that I won't spoil here but it left me giggling for weeks after the more and more I thought of the implications for Modern Who.

This shouldn't be your first Classic Episode however. To get the most from your viewing you really need to know The Brig. As this was written to be his last episode (and it was. Unless you count The Audios, Sarah Jane Smith, and Series 8) where he interacted with The Doctor on screen.

The production is flimsy in several ways, since it was produced by John ""watch me run Who into the ground"" Nathan-Turner, but in this story the flimsiness can be overlooked.

3587654,4,B001FJ5D5M,"I was rather intrigued when I first learned of Battlefield. Featuring my favorite Doctor Sylvester McCoy, the return of UNIT and tying into Arthurian legend (which I'm rather intrigued in) it was going to be an interesting story to view. While Battlefield turned out not to be a classic along the lines of say&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Curse-of-Fenric/dp/B0001GF25G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Curse of Fenric</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-Light/dp/B0007VY5QM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost Light</a>, Battlefield stills proves to be an exciting and ever watchable Doctor Who story.

At the heart of it all is Sylvester McCoy and Sophie Aldred as the seventh Doctor and Ace. Both show off their remarkable chemistry that made them one of the most successful TARDIS crews of the original series. McCoy in particular gets some fine acting moments such as the ""there will be no battle here!"" section of part three and the nuclear weapons speech in part four. Aldred also gives a nice performance as Ace though the character does come across as being downright immature at times. That said there are plenty of good things to say about Aldred's performance especially in the special edition's scenes with Brigadie Lethbridge-Stewart. As always the delight for watching a story from the McCoy era lies in the splendid work of its leading cast.

The story also features another one of the great things of the McCoy era: a fine supporting cast. Nicholas Courtney makes a welcomed return as UNIT's former commander Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart even if there are moments where he is pushing credibility at one or two moments. That said Courtney gets the best lines of the story including part four's classic ""I just do the best I can!"" plus some fine moments with McCoy's Doctor. Also of special mention is Jean Marsh who gives a well-stated and even believable performance as the Arthurian villainess Morgaine, the result being one of the single best performances of the McCoy era. There's also a nice performance from Angela Bruce as the new Brigadier in charge of UNIT, Winnifred Bambera, which makes it a shame that the show didn't get to go on much past this story and we never got to see more of the character. There's also nice performances from James Ellis, Marcus Gilbert, Robert Jezek and Angela Davis amongst others. That said there are some rather mixed performances from Christopher Bowen as an over-the-top (and out of place) version of Mordred and Ling Tai as the immature Shou Young. All said though it is as good a supporting cast as any to be found in the McCoy era.

The story has some nice production values as well. The sets and costumes are nicely done considering the low-budget the show was forced to work within. Thi is especially true of the Knights armor which, while not the sort of futuristic thing originally envisioned, stands up well today because it isn't futuristic. There's also the Destoryer in parts three and four who in a short space of time leaves a huge impression. Te Detroyer is a brilliantly realized creation as not only a fantastic monster but as a personification of Oppenheimer's ""destoryer of worlds"" as he described nuclear weapons which gives the story a nice piece of symmetry as well. That said the production values aren't perfect.

Battlefield suffers from two very distinct problems in the forms of its special effects and music. While special effects in the original Doctor Who series have a;ways been a mixed affair anyway here they are sadly lacking at times such as he Knights guns that do little more then shoot sparks or the sad looking exterior effects related to the Destroyer towards the end of the story. There's also the mater of the score by Keff McCulloch which works for the most part but is at times seeming out of place at times then too loud and too brash at others, especially in the action sequences. thankfully there is an answer to some of those problems (more on that later).

One of the more successful elements of Battlefield is the script by Ben Aaronovitch. Doctor Who has time and again proved itself capable of adopting mythologies for its own purposes the Battlefield is no exception. The story makes fine use of the Arthurian legend with its use of its heroes and villains, giving the story an anchor in on the long lasting and best known mythologies of the Western world. Even more interesting from the Arthurian standpoint is that the Doctor is identified as being as Merlin which not only makes for a nice plot device but adds a nice bit of mystery back to the Doctor. There's also a nice return to some of the elements of the series own mythology including the return of UNIT and its original commander Lethbridge-Stewart, the Doctor's old car Bessie and the morality about war and diplomacy that ran throughout the original UNIT stories of the 1970's. The latter is particularly evident in the Doctor's speech on nuclear weapons (written in fact by script editor Andrew Cartmel) towards the story's conclusion. While the story has some structural issues (such as a slow moving first episode and the Lethbridge-Stewart taking half the story before really making an impact on events) the script is a good one and it stands up well.

The second disc of the DVD release contains a special edition movie length version of the story. First off it contains some deleted scenes which add not only some explanations but add onto the relationship between Ace and Lethbridge-Stewart. Yet the biggest improvement to the story is the incorporation of new CGI effects. The aforementioned knight's guns now have beams with the sparks which help to make them believable plus there are some nice improvements to effects all through the story. Of particular mention is the effect of Morgaine summoning the Destroyer's shadow from her crystal ball which even had my little brother saying ""whoa!"" The special edition also attempts to fix the issues with the music as well though this is only a partial success and it is a shame that Mark Ayers (who supervised the special edition and created the best scores of the McCoy era) didn't take the opportunity to redo the music entirely Even with the issues the special edition is a considerable success and something of an improvement over the original.

The DVDs special features are as good as any as those on any other Who DVD. On top of the above mentioned special edition version of the story there are a total of four documentaries : three on the making if the story (including one about the famous water tank incident that occurred) and one featuring actress Jean Marsh discussing her three appearances on the original series of Doctor Who. There's an audio commentary featuring actors Sophie Aldred, Angela Bruce and Nicholas Courtney plus writer Ben Aaronovitch and script editor Andrew Cartmel in which the group discuss the story, their remembrances of it and give it criticism (especially from Aaronovitch and Cartmel) some needed some unneeded. Add on the usual info subtitle option and photo gallery and the special features are up to par.

So where does Battlefield stand? Well while it has its issues (even with the new special edition version included here) it is still an enjoyable and ever watchable piece of Doctor Who.

Really, Really love Brigadier Winifred Bambera and Ancelyn they are the cutest.  The Doctor and Ace are awesome as always.  Highly recommended!",1478044800,,244,5.17948717948718
8302096,5,B001FJ5D5M,"I thoroughly enjoyed this Sylvester McCoy story, one of his best. Nicholas Courtney is always a blast and Jean Marsh is a great villain. The DVD itself is heavy on extras and special features. It's out of print, so you may have to dish out some extra dough, but it's well worth it!",1476316800,,281,4.320754716981132

8302099,5,B001FJ5D5M,"Funny, this was the last one that I needed to complete my collection and it is the best of all of the Sylvester McCoy stories. This story brings back a retired Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart in his final Dr. Who story. In this story the doctor and Ace must face off against Morgaina who wants Excalibur and believes that King Arthur will rise to fight her again. Ace obtains Excalibur and Morgaina tries to get it from her. In the meantime the Doctor who Morgaina believes is Merlin fights to defeat Morgaina. It's a solid Doctor Who story with some interesting plot points. Not to mention an interesting ending that in this viewers opinion humanizes the Doctor a little.

8302100,5,B001FJ5D5M,"This has become a hard-to-find (at a reasonable price) DVD set over the years in Region 1. Maybe they only manufactured a relatively small run of them? Prices seem to range from $35 to over $100, even on Amazon.
Yes, it's campy, even by Sylvester McCoy standards. But it's still a darned good yarn with a hint of menace. Not by any means one of top McCoy stories, but not near the bottom of the barrel, either. My VHS copy is wearing out, so I was glad to finally find this nearer the cheaper end of the price spectrum.",1469750400,,519,4.252525252525253

8302102,5,B001FJ5D5M,"Bought this story for ~$28 back in '09 but I see they want ~$70 now. Includes the transmitted 4 episode version on one disc with lots of special features while the other disc has a feature movie style with no episode breaks. But $35/disc is a bit steep for me, I must have caught some sort of sale. Stars Sylvester McCoy as the renegade time lord but make sure you turn on the subtitles as Sylvester is difficult to understand.",1455235200,,427,4.35
8302103,4,B001FJ5D5M,"The Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) receives a distress signal originating near the English village of Carbury in the early 1990s. Being a lad after an adventure, he shows up and discovers an archaeological dig near a fabled battlefield where King Arthur and Modred are supposed to have their final battle. Armored knights from another dimension show up and start fighting each other and the UNIT troops stationed nearby (they are guarding a nuclear missile that they brought in for no clear reason other than it becomes a plot device toward the end). With the Doctor's presence soon discovered, the UNIT people put in a call to retired Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. The Brigadier goes once more into the breach for his dear friend. In the mean time, evil witch queen Morgaine has shown up, mistaken the Doctor for Merlin, and is ready to summon the Destroy of Worlds to get what she wants. Mayhem ensues.

The plot is fairly interesting if a bit daft. The actors are all good, especially Jean Marsh as the well-written Morgaine, a villain with more depth than usual on the show. Her son Modred is a bit cartoony--his maniacal laughter goes on too long in some scenes. McCoy is good as the Doctor, able to swing from the comedically absurd to the dramatically heavy without looking silly. Weirdly, the sword fight scenes are much better than the gun battles. The alternate dimension knights have futuristic guns that use fairly inferior practical effects. Classic Doctor Who fans are used to some rubbish visual effects, I suppose. On the other hand, the makeup for the demonic Destroyer is quite impressive and the Lady in the Lake moment is great fun.

This set of four half-hour episodes is well worth watching.",1452729600,,1715,4.890034364261169
