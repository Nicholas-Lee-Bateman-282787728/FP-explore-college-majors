89336,5,0790732181,"This movie is set squarely in my top ten of all time, and rightly so....a heavily allegoric tale of free spirited man versus the establishment, and good versus evil, it was responsible for launching so many careers of , up to that point, not that well known actors and actresses.....

Danny DeVito was hardly known at that time and went on to have an abundance of incredible material in the rest of his career...Louise Fletcher was catapulted from an unknown via her winning on Oscar in this film...Sidney Lassick went on to make many movies after his classic ""Mr. Cheswick"" performance in this one. Brad Dourif replayed his twitchy nervous eccentric style in so many other roles also, after being the perfect actor for ""Billy""....Will Sampson, the giant of a man, playing the Chief, also had a budding career after this only to have it tragically cut short by Cancer.
Michael Berryman went on to play numerous oddball roles, including his iconic mutant family member in Craven's Hills have Eyes. William Redfield, playing Harding,  had never had the kind of spotlight that he had in this movie, previously relegated to meaningless character roles. Scatman Crothers was another endless character actor part player, who also achieved much more exposure in this movie.

And of course, at the time, it simply cemented Jack Nicholson's status as the current  ( at that time ) best male actor in the world, and to this day, most would probably say it was his greatest performance.

I don't know if it is possible that some people might not have seen this film , but if you are one of them, don't miss watching what an Oscar winner should be all about!",1517616000,,1646,4.76140350877193

89341,5,0790732181,"Ken Kesey's One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest was my absolute favorite ""bestseller"" novel for many years.  I read it several times from my high school years through college and after.  Outside of fantasy fiction and sci-fi, in the late 60's and early 70's I was an avid reader of the exploratory crowd (Kesey, Huxley, Timothy Leary, Kerouac, Carlos Castaneda, et al.) and the magnum opus of this literature for me was this novel.  Kesey captured the multiple layers of conflict which represent those inherent in greater society with a razor sharp scalpel and ingeniously did it through the eyes and vision of a mute paranoid schizophrenic Native American who, though huge in stature, believes he is a tiny and insignificant spirit watching the world in a fog from within his own dark shadows.  In the novel, the chief is the seer and the story teller, the relater of the protagonists Randle Patrick McMurphy and Nurse Ratched, as an allegory for the struggle between good and evil in the imagined ""combine"" which has his world enslaved.

Milos Forman's film version of the book is its own cinematic masterpiece, different from the novel in many respects while holding on to the integrity of the conflicts and characters.  The main difference is the viewpoint of the film which unfortunately diminishes the character of Chief Bromden (Will Sampson) to a secondary role (though he may be seen as the story's ""hero"" still in the end).  Michael Douglas produced this masterpiece after his father Kirk Douglas had acquired the rights to make it into a Broadway play (with himself playing the lead McMurphy).  Michael was a political activist student when he convinced his father that he wanted to make it into a movie as it represented, to him, one man against the establishment.  As insane an idea as the insanity of the story, Douglas and production partner Saul Zaentz decided to film the movie in a real mental hospital and use actual patients as actors supporting the lead characters Brad Dourif (Billy Bibbit), Christopher Lloyd (Taber), and a young Danny DeVito (Martini) who was Douglas' oldest friend and roommate in the 60's.  Other actors included a real hospital superintendent Dr. Dean Brooks as Doctor Spivey, Will Sampson (Chief Bromden), Sydney Lassick (Charlie Cheswick), Marya Small (Candy Starr), and William Redfield (Dale Harding).

For all their efforts, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Actress (Louise Fletcher), Best Screenplay Adapted from Other Material (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman), and Best Director (Milos Forman).

If you have read the novel and somehow have never seen this film, get it, you will not be disappointed.  If you have seen the film and not read the novel, I urge you emphatically to do so, the rewards are immense.  Once you can appreciate the film as a cinematic achievement and the novel as a true work of literature, your pleasure will be compounded as you fall in love with both.

The 2 disc Special Edition I purchased, is an anamorphic 1.85:1 print and 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack, both of which are pristine.  Disc 2 has an excellent documentary, some deleted scenes, and a few other items of interest to ber fans of the film and book.  Purchased in 2005, this movie is in regular rotation for viewing and has lost none of its luster.",1516752000,,3354,4.907964601769912

89365,2,0790732181,"I saw this movie at a theater upon its initial release and considered it a masterpiece.  On a second viewing, my evaluation has changed dramatically.  This movie is a far-fetched, vulgar, depressing story about suffering, cruelty, violence, and gore that seems to run forever.  All of its numerous attempts at humor fall flat.  It is supposedly redeemed by 30 seconds of triumph at the end.",1505865600,,390,4.953846153846154

89368,2,0790732181,"The movie is not up to the hype. It's rather slow, and the psychiatric hospital setting makes it unpleasant to watch (the patients are odd, obviously, and the doctors are even worse, which I guess is the movie's main point). There is a bit more action at the end and a ""big reveal,"" but overall nothing that would justify the rave reviews.
I would suggest watching other great Milos Forman movies instead such as Amadeus, Man on the Moon, Hair...",1504742400,,446,4.5875

89381,3,0790732181,"Great book, but this movie missed or changed almost everything that made the book so profound. It's desperately lacking the Chief's narration and critical plot information. The first scene ruined it for me with Taber mouthing off and all the men laughing and being rowdy, like they hadn't been emasculated by Nurse Ratched at all, which is in stark contrast to the book where they were terrified to even giggle.
I was looking forward to seeing how the movie portrayed Nurse Ratched's unbreakable smile and her tender, manipulative demeanor (which had even ripped the manhood and integrity from the doctors on the ward), but her villainous character never fully developed in the movie.
Maybe it's just because I watched this immediately after finishing the book, but this was a real let down for me. It's like they chose to keep out or change all of the best scenes from the book.",1497916800,,879,4.827814569536423

89386,3,0790732181,"The 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest by Milos Forman is rated as a 3 out of 5 stars based on characters, how closely it follows the book, and how good the ending is.
The movie depicts the characters very well. Chief, McMurphy and Nurse Ratched are exactly how I pictured them. Chief is very big and strong, but he is shy and afraid to speak. McMurphy is strong minded and manipulative, but he likes to argue if he doesnt get his way. Nurse Ratched is not a nice lady. She likes to degrade the patients and have control of everything. The characters in the movie are very close to the same as they are in the book.
The movie follows the book for the most part, but there are some parts that are left out. In the book, Cheswick dies in the pool. In the movie, Cheswick is a key character the whole time. Also, instead of McMurphy talking to one of the other patients (the lifeguard) in the pool, he talks to one of the black boys. All these events, led up to a very climactic ending.
The ending of both the book and the movie were relatively the same. McMurphy and Chief got sent up to disturbed because they fought with the black boys. McMurphy snapped and tried to strangle the nurse, and then he go a lobotomy. Once McMurphy came back down to the ward, Chief smothered him with a pillow and killed him. To end the scene, Chief picked up the control panel and broke free. The ending is very good, and it sums up the movie very well.
Overall the movie is decent, but it is not what I expected it to be. I believe that for the most part it sums up the book, but it should include the key parts that are in the book. I would give this movie a 3 out of 5 star rating.",1495584000,,1671,4.113149847094801
89387,4,0790732181,I thought that OFOTCN was a very good movie and book. Some parts were left out of the movie but I spose they could not show certain parts. I was very surprised that In the end Chief picked up that cabinet and smashed through the window.,1495584000,,236,4.1521739130434785

I (am) back then a veteran of the Vietnam War, a hippy, a 3rd year art student from PAFA in Philadelphia, an environmental-ist late of Earth Day 1970, and a novice lay Buddhist who wanted more than any one thing in the world for everyone and everything in this world, myself included, to be freed from their, or its, suffering.

I was so moved, so blown to pieces by this story I stayed for a 2nd show. Both times it received a raucous, standing ovation at its end after the chief threw the monster wash basin though the window and made his escape. Great city, New York. Great story. One of the best ever put to film. Lots of tears and cheers from everyone.",1477094400,,737,4.153846153846154

You won't be sorry that you did.  The acting by Jack Nicholson and Louis Fletcher who plays nurse Ratchet is from another planet.. Extremely good.  Louise Fletcher plays the part so good that you walk away hating this woman who treats the patients so bad it seems.  You will fall in love with the Big Indian and others as you see a glimpse of what it is like inside of a mental hospital ward.  You will also see inside the minds of what others call crazy people when in reality they are no more crazy than you or I.  This is a classic movie that has stood the test of time.  It is a movie about the realities of life and how it changes us all.  The movie will change you .... no doubt..... A great one to see.",1476057600,,881,4.011494252873563

I was certainly older than in my twenties before I ran into a sinister and thoroughly evil Rached personality. The sad thing is that there are way too many people just like this character, and there are way too many people who are completely cowed by such evil and who spend their lives in Ratched's contrived Hell.

I fully expected McMurphy to proposition her with a remark like ""MIldred, you sorely need your buns banged,"" it was a logical development, but it never happened. The most admirable character is ""Chief,"" the stolidly loyal, quiet Indian who is befriended by McMurphy. I did not like the novel.",1469750400,7,580,5.052083333333333

McMurphy is Ahab.
Chief Bromden is Ishmael. Ahab: ""Hold; while Prometheus is about it, I'll order a complete man after a desirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest modelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to 'em, to stay in one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at all, brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and let me see - shall I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light on top of his head to illuminate inwards. There, take the order, and away.""
Nurse Ratched is Maya, the goddess of illusion, playing the role of the White Whale, reifying the universe.
The ocean is consciousness.
The movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is based on a book based on Moby-Dick, which is an instruction manual for breaking out of prison.
Visual aid: McMurphy's boxer shorts: ""The shorts under his work pants are coal black satin covered with big white whales with red eyes. He grins when he sees I'm looking at the shorts. 'From a co-ed at Oregon State, Chief, a Literary major.' He snaps the elastic with his thumb. 'She gave them to me because she said I was a symbol.'""",1464566400,,1220,4.5

The story revolves around Jack Nicholson's character who manages to get himself placed in a mental ward to get out of the work details of regular prison. There in the mental ward he runs into a manipulative nurse who is making the ward patients life hell. He rallies the patients and brings them out of their shell and meanwhile plays a contest of wits with the head nurse.

89613,5,0790732181,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) is the third film I saw by the legendary Czech New Wave director Milos Forman.  However, this is the first one I saw he made it in the states, specifically the state of Oregon.  The film is today considered by critics and the public in general as a classic and an American cinematic achievement.

Jack Nicholson starts as R.P. McMurphy-- a Veteran/vagabond card gambler with a criminal record of rape and battery charges.  He is described as a slacker who is faking mental illness in order to escape imprisonment. The year is 1962, McMurphy gets admitted to a Salem Mental Institute for an observation.  Soon after, he gains the trust of the patients and changes their lives...as a result of his shenanigans, he gets on the bad side of the strict and tyrannical senior nurse on the staff by the name of Ratched.

The film contains many hidden messages about life, sanity, institutionalization, and perhaps the meaning behind society.",1455494400,2,972,4.825301204819277

Heartwarming, yet disturbing at the same time, this movie depicts the human spirit, even if not in a sound state of mind. It's the actors that make this movie good; it's light on atmosphere and the plot is on the thin side, but great acting anchors this. Jack Nicholson cemented his growing legacy with back to back gems (this movie and Chinatown), and would only get more opportunities in the upcoming decades. Louise Fletcher is magnetic in her role as an authoritative nurse. The special features disc has a bunch of great stuff as well.

Fundamentally, the film had great cinematography, a phenomenally adapted screenplay, great acting, good soundtrack, and an overall great plot. The film was intriguing all the way through, with it's great exposition, numerous conflicts, and a memorable resolution. A great film professor once told me that every scene in a movie either needs to move a story forward or introduce some sort of intricate layer to a character. In One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, there was no wasted scene. Every scene made you love or hate someone more, perhaps change the way you feel about a character, or moved the story closer to it's resolution.

89778,5,0790732181,"""One flew East, one flew West,
And one flew over the cuckoo's nest.""

""Five Easy Pieces,"" ""Carnal Knowledge,"" ""The Last Detail,"" and ""Chinatown"" had already made Jack Nicholson a star.  ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" made him a superstar.  Now, to do further justice to a genuine classic, Warner Bros. make the movie available in a new, high-definition Blu-ray box set they call the ""Ultimate Collector's Edition.""  While the picture and sound qualities appear to be the same as in the previous Blu-ray Book edition, at least we can be thankful for the additional bonus items the studio now offers in the new set.

The easy interpretation of Ken Kesey's popular 1962 counterculture novel, upon which producers later based the stage play and the Oscar-winning movie, is to say that only crazies are able to see the world clearly.  However, the book's protagonist, Randall Patrick McMurphy, is not crazy.  Like Paul Newman's ""Cool Hand Luke,"" McMurphy is an emblem of determined individualism in a world of conformity, a symbol of people's capacity to overcome odds and accomplish whatever goals they set for themselves no matter what the circumstances.  McMurphy shows people how to stand up for themselves and be themselves, and the story in its various guises has been an inspiration for several generations of dedicated fans.

Michael Douglas brought ""Cuckoo's Nest"" to the screen in 1975 after a long and inexplicably arduous battle to get it made.  Douglas's father, Kirk, obtained the rights to the novel in the early 1960's and starred in a stage adaptation by Dale Wasserman, but the actor could never get a studio interested in producing it.  His son took over trying to get it to the screen in the early 1970's, finally succeeding (by which time his father had grown too old, or too obstreperous, for the main role).  Even given that Wasserman's play was altered considerably by Douglas and that the eventual screenplay gutted Kesey's novel of its point of view, changing it from Chief Bromden's to McMurphy's, the movie's history is remarkably saddening when you consider the sheer quantity of junk that finds its way into motion-picture theaters every year.  I mean, Kesey's story should have been a natural for the rebellious nature of young moviegoers in the 60's and early 70's, but Hollywood must have thought a nuthouse setting was too far outside the norm for its mainstream audiences.  It makes you wonder if Hollywood itself isn't being run by the inmates of the asylum.

Anyway, the younger Douglas found his financing in Saul Zaentz, the head of Fantasy Records in Berkeley, CA.  Together, Douglas and Zaentz spotted their director in Milos Forman, the Czechoslovakian filmmaker whose ""Fireman's Ball"" caught their attention for its sharp-edged humor.  Zaentz and Forman would collaborate again on ""Amadeus"" a few years later and share their second Academy Award for Best Picture.

The main character in ""Cuckoo's Nest"" is R.P. McMurphy, a boisterous, at first a self-absorbed roustabout serving time for antisocial behavior, fighting, and statutory rape.  But it occurs to McMurphy that he might be able to get out of doing hard labor by pretending to be crazy and being sent to a relatively cushy mental institution for ""observation and evaluation.""  The movie, set in 1963, begins with his admittance to the hospital and moves on through his experiences with the patients there and his eventual endeavors to get them to help themselves.

His nemesis at the hospital is the hard-nosed, self-assured Nurse Mildred Ratched.  She's the authority figure, more important than the head of the institution because she directly controls the conduct and activity of the patients on her floor.  And that includes McMurphy, who finds her exacting regime demeaning, depriving the men on her ward of their very souls.  The plot becomes a battle of wills between the tyrannical Big Nurse and the free-spirited McMurphy, with McMurphy betting the other patients that he can eventually get under her skin and make her lose her cool.

From the outset the filmmakers agreed they wanted only the best possible actors for the movie's characters, rather than big-name stars.  Director Forman says on the disc's accompanying documentary that he always wanted Jack Nicholson for the character of McMurphy, the actor having impressed him after he saw his energetic performance in ""The Last Detail.""  The filmmakers also discussed the possibility of Gene Hackman as McMurphy, Hackman having recently made an impression in ""The French Connection.""  In any case, Nicholson, initially unavailable, got the job, and he proved the perfect combination of extroverted rabble rouser, con artist, and sympathetic motivator the movie needed.  Likewise, the filmmakers made an inspired decision to use Louise Fletcher as the frigid Nurse Ratched.  Like Nicholson, she was not the only choice for the part, but she brings to the role an icy calm that makes her presence all the more threatening and her evil all the more insidious.

Also from the beginning director Forman wanted actors who looked as distinctly different from one another as possible.  He has said he doesn't like to watch movies where an actor enters the story, goes away for a while, and when he returns you've forgotten who he is.  Consequently, for supporting roles Forman chose relatively unknown actors with unusual physical makeups, most of whom we now know well.  There's Danny DeVito as Martini, Sydney Lassick as Cheswick, Christopher Lloyd as Taber, Vincent Schiavelli as Fredrickson, and in pivotal roles William Redfield as Harding and Brad Dourif as Billy Bibbit.  Finally, Scatman Crothers plays the night orderly, Turkle, and Will Sampson plays the huge Native American, Chief Bromden.  In the novel, the Chief narrated the story, but the movie relegates him to a lesser job, that of trusted friend to McMurphy, a change that infuriated the book's author, Ken Kesey.

For the sake of authenticity, the filmmakers chose to shoot the entire movie on location in a real mental institution, the Oregon State Hospital being the only one they could find that would allow them the privilege.  For an added note of authenticity, Dr. Dean R. Brooks, the head of the real hospital, plays Dr. John Spivey, the head of the fictional one.  Furthermore, the filmmakers insisted that all the actors spend as much time as possible with the real patients at the institution, and that they try to remain in character even away from the camera.  Obviously, the hard work and dedication paid off.

The book, the play, and the movie have all been accused over the years of misogyny, a hatred of or disrespect for women, which seems a little unfair.  The story focuses on a group of men living together under trying circumstances, so we might expect for all practical purposes that they would often refer to women as sexual objects.  And most films center on a male as the bad guy, so it only seems fair that an occasional film like this one use a female as the antagonist.  Besides, there are still more female nurses in the world, and symbolically the female authority figure is a convenient representation of the matriarch against whom the boys rebel.

Critics have also denounced the story for portraying a drunken libertine, McMurphy, as a hero and portraying a woman doing her job, Nurse Ratched, as a villain.  But Kesey never intended McMurphy to be a hero; he's an antihero in the best possible sense, just as Nurse Ratched is no ordinary heavy.  McMurphy can't help himself, whether acting selfishly or selflessly, because he's basically a good man with bad faults.  Likewise, the cold-blooded Nurse Ratched is a good woman who believes firmly that what she's doing is in her patients' best interest, oblivious to their real needs, something like the totalitarian societies she symbolizes.  She would never admit to the evil lying within her icy self.

Among the highlights of the film, look for sequences involving the World Series, a fishing trip, a basketball game, electroshock therapy, a climactic Christmas party, and a heart-wrenching finale, all tied together by Jack Nitzsche's haunting musical score.  ""Cuckoo's Nest"" is a terrific piece of moviemaking--thoughtful, poignant, funny, and uplifting.

Video:
In this new Ultimate Collector's Edition, Warner Bros. offer the movie on a dual-layer BD50 rather than a BD25 as they did for the earlier Blu-ray Book edition, again using a VC-1, 1080p transfer taken from a digital master created from restored elements.  However, the actual video encode appears to be the same, WB using the extra space on the BD50 for additional bonus documentaries.

Anyway, you'll find no lines, scratches, or age marks here.  Yet, despite this, given that director Foreman filmed entirely on location and went for as realistic a style as he could get, the WB video engineers probably didn't have the absolute best video with which to work.  For the high-definition Blu-ray transfer the video engineers seem to have tried to mitigate the film's slightly grainy appearance, and in the process they may have softened the picture a little too much.  In comparing the BD image a few years ago with an upscaled image from WB's latest DVD mastering, I found that in scene after scene, I had difficulty telling many of them apart.  In medium and long shots, the Blu-ray had a distinct advantage in clarity and object delineation, but in facial close-ups, the grainier standard-def picture appeared to have as much or more detail, the BD being a bit smoothed over.

What we get on the Blu-ray disc, then, is a picture quality that varies from crystal clear and razor sharp to somewhat soft and blurred, almost from shot to shot.  Fortunately, colors remain fairly natural, and there is nothing that cries out as desperately bad.  Still, as I say, the source material may not have always been the best, even cleaned up.

Audio:
Now here's the thing about the audio:  Even though Warner Bros. now offer a bigger slate of language choices, they still give us only a regular, lossy, Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack on the disc.  I have no idea why they chose to release an ""Ultimate Edition"" and not provide lossless DTS-HD Master Audio or Dolby TrueHD sound.  Maybe because the soundtrack has little to do, being about ninety-five percent dialogue, WB figured it was pointless to offer it in a lossless format.  Film studios move in mysterious ways.

In any case, the Dolby Digital 5.1 continues to deliver a reasonably decent sound, widely dispersed in the front channels, with good transient impact.  Note, however, that the filmmakers shot almost entirely on location, and just as the video sometimes differs in quality, so can the sonics differ from scene to scene, the indoor audio often sounding constricted, nasal, pinched, and even muffled, revealing the aural limitations of the actual hospital rooms used throughout the production.  Whenever the musical track kicks in, the stereo spread increases dramatically and the sound stage opens up, but there is still never much information directed toward the rear speakers except in the isolated case of a helicopter fly-by.

Extras:
I reviewed the ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" Blu-ray box set, which may or may not still be available. In any case, for it Warners carried over many of the extras from their earlier Two-Disc Special Edition DVD and Blu-ray Book sets, and they add a ton of peripheral items to the mix.  First, on the disc itself, there's an excellent audio commentary by director Milos Forman and producers Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz.  Next, there's an eighty-seven-minute documentary, ""Completely Cuckoo,"" that includes interviews with almost everybody associated with the making of the film.  (The Blu-ray Book contains only an abbreviated version.)  Then, there is another, briefer documentary, ""Asylum:  Empty Nest for the Mentally Ill,"" that includes recent interviews with Dr. Dean Brooks, the real-life hospital administrator who played the head of the institution in the movie, and Michael Douglas, who co-produced the film.  After that, there are eight additional, deleted scenes and a theatrical trailer.

The extras on the disc conclude with thirty-three scene selections; English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Spanish, Turkish, and other spoken languages; French, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and other subtitles; and English and German captions for the hearing impaired.

In addition to the Blu-ray disc, the ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" box contains a fifty-two page commemorative hardbound book, filled with pictures and text; a reproduction of the original press book; a deck of playing cards with McMurphy's picture on the back and characters from the film on the face (if you were hoping for the girlie cards McMurphy used in the movie, no such luck); four small reproductions of original theatrical posters; and a whole collection of photo cards.

Lastly, for those of you with limited shelf space wondering if you have to make room for the big box, the disc itself comes in its own foldout cardboard container, a kind of Digipak, that you can place on your shelf if you haven't room for the box.

Parting Thoughts:
For a motion picture that no studio wanted to produce, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" did all right for itself.  Not only did it become one of the top box-office attractions of 1975, it swept all five of the most important Oscars of the year, winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Nicholson), Best Actress (Fletcher), Best Director (Forman), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman).  Finally getting the film made was as much a triumph over adversity as McMurphy's selfless final decision in the story.  It's an all-around great show, and for the ultimate collector, the ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" ain't a bad deal, either.",1434326400,4,13941,5.097228332600088

Louise Fletcher couldn't have been more right for her role as the infamous Nurse Mildred Ratched; spectacular villainous portrayal throughout.

89895,5,0790732181,"With an insane asylum standing in for everyday society, Milos Forman's 1975 film adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a comically sharp indictment of the Establishment urge to conform. It features Jack Nicholson. The film was the second to win all five major Academy Awards (Best Picture, Actor in Lead Role, Actress in Lead Role, Director, and Screenplay) following It Happened One Night in 1934, an accomplishment not repeated until 1991 by The Silence of the Lambs.

Playing crazy to avoid prison work detail, manic free spirit Randle P. McMurphy is sent to the state mental hospital for evaluation. There he encounters a motley crew of mostly voluntary inmates, including cowed mama's boy Billy and silent Native American Chief Bromden, presided over by the icy Nurse Ratched. Ratched and McMurphy recognize that each is the other's worst enemy: an authority figure who equates sanity with correct behavior, and a misfit who is charismatic enough to dismantle the system simply by living as he pleases. McMurphy proceeds to instigate group insurrections large and small, ranging from a restorative basketball game to an unfettered afternoon boat trip and a tragic after-hours party with hookers and booze. Nurse Ratched, however, has the machinery of power on her side to ensure that McMurphy will not defeat her. Still, McMurphy's message to live free or die is ultimately not lost on one inmate, revealing that escape is still possible even from the most oppressive conditions.

Viewed more than 30 years after its release, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest remains a very good motion picture compared to present movies. Jack Nicholson stars in an outstanding characterization of Ken Kesey's asylum anti-hero, McMurphy, and Milos Forman's direction of a superbly-cast film is equally meritorious and a cinema masterpiece. The on screen battle between Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher serves as a personal microcosm of the culture wars of the 1970s -- and testament to the director's vision that the film retains its power more than three decades later. What makes it memorable after so many years is that it remains a marvel of contemporary filmmaking due to its intelligence, entertainment value, and themes such as pondering on life, manhood, and how society can be much scarier than nurses in white coats. A classic indeed.",1419638400,,2362,5.1484375

89924,3,0790732181,"This movie was gripping from the beginning - all of the main characters had intriguing stories, Jack Nicholson's performance was award-worthy (even if he tends to play the same role in each film he's in), and I looked forward to seeing how the character of Nurse Ratchett would develop (on the DVD case, she is described as being ""among the most coldly monstrous villains in film history.""

I watched the film to its conclusion, and by then, my feelings toward it had changed.  I understand that the film is attempting to portray a message of rebelling against authority, one of the underdogs' struggle to prove that they are more than what their label says about them.  However, this theme was not well-developed enough to leave a lasting impression upon the viewer.  The main character raped a fifteen year old girl, a fact that cannot be ignored, no matter how ""saintly"" his actions in the rest of the film are.  On the other hand, Nurse Ratchett never actually does anything unjust.  As much as I wanted to buy into the idea that she is a monster, I feel like she treated all of the mental patients with respect, and only issued punishments that were deserved.  I don't think that she deserved her treatment at the hands of Jack Nicholson's character (especially in their last scene together); while I felt almost for it, I couldn't help thinking to myself, ""Why is this poor woman being treated so awfully?""  (Having read others' reviews, it seems to me that in the book, the character of Nurse Ratchett is significantly more evil than the film's version of the character.  It's a shame that the director chose to ignore that for his adaptation)

The first part of this film showed great potential and was very entertaining.  However, most of the interest I had in it had eroded by the time the final scenes arrived.  I would recommend this film, but I would stress that it is not as great as others would have you believe.",1416528000,,1928,4.654867256637168

89984,5,0790732181,"After so many years after I watched Milos Forman movie, I finally read Ken Kesey's book (originally published in 1962). I did like it a lot, and I found the movie actually to be very much based on the novel, almost literally. The novel is told from the point of view of Chief Bromden (actor Will Sampson on the movie). This particular edition is a Deluxe Edition from Penguin including a foreword by Chcuck Palahniuk, an introduction by Robert Faggen, and most importantly, sketches by Ken Kesey all over the book (he writes a short introduction about this as well). If you already have this book already, the old edition, I find the sketches to be absolutely worth buying this book again.

Milos Forman brought to live an excellent story and created a masterpiece of a movie. Filmed on location at the  Oregon State Mental Hospital - 2600 Center Street NE, Salem, Oregon, USA, and starred by Jack Nicholson (Randle McMurphy) in perhaps the most brilliant act of his whole career (which is saying a lot), the movie surpasses the movie in my humble opinion. I stated above teh movie is very much following the book. However, the main difference between the movie and the book is that the movie is not told from the point of view of Chief, but Randle McMurphy's. The movie was the hit of 1976, taking BEST MOVIE at the Academy Awards (Oscar) and Best Actor for Nicholson, Best Actress for Louise Fletcher, Best Director for Milos Forman, Best Adapted Screenplay for Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman. By the way, did you know that Ken Kesey NEVER watched Milo's Forman movie of his acclaimed book? Hard to believe, but true.

Finally, Jack Nitzsche's soundtrack, which is very good, although not great. It lost in the Academy Awards against John William's Jaws. The soundtrack is kind of short (about 30 minutes), and it is, like the book, told from the perspective of Chief. Thus, the several Indian musical elements. Although not great, I still enjoy listening to it very much, specially the opening and closing credits, which really transports you to the ward and the minds of the Acutes.

In conclusion:
Book: 4 stars
Movie: 5 stars
Soundtrack: 3.5 stars.",1407024000,2,2154,4.751336898395722

90010,5,0790732181,"I cannot think of any actor more perfectly cast than Jack Nicholson as Randle P McMurphy--he was BORN to play this part, pure and simple!!

 McMurphy is a rebel--he has no use for authority--he brawls and gets into trouble--in short, he's not an upstanding citizen and, in fact, is a little bit dangerous. BUT.....McMurphy has a magnetic charm, a devilish grin, and a mischievous spirit which endears him to all the patients in the ward. Ask yourself--doesn't the description of McMurphy fit Jack Nicholson down to a tee?!!! I truly believe this is why he's so perfect in this part and why his performance is so unforgettable!!

 However--as iconic as Nicholson's performance is--he's supported by an incredible ensemble. And it's not just Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched----Brad Dourif is heartbreakingly vulnerable as Billy Bibbit--Sydney Lassick is equally heartbreaking as Cheswick and William Redfeld also gives a standout performance as Harding. The interactions between McMurphy, Nurse Ratched, and the mental patients on the ward are some of the greatest acting you'll ever see on film!! It's just an incredibly powerful story that is elevated further by the superb cast!!

 This is a titanic drama that every person should see at least once in their lifetime. Once you have seen it it'll always stay with you!!",1400284800,,1320,5.144859813084112

I truly enjoyed the movie's simplistic approach to mental illness as it had no interest in being about insanity. It is about a free spirit in a closed system. Nurse Ratched, who is so inflexible, so unseeing, so blandly sure she is right, goes to such a radical extreme, and McMurphy is the Huck Finn who wants to break loose from her version of civilization.
Jack Nicholson as McMurphy takes the patients at face value, treats their illnesses as choices that can be reversed, and tries by sheer force of will to bust them loose into a taste of freedom. I also enjoyed watching this aspect of the movie as I believe each person has free will and the freedom of choice.

I was reading an article that was discussing the problems of our current mental health treatment in America and its history.  The article referenced this movie so I was intrigued.  The message from the movie left me emotionally stirred, saddened while at the same time pleased that someone made it out.  The human experience affects everyone differently, just depends on the circumstances.  I think about the article I read that stated something like, no one ever gets better with mental health, and actually, as a society we probably make it worse.  I think the fact that Jack's character's demise represents that but that the ""big guy"" emerging from his shell represented hope, as result of the human experience.

Nicholson really does a great job, along with the entire cast.  You should also do some research on the film before it made its debut in Hollywood.  It was on Broadway and really has quit a history.

It keeps the viewer interested the entire movie---I just can't say enough. I might not say it would be alright for someone very young to watch--it is a grown up movie. However, well...just watch it.

In this film he shines again in a role that pits him against a merciless psychiatric nurse in a mental institution.

90144,4,0790732181,"This may have been the best Jack Nicholson movie I've seen, he's great as acting crazy/insane, so a movie about him being placed in a mental institution had to be very interesting. The boat stealing scene was cool because the other patients there never got any kind of treatment, just pills to keep them at bay, McMurphy (Nicholson) did more for them in that one afternoon than the Institution had done their entire stay.
  Every scene between McMurphy and Chief was gold, their chemistry was amazing. The way they interacted and the more about Chief that was revealed made me wish the movie wasn't over yet. Will Sampson almost stole the show for me. There are some familiar faces in here too like a young Danny DeVito and Christopher Llyod. I don't think there's any way someone could come away from this movie feeling they've wasted their time.",1388361600,,847,4.716216216216216

90150,5,0790732181,"There are not a lot of movies that look as good today as they did back in the 1970's. Many movies that have centered on ""youth culture"" and rebellion - ""Easy Rider"", ""Five Easy Pieces"", ""Two-Lane Blacktop"", ""Billy Jack"" - have become dated and will be seen by today's eyes as unusual. But ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" stands out because it took the rebellious spirit of youth and merged them together with themes of courage, stubbornness, idealism, pride, inspiration, oppression, potency and friendship, themes considered cliche in the 1970's, to make a movie that has stood the test of time. Brilliantly directed by the underrated Milos Forman, ""Cuckoo's Nest"" pits wise-ass rebel Randle P. McMurphy against the oppressive Nurse Ratched in a psychological, emotional and eventual physical battle in a mental hospital.

Alternatively comical, tragic and life-affirming, ""Cuckoo's Nest"" can be read as many things---the battle of idealism against tyranny; an allegory of hippies against Nixon-era figures; a clash between warm, loose sentiment against cold, unemotional intellect; and a Freudian comedy of humane potency against mechanical flaw. But whatever the interpretation, ""Cuckoo's Nest"" remains an uncommonly powerful cinematic experience that stimulates the mind and touches the heart. With Haskell Wexler as the cinematographer, Forman turns the mental institution into a repressive cage of cuckoos that are never set free: the claustrophobic corridors, dead atmosphere, square-shaped windows and cells and eerie use of pleasant classical music makes it even more palpable.

The performances are generally excellent, from the obligatory Jack Nicholson as Randle McMurphy to Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif and Danny Devito as the mental patients that McMurphy inspires. Louise Fletcher is a walking brick wall as Nurse Ratched, whose subtle but menacing methods on her patients prove that villains don't need to make world domination speeches and kill puppies to be evil. Forman has a good eye for detail and an exceptional skill for actors, as demonstrated here and in ""Amadeus"" and ""The Fireman's Ball"" and it is unfortunate that his talents are no recognized. My guess is that through the passage of time, his movies and talents will become standards that movies and film directors will be judged against.

Speaking of Jack Nicholson, if there was one movie that turned him into a larger-than-life figure, it would be ""Cuckoo's Nest"". Nicholson was a struggling actor who achieved respectability with his dramatic roles in ""Five Easy Pieces"" and ""Chinatown"". But he also had a flair for comedy, as seen in ""Easy Rider"", the chicken salad sequence in ""Five Easy Pieces"" and, of course, the comedy classic ""The Last Detail"". With Randle McMurphy, Nicholson completely fulfilled his promise as a great actor in the making, expressing his talents in portraying both wild (and subtle) comedy and dramatic bravado. Rather he's angering Nurse Ratched by imagining that he is watching TV, taking his fellow patients out fishing on a boat or gradually revealing his rage when Ratched leads one of the patients to kill himself, Nicholson is a force on screen. Even if Nicholson never made movies afterwards, ""Cuckoo's Nest"" would still confirm his status as one of the greatest actors of all time.

Perhaps it was wise that Forman made many changes from the original source material. Ken Kesey, who wrote the original 1962 novel, resented the movie because it gave the narration to Randle McMurphy instead of Chief Bromden. I have read the book many times during my high school years and while the novel is intriguing to read, the film adaptation is a lot smoother, less didactic and completely free from the emotional detachment and dense symbolism that marred the book (ex. the Combine and the portion where suddenly we find out that Randle already knew that Bromden was feigning his deafness). When you adapt a novel into the film, you've got to compress details and make changes, but as long as it respects the spirit of the book, the movie will turn out fine. And ""Cuckoo's Nest"" not only turned out fine, but the film adaptation is now considerably more well-known than the book version. Maybe Kesey does have a right to be mad after all.

""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is truly one of American cinema's greatest treasures. And the Blu-Ray version will ensure its immortality for many generations to come.

The author relates the making of this movie, and it added an interesting dimension to it.  The movie was shot in a real institution with a few actual patients on the cast.  One patient found the experience so beneficial, he was released the day the filming wrapped.  The crew shot daily, all day on a locked ward.  Using Method acting, Nicholson and others kept their parts throughout the filming.  Added to some stories on casting and cast interaction, I enjoyed the movie even more than I had in the past.

Whether you are fresh to the film, or an old fan, the story never loses its luster and the film is a triumph of acting, directing, and editing.  With or without new background notes, this movie is always worth a viewing.",1387670400,,820,4.645833333333333

90222,3,0790732181,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was a groundbreaking film. The performances are top-notch. Although it does have an incredible amount of language and subtitle options the picture and audio quality are fairly average in this release. The same bonus features found on previous releases are included along with the documentary only seen on the Limited Edition laserdisc. There is over 2 hours of total bonus content. This is a 4 star film in a 3 star package. The Blu-ray is still the best version to own but the film could use a decent remastering for its next release. Although it is pricey, this film has retained its value well.

Well, I highly recommend watching ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" to find the answer to that question.

My family and I sat around the living room, (this includes my mom, dad, sister, and me), and we all enjoyed the movie. We absolutely loved the cast and were fascinated by some of the procedures and treatment that could take place in a 1960's mental hospital.

If I had one complaint, my sister did say that it ran a little slow at some points. But this should only be a bother for younger children. It was an amazing movie and I would recommend it to anyone!

Our Hero (Jack Nicholson) is a prisoner that may (or may not) be trying to get out of his work detail by pretending to crazy.  However, when a sane man tries to live with insane friends, he's a bit blown away by the reactions they have.  He's constantly butting heads with the head nurse, a woman who refuses to take his bait, and the manhandling interns are all wise to what he's up to.  So some things happen, and by the end, an odd movie that at times feels like its going nowhere becomes great.  Along the say, check out a REALLY young Danny DeVito, Christopher Llyod, and maybe even learn what a few movie references you never got were about.",1371686400,,828,4.248407643312102

I had some time to kill and had the DVD from the bargain rack so I sat down and was blown away.  The acting is superb, the story is riveting without the mandatory explosions and chases of movies today and probably would never have been made if it were being suggested now.

I want my review to address the people, like me, who just didn't think it would be something they would like.  All I can say is this movie instantly went to my top 5 movies of all time.  You will be glued to the set to find out what happens while all the time having some idea already.  Just be ready for a true drama, without any of the fluff of a movie today.

90375,5,0790732181,"This is a wonderful film from the 70s that has such an intriguing conflict between Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher. There have been many chilling villains but Nurse Ratched was arguably the most heartless and cold of them all. She makes this a true battle for supremacy. Nicholson is supported very nicely by the rest of the cast who he helps to rile up. Originally adapted from the novel by Ken Kesey, the film tells the story of a criminal interned in a mental hospital where he interacts with many people. Jack Nicholson plays this Randle McMurphy who goes in ready to live easy and challenge authority. As he grows accustomed to the institution he becomes the instigator of the other patients and he tries to make them question authority too. However he must deal with Nurse Ratched, a cold and iron-fisted woman who keeps everyone at bay. Not even McMurphy seems able to prevail over Rached and her tactics in the end. However his new found friend, Chief is able to escape and keep the hope alive after saying his last goodbyes to Randle.

90413,5,0790732181,"My late-night, bargain-rack movie for yesterday was ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" starring Jack Nicholson. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. My reasons for choosing it were two-fold. One, I like Jack Nicholson, and 2, I remembered it as a highly acclaimed movie back in the 70s. The movie was excellent. Well worth watching!

The movie had a real simple setting, and seemed like a stage play. About 3/4 of it took place in an Oregon mental hospital. In addition, there are a couple short excursions outside the hospital. Jack Nicholson was the only known star at the time of filming. That was a choice. All of the other actors (roughly 20 people) were unknowns who played mostly patients and administration people and support help in a mental hospital. The main set was an actual Oregon mental hospital and the actors portrayed people who they had met there and studied. The acting was excellent and gave the story an eery realism. It was one of those ""you-are-there"" types of movies.

The movie was highly touted when it came out in the 70s. It was a time of reform of mental institutions and this movie brought a lot of attention to the situation. But, in addition the story (originally a play) was highly regarded and the realism and acting in the film resulted in five Academy Awards including Best Picture. Well, they were awards that you can look back on and say that they got it right. Everything about the picture is first rate. I was delighted to view it.

90431,5,0790732181,"Nothing really to add to my fellow reviewers' assessments of the movie's merits-- which are abundant and worthy of repeated praise-- but for those interested in the correct contents of this excellent box set (Amazon lists as extra features 'none'), they are as follows:

- Commentary by director Milos Forman and producers Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz, and a theatrical trailer, both of which appear on the 2002 two-disc DVD and all current Blu-ray releases.

- Deleted scenes, which appear on Blu-ray.

- New 87-min. documentary, 'Completely Cuckoo,' which can be found here and on the Collector's Edition Blu-ray. This is essentially an expanded version of the 47-min. documentary put out with the two-disc DVD, recut with input from novelist Ken Kesey (who was notably absent from the earlier piece).

- New interview with Michael Douglas, again common only to the Collector's DVD and Blu-ray.

- Transfer looks to be the same as that taken from the 2001 restoration and is, contrary to Amazon's claim of a 1.33:1 aspect ratio, anamorphic widescreen.

- Also included are a hardbound book filled with extensive production notes, stills and behind-the-scenes photographs; a reproduction of the original pressbook; lobby cards featuring poster artwork; character photo cards; and a deck of cast-inspired playing cards.

While certain of the components here are superfluous (playing cards, I'm looking at you), it is a very attractive package for completists, and for those who agree that 'Cuckoo,' as a unique and valued contribution to American cinema, deserves the royal treatment. 5 stars for the film, 4 1/2 for presentation.",1361491200,5,1633,5.257692307692308

I remember our high school English teacher had us read some pretty dynamic books back in the 70's and this was one of them. I don't know if it's as widely assigned by teachers in this day and age.
Later I saw the movie and read the book again, appreciating what a good novel it is, and perhaps understanding where it was coming from and its influences a little better than I did in High School. Of course the book is better than the movie, but the movie is very good in its own right. Now we have the movie on bluray disc.
I don't imagine anybody needs a description of the films plot and most people buying this would be well familiar with it. But in case you hadn't: a brief no spoiler summary would be that the movie is about a mental ward and a rebellious patient/leader who appears on the ward, nurse Ratched who runs the ward is perturbed by him, he rails against authority and stirs things up (in some ways the Mcmurphy character in this film is similar to the character of Luke in ""Cool hand Luke""). Nicholson and Fletcher are great in the lead roles and most of the supporting cast went on to wider notoriety. The movie is both funny and tragic, it has qualities that are rarely seen in mainstream cinema today.
Warner Brothers has done a fantastic job on this Bluray release. The image quality is excellent, and the packaging with booklet essay, photos, and supplements make it a real collector's item. Recommended.",1358899200,,1467,4.437037037037037

90475,5,0790732181,"I had the pleasure of finally watching this classic starring Jack Nicholson, and I can't believe its taken so long to get around to it. The film has been a staple on the IMDb top 250, lingering near the top (it's at #12 at the time of this article) for as long as I can remember, so its a wonder why I haven't set aside time to check it out much sooner. On the other hand, there's a cool feeling about watching a classic film for the first time. We often watch great films and remember that feeling we had seeing it for the first time, wondering what it would feel like seeing it for the first time again. Watching classics long after their initial release is taking a journey into a different time and place, with often different philosophies on film making which makes it a whole different experience when compared to watching a new film.

The film stars the versatile Jack as McMurphy, a rebellious misfit who gets sent to a mental institution after previously serving at a prison work camp. In no time McMurphy brings his brand of breaking-the-rules fun to the other patients. For most, he does far more than what the medical practitioners can, treating them as regulars and showing them to a good time. Needless to say he gains a quick following with the patients, but is under the close eye of the facilities authorities, mainly the head nurse, Nurse Ratched.

The film focuses on one thing impeccably: characters. The colorful bunch of patients are more than just looneys talking to themselves. They each have their own story and distinct personality. Many scenes involve the characters simply interacting, whether it be during a group therapy session or a game of cards. Their personalities show through every line and every action they're involved in. This is one thing that is so easy for films to overlook, as surprising as it would seem. It's easy to get wrapped up in the plot and the action and put aside a character's past, feelings, and overall place in the big picture. Cuckoo's Nest places focus on the characters, which gives it an advantage in being a piece of humanity over a piece of entertainment.

Escaping the facility is only a small part of the movie. While that would seem McMurphy's original agenda, as the film goes on and he becomes closer to the inmates, it becomes much more philosophical. In fact, McMurphy has several chances to escape, which isn't really a spoiler. The film to me is really about how he changes during his stay at the hospital, and how he changes his new group of friends.

It became clear to me how this film has stood the test of time and is still considered one of the greatest films ever made. You don't often see a film today that takes place primarily in one location, nor one that places so much emphasis on characters and feelings rather than action-driven plots. It goes without saying that Jack Nicholson is one of the greatest actors of all time (he won an Oscar for his performance), and his moving performance here is only enhanced by the supporting cast. A film like this needs a strong cast to be pulled off, and there don't seem to be a lot of actors that can demand such attention as they do in this movie. While it certainly is tough to make an enjoyable film, its perhaps more difficult for a film such as this to keep the viewer's attention without being boring. That to me was the true test that this film passed, and I'd go as far to say it is unrivaled in that regard.

I can't discuss this film without mentioning the very surprising ending. While I found it to be quite sad, it had very poetic and mystical feeling to it. In the big picture though, it fit the rest of the film and really added an extra level of mental perplexity. The ending is just yet another aspect that sets it apart from other movies. When it could go one way that might please the audience more, it takes a different direction that is more in line with the rest of the film. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a real exemplary piece of film that illustrates that while times have changed, our humanity has not.

90476,4,0790732181,"Seeing this film again for the first time in a number of years was very eye-opening. I always remembered Jack Nicholson's McMurphy character as being just another one of those personalities that was more an extension of the actor than a character in a story. But seeing it again, I admit I was very wrong. Nicholson gives an exceptional acting performance in this film. And more than just being another eccentric loner, McMurphy develops into a man who watches out for the inmates of the mental hospital and tries to get them their dignity back. This film is very riveting.

The Blu-ray presentation is very good (I'd give it about a 4 out of 5 for picture quality). It's soft at times but that has a lot to do with the quality of the original movie, which was shot on a limited budget. There is also a documentary (in standard definition) on the making of the film that runs about 45 minutes, featuring interviews past and present with director Milos Forman, producers Michael Douglas and Saul Zaentz, several of the actors who got their break with this film (including Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd), and others involved in the filmmaking process. The only major person absent from the proceedings is Jack Nicholson.

The disc also contains several cut scenes and the trailer, plus commentary by Forman, Douglas and Zaentz.

I chose to view the movie because it had particular value in centering on multiple characters experiencing multiple disabilities.  Most were emotional or psychological in nature and in the film all were exacerbated by a system of treatment that was as inflexible as it was self-righteous.

McMurphy enters the ward with a borderline personality disorder or perhaps just a disdain for most social norms (the viewer is left to interpret and guess).  He seemingly is just biding his time and messing with those in charge until he realizes that they can keep him there past his prison sentence.  Unable to simply do what he is told he tries to bring down the inflexible Nurse Ratched and her inflexible approach to treating the patients.

90502,5,0790732181,"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975) is a film you'll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it a few times when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn't `get' a lot of the insights the film conveys. Viewing it again recently, I `got' it.

Set in the early 60s, the story involves R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the ""mental illness"" card to get out of prison time, thinking it'll be a piece of cake, but he's wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy's ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.

The movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their ""therapy"" is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (at the taxpayer's expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be ""dealt with.""

A lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched ""isn't that bad"" or that ""she was only trying to do her job"", etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film's brilliance: Ratched's malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she's authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is absolutely demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.

The filmmakers and Fletcher make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare this to, say, Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Joan Crawford in ""Mommie Dearest,"" which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn't such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif).

McMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he's impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.

Nurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That's because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (or rule). The problem with this is that ""appearances"" are not about reality and, worse, ""the letter kills.""

Despite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a decade. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, yet only those who deserve it - the humble - not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you'll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end of the film because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it requires mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren't any good people in such institutions, of course).

No review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of Chief, played effectively by Will Sampson.

The film runs 2 hours and 13 minutes.

90510,4,0790732181,"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" takes place in a state hospital just prior to the deinstitutionalization movement in the 1960s.  The main character is R.P. McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson.

 McMurphy is brought to the hospital in handcuffs.  In his intake interview with Dr. Spivey, the ward doctor, he is initially polite and seems normal.  Dr. Spivey reviews his history of belligerent behavior.  McMurphy is a criminal with five arrests for assault, and a more recent charge of statuary rape.  At the prison farm, he was rebellious and lazy, and has now been sent to the state hospital to determine if he is mentally ill. McMurphy shows no remorse and makes light of his behavior.  For instance, when asked about the rape, he claims that the girl was sixteen and told him she was eighteen, that she was eager for sex, and that any man would have done the same as he did.

 Although McMurphy claims that there is nothing really wrong with him, he is kept at the state hospital and placed under Nurse Ratchard's authority.  Nurse Ratchard is a grim woman who keeps strict control of the eighteen men on her ward.  There are voluntary patients who pass their days by smoking and playing cards, and more severely disabled patients who live in their own worlds.  None of the men have any real control over their lives, and no one seems to have much chance of getting any better.  Indeed no one seems to care very much if they get better or not.

 The treatment given consists of medications and group therapy sessions led by Nurse Ratchard, whose version of therapy has more in common with police interrogation than the client-centered therapy envisioned by Rogers.  Nurse Ratchard grills the patients about their personal problems and makes them more anxious and insecure than before.  Most of them are obviously terrified of her, and she seems to like it that way.  Yet McMurphy continually challenges her authority and refuses to be intimidated.  He uses his powers of persuasion and manipulation to lead the other men against her.  First he calls for a vote on watching the World Series (contrary to the usual routine) and later he steals a bus and takes the other men on an unauthorized deep sea fishing trip upon a stolen boat.  He seems to think that there will be no consequences for his behavior because he is already in a mental institution.  However, when he and two other patients fight with the ward orderlies, all three are given electroshock therapy as a punishment - a blatent violation of their rights.  Again, McMurphy makes light of it and assures everyone that he has not been subdued.

 After learning that the institution has the power to hold him indefinitely, McMurphy plans an escape with a friend.  However, he wants to perform one more act of defiance before leaving the hospital.  He sneaks in women and alcohol and throws a huge party for the other men.  During the wild night, he passes out from drinking and misses his chance to escape before Nurse Ratchard comes in the morning.  She is furious when she discovers what has happened and takes it out on young Billy Bibbit, an anxious and sometimes suicidal patient who has always been easy for her to manipulate.  Unable to handle her harsh attack, Billy kills himself.  Enraged, McMurphy turns on Nurse Ratchard and chokes her.  A male nurse intervenes before she dies, but her neck is injured, requiring a brace.  McMurphy is then removed to another ward where he is subjected to a lobotomy that leaves him in a vegetative state.  When returned to Nurse Ratchard's ward in that condition, his grieved friend quietly suffocates him and then carries out the escape plan that McMurphy had devised for the two of them.

  The adversarial relationship between McMurphy and Ratchard was harmful to both of them and to the others around them.  If only someone had intervened before things turned tragic!  Perhaps with a more understanding nurse and more respectful treatment, McMurphy could have used his influence over the other patients in a positive way.",1346716800,,4036,4.801161103047895
90531,5,0790732181,"The mid-1970s was a tremendous era for movies, with youngish film directors able to make bold personal statements thanks to a studio system that was not nearly as rigid as in previous generations. Unfortunately, that time would not last, but the result is that today we enjoy a time in which a very healthy ""indie"" environment helps shape popular tastes.

I spent a lot of time in movie theaters back then, watching what in retrospect amounts to blockbuster after blockbuster -- ""Jaws,"" ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" the first ""Rocky"" (which, people might forget, was a superb film) and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.""

I was 14 when it came out, and had not even read Ken Kesey's novel yet. I went to see it, and was so moved I went back and saw it next week. After that, I read the book. After that, I read Kesey's ""Sometimes a Great Notion."" For awhile back then, Ken Kesey was my fictive universe.

I've recently revisited all that stuff, and also viewed Paul Newman's adaptation of ""Notion,"" which isn't easy to find. (I think I rented it on Netflix.)

One of the differences between mere entertainment and true art is that art not only holds up but seems to deepen over time. And Milos Forman's film adaptation of ""Cuckoo's Nest"" has done just that. The movie basically swept the Academy Awards the year after its release, but come on ... is it really that good?

Acting: Check. Not only Oscar winners Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched and Jack Nicholson as R.P. McMurphy, but the entire cast, which included William Redfield, Brad Dourif, Danny De Vito and Christopher Lloyd.

Directing: Check. Forman had directed nine films prior to this one, but was still relatively unknown. I think it could be argued that his helming of ""Nest"" was a turning point in his career -- he would go on, after this, to direct ""Ragtime,"" ""Amadeus,"" ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt,"" ""Man on the Moon"" and ""The Ghost of Munich."" His Academy Award for best director of ""Nest"" was well-deserved.

Adapted screenplay: Check, with some reservations. Bo Goldman and Laurence Hauben did make some changes that did not sit well with fans of Kesey's novel, including, apparently, the author himself. One common complaint was that the focus shifted from Chief Bromden to McMurphy himself. I can see this point; Bromden narrated the book, and it is his voice and his evolution as a character that drives the book. But doing the film that way would've been very ... artificial. Bromden was, we'll recall, pretending to be a deaf mute to fool the staff at the mental hospital into basically leaving him alone. Framing the film that way would have required a voice-over, and in this case such a device would've just gotten in the way of the storytelling.

Best Picutre: Was it? Here was the incredible competition that year: ""Barry Lyndon,"" ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" ""Jaws"" and ""Nashville""!! Double exclamation point indeed! Rarely has there been a year with so many worthy BP nominations. ANY of these films would have been a worthy choice for best picture. I am a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick, but I think ""Cuckoo's Nest"" was a better film than ""Barry Lyndon."" ""Dog Day"" was basically a thriller with several social messages, while ""Jaws"" and ""Nashville"" were probably the most purely entertaining. But ""Cuckoo's Nest"" won, and few could argue it was less worthy than the others.

Bottom line: If you've never seen this film, DO SO. And if you can, get the two-disc version and watch all the extras. The story of this film is nearly as fascinating as the film itself. I won't spoil that story arc, but will just say it took a lot of time, effort and some false starts to get this fine film made.",1344816000,,3671,4.705607476635514

90535,5,0790732181,"I think this is one of the most significant movies of the 1970s. Very, very funny in parts, but heartbreaking, too. And Jack Nicholson is perfect in the role of McMurphy, who managed to get himself transferred from the jail to the mental hospital because he thought it would be easier. Guess again.

The special feature material on this two-disc set helps explain why it was so very accurate. And take it from someone who has been on both sides of the keys in mental hospitals (worked in one as one of my first jobs; patient in several during my wicked hippie days), it is quite authentic. It was filmed in a real state hospital (Oregon, I think), and the actors spent a good bit of time there before they started to shoot. Also, the director was smart enough to let them ad-lib and adjust their lines and the stage direction to what they had observed of real patients in the hospital.

Louise Fletcher, who plays Big Nurse, is just exactly the right combination of smarmy sweet and undertone of hard steel to accurately portray the sort of people who rise to positions of responsibility in such an institution. She is 100% control freak. She also knows how to twist everything to make it sound like it's the patients doing it to themselves. You want to call her evil, but you know she probably does believe that this is what is best for the patients.

One scene that will live forever is the group session in which McMurphy discovers that all of the other patients on the ward are voluntary commitments who could leave any time they wanted. His shock at this is so heartbreaking, and he plays it perfectly.

My favorite character is Chief, the huge native American who goes from a very convincing catatonia to McMurphy's rescuer. But don't expect a rescue scene like McMurphy has been planning. Life is too complicated for that.",1337558400,2,1829,4.601226993865031

90539,5,0790732181,"This classic is just as riveting and superb as it was when first released in 1975.  ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a cinematic triumph and a powerful allegory about the machinations of the Establishment, otherwise known as Authority.  In this film Authority is personified by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who calmly yet firmly intimidates and terrorizes her charges into submission.  And her charges?  None other than patients in a mental asylum, with most of them living there voluntarily, preferring Ratched's predictable and strict rules than taking their chances in the unpredictable outside world.  Accordingly, when Authority is challenged, and challenged effectively, first the other patients welcome the rebellion--and then Authority lashes back, and does whatever is needed to control and suppress the environment.  But there are consequences; at least one patient is influenced enough to strike out on his own, culminating in a euphoric victory over the status quo.

Of course the challenge to Authority is none other than Randall Patrick McMurphy, a slick con faking insanity to avoid actual prison and hard labor.  This character is the glue that holds everything else together, and Jack Nicholson is stellar as McMurphy, playing him with a comedic edge that is captivating.  Yet the entire cast is exceptional--and utterly believable--from Fletcher to Christopher Lloyd to Brad Dourif to Danny DeVito to Will Sampson to the rest of the ensemble.  This movie doesn't feel like a movie--it feels like a documentary depicting a mental ward as it's manipulated by a nurse, then counter-manipulated by one man.  The inherent rebellion against rigid Authority is timeless, making ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST poignant and meaningful then, now, and forever.

Drama, 133 minutes
Directed by Milos Forman

Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors and he can pull off anything from serious drama, to horror, or even comedy. I loved his portrayal of Melvin Udall in As Good as It Gets, but I think R. P. McMurphy is my favorite Nicholson character.

McMurphy is placed in a mental institution for evaluation, but he's really just trying to avoid prison and hard work. We know that he's faking it the whole time. His fellow patients are a weird mixture of oddballs. Some are dangerous, others merely insecure. McMurphy discovers that most of the patients are there on a voluntary basis and he observes that they are no crazier than the average person on the street.

There's a great scene when McMurphy arranges a road trip of sorts and we see how some of the others function when they are in the real world. It does raise an interesting point about mental illness. How much is a result of our environment? Can some of the problems be remedied simply by being placed in the right environment?

The characters have plenty of depth and we gradually learn some of their hopes and fears. The best moment in the entire film involves Juicy Fruit, but I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen the film. If you have, you'll know exactly what I mean.

McMurphy is perceived as subversive and potentially dangerous. When Nurse Ratched (Fletcher) refuses to show the World Series on TV, McMurphy whips the other patients into a frenzy by acting out an imaginary game.

The acting talent on display is seriously good. You can see early performances from the likes of Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito, as well as Brad Dourif's breakout performance as Billy.

The film contains a lot of humor as Nicholson pushes his role to the limit, but there are sad and frightening moments included in the mix. The mood can turn from peaceful to chaotic in the blink of an eye, and reflects the true nature of mental illness. The ending is particularly moving and can be considered both hopeful and desperately sad.

According to IMDB, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest became the first film in 41 years to sweep the major categories of Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director and Best (Adapted) Screenplay. The accolades were thoroughly deserved.",1331078400,2,2419,4.756563245823389

Jack plays a likeable fellow and finds ways to do things like take them out of the institution for an afternoon boat ride. The authorities at the institution become sorely tired of his unruliness and the distress he causes, but Jack's influences have worn off. Albeit, too late for Jack.

The clever screen play provides laughs intended to provoke the establishment--a favorite pastime of the 1970's. The dialogue between inmates is excellent. Can't be beat.

90559,3,0790732181,"I'm either a racist, or an intelligent, racially aware, with-it white guy (you decide). For me, the enduring image One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest brings to mind is that of white patients being lorded over by their caretakers: women and people of color. They don't just line up on separate sides of the basketball court, they are literally fighting each other throughout the film.

The exception to this is Chief Bromden's and R.P. McMurphy's friendship. The Chief is played by Will Sampson. His mental illness makes the original story hard to follow. The Chief is the one who escapes at the end while native american music plays accompanying the credits. Is this enough to make the film acceptable or politically correct? Or is the film simply ahead of it's time - we're supposed to link Native American's and their tribulations with the later day dispossession of whites and so feel a kinship of sorts? The problem with this is that the ancestors of R.P McMurphy are the ones who dispossessed Native Americans, and Will Sampson is only a Native American actor reading a line. Will Sampson seems such a natural fit for Chief Bromden, I do wonder if Ken Kasey had Will Sampson in mind when he wrote the book? I wonder if somehow the idea for the film preceded the book.

I wonder if McMurphy is intended to be an everyman in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest? In one scene the Chief tells McMurphy, ""I seen the bottle work on him (my father)"" Then he adds cryptically, ""Just like they are working on you now."" Later in the film McMurphy is subjected to shock treatment and then finally lobotomized. This is done simply as a means to punish, and as a means to control the subject. Earlier in the film, it is revealed the prison doctor believes McMurphy is faking his mental illness. 'I believe you're a malingerer' he tells McMurphy. I'm not sure McMurphy's lobotomy in the film is meant to be an allusion to something else, but a reviewer on my friend's list claims the American public has been subjected to 'a kind of 'self-inflicted lobotomy'. Perhaps it forms a fitting image.

Most of the film takes place in the mental ward. They did a wonderful job using contrasts of light and shadow to make the film visually appealing. I have to give this film a mixed review, however. To me, it seems as though the film quietly promotes counter-culture values? As I noted a 'lobotomy' earlier, and even as many reviewers applaud this film's celebration of individuality: one man against a cold institution or one man against the machine, men like R.P. McMurphy no longer exist in our society, at least not White men, except perhaps as a straw man, a ghost to be conjured up and then railed against. Men like the R.P McMurphy portrayed in this film no longer exist. The popular consensus might be (even as we applaud this film) 'good riddance'.",1317859200,,2834,4.652694610778443
90560,1,0790732181,"By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com

I saw this film years ago so my memory of the details are no doubt fuzzy but the impression the film made on me is indelible.

When we came out of the convention center, there was a theater showing One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest for $1.00 before five PM. It was then 4:45 PM so I said, ""I'm in the motion picture business and this film won five Academy Awards. Let's go in and see it."" What I remember:

Jack Nicholson is committed to a modern mental institution. He declares that he has been committed only for the ""F"" word and for fighting. Soon after his admittance the men on the ward are punished for smoking cigarettes and not allowed to watch the World Series on TV. Nicholson of course opposes such severe punishment - because the World Series means so much to the men.

Nicholson then decides what the men really need for their mental illness (in addition to cigarettes) is liquor, so he acquires cases of booze for the patients to have a wonderful time.

Nicholson has so many clever witty lines that he becomes lovable to those who admire defiant antisocial behavior. One reviewer described it well when he said it was a ""gut and soul-wrenching movie, with many moments of high maniacal comedy interspersed.""

There is very shy young man on the ward with a severe stuttering problem. Who else has the answer but Nicholson? He knows, without it being said, that the boy's stuttering must be coming from sexual repression; so Nicholson arranges (I don't remember how) for a prostitute to be brought onto the ward and they lock the women in the room all night with the boy who stutters. In the morning after spending the night with the prostitute, the boy's stuttering completely stops! He is now self assured, confident and speaks clearly.

When the head nurse learns about what had happened, she asks the boy, ""What would your mother think if she knew about what you have done?""  Immediately the boys stuttering returns and he becomes again the shy, pathetic, trembling person he was before. At that point in the film, many young men in the audience of the theater where I watched the film stood and screamed, ""KILL THE BITCH, KILL HER, KILL HER, KILL HER!"" Those words and the screaming, I will never forget! Makes me wonder what those boys will think of their own mothers who want them to be moral, and decent.

The film ends when a great big Indian smothers Nicholson (Crucifies the savior of the patients in the hospital and the savior of mental illness) with a pillow. The giant Indian then rips out a water cooler and with super human strength heaves the cooler through the bars and window of the hospital which he runs through to get away. I guess this was supposed to symbolize that patients in mental institutions need to break free from Cuckoo hospitals and from a repressive society that has made them mentally ill.

Jack Nicholson who was committed to the hospital for the ""F"" word and for fighting was the hero who ""flew over"" in the film because he was the only one who really understood the causes of mental illness. That's brilliant, isn't it? One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest that won 5 Academy Awards is about as Cuckoo as a film could get.

What did the film really teach? That mental illness is caused by a society that represses indulgence; and that mental health is achieved by satisfying all of our appetites, no matter how base or how carnal; and if anyone tries to dissuade us, be it a nurse, a teacher or a mother, they deserve to be killed!

Academy awards and 284 people giving this film a 5 star rating tells us how sick our society is. Read the comments for a confirmation of this.

90573,4,0790732181,"This movie was a very well directed movie.  The dialogue was simply brilliant, hilarious and was perfect.  Additionally, the acting was amazing.  The persons playing the asylum inhabitants are phenomenal actors and are exceptionally convincing.  While the movie was beyond brilliant it was a little slow for my own taste.  It should be noted that the end is absolutely brilliant, is phenomenal and is heartbreaking all at the same time and the movie's ultimate climax is brilliantly directed and perfectly acted.  I absolutely love that they decided to make Mac steal the bus rather than get permission as he does in the book, this was a genius change and it made the movie that much better!  The other way does not fit his character, and is not in the spirit of Mac!

The main character of this movie, Mac is absolutely awesome.  His personality is beyond entertaining and his commentary, attitude and beliefs are so spot on to reality.  He perfectly portrays a typical social misfit/criminal, who should have been in prison rather than in an asylum and who was misjudged by the very professionals and experts that were in charge.  Furthermore it should be noted that what makes the final conclusion so disturbing is that the doctor's themselves know what they are doing and know that he is not psychotic at all.

The plot of the movie follows a man who was transferred from a prison work farm to an insane asylum.  While at the asylum he becomes the ""leader"" of a group of socially awkward and mentally disturbed patients.  While at the asylum he teaches them all kinds of destructive habits and ultimately works to undermine and rebel against the authority of the iron fisted nurse Rachted.  His final act of disobedience is the most hilarious, most ingenious bit of acting, and social commentary ever imagined, but such is quickly followed by a series of absolutely heart-wrenching scenes, all culminating in a brilliant ending.

I really enjoyed this movie and I thought it was very well executed and acted.  Personally I took of one star because I found certain parts of it to be long and draggy giving me a ""hurry up and get this scene done already"" mentality.  Definitely get this movie, it is an absolute classic, you will not be disappointed.

The title warns you about this crazy movie. Miss Ratchet arrives at this hospital. ""Medication time."" Music plays, the patients line up. A car brings in a new inmate. He acts like a mental case. Dr. Spivey talks to him. Randall Patrick McMurphy is the new patient. Why was he sent there? ""I really don't know."" Five assaults, statutory rape. Was he faking his condition? We see the patients trying to function in a discussion group. [Does it drag here?] You can see their problems. [What is the point of all this?] Basketball? The patients are medicated. Who wants to watch the ""World Series""? Another therapy session, another vote. ""The meeting is adjourned."" McMurphy reports on the game. More trouble? McMurphy talks to the Doctors. [Is this a good sign?]

Can McMurphy make an escape in daylight? Yes, and he brings Candy to the boys. Next they take a boat ride. What will they catch fishing? Their trip comes to an end. Voluntary or committed? McMurphy's activities go on. He is given ""electroshock therapy"". [Did it ever do any good?] McMurphy continues to break the rules in defiance. [How did he survive on the outside?] The next morning Nurse Ratchet inspects the disorder. Where is Billy? Will Mac attack a nurse?

90603,5,0790732181,"What makes One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest one of the more amazing adaptations from book to film is the superb acting and the flawless job casting the roles. Having Jack Nicholson take on the role of McMurphy, a man who tries to get out his prison term by faking being crazy, was a brilliant move, as he epitomizes the snide, sarcastic, rebellious character. Also, there are exceptional jobs done by both Brad Doriff as Billie, one of the patients in the asylum, and Louise Fletcher as the soft spoken, but superior Nurse Ratched, who butts head with McMurphy. The film also features many well-known names and faces: Danny DeVito in his film debut, Christopher Lloyd, Will Sampson (as ""Chief"").

The film's main theme is antiestablishment and rebellion over authority, but still there is a human side to all of the mischeviousness. McMurphy realizes almost immediately after getting to the institution that things won't go as merrily and easy as he had planned, but is confident that he will break Nurse Ratched's will within a week, so much so that he offers a wager with some of the patients. McMurphy tries to rally the boys to have special privileges and to do things like watch the world series, and the crux of the film is about this battle between individual and authority. Along the way, he meets and gets to know many of the wards, and sees their problems up close. He befriends a silent, towering Native American man, Chief, who becomes an important character in the film's final resolution.
The film also explores what it means to be ""free."" Many of the wards, McMurphy comes to find out, do not have to be in the institution, but are there voluntarily, perhaps so they don't have to face the outside world. McMurphy's sense of freedom--which is to do and say whatever he wants-- is constantly being impeded and prevented by Nurse Ratched. In a critical point in the film, the Chief sees this freedom being crushed, and must decide what to do.

I loved the two disc set, which also offers a documentary that looks at the making of the film, so this definitely is the one to get (I mention this because Amazon lumps all versions of the film together in one review).

I remember seeing this movie back in a film studies class, and it was fantastic to watch it again. It has humor and wit, but also pathos and tragedy. It is a great film, and worthy of the many accolades it took home that year.",1301788800,,2403,4.596736596736597
90604,5,0790732181,"the previous reviewers have mostly said all there was to be said about this
great film and i do agree with most of them. the movie doesnt let go all throughout
and i was glued to my seat reveling in the awesome acting of the entire cast, starting with the always great danny de vito, christopher lloyd (the actor who'd give us some of the looniest performances in Back to the Future and Who framed roger Rabbit), up to the otherworldly showdown between nicholson and the glacial
almost satanic louise fletcher, with her hair aptly combed to vaguely resemble
curved horns.
you forget that mc murphy (nicholson) is a petty criminal who's avoiding hard labor in some prison, when you see him injecting life back into the heavily sedated ward patients. thanks to mc murphy, those patients whose brains were wrecked with powerful drugs and were never meant to be cured, get back to appreciating life, playing ball, fishing and having an identity. a truly memorable part is when nicholson tells a card playing inmate to wait his turn: 'you see these people here? they are all REAL people'
and again during the fishing trip, he assigns to them specific jobs by telling them jockingly that 'now you're an expert sailor, not a loonie'.
little by little, those patients start having back a taste of life, and one starts to question the means employed by mental institutions: there are many alternatives
to brain melting drugs to mental cases and these alternatives include the very basic
forms of entertainment, play, friendship and giving purpose back to the treated person.
for me the whole movie culminates into one of the last scenes where nurse ratched
busts the stuttering bibbit with candy: bibbit's stutter is gone during the night he spent with candy and he was again a normal person, with confidence. he was cured, by a very simple 'method', yet the nurse proceeds to destroy his newly found confidence by clubbing him with guilt. mc murphy is horrified at the true evil on display, as he sees the man he helped shed his stutter and lack of confidence, dismantled back into wimpdom. i found myself cheering for him when he leaped at nurse ratched's throat.
the concepts displayed in this movie are timeless ones (leadership, play&humor,
conformity, individualism) and are played to perfection by a stellar cast. the result is
a film that defies age and a permanent reference in hollywood's golden era cinema

""Cuckoo's Nest"" grossed over $112 million (in 1975 dollars).

SYNOPSIS--
Randle McMurphy is sent from state prison to a psych hospital for evaluation. When he bets with other patients that he can ""put a bee in Nurse Ratched's bonnet,"" McMurphy isn't aware that his misbehavior may doom him to be held indefinitely and far beyond the term of his prison sentence. Although there are several comical moments in this story, there's far more dramatic and ultimately tragic ones, including scenes of such ""therapies"" as restraints, shock treatment and lobotomy.

The cast, many of whom are relative newcomers, is a brilliant one. Kudos to Brad Dourif in his second film, as the tragic Billy Bibbit and to 6' 4"" Creek Indian, Will Sampson as the ""deaf & dumb"" Chief Bromden. This is the sort of movie that bears up well to repeated viewings and is one that belongs in every serious video collector's home library.

When he bets with other patients that he can ""put a bee in Nurse Ratched's bonnet,"" McMurphy isn't aware that his misbehavior may doom him to be held indefinitely and far beyond the term of his prison sentence. Although there are several comical moments in this story, there's far more dramatic and ultimately tragic ones, including scenes of such ""therapies"" as restraints, shock treatment and lobotomy.

The cast, many of whom are relative newcomers, is a brilliant one. Kudos to Brad Dourif in his second film, as the tragic Billy Bibbit and to 6' 4"" Creek Indian, Will Sampson as the ""deaf & dumb"" Chief Bromden. This is the sort of movie that bears up well to repeated viewings and is one that belongs in every serious video collector's home library.

The collector's edition has some nice goodies:  a 52 page hard-bound book, reproduction of the original press book, a 52 card deck, 4 mini-reproduction of the original worldwide theatrical posters and 6 cast/character photos.

90624,5,0790732181,"This movie is as relevant now as it was when it first hit movie theaters in the 70's. Hilarious, somewhat dark and thought provoking. Great performances all around, anyone I recommend this film to loves it. You will remember most of these characters, right down to Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito in supporting roles. In my opinion, one of the most uproariously funny moments in movie history occurs when Chezaroo flips out about Nurse Ratched's stingy cigarette policy.

The Blu ray transfer of this movie is excellent. It is not the very best of the best, but for a film that came out in the mid-seventies it has superb PQ on Blu ray.",1280534400,29,639,4.654867256637168

Of course life isn't that straightforward but that's the essence of what I take away from ""Cuckoo's Nest"".  Once your authentic self is awakened you can't choose another's definition of yourself anymore though.  It's hard not to relate this 1975 movie to Hitler's Germany, or shoot, even things that are happening in 2010.

Director Milos Foreman put together an excellent ensemble cast of archetypes with Nurse Rached representing the status quo, McMurphy the rebel, and Chief the voiceless Everyman.  All the other patients and warders serve as the Greek Chorus.",1280188800,,739,4.959349593495935

""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is about a man (R.P. McMurphy) who is transfered to a mental institution, for testing to determine if he is ""insane"" or not. McMurphy, who is no more then a rebel goes through many obsticles and adventures during the film that are very funny, and yet some serious and sad.
""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is very deserving of the best-picture award it won in 1975 along with other awards won.

90641,5,0790732181,"So I watched this gem of a two-disc special edition last night and loved it more than the first time I viewed it probably five years ago. Apparently it managed to sweep all five major Academy Awards in 1975 (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay) and was very well deserved.

A crook manages to get off a work farm and sent to a mental institution for evaluation. R.P. McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson endeavors to shake things up around the ward and show the men there that they aren't nearly as crazy as they think they are. Some of his shananigans include gambling, watching a fake world series game, hi-jacking a bus with inmates on it to go fishing, and sneaking girls and booze into the ward at night. When he discovers that antagonizing Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher, could get him committed and only permit him to leave on her time instead of his own, he decides to plan an escape. The constant battle for control on the ward is very entertaining and at times heart breaking.

Jack Nicholson's energy and improvised antics never fail to entertain and engage your attention throughout. When he isn't performing for the others, he manages to be quite an sympathetic fellow trying to better the lives of people around him through his crude techniques. The Nurse is amazingly calm, strict, and has a never-ending tact for digging to the core of the patients' defenses to maintain control and keep them miserably docile. She rarely raises her voice and yet it's obvious she doesn't need to in order to get people to listen to her.

The supporting cast is also amazing featuring Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd among others. They deviate back and forth from being vacant, hysterical, and occasionally have sane moments that make them very human. In particular, the Chief (Will Sampson) who has convinced everyone that he is deaf and dumb goes on a journey back to communication and the real world with McMurphy's help. The ending is happy and tragic all at the same time, but I won't say why for those of you who haven't gotten to view it yet. I very highly recommend it, and this DVD is a great edition.

DVD Extras:

The restored picture really makes a big difference in viewing. The Behind-the-Scenes documentary is very interesting talking about the time period, the themes from the book, the casting, and the time members of the crew spent at a similar facility to prepare for their roles and how they refused to drop character during the shoot. The Cast/Director Career Highlights don't give you much more information than if you used IMDB, but the audio commentary by the director is again very interesting, though the documentary is better.",1266796800,,2711,4.784188034188034
90642,5,0790732181,One flew over the cuckoo's nest has always been one of my favoite movies and I am glad to have my own dvd so I can share it with my friends. Of course most any movie with Jack Nicholson is fun to watch.,1265932800,,202,3.7209302325581395
90643,5,0790732181,"The book was bad ass and the movie rang true to it.  Great acting, strange music and Jack's eyebrows.  Why wouldn;t it be good?",1263686400,,127,4.25
90644,4,0790732181,"Based upon the 1962 novel by Ken Kesey, the book, along with this great film, is said to be some kind of social commentary, being a clash of the establishment and rebellion.  Some people say that this movie is merely just a footnote of the times.  I disagree.  In 2009, I can watch this movie and understand it greatly, and I can still appreciate this movie's many little sayings on various human qualities (according to the reviewer, the novel is more trippy or something.  Beats me).  Oh, and it also has fun and freshness thanks to the many quirky characters (hey, it's a mental hospital!).

Unlike what other people say, I don't think this movie is really a product of it's time.  Such themes as sadism, supression, and other means of control are nothing new, things that are probably just human nature and happen all the time.  People who get great pleasure from controlling others who are inferior regarding mental strength is nothing exclusive to the early 60's.  Teachers these days sometimes do it to kids.  Roommates can do it to another roommate.  Observing others, and you will most definitely find many elements of human nature.  I agree with Jim Emerson in that the characters actions are all human nature, not just the mindset of it's times.

This also is a character study that I don't mind studying at all.  These kind of characters are quirky, totally likeable, with tons of traits that make you feel emotions for these characters portrayed on screen (being fictional, no less).  They do it with ease.  Randal McMurphy is a rebel who is likeable, and I feel that Nurse Ratched is a despicable human being, with no sympathy toward her.  These two central people fight for their own beliefs, and it's great to see Ratched's tryannical and slightly sadistic and cruel iron fist slowly go down in a vain attempt to stop the rebel.  Sidestepping the battle between the two, the rest of the ward is just as good, with the same kind of traits.  The Chief is a noble, interesting, and mysterious man who really makes an impression.  You can learn a lot more by reading the book on this character (since the book is narrated from his eyes).  I also find quite al iking for Billy on a particular note, simply because I feel it's just so bad to have a mother who prevents her son from liking women (what a life that must be).  His demise in particular makes you wince when you think about it.

I could go on and on, and while they don't feel like your friends or anything of that nature (I tend to only feel that way about Dazed and Confused), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest feels just like one of the classic stories where you love reading about them and the story, and don't feel like your falling victim to the 3rd person syndrome.

I also think the directing is very nice, as well as the music and visuals.  Sure, this isn't a highly stylized picture of any sorts, in fact, the grainy picture (thanks to the picture of the DVD and the movie's old print, I think) makes it seem kind of flat, almost documentary looking style.  However, while that's cool, the directing is top notch, effortlessy made.  However, I think what also makes the movie look special is what he captures.  I think this guy captures some great shots, and there's nothing more.  Oregon is a beautiful state (this whole movie is shot on site), and the scene where he breaks the inmates out of feels is as refreshing on screen as it would be in real life.  The music makes the movie even more better.  Especially a scene such as described works wonders, because the music is light, and beautifully captures the whole moment of it.  Easy to see why Milos Forman got an Academy Award for Best Director, his 1st out of his 2nd Academy Award (Amadeus).

I admit that I kind of beamed when I read ""Smashingly Effective, Emotionally Powerful"" from the late great Pauline Kael, hearing it from a critic such as that (she seems very opinionated and doesn't shower praise like some other critics).  I only thought the bad thing was the ending, which was good but not as good as the novel version.  While this movie may not quite live up to that, I feel that One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to still be a film that has q bit of everything, including humor, some tragedy, some social commentary, and a place with people you would probably want to visit more than once.  This is an entertaining and powerful movie worth seeing again and again.

90659,5,0790732181,"The 1970's were the best year for cinematic movie making; ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is one of the best films from that decade and has now gone down in history as being an all-time classic. This masterpiece is perfect in every sense of the word from the performances to the direction to the writing. ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is also one of those rare films that was nominated for every major Academy Award; it in turn won in all the top categories including being Best Picture of 1975.
 Jack Nicholson, in a flawless performance, plays a man signed into a mental hospital. His character, McMurphy, is not at all crazy, but he is put in this particular hospital to be evaluated after spending time on a state farm (jail). Once at the hospital McMurphy meets many patients as well as the rigid Nurse Ratchet. To say that McMurphy livens up the hospital as well as its inhibitants is an undersatement. The movie is hilarious, but at the same time touching as mental illness is explored in a humorous way.
 The DVD comes with a 47 minute documentary on the making of the film. Michael Douglas (one of the film's producers), Louise Fletcher, director Milos Forman, and others are all interviewed. Jack Nicholson, unfortunately, is not in the featurette. The film is a 2001 digital transfer from restored elements and there is a splendid commentary from Forman, Douglas, and Saul Zaentz. Subtitles are in English and French and the trailer is included.",1246924800,,1462,4.729411764705882
90660,2,0790732181,"Unfortunately for me, and probably for this review, I read the book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest before watching the film.

On one hand, most of the secondary actors are well-chosen. As another reviewer points out, Brad Dourif makes an excellent Billy Bibbit, as Sydney Lassick makes a good Cheswick and Will Sampson makes a perfect Chief Bromden.

But, on the other hand, almost every reviewer has argued that Forman made a good choice in choosing Nicholson and Fletcher. If I approached this film knowing nothing about the insane asylum, I might agree: Nicholson and Fletcher are generally superb. But, unfortunately, by the time I stuck the tape in my VHS player, Ken Kesey, the author of the novel, had described the characters for me. The novel's McMurphy is a strong, red-headed Irishman; Nicholson, although he identifies himself as Irish, is neither red-headed nor particular buff.

This is a minor complaint. Forman, however, takes liberties with McMurphy's dialogue, making it bear little resemblance to that in the novel. To some extent, of course, this is necessary when screening a novel. But, although bad language does not offend me, Nicholson uses the F-word, and even stronger language, at points in the film when McMurphy censors himself. Memorably, when in the novel Dr. Spivey asks McMurphy why he has been sent to Ratched's ward, he replies, ""It's probably because I drink and fu--sorry, ladies"" [paraphrase]. In the film, he goes right ahead and drops the F-bomb. This gives us a picture of McMurphy's character which is very different from what Kesey shows us. In the film, he seems more brazen and irrational. This detracts from Kesey's description of him as an essentially good and logical (though often greedy and self-interested) person.

Fletcher's acting as Big Nurse Ratched is even more incongruous. In the novel, she is described as an ugly hag with enormous breasts and androgynous clothing. The men joke about how unattractive she is, and McMurphy says that he would never be able to ""get it up"" for her. Fletcher, however, is a fairly attractive actor, and absurdly, Formen chooses to accentuate her beauty by putting her in a tight dress. My mom, who knew nothing about the plot, thought that the tense conversations between Ratched and McMurphy at the beginning of the film were supposed to be a prequel to a later love affair. From the very beginning of the novel, however, it is clear that this is impossible.

I must admit that I do not know how Formen ends the film, since my VHS player ate the tape half-way through the movie.

There are incongruities in the plot, however, even from the beginning. Significantly, McMurphy doesn't field the vote for the World Series Baseball Game until about half-way through the novel. This comes much earlier in Formen's film, and it does not seem only like a poor adaption, but also like a bad directorial decision to show McMurphy and the men celebrating an imaginary play like old pals about five minutes we have watched them meet.

Furthermore, after Nicholson hops the fence and steals a bus (which never happens in the book), they meet the prostitute, Candy. This happens about 45 minutes into the film. In the book, they meet her about 3/4 of the way to the end---she drives to the hospital (in a car) to take the men on a fishing trip. This change is huge.

Even from a purely filmatic perspective, McMurphy's theft of the bus seems out of context, considering the power Ratched is supposed to wield over her patients. McMurphy is empowered, and the hospital is simply his playground. One almost feels sorry for the poor, attractive Ms. Ratched, who attempts to keep her patients from doing such ridiculous, and obviously reprehensible things as escaping and stealing vehicles. In truly great films, such as Apocalypse Now, the interaction between the characters and their environment is far more realistic. A ""great American classic"" has none of these jarring inconsistencies.

The most frustrating of Formen's choices is his decision to tell the story from a third-person perspective of McMurphy. Of course, this allows for brash humor and nurse-bashing. But it omits the story's most powerful aspect, which is its narration through the eyes of Chief Bromden. In the novel, the Chief is a complex character, who often recalls his home on the Columbia River with his family, and the government's destruction of his hometown and his proud father. His intelligent commentary gives the novel a ""human"" dimension which places it among the exalted classics. We see how the Chief has fallen from a proud, self-sufficient man to a cowardly lunatic. Choosing to include at least some of his words, and not to omit or change the original dialogue completely, might have made this a more compelling and memorable film. It is not moving.

These may seem like minor complaints, considering that the film is an adaption, and adaptions are hard. But I indignantly feel that this should be a more carefully-crafted film, considering that it has won five Academy Awards and high praise.

In sum,

This is a film by Formen, not Kesey. It has more humor than pathos. Some of the characters are pretty and funny, not intriguing or accurate. Same with the scenes. Keep that in mind when you watch it.

NOTE: I meant to give this film three stars, but Amazon won't let me change my rating now that I have posted it. Sad.",1243987200,5,5389,4.895833333333333

An adaption of a 1962 novel by Ken Kesey, and filmed in the setting of the novel: Oregon State Hospital, this movie is not a love story or a romantic plot. Rather, this is a story of man's struggle in every society where dictatorship aborts dreams and dignities.
A recidivist criminal, McMurphy, is transferred to a mental insitution instead of prison. As his trick to spend an easier sentence, McMurphy(played by Jack Nicholson) thought he can leave any time he wishes since he's perfectly sane. The cast of the mental patients was perfectly picked to show a submissive group of people that most of them chose this life and chose being in this asylum.
I once read about a scientific experiment were researchers divided a large fish tank in half by putting a glass wall in the middle. A barracuda was put on one side of the tank and a mackerel on the other. The hungry barracuda tried to get the mackerel but smacked into the glass barrier. Again and again, the barracuda smacked the glass in its attempt to reach its dinner. Finally, realizing how futile its attempts were, the barracuda gave up. Researchers then removed the wall to see what would happen. Surprisingly, the barracuda made no new attempts to reach the mackerel. It eventually starved to death even though food was within easy reach.. The technical term for what happened is ""learned helplessness"". The barracuda had learned to be helpless from its many failed attempts to reach the other fish. When the barrier was removed, the barracuda continued to operate as if the glass wall was still there.
This Learned helplessness is the best term to describe the patients of the asylem depicted in the movie. A group of people that couldn't change any thing in their devestating lives and chose to be in a place were things were pre-chosen for them any way. McMurphy , the charismatic rebel by nature, tried to stand up to the main authority represented by a tyrant called Nurse Ratched played outstandingly by Louise Fletcher. The confrontations between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched started to by funny and silly but developed to be tragically fatal as McMurphy finds out that Ratched don't only have the authority to control the patients physically and mentally, but also the authority to keep him in the insititution for ever and even permanantly disable him.
The great acting will keep your heart ingaged while the story of a dream, friendship and the sense of belonging is being born among the guys. High prices are paid to reach a dream, but the dream will live while telling the story of:
Wire, briar, limber-lock

90679,2,0790732181,"This movie is an all-time classic because it retains its ability to entertain and to move its audience over the years.  It's been 30 years but this film ages very well as its theme of power corrupting and the triumph of the human will over tyranny, injustice and downright evil intentions is still relevant today.  Add that to brilliant acting by Nicholson in his best ever performance in a role that seems to have been written just for him as well as by Fletcher who is so good in her role as Nurse Ratched (""Wretched"")that she ranks among the top 10 of all time villainesses or bitches you'd love to stick a knife into.  This movie serves as a great metaphor for the triumph of the underdog over absolute power given to those who abuse it.  It was literally shocking for me to see (no pun intended) just how medieval and cruel ""treatment"" of the insane was (and hopefully not still is) in the 60s.  Released at about the time of the end of the Vietnam war this film would have struck a chord with audiences of the time experiencing something similar in trying to overcome injustices of the powers that be as symbolised by Nixon in how absolute power almost inevitably leads to corruption and the suffering of the true innocents.  This powerful movie will always be among my all-time favourites.

Unfortunately, this dvd version is very poor as the picture quality has many imperfections such as white spots having not been restored and barely rises above VHS quality.  The sound quality is also poor having not been remastered.  My advice is to give this version a miss and to wait for a well restored and remastered version with at least Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound options as well as good Special Features to surface either in the standard or in the new Blu-ray formats.  Surely a classic like this deserves a lot better than this poor quality dvd version.

Updated 27 June 2011: 4 stars

Amazon won't let me do a separate review for this and so I'll append this here: the digibook blu-ray version of this film is certainly worth the upgrade.  The picture quality while not pristine perfect is much, much better than the dvd version I reviewed above.  The iritating white spots and other film imperfections have been removed although grain does appear at a few points throughout the film but not overly so to complain too much about.  The sound quality is also a vast improvement over the dvd coming in Dolby HD 5.1 surround although truth be told most of the sound is heavily front loaded on the original master anyway and as this film is really mostly dialogue driven the lack of true surround is not too disturbing.

I read the book, and loved it, and I thought since the book and movie were different, that the movie would suck, that it would be pretty boring, but it suprised me big time.  It is entertaining as heck!  It's so funny, cool, and well written.  I was suprised to see how young Jack Nicholson was in this movie.  I also couldn't believe my eyes when I saw Christopher Loyd.  If you haven't seen this movie before, you have to.  It is a masterpiece.  Not only is it my favorite Nicholson movie, but it's my favorite 1975 movie, barley beating Jaws, not to say that Jaws is bad, I just like this better.  The acting is supurb, the characters are fun, the drama is convincing, and the best part of the movie is Jack Nicholson.

90688,4,0790732181,"While I commend the excellent acting of the main characters, I found the film to be boring. After an hour of Nicholson's antics and conflict with the hospital--enough already! The believability is poor. No wonder the novel's author sued. When the Chief is carrying the cabinet, he can barely walk and breathe. But the next shot shows it flying out the heavy-metal screened window like it was launched from a catapult. That action clearly made enough noise to awaken most of the hospital, yet we see many of the patients in that very ward slowly waking up due to other noise.",1220054400,2,574,4.693069306930693
90689,5,0790732181,"At one point in this movie that is one of the great classics of American films, McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) says of Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) that ""she likes a rigged game."" And does she ever. She will keep order and conformity at all costs and has to be one of the most despised characters in filmdom. Watching the sparks fly between her and Nicholson as the inmate who fakes mental illness to get sent from prison to a psychiatric hospital is a joy to behold. Both Fletcher and Nicholson, who has never been better in a role, received Oscars for their performances as did the director Milos Forman (""Amadeus""). The film, adapted from the Ken Kesey novel, won best picture as well.

From the opening credits to the closing horrifying scene, this movie holds you in its spellbinding clutches. I cannot recall as good a group of supporting actors as the psychiatric inmates. The are totally convincing and you almost believe that they are actual patients and not acting.

The film makes a compelling statement about the way we treat mental illness in this country as well as so-called professionals who refuse to listen to their patients.

While there are many moments here that will make your laugh, the last few minutes of the film are as dark as anything you will see. It is even better than I remembered.",1216512000,2,1311,4.691304347826087
90690,5,0790732181,"I am a big fan of this film.  I have seen it probably 60 times, in several different formats.  Without a doubt, the Blu-Ray release of this movie is the best looking, best sounding version ever produced.  And the Additional Footage extras that are included are amazing.  There are several great scenes that I cannot believe that they cut out of the final release of this movie.  The scene where the head of the 'hospital' asks McMurphy if he has ever abused a woman previously, I can understand why they cut out, because it would lead to an expectation of the resolution of the film.  However, all of the other Additional Footage scenes would have been GREAT additions to the movie.  My personal favorite of the Additional Footage scenes is the one entitled ""Mr. McMurphy, where are your clothes?""",1216512000,3,797,4.690647482014389
90691,5,0790732181,"The first time I saw this movie was on the big screen in '75.  At the time I wasn't very familiar with Jack Nicholson but after watching this I realized he was a cut above the rest of the actors in his field.  Everyone I knew had gone to see this film and not one person had disliked it.  Not sure if any film is perfect but if this one isn't, it's as close as it gets.",1214697600,,369,3.7662337662337664
90692,2,0790732181,"An underdeveloped story in almost every aspect, it establishes early on Jack Nicholson's character is going to shake up the humdrum lives of the mental inmates and staff, does a competent job of fleshing out this idea in a way that probably seemed more original back in 1975 (this may be sacrilege but I'd recommend watching 1990's Crazy People for a more engaging version of the same thing), and seems to not know where to go from there. The supporting characters barely have identities at all. The attempts to evoke sympathy for the inmates and contempt for the staff only appear in the second half of the film and seem to contradict the amicable relationship depicted previously. Then Jack gets into a fight (i can't even remember why), gets electroshocked (we aren't even shown the nurse giving the order, which would have gone a long way towards validating her supposed villain status), and nothing that happens from then on has anything to do with anything that happened previously. The film closes with the contextless unforeshadowed dramatic inserts of a tragic suicide and a noble euthanizing which made me think SOMEbody's been reading Of Mice And Men, and then a symbolic escape which is the most meaningless thing in the entire film.",1214179200,7,1245,4.9052132701421804

90694,5,0790732181,"I've seen OFOTCN a number of times over the years and it never fails to entertain, enlighten and work on a thinking mans conscious like few other films can. Many scenes are sad,tragic and disturbing and the battles waged by Nicholson's McMurphy role are often Quixotic and frustrating. In the end, I came out of this film with feelings of strength and power, as well as an understanding of authority and free will that I challenge and examine to this day.

McMurphy(Nicholson) is hardly a character anyone would like personally, forgiving maybe a quick conversation at a bar or a jobsite. McMurphy is jovial and quick with good natured BS, but is a petty crook, drinker, gambler and habitual loser. Sent from a prison work camp to a sanitarium for a brief evaluation, McMurphy locks heads witht the best player of the film, Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched. Methodical, calibrated and passive-aggressive, Nurse Ratched has made her the patients in her small therapy group obedient and broken their wills with a authoritarianism that is subtle and difficult to recognize. As the patients take their daily medication and ponder the hopelessness of their situations, Nurse Ratched coldly humilates her patients with her carefully regulated verbal tone and personality-free interactions.

The therapy group are some of the saddest men you'll see on film- their existense pointless and their therapy for the most part unproductive. McMurphy's arrival in the psych ward to these men is like a breath of Spring air. McMurphy challenges first the protocol of the unofficial leaders of the patients, the ""just-a-job-man"" orderlies that are quick to use unecessary force, and eventually the whole thought process and the psychological lack of liberty and thought pushed by Ratcheds policies.

Many saw this film in the 70's as a typical ""us against the Man"" screed, there's much more here. There are undertones that can appeal to many real life scenarios- the rituals of life we never question, our willingness to be lead instead of lead ourselves in times of question. Put your thinking cap on and see this one!",1212883200,,2101,5.066473988439307
90695,5,0790732181,"Jack Nicholson (Randle McMurphy) is the lead in this movie, though hardly the only great performer.  Louise Fletcher (Nurse Ratched) and Will Sampson (Chief Bromden) also provide outstanding performances.

McMurphy is sent to the mental institution for supposedly deranged behavior, initially is repelled by his fellow inmates, but then rallies to their defense as an anti-establishment reaction to Nurse Ratched's intimidation of them.  Even electroshock therapy doesn't stop McMurphy's antics.

However, after another patient kills himself worrying about Nurse Ratched telling his mother about his behavior, McMurphy tries to kill Ratched, and undergoes a lobotomy in retaliation.

The movie ends as Chief suffocates McMurphy so he can ""escape"" with him and throw off Nurse Ratched's control.",1212796800,,794,5.810344827586207

90698,5,0790732181,"This film profoundly moved me when I finally saw it, long after its 1975 release (while working at a place I won't name that reminded me a little too much of the institution in the film!).  It burns with the intensity of human struggle against oppression, showing how strong, how fragile, and how precious the spark of freedom and dignity is even in what might seem the most unlikely place for it, a mental institution.

Jack Nicholson, who won a well deserved Oscar for the role, plays a convict of mixed character who thinks he can game the system but gets in over his head.  His erratic behavior has gotten him transfered from a prison work farm to a mental hospital, which he appears to see as an easier place to serve his time.  Initially careless and arrogant in his dealing with both staff and patients, he comes to care about his fellow inmates, some there voluntarily.  Partly on their behalf he becomes locked into a battle of wills with the domineering, cold Nurse Ratched, who effectively controls the hospital (Louise Fletcher, who also won an Oscar for her role).  While much of the film plays as comedy, the overall frame is that of tragedy mixed with ambiguous victory.  It's easy to see political/social/philosophical context and implications, worth reflecting on, but the basic humanity of the story is central.

Besides the Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Actress, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Direction (Milos Forman), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman, from the novel by Ken Kesey).

The new Blu-ray DVD will carry the same special features as the SD Special Edition:

-- additional footage: McMurphy and Dr. Spivey, Chief Captured between Mops, Shaving Chief, Who's the Top Loony Here?, McMurphy Meets Nurse Ratched, First Group Therapy Session, A Bunch a Chickens at a Pecking Party, Mr. McMurphy, Where Are Your Clothes?

Hi def is always nice, but this isn't a film that requires high definition to be fully enjoyed, I think, and the SD Special Edition has good video and sound, so if you already have the Special Edition or can get it more cheaply than the Blu-ray, you might like it just about as well.

But this truly is one of the cinema greats that deserved all the Oscars that it won in '75, including Best Picture.  This movie put Jack Nicholson on the map with his first Oscar for best actor, for his portrayal of the ne'er-do-well infidel Randall P. McMurphy who gets sent to a nut house from the state work farm.  He teaches the people in the mental hospital how to play Black Jack, how to stand up for themselves, and immediately buts heads with the infamous villain of the story, Nurse Ratchett, played by Louise Fletcher in her Oscar winning performance.  Even though he tries to remain cool and aloof, McMurphy starts to bond with his fellow crazies, even the tall (deaf and dumb?) Indian called Chief.  McMurphy finds his own ways to help the other patients in ways that almost drive the staff into the nut house...and when he crosses the line with Nurse Ratchett, the disturbing consequences can be fatal to someone!  A deeply moving, stirring and sometimes disturbing story, this is one of the greatest movies in a raw and real portrayal of human struggle...serious, with an occasional dose of humor.  This is a stark and dark, but excellent movie, that also introduced audiences to actors like Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Scatman Crothers.

Little Does he know he is biting off more then he can chew as he soon becomes aquainted with his own personal hell, Nurse Ratchet played by Louise Fletcher.

The movie does not follow the book completly but does so enough not to lose any impact of any scene or plot line. A few minor changes here and there set the directors' view apart.

90718,5,0790732181,"Directed by Milos Forman and starring Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher, this is a 5-oscar-winning masterpiece and deservedly so. I first saw this picture in '76 and have watched it more times than is decent since, so much so I almost know the script by heart. Based on the novel by Ken Kesey and set in an Oregon mental institute, this tragicomedy is the single most profound drama I have ever seen and with a denouement so powerful and unforgettable I feel my life has been changed and enriched by the privilege of witnessing it. Whatever you think of Jack Nicholson, his performance here as R P McMurphy - a prison-dodging, sane-as-can-be sex offender confined for psychiatric assessment - is mesmerizing. As too are the performances of Louise Fletcher (Head Nurse Ratched) and a supporting ensemble of actors including Danny deVito, Christopher Lloyd, Will Sampson, William Redfield and Brad Dourif, all playing utterly convincing roles, indistinguishable - as I'm sure any psychiatric worker would vouch - from real-life mental patients.

 It is the ebullient McMurphy's disruption of the tranquility of the hospital ward that brings him into conflict with Ratched's stone-hearted, authoritarian matron. She runs a tight ship convinced it's for the benefit of the patients. Her idea of therapy is to have everyone sitting in a circle, ostensibly to benefit from discussion and to air their mundane issues, but with the main agenda of maintaining and reinforcing a despiriting regime of rigid conformity. These sessions often start morosely and silently but invariably end with raucous and hilarious shouting matches which are so perfectly and authentically played by the ensemble cast that you feel as though you're watching a documentary, but a riveting one at that. Here also we are introduced to some of the more vocal patients who though quirky and laden with issues, are generally more articulate and intelligent than those beyond the asylum. Outside of these lively discourses, the patients are kept subdued by daily dosages of drugs. Any hint of insurrection is quelled by fear of Ratched's excoriating disapproval and her arsenal of truncheon-wielding orderlies, disposed on her say-so to remove a patient by force to another ward where electroconvulsive therapy is meted out to the specially deserving.

R P McMurphy lands onto this lugubrious, ordered world like a fun-loving Martian. He is a boisterous, big-hearted, roguish extrovert and, once settled in, wins the confidence and in turn the admiration and hero worship of his fellow inmates. Excepting the ""chronics"", McMurphy can scarcely distinguish (and neither can we) between the patients and ""the average a**hole walking about out there on the street"". But the trouble begins when he bets with his fellow patients that he can, within a week, ""stick a bug so far up Nurse Ratched's a** she won't know whether to s**t or wind her wrist-watch."" This sets the scene for psychological warfare with, on the one side, McMurphy leading a bunch of fired up, newly assertive patients, and on the other, the system, or the ""Combine"", fronted by Nurse Ratched. The conflict comes to a head when McMurphy arranges a wild party for the patients to liven up their otherwise monotonous and colorless existences. However, it will be seen in the devastating and brutal consequences that the system deems itself having more to lose than those who would dare to confront it. Catering for individual aspirations and for patient happiness it seems were very far outside the remit of the mental healthcare system as it was. With undertones of Spartacus - possibly explaining Kirk Douglas' interest, whose son Michael brought the novel to the screen - this story brings into searing focus the cruelty and inhumanity of sectors of mental healthcare in sixties US.

Now to say further would be to give too much away. But believe me, this is a genuinely funny, bitterly tragic, remarkable, compelling, totally absorbing, emotionally draining and brilliant picture, so rightly deserving of its stature as one of the best films of all time - in this reviewer's opinion, the very best.",1198195200,,4130,5.123145400593472

90720,5,0790732181,"This film will always have a an important place in film history but I think what has given it that place is 1. The topic of the film and 2. The sheer acting ability of Jack Nicholson.

Nicholson here is a convicted criminal who fakes insanity to grab a reduced sentence sets about creating his own rules in a mental hospital.  Nicholson portrays something in us all, a free spirit confined and reduced to live by morals and codes he does not recognise if only to survive.  The film explores the disastrous effects of rebellion to those rules and how the desire for freedom if defeated in one can be ignited in another.

The film explores how others can be so easily lead and also how easily they can be defeated (Such as when Nicholson arranges for a prostitute for one of the younger inmates and the party he sets up), how fear can instill obedience (Nicholson's punishments)  The film is remarkable in its limited use of sets and instead relies on Nicholson's remarkable acting ability.

Nicholson is simply superb in this film.  His facial expression, his body movement say almost a thousand words more than his actual lines convey.  He is larger than life, eccentric and devious all the same.  At times you can relate to the character at others be pulling your hair out at his rash behavior.  That Nicholson can stir such emotion in a viewer is a testament to his acting ability.

Probably the most powerful scene in the entire film is where Nicholson says to the others while pointing to a huge ceramic wash basin that is sealed into the ground ""I am going to rip that out, put it through the window and break out of here""  The other 'inmates' mock him and laugh amongst themselves (Probably thinking to themselves 'He is madder than we are') Nicholson begins to attempt to pull the basin out, he strains and strains and slowly the others begin to think ""Maybe he is going to do it"" When finally he gives up.  He walks past the others, some mocking others not knowing where to look.  He walks halfway down the corridor then turns to them and says ""At least I tried!""",1194739200,4,2071,4.517426273458445
90721,5,0790732181,"I can't tell you how many times I have heard the same tired, old excuse for not thoroughly enjoying this classic, truly wonderful film.  You know the one, it goes a little something like this...""well I read the book and there is no way this film compares to Kesey's classic work"".  Well, to you folks, all I have to write in response is - I AGREE WITH YOU 100%!  And now that I got that out of my system, on with the review.

Randall Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicolson) is a randy, brawling, neer-do-well who finds himself heading back to prison for statutory rape.  In order to avoid going to jail, McMurphy feigns being insane so that he instead ends up being sentenced to a mental institution.  Of course he expects to ride out his jail sentence in relative comfort and ease there.  However, McMurphy soon discovers all is not bliss.  The institution's ward he's been assigned to is run by the emasculating, all-powerful, autocratic Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).  The rebellious McMurphy immediately clashes with the head nurse as the two of them become ensnared in a struggle for power over the hearts and minds of the other patients.

An excellent supporting cast indeed, brilliantly portray 'the cuckoo birds' our two main protagonists are vying over - William Redfield (Harding),  Danny DeVito (Martini),  Vincent Schiavelli (Frederickson), Christopher Lloyd (Taber), Sydney Lassick (Cheswick),  Brad Dourif (Best Supporting  Actor nominee as Billy Bibbit) and finally the great Native American actor Will Sampson (Chief Bromden).  For several of these actors, this was their most memorable performance.  And it is no wonder why, when you are working with as fine of a director as Milos Forman (""Amadeus"", ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"", ""Ragtime"" etc...) and the writing duo of Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman (Oscar Winners) who did such an admirable job dramatizing the more personal side of Kesey's masterpiece.  The film is seen from the eyes of Randall Patrick rather than Chief Bromden as it was in the novel.  This is perhaps the most glaring difference between the film and the book.  But, I always try to view the film as it's own work of art, completely separate from the novel it was based (I know, I know, it's much easier said than done, but hey, at least I try).

This was Jack's first Oscar, and man oh man did he deserve it.  Out of all the great many roles he's played, his performance as Randall Patrick McMurphy is definitely one of his finest ever.  I know it's clich to say that Louise Fletcher was born to play Nurse Ratched.  I can't imagine any other actress in that role.  It is too bad that her career might have been hurt a bit after she played such an evil character.  She never was able to get the big parts after this incredible Oscar winning performance.  And that is a shame, because there is no doubt this woman can act (although I doubt anything could top this performance).  The scenes between Nicolson and Fletcher are simply fascinating!  I highly recommend paying close attention to their facial expressions, their stare downs, the slight inflection of their voices, etc... the next time you are watching this one, particularly during the group therapy sessions where all of the madness indeed manifests itself.  It's easy to see why they both took home the treasured Oscar for their efforts (on a side note, this film became the first film in 41 years to sweep the major categories of best picture, director, actor, actress and screenplay.  The last film being Frank Capra's classic ""It Happened One Night"").

Not too many great movies are made from classic novels.  Here are some more of my favorite examples that quickly come to mind, feel free to add yours in the comment section - ""Grapes of Wrath"", ""To Kill A Mockingbird"",  ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"", ""The Good Earth"" and ""A Tale of Two Cities"" (the 1935 version with Ronald Colman)...",1189900800,8,3888,4.798496240601504
90722,4,0790732181,"Jack Nicholson is at his magnetic and unforgettable best as McMurphy the street smart, charismatic petty criminal who decides it might be easier to spend his latest jail sentence in the ""bin"" rather than on the prison work farm.  Louise Fletcher is also perfectly cast as Nurse Ratched a ""healer"" who does far more harm than good and quickly becomes ""Mac's"" nemesis and ultimate doom.  One can't help but wonder what happened in this fictional nurse's history and personal life to create such a creature.  Yet it is the character actors, including young Christopher Lloyd and Danny De Vito, who play the mentally disturbed and retarded inmates, that really make this film involving and convince the viewer they are seeing a realistic depiction of a 1960's mental ward.

For all the strengths of the film Ken Kesey's novel which is told from the viewpoint of Chief (clearly schizophrenic in the book) is much superior.  A Broadway revival, I saw, of the play (in about 2001?) with Gary Sinise was much closer to the message of the book as well as very memorable and moving.  Still, this is an excellent film with humor, tragedy, and above all poignancy which should not be missed by any fan of Jack Nicholson or 1970's cinema.

90726,5,0790732181,"""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975) is on every list of favorite films. It was the first film since ""It Happened One Night"" (1934) to win all five of the top Academy Awards, for best picture, actor (Nicholson), actress (Louise Fletcher), director (Milos Forman) and screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman).Roger Ebert

The film, 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' is based on Ken Kesey's 1962 best-selling novel, ""contained the prophetic essence of the whole Vietnam period of revolutionary politics going psychedelic"", as stated by Pauline Kael.

The movie's portrays a simple approach. Mcmurphy reminds me of my best friend, a free spirit in a closed system. The free spirit in this case is Jack Nicholson. Nicholson's performance is one of the high points in his career. Jack is a beloved star, an actor who is male. He gets away with things because he knows how to.

Nurse Ratched, Louise Fletcher, plays an inflexible woman and nurse. She must be in control of everything and everybody.

""The film is known as an anti-establishment parable, but achieves its success by deliberately choosing to use the mental patients as comic caricatures. This decision leads to the fishing trip, which is at once the most popular, and the most false, scene in the movie. It is McMurphy's great joyous thumb in the eye to Ratched and her kind, but the energy of the sequence cannot disguise the unease and confusion of men who, in many cases, have no idea where they are, or why."" Pauline Kael

Through-out the film I had two recurring thoughts. What is really going on in McMurphy's mind, and how much different and how much alike this mental institution is than the one where I received my mental health nursing education. In my estimation the film revolves around what McMurphy is thinking and then, how he acts out on those thoughts. The amazing reality is that the treatment works for McMurphy, who'd a thunk it? One of the last scenes where McMurphy is lying on the floor, thinking. Has he given up? I felt a great deal of ambivalence about him, because I did not know whether to laugh or cry. The antagonism between Nurse Ratched and McMurphy is pa;pable. She is straight-laced, and he is a free spirit.

Highly, Highly Recommended. prisrob",1186531200,,2244,4.815584415584415

90728,5,0790732181,"Many murder shows have as a plotline that the murderer decides to plead insanity, rather than face the real consequences of his actions. It is thought that the easy life of an insane asylum is far better than the bars of a prison. Certainly RP McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) thinks so. All he's done is have sex with a 15 year old - she claimed she was 18 - and he doesn't feel like doing work duty to wile away his time. He plays insane and figures he'll sit around and talk with the loonies for a while instead.

Unfortunately for RP, the woman in charge of this ward is Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). She runs a tight ship, and likes everything just so. Into her tidy little world comes the freewheeling RP, out to get the inmates to do wild things like watch the World Series instead of sit around and talk therapy.

Even though Nurse Ratched denies RP's quest to watch baseball, still, she almost seems to be helping the inmates - talking reasonably with them, giving them logical reasons why things are the way they are. Still, as time goes on, you start to sense that her priorities aren't necessarily with the patients. What she says seems reasonable - but the manner in which she pursues things, even when it's clearly bothering the patients, makes you think otherwise.

By the end of the movie, it is quite clear that Nurse Ratched is deliberately taking actions to cause great harm to her patients, to keep them docile and dependant. RP is only inches away from escape ...

What is amazing about this movie is not the specific plot - which rambles in and out of the various insane inmates' minds - but is the ensemble of actors gathered. Many of these actors went on to win awards, and each one is pretty much perfect in his or her role. Yes, the two main characters richly deserve the Oscars they won. But the casting director did a stupendous job here, casting the cream of the crop in terms of who could play each of these individuals. It is that group effort that really allows the realism to shine through, and to make this movie just as powerful and relatable now as it was when it first came out.

Highly recommended.

90740,5,0790732181,"A landmark film of the '70s, Forman's ""Nest"" is the anti-establishment film par excellence--and perhaps the finest showcase ever for the blazing talent and wild-man antics of a certain Jack Nicholson. Organizing illegal card games, playing hoops with the nutters, sneaking whores into the lockdown ward, McMurphy represents the zeal and passion of a truly free spirit. His interactions with Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif, and a young Danny DeVito are both hilarious and tragic, but it's his conflict with fellow Oscar winner Fletcher, as the hateful, repressed, order-obsessed Nurse Ratched, that ultimately seals his fate. Based on Ken Kesey's mordant novel, ""Nest"" is a grimly funny movie about madness and our irrepressible need to challenge authority.",1183507200,2,756,5.525862068965517
90741,3,0790732181,"Some aspects of the movie were excellent.  Nicholson did a hell of a job, like always.  He is just as believable as he wants to be.  He is just crazy enough for the viewer to wonder if he belongs in the mental facility or if he is just faking to stay out of a labor-yard or the state penitentary.  Some of his interactions with the head nurse and the other patients are unforgettable, like when he pretends he is watching baseball and starts the play by play announcing when the head nurse refuses to let the patients watch the world series.

I liked most of the movie and the plot development seemed to be right on cue.  But once the movie started winding down, things stopped being believable.  McMurphy seems to leave and enter the facility whenever he wants, cleverly eluding security, he bribes the guard with a box of liquor, and convinces his girlfriend to sleep with one of the patients.  After the entire routine of trashing the mental facility at the cover of night, he decided to STAY instead of escape, when he could have easily escaped.  This was just absurd and the movie lost its purpose at that point.

In typical, depressing fashion, everything falls apart, when the innocent young man commits suicide, McMurphy forsakes another attempt to escape.  I won't give away the ending, but its not satisfying and not what I was hoping for, it made me feel that I wasted 2 1/2 hours of watching the film.

There were few enduring lessons; other than the motif of individuals who are on power trips, personified by the head nurse.  The book is a classic and is known for developing this relationship masterfully.  But in a 2 1/2 hour movie, it is hard to accomplish this dense character development.  It just didn't work in my eyes.

This film usually gets great ratings, but it just didn't fly for me.  I like classics, like Cool Hand Luke and the Godfather.  But I don't like depressing, meaningless endings.  Death, depression and failure don't necessarily make a ""good"" movie in my eyes.  There needs to be more purpose behind it.  The conversations and acting were great, but the last half hour of the movie was disappointing.

It seems as the writer of the script, and the author for that matter, had excellent material but really didn't know how to wrap it up for a memorable ending.",1182643200,3,2298,4.594594594594595

The amazing thing about this movie is that one does not need to be institutionalized to see that life itself is filled with ""slightly off"" people.  No matter who or where you're from, we are all aware of how the term ""crazy"" has officially ingrained itself as a ""normal"" term in our daily vocabulary.

Frankly, I don't believe any of these characters were seriously insane.
I am confident quite a few people would agree with me in that statement.

What I found the most heartbreaking was the fact that the craziest of them all was the control-freak Ratched nurse who was supposedly there to help these people.  It truly sickens me when such villains feed off of the fragility of the vulnerable.  Talk about snatching candy away from a poor, helpless baby...

To be honest, I've only seen this movie about three or four times.
But it has been one of those movies that really left an imprint in my mind by inspiring me to accept the fact that nobody is perfect -
and that sometimes, striving for perfection can indeed drive the most normal person insane.

The premise is a good one-- a couple of wackos played by Danny DeVito, Jack Nicholson, Christopher Lloyd, and an Indian perform hijinks in an asylum and they plot to break out.  The laughs, however, are few and far between and at times the only things that are funny are Jack Nicholson's hat and the fact that Michael Douglas directed this.

My biggest problem is that Jack Nicholson, who is great as The Joker (Batman), the Devil (The Witches of Eastwick) and a Wolf (Wolf) isn't very gifted at comedy.  Imagine how much crazier it would have been if the crazy people were led by somebody like Tim Allen or Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan!

Nicholson, being a bit of a loser and a con-artist, becomes a gift on the mental ward. One could say, he is the best therapist most of the patients have ever had--organizing basketball games, fishing expeditions,getting card games going, and even bringing women into the hospital!

Enter in----Nurse Ratchett (Louise Fletcher).  Oh My! And she plays her to perfection---soft spoken as an angel, a sweet, sugary grin, and  completely devoted to the nursing proffesion.....but inside that shell, Nurse Ratchett has no soul or empathy or feeling. She knows every patients' weakness and she uses that power to keep each one physically and emotionally bound around her clawed, devilish fingers.

One of the most fascinating aspects to this film is watching how Nicholson's character shapes and changes the characters of the other inmates.

Aside from that false judgement, I was biased against the movie because of the era in which it was made. As a classic film fan, it is sometimes difficult not to resent some of the films that helped Hollywood progress away from the traditions of the classic era. However, any way you look at this movie, it is hard not to recognize the quality of the story and of the actors' performances.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a film about a man Randle (Jack Nicholson) who is sent to a mental institution to be evaluated because of his behavior in jail. The doctors think he could be faking insanity in order to avoid the rest of his jail time, but he keeps them guessing with strange behavior. Randle becomes friends with the men in the ward, a diverse group including a young man with a stutter named Brad Dourif (Billy Bibbit), a deaf and dumb Indian called Chief (Will Sampson), a rigid man named Harding (William Redfield), and a hyperactive Italian called Martini (Danny deVito). Randle helps these men to fight back against the abusive power of the nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) causing trouble for everyone but giving them a sense of idenity and happiness.

This is a long film, but it is very emotional and powerful. Nicholson makes his character likable but appropriately flawed. Dourif presents his character innocently and sweetly like a little brother one needs to protect. Sampson is excellent as the Chief, one of the most interesting characters in the film.

90779,5,0790732181,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) is one of the greatest American films of all time - a $4.4 million dollar effort directed by Czech Milos Forman. Its allegorical theme is set in the world of an authentic mental hospital (Oregon State Hospital in Salem, Oregon), a place of rebellion exhibited by a energetic, flamboyant, wise-guy anti-hero against the Establishment, institutional authority and status-quo attitudes (personified by the patients' supervisory nurse). [Forman himself noted that the asylum was a metaphor for the Soviet Union (embodied as Nurse Ratched) and the desire to escape.]

Expressing his basic human rights and impulses, the protagonist protests against heavy-handed rules about watching the World Series, and illegally stages both a fishing trip and a drinking party in the ward - leading to his own paralyzing lobotomy.

Jack Nicholson's acting persona as the heroic rebel McMurphy, who lives free or dies (through an act of mercy killing), had earlier been set with his performances in Easy Rider (1969) and Five Easy Pieces (1970). The mid-70s baby-boomers' counter-culture was ripe for a film dramatizing rebellion and insubordination against oppressive bureaucracy and an insistence upon rights, self-expression, and freedom. Here Nicholson takes his incredible skills as an actor to new levels.  I can't picture any other actor pulling this performance off.

See this film for humanity it sheds and the dramatic ending which will haunt you.  The film has many dramatic arcs and a very believable antagonist in Nurse Ratched.  There's dramatic tension produced in every scene and after the first 30 minutes the film puts you into a hypnotic trance.  You feel you're there in all the pain and human suffering.

This is a must see.  You won't turn your eyes away from it and you will probably want to see it again and again...it's that powerful of a motion picture.",1153958400,3,1898,5.176470588235294

The theme - the revolutionary fighting against injustice - is splendidly 60sish, naive in a way, but also extraordinarily vivid.  Of course, it is the characters who really make this, in Chief (the extraordinarily sensitive narrator of the novel) and of course, the hero Murphy.  But there are scores of others, so funny and tragic and human.

Given my stellar experience with the book, I was really disappointed by this film.  It simply did not get the depth of the characters, in particular the chief, who the film makes just weird and whose behavior is incomprehensible when he escapes.  Moreover, Nicolson's Murphy was more a simple macho type hero, and had little of the self-serving ambiguity, the self-defeating anger, and yet with the surprising empathy from the novel - it just isn't anywhere near as nuanced a performance as he gave in say, 5 easy pieces or the last detail.

I know I will be in the minority here, but seriously, I recommend reading the novel.  Its complexity, its characters, and the beauty of its prose make the shortcut of a film virtually impossible in my opinion.  This film just doesn't make it.  It is too hollywood and neatly packaged, too rowdy when it should have been tragic, and lacking the sparkling inner life and insights of the chief. This film is mostly about caricatures.

The editorial review remarks that the film seems so real at times that it feels almost like a documentary, and this is true.

90785,5,0790732181,"This is one of the most iconic movies of all time, sweeping the oscars and rightfully so, 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is a brilliant film.  Jack Nicholson in his oscar winning performance as R.P. McMurphy chanels everything that makes Jack the actor he is for a once in a lifetime performance.  McMurphy has five accounts of assault and is facing jail time, so he decides that a term in a mental ward has got to be better than the pen, so he fakes insanity (sort-of) so he can serve his sentence in different suroundings.  Once in the door though, it's not so easy to leave again.  He has to face down Nurse Ratched (Louse Fletcher in a very tame, subdued yet powerful performance that also won her the oscar) and Nurse Ratched is not easily persuaded...just watch the debate over watching the world series.  There are many scenes in this film that are staples in movie history, many scenes that stand out as what movies are supposed to be, and the acting on all fronts is spot-on.  A young Danny DeVito plays the innocent and playful Martini, and Christopher Lloyd in his first roll plays the very memerable Taber.  But it's, of course, Jack Nicholson that steals every scene, although I have to say that Sydney Lassick as Cheswick was some very hard competition...he was perfect in his role...just watch his tantrum over cigarettes.  Anyways, this is one of those films you should be required to see, but your not so many may not have seen it...I just hope that after reading this review you'll go out and rent it ASAP.

There is so much cool sh*t going on with this film. If you are not familiar with my movie reviews, I love great quotes in film... This movie is chock full of 'em. Great acting galore from JACK NICHOLSON (he plays Randal P Mcmurphy, the best character a movie ever saw.) This film won him a best acting Oscar in 1976. The whole panel of ""mental defectives"" make great characters too, you may recognize CHRISTOPHER LLOYD and DANNY DEVITO in some of their earliest roles. Then there is that evil twisted bitch Nurse Ratched, played by my baby's momma (no actually she is played by LOUISE FLETCHER, who also won an Oscar for her role.)

The premise of this thing is that MacMurphy is imprisoned on a work farm after being charged with statitory ""she was 15 going on 35, and she told me she was 18."" In order to get out of it, he pretends to be crazy. They believe him (he is at least a little nuts) and they send him to a psych ward. Here we meet the rest of the boys, who are all being twiddled around by this Nurse Ratched, who satisfies her power needs by basically keeping these guys crazy. Randy P catches on quick ""that nurse, she's something of a cun* ain't she?"" and decides to spread his free will around causing some immediate sparks between the two. Also we are introduced to the Chief, you'll have to see the movie to learn more about him.

This movie touched me on every degree, and it ain't no sap either... it's hillarious all along the way. The end will make your head spin though, but lord is it good.

I highly recommend this film. Jack Nicholsons hands down best role. I say one to have in your collection, because it deserves seeing a lot of times.

Also the book. I had seen the movie a million times before I actually read the book and was suprised at how much BETTER the book was. Written by Ken Kesey, a character in his own right.. check that out too.

90797,5,0790732181,"I cried the first time I saw this film, especially at the ending.  I have seen many movies since then, of varying degrees of quality; but nevertheless, this one remains among the most poignant, and ranks, for me, in a category with a few select, carefully chosen films. Few movies have affected me so deeply and on so many levels as Milos Forman's ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest''.
  The plot is deceptively simple, yet conceals a number of thought-provoking and disturbing concepts beneath the surface.
  A convict named Randall McMurphy (played with great gusto and characteristic swagger by Jack Nicholson) is transferred to a state mental hospital after feigning insanity in order to escape the drudgery of the work farm. The doctors at the hospital, particularly the head doctor, are aware that McMurphy is relatively sane (though ""dangerous"", as one put's it), yet nevertheless insist on detaining and ""examining"" him until his sanity is confirmed.
 McMurphy is bawdy and rebellious, and from the onset of his arrival attempts to liberate the hospital's inmates from the oppression of the tyrannical Nurse Ratched (played with blood-curdling iciness by Louise Fletcher; both Fletcher and Nicholson won Oscars for this movie, and deservedly so. Their performances capture perfectly the essence of their characters). McMurphy defies the authority of Nurse Ratched at every turn, gradually leading the patients, particularly a hulking ""deaf-mute"" Indian named Bromden, to greater personal freedom. The consequences of his actions, however, are ultimately tragic. I'll leave you to find out what happens in the end for yourself, though rest assured, it is profoundly shocking and terribly tragic, and if you have even a shred of human compassion you'll probably shed a tear or two (I cried heartily, which I rarely do, but that's just me).
 ""One flew over the Cuckoo's nest"", adapted from a popular 1960s Ken Kesey novel of the same name, is one of my favorite films.  The tone is perfect (though many of the book's hallucinogenics have been, understandably, left out) the directing of Milos Forman (director of ""Amadeus"", another of my favorite films) is beyond criticism, the performances are all spot on, the characters are three-dimensional human beings instead of over simplified caricatures, and the plot is compelling. The only thing approaching criticism which I have in regards to this movie is that the book is a somewhat more cerebral experience.
  I'm not quite sure what it is, aside from some of the more obvious aspects, but something about ""Cuckoo's nest"" really connects to some deeply rooted part of my psyche. Perhaps it is related in someway to the desire lurking inside all of us for rebellion against ""the system""; the successive ""victories"" McMurphy scores against Nurse Ratched are thrilling, and make you literally tremble with excitement at the prospect of her downfall, even when the outcome is known.
 Still, ""Cuckoo's nest"" isn't for everyone. Some may find the element's of the story too downbeat and depressing to fully enjoy; but nevertheless I give it full credit for turning me into the raging hellion I am today. Down with the establishment!",1137974400,4,3181,5.157281553398058

This is the story of a mental hospital and those coming and going, but it is told through the point of view of the patients who are interested in their new roommate R. P. MacMurphy.  The story itself prompted the reform of the mental hospital system itself due to its shocking and abusive content.  The head nurse, in this story, controlls essentially everyone involved with her ward, including the doctors.  In order to boost her own ego, she breaks down her patients in group therapy sessions.  This is especially true with a studdering, young patient called Billy, and she attempts this often with the most likely rather sane Mr. MacMurphy.  Eventually, Mr. MacMurphy's abrasive behavior gets him in much trouble and prompts the head nurse to take action against him.  All MacMurphy grew to want was his freedom, and to see his new friends free of their own minds.  Unfortunately, his quest to do so is hindered by his own warped ethics and the head nurse's ego trips.

90810,5,0790732181,"This review is for the 2002 Two-Disc Special Edition by Warner Brothers

The movie involves a rebellious prison inmate named Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) who is sent to a mental hospital to be evaluated for possible mental disorders.  McMurphy is placed in a ward with seventeen other patients and begins to cause quite a stir with his outrageous behavior.  Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) holds daily therapy sessions with the group to help facilitate healing with their illnesses and after a while, the relationship between McMurphy and the nurse becomes a powder-keg waiting to explode.  This sets up the rest of the film where McMurphy realizes that his evaluation may be extended indefinitely and has to deal with his situation in extraordinary terms.

The movie is brilliant in the way it deals with a sensitive issue in a dignified and positive way.  It's not designed to make you laugh at the patients, but rather have you laugh and feel pain with them.  Of course the greatest stroke of genius is the way Jack Nicholson leads the awaking of these confined individuals and brings some to a higher state of mental health.  It's not that he's doing it by design; it's simply because of his outgoing, funloving and confrontational personality that infuses energy, confidence and self-awareness in the other patients.  On the reserve side, the movie paints a scathing indictment against the medical system in the way it treats their patients.  The movie won five Oscars including best picture, actor and actress.  This DVD is a must-have for the serious film buff.

The DVD quality is top-notch.  The widescreen picture is sharp and clean and the sound is decent too.  There are quite a lot of bonuses in this two-disc package including behind the scenes features of how the film was made and feature-length audio commentary by director Milos Foreman.

90815,5,0790732181,"This is a classic film that won the award for best picture in 1975. That shouldn't be a surprise given the all-star cast and an unbelievable script. If you have not seen this movie before, I strongly recommend it. I first saw this film when I was in high school. I was reading the book and needed to give a report on it, so I decided watching the movie would make it easier. I love the movie. But for those new to this movie, you also need to prepare to be very disturbed. ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is several things: very intriguing, haunting, humorous, disturbing and touching. My mom refuses to watch this movie because it bothers her too much, but this is a movie I can watch again and again.

The acting in this movie is absolutely superb! The amazing lineup of actors show us their incredible ability to become their characters and make us believe they are actually ""crazy."" We start with an old veteran; Jack Nicholson, the novice of disturbing roles. With those conniving eyes and huge mad grin, who could play the role of R.P. McMurphy better?

McMurphy is an inmate charged with statutory rape, who basically gets tired of life behind bars and will do anything for a little vacation, even if that means a trip to the funny farm. McMurphy is a master manipulator, and due to his actions in prison, McMurphy was taken to the mental institution to ""determine if he's mentally ill."" Although the authorities suspect that he is faking everything, McMurphy denies it.

McMurphy is instantly entered into a world of pill-popping, poker-playing, unstable therapy-needers, who are surrounded by elevator music, courtesy of Nurse Ratched. It is then that we get to see all these patients and their incredible personalities.

The Chief: A huge soft-spoken Native American who has everybody thinking he is really ""deaf and dumb."" McMurphy actually befriends the Chief, teaching him to play basketball and recruiting him for escape help. They become friends and decide to plan an escape together later on.

Billy Bibbett: Billy is my favorite character and Brad Dourif plays him exceptionally well in his film debut. Wild-eyed lady-lover Billy is a young man who has a relentless stuttering problem and a tendency to want to commit suicide. His sweet innocence coupled with his mental situations make him a very interesting individual.

Martini: Danny DeVito was just as short then as he is now. DeVito plays the squinty-eyed Martini who has an uncanny knack for being repetitive with words and actions.

Harding: Played by William Redfield, Harding is the ""intelligent"" one of the bunch who is coping with his suspicions about his wife being attractive to other men in his eyes. Some of the patients, especially Taber, enjoy pushing his buttons.

Taber: We all know Christopher Lloyd from the ""Back To The Future"" and ""The Addams Family"" series. Lloyd was perfectly cast for the role as Taber, with his wide, bugged-out eyes and very loud voice. Taber picks on those who he thinks are full of bull s**** but otherwise, he just goes with the flow.

Cheswick: Another one of my favorite characters. Sensitive follower Charlie Cheswick played fantastically by Sydney Lassick, becomes the first patient other than McMurphy to stand up to Nurse Ratched with how he feels, only to end up in line for shock treatment.

Finally, there is the dreaded Nurse Ratched. Played by Louise Fletcher in a very convincing performance. Seemingly sweet and soft-spoken Nurse Ratched basically has all the patients wrapped around her finger and under her thumb. In a calmly and coolly manipulative style, Ratched is adamant about keeping the patients at bay with her ""carefully planned schedule.""

There are many more wonderful characters as well including Banchini (aka ""I'm tired""), Mr. Fredrickson (You all remember Vincent as Mr. Fargas in ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" and as the Subway Ghost in ""Ghost"") and his ""sidekick"" Jimmy. Then there's the ""Colonel"" with the wide intense eyes, who enjoys mumbling to himself. You'll also see the late great Scatman Crothers as Mr. Turkle, the night monitor whom McMurphy pays with cash and women in exchange for his silence so everyone can have a party.

Once McMurphy enters the ward, he gets a first hand look at the lives of the patients and realizes that taking a vacation in a mental ward with the likes of Nurse Ratched around is no picnic in the park. Nurse Ratched does indeed have a carefully planned schedule; a schedule to basically dictate what the patients can and cannot do, and only help them according to her standards. Her idea of helping the patients is to play loud boring music, conduct the therapy sessions as if she is a grade school teacher looking down at her students, and refuse to listen to ideas that could REALLY make the patients feel better. It's almost as if she, in her quiet manipulative way, wants to keep the patients ""shrunk down to size"" and feeling like they are small people who need to look up to someone smarter that knows what's best for them. In reality, if you treat people like they are ""small"" than they will feel that way and feel like they have no choice but to do whatever she says. This is the game that Ratched plays with the patients. Nobody bothers to take a stand about what they feel should be done; at least not until R.P. McMurphy comes around and shows them that they are no different than others and that they have a right to have an opinion. That's what makes this film so unique. Here we have a criminal in McMurphy, who knows better than Nurse Ratched about how to work with the patients. Nurse Ratched fails to heed to the fact that there are different kinds of therapy for everybody.

So who is REALLY the crazy one here? Is it the group of ""mental defectives,"" or is it the nurse who makes their mental states worse? Let's examine this for a moment: one of the most memorable scenes is when McMurphy confronts Ratched about changing the daily schedule so they can watch the World Series. Knowing that most of the patients are under her thumb (with the rest being too severely out there to know the difference), she agrees to hold a vote. Nine people must vote. It is then that McMurphy realizes just how much power Ratched has over the patients. Only a couple raises their hands to vote despite McMurphy's encouragement. In fact, some of the patients look downright scared to vote. What does that tell you?

But it is R.P. McMurphy's way of treating the patients; his jokes, his encouraging words, and overall respect of them being humans like everyone else (only with a few problems), that inspires some of the patients to take a stand and speak up about what they feel. But Ratched's smooth manipulative mode is quick to turn back on again. Let's examine another memorable scenario: Take the ultra sensitive Mr. Cheswick. Normally one who would never have made any comments, Cheswick inquires about what McMurphy had mentioned about the World Series. He tells Nurse Ratched ""I've never been to a baseball game and I think I'd like to see one. That could be good therapy too wouldn't it Ms. Ratched?"" Now why in the world would Nurse Ratched want to give up her powerful routine because of someone else's opinion and wishes, even if it could help that person? No, her power is more important than helping others. After another vote is held, there are nine patients who vote this time thanks to McMurphy's influence on them. Nine votes. That was the maximum they needed right? Wrong! Now Nurse Ratched decides that the severely mentally impaired people need to count as well (and she knows darn well that they do not have the capacity to vote let alone tie their own shoes). But McMurphy is determined and desperately goes around to the other patients trying to get just one of them to vote. Who gets in a vote? Why it's' none other than the so-called ""deaf and dumb"" Chief! But even that is not enough. ""The vote was closed,"" Ratched tells McMurphy and promptly turns the elevator music on.

So you can clearly see how this institution operates. Everything is controlled by Ratched's iron fist and she manipulates these mentally unstable people to act out in unstable ways and that in turn leads them to the shock treatment room; a place none of them likes to go. It is almost like punishment for wanting something done fair, because really, when these patients act out in their crazy ways, it is over subjects that are completely normal. Like when Cheswick inquires about his cigarettes and why he cannot have them: ""I ain't no little kid!"" he yells, ""What gives you the right to dish out the cigarettes any time you feel like it huh? ""I want something done!"" Is that not a normal thing to want? Is it not normal for a grown man like Cheswick to want to be treated like an adult and not a child? Isn't it normal for people like Cheswick to want their cigarettes? Let him have his cigarettes. Maybe it's a comfort for someone who is unstable. But no, instead, Ratched continues her degrading treatment by yelling at Cheswick to ""sit down,"" and when he doesn't, he is taken for his shock treatment. So Ratched deprives these people of respect by treating them like children, deprives them of their willingness to speak out (until McMurphy came around), and also deprives them of getting involved in things that they may like to do to make them feel more at ease and more sane. Ratched just basically keeps these people insane with her crude manipulative personality. This in turn creates friction and this in turn makes them seem like they're acting crazy when really all they want is some real respect and some therapy that works for them.

Nurse Ratched's way of treating the patients makes McMurphy crazy. You can see that even a criminal would know how to better care for the mental health of the patients than Ratched does. McMurphy gives the patients royal treatment from hijacking a bus and taking them on a fishing trip, to betting with them in poker, to playing basketball with them, to giving them a fantastic night time party with booze, women, dancing and music. The party was supposed to be a last hurrah before McMurphy took off on his escape, but when morning came and Ratched found the rooms in squander, all hell broke loose. Young stutterer, Billy Bibbitt,  who for a moment DOES NOT stutter anymore (due to his new sense of self that McMurphy helped him get most likely) commits a terrible act upon himself after trying to explain to Nurse Ratched the situation he was in with a woman (and by the way, Ratched treated Billy terribly in this part; as if he was a bad little boy who had done something wrong). The ending is one of the most disturbing parts of the film. Let's just say that McMurphy is more than a little relaxed after shock treatment and that he escapes with the Chief in a way you may not have imagined. Even with a sore neck, in the end, I'm sure Ratched was pleased. After all, it was McMurphy who came in and tried to give the patients freedom, fun and overall good therapy; something she would not do. With McMurphy out of the picture, she could continue her charade.

There is something to be said for heroes that come in the most un-likely forms. In this case it came in the form of a criminal. A criminal who believed what Ratched was doing to himself and the patients was criminal and fought to the end to help the patients find themselves. There is also something to be said for how far one will go to keep power and authority, and this could include a nurse keeping mentally ill patients mentally ill by depriving them and treating them as low, small people. Ratched was willing to go to any length, but so was McMurphy. What an odd pair they make.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why this film won the Oscar in 1975 for Best Picture. This DVD also includes a description of the making of ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" as well as cast biographies. It may not be one of those clich ""happily-ever-after"" films but it's one of the most unique movies around and you're sure to love the mixture of humor and insanity that makes this film special.

90817,5,0790732181,"First off, the acting in this movie is amazing. Jack Nicholson gives the best performance of his life and is simply unbelievable. His performance is in my opinion one of the best ever. Sydney Lassick delivers also an extraordinary performance as Charlie Cheswick. On the other hand, I didn't find Louise Fletcher to do that good of a job. I found her performance to be way overrated and found it to be fairly descent but definitely not worthy of best actress.

Now to the movie. Beware if you are sensitive, the movie is very sad and depressing. You'll probably cry at the awful treatment that you see. I found myself cussing at the TV and screaming at nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). I mean, I hated her. I was screaming at her nonstop. She was so awful to everyone. This mental institution is so awful that it is probably making everyone there a lot more crazy than they were. Jack Nicholson is McMurphy, a guy who fakes insanity to get out of prison. He is therefore sent to a mental institution. There, he is the leader. He befriends everyone and is their leader. They love him and he loves them. But, Nurse Ratched and her goons stand in his way to freedom and won't even let them watch the world series. The movie is very sad and touching and the ending is at first terribly depressing and then there is a joyous occasion. The electroshocking of the patients is awful and made me feel like wanting to strike back against this. You'll hate the goons and that stupid nurse Ratched. The movie is haunting and I was so into it that I would be cheering for the patients, laughing with them, crying with them, and hurling insults at nurse Ratched. I was so into it that I'd be like: ""You stupid bit**!!! Just let them watch the World Seires! Come on!"" I got very emotionally into it and connected with all of the patients. This movie is a haunting journey and the treatment in this institution is criminal and is making all of the patients insane or more insane than they were. This is an excellent movie that is worthy of any serious collection and is in my opinion Jack Nicholson's best movie and his finest performance.",1122422400,,2123,4.5

90829,5,0790732181,"In terms of movies that had deep, meaningful storylines, expert writing, great actors and great directors, no era can beat the 1970s'. One hardly can hardly argue with this assertion, since films like ""The Godfather"", ""The Last Picture Show"", ""Nashville"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Godfather Part II"" and this 1975 masterpiece based on Ken Kesey's novel all came from this era.

In ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", Jack Nicholson plays Randall P. McMurphy, a slightly maniacal man who is placed in a state mental hospital for an evaluation. There he encounters a stunning group of social misfits, wackos and mentally challenged people (played adeptly by future stars Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif and Danny DeVito as well as renowned character actor Vincent Schiavelli). He also encounters Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a heartless woman whom McMurphy vows to drive crazy within one week. At first McMurphy is taken aback by his new surroundings. But as the film progresses, McMurphy developes a profound understanding for his fellow inmates, which ultimately helps him become a better man.

This film is truly excellent. Although Nicholson had been making movies for quite some time and made some excellent films (""Easy Rider"", ""Five Easy Pieces"", ""Carnal Knowledge"", ""The Last Detail"", ""Chinatown""), this was the film that gave him his first of three Oscars and cemented him as the Brando-esque acting god he's considered as today. Louise Fletcher also won an Oscar for her fiery portrayal as Nurse Ratched. He plays the role with the kind of intensity possessed by classic movie villians like Norman Baits and even some of Nicholson's characters, but comes off as less of a pyschopath and more of a miserable wench, which is essentially what her character is. Fletcher captures the character to a tee and deserved the Oscar. Another actor who deserves mention is Danny DeVito. Even though he only has a small role as Martini, he imbues the character with genuine sincerity, and this is probably my second favorite performance by him (his portrayal of the Penguin in ""Batman Returns"" is my first).

To put this in simple terms, this film is an absolute must have and one of the best films ever made. A masterpiece in every sense of the word.",1120435200,,2243,5.040431266846361

90831,5,0790732181,"Jack Nicholson portrays a man who was arrested numerous times for burglery and attempted rape. He wants to beat the rap and pretends he's insane.  He thinks it's funny that he can get out of jail and stay in an Insane Hospital for 68 days.

Only, he checks in and it turns out that the nurses there think he's a criminally insane!

  The charactor, Randall, that Nicholson brilliantly portrays is a loudmouth cussin' rebel.  He interacts with the other men in the looney bin and he is able to reach them on an interpersonal level that Nurse Ratchet and all the other Psych Doctors cannot.  He encourages them to participate in games of basketball and he likes to tease them all by calling them insulting names.  One day, he jumps the fence while the guards are distracted.  He steals the bus that takes the pscych patients on their outings and they borrow a fishing boat.  This leads to a wild day of successful fishing, boating and having sex with woman named Candy.  By the time the USS Luney Boat pulls into the boat yard, the psych team is there to greet them.  BOY - it's trouble.

  Randall gets in trouble and next thing you know, they're arguing in group session with nurse Ratchet, who is an overbearing, awful nurse who is as theraputic as a guillatione.

She is just terrible with the clients - not respectful - not concerned about thier manhood or manly interests at all.

As a matter of fact, I doubt she has a man in her life at all.

  One night, Randall plans his escape.  He unlocks the metal bars in front of the windows and these two girls bring bags and bags of booze for them to drink as well as all the other clients.  All the clients are mal-adjusted but I wouldn't really classify them as being crazy.  They're all having trouble coping with life and they regress and loose their tempers real bad over little silly things, but they are not crazy.  The gang gets boozed up and one of the boys gets a woman for the first time in his life.  ALl this crazy action is actually the most theraputic activities that the creeps in the Insane Hospital have ever seen, and they all respond well to it.  Now comes the awful ending - they deal with Randall as if he were criminally insane.  They lobe him up and he's done for.....his friend, the Chief then leaves the looney bin.

It's such a well done movie and it is hilarious throughout!  Jack uses language that is colorful and a bit offensive, which leads to the overall enjoyment of this particular film

  This film is 30 years old and it is a classic film depicting mental illness and what it is and what it may not be.  It is fun to see the old '45's spinning on the turntable and there is alot of visual reference to the way the world was in 1975.  Jack Nicholson is a youthful 35 year old young man, and that in itself is worth the time seeting this old film.  Cuckoo's Nest is a classic and all person studying modern Psych owe it to themselves to be conversant about this important film.",1111968000,,2961,4.370642201834863
90832,5,0790732181,"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is unforgettable. Filled with great acting, a gripping storyline, and a terrific message, this is one movie that you will remember. It is nothing like the average, worthless flicks currently in theaters. It's about hope, overcoming difficult situations, and conformity.

Randall P. MacMurphy recently gets sent to spend time in a strict mental institution after commiting assualt, among other crimes. To see if there really is a problem with his mind, the nurses observe him for a period of days. But as soon as Mac arrives, things change at the quiet hospital. He befriends the other patients, and teaches them many valuable lessons -- like how to fish, or how to really set off Nurse Ratched -- probably the most evil of characters in movie history.

The emotional conclusion is not one of dissapointment, no matter how sad it gets. You'll see why this deserves such recognition as a great work of art.

Great peformances and overall talent really make One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest worth watching over and over. This has to be Jack Nicholson's best. Amazing writing and character development progress better deeper into the plot. You really care for the characters unlike anything else. I wish more films like this were made.

Ken Kesey never so the movie, but you should definitely see the movie. The movie is based on Kesey's book but very different than the book.

90839,5,0790732181,"One flew over the Cuckoo's nest, is a brilliant piece of film making, directed by Milos Forman and starring Jack Nicholson in a league of his own.

  The 1975 film centres around Randall P. McMurphy as a volunteer mental patient with a hyperactive attitude. After tangling with the strict nurse (played by Louise Fletcher) and being degraded by her in front of all the other loonies he decides to bend the rules and create an even bigger rift between them. He at one point even escapes and takes the motley crue of comatose and whacked out people on a fishing trip, claiming "" Cheer up Martini, we're not loonies, we're not loonies we're fishermen"" but this creates more tension and after raising the roof a bit more he ends up forming a strange friendship with the chief and as it ends he is punished severely, he is electrocuted and when that doesn't stop him they decide to lobotomize and therefore ends up being killed in his peril by the chief to save him from the agony that would be the rest of his life.

 The film raises the question "" are institutes really this grim and dependant on routine? Do people have to eat through straws, are the frontal lobotomies necessary? I think this film gives a message and a whole load of entertainment with it.

 The film is one of the most original things I have ever seen it was adapted from a Ken Casey novel but doesn't steal it outright, it adds atmosphere and joy. The scenes are long but memorable, the mood comedic, sad and tense it makes for an impressive spectacle beyond almost anything I have ever seen.",1100649600,,1560,4.51063829787234
90840,5,0790732181,"This film has a special place in my heart because it was the first film I saw starring Jack Nicholson.  When he first appears on screen here after being uncuffed by the guards, you can feel the whole screen just light up with Jack's burning charisma.  I was determined to seek out after this anything I could with Nicholson because Jack was the man(""Goin South"", anyone?).  When ""Cuckoo's Nest"" came out in 1975 Nicholson had already established himself as a star in films.  The only thing that he needed was that shiny gold statuette to validate him as a legend.  Anyone who read Ken Kesey's book on which this was based would agree that Nicholson was born to play R.P. McMurphy.  A rebel stuck in a psychiatric ward would afford Nicholson the opportunity to chew the scenery.  Watching this film again recently I was struck how subdued his performance is here.  Not to be overlooked is Louise Fletcher's performance as the controlling Nurse Ratched.  Her work here is very much the equal of Nicholson's.  The temptation to play this part broadly may have been there, but Fletcher plays her in an understated manner that not so much imbues sympathy for her character but pathos.  The strong supporting cast here includes Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and most effectively Brad Dourif as Billy, an introverted patient who Ratched probably exhibits the most control over.  One weakness of the film is the casting of Chief

Bromden, a large deaf and dumb Indian played by Will Sampson.  In Kesey's book, Bromden is the narrator of the story.  The only thing Sampson brings to the part is that he is a big Indian.  Praise also must be given to director Milos Forman, a recent emigre to this country from Czechoslavakia for translating this American story to big screen and to Bo Goldman for adapting Kesey's novel, even though at the time Kesey wasted little time in trashing the film.  On a final note, a few years ago I was fortunate to have seen the stage adaptation of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" in New York with Gary Sinise playing McMurphy.  Expecting a re-enactment of the film, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this production had their own unique interpretation of the material.  As far as Sinise's portrayal, let's just say you would not confuse his interpretation of McMurphy with Jack Nicholson's.",1096502400,6,2322,4.788944723618091

All these years, I could still remember vividly the Chief (the Indian that was as big as a tree trunk)and the anti-establishment McMurphy (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson).  It's like walking down the memory lane when I gotten myself the DVD rendition of the movie.  With advent of digital and Dolby technologies, now I am able to appreciate this movie in its full glory.  This is one of those movies that typified the triumph of the human spirits, about those rare individuals who are courageous enough to go against the grain.  What made this offering special is that this new version contains more than ten deleted scenes; behind-the-scenes where the older Danny De Vito, Christopher Lloyd, Bo Goldman, Saul Zaents, Milos Forman, Michael Douglas, Christine Fletcher talked reflectively and candidly about their involvements.  It's rather intriguing to know the effort that they went into just to source the Indian; Milos Forman comparing this movie with his ex-country Czech where people lived under the repressive regime and thus, him being the right Director for the movie; the hardship in trying to find a backer to finance this movie; Burt Reynolds was in contention to play McMurphy's character and so forth.  Over the years, this movie hasn't aged a bit and it still manages to captivate this very humane story.  Now with all these additions, it makes it a more worthwhile investment to revisit our memory yet again.  At times, old wine does get better with age.  If not been preserved correctly, as you know better, wine would be transformed into vinegar. In this instance, it doesn't happen.

This is about freedom fighting, endlessly, against the forces of tyranny, fear and manipulation.  Though McMurphy pays dearly for his resistance, he becomes a martyr and an example for the rest of the inmates - who learn the true nature of their terrible slavemaster, ""Nurse"" Ratchet.  Ms. Ratchet symbolizes everything that is wrong and truly evil in this life.  She, as a Nurse and a medical practicioner, has a responsibility to further and promote life.  Instead, she is the ultimate symbol of smothering, vast evil cloaked in the guise of a ""helper"" or ""surrogate mother.""  Ms. Ratchet is a creature who uses fear, evil, and hateful control in her efforts to destroy life.  McMurphy, by contrast, is the pure, wild, fire of life itself.  His presence is enough to reawaken the inmates who had been, up until his arrival, the equivalent of living corpses.

90845,4,0790732181,"After seeing the gorgeous Christian Slater in the stage production of this in Edinburgh, I just had to see it again (and compare the performances on stage, to on screen), and of course, any excuse to review it.

This is one of the best 70s films ever - and that's saying something from me, as normally, apart from the rare one, I don't like them. And I'm not normally keen on Jack Nicholson - although I may be getting a minor thing for Christian Slater now. (Guess what that means? Buying all his DVDs!) But for some reason, all the characters in this are wonderful, including the weird-eyebrowed Randall P McMurphy! Others in this include: the up-tight and eccentric Harding (William Redfield), the stuttering Billy Bibbitt (Brad Dourif, who some might recognise, seemingly reprising his role later in the first Urban Legend movie), the innocently child-like Martini (Danny DeVito), and Taber (Christopher Lloyd), all of whom find themselves strangely drawn to the infectious wild nature of McMurphy, who opens their eyes to the joy of life, and in the defining moment of the film, explains that they've been convinced they're crazy, and are no less ordinary than the wackos who roam the streets outside their nest.

If you've seen Girl Interrupted, then this is basically the same, but full of guys, some right, some not, and many of the extras in the background are actual mental patients.

The film is actually based on a book by Ken Kesey, albeit, not a very good book, as I couldn't get my head around it, and put it down after a couple of pages. Ken Kesey said he would never watch the movie version and even sued the movie's producers because it wasn't shown from Chief Bromden's perspective (as the novel is). Apparently, years later, he claimed to be lying in bed flipping through TV channels when he settled onto a late-night movie that looked sort of interesting, only to realize after a few minutes that it was this film. He then changed channels.

Jack Nicholson is brilliant in this, despite the freaky eyebrows. He acts when he doesn't have any lines to say. If you just watch him during the group therapy session, his expressions are terrific, and he just reacts to everything so well.

The film has some unforgettable moments. Who could forget Louise Fletcher's icy stare, Jack Nicholson's smart-aleck remarks or Will Sampson's impressive, almost entirely silent performance?

In the stage production, apart from being gorgeous, Christian Slater had the same mannerisms as Jack Nicholson, and all the cast did brilliantly. McKenzie Crook (Gareth from The Office) played Billy, and although he didn't stutter as much, he played the part, and looked kinda cute at the same time - he suits his hair longer.

The one thing I was disappointed in the stage production, was Christopher Lloyd's character not really being featured - I think his character was incorporated with another one. It's disappointing in the movie too, as he doesn't have that much screen time, but when he does, his face is so funny! I just have two things to say: ""PECULIAR!"" and the cigarette scene all by itself. When I first saw him in this (having practically grown up with the Back To The Future movies), I couldn't believe they were the same guy - he's really nice looking!

There seems to be a lot of tension between Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher) and McMurphy, but I always think if McMurphy could have had his wicked way with her, he would have done! There was a lot of tension in scenes between them, I don't know whether anyone else noticed. But sometimes you just want them to rip each other's clothes off!

The ending to this, I simply can't watch. I've seen it once, and that was enough for me. Like the ending of The Shining, it stays with you. The ending gets me very upset, although I feel it was the right thing to do. I'll watch the rest of the movie quite the thing, but as soon as the ending comes, I'll either hide, or go out the room. It's really powerful.

The movie swept the Oscars in 1975, and is always a favourite among people who were around at the time. Consequently, it's one of my favourites, and would recommend it to anyone.

Now, about Christian Slater - I've seen him in Hard Rain, Robin Hood, True Romance, what else do I need to get where he looks extra cute?!

And another thing - whoever decided that Christian should go topless at least twice in the stage production is a genius!",1092268800,,4409,4.674838709677419

90858,5,0790732181,"Ken Kesey's brilliant novel is perfectly adapted to the screen and expertly directed by Milos Forman.  Within these friendly confines Jack Nicholson gave the performance by which I measure all his others.  Randall Patrick McMurphy is a rebel.  He's anti-establishment.  He likes women and to have a drink and to watch baseball.  In some ways he represents the absolute worst of men, yet at the same time he also represents much of the best in men, and at ALL times he is definitely a ""man's man"".
He has been sent to prison for statutory rape, but he's not particularly remorseful about it because the girl looked and acted older and wanted it.  We should be appalled by McMurphy's attitude, yet Nicholson plays him pretty much the way Kesey wrote him, and we sympathize with him.
McMurphy has earned a trip to the state mental hospital by acting ""a little nuts"" and you recognize by watching that McMurphy is the kind of guy who would not hesitate to ""act a little nuts"" to get off of the hard manual labor of a state pen chain-gang.  But at this mental hospital McMurphy runs up against his worst nightmare: Louise Fletcher's Nurse Ratched.
Louise Fletcher earned her best actress Oscar in one of the most methodically unsympathetic roles in silver screen history.  Nurse Ratched pretends to have the best interests of the patients in mind, yet she is obviously subtly manipulating not only the patients, but also the remainder of the hospital staff to maintain an iron rod of control over her little corner of the universe. Crossing Nurse Ratched is a certain path to disaster for those who are in her sphere.
McMurphy and Ratched cross swords over and over.  It could have become boring or depressing, but we are entertained repeatedly by McMurphy's ingenious or bravura attempts to one-up Nurse Ratched.  Yet SHE is the one who has the power in this universe, and I could only marvel at her as she cold-heartedly crushes the life from McMurphy and the other patients.

90859,5,0790732181,"THE MOVIE ITSELF:
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the one authentically great movie Milos Foreman has ever made (and he has been imitating it ever since).  Anyone familiar with the book will recognize that Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher do not look anything like the descriptions of their characters, and yet they capture the spirit of those characters perfectly.  The action has been moved forward in time fifteen years to 1975.  This is one of Nicholson's best performances.  The movie has an objective, documentary feel to it.  We miss out on some characterization because of this (especially the Chief's) but instead we get a sense of what it would be like in a real institution.  Despite the subject-matter, it is very funny and has moments of true joy.  It is a marvelous piece of 70's filmmaking and ranks as #12 on the IMDB Greatest Movies list.  Definitely worth owning.
THE DVD'S:
The DVD's were made from a new transfer so they look and sound terrific.  Unfortunately, it is a 2-DVD set, but all of the information could have easily fit on one disc.  The only things on the second disc are some deleted scenes and a making-of documentary.  The documentary is good, but not great.  It tells of how Kirk Douglas first discovered the book and tried to make a movie out of it, but not of the friction when his son Michael (the film's producer) told him he was too old to be in it.  There is also no mention of the film's success and its sweep of all the top Oscars.  They don't even talk about novelist Ken Kesey (who supposedly was so against the film he still hasn't seen it).",1087862400,,1592,4.540350877192982
90860,5,0790732181,"Czech director Milos Forman has a fixation for America. Almost all his films, RAGTIME, MAN IN THE MOON, THE PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLINT, focus on what he perceives as essential American qualities: its talent, its racism, its perversions, its freedoms, its inventiveness, and, in the case od ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, its strength of spirit. Jack Nicholson's McMurphy is a criminal, and Forman doesn't hide or sweeten this fact. It's his original sin, so to speak. But the world he is cast into is filled with darker sins: brutality, prejudice, ignorance, and inflexibility. McMurphy initially tries to serve just himself, but in his own way, he reaches out to the other inmates. Maybe not with the greatest of patience, he tries to inform the others that they are not crazy and that all is not lost. And he gives them some strengths that they didn't know they possessed
Phenomenal performances are all over the place: Nicholson will forever be inseparable from McMurphy, as Louise Fletcher will always be Nurse Ratched. But the supporting performances were equally stellar. Will Sampson as the sad-eyed hulk, Chief, was exceptional. But for my money, Brad Dourif's Billy Bibbit is the overlooked gem of a performance. He is the pathetic and forlorn stutterer who befriends McMurphy, and, perhaps for that reason, suffers the most. Dourif would turn in any equally powerful performance in Forman's later film, RAGTIME.
ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is an unforgettable film that no film lover's collection can be without. This set, complete with lots of give-me's (I especially enjoyed ""The Making of..."" portion), is a value at any price.",1087516800,4,1642,5.040441176470588

90862,5,0790732181,"Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ continues to draw record crowds and everyone who has seen it rates it very highly, but One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest may be a more accurate in some ways retelling of the Christ Story.  Most people will never know that this is the Christ story set in contemporary times.  No robes and beards and crosses here, no stereotypical sneering Satan, but instead a story about good and evil, as one of the characters says near the very beginning, ""Its not about my wife.  Its about my life.  Its about good and evil, its about God and the devil!"" and so it is.  Here Satan appears not in red or black, but in white, a nurse!  She has no snarl, but instead speaks softly as she administers medications and follows the rules.  She is an agent of mercy!  And on the other hand was the unshaven McMurphy, the petty crook, the foul mouthed womanizer who enjoyed gambling, smoking, drinking, all the antithesis of the the religious ideal, but then Jeusus too was always unpopular with the religous types.  They called him a glutton and a drunkard and noted that he hung out with prostitutes.  But McMrphy has a good heart!  He is decidely Christ like in his attitudes towards his fellow inmates.  He treats the apparently autistic native American ""chief"" as if he is just one of the boys.  He takes his fellow inmates on a fishing junket and introduces them as ""doctors"".  He has a joyful world view that bends the rules for the sake of humanity.  Not so the nurse!  She follows the rules to the letter!  Their conflict is the whole point of Christianity,  the law versus the Gospel. Here is a film where you can really hate the Satanic and love the Christ like, and the differences between the two are presented in stark contrast.  You can't just observe this film.  You are rooting for McMurphy!
  In Gibson's Passion of the Christ one observes the outrageous abuses suffered by Jesus and feel horror, but when you observe the satanic figure in that film you are not consumed by hate for it.  You are not hoping that Christ will strangle Satan right then and there as you do hope will happen in Cuckoo's Nest, where McMurphy attempts to strangle the God forsaken  nurse.  At the end of the film, the inmates are convinced that the absent McMurphy is ""up there"",  cofounding the authorities.  Now they have faith in McMurphy.  The ""Chief""  acts on his faith,  throws the plumbing through the wall, and escapes as water gushes everywhere.  Christians will remember that the waters of Baptism  free one from the shackles of tyrany.",1081728000,2,2552,4.58980044345898

Every award this movie recieved was well deserved, especially Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher.  (One little word of note.  In the stage play, the role of McMurphy was played by Kirk Douglas.  His son, Michael would work to get the movie on the screen.  Thus, the family connection.)",1081641600,,399,4.549295774647887
90864,5,0790732181,"It has taken me nearly 30 years to get round to watching this film, and I genuinely think I appreciate it more for being that much older. It has had accolades for everything -- plot, direction, filming, casting, acting. It deserves them all. It is nothing short of compulsive. The bad guy who has not lost his soul (much less his spirit) is pitted against the embodiment of sanctimonious righteousness who never had a soul to lose.
I wonder whether Nicholson has even yet had full recognition for the truly great actor he is (how many people have even seen The King of Marvin Gardens, for instance?) His screen presence is enormous, magnetic and menacing. He combines outsize testosteronic individuality with the ability to get inside a character, and an electric sense of threat with a real power to tug at the heart-strings. Bad he may be, but unsympathetic never. He is a very big little guy, but he is still the little guy against the system. It must be impossible, surely, to upstage that?
Incredibly, no. The ultimate star in a film that has no shortage of up-and-coming luminaries as well as Nicholson (D de Vito for one) is Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched. I am never going to forget that mask-like expressionless face and that ever-rational, implacable, ever-modulated voice mouthing those soulless, uncomprehending, the-system-is-right banalities. Above all, I am never going to forget that hair. Among the many touches of genius in this production, that hairstyle is the ultimate. I simply could not take my eyes off it. The name is effective too, and I shall continue to believe until someone proves me wrong that it was an inspired borrowing from Jane Eyre -- the dreadful and sadistic Miss Skatcherd brought up to date and given a 20th-century twist.
This film is never going to become dated as long as these polarities continue to repel each other. I saw it at all only because my son showed it to me. It is relevant to my generation, it is relevant to his, and I can't foresee when it is not going to be relevant.",1076284800,94,2030,4.72112676056338
90865,5,0790732181,"Jack Nicholson was born to play this role, a rebel incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital who realizes he won't get out at the end of his 'jail sentence' because he was committed, i.e., he didn't enter voluntarily - so he's stuck there until the high mucky-mucks determine that he's ""cured."" Nicholson is not the kind of guy to play by the rules, not even to get out of this place, and the more he acts out against the cold attitude of the authorities (Nurse Ratched, in particular, whose name has become synonymous with cruel and implacable persons in authority), the more his fate is sealed.
This fantastic movie, which swept the 1976 Oscars in every main category, is based on Milos Forman's book of the same name. Like the book, the film is filled with memorable characters, and it's hard to believe that they're even acting. In many places, the movie takes on the feel of a documentary; it's that realistic and well-acted.
An iconic and classic movie that will last forever. Its themes are timeless and universal: one man's reaction (with courage, pride, stubbornness, and sacrifice) to a repressive institution .

90866,5,0790732181,"As an uncultured teenager in the age of Bruckheimer, I am  wary of  ""classic"" films, often finding them to  be just too old, too soft, and too boring.

  Cukoo's Nest is an exception to behold. Here is a film that, for once, deserved every last Oscar is received.  Based on Ken  Kesey's wonderful but far more convoluted book, Cukoo's Nest stars Jack Nicolson as R.P. McMurphy, a living-large thrill seeker escaping jail time by acting crazy enough to instituted at a mental ward.
  There we meet a slew of comic performances by offbeat characters, and also the diabolical Nurse Ratched. Ratched runs the whole show with hard fist. I think we've all encountered someone like Nurse Ratched, whose rage and disapproval boil cold until an air of stifling compsure and  soft-spokenness, which is far more arresting than uncontrolled yelling.
  Her and McMurphy inevitably clash, and his reign of disorder inspires the other immates to speak up against the  injusticies of the ward.
  I suppose this is predominantly a ""man"" movie, with lots of  male bonding, male-oriented jokes, and a female protagonist. It's goofy nature and comedy lures us into a tragic and powerful tale of triumph, but the two don't clash one  bit.
  This new DVD edition provides an insightful second disc, and a commentary on the first, which despite its a large party of commentators, doesn't feel crowded. The film certainly doesn't look its 25 years, but the transfer is even more clear. The soundtrack allows us to hear every background groan and rant in detail, and the comedic chaos is rendered comprehensible.

He shakes things up, and makes a lot of friends with the inmates, but a terrible enemy in the form of Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). Nurse Ratched haunted me for years after I first saw this movie...she is one of the most terrifying characters ever to come down the pike. McMurphy challenges her authority (and in the process, greatly underestimates her capacity for pure evil)and her little kingdom, of which she is total ruler...he would have been better off to challenge a serial killer in jail! Her malignant manipulation of poor Billy...one of the most satisfying scenes was when Nicholson was strangling her. Too bad he didn't get to finish! Jack Nicholson turned in on of his best performances (this and Chinatown, my personal favorites). The Indian, called Chief, Martini and all the supporting cast were fabulous. LOVED the fishing trip! When McMurphy comes back the first time, and pretended to be lobotomized, he was great, as was the Chief's reaction...the next time...it was the real deal, and horrifying. My sole criticism is this: At the end, when the Chief is holding McMurphy, prior to putting him out of his misery, he should have remained silent. No words were necessary, the scene was powerful enough on it's own. What a great movie, though...the audience was absolutely soundless at the end...everyone was so moved they could not walk or speak for a few minutes...THAT is a sign of a great story.",1067558400,4,1596,4.9148148148148145

Jack's performance is so strong, it even makes Louise Fletcher's performance as Big Nurse (called Nurse Ratched in the film) seem much better than it really is. (That Fletcher won the Oscar for this film is testimony to the film's narrative potency since she is not that talented an actress, as her subsequent career has revealed.

Jack Nicholson is the embodiment of Randall P McMurphey and richly deserved his oscar as did Louise Fletcher as the sadistic and controlling Nurse Ratched.
This film has humour and pathos and you will find your emotions veering between rage (at the system), pity and empathy whilst laughing aloud at some of the antics of the inmates being led by an anarchic McMurphy.

90875,5,0790732181,"Jack Nicholson's Oscar winning performance as Randle Patrick McMurphy is one of many highlights of this 1975 adaptation of the Ken Kesey novel.  Nicholson's McMurphy is a new inmate in a psychiatric ward who quickly rebels against the oppressive staff (which is personified by Nurse Ratched; played by Louise Fletcher in her Oscar winning role) while making quite an impact on his fellow inmates.  Director Milos Forman populates the film with memorable sequences while the screenplay offers many memorable, and in some cases unforgettable, characters; but none can steal the thunder of Jack Nicholson in the role he was born to play.  The rest of the cast includes Brad Dourif (in his film debut), Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, William Refield, Scatman Crothers, and an unforgettable Will Sampson as people you won't soon forget; and all of whom give superb performances.  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest went on to sweep the Oscar's for all the major award categories (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay) while it solidified itself as a true masterpiece of film.  The film itself hasn't aged a day, and is still as much of a classic today as it was when first released almost thirty years ago.

90888,5,0790732181,"I remember first viewing this superb movie on a wide-screen in 1975 while living in Utah, and the electrifying effect of the final few scenes on everyone in the theater audience. Many people were openly sobbing, including my better half, and even I have to admit to having a few misty moments myself. Indeed, the final few frames made us all want to stand up and shout in exclamation, so powerful was the series of images on the screen. My wife and I talked about it for weeks, and finally went back to see it again. There is no way around it folks, this is a fabulous film, a modern classic that no one in Hollywood had the chutzpah to bring to the screen despite the fact that both the original late Ken Kesey novel and the stage play adaptation were both runaway successes. In 1972 we saw Al Pacino play McMurphy in a wonderful stage production of the work, and was amazed both by the material and the acting.
The play had opened on Broadway to rave reviews, with Kirk Douglas playing the lead part. He stayed long enough to win a Tony as best actor for his performance, and promptly bought the movie rights and began plans to bring this cautionary allegory of modern society to the screen. For years he attempted to gain backing, but despite his box office appeal and hi sown reputation, was unable to convince anyone that he was the man to play McMurphy. Finally, he dropped the script and moved on to other projects, including his work in the tragically ignored performance in Elia's Kazan's ""The Arrangement"", which also deals with both cultural alienation and mental illness, as does OFOTCN. It wasn't, however, until Kirk's son Michael blew the dust off the manuscript of the screenplay and employed the legendary Milos Foreman to direct it, and also convinced Jack Nicholson to commit to the project that the Douglas family production team were able to bring the project to fruition.
Why go through all this history? Simply to show what a wonderful gift this film is for the movie-going public.  Randall Patrick McMurphy, malingerer and petty career mal-content, believes he has discovered the perfect way to spend his latest sentence, avoiding the drudgery of prison by feigning mental illness to get assigned for diagnostic workup and possible treatment in a state mental institution, not realizing that the time spent there does not count toward his sentence. Thinking he has the perfect place to hide, he soon begins to realize the institution is in complete control of his time, energy, and consciousness. Given his inability to submit or conform, he is soon locked in the battle of his life for his self-control, his self-hood, and his very sanity. The setting is an allegory of what modern society is like, and how it imposes its priorities, its view of reality, and its demands for how we participate both within it as well as with each other. As we come to care about what happens to McMurphy and the whole zany crew of loveable loonies, we also recognize McMurphy is on a dangerous and unavoidable collision course with Big Nurse Ratched (played magnificently by Louise Fletcher).
The movie is supported by a stellar cast, including Danny DeVito, Will Sampson, Scatman Crothers, and Christopher Lloyd. The scenery is gorgeous, as the primitive and open landscape of the Oregon coastline provides a contrasting world of order and beauty to the hellhole the mental ward seems to be. A turning point in the movie comes when McMurphy discovers he is the only involuntary in-patient, the only one who cannot walk out by simply signing some forms and collecting his clothes. Nicholson's amazing facial turns of expression graphically show what he is so desperately feeling, the final glimpse of land by a man going down into the water for the last time! The script is by turns hilarious, literate, plausible, and totally devastating. This is a modern classic, and one you should certainly have in your DVD library.

90889,5,0790732181,"If I recall correctly, Kirk Douglas tried for many years to produce a film based on Ken Kesey's novel. He failed but son Michael succeeded and as its producer, accepted the Academy Award for the best film of 1975. Nicholson and Fletcher also received Oscars for best actor and best actress, respectively. The focal point of the film is, of course, Randle P. McMurphy (Nicholson) who may or may not deserve to be confined in an insane asylum ruled (in effect) by nurse Mildred Ratched (Fletcher). When I think about Nurse Ratched, I am reminded of an observation by Thelonious Monk: ""You know what's the loudest noise in the world, man? The loudest noise in the world is silence."" Given her absolute authority, she almost never says anything whereas McMurphy almost immediately becomes the unofficial (and self-appointed) spokesman for the other inmates. His confrontations with Ratched are inevitable. The resolution of their final conflict is among the most chilling revelations I have ever experienced in a film. Perhaps I should have seen it coming but I didn't.
Oddly, much of the narrative involves several activities which are quite entertaining and even hilarious. For example, somehow McMurphy manages to flee the asylum with the other inmates, arranging so that he and they can take a day cruise with some of McMurphy's ""friends."" Of course the inmates thoroughly enjoy themselves. He also organizes basketball games in which the key player is Chief Bromden (Will Sampson), a Native American who never speaks and who seems to be at least ten feet tall. But there are other moments which are quite serious, indeed tragic. Brad Dourif deserved his nomination for an Academy Award for supporting actor (in the role of Billy Bibbit) and all others in the supporting cast are also first-rate. When I first saw this film, the character Martini caught my eye so I waited for the credits to learn the name of the actor who played him: Danny DeVito.
Nicholson and Fletcher are brilliant. I've always thought hers to be the more difficult role because it places more limits on her talents than Nicholson's does on his. Stated another way, the McMurphy part gives Nicholson more opportunities to use those remarkable talents. Also, Nicholson's personality seems comparable with McMurphy's in certain respects (e.g. spontaneous, impish, confrontational, playful, quick-witted) whereas it is inconceivable to me that, other than gender, Fletcher and Ratched have anything in common.
Kirk Douglas has never missed an opportunity to say how proud he is of son Michael's career and especially of what he achieved as producer of this film. Yes, those are the sentiments of a father but Kirk Douglas has also had a very distinguished career of his own as a producer, director, and actor. He understands better than does almost anyone else what is required to create a great film such as this.",1058400000,2,2883,5.03347280334728
90890,5,0790732181,"This is my favorite movie of all time. I'm not saying it is the greatest ever made- there are many more titles that could easily vie for that title. Unlike many other classic works of cinematic art, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST doesn't break ground in its camera work or composition. There are very few memorable shots visually or technically speaking. However, director Forman knows what to do: he gets out of the way and lets his actors tell the captivating story filled with sacrifice and rough grace. The story's universal theme of the individual courageously fighting for identity against ""the machine"" inspires while entertaining. A feat few contemporary movies successfully pull off.
CUCKOO'S NEST is an actor's movie. The ensemble work here by Nicholson, Fletcher, Lloyd, Redfield, Lassick, Sampson, Devito and the rest is among the finest ever captured. Not a false note plays in any of the performances. These actors fully inhabit the skins of these characters and therefore, create three dimensional people that connect spiritually and fully to the audience's empathy.
The script is air tight as it oscillates between comedy and tragedy. This occurs often not only in the same scene but in the same take. The film compliments the novel nicely (but exist in completely different spheres), although much of the books surreal symbolism is lost in favor of a clear linear narrative. The film also shifts the point of view from Chief's (in the novel) to McMurphy.  Many of my favorite lines in film history are in this movie. ""Least I tried, G*******t, least I did that!"" is a motto that has guided my life.
When viewed with its near twin COOL HAND LUKE (my third favorite film of all time), one can see the possibly dated, but no less intriguing subtext of the criminal/prisoner as savior. Many souls are saved as a direct result of McMurphy's (and Luke's) ultimate sacrifice.
The film is entertaining, enlightening and reflective without the slightest hint of pretension.
A brief note about this special edition two disc DVD: the behind the scenes material only briefly mentions author Ken Kesey. There is no footage of him weighing in with his experiences writing the original novel. This is criminal.  I know the late Kesey disowned this film and I don't blame him considering the experience he had. However the producers and screenwriter virtually ignore the brilliant Oregonian who wrote one of America's greatest novels.

With each viewing (I've seen the film probably 30+ times) it appears as fresh and beautiful as the first. A definite 10 out of 10 must own contemporary classic.",1058400000,4,2598,4.981566820276497
90891,5,0790732181,"Though the movie has some plot holes in it, it completely makes up for it with the action and range of emotions that run along with it.  Everything from anger to happy to funny to sad.  As to answer some of the questions that some people asked about the film such as: ""is it legal to do labotomy?""  Yes it was legal to do labotomy to problem patients, but that was a long time ago.  Though I beleive the doctors would have thought long and hard for the treatment they would have provided it is not impossible for an aggressive clinic to give shock therapy to problem patients and labotomy.  It just seems ridiculous nowadays because we know better, the law protects us and we simply understand such acts are inhumane.  Shock therapy was given to patients who misbehaved frequently and as a control they would shock them.  Some doctors did feel Jack was a problem so they shocked him.  That was not unusual back then either.  Neither was lobotomy and yes it was legal back then as well.  It is not legal anymore.  The idea of lobotomy back then was to have patients have less aggressive behavior.  However, those who gave it less stars because of they are basing judgement on nowaday morals and laws they are wrong because labotomy was perfectly legal and so was shock therapy (which is still now I believe.)  The point of the movie was to make you feel something and feel sympathy for Jack because of his character shows that you don't need all those shock therapy, labotomy, pills to make a person better mentally.  Jacks character did it by providing happiness and friendship to the other patients in the clinc which kinda like Patch Adams accomplished in that movie.

The problem I have with the story is that the main character, a lively bonvivant, who encourages at least one of the others to abandon their fear ultimately lets himself become a victim.  This is hard to believe for me, that a street-wise, life-loving person has so little sense of self-preservation.
The peformances are great here though all around and the movie is gripping and ultimately life affirming.",1055116800,3,617,4.651376146788991
90893,5,0790732181,"I agree with many of the other reviews-- great acting, compelling story, excellent picture and sound quality.
However, what I found most intriguing was the parable that lies just below the surface.  When McMurphy discovers that almost all of the other ""crazies"" were there *voluntarily*, he can't believe it.  Why would anyone give up their power and freedom for the humiliation and abuse that Nurse Ratched dishes out?
The asylum is not a physical prison-- it is easy enough to get in and out.  It is a mental prison, a prison of the mind.  The other characters are there because they believe they *need* to be there, that they are not normal because of the fears and insecurities that bind them.  Even the Chief, who is physically dominating, believes that he is powerless, until McMurphy comes along.
This is the parable.  People who live with fear and insecurity, people who do not accept themselves for who they are, are living in their own mental prison.  As a result, they become powerless and victims of abuse.  Only when they start believing in themselves again, just as the Chief does, can they experience the freedom to soar with their own God-given powers.  ""I feel as big as a mountain.""  This message of hope is what draws me back to the movie time and again.",1052352000,2,1273,4.693693693693693
90894,5,0790732181,"If I had to pick any three DVDs to take with me to a desert island, ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" would for sure top the list. It is an electrifying and compelling story of one man against the system, and unlike a lot of other 70's dramas, never seems dated.
Since most people interested have already seen the movie, it would be pointless for me to give a synopsis. But what cannot be over emphasized is the strong performances from both Jack Nicholson in the lead role as a petty crook commited to a mental institution, and Louise Fletcher as the cold and blunt nurse. Much of the movie centers around the duality between them, and it makes for some great dialogue. Nicely rounding out the cast is a young Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd, obviously in the springtime of their careers.
I held off from getting this movie on DVD because the earlier version was bare-bones and was a mediocre transfer. This newly released 2 DVD set is a fantastic buy, with a whole new video and sound transfer that makes you forget that 25 years have passed since it was made. This is by far the best print ever released. The extras also add good measure, such as the documentary (which is a shorter version of the one found on the laserdisc edition) and full-length commentary from the Director and Producers. While the extras aren't exactly overflowing in this edition, they are worth the price of admission.
""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" remains one of the most entertaining and important films ever made, and like other classics such as ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Godfather"", will stand the test of time. It is funny, moving, and tough-provoking, which is a rareity in modern cinema. This new DVD edition is what movie buffs have been waiting for, and is so far the only thing coming close to a definative version.

90895,5,0790732181,"Since every professional reviewer in the business has probably reviewed this movie,  there's not much new that I can come up with in the categories of acting quality, plot analysis, or technical quality that hasn't already been discussed.
Then, what new can I bring to the table? My emotional reactions to ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is what I have to offer. Did I like it or not? Did it make me laugh? Did it make me want to weep? Was I emotionally attracted to, or repulsed by, any of the characters? In a nutshell, the answer to all of these questions is yes. It's the why of these emotional reactions that makes me want to review it.
First of all, it works on multiple levels. It works as a comedy and it works as a tragedy. It makes you love and it makes you hate. It puts your empathy to work, and it makes you hate.
Blind rigid authority is here in the person of Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched. (My friends and I referred to her as Nurse Rat S..t. It's been a while, but I think McMurphy did too.) Her authoritarian, uncaring, by the rules, mentality harmed, in one way or another, every one of her patients. With Nurse Ratched on duty there would be no happiness tolerated.
Love of life, and ""in your face"" rejection of authority is what Randle McMurphy, played by Jack Nicholson, is made of. Amazingly, his rebellion, coupled with comaraderie did more for his fellow mental ward patients than years of Nurse Ratched's untender unloving care.
Nicholson and his impish grin arranged for ""outings"" and ""entertainments"" for his co-patients that were definitely against all the rules, but which provided the happiest times that any of these patients had ever had. They also provided temporary ""cures"" from what ailed them. It was in these scenes that the movie was a comedy. In one scene, he introduces the entire group as a doctors on tour, and, amazingly, they became the epitome of doctors on an outing. Another bit of high (or perhaps low) comedy was when he managed to arrange to have a group of women snuck into the ward to ""entertain"" his companions.
As well as working as a comedy, the movie certainly works as a tragedy. McMurphy may have won a few battles, but Nurse Ratched won the war. In this war, McMurphy was the chief casualty. If there is anyone reading this who hasn't seen the movie, I won't spoil it by telling you the form her revenge takes (and revenge it is).  Although some professional reviewers discuss the climax in detail, I think it is better to see it yourself for maximum impact.
A performance that many reviewers, both professional and amateur, seem to have only occasionally mentioned in passing was that of Will Sampson as Chief Bromden. He had me believing that he really was catatonic. So much so that I was shocked when he finally spoke.
What else can I say? Someone to love, someone to hate - something to laugh at, something to become outraged over - a cast of supporting players that includes such stars and stars in the making as Scatman Crothers, Danny DeVito, and Christopher Lloyd in small parts.",1049846400,2,3050,4.584249084249084

In the book, the story was told from the point of view of Chief, so that you could see the reason that he was so crazy and because some of the main themes were things that Chief thought in his head and were not expressed in the movie.  Even though i liked the book more, i thought that the movie was amazing.

'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' is a very ironical and psychologically intensive movie. The main character, McMurphy, fakes insanity and is put in a mental asylum, where a battle of wills starts immediately between him and nurse Ratched. The movie is about freedom. In nurse Ratched's opinion, being free is a crime; in McMurphy's opinion, being free is the only way to be.
McMurphy must be Jack Nicholson's best role, and the other actors are outstanding as well. The movie is very atmospheric; a certain nervousness can be felt throughout it.

90912,5,0790732181,"Milos Forman has always had a knack for assembling great ensemble casts. This is particularly true in his most critically acclaimed releases (Taking Off, Amadeus and this film). It would be difficult indeed to come up with actors and actresses who were better suited to fill the roles in OFOTCN. This is true in terms of both the stars, Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher, and the secondary characters. Who could have been a better Harding than William Redfield? A better Billy Bibbit than Brad Dourif? A better Cheswick than Sydney Lassick? And most especially, a better Chief Bromden than Will Sampson?
  I rank this movie as the best of the  best of what I consider to be American Cinema's golden decade, the 70s. It certainly won the widest acclaim, with its sweep of the major Oscars for 1975 (Nicholson also won best actor from the New York Film Critics voters that year).
  Not to be overlooked is the fantastic job performed by the film's adaptors, Bo Goldman and Lawrence Hauben, who also won Oscars for their screenplay. True, they did have a fairly decent stage version (by Dale Wasserman) to work with. I remember seeing an excellent production of the play, with a terrific cast, in San Francisco circa 1972. Just as an aside, I read in the Norton Critical edition of the novel, a review of a NY production of the play by Walter Kerr that was an absolute pan. Suffice it to say that the movie is much different than either the novel or the play. Those familiar with Kesey's great novel understand how difficult a transfer from page to screen would be; about a third of the story is Bromden's delusional interior monologue. The final script, quite rightly, focuses almost exclusively on Randal P McMurphy's struggle with Nurse Ratched for the hearts and minds of the inmates.
  This is truly a gut and soul-wrenching movie, with many moments of high maniacal comedy interspersed. Though many of his other films are top-notch, this is Forman's masterpiece.

Here is a tip for blind purchacers of this dvd:
From the start of the long piece of music after the disk loads, press the down arrow twice then press enter.  After that, press down arrow once then press enter.  After the start of the music, press enter again.  This gets you to the commentary.  To get to the french version, press the down arrow three times rather than twice.  To start playback from the disk load, press enter at the start of the long piece of music.

I hated Nurse Ratchet with a passion, which only made me respect Fletcher and her amazing portrayal of her.

One thing that struck me watching the movie after all these years is how director Milos Foreman never misses an expression in every scene.

90935,5,0790732181,"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest was a most unique, Academy Award winning film. Never before have I witnessed a motion picture where a character such as R.P. McMurphy, as well portrayed by Jack Nicholson, is admitted into a mental institution and as a patient quickly sees the lack of care administered by the available nurses and doctors. Quite disturbing is the idea that he is not formally educated and yet is the only one who truly sees the underlying problems that prevent the psychiatric ward from becoming a well-run facility. Also troubling is seeing that his attempts to address any concerns or solutions to the administrators are met with responses in the nature of ""Don't bother trying to help us, little man. We know what's best for you and your kind"".
The cold attitudes and retorts that McMurphy and the rest of the patients deal with are primarily expressed by the head nurse,  Mildred Ratched, who is the mouthpiece of the doctors and staff. As a medical worker and as a person, she keeps herself both physically and emotionally at more than an arm's distance from the patients. She is there to recite and strictly enforce her interpretation of the rules and regulations of the hospital, many of which are questionable and seem to be adding to the detriment as opposed to the benefit of each patient. Anyone who questions Nurse Ratched will often be replied to by her soft-spoken but inflexible demands that the rules are established and that changing them or bending them a little for maybe just one evening is unacceptable.
Throughout the movie, Nurse Ratched and the rest of the staff seem to carry out this passive aggressive power trip of not just enforcing the rules but also tossing all the patients' concerns to the side and then fitting them around all the regulations present. Instead of acknowledging that their strict interpretations might be preventing the mentally ill from receiving the help that they need, they simply gloss over their lack of expressed concern or performance and believe that having everyone simply comply with the enforced hospital codes will be a fix-all.
This classic is one of the most thought-provoking films I have ever seen, and it is regarded as a display of individualism versus institutional conformity. More explicitly, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is also a personification of how truly dealing with the heart of the matter can come into conflict with an institutionalized strict, letter-by-letter, interpretation of due process.
And for those, including myself, who sometimes serve as figures of authority, there is a stark, but very important, theme that appears to emanate from this film. It is the following: There can be a very thin line between true professional conduct and that which does not quite qualify as such, even when intentions are good.",1034985600,,2818,4.957716701902749

They were richly deserved as Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher and Milos Forman are all outstanding. The film is based on the Ken Kesey novel and takes place in a state mental institution. Mr. Nicholson is R.P. McMurphy who is a convict and decides it's better to spend some time in the loony bin instead of jail. Once in, he stirs the pot and locks horns with the iron-fisted Nurse Ratched played by Ms. Fietcher. The film, as the book, looks at the rigidness of the so called establishment and it's goal of making everyone, through whatever means necessary, conform to its rules. Mr. Nicholson brings a manic energy and charm to the role of R.P. McMurphy. Ms. Fletcher is menacing as the evil Nurse Ratched and Brad Dourif is superb as a mental patient. Mr. Forman paints with broad strokes and he pushes things to extremes.",1033516800,6,1029,4.5978260869565215

90938,5,0790732181,"Upon viewing this movie it becomes immediately apparent that
the pathology resides even more in the doctors, nurses and administrators of the mental hospital than with the patients.
As we get to know the patients, it occurs to us that most of
them are just a bit eccentric and have been placed in this hospital -or in some cases have even placed themselves there -
because society is intolerant of all those who can not neatly adapt to
the discipline of the 9 to 5 organization man and his protestant work ethic.  The hospital personnel intends to ""help"" people by making them good cogs in the machine.  To the extent that there is anything ""wrong"" with the patients, it is ""the machine"" and the ""help"" that has driven them to a poor state of being.  In other words, the medicine is not only worse than the disease, it IS the disease.
Nurse Cratchett may even have good intentions, but she cannot tolerate individuality or other peoples desires...these must be controlled and follow the regulations to the letter.  She is your typical control ... and when McMurphy reacts violently
to her mainacal control and evil consequences it has for the young stuttering patient, he is the one penalized, not her.  We all know a Nurse Cratchett...she tells us to become accountants instead of musicians. In fact, this mental hospital is a microcosm of society at large, a machine that wants to create false desires, distort or suppress true desires in order to
perpetuate the socio-ecomomic machine as it is.
Now Ken Kesey who wrote the novel upon which this movie was based
had a first hand look at all of this.  He worked in a psychiatric ward when he was a graduate student at Stanford.
He was also very concerned about the shackles placed on our minds, not necessarily by this or that individual, but as an epiphenomenon of our society.  He sought to break free of these shackles and, to that end started, the Merry Pranksters, travelling around America distributing LSD...as a means of liberating the mind.  I was happy to see in a documentary done for the history channel (The History of LSD) that he held this view of the liberatory nature of LSD to the end of his life.
This classic film was a milestone in his evolution and must be seen by all generations to come.  All the actors, not just Nicholson (we know he is great), are wonderful!

Nicholson plays an eccentric who is forced to stay at a psych ward. It's there that he begins to make his co-nutties feel a little bit better about themselves. He ends up becoming the nemesis of the head nurse, and she counters by making his life a living hell. The end of the film will shock you and make you feel resentment towards the authorities in the hospital.

90940,4,0790732181,"In this multi-Academy award winning flick based on Ken Kesey's novel, actor Jack Nicholson as jail-bird Randle P. McMurphy seeks escape from the prison work farm by feigning madness.  He is committed to a psychiatric ward for the mentally disturbed for evaluation while the staff try to determine whether his behaviour is genuine insanity or mere rebellion.  But being with the mentally ill isn't as rosy as McMurphy imagined it to be, particularly under the repressive regime operated by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).  In the battle of mind-games with Ratched, McMurphy discovers that even a simple thing as watching the World Series is impossible, because it might disturb the patients' routine.

Only three movies have ever taken out all five major Academy awards (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Screenplay), and ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" is one of that elite group.  To say that the acting is superb is an understatement.  It takes a lot of talent to convincingly portray someone mentally disturbed, but this cast accomplishes it with brilliance.  The supporting roles as nearly as terrific as the leading roles: Sydney Lassick as the shaky inarticulate Charlie Cheswick, Brad Dourif as the stuttering virgin Billy Bibbit, Danny DeVito as the infantile Martini, Christopher Lloyd as the wide-eyed trouble-maker Tabor, William Redfield as the eloquent intellectual Dale Harding, and Will Sampson as the mute Indian giant.

But the mentally ill are depicted not merely as objects for examination and pity, but with genuine sympathy as victims under an oppressive regime.  Admittedly they're also the source for warm humor; Highlights include McMurphy's commentary of an imaginary baseball game with all the ""nuts"" cheering, and McMurphy's creative introduction of all patients as ""doctors"" from the mental institution as they hijack a fishing boat.  Those who work with the mentally disturbed in real life will be the first to tell you that you need a sense of humor in dealing with them.  But humor doesn't exclude compassion, and this movie raises serious questions about the treatment of the mentally ill.

Everything is geared towards arousing sympathy for the mentally disturbed: minimalist music and silence, dreary colors, bright lighting, and male care-givers who are police-like unnamed uniforms.  These factors combine to create an atmosphere that conveys a clinical and sterile environment devoid of compassion for those who need it.  Nurse Ratched is depicted as a cold and distant woman without feelings for those in her charge, and her authoritarian role personifies an establishment that cares little for the mentally ill.  Rather than show compassion for the weak, she uses therapy sessions to uncover whatever hope and spirit they have and destroy it.  McMurphy's embodiment of this human spirit is somewhat exaggerated (the way he initiates interest in basketball games and escapes on a fishing expedition is not entirely plausible), but it makes the point.  Interestingly, some have seen the movie as a social criticism on all oppression of the human spirit, with a broad application even to ideologies like communism.  As others have said: tyranny has many faces, and the story of freedom from oppression goes beyond the walls of a mental asylum.

The criticism of the handling of the mentally ill is most evident in how the institution handles McMurphy.  We identify with McMurphy because we know his insanity is faked, and yet the ""treatment"" he receives is thoroughly troubling, especially when those in charge resort to electric-shock therapy.  Is there a parallel in the way that many social problems (eg depression, ADD) are today diagnosed as mental illnesses and treated with drugs?  The tragic way in which McMurphy's ""mental illness"" is mishandled at the conclusion arouses righteous anger, and is a disturbing indictment on all mistreatment of the mentally ill.  There is no crowd-pleasing feel-good ending as his attempt to topple the establishment fails.  Yet the lack of a happy ending makes his criticisms of the establishment all the more piercing.

The movie was rated R for frequent profanity/blasphemy, crude sexual talk and one violent scene at the end (there are also scenes involving alcohol, suicide, an incident where sexual promiscuity is applauded, and an implied endorsement of mercy killing).  The violence and language is deliberately distasteful and one can hardly feel sympathy for McMurphy as an immoral criminal (he is a convicted rapist, rebels against authority, sets up a gambling casino, and encourages Billy to lose his virginity).  Yet one has to feel sympathy for him as he is abused by an inhumane establishment that is equally criminal in its own way by failing to show genuine compassion for those entrusted in its care.  If McMurphy's character is distasteful and criminal, so is the character of care given to the mentally ill.  Rather than become sidetracked by McMurphy's failings, we need to take a serious look at the failings of the establishment as embodied in Ratched.  The tragic consequences (represented by Billy's death & McMurphy's lobotomy) of these failings are just as horrific as the consequences of an immoral life.  Understood in this way, this movie is much more than a vindication of the free human spirit and an endorsement of rebellious anti-authoritarianism.  More importantly it functions as a biting criticism against the abuse of authority to crush that spirit.  This is not a pleasant movie to watch, but it packs a powerful philosophical punch and raises profound questions that are more enduring than mere entertainment.

The conclusion does offer a note of hope, as the silent Indian escapes the cuckoo's nest (perhaps a metaphor of true freedom being found in escaping the establishment and modern institutionalized civilization?).  But we are still left with disturbing questions about those who do not escape: Would we really want our family members in a place like this?  This is a disturbing movie that raises disturbing questions about the treatment of the disturbed - but questions that need to be asked ... and answered. - GODLY GADFLY",1029369600,18,6184,5.223684210526316

Based on Ken Kesseys`novel,Jack Nicholson is MacMurphy,the rebellious con willing to spend time in a mental institution to avoid hard labor on a work farm. But what at first seems like a great idea becomes a life and death struggle between him and the Big Nurse,Louise Fletcher,for the very hearts and minds of the men in the ward.

Even as MacMurphy struggles against this overwhelming authority,we get a glimpse into a world that many never wish to see yet these men are here....damaged souls with the life crushed out of them by one thing or another,their stories are just as important as the main characters are.

At the heart of this film is Cheif Broom,a huge indian seemingly a deaf mute,who really is here because he chooses not to deal with the true insanity of modern life. As a friendship blossoms between the two,the stakes become even higher and lead to one of the most funny yet heartbreaking series of scenes ever filmed.

A film that takes you on a journey that begins with laughter and ends with tragedy yet provide a sense of hope,hope that the human spirit though sometimes lost and confused,can and will somehow triumph. There are very few films that pack the emotional punch that this one does.

Director Milos Forman,with great Oscar winning turns by Nicholson,Louise Fletcher,won for best director,best film and best screenplay becoming one of only a select few films in history to sweep every major catagory.

Over ten years later Milos Forman made a film version of Kesey's book. Also an instant classic. It's a story about friendship, courage, cruelty, and sanity. Admittedly the film did not take on the mental health institutions the way the novel did, but the film did create one of our most coldest and memoriable villains, Nurse Ratchett. And everyone knows Chief. Forman and D.O.P. Haskell Wexler shot the film in a bleak style. Nicholson gave one of his best performances, as did Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratchett (both won Academy Awards for their performances). There is a great supporting cast, including two superb performances by Danny DeVito and Brad Dourif. This film won many awards. Truly one of the greatest movies of all times, and while I wouldn't say it is better than Kesey's book (it isn't), I would suggest that everyone read the novel and watch the film.
As for the dvd, it was a bit of a letdown. There is no commentary or behind the scenes. Just the movie and a few pages of production notes (which actually were quite interesting).

90981,4,0790732181,"I read an article the other day by an evangelical theologian in which he lambasted Harry Potter, suggesting as one of his chief criticisms that Potter was a 'morally ambiguous' character and therefore unsuitable. What amazed me is that he seemed ignorant of the fact that every story thrives on those sorts of ambiguities, not least the story of the Bible which, I suggest, offers very few characters who could serve as role models without qualification. Might I mention Moses, Esther and David as just three 'morally ambigious' characters (and heroes, at that) of the Old Testament. I mention this because I can imagine (and I think I recall actually hearing) 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' being rejected by a Christian critic on precisely those grounds.
Randle P. McMurphy is rebellious, licentious and from a Christian perspective, immoral. He is a violent criminal, a rapist, and yet he emerges as the hero out of this tale of a man's struggle against the establishment. McMurphy finds himself fighting against an institution which imprisons its members within a regime designed only to make them conform and serve the interests of the institution, though ostensibly for the wellbeing of the members; a regime kept alive by depriving the members of the truth about who they are; a regime in which dependency and conformity are maintained through deception and indoctrination.
It was in the day when Erving Goffmann published his famous sociological study, 'Asylums,' that 'Cuckoo's Nest' had its genesis, though the film's comment goes beyond criticising merely mental institutions and their inhumane treatment of human beings. It is a vigorously anti-establishment film which rails against injustice and oppression by showing us a man's attempt to escape conformity, however ambiguous some of his actions might be when viewed in a moral light. But so compelling is the portrayal of life in a mental institution that one can scarcely ignore the warnings the film has for society. People - in fact, Christians - need to pay attention.
I suspect that Christian critics who have found rape, violence and attempted murder (rightly) distasteful and rejected this film on that basis, have shot themselves in the foot. For whilst there is uproar about McMurphy's failings and the wrongness of his rebellious ways, a very revealing fact emerges. Why no uproar over the equally morally ambigious (and objectionable) character of Nurse Ratched? Why do the same critics not rally against her failings and the wrongness of her manipulative and malicious schemes which, ultimately, have far more disastrous consequences than McMurphy's actions (namely, Billy's death and McMurphy's labotomy)? The answer is that she belongs to the system, that she is middle-class, respectable, that she has authority, and therefore it scarcely occurs that we ought to be questioning her moral culpability or otherwise. Therein lies the revealing fact: that the evangelical critic has his agenda shaped far more by the system of this world - dare I say it, by the middle classes, even - than by honest, unbiased reflection.
So I do not say that the moral tone of the film is pleasant. But I do suggest that in the end Nurse Ratched comes out by far the more guilty of the two main protaganists, and this ought to prompt the Christian critic to ask what the film might have to say about the way society is ordered - even if it makes him a little uncomfortable about some of his less defensible presuppositions.",1006128000,9,3487,5.055555555555555

The setting was exceptional and the characters were funny. This is a kind of comedy that is not laughing at the mentally disturbed people, but that shows the other side of their sickness. They want their freedom, they don't know what to choose, and all other details make them interesting characters. We pity them when the guards are mean to them and we finally hate the guards. In normal movies, it would have been the opposite;the patients would be dangerous and the guards would be the good guys. This would be like telling to the audience''those sick people are dangerous.

90985,5,0790732181,"This film belongs on a short list of the best American movies ever made. Jack Nicholson plays Randle P. McMurphy, a small-time convict who feigns insanity for a transfer to a mental hospital, which he thinks will be an easier place to do his time. On the contrary, he finds himself in conflict with Nurse Rached (Louise Fletcher), who seems to be more interested in control than therapy. This film is in the same vein as ""Cool Hand Luke"": the protagonists of both films are irrepressible individuals whose refusal (or inability) to acknowledge authority puts them squarely into direct conflict with a system that ultimately destroys them physically without conquering their spirits. ""Cuckoo's Nest,"" however, is even better than that fine film. The entire cast is excellent, but Nicholson is astonishing.

The character 'Randall P. McMurphy' is so beautfully played by him that you actually think the movie's about Jack Nicholson.
He's a criminal who's been convicted. He fakes insanity and is sent to The State Mental Institution for treatment.
This movie is about the mental patients and how they deal with their day-to-day lives. What they look like in the real sense, what they eat, what they do for recreation, how they can't get along with each other. There are a lot of funny things attached to the same as well. The beauty of the movie is that it depicts so many things and yet it is so plain and simple. It also says that in order to do something great and different in life you have to be free in the mind, you have to think freely!

90988,5,0790732181,"I liked this movie even better than the book upon which it is based. I grew up in the Soviet Union, and that is where I saw the movie for the first time, long after it was released in the States. Jack Nicholson played his role to perfection.
This movie can be emotionally hard to watch. It depicts an insane asylum as a metaphor for totalitarian society. In such a society the notion of individual human dignity does not exist. The Big Nurse takes care of people's survival, but this survival is not much more than vegetation--the human spirit is broken. We see that people fall into the hands of such society, when their spirits are already at their lowest and they see no point in living actively and productively, but simply live out the rest of their days--physical survival is all that remains to them. Against this despiritualization and humiliation Jack Nicholson's character muster up his humor and his unruly ways. It is tragic, sad, and thoughtful. Yet the end is also hopeful.
This movie is relevant for any country, for even in the most free society, there are people who are dead or are dying inside. And even in such free societies there are well-wishing, order-promoting ""nurses"" who kill the spirit and almost force the good to become insane.",996537600,,1258,4.6968325791855206

While there he meets the silently monsterous Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) who has the other patients in her pocket. McMurphy takes it upon himself to fight against the regime the others have become institutionalised to. It seems to have inspired fantastic performances from all of the cast some of whom have become A-list stars like Danny De-Vito. It also contains a pre-Chucky Brad Dourif, and future member of the Addams Family Christopher Lloyd. I cannot recommend this film highly enough.

90990,5,0790732181,"When a movie sweeps the Oscars, you expect it to be good.  But what you might not expect is the pure joy you'll feel watching Nicholson as McMurphy take on Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratchet.  Nicholson plays a tramp, a drifter and a fighter who found himself locked up in prison.  Only he didn't feel much like staying there so he acted a little nuts and got himself some soft time at the mental institute.  As soon as he shows up he begins shaking things up, defying everything around him, as is his nature.  What slowly develops is an all out war between McMurphy and the head nurse at his ward, and what's at stake is the souls and personalities of every inmate on the hall.  Nicholson is a wonder to watch and the story his story is touching, funny, charismatic and hauntingly memorable.  The ending scene will have you either weeping or cheering depending on how you take it (and no, I can't explain that comment, but you'll see), but either way it will give you goose bumps all over.

90992,3,0790732181,"First a quick synopsis of the movie - a criminal (in a marvelous performance by Jack Nicholson) ""pretends"" to be insane to get out of prison and spend his sentence in a mental hospital.  When he discovers that he's stuck in the hospital until he's certified sane by his doctors (rather than the length of his sentence) he plans to break out, with the help of selected fellow patients.  Along the way, his acts of rebellion against authority become a type of therapy for the patients, much more effective than that delivered by the medical staff.
This movie won a number of awards, and seems brilliant and refreshing today, given the claptrap Hollywood is currently producing.  While I do not think Louise Fletcher's performance is great, most would disagree, including the Academy.  The other performances are all brilliant, starting with Nicholson, and moving right down the list through the supporting characters.
The movie, while brilliant, is not always entertaining.  It's not perfect, and there are parts that are even mundane, which lowers its score slightly from the 5-star level.  The quality of the DVD drops it to three stars.  The sound and picture are both not very good - I have 1950's B-grade movies with higher quality.  The extras are non-existent.  Surely a movie with such a pedigree and of such importance artistically deserves better!  At least the price reflects this, but let's hope they come out with a better DVD version of this film.",994809600,,1459,4.918367346938775
90993,5,0790732181,"We are expecting Jack Nicholson and we have Jack Nicholson. The film is great in itself to show how psychiatric hospitals are prisons, even voluntary prisons, when patients are made to believe that they are not ready to leave and go back home. It is also great to show how the patients become dependent on the hospital, the medication, the treatment and the personnel by being deprived of all control over their life or lives. They cannot decide anything, even by voting, even by having a majority in that vote. The personnel is ready to make the beds and the chairs vote in order for the patients not to have a majority. Even the simple things like cigarettes, television, card games or even taking a nap at will are denied or rationed to the patients and they become at least social vegetables, and at times physical vegetables. Jack Nicholson arrives in there as a tornado and creates havoc. He is absolutely perfect for the part, maybe because he plays a part he knows perfectly well, or maybe even because he plays his own personal part. And of course the system defends itself, lobotomizes Jack Nicholson and everything goes back to normal.
But the film is a metaphor of America, because only one will escape this hell : the Indian, who made everyone believe he was deaf and dumb. Indians are reduced to silence. But he escapes because he is stronger than anyone else, which means that he stayed because his world had disappeared, because his civilization had been destroyed. But he escapes and runs away across the countryside at dawn. This is in itself the central metaphor of the film : to be free you have to escape this society. To be free an Indian has to escape this white prison. But he escapes into a vast prairie, the vast prairie, and he runs away into that prairie in some surreal light : this is of course a metaphor of death and paradise for Indians. Hence there is no escape except into accepting imprisonment and being locked up in silence, or into death and eternal life that is nothing else but death after all.

Macmurphy,  a former prisoner,  has been sent to a mental hospital for evaluation.  He has been charged with brutality and rape,  making the doctors believe there may be signs of mental illness.  What ensues is an incredible movie about one man's struggle to survive in a mental hospital and the effect he has upon the other patients.  Jack Nicholson won his first lead actor Oscar for his performance in Cuckoo's nest.  He is simply unbelievable.  He was very due for an oscar.  This was his 4th nomination.  Fellow nominee Walter Matthau,  upon hearing Nicholson's name announced,  was said to have leaned over to his wife and said ""It's about time.""  Louise Fletcher won an Oscar for best actress in her unforgettable turn as Nurse Ratched,  the stern facilitator of the mental ward.  There are many patients and people who would soon become big stars,  such as Danny Devito,  Christopher Lloyd,  Louis Gossett Jr., and an amazing performance by Sydney Lassick.  The real deal is Milos Forman,  the winner for best director,  and the man behind such films as Amadeus(His 2nd Oscar for Direction),  The People V. Larry Flynt,  and Man on the Moon.  He even used real mental ward patients to add realism to the film.  This film was produced by a young Michael Douglas,  earning him his first Oscar.

91010,5,0790732181,"It's difficult for one to speak of this film without gushing superlatives, but ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" has to be considered among the greatest ever American pictures. Not a hair is out of place in this fantastic adaptation of Ken Kesey's popular novel, and it's no accident that the movie won every major Academy Award for 1976. (Only two other films have swept the five major Oscars -- Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Screenplay -- ""It Happened One Night"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs."") If you like dramas that examine human frailties and peculiarities, this movie is a must see. It will involve you with laughter, anger, dismay, angst, and elation. No cinematic work is perfect, but ""Cuckoo's Nest"" comes pretty darned close.
Jack Nicholson is in his defining role as ""Jack McMurphy""; his persona is not only ideal for the part, but his acting is absolutely splendid. Nicholson is supported by a wonderful cast that includes the painfully unforgettable performance of Louise Fletcher as ""Nurse Ratched."" Several then unknown actors -- Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito among them -- round out the troupe beautifully. The redoubtable director Milos Forman guides his band of exceptional actors through an excellent screenplay and into cinematic immortality.
While this DVD's picture quality leaves much to be desired, it's somehow fitting for this film. Strangely, the documentary-like quality of the movie make the prevalent grain and foreign matter appear as though they belong! This is the only film I've yet seen that doesn't seem to lose much for want of a good print. Still, objectively speaking, Warner showed no respect to this classic by allowing such a poor copy on DVD -- and providing a mediocre transfer to boot. (No surprise, they did a TERRIBLE job with ""The Stanley Kubrick Collection""; so bad that they're redoing it.) Recorded sound is merely acceptable. The ""special features"" may once have been something, but they aren't any longer. DVD collectors expect more nowadays, not just a few pages of text.  In the end, however, this item remains a ""buy""; it's relatively cheap, and it's the only available DVD version of this great movie.",985305600,4,2195,5.046831955922865
91011,1,0790732181,"This is one of my favourite films starring Jack Nicholson. One generalised thing that gets me is that a lot of the people I know haven't seen it. Believe me, it's a classic.
Jack plays McMurphy, a new edition to a mental institute. This is due to a rape and five charges of assault. About ten minutes into the film, when McMurphy's talking to the doctor about why he's there, McMurphy says 'I think we ought to get to the bottom of RP McMurphy'. This certainly happens by the end of the film.
OFOACN (it's as difficult to abbreviate the title as it is to write it out) is plainly shot but smooth. The colouring is bleak and drab. It's like when you come out of a cinema, where you've just seen a special effects film, and you see the colour of real life.
It's a film about breaking the rules (like Brando's The Wild One) but it's also hilarious. It's difficult to concentrate on the meaning because the film is so enjoyable to watch. In my opinion, OFOACN is questioning sanity. How can you class people as insane when it's so difficult to describe sanity? Hell, just look around you.
Over the years, you can watch it again and again. Frankly if you're interested in film and don't see this you must be insane.",984960000,3,1210,4.3822222222222225

There are no interesting extras on this DVD.  No deleted scenes, no commentaries, no behind the scenes footage.  Just some text screens talking about awards the film received, etc.
The are no audio options.  You're just stuck with standard sterio.  And the menu is bland and static.  Basically, you are getting the movie, as you would have experienced it in a theater nearly three decades ago, and nothing else.

91028,5,0790732181,"This is my favorite movie of all time. Typically, movies that are adapted from great novels (and the novel is outstanding) aren't nearly as good as the novels themselves. Cuckoo's Nest is one of those very, very rare exceptions. In the novel, the story is told through the eyes of The Chief while in the film, the story is told through the eyes of McNulty (Nicholson). This is an excellent choice as the film would not have worked through the eyes of a mostly silent character.
The direction by Forman is brilliant and the screenplay and cinimatography are top knotch but the acting towers over everything. Everyone knows that the performances by Nicholson and Fletcher are amazing, and they certainly are, but the rest of the cast is excellent as well. The casting is simply flawless. The ensemble has future popular character actors DeVito and Lloyd among others who were unknowns at the time.
I've probably seen this film a dozen times and I still laugh in the beginning and am furious at the end.

91032,5,0790732181,"One of the truly great films. Its always difficult to compare one movie with another because they are often judged by a different measure in each case. So I won't bother comparing with anything.
This is the story of McMurphy a seeming career criminal full of cynicism and a boundless, reckless kind of energy for life and a disregard for authority. He enters the mental hospital because he is suspected of being psychologically disturbed and of course being the clever criminal he is chooses the ""loony bin"" rather than hard work on a prison farm. What strikes one immediately is the lack of sensitivity for others' feelings with regard to criminals, similarly we notice straight away the way nurse Pratchet controls her group of patients with an iron hand and a cold soul. The hospital corridors are empty and stark, the colours muted. The whole atmosphere is bleak. Milos Forman shows what he is capable of and gives a hint of his ability which he would later display in ""Amadeus"". Jack Nicholsen simply dominates the film in conjunction with nurse Pratchet. Nicholsen is the ideal choice but as noted by another reviewer he makes the role so completely his own that its difficult to see it any other way including his representation in the book.
As McMurphy shakes up the neat and tidy world constructed by the nurse he comes into more an more conflict with her especially after his ""outing"" with the other patients to the outside. One sees right away that these kinds of institutions, much like prisons, often don't help the recuperation of patients but rather make it more difficult for them to reorient themselves for the outside world. Hopefully these kinds of methods are now outdated and a more human perspective is applied.

91036,5,0790732181,"One day, Randall Patrick McMurphy (Nicholson) has a great idea. His prison sentence has a couple of months left to run and he gets himself assigned to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation. It means no more work detail in prison and he sees it as an amusing break.
In the hospital he runs up against his ward's boss, nurse Mildred Ratched (Fletcher). She appears nice but dominates, bullies and humiliates the men and sadistically crushes any initiative. When the doctors feel that McMurphy is swinging the lead and should be passed back to the prison service, Ratched views him as unfinished business and angles to keep him in the hospital.
For McMurphy, his holiday in the hospital seems to be going well. Despite occasional frustrations and disciplinary issues, he is enjoying himself and, from the viewer's perspective, he appears to be making a difference to the lives of some of the other patients. Nurse Ratched does not view this difference as a benefit.
Finally, McMurphy's ""holiday"" is interrupted when he learns that there is a big difference between the hospital and prison. He can on longer expect automatic release when his sentence is up. Far from it, he discovers that he faces a much longer stay than he expected.
Jack Nicholson is absolutely brilliant in this film. His portrayal of McMurphy is the best piece of acting that I have ever seen. The viewer is totally immersed in this character and it makes the hospital environment completely convincing. The rest of the cast do a fine job as assorted other patients. Playing a mentally ill character is never easy but they are convincing as they swing from being a collection of disturbed individuals to a bunch of guys under the influence of McMurphy.",974246400,,1719,4.870307167235495
91037,5,0790732181,"Jack Nicholson and his anti-hero character is at their best in this wonderful drama-comedy. Other actors (Louise Fletcher and Danny De Vito for  example) make good work too. I like the social message of the film; even  the wackos have the same needs than we all. They wanna make some love, get  drunk sometimes and have fun. Summa summarum, they are human-beings too.  Despite some tragig events at the end of the movie, it makes me feel  alive!  One of the best films I've ever seen.",967161600,,484,4.569767441860465
91038,3,0790732181,"UNfortinatly for the movie I had read the book first... the book being Amazing, one of the best works in american, or world lit.  I have ever had  the pleasure of reading. I am tempted to give the movie more stars, but  only cause Jack Nicholson did a 5 star perfomance, the only problem is the  directing was horribal. some of the charecters were a bit off base compared  to the book (which is ok) BUT, the book being as good as it was left the  door of potentiel wide open for a great flick, Nicholson showed that it  could of worked alot better. saying this is Nicholson's best perfomance is  beleivable, But he has played some pretty damn good other roles... over all  assesment, its worth the watch, and maybe a buy if the DVD went on sale  somewhere, but get the book, book is worth more reads then the movie with  watches..",967075200,2,830,4.324675324675325
91039,3,0790732181,"Cuckoo's Nest includes the role Jack Nicholson was born to play, of course, and the strength of his performance has earned it more plaudits than it probably deserves. The direction, too, is solid enough; as an  audience, we're immersed in the mental ward setting convincingly. There 's  also a handful of very nice supporting actors around Jack.
But I found  this movie almost unwatchable. The problem I have is that whoever adapted  the script from Ken Kesey's novel almost seems to have  ""lobotomized"" (forgive the obvious use of that) the moral  ambiguity of the thing. Nurse Ratched is the most radical case. In the book  she's far more complex, because we're given a window into her conscience.  That wouldn't have been impossible to do on film, but instead we're given a  Ratched here who -- as other reviewers have mentioned -- becomes a sort of  evil incarnate. Either you view her that way, or you end up wondering what  the heck is motivating her. In the absence of some reasonable explanation  for why she's doing what she is, Nicholson becomes the good guy and she's  the bad guy, and the movie loses the central questions asked in the  book.
Count me among those who think this is a decent, but overrated,  film. There seem to be a few of us.",964051200,6,1255,4.640909090909091
91040,5,0790732181,"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is one of the finest films I have ever  seen.  And I've seen a few.  What a shame, then, that this masterpiece is  presented so poorly on the much trumpeted 'superior' format.  More on that  later.  There isn't much to say about this film that you haven't heard  already.  Director Milos Forman paints a savage picture of 1970s America,  using the mental hospital setting as an allegory for a country that didn't  know its arse from its elbow.  There is much mirth to be enjoyed as Jack  Nicholson's McMurphy navigates his way around the two-faced, manipulative  institution, playing those in charge at their own game.  Forman skillfully  turns the tone on its head as McMurphy loses an unwinnable battle; his  pointless and tragic end is heartbreaking.  What strikes me most Cuckoo's  Nest is how such a powerful film could be so damn entertaining - and funny.  It's infuriating that Warner Bros put zero effort into giving this film  the DVD presentation it deserves.  The picture is no better than a good VHS  tape and the sound has to be turned right up to be listenable.  Unbelievably for an Oscar champion, there are no extra features of note.  This is a pathetic disc and Warner Bros should seriously consider  re-releasing it in an edition worthy of its greatness.  Five stars for the  film, one star for the disc.",959904000,,1354,4.695278969957082
91041,5,0790732181,This DVD is a good place to start any collection.  The movie is a great work of documenting a terific book.  It does not emulate the book exactly but conveys the atmosphere very well.  The cast is immpecable.  If Nurse  Ratchet's personality does not get under your skin you have no soul at all.  This is what makes a great movie.  Great characters and great acting.,959212800,,366,4.454545454545454
91042,5,0790732181,"The rating is for the film itself, not the DVD. The DVD is wanting especially in terms of picture quality. The letterbox format had a couple of scenes that seemed distorted, but they were short and the majority of  the film looked fine. There was a lot of scratches and floating hairs in  the beginning of the film but they became less noticeable as the film  progressed. This is a film that would benefit from a restoration with  extras such as commentary, deleted scenes and improved picture quality. The  production notes include very short actor biographies, and some notes on  the concept of the film, probably most of the information can be found with  a little Internet search. Overall, this DVD is not bad for a 25-year-old  film.",959126400,,738,4.7109375
91053,5,0790732181,"The transfer from print to film is neither a straightforward nor accurate process, and as such has left many casualties by the wayside: The Cider House Rules, Jurrassic Park, and so forth.  Typically poor adaptations are  either changed too much or too little: many are made to be suitable to too  wide an audience or have additions which clumsily contrast with the more  directly transferred parts, and many are so sloppily adapted that vestigial  scenes disrupt the movie's flow while not contributing anything that  connects to any other part of the much shortened movie.  One Flew Over the  Cuckoo's Nest is adapted nearly perfectly, making significant changes only  where necessary for the move to film, and adding ideas of its own which  beautifully match the rest of the movie.
Although it exhibits a few  vestigial scenes (such as nurse's suggestion that RPM (Jack Nicholson) is  ripping the other patients off), it has made many intelligent and  neccessary changes.  For example, it abandons chief as the narrator, and  therefore eliminates the possibility that his mental machinery is warping  the whole story (""But, Please.  It's still hard for me to have a clear  mind thinking on it.  But it's the truth even if it didn't happen.""),  opting instead for a more movie-friendly third person perspective, centered  on RPM.  Of course, some elements had to be completely cut (e.g. the  ""Black Boys"" are nearly nice people in the movie), but all  cutting was done with the necessary, elegant precision of trimming a  flower.
The acting on almost everybody's behalf is, at its worst, very  good, and at its best, brilliant.  The mental patients are enjoyably  extreme personalities played enjoyably accurately by such offbeats as Danny  DeVito.  Jack Nicholson seemed to just be playing a side of himself, but  his acting is still great to watch even if it probably wan't very  challenging for him.  But most of all, Louise Fletcher played Nurse Ratched  perfectly, making her both understandable and monstrous, while keeping her  character so realistic that you will find yourself analyzing her the way  you analyze real people instead of the way you analyze movie characters.  That is acting at its best.
Not a single frame in this movie is by any  means beautiful, including the beginning and ending which contain scenics.  These scenics were apparently shot with that relentlessly color-accurate  film that you could still find in the 70s, which made some otherwise  beautiful shots painfully murky, brownish, and otherwise realistic.  Most  of the rest of the movie was shot indoors, inside a painfully sterile  building with asylum-white walls and asylum-exposed-piping.  On more than  one occasion, I really started feeling and thinking like I was trapped in  that building, like the characters: when we saw some people from the  outside playing music by the fence, I was genuinely excited that something  was a little different today.  There is a painting by the front door near  the beginning of the movie which is so drab and obligatorially placed that  you can just see Nurse Ratched choosing and placing it in order to  miserably fail at lightening up the place.  Every frame of this movie  ball-cuttingly sterile.  It is expertly shot, but don't expect to want to  cry at its beauty like with other expertly-shot films, like The Shawshank  Redemption.
The mastering to DVD is nothing special in this production,  but hi-fi video and audio is so unnecessary to this film that it would  probably interfere with its overall feel.  Had those scenics at the  beginning and end been bright and crisp, their significance would have been  vastly changed.  Most of the audio is oppressively equalized so that you  can turn the volume high, but still not hear what some people are saying,  like you are sinking into insanity.  Do not expect pretty pictures or  amazing sound from this disk -- expect something numbingly, painfully  well-done.
Don't let the stupid box art that could just as easily be for  yet another mediocre 70s buddy comedy keep you from taking it off the  shelf.

91054,5,0790732181,"I watched ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" for the first time recently.  I'm still thinking about it nearly a week later.  I think it's one of the best movies I've ever seen - Nicholson is fabulous as McMurphy,  as is Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched.  It was never predictable, and you  feel as though you're really there in the clean, clean wards.  It's classed  as a ""drama"", and I suppose it is, but it has some really intense  psychological themes - it really affected me.  While I was watching it I  was enjoying myself, but it was just another movie.  Then I went to bed and  started thinking about it and realised just how amazing the story was  (credit to Ken Kesey, who wrote the novel of the same name).  When I  thought about it more, I became really enraged - only two movies have ever  had such a huge effect on my life.  I'm checking out my local library  catalogue at the moment - I need to read the novel!",957484800,,923,4.267441860465116

Probably the greatest thing of all in this  movie is the acting score. I mean, I'd really like to see Cristopher Lloyd,  Danny DeVito or Jack Nicholson himself in a better role than this is!  Of  course, everything is nearly perfect in this milestone masterpiece!",956880000,,521,4.586956521739131
91056,5,0790732181,"This movie is flawless.  Nobody should ever even attempt to make another film about a mental ward.  The performances are inspiring.  Nicholson does his best work and, let's face it, that alone says a lot for this film.  Everybody else does a wonderful job complimenting his zany character.  Louise Fletcher, a virtual unknown before the picture hit theaters, is  superb as the nurse who belittles her patients, allowing them no chance to  control their own lives.  This film is essentially about the war, both  psychologically and physically, that takes place between Nurse Ratchett and  troublemaking inmate Randal Patrick McMurphy.  As McMurphy begins to rule  the ward with reckless abandon, leading the mutiny of the other patients  against the oppressive forces within the hospital, the head nurse begins to  feel her power over them dwindling.  The disasters that come as a result of  this tension make for one of the best dramas ever put on screen.  One of  the most memorable scenes in film history takes place when McMurphy, upset  at the prospect of not being able to watch a World Series game on  television, begins announcing the game himself loud enough so that the  other members of the ward can hear him.  As he becomes more and more  excited about what's happening in his fictional game -- homeruns, runners  getting on base, etc. -- the other patients rally around him and begin to  celebrate his every word.  This scene is just one of many captivating  moments that take place in this film.  Every person past the age of 16  should watch this unbelievable piece of movie-making.",956620800,,1596,4.894736842105263
91057,4,0790732181,This is a movie about Ratched for taking the hospital while McMurphy wants to help the patient. Why do Flecther as Ratched is the best actress in 1975. Ratched just argue and have meeting. Only Jack Nicholson should have  a award.,954633600,,230,4.609756097560975
91058,4,0790732181,"Milos Forman's One Flew over The Cuckoo's nest is a wonderful film to watch at night on cable alone and then rave about it to friends and family next morning. The barrage of acclaim and Forman's direction do the movie a  great dis-service becuase they make out the film to be something much more  than it is. This should have been a much simpler movie, one about a convict  in mental institution, not A MESSIAH FREEING SOULS FROM THE TYRANNY OF  ESTABLISHMENT. We should have seen what the bathrooms look like in the  hospital, what kind of food they eat, the human struggle against maddness.  Instead we get R.P. McMurphy taking the patients on fishing trips, playing  unplayable basketball games all supposedly representing the unbreakable  will of the human heart. All this ofcourse is very entertaining, but its  also stretching to make a point rather then let events unfold, and let the  viewer develop a profound response from which he/she can reach these  conclusions. Take for example The Shawshank Redemption(a superior film),  that film is patient with its evnts, it doesn't push its messages and as a  result it is much more moving. I don't mean to suggest that Cuckoo's Nest  is in anyway a bad film, I have merely gone out of my way to point out that  it would have been that much better on a smaller simpler scale. The  cinematogrohpy in the opening and closing sequences is outstanding as is  the musical score and ofcourse the acting.

It's hard to tell if Nicholson is acting or just being Jack.  Add to that exceptional  perfomances by Louise Fletcher and others and it's a perfect formula for  outstanding cinema.  The film displays the cruel treatment of mental  illness in old institutions as R.P. McMurphy (Nicholson) is committed for  evaluation.  Being more of a hell raiser than a mental patient, others in  the ward find his behavior magnetic and almost theraputic.
