2015910,3,B0001MMF4G,"I've only seen this movie through MST3K when it was SWAMP DIAMONDS and it was a very funny episode when they did it,which you can get on Volume 10. Mike Conners is in this,but was credited as Touch Conners. There's lots of padding in this movie and it seems like there wasn't much editing at all. Plus,another mistake is when Touch's girl makes a run for it in the canoe and she falls over,she's actually in a swimming pool instead of in a swamp...Sill enjoyable nonetheless..",1171152000,,476,4.546511627906977
2015911,2,B0001MMF4G,"""Swamp Women"" is generally regarded as one of the worst films by B-movie auteut Roger Corman (it was on ""Mystery Science Theater"" as well as in the Medveds' old book ""50 Worst Films of All Time""). It's the story of four tough-talkin' prison girls who go to a swamp to find some hidden diamonds. Along the way they kidnap a strapping young man and his cowardly wife, who abruptly dies early on. This isn't one of Corman's more entertaining cheapies, although it has its moments. The alligator wrestling scene is a high point in the history of bad movies, and the hilariously macho prison girls (including regular Corman leading lady Beverly Garland) inspire a few giggles.
The DVD from Brentwood is, unsurprisingly for a bargain-bin disc, unexceptional. The colour image is murky and faded, while the sound often seems muffled. That being said, I doubt there are any pristine versions of ""Swamp Women"" to use as a master. There are no extras.",1113264000,5,941,4.814814814814815
2015912,3,B0001MMF4G,"This movie was made around 1955 so the above ""1941"" listed year is 14 years too early.  I haven't seen this DVD version but I have seen the film.  Swamp Woman was not intended to be taken seriously! It is a mans' fantasy film about beautiful women convicts holding a handsome guy and his girl-friend hostage in the swamp! heee! A sort of guilty pleasure.  My enjoyment of this film is watching Beverly Garland, who is always wonderful to look at!",1094947200,6,446,4.481481481481482
2015913,3,B0001MMF4G,"I'm not a big fan of Roger Corman's cheaper-looking monsters (as in ""the creature from haunted sea"" et al), however, SWAMP WOMEN could certainly have used one of Corman's 8' styrofoam space-turds to spice things up a bit! Instead, we've got four women, consisting of 3 ""hardened"" criminals and one undercover cop, floating through the bayou. We've also got Mike Conners and his half-wit girlfriend as hostages. It seems the ""Nardo Girls"" have escaped from prison in search of $200,000.00 in stolen diamonds. Unbeknownst to them, a policewoman is posing as their partner in crime. We get to see Conners tied to several trees, and his dopey girlfriend gets (thank you God) eaten by alligators. Eventually, the diamonds are found, the girls have one catfight after another (the only real highlight), and one decides to sneak off with both the diamonds and Mike Conners! This leads to her demise at the end of a spear. Beverly Garland isn't bad, but everyone else had me wishing for more gator attacks!. This film is 70 minutes long and would have been much better at 50 or so. Watch it if there's nothing else to do...",1081728000,6,1115,4.782383419689119

8014728,2,B0001MMF4G,"By looking at the cover of this Brentwood DVD version, you'd think it was a horror film.  It turns out to be just female cons in the Louisiana swamps.  The print has numerous color issues, is in full screen, the beginning credits are practically cut-off and there is some bad splicing during dialogue.  I don't expect anything better from the other editions and haven't been able to find any info on this longer version mentioned on IMDB and another review.",1452297600,,457,4.6875

8014731,3,B0001MMF4G,"Bad, bad ...irredeemably BAD by any criteria, ""Swamp Women"" will either have you howling with laughter, or dozing off and wondering how many times you can see the same patch of swamp cyprus draped with moss.

Four Gals, ...three hardened tough-talkin' crims and one undercover cop are let break out of the hoosegow and head for the bayous in search of some long buried diamonds, ..tracked by the compliant police of course. On the way the girl-gang kidnap a hunky bloke and his supremely irritating over-gushing simpering girlfriend. (Even he doesn't seem all that upset when she meets a very predictable end, ..while I was actually cheering for the 'gator!)

Just about every clich is covered here. That creepy Old Man's Beard moss hanging from everything? Check!
Mardi Gras parade? Check! Loud and interminable score with little or no relation to the action? Check!
Scantily clad women? Check!
They even hack off their long jeans into ""Daisy-Dukes"" about halfway through the movie to expose even more flesh. Never mind that the Louisiana bayous are known to be full of mosquitos, leeches and cotton mouth snakes eager to attack any exposed flesh,these gals are gonna flash skin!

Now this movie actually caters to a particular male fantasy of being held captive and thus being in a state of complete vulnerability to several female sexual predator's every whim. And in this fetish-fantasy, it's never mind any alligators! These girls are voracious!

The gals keep the captive bloke's hands permanently tied behind his back, ....which raises the thought in the back of one's mind of just how he managed any ....er, ""toiletary"" necessities during the four of five days or so they all spend travelling and camping out in the swamp?
Perhaps the girls lent a hand and helped him ""go"", but alas, we aren't privy to any such salacious assistances to the very necessary male excretory needs.

Every now and then one or other of the crim-gals edges up to the poor recumbent bloke for a bit of a smooch and a free-feel.
One even starts to unbutton the helpless man's shirt and seems very eager to head even further south in her randy manual explorations but is timely interrupted by the sudden appearance of one of the other escapees.
Phew, ...for a minute there I thought this was going to be a case of a very ""blue"" bayou indeed....

The sexual titillation factor is raised even higher by several girl-on-girl fight/wrestling scenes, with some pretty appalling stage-punches, all dubbed with bone-crunching foley effects of course. You can see the punches are all pulled or miss by miles but there's lots of girl-on-girl action scrambling around, variously in the dust, water or mud!

Yes they eventually find the diamonds, ....although how they managed to instantly find the unmarked location out in the swamp after four years or so of rampant plant growth is something of a mystery.

There are some incredibly ""clunky"" scenes, such as when the afore mentioned painfully irritating girlfriend tries to make a break for it and falls out of the boat. Instead of being in the murky swamp water, she's suddenly seen to be floundering about in a pristinely clean, fully tiled undoubtedly hygenically chlorinated swimming pool!
However the ubiquitous rubber alligator arrives on cue and finds her nevertheless, causing her dispatch ...MUCH to the audience's relief!
No one appears all that concerned about her demise, and neither will you!

This highly gratuitous offering is made FAR too long with endlessly repetitious shots of travelling up the bayou by boat before its VERY predictable ending where....yes, you've guessed it. The undercover cop-gal suddenly falls in love with the hunk and they kiss under the swaying moss as the cavalry arrives....by boat this time.

The print is just this side of appalling. Obviously just a copy of an old VHS. It was in colour ...at least I think so but you'll have a similar difficulty deciding like I did. The sound varies from quiet to very loud, but for some reason this doesn't seem to effect that damned music which plays on and on throughout the entire duration without a single break. It's ALWAYS full on LOUD!

Look, this is a strictly-for-laughs piece now, and your enjoyment(or not) will very much depend on whether you find ""bad"" movies to be fun in a weird sort of way or totally incompetent on all levels.
I enjoyed it up to a point, but it's far TOO long and too bad in parts to hold interest for the whole journey.

Still, if your sexual fantasy is to be held helplessly captive as scantily clad women have their way with your all too responsive body, hiring this movie will prove far cheaper than forking out for the full treatment at your local Madame Dominatrix's Dungeon...",1401235200,,4724,4.876558603491272
8014732,5,B0001MMF4G,"I don't see how you could ask for a worse film than this one. I found every moment of it delightful. It's sometimes difficult to remember (at my advanced age of 72) that adolescent boys once dreamed of being taken captive and chained up at gunpoint by the likes of Beverly Garland and Marie Windsor. Ah, Roger Corman! A true auteur -- but it's really his earliest exploitation turkeys that are the best. Hope this is released in Blu-ray sometime. BTW, I watched the Instant Video streaming version and have no idea what the actual DVD is like. If you dislike ""Swamp Women,"" you do not have genuinely bad taste and should give up cinema slumming altogether.",1374710400,2,656,4.615384615384615
8014733,1,B0001MMF4G,"This is a product review of the DVD ""Swamp Women"" released by Alpha.

What is bad -
  Aspect ratio - 1.33:1 (original 1.85:1)
  Audio - Below average
  Picture - Terrible colours and blurred like an old VHS. Actually, the tracking line present at the bottom of the screen pretty well proves this was ripped from a VHS tape and a poor copy at that!
  Subtitles - What subtitles?
  Movie version - You get the rated 68 minute version instead of the unrated 84 minute version.

What is good -
  I'm thinking..... I guess it does have a menu so you can browse Alpha's catalogue for other non-subtitled and poor transfer releases by Alpha.

I hold a pretty poor regard for Alpha releases but this one has plumbed new depths of shoddiness.

I give it 0 stars (although technically it is 1 as Amazon will not allow 0 - Pity.)",1371600000,4,818,4.389261744966443
8014734,5,B0001MMF4G,"A film which is in desperate need of a pristine digital remastering , Director Roger Corman's 'SWAMP WOMEN'-1955 may be the precursor to the tough babe women in prison genre which dominated the exploitation cycle of the late sixties and early seventies especially the European market. Produced by the brothers Woolner who made and distributed their share of genre titles and made before Corman's Horror/Sci-Fi output and his main photographer Floyd Crosby in harness, the film shows Corman forming his brilliant low budget style with excellent ensemble acting perfs and wicked camera set ups by Fred West which pumps up eroticism and sexual heat more than the Louisiana bayou could provide. Beverly Garland incinerates the screen along with Marie Windsor as prison escapees who kidnap Mike Connors billed here as Touch Connors and his girlfriend into searching for hidden diamonds.  Naturally the usual bickering over Connors and the intense environment get the better of everyone. The dialogue by screenwriter David Stern is priceless, one great line has Connors being interrupted from sleeping tied to a tree as Carole Matthews creeps up to him and tries to give him a smooch he says, ""Whats this, dessert?""  There's alligator wrestling, hair pulling (the girl on girl fight has to be seen to be believed )and a rousing music score by Willis Holman which keeps everything flowing within its 68 minute running time but its Beverly Garland who one remembers as she spits and struts her stuff making 'SWAMP WOMEN' a fifties male wet dream come to life. Alpha Video has the best quality of the film that I have seen which is not saying much but the colors are bright rather than washed out and there are no scratches or splices on the negative to be found which they deserve kudos for.  This is low budget filmmaking at its best and out shadows all the made to video modern day DVD dreck which is cluttering up players lately. One of my favorite Corman films, it comes highly recommended.",1324339200,7,1986,4.904761904761905
8014735,3,B0001MMF4G,"Mid-50s thriller, before TV sucked up the market for cheap film noirs.  OK, the acting in this isn't great and you can't quite believe the acting, but it is a nice ride  A smart and dedicated police woman (as if New Orleans could have a clean police force!) is planted as an undercover in a prison.  She's gonna find a stash of diamonds, and she does.  Mike Connors is taken as a hostage - the chicks want some entertainment, after several years in prison, what the heck, huh! - and after some grisly murders and lots of hair-pulling, you would never guess what happens.

We shouldn't fault this, it's a product of its time and it ain't bad.  The chicks even have a lot more character than Connors and definitely look better.

Recommended for the junk that it is, 50s style.",1300406400,3,774,4.446808510638298
8014736,2,B0001MMF4G,"A group of three women have hidden diamonds somewhere.  The women were captured and sent to prison, but they have yet to confess the location of the diamonds.  Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on whether you are an audience member for this movie), the police have a clever plot to locate the diamonds.  A female police officer (Carole Mathews) is going to prison to infiltrate the gang.  She will help the three women escape and let them lead her to the location of the hidden diamonds.  My only question is:  Why didn't I think of that?

While we see the setup for the great jail break, we also get to see Bob Matthews (played by Touch, later Mike, Conners, star of ""Mannix""; Conners has appeared in hundreds of movies and television episodes, including ""Island in the Sky"" with John Wayne) and his girl friend wandering about, apparently at Mardi Gras in New Orleans.  Eventually they end up boating in the same swamp as...

The prison break ladies have made their getaway.  Unfortunately, they require new transportation.  Just about that time Bob and his girl friend show up in a boat.  What a coincidence!  At first, the three tough-as-hangnails prison babes want to kill Bob and his girl friend, but the undercover police woman convinces the women that the pair would be better as hostages versus alligator snacks.

The police plan works, except now Bob and his girl friend are tagging along.  Things get pretty boring from this point forward, so director Roger Corman livens things up by having the ladies get into fights.  The fights look over-exaggerated, but they sure are fun!  We also get to see macho man Connors tied to a tree while a hot prison babe cozies up to him.  See, the excitement knows no bounds!

Roger Corman is generally better when he has a rubber monster floating about somewhere.  We only get a poor defenseless alligator in this movie.  Against three prison babes, a police woman and Mike Connors, I felt sorrier for the alligator than I did for his intended prey.  The alligator would have just got indigestion anyway (kind of like the audience).

In order to want this film you have to be a really, REALLY big fan of Roger Corman or one of the people appearing in this movie.  If you are not a really big fan, why bother?  This movie has a weak plot and the acting is frequently over-the-top.  When the acting is not hammy, it is corny.  The movie is so slow in places that I had a hard time staying awake.

There are a few movies where you wonder why you spent the time to watch it.  This movie definitely falls into that category.  Unless you are trying to fill out your collection of Roger Corman or Mike Connors movies, try ""Attack of the Giant Leeches"" or ""Humanoids from the Deep.""

Good luck - you'll need it!",1187740800,4,2757,4.59958932238193
