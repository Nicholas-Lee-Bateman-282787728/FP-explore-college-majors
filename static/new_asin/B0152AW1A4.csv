7425782,4,B0152AW1A4,"'Twas the week before Christmas and, with the promise of a promotion being dangled, tabloid reporter Greta Kaine (Katrina Law) is deployed to Big Bear, Cali to dig up juicy gossip on the Tannenhills, the West Coast's most prominent political family. A side note is that Greta had promised to pick up her soon-to-be-hitched friend's hideous wedding dress. When her car dies in a snow storm en route to Big Bear, Greta Kaine, garbed as if she were headed for a summer picnic, ends up squirming into the wedding dress for added warmth. And when she collapses in front of Benjamin Tannenhill's (Jordan Belfi) cabin, he assumes that she's a runaway bride what got caught out in the snow. There you have it, now the movie title makes sense.

Greta Kaine knows an in when she sees one, and she doesn't correct Ben. And when asked for her name, she does start with the truth but then fumbles it. So now Ben thinks her name is ""Greta Cainandabelsteinsky."" Heh.

I've seen SNOW BRIDE three times now, and it's made me smile each time. Then again, it's rare that Hallmark disappoints with its Christmas movie roll-outs, especially when viewed during the holiday season. The plot wends down a well-beaten path, and the dramatic conflicts are all familiar stuff. Ultimately, the bone of contention revolves around Greta's having to make up her mind. Having wormed into the Tannenhill family's good graces, having even agreed impulsively to pose as Ben's girlfriend when his ex unexpectedly shows up, can she betray their trust for the sake of a good scoop? But maybe it's all moot, anyway, since her reporter rival (Tom Lenk) had been doing his own snooping around.

It's a must that you don't get exasperated that Greta doesn't simply fess up about who she is. But then it'd be a much shorter movie, right? So what we get are these vexing moments when Greta would turn to Ben and blurt out sentences like ""I have to tell you something - something important."" And then they'd get distracted. Never mind. SNOW BRIDE is a fun holiday romantic comedy that Katrina Law anchors with confidence and with an unexpected knack for comedy. I say ""unexpected"" because I'm just so used now to watching her be all grim and broody as Nyssa al Ghul on ARROW. This is Katrina with a light touch and a sunny smile and a charmingly goofy way about her. She's adorable and warm when she's not being a tortured assassin.",1446422400,15,2387,4.678571428571429

7425900,4,B0152AW1A4,"This Christmas romance is about a gossipmonger (Katrina Law as Greta Kaine), who makes her living off of disparaging stories she writes about the rich and famous.  She has no scruples, she doesnt care if the stories are real or not.  These people don't deserve our sympathy.  Her editor wants the dirt on a famous political family and encourages a competition between her and another sleaze merchant.  Whoever gets the best dirt first gets to be the editor of the tabloids online magazine.  Happily, Greta not only gets her foot in the door, shes housed with the family in question, just waiting for an expos to fall into her lap, no work required.  Unfortunately, she is not the only sneak in the house.  An ex-girlfriend has shown up, switching from one brother to the other, intent on becoming a member of this family, or else!

As presented, every character in this movie lies out of convenience.  To soften what might be problematic, theyve tried to present this as a screwball comedy.  In which case, it works great if you don't consider the fact that no one in this movie is virtuous.",1513641600,,1091,4.664921465968586

7425907,5,B0152AW1A4,"I watched ""Snow Bride"" on TV since Hallmark has a slew of Christmas movies during this time of the year.  I liked it so much that I had to order the DVD so I could watch it any time.
  The cast of characters added to my enjoyment because of their acting and chemistry.  Patricia Richardson stood out with her acting; the lead actors and supporting cast were a delight.  I'm amazed that Hallmark does not have more movies featuring the lead actors since the chemistry between the two was great.
  All in all, ""Snow Bride"" is a movie to see and enjoy again and again.",1511136000,,565,4.3238095238095235
7425908,4,B0152AW1A4,"I'm a fan of Patricia Richardson and I thought she made the story seem more plausible.  I didn't give the movie 5 stars because the love story feels a bit contrived at first and the ending isn't as strong as other Hallmark movies, but once it gets moving and Patricia's character enters the story, there are heart felt and touching scenes that are captivating.  I watched this on YouTube and liked it enough to buy a copy.",1510358400,,422,4.467532467532467

It warms my heart every time I watch it.  I like how the relationship between the main characters starts out as a fake but as the movie progresses, they find out they have feelings for each other.  Of course Greta had originally wanted a story about Ben and his family for a gossip rag she worked for but couldn't write it after getting to know them.  Ben's ex-girlfriend comes into the picture and stirs the pot a little making for an interesting plot.

7426604,5,B0152AW1A4,"I watched this movie on TV last year.  I enjoyed it so much that I bought it, so I could watch it whenever I wanted to.  My review (I like to keep it simple):  rich (tabloid phobic) man meets woman (a tabloid reporter) when he rescues her from hypothermia when her car is stuck in the snow and she has only her workout outfit and her best friends wedding dress to wear to keep her warm.  Of course her cell phone will not work in such an isolated area.  So as she stumbles around in the snow storm looking for help, she literally falls down an embankment and lands in his vicinity.  From there, the story continues to be so implausible and yet so delightful.  It's just one of those feel good movies that ends well.  If you want something deeper, WAR AND PEACE  is suppose to be coming out soon.  ENJOY!",1449792000,16,803,4.223684210526316
