3645449,5,B001HY3BV8,Great movie for anyone who has experience prejudice.  It tells about the early LDS Church but it is more about people who have the courage to stand up for what they believe under extreme conditions and about the struggles in exploring faith.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a quality movie and enjoys seeing someone overcome difficulties.,1406764800,2,350,4.915254237288136
3645450,5,B001HY3BV8,"I read the 9 volumes of the Work and Glory books. These movies are fantastic.
The book has a lot more to offer but seeing it is much more fun. It is a very
intense movie. I had to watch one after the other one day. I just had to know
what was next. You don't have to be a Mormon to watch this movie. It is fascinating
to watch. This book is for the entire family.",1401753600,4,363,3.727272727272727

8310006,5,B001HY3BV8,"This is a very well done movie, so very close to the book.  We enjoyed it so much that this purchase was a gift. Though the main characters are fictional, the depiction of Joseph Smith and those who were so instrumental in the early days of the Mormon Church is portrayed historically correct. If you are interested in the history of these people their trials and triumphs this a very entertaining way to learn.",1424563200,2,411,4.554054054054054
