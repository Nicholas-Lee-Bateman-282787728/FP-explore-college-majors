Nearly every great memory of the sixties I have, The Beatles were there too! On the radio, record player, jukebox, somewhere in the background you could hear The Fab Four singing & playing!
This isn't the best video of those days I've seen, but the good thing is, this one has The Beatles in it!",1334707200,,350,4.161764705882353
8412477,1,B000HT386C,"Very disappointing after seeing and reading the box cover. Absolutely horrid transfer, unwatchable, faces are blurry! Cheap VHS to DVD transfer. Beatle fans, stay away from this one!",1270857600,8,182,5.535714285714286
8412478,3,B000HT386C,Sorta poor quality but I knew that. Good enough to have for any Beatles fan.,1256256000,,76,4.133333333333334
8412479,1,B000HT386C,"The description looked good, the price was fair, the cover was nice, but this documentary is a stinker! Here's some info that should help make up your mind if you're still thinking about forking out the $$$ for this garbage: There is no narration; There is absolutely no continuety; Most of the footage apears to be 4th generation video (very grainy); Some of the footage is incomplete; The editing is terrible (a caveman could have done better!); And, finally, The DVD ends abruptly - no closing credits, no ""the end"", nothing! Maybe the people who made this realized that they put together a piece of junk and didn't want to put their name on it.
Bottom line - stay away!",1187049600,43,673,4.616666666666666
