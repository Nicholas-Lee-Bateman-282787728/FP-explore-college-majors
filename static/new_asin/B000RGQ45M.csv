8200539,5,B000RGQ45M,Hard to beieve that 30 minutes once a week is already making a difference after just six sessions.  I believe I will enjoy wearing a swimsuit this summer!!,1391817600,5,155,4.535714285714286
8200540,2,B000RGQ45M,"I've read his book and thought the tapes were going to give me a better overall of the techniques.  They tapes also kept referring to the full program booklet, and I never received that.  So I was not happy with the product and sent it back.  The seller was prompt and I would say they are alright.",1358121600,2,298,4.192982456140351
8200541,3,B000RGQ45M,"This home version of the book is okay for those needing an actual video demonstation.
But it is no substitute. Please read ""Slow Burn Fitness Revolution"" first.",1328918400,6,160,4.962962962962963
8200542,5,B000RGQ45M,"I am very pleased with this company and its product. I have done the exercises only once but found them very manageable and the instructions very clear.
I hadn't received the DVDs a month after placing the order. When I contacted Serious Strength they responded within a day to let me know there had been a delay because of paperwork at customs - paperwork which had never been required before that point. Sure enough, the package arrived three days later.
I'm excited to see if this exercise program gives the results it promises. I am skeptical, but I was also skeptical about the results of eating low carb like the Drs. Eades recommend, and that worked very well. Since they are associated with Fred Hahn's Slow Burn workout, I gotta believe that the workout is just as good.",1302393600,14,779,4.6521739130434785
8200543,5,B000RGQ45M,"If you want to see a video presentation of the slow burn method, these DVDs are great. They are professionally produced, so there are no amateurish annoyances you sometimes see on exercise videos. Seeing the video may be very helpful to those of us who cannot afford to pay hundreds of dollars for a personal consultation with a slow burn instructor, but still want to see the exercises in full motion.

Disc 1. The Essentials
Everything you need to know to get started.

The first DVD explains the theory behind the slow burn technique, without too much scientific detail. It has something from each of the three authors of the original book: Fred Hahn, Dr. Michaek Eades, and Dr. mary Dan Eades. It also has testimonials from clients.

If you are already receptive to the technique, the video explains everything quickly and then gets you started. If you need to be convinced, or want to hear more about the science, then you should definitely read the book for details.

Disc 2. Strong in Six
Fred Hahn's revolutionary firness program designed to get you strong, lean and healthy in 6 weeks or less!

The second DVD contains the main workout. These workout videos are the main course of this meal!! Everything you need to do to perform the workout in the comfort and privacy of you own home.

It is important to note here that even though it is a workout video, it is not one you would watch while working out. It is more instructional to help you learn the proper technique. You have to do the exercises yourself, and pay attention to your own muscles. You can't just follow along with the video.

Disc 3. Strong for Life
Modify Slow Burn to meet you changing needs.

The third DVD goes through each exercise in the workout again, and shows you how to make it easier or harder to match your own fitness level.

I really liked the third DVD because I am a beginner, and I need an easier version to get started. It also shows you how to make each exercise hard enough for almost anybody to get a great workout!",1269216000,57,2012,4.520661157024794
