8511778,4,B005GDTNZO,"I expected a movie that I could see with polarized glasses on a 3D widescreen television. Instead, I got a movie that requires colored (blue-red) glasses (4 pairs of glasses are included with the DVD). However, I was amazed at how many colors could be seen even with the colored glasses.

The movie is somewhat dark because of the glasses, but that only adds to the ambiance of the movie.

I've seen this movie twice in two days.

A 2D version of this movie was not included in the package.",1357257600,,490,4.4222222222222225
