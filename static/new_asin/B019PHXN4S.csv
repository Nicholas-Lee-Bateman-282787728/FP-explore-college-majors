8745677,5,B019PHXN4S,"This DVD is single handedly saving my shoulder and also banishing my neck pain I've had for years.  100% recommend to anyone, but especially to people involved in high intensity shoulder workouts/hobbies/lifestyles.  Life changing stuff here.",1530230400,,242,5.694444444444445
8745678,4,B019PHXN4S,"This DVD has been on my Wish List forever, and I finally got the opportunity to try it from a generous friend. I have chronic issues in my dominant right shoulder, most likely having to do with computer/mouse use, amongst other things. I have tried various stretching programs, but to be honest, it's been hard to stick with anything consistently, and nothing seems to provide anything more than temporary relief.

I was already familiar with instructor Kristina Nekyia from her online videos, where she offers a brief Shoulder Supplemental routine that I've always found useful. On this DVD, Nekyia provides introductions to each of three segments: Part 1, Stabilization/Warm-Up (19 minutes), Part 2, Strengthening (17 minutes), and Part 3, Mobility (10 minutes). During the exercises themselves, Nekyia is not on-camera; rather, she instructs via voiceover while three different athletes model the workouts. Nekyia, both a fitness coach and contortionist, offers precise, detailed instruction interwoven with quite a bit of humor.

The Main Menu breaks down the DVD into individual chapters rather than the three parts. Here is the entire listing:

Tubing with handing is used for all three segments, and for main of the exercises, you will need to be able to anchor your tubing in a doorway/other heavy object. The first time I tried the workout, I did only the Warm-Up. All of these exercises use the anchored tubing, and they generally felt good on my shoulder. On the second day, I did Parts 2 and 3. The Strengthening work was much tougher than I had anticipated. It starts off stepping on the band and doing some more traditional-like strength moves, but eventually, you move onto the floor for a series of upper back work (some with the band) and finally plank work. The latter was tough on my shoulder, which felt sore after. The final segment returned to both anchored and two-handed band work, including pulsing movements, which Nekyia explains in the introduction to this section. Again, this work felt good on my shoulder.

I think that right now, when I am in more of a rehab stage, I need to stick to Parts 1 and 3 of this DVD only, which gives me a nice 30-minute routine.  It would be ideal to do this every other day, but I admit that it is difficult for me to fit it in that regularly.  This is in part due to the band work--although I like using the bands, it is difficult for me to anchor my band to a door AND see my screen at the same time, and some sometimes, I don't want to go to that hassle.  Still, this is definitely a worthwhile DVD, and I hope that more regular use will lead to more improvement in my shoulder.",1511222400,6,3142,4.9714285714285715
8745679,5,B019PHXN4S,I have very week shoulders so I had to do something to improve them. This video class is good for every level of fitness you may be at and you will gain strength. I highly recommend this for those of you who have issues or even if you just want to improve your flexibility and strength.,1468281600,2,286,4.125
8745680,5,B019PHXN4S,"I started pole dancing recently and discovered that the back of my shoulders is really weak, even though I am strong overall. My strength was build in the gym, so I guess that the smaller, stabilization muscles in my shoulders were neglected. I have the other Fit and Bendy DVDs and I love them, so I decided give this one a try. Glad a did. The program tackles both the stabilization and strength, just what I wanted. The third section is about range of motion, this is the section I like the least... It's not bad at all, but I expected more stretches, I don't feel that this section stretches my shoulders very well. I may be doing something or maybe range of motion is not the same as stretching... Anyway, I do recommend this DVD for anybody, because it will help correct your posture, most of us are hunching all day, strong back muscles will help straighten. A must if you are aerialist or pole dancer.",1467590400,7,909,4.449101796407185
8745681,5,B019PHXN4S,"another amazing dvd from Fit and Bendy!
