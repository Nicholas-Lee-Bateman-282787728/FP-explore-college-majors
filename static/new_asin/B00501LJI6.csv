4511224,4,B00501LJI6,"Probe was a tv pilot movie which eventually turn into Search (due to some rights issues) weekly series. The show was certainly ahead of its time in using the ""probe"" eye which can detect light spectrum,electro-magnetic waves,analyzed human respiration. Most of the episodes are smart & entertaining too bad it only lasted 1 season. I took away 1 star because Warner Bros did a sloppy job of transcribing to dvd even though it is a vod the movie looks good in some spots but especially in the beginning all the colors are washed away. I watch other WB archive discs like El Condor & Yes, Giorgio both films look sharp & pristine and both are vods. Don't know why Probe look so poorly and as far as I know Probe was never release in vhs format in North America, if WB use a superior vhs to transcribe it it should look half way decent.",1322179200,4,833,4.415584415584416
4511225,2,B00501LJI6,The story line is technology based and is more hardware than software.  Shows its age.  Everything is angular without momentum.  Probably would be a good MysteryScience 2000 movie.  10 years before PCs.,1315440000,,202,5.21875
4511226,5,B00501LJI6,"This show was a league on its own in the '70s. I would say that of all the sci-fi/action TV shows I watched as a child, this one made the deepest impression. Few (if any) other shows visualized technologies in the near future as accurate as 'Probe' (or 'Search') did. The theme music together with the opening sequence was an absolute masterpiece. Amazing how after nearly forty years the show still give me the thrills. I hope they keep up the good efforts and release the entire series on DVD. Fans like me will finally be happy.",1314576000,12,531,4.484536082474227
4511227,5,B00501LJI6,"In many respects, I have had a vested interest in seeing the release of the pilot episode, `PROBE', from Warner Brothers as part of the only chat group I belong to petitioned Warner Brothers to getting it released. That happened six weeks ago but off Warner Brothers direct, it can only be sold in the States. I had to wait a bit longer for it to be circulated to American Amazon and then to see it rapidly sell out. Fortunately, some of the subsidiary companies still have copies and I finally got my copy. Ensure you own a multi-regional DVD player if you want to watch this film outside of the USA. When you compare the sales of `PROBE' to others from Warner's Archive Collection limited release, this looks healthy and is getting us revved up for them to consider releasing the twenty-two episode season of `Search'. If you're fans of other pilots or shows Warner's haven't released yet and belong to any groups supporting such programmes, a multi-petition does get results.
  So what makes `PROBE' and `Search' itself Science Fiction? I mean, today we're familiar with using miniaturised spy-tech and use it ourselves. One only has to look at mobile phone camera lens and see that they are as small as the miniature TV scanners the PROBE agents carry on their person. They can't do as much. Well, not yet and without a battery - energy is pumped in after all, although that might not be far off these days. These TV scanners can see across the wide spectrum from infra-red to sniper scope and other sensors monitor medical telemetry and such. Through this and an implanted earjack and tooth bleeper, the PROBE agent keeps in contact with the team back at their headquarters and be supplied information and such as he goes about his task. You've seen the likes of this being used in `The X-Files' - which paid a homage to this series - and `Alias'. However, `PROBE' and `Search' was originally done in 1972 where such things would have seemed far-fetched. Indeed, I lent a mate a copy of the pilot I'd taped off TV back in the 80s and showed him in the 90s, who thought no camera could be so small. Reality is catching up with fiction but `PROBE' got there first.
  Back in the 70s, there were all kinds of detective programmes coming out, so having a high-tech one shouldn't have been much of a surprise. `PROBE' was written and produced by TV veteran Leslie Stevens (who co-produced `The Outer Limits') and directed by Russ Mayberry, who would also direct the 90 minute versions of `The Six Million Dollar Man' a couple years later and other pilots. It also has one of most memorable uplifting TV theme music tracks by Dominic Frontiere (who amongst his other credits, includes the music to `The Invaders') with its full version here. Mentioning all these people is point out its rare pedigree. PROBE, by the way, is an acronym standing for Programmed Retrieval Operations. The `BE' is top secret but I've always bet on `By Electronics' myself.
  Hugh Lockwood (actor Hugh O'Brian) is PROBE One, working for the World Securities Corporation who track down anything missing for a price. After the successful rescue of a diplomat, Lockwood is coerced out of some r'n'r, to go on the hunt for the Entourage Collection jewels lost at the end of World War Two, assisted by jewel expert Harold Streeter (actor John Gielgud) on a trip to Austria following its only clue to an old lady, Frida Ullman (actress Lilia Skala) and her adult daughter, Heidi (actress Elke Sommer). When they are attacked and her mother goes missing, they follow the clues back to the USA and a hotel hiding Nazi treasure. There's far more that in this ninety-five minute story but that would be considered spoiler.
  What sets this story apart is the witty banter that Lockwood hears from the people listening and watching from PROBE Control, led by VCR Cameron (actor Burgess Meredith) and the sardonic medical officer Gloria Harding (actress Angel Tompkins) that nearly forty years later still gets you hooked to what is going on.
  Many of us in the SF community have films we will watch time and again to uplift us from time to time. `PROBE' is one of mine. Have a look for yourself and see if I'm right. End run.",1311465600,10,4192,4.668021680216802
4511228,5,B00501LJI6,"What a great childhood memory! Congratulations to Warner Archives for choosing to release this gem on DVD. For its time, Probe was a fascinating and very well done production; and the Search series was equally impressive.

As a 10-year old action/intrigue/scifi/technogadget-loving boy, I was hooked on Search from the first scene I laid my eyes on; but I couldn't watch it regularly, and over the years, I forgot the title of the series.

Then, a couple of years ago (almost 35 years after it went off the air) I ran across the Probe opening title sequence on YouTube, which eventually led me to discover the ""probe_control"" discussion group on Yahoo. I felt like I'd hit paydirt.

Since that time, I've watched as my fellow fans in ""probe_control"" hoped, prayed, and campaigned for Probe (and Search) to be released on DVD. And now, here we are, tasting sweet success with Probe, thanks to the fine folks at Warner Archives. Good stuff!

Our next fervently-held hope is that Warner Archives will be able to release the entire series on DVD. That would be the pice de rsistance! :-)",1305849600,27,1083,4.806451612903226
4511229,5,B00501LJI6,"Warner Archive, in answer to a query on their Face Book page, says the copy of the movie they put on the DVD is an overseas theatrical release print.

They made the best possible choice in the matter, and it shows they didn't just slap on the first thing they found lying around.  The pilot has many different versions in circulation....most of which are missing one opening scene or another.  The Archive release has the complete version of the film...as well as the rotating diamond commercial bumpers.  Probe was released on VHS years ago, was missing the ""telephone call"" scene, and the bumpers had been edited out.  (To read about the different versions, please go here:

[...]
Both Probe, and the follow-up series Search made good use of visual commercial bumpers to enhance the breaks in the story for the necessary commercial breaks.  So including them in this release was another choice on their part.

For a release that had no remastering, the picture quality is excellent.  It even looks great played on a Blu-Ray that upscales the image for the HD flatscreen.

This is the release that fans of Probe and Search have been waiting decades for.  Buy it just for its own quality, and as a way to say we want Search released on DVD.  The Archive has reported on their web site that they are putting Search through DVD clearance, so this may be the wish come true for a large fan base that has been pining away for a one season wonder that never saw US syndication.",1305849600,48,1472,4.597701149425287
4511230,5,B00501LJI6,"Another favorite.

You know how, sometimes you re-watch a film from your youth, only to discover how absolutely horrid the movie actually is when viewed through adult eyes? Good example of this for me was the unbelievably crappy Cowboys & Dinosaurs flick '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Valley-of-Gwangi/dp/B0000B1OGD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Valley of Gwangi</a>'. And when I was about ten-years old that was one of the coolest films I had ever seen. Carried that fond memory for most of my life; until I was about thirty and had a chance to finally catch it on a TCM special about, you guessed it, B movies.

Good Lord - what a steaming turd pile. :-D

Point being: A childhood memory is often just that, and you shouldn't venture into finding that special movie if you want to cherish those memories.

However, if you're very very lucky, the memory stands the test of time and maybe even enhances it. For me - this perfectly describes Probe with Hugh O'Brian, Elke Summer, and John Gieguld. Also known as the pilot movie launching the tv series ""Search"".

I could say it was simply a secret agent/treasure hunt show - but that would be an incredibly poor disservice to this fun fantastic flick. This was the equivalent of every globe-trekking adventure, treasure hunt seeking, sexy babe scoping, ultra secret service, ber modern hi-tech gizmo wielding, kicking Nazi butt story a kid could ever imagine!

And despite the framing of the times, the antiquated technology holds up very well nearly forty years later. Most of what's seen was prognosticated by decades - biometric security, personal GPS location, night-vision/FLIR cameras transmitting live imagery, real-time medical diagnostics/analysis, and a secure global satellite communications array were all on display in the World Securities Corporation HQ, aka Probe Central, decades before they became reality.

To this very day, when news about our special forces carrying with them the very tools/gadgets that Operative Lockwood (O'Brian) carried into the field with him - and in him - I have to smile. I get the feeling that the armed forces research and development branches are filled with former kids, not unlike myself, who were once influenced by spy/action/thrillers just like 'Probe'.

Finally, on a note of personal embarrassment, for a good two decades I honestly thought ""The ntourage Collection"" was real - spending countless hours at various libraries trying to find some kind of reference book to learn more about those amazing stones.

4511233,5,B00501LJI6,"This pilot for the early 70's one-season show ""Search"" holds up well 40+ years later.  From the first notes of the jaunty theme music watching this again takes me back to my early teens.  The premise is that a secret security apparatus has developed a cutting edge miniaturized camera/audio device with a host of sensors linked through sattelite telemetry to  Probe Control.  Agents can wear the device on some rather gaudy jewelry (medallion, cuff links, ring) that unless you're Sammy Davis Jr. you'd have a hard time pulling off.  Our globe trotting operative in the pilot, Hugh O'Brian plays Lockwood who gets tasked to help track down some missing diamonds that were stolen by the Nazis during the war.  Lockwood has the support of a hi-tech team who he can hear through an audio implant; they can monitor his and other people's vital signs, provide data search information, linguistic translation and more unbeknown to those around him.  This was high speed stuff back in the day, of course now anyone with an iPhone and a Fitbit can do 90% of what Probe Control did back then.  Notable on the Probe Control team is Burgess Merideth as Cameron, the leader of the crew, gorgeous Angel Tompkins is the medical monitor who apparently has had some sort of relationship in the past with Lockwood.  You also get the stunning Elke Sommer whose character's mother may have the key to the location of the missing diamonds and Sir John Gielgud plays an expert gemologist.  All in all it's great fun and surprisingly not too cheesy by current standards.  I enjoyed watching it so much I bought the entire series ""Search"" and am looking forward to reliving this inventive short-lived series.",1466208000,3,1685,4.83623693379791

I loved it then, and love it now, all for the same reasons -- high-tech (for its day!), snappy dialog, and a believable ""secret agent"" who can tap into just about anything he needs, from infra-red ""sniper scope"" help getting out of a locked room to information and language translation right when he needs it. A one-season series, which was called ""Search,"" the format changed into a ""rotating hero"" format similar to the late-60s series ""The Name of the Game."" The stars were Hugh O'Brian, Tony Franciosa, and Doug MacLure, respectively ""Probe One,"" ""Omega Probe,"" and ""Back-Up Probe"" (the latter designation would cause a few rude snickers these days, I'm sure).

Cutting-edge in its time, it's dated by today's standards; even so, it's a delightful romp that I'm delighted to see available... even if it's in the ""I won't play on your computer, in case you're a thief or pirate"" format.

I REALLY envied Hugh Lockwood his hair and sideburns (c'mon, it was the early 70's).

Of course, today, much of it is nonsense:  anyone with a Garmin bursts out laughing at the idea that Lockwood has to be patched in to the Naval Observatory to find his way around.  And certainly some of the double entendres are juvenile and sexist.

None of this, however, really takes anything away from this wonderful movie or its series.  I enjoyed nearly every minute of it, both then and now!

If you grew up in the '60's or earlier, and if you enjoyed such shows as ""The Time Tunnel"", ""The Man From Uncle"", the ""NBC Mystery Movies"" +++ I think you will find this to be wonderfully reminiscent of your past. If you are looking to compare filming and special effects to modern day counterparts, I'm sure you will readily find faults. But this movie/pilot (I believe) lead to a show called: ""Search"" that had a weekly change of characters trying to solve crimes, mysteries and the like-all were handsome, leading men with charisma, some fancy technology (of that era) and interesting stories. It all started with ""Probe""!
I give it thumbs up but will have to add a laugh (thanks to my kids) that that robe looks like the one warn in a song called ""Thrift Shop""-Hey, perhaps that's the point?",1365552000,,956,4.531791907514451
4511274,3,B00501LJI6,"Years ago, I saw the main title sequence on YouTube, and I was impressed. The Maurice Binder-like design and the catchy-dated lounge music theme song got me hooked. I wanted to see this movie, as well as the rest of the series. I guess there's a reason why this film took so long to get a DVD release and why it's a publish on demand only product.
  Out hero is Hugh O'Brien, perhaps one of the most un-charasmatic leading man ever. The guy delivers his lines like he's in a bad '50s film noir. His face is in a constant smirk, reminiscent to Eric Roberts, and is somehow a ladies man, because the script says so. The script tries to give him Bond-like witty dialogue, but he is no Sean Connery. Hell, he's no George Lazenby for that matter. Burgess Merideth is great, as usual, considering he's limited to one set only in this film. Also featuring Elke Sommer and Angel Tomkins, who are at their most beautiful perhaps. But the plot is so predictable. You'll know the villain when you see him.
  It's a great concept; field agents equipped with monitoring devices so unseen experts can assist him. Here's an example, though, of then-awesome gadgetry; the tiny camera O'Brien is given is about the size of a silver dollar. He wears it on his ring and points it everywhere. Imagine how subtle that it. Or he wears it on the end of his gold-chain necklace over his turtle-neck! I don't know, I wasn't around then. Maybe in 1972, that was considered casual dress. The theme song, as said before, was catchy. But it appears to be the only music composed for the pilot, because it's used ad-nausium throughout!
  In short, this movie was stupid and predictable. I think it's a good thing that lost movies are now getting a new chance to rise from their obscurity. Buy for curiosity or nostalgia. But it's not all that interesting. If the rest of the series gets a release, I might give that a try, because as I said before, it's an interesting premise.

4511282,3,B00501LJI6,"This DVD is the pilot for the NBC show ""Search"" from Leslie Stevens (The Outer Limits). Features Jacklyn Smith (Charlie's Angels) in her first speaking role...as well as Sir John Gielgud in his first TV role.

Got the DVD to replace a VHS copy I had recorded years ago from TV. The quality is fantastic...except for a faint line running down the right side of the screen. It may be the audio track impression from the master they used to make the DVD.

The worst part of this DVD is it will not play in many PC DVD drives. Mentions on the rear cover that it is only for DVD readers...not DVD burners and may not work in these units. Without a standalone player...but PC's with DVD drives...this is the reason I gave it only three stars. On my Xbox 360...got a picture but not audio. Was lucky the DVD would play in a new DVD on a new PC I had just gotten. Out of over 300 commercially pressed DVD's I have played on my PC and 360...this was the only one which would not play. This being the case...Warner Brothers and their duplicating service had better practice better quality control if they don't want returns.

Before ordering these TV show single DVD's...make sure you have hardware which will allow the disc to play. If not...you may be out of luck.",1322956800,10,1256,4.405172413793103
4511283,5,B00501LJI6,"Finally, the release of ""Probe"". I couldn't believe it.
I've been waiting for this moment for a very long time. It was one of my favourite shows growing up in the '70's. And the theme by Dominic Frontiere is a theme you cannot forget.
What a show. Far ahead of its time.
All we need now is the release of ""Search"". WBTV,are you taking note.",1322438400,4,340,4.246153846153846

8450590,4,B00501LJI6,"This 1972 TV movie is especially recommended if you are a fan of Hugh O'Brian or Elke Sommer, both of whom look good here.  In particular, this is a star turn for O'Brian, who excels as a handsome, dashing secret agent type.  Pluses for this film include an excellent cast and a light--but not silly--humorous touch.  This movie is also a nice reminder for those of us who remember what is now  a totally lost art form, the broadcast network made-for-TV movie.
  On a more critical note, the movie has some action, but not a lot.  Just about enough to keep the plot from sagging too much.  The plot itself does not bear too close examination, but the film is enjoyable enough that I didn't mind.  Recommended for fans of Elke, and especially fans of Hugh.",1485216000,3,755,4.492647058823529
8450591,5,B00501LJI6,"Just finished watching ""Probe"" released by Warner Brothers.
Created, written, and produced by Leslie Stevens, ""Probe"" and ""Search"" - the subsequent television series that was spun off from the movie - was perhaps the last of the great adventure/spy television shows that grew out of the 1960s and early 1970s.
""Probe"" follows agent Hugh Lockwood as he is assigned by the PROBE = Program Retreival Operations Business Enterprise - to recover a cache of nine diamonds that was lost near the end of World War Two.
With the help of a team of computer and medical specialists at PROBE headquarters, who communicate with him through a series of nanotechnology implants in his teeth and ears, Lockwood is able - most of the time - one up his opponents by using the advanced technology.
Perhaps the most intriguing thing about ""Probe"" is how well the show has aged.  There is only a little dating of the technology.
""Probe"" is an engrossing techno-spy thriller that is great fun to watch.
Highly Recommended!
Five Stars!",1483228800,6,1012,4.883720930232558

8450594,5,B00501LJI6,"This was the pilot for a series called Search.  The movie was pretty good and had some ground breaking technological ideas at the time.  Of course, by today's standards its primitive, but I really enjoyed the performances of all the actors - a lot of whom are now dead.  Hugh O'Brian died earlier this year.  He was very good in this series.",1480377600,,341,4.451612903225806
