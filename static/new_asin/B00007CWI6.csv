1807280,5,B00007CWI6,Its very simple-this is the best instructional drum product ever. Thankyou Steve Smith.,1071187200,2,87,5.769230769230769
1807281,3,B00007CWI6,"The DVD provides some good information.  But it is not for beginning drummers!  Probably will be more useful as I gain experience.  Overall, Steve is clearly a great drummer, but value wise.  I would say cut the price a bit.",1054512000,10,224,4.525
1807282,5,B00007CWI6,"Steve is truly a great drummer and teacher. I have dozens of instructional videos and this is by far the best, truly worth every penny. The solos alone are worth the price. The sections on hand technique(both tradtitional and match stick) are just breathtaking, I simply wanted to cry.  Plus the sound/camara work/menu system are all top notch and almost every solo has an alternate commentary track, so you can listen to Steve discuss the different techniques used while playing. Also, something I havn't seen touched on before in a drum video, is the history of the US beat. Steve gives a very interesting history of drumming, explaining where many of the styles seen today came from...",1042588800,,688,4.880341880341881
1807283,5,B00007CWI6,"The best instructional video/DVD ever, more than 4:30 hours, including PDF files with charts and exercises!! Awesome!!
I'll be spending the next couple of years studying with ""my personal"" teacher Steve Smith.",1042156800,9,209,5.5625
1807284,5,B00007CWI6,"Do you want to be a good drummer?? with a good Drumset Technique?? you better buy this DVD and do your homework, cuz it helped me a lot... if your not gonna buy it, then i can tell you that you're loosing a lot...",1039996800,2,213,3.8636363636363638
1807285,5,B00007CWI6,"This DVD is outstanding.  Steve breaks down his well respected playing technique and offers numerous tips on how to improve.  Also, if you want to understand different types of drumming styles, and how your favorite styles came to be, this DVD offers insight.  Or if you simply want to watch one of the top 25 greatest drummers of all time playing at his best, this is a DVD you don't want to miss.",1039478400,4,398,4.424657534246576
1807286,5,B00007CWI6,One of the best instructional DVD's I have seen. Steve is a monster drummer and a great teacher. The information on his left hand technique is worth the price of the DVD by itself.,1038096000,,180,4.323529411764706
1807287,5,B00007CWI6,"I have to start off by saying, I was truly humbled by the ability of Steve Smith to not only deliver the ""what"" in his drum playing, but most importantly to those of us who are students of the drum set, the ""how"".  I sat and watched what I feel is the very best drummer I have ever seen.  Not to take anything away from the likes of Neal Pert or the other giants.  Steve Smith does something in this set that I did not think was possible.  He never misses a beat!!  I challenge anyone who knows anything about drums.  And I'm saying beginner to stage concert drummer, watch this carefully and see if you see any flaws.  Its the most incredible thing I've ever watched.
Now, as for the instruction.  The first thing I picked up was, and yes I will admit it, I have been holding my sticks wrong all of these years and couldn't figure out why I couldn't develop hand speed.  And it is such a simple exercise.  Then came the feet.  Did anyone know about that double toe to heel move?  Steve can make a single base almost sound like a double.  Truly amazing stuff, and again, what a simple exercise.  Are we picking up on the common denominator here?  He truly makes his instruction easy to understand and practice.  I am currently trying to reinvent myself as a drummer having given it up during a marriage where someone in my life saw no value in beating on drums.
Now for those of you who are wondering if it is worth the cost.  Well lets just break that down.  What is it worth to you to be able to truly improve your expressive talents.  Really folks that what drumming is, you don't want to sound like the other guy, you want to sound like you.  Get this DVD set it it absolutely worth the money.  And prepare to be humbled by the true master of the drumset.  Happy drumming and thanks for reading.",1231027200,,1799,4.244837758112094
1807288,4,B00007CWI6,"Mr. Smith is a consummate drummer.  Educated in technique he conveys his playing style in very enjoyable ""drum lesson style"" sessions.  He breaks down everything from grip to bass drum technique.  It is like having him come to your home for private lessons.

If you work with him to absorb and understand, your playing will improve vastly (IF you practice).",1217548800,,357,4.9
1807289,5,B00007CWI6,"This is a great DVD to use to advance your skills.  Possibly the best out there.  It works well if you are an intermediate to advanced drummer.  Probably a little much if you are a beginner.

He does a great job of breaking down each component of a drummers skill set.  He does not just blow things by the student -- he really seems to want to teach you.  And he succeeds at it.  Bissonette's DVD does not even come close.",1190851200,,422,4.135802469135802
1807290,4,B00007CWI6,"Understanding our musical heritage has greater, more tangible affect than one might realize. Steve does an excellent job of very quickly giving the student a walk through musical time. The effect for me was a revelation of why some musicians today can swing or groove, and some cannot. For example, understanding the evolution of the drum set itself provides a vision of the core elements in playing and time keeping that spell the difference between swinging or not swinging.

The History portion is on the second CD, and I think that CD alone is worth the cost of the package. But the first CD is packed with great stuff, as well. I have spent most of my time playing back Steve's explanation of grip (BTW, pausing the video is a great way to see the details), having come to my own conclusion that how you hold the sticks is a very large part of the difference between playing okay and playing great. (Somebody is saying, ""Duh!"" But I'll bet a good majority of today's drummers don't give much thought to grip once they learn the paradiddle).

Steve's pacing in dissemination of information is easy to follow and, compared to similar training videos, well articulated. As always, the key is to resist the tempation to spend all your time watching Steve's solos rather than meticulously digesting the stuff that will actually improve your playing. (I'm actually getting a great deal of insight comparing Steve's demonstration of grip with Joe Morrello's explantion of the same topic on Joe's DVD).

If the DVD set has any shortcomings, I would say the extra digital material in the form of PDF files are lacking. Having had the opportunity to take a lesson from Steve, I asked him for insight on his practice routine. He told me to get and watch his DVD (nice sales plug, Steve--grin). I pushed him on this and asked if there were any secrets he might have held back from the DVD. He said no and indicated that there was an excellent PDF containing some great practice helps. So I expected to find some sort of planning tool, something I could actually print out and use. What I found was a single page of (albeit good) tips on better practicing, one or two of which I personally disagree with.

Other than that, if you are serious about taking your playing to the next level, the money for the DVD set should be no object.

Practice on!",1181606400,7,2339,4.626506024096385
1807291,5,B00007CWI6,"It's a good DVD to learn!! Ho year!!

Good pratice and pedagogy it's very good!!

I love Steve pedagogy and groove. It's so good to learn and ear him!!

Enjoy!!!",1177027200,,161,4.3
1807292,5,B00007CWI6,"This DVD is very informative. Steve breaks drum set playing down to a simple, easy to understand format. People who aren't even drummers have enjoyed watching this DVD. There also is footage showing why he is a ""drummer's drummer"".",1169164800,,231,4.948717948717949
1807293,5,B00007CWI6,"Steve Smith is a total class act. Even after all his massive success, he is still such a student of drumming. His knowledge is comprehensive and his technique is flawless. You can't go wrong with this one!",1163808000,2,205,4.5675675675675675
1807294,5,B00007CWI6,"Well done. Steve's DVD is a great buy for beginners and people interested in the roots of U.S. music.

This is classroom quality stuff. Demonstrating the drumkit from start to current, playing along side ""The Historical band"" was remarkable. As a Drummer as I watched the DVD I could feel Steve's passion for teaching. I believe he truly wants to help pepople find and improve their groove.

If you just want a dvd on techiqnue this one demonstrates several areas. Some basic, some not so basic. All motivating.

Can't wait to see is next one",1153267200,2,542,4.684210526315789
1807295,5,B00007CWI6,I've always been a Journey Fan and Steve Smith was the drummer for a long time. This 2 DVD set is awesome if you truly want to educate yourself about drumming. Steve Smith is a gifted and talented drummer who explains technique and styles. I knew Steve was a great drummer but I know now that he is even better than I ever imagined. Steve is a great teacher and his love of music shines. I can truly say I learned a lot from him. The 2nd DVD covers the history of music and the evolution of drums in music; I found his presentation well done and interesting. I loved this DVD!!,1152403200,,577,4.160714285714286
1807296,5,B00007CWI6,This is an excellent DVD from Steve. It is very professional and is easy to view and understand. I really enjoyed Steve's explaination of the hand and foot techniques. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wishes to explore how they can improve their drumming.,1152144000,,270,4.76595744680851
1807297,4,B00007CWI6,"I have nothing but the highest respect for Steve Smith and this DVD. Steve does an amazing job at communicating a history of the US Drumming, his teaching style is relaxed and to the point, and his skill is amazing.

Definately buy this DVD, But....

The only thing I didn't like about it, and the reason for my 4 stars, is that Steves history of the US beat finishes up at the fusion style - ie around the 70's. Um.. hello? Drumming or US drumming didn't stop at the 70's dude!

I think it would have been really valuable to go through how drumming and music styles changed through the 80's, 90's and today, especially with the electronic styles that are used today.

I think for a young drummer coming through in 2006, while its great to know how to play all the styles Steve covers, the reality is these styles just aren't that popular, when pitted against rock, metal, and all modern electronic styles. How many people do you see at a jazz fusion gig, compared to a Groove Armada gig?

And yes I realise this is a HISTORY of the US beat, and hence the importance on these older styles, but again, what about the 80's 90's and early 2000's?

That's my only knock and a small one, the information in this DVD really is thorough and outstanding. BUY IT!",1147564800,7,1254,4.383620689655173
1807298,5,B00007CWI6,"I got this DVD about a month ago, and have only recently finished watching it. It's very long - 2 DVDs, over 4.5 hours - but it certainly doesn't get any weaker as it progresses. Steve has a great enthusiasm about him, like he really wants to teach, and teach he does. He gives good descriptions of the techniques he uses, and performs a range of detailed demonstrations, often including songs. These include playing with traditional grip, a range of foot techniques (including heel-toe), practice and exercises, licks and phrases, independece/co-ordination, and an extensive coverage of 'implied metric modulation', similar yet different to polyrhythms.

Some people may not care for his style of playing (jazz fusion), but even they can't dispute the thoroughness of his lessons.

His second DVD 'History of the US Beat' sees Steve evolving his kit to resemble those of the time he describes. He covers 'eras' like early New Orleans jazz, big band, rhythm and blues, rock'n'roll, funk, and more, always giving a short(ish) performance to demonstrate. At the end of this second DVD, Steve and his band (Vital Information) play seven complete tunes featuring applications of the techniques explained on disc 1.

It's fairly pricey, but for two DVDs jam-packed with quality instruction from one of the world's great drummers, it's very much worth it. It's suitable for beginners and intermediate drummers alike, and with a multitude of extras, definately deserves the big 5 stars.",1142985600,3,1479,5.154166666666667
1807299,5,B00007CWI6,"I purchased Steve Smith's first instructional video over 15 years ago and at that time, was blown away by his fluidity and mastery of the instrument.  What this DVD shows is not only a representation of how Smith has developed into an even more masterful player, but also shows his unmatched study of the history of the instrument and how others have developed stylistic approaches over the past century and a half.  Smith covers two lifetimes worth of study in two separate DVDs...Technique and History of the US Beat. This DVD set is not necessarily for the beginner, but is a great study for all levels for both performance and for integral learning.  Smith covers so much ground with this set that it can shave off years worth of self-study for any level player.  Everything about this set is positive with the only exception being Smith's sort of dry demeanor.  You can know that Smith loves performing and speaking about the instrument, but it all seems a little too calculated.  Even in his performances, he can appear very ""robotic"".  Nonetheless, he simply rules his domain.  Don't let his detour with Journey fool you into thinking he is a one-dimensional player.  Quite the contrary...he is one of the best on the planet.  Buy this set for you and for your student.--Stephen.",1142812800,2,1286,4.804545454545455
1807300,5,B00007CWI6,"The drummer I work with saw a Steve Smith clinic a few years back and really was blown away by the experience. I surprised him with this DVD and he really loved it. I cannot speak on the specific merits of this product, but he sure seems to value it.",1141862400,,250,4.02
1807301,5,B00007CWI6,"I have never played the drums but I decided that I needed to learn more about drumming and complex rhythm in order to improve my songwriting.

I had a bad opinion of drums because, face it:  most rock drummers are incapable of playing under other instruments, have no dynamic control, don't know how to tune their kit, and think that china cymbals are for imitating the sound of an SUV crashing through a plate glass window.

I never imagined what drums could do in the hands of a master.  Steve Smith is an extraordinary musician and very gifted teacher.  He has a scholarly knowlege of the history of his art, and his illustration of historical drumming styles is fascinating.

The quality of musicianship and pedagogy on this DVD set is first rate, and I plan to get a lot of use from it as I learn the basics of drumming.",1131753600,2,825,4.466666666666667
1807302,5,B00007CWI6,"This package is worth ever cent of your money. There is simply no greater educational DVD package out at the moment. Steve goes over technique in unbelievable detail, and his knowledge of drumset / popular music history is really interesting. I definitely recommend this package to any drumset player.  This video was voted the #1 DVD in the 2003 Modern Drummer readers' poll AND was featured by Vic Firth online.  You can get it a lot cheaper at [...]",1104710400,6,452,4.708860759493671
1807303,5,B00007CWI6,"Having bought lots of so called instructional DVD's, and being disappointed with the majority of them, I was very reluctant to buy this DVD.

Being a rock-oriented drummer, my personal influences are far more different, so I was a little bit prejudiced towards fusion type drummers, as their main strength is their technical ability, but some of them are lacking in terms of feeling, power and passion required and unable to create a ""pulse"" as defined by Steve himself.

Steve Smith is awesome and inspiring and he blew my mind away. One should not dare to criticise Steve Smith as a drummer because he definitely is one of the masters of drumming.

I believe that intermediate and advanced drummers can really learn from this DVD and improve themselves as a result. The information given on drumset technique is a very valuable tool and it opened my eyes on some issues even after 17 years of playing. I liked the ""history of the U.S beat"" part very much, especially the incredible performance with the ""Vital Information"".",1100044800,14,1025,4.845714285714286
1807304,5,B00007CWI6,"Steve Smith is definitely an icon within the drumming community, and he deserves to be so.  Besides being a virtuoso at the drums, Steve proves himself to be very musically inclined.  From his techincal ability to his knowledge of the history of great American music, this DVD explains it all.  As with anything and anyone we look up to, whether it be in music or just in everyday life, drum DVD's are designed to expand and give insight to what we are or are not familar with.  If you're searching for a ""shortcut"" to becoming a great drummer, then this DVD may not be for you.  For those with a passion for drumming, or just music in general, I believe Steve Smith's DVD will not leave you disappointed.",1094256000,2,705,4.4765625
1807305,5,B00007CWI6,"First off: I was never a huge fan of Journey, so any effusive prose that may come from the tips of my little fingoids as I type is not coming from there.  ;o)  Steve is one of the most well-rounded and musically diverse drummers that I've ever seen. He plays it all and does it amazingly well. I've been playing since 1964 and have taught my son to play and am now starting to teach my grandson. My son was blown away when he came to my house and watched some of this DVD with me. In less than an hour, Steve had shown my son an appreciation for diverse musicial styles that I'd been trying to open him up to for years. Steve is *that* good as a teacher. I don't think I've ever seen better. While I would indeed rank this as an intermediate-to-advanced instructional DVD, he succeeds wonderfully in communicating his techniques for expanding your own expertise on the drums. The only thing that I find a drawback is that when I watch it, I am distinctly jealous of those just starting out in their young drumming careers today and who have great instruction like this to begin with. :o) This is amazing stuff. I own many drum technique video/DVD sets and this is the best of the breed. If I could give it 10 stars, I would. Thanks Steve for giving fresh inspiration to a grandpa who still loves to drum and who can't wait for his next chance to kick some ass behind the kit, and is truly grateful that I can get this kind of instruction to my son and grandson so that one day they can blast past the old man -- but they're going to have to work at it to do so, I ain't giving in that easy! ;o)",1074729600,46,1594,4.172077922077922
1807306,5,B00007CWI6,"I never thought I'd call a $50 DVD a great value, but this is.  Disc #1 is your own personal lesson with the Master himself.  The hand and foot techniques are tremendous.  I really enjoy disc #2.  The historic band with Steve on a vintage drum set is a treat.  Then they get into a long set with Vital Information where you can see the practical applications of the techniques he taught in disc #1.  Be sure to check out the extras.  I didn't see the hi-hat thing at first, but WOW.  I had no idea you could do that with a hi-hat!
A nice feature is that you have the option to play only the music without the talking in between, or even just the solos if that's all you're in the mood to view.
I don't have any other instructional DVD's to compare this to, but it was recommended to me by a pro as the ONE to get.  I have to agree!",1071705600,22,831,3.987878787878788

Steve is an amazing drummer and this is good to watch on a long airline flight because it's not about drumming with him, it's about him drumming for your information.

For shear drum playing knowledge the Tommy Igoe and Joe Morello videos are a better investment and you can get them right here on Amazon (that's where I bought them :-)

Be sure and watch all the bonus stuff on the 2nd DVD- the high-hat solos are awesome!
