3857462,4,B0026XUOOQ,"Perhaps directed at the teen audience. Definitely approved for family friendliness. Good moral basics but no preaching. It just seems this 12 year old Mary, a naive matchmaker, who mates dogs with owners as well as people, is a bit far fetched. But sometimes that's fun. So give this newcomer star a break. After all from here, Katherine McNamara has snagged more jobs, & will be Becky Thatcher in a 2013 ""Tom Sawyer."" She did as good a job as seasoned professionals. That's one of the fun things about viewing these lower budget films, see stars in the making.

Can't complain about the acting of vets like animal rescuer Banks (Jeff Fahey-convincing as the Dr. in `Marriage Retreat') and of course bubbly Aunt Karen (Dee Wallace-`10' `ET' + lots) who buddies up with Mary on matchmaking attempts. It was she that matched Mary's parents together originally. Now they struggle. This marital discord part of the storyline seems to get remedied much too easily. And too many loves at 1st sight. The films greatest flaw (for some maybe not a flaw) is that it borders being too ultra sweet; like hot fudge with chocolate sprinkles over a chocolate a-le-moded dark chocolate brownie topped with a cordial cherry drop. Puckering sweet. Some funny laughs too. All clean fun, Dove Foundation 4 of 5 fun, for all ages.

Of course the unpredictable antics of a trio of beige puppies, Tillie, Lexie, and Bailey, are as fun as Lassie, Shiloh, Benji or Toto. So this mix of seasoned and fresh faces, combined with animal magnetism creates a film worthy of rental or at today's prices since it's a 2008 movie, even a purchase.

NO Subtitles or CC. Bonus is 13 minutes of behind the scenes + trailer.",1321142400,,1685,4.744027303754266

3857464,1,B0026XUOOQ,"We found this movie at our local library, and I'm glad we didn't waste money renting or buying it.  Being a Pureflix film, we were expecting a lot more.  The acting doesn't have to be superb for us to enjoy a movie, but there were other things that we just didn't like.

First of all the music is so loud that you can barely hear what anyone is saying.  But the most important points are:  For a family movie, I found it disturbing that Aunt Karen was trying to pick a ""sexy"" dress for her date.  Also, a couple of scenes where cleavage is shown...so unnecessary.  We have three young daughters and I didn't appreciate the fact that the girl in this movie walked up to a strange man alone and took him by the hand.  In this day and age that just isn't wise.

I can't recommend this movie as a family movie.",1309651200,4,806,4.181818181818182
3857465,4,B0026XUOOQ,"This is a marvelous little indie film that's liable to steal your heart and leave you smiling with its simple yet profound message about loving and caring for one another. The story revolves around seventh-grader Mary, three adorable animal-shelter puppies, and the six adults who come together thanks to Mary's well-meaning matchmaking efforts. The filmakers wisely eschew typical over-the-top, razzle-dazzle Hollywood production values in order to concentrate on telling a sweet story in a straightforward, uncomplicated way that most viewers will relate to personally. All the characters are well acted but ultimately this film belongs to the charming young newcomer Katherine McNamara who plays the title role of Mary. She is so natural, sincere, and irresistibly likeable in every scene in which she appears that it's easy to root for her and the success of her character's innocent schemes. Let's hope that we see more of Katherine McNamara in future films.",1280016000,3,963,5.3841059602649
8353756,2,B0026XUOOQ,"A very disappointing film.  The plot is boring and  the acting is mediocre.
The teen girl cast as Mary is too sugary sweet.  She doesn't seem real.
The only appealing part was the 3 puppies.
I don't recommend this film for any age.",1493769600,,231,4.325581395348837

8353764,5,B0026XUOOQ,Just watched this movie on Netflix and now I'm gonna buy it from Amazon! I loved it so much! It's so sweet and anything that involves helping animals and people make my day! Yes.. there are some things that people can't do this day and age but this is why we have movies about how the world should be. People of all ages should be able to become friends and help one another.  I highly recommend this movie. It made me feel good and cry a little. I would give anything to be healthy again and go out and make friends and help hands-on with animals and people again. Movies like this give you hope for others and for a better world. Enjoy!,1348012800,,638,4.186991869918699
8353765,3,B0026XUOOQ,"Matchmaker Mary is a story about a pre-teen Mary (Katherine McNamara) young girl who stumbles into a knack for fixing up singles using her newly-earned puppy as a tool to bring lonely people together. Children older than about ten would not find this story very entertaining as the relationship concepts are downsized to age group of eight to ten or so. Girls may find the story more intriguing than boys. The character Aunt Karen (Dee Wallace) saves the story from what would be an otherwise disastrous attempt to make a believable movie. Miss Wallace brings a sense of normalcy and warmth to the situations.

The viewer is shielded from the real problems and reality of the relationship of Mary's parents. This is where we get into trouble with the plot line. The director (Tom Whitus: Silence; Sam Steele and the Junior Detective; The Wild Card) fails miserably to properly guide the viewer through the plot. The actors have the raw material to provide a great performance, but it is the director's job to bring out the best performances of each person. Mr. Whitus deserves an 'F' on this term paper project.

This story needs to be remade ala Sidney Pollack / Harrison Ford / Kristen Scott Thomas / Bonnie Hunt style. It would be a 'A' rated movie if more effort were put into developing the characters' motivations, personas, and depth. The actors in this movie have the potential to approach these heights, the director failed to challenge them in their roles. For example, why is the wife (Cynthia Hyer) so unhappy? We never find out. All we know is, she's in-love with her job (or her boss). The hallow finale also leaves us scratching our heads. Nothing in the marriage relationship changes for the better, the husband and wife just agree to continue being unhappily married. No resolutions are put forth to solve the marital problems. Simply an agreement is reached to quit arguing about it.

The story is worthwhile for younger children because the puppies are so cute and it hides the reality of marriage relationships. Older children and adults will find the story puzzling and unfulfilled. Three stars for children ages 8 to 10 and 1 star for everyone else. We need a remake, please! The story and the actors have GREAT potential. New director on the set!",1330300800,,2269,4.797953964194374
