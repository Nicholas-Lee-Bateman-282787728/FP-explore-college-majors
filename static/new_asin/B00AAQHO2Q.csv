5406534,3,B00AAQHO2Q,Good,1434499200,,4,4.0
5406535,3,B00AAQHO2Q,Gets kind of repetitive. I also think they stock the pond.,1432080000,,58,4.363636363636363

5406537,2,B00AAQHO2Q,"I started out a few years ago enjoying watching this with my kids.  This year, I got tired of hearing all the ""beeps"" in place of the foul language.  Since it appears to be less family friendly, I am forced to stop watching",1425945600,,223,4.162790697674419
5406538,5,B00AAQHO2Q,I like all the Storage Wars episodes.  Great cast and fun to watch.,1425859200,,67,4.153846153846154

5406540,5,B00AAQHO2Q,Enjoyed this dvd!,1421020800,,17,5.0
5406541,4,B00AAQHO2Q,It's good but not the same without Barry Weiss,1420156800,,46,4.222222222222222
5406542,5,B00AAQHO2Q,"If you watch Jeff Dunham, watch this clip!",1418860800,,42,4.375
5406543,5,B00AAQHO2Q,passed time,1416787200,,11,5.0
5406544,5,B00AAQHO2Q,Lots of interesting interaction between everyone.  I enjoy the treasure,1416787200,,71,6.1
5406545,4,B00AAQHO2Q,Y all  need to make the programing cost less,1411344000,,44,3.888888888888889
5406546,5,B00AAQHO2Q,"Oh, What Fun! You Should Make a 100 of these DVD's! Barry & the Praline King (Donnie) was Great! They Kept Me Laughing All Of  the Time! I Wish You had More of them & Storage Wars",1411257600,,179,3.8378378378378377
5406547,3,B00AAQHO2Q,Its ok. You see a lot of unique items on the show. Some of the people interacting on the show is also entertaining. No show stopper though,1408060800,,138,4.148148148148148
5406548,4,B00AAQHO2Q,"Same old, same old.  Dave forces Barry to overbid for lockers.  Newbies interesting though.  Brandi and Jarrod aren't newbies anymore (she's got a nice set).  They always seem to find something interesting in their lockers (sometimes valuable, sometimes not, but always interesting); maybe Dave Hester's lawsuit about the seeding of lockers was not off-base?",1407110400,,358,5.574074074074074
5406549,5,B00AAQHO2Q,Very interesting and fun to watch.  I loved to watch these guys look for the buried treasures.  But I can not afford to watch the other season $30.00 is just to much for me to spend at this time.  I would recommend these for the entertainment aspect though.,1404691200,,257,4.3125
5406550,5,B00AAQHO2Q,My husband and I totally totally love the show. Is it staged? We don't care.  Do they actually sell all the crap? It's not my money so why should I worry. Are the groups and the prices insane? People I just watch for the entertainment value.,1403395200,,241,4.239130434782608
5406551,4,B00AAQHO2Q,"This DVD is not Storage Wars season 4, as Amazon lead me to believe with it's ""watch now on Prime"" links. This is a mix of late season 2 and early season 3. However, seasons 2 and 3 were great, with 4 being lackluster.",1403222400,,218,3.977272727272727
5406552,3,B00AAQHO2Q,"Loved this series. With all of the controversy behind it, tends to taint the whole thing. Now they are trying to find a new bad guy, regain their focus, and continue on. The odds of someone finding their fortune in a storage locker are slim. They film the very unusual aspects of this profession, and high light it. Still a fun series to watch.",1400716800,,344,4.390625
5406553,1,B00AAQHO2Q,"No Dave.  No Barry.  No show.

I can't stand Brandi and what's his name.  It's like watching two drunks that shop at WalMart putting on a reality show.  Dave and Barry made the show.  Watched two episodes of this season and said no more.  Bring back Dave and Barry, settle your stupid differences and get on with it.",1398643200,,316,4.344827586206897
5406564,5,B00AAQHO2Q,"My husband and I agree we really love to watch this show together, we don't agree on too many but this one.",1393891200,,107,3.909090909090909
5406565,4,B00AAQHO2Q,"This is a fun show for passing the time.  I wouldn't take the ""finds"" too seriously since I believe it is scripted.",1393804800,2,115,4.2272727272727275
5406566,5,B00AAQHO2Q,VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASED ITEM! LOOKED ALMOST NEW! VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE FOUND THIS ITEM COLLECTING THEM ALL THANKS VERY VERY MUCH!!!!!!!A++++++++++++++++ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1391644800,,194,6.8
5406567,5,B00AAQHO2Q,"Yes, it's a little ""campy"" but it is brainless, fun entertainment.  Fun to watch while ironing.  Don't look for too much depth and you will enjoy it.",1380499200,3,149,4.481481481481482
5406568,5,B00AAQHO2Q,Love this show. Much better on dvd then television. No commercials. Can't wait for more volumes to come out. Great price.,1379030400,,121,4.809523809523809
5406569,5,B00AAQHO2Q,"Came quick and in perfect condition. Don't have a single complaint with the product or the customer service. I'm addicted to this show, lol",1376611200,,139,4.833333333333333
5406570,5,B00AAQHO2Q,"Excellent series. People you love, people you love to hate (this means you, Dave). I think they should add a few more just for fun.",1376611200,,131,4.28
5406571,5,B00AAQHO2Q,"I like the way the people pit against each other but don't resort to name calling and fights. It is entertainment, pure and simple.",1375315200,,131,4.5
5406572,5,B00AAQHO2Q,I dropped the dish so getting my loved characters on DVD is my way to go.  Great DVD picture quality.,1375228800,,101,4.05
5406573,3,B00AAQHO2Q,"Sometimes fun, but another video illustration that way too many people have way too much time on their hands. Spend your time watching some great Ken Burns documentaries.",1372636800,2,170,5.107142857142857
5406584,5,B00AAQHO2Q,"Very good bunch of movies, a lot of action and fun. I hope they make more of these good shows.",1370390400,,94,3.75
5406585,5,B00AAQHO2Q,Just as good as the last three seasons. I'm still wondering whatever happened to Dave Hester??? Hope to see more storage wars soon.,1370390400,,131,4.739130434782608
5406586,1,B00AAQHO2Q,"I liked the 1st couple of seasons because I'd learn something interesting about items found in the lockers, but ever since Dave left, there hasn't been any real interesting finds. He did say they put things in the lockers to make them more interesting....",1369353600,2,255,4.818181818181818
5406587,5,B00AAQHO2Q,"My wife is a big fan of Storage Wars. The series always has humor in it. My wife watches these over and over. We now own them all. Wish they did not split the seasons into parts. I understand they (A&E) can make more money but inconvenient. Despite this, the DVD was a success around this house. Enjoy.",1368230400,,302,4.224137931034483
5406588,5,B00AAQHO2Q,"I really enjoy watching Storage Wars and I highly recommend this show! I love the anticipation of waiting to see what treasures are buried in the storage lockers!! Also, in my opinion, this show can be very exciting, and humorous! I am also a huge fan of all of the characters. However, I was very disappointed to see Dave Hester go this season! This show definitely has it's own cool, unique style!! Moreover, to briefly sum it up, basically, the show revolves around a few main characters who bid on used storage lockers. The contents of the lockers can then be kept as treasures, or sold for profit! Be warned, this show can be very addicting!!!",1367539200,2,648,4.594827586206897
5406589,4,B00AAQHO2Q,"This is a great show but come on...just how much ""rare"" stuff do people leave in a storage locker behind their nasty clothes.",1366329600,,125,4.478260869565218
5406590,3,B00AAQHO2Q,The people and the chemistry really what make this show work. Watching the banter amongst them and the bidding wars between makes for light hearted entertainment.,1363824000,,162,5.269230769230769
5406591,1,B00AAQHO2Q,"I rated this I hated it for only one reason Jeff . Without Dave Hester whether you love him , love to hate him or love the Yuuup -The show is very boring - Won't be watching any new shows thats for sure .",1362528000,,204,3.659090909090909
5406592,3,B00AAQHO2Q,Whether you like Hester or not he adds flavor to the show - Without Dave the show is boring .,1362096000,5,93,3.7
5406593,5,B00AAQHO2Q,"I love this series, and the fourth season does not disappoint.  Darryl Sheets has so many spotlight flubs it will bring tears to your eyes!  There is less focus on Dave (thank God) and a new unlikable character who has a big problem with Dan.  All in all, if you love Storage Wars, you'll love this season too.",1361664000,4,310,4.310344827586207

8549294,5,B00AAQHO2Q,"My family is enthralled with this show.  Even the youngest--only six years old--will sit and watch episodes of this show.  There is always running commentary on who their favorite character is or what they think an item is worth.  We've had some laughs, been frustrated with some of the characters, and just overall enjoyed the show.  There were 2 DVDs in the set running over 350 minutes, so plenty of episodes to watch and making the price of 9.99 seem like a nice deal.",1496880000,,472,4.583333333333333

8549298,5,B00AAQHO2Q,GREAT,1452556800,,5,5.0
8549299,2,B00AAQHO2Q,"This ""season"" is kind of beat. It's a mix of several earlier shows with an occasional ""4th season"" auction thrown in to keep it legal.

I really like this show, but this season is a bit of a rip off.",1445212800,,199,3.975
