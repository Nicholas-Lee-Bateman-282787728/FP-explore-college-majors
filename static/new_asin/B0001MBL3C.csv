8014922,4,B0001MBL3C,"My experience with minor brand DVD companies (such as FRONT ROW ENTERTAINMENT or PASSION PRODUCTIONS) has been satisfactory, as I'm not interested in commentary, deleted scenes or other bonus features, that is, stuff these discs don't offer. Transfers are ""best available source"" and quality can vary from very good to only fair.

HONEYMOON IN BALI is a public domainer that's often marketed as ""My Love for Yours."" The picture's original title, ""Are Husbands Necessary?"" was jettisoned when leading lady Madeleine Carroll landed in divorce court.

""Bali"" is the sort of escapist light comedy that was most common during the Great Depression's earlier years. (F. Scott Fitzgerald is rumored to have contributed to the script.) It's the story of Gail Allen, an upscale career gal whose vow to never marry is sorely tried when Bill Burnett (MacMurray), a visitor to Manhattan from Bali, meets and falls in love with her.

When Bill's marriage proposal is rejected by Gail, he returns home. She soon regrets her hasty rejection and follows him halfway around the globe. Gail discovers to her dismay that Noel Van Ness (Massen), who'd been unsuccessfully pursuing Bill for some time, has finally gotten his wedding commitment, so she regretfully departs for New York, her 5th Avenue job and would-be fianc&eacute; Eric Sinclair (Jones). As a rebounding Bill had done in Bali, Gail now does in New York. She agrees to marry Eric. Clearly, as the film's title suggests, this isn't where our story ends.

Besides a solid main cast, this one has an interesting company of uncredited  players:

Madeleine Carroll was a remarkable talent, not unlike Carole Lombard. Here, she shines radiantly amidst swell performances by her supporting cast, most notably Helen Broderick as her wise-cracking, spinster cousin. Carolyn Lee, as Rosie, almost steals the movie - certainly kidnapping the hearts of everyone she encounters.

Great dialogue. Wonderful pacing. Smart, very enjoyable film.",1097798400,2,457,5.705882352941177
