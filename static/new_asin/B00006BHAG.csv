1741458,4,B00006BHAG,"The production quality is great, the sets, costumes, etc. though the camera moves too much. Her cuing is good, attention to detail, use of analogies & the pace is good. But Neena & Veena, Neon, Suhaila, Jenna, Jillina, Sonia, Blanca, Rachael Brice & even Amira (though her form is sloppy too), teach & dance better. Dolphina's form is a bit sloppy, but she still has more fluidity then Rania & Tanna.

There are 3 trailers on her site at Goddessworkout com",1114560000,,456,4.62962962962963
1741459,3,B00006BHAG,I like Dolphina. She's a talented dancer. I just could not keep up with this video. I am a very novice beginner and if you are a beginner please try Neena and Veena's series first. Once you have built up the arm strength I think this would be a fun workout.,1112745600,,257,4.0588235294117645
1741460,4,B00006BHAG,"As a new bellydance student, I was looking for something to practice with between classes. I bought this DVD to give me a little headstart before the instructor brings out the veils. To be honest I've been a huge fan of the Bellytwins, Veena and Neena, so I was a smidge skeptical of Dolphina. But as I worked out with the DVD I found that I caught on better with Dolphina's instructions. It's great for practice. Obviously, it's a workout for beginners, so take it for what it's worth. Just because she doesn't explain all the spiritual meanings or have a hooka-pipe for set dressing, it doesn't mean it's an ""insult"" to bellydancing as that last review suggested. Lighten up, Lady! Have some fun. Which is exactly what this workout disc is.",1093564800,,742,4.628787878787879
1741461,1,B00006BHAG,"Sadly this DVD was TRAGIC!!!!!!!!!
For anyone who has actually studied the wonderful art of Bellydance it is insulting to say the least.
Dolphina has no grasp for the depth of culture or history relating to Bellydance and appears to be from the ""Wiggle and Giggle"" school of Bellydance.
She often described one move and demonstrated something entirely different.
It saddens me that this DVD is portrayed as ""Bellydancing"" and for those who have not experienced the real thing this is a terrible example.",1087344000,,503,5.0
1741462,5,B00006BHAG,"A workout that you won't mind doing again and again. The included veil is convenient but be sure to have adequate space when practicing with it. (If space is a problem, practice the arm movements without the veil then take the veil outside or to a larger area to practice on your own.)",1058227200,,285,4.39622641509434
1741463,5,B00006BHAG,"A good workout that you can truely enjoy. Although beginners should first work with Dolphina's ""Goddess Workout"" tape to learn basic moves. Be sure to have space if using a veil but it is not necessary, as the arm movements can be practiced alone. Of course the veil does make a performance much more visually stunning.",1058227200,,319,4.714285714285714
1741464,2,B00006BHAG,"The moves were not challenging, and the whole time you're repeating movements with Dolphina keeps on saying ""beautiful!!"" a million times ... I bought this VHS because I wanted to try a new workout, however, I don't find it effective ...",1033344000,,237,4.804878048780488
1741465,5,B00006BHAG,"Wonderful  Workout !!!  Great Fun!!! Have a Great Time while stengthening and toning your upper body and feel strong, sexy and feminine all at the same time !!!  What a combination!!!! Dolphina is a lovely instructor and is NOT at all intimidating...  This video is well made, the background is simple, cheery and pleasant and her costumes are lovely but NOT overwelming (you can actually see what she is doing... making it easier to follow ...) and the music has you feeling calm and relaxed all at the same time ;o)...  But you can still feel the burn if you aren't tooo distracted by all the fun you are having ...
I won't stick with an exercise program if it isn't fun (just being honest ;o) ... )  This one will definantly NOT lie arround collecting dust !! It is worth and the time money!!! I would recommend it!  Get it and see for yourself !!!!  ENJOY!!! ENJOY!!  ENJOY!!!",1026950400,,880,4.484276729559748
1741466,5,B00006BHAG,"...other than that, what a blast!! just a quick note: if you have cats (like i do) you may want to remove them from the room before working out, they got just as much as a workout as i did trying to play w/ my veil (the cat did provide extra resistence, though)  :o)",1025827200,,266,3.925925925925926
7966915,4,B00006BHAG,"It has some interesting veil work, some easy some not so easy.  My only problem is Dolphina is full of herself and sometimes you do not get a full view to follow the footwork that goes with the veil movement.",1449705600,,208,4.2
7966916,1,B00006BHAG,"Besides the fact that Dolphina is clearly an inexperienced belly dancer (based on her other videos and the vague bio on her website) she isn't good at teaching. She will explain the move one way, demonstrate it, then when it's time to go full speed she does it a totally different way. If you're not interested in really learning veil work and just want to swish some fabric around in your living room, maybe this is for you. If you want clear instruction that will actually teach you something, look elsewhere. There are lots of other videos on Amazon that are made by actual belly dancers! Here are just a few:

7966917,5,B00006BHAG,"If anyone is interesting in learning to bellydance with veils, this is an excellent dvd.  I highly recommend it.",1281398400,,112,4.894736842105263
7966918,4,B00006BHAG,"I've heard both good and bad things about Dolphina, but honestly, this workout is kind of fun. It worked my arms so well, I was begging for mercy. I love working out with the veil. I gave it four stars because the cool-down part of the workout is a real joke, and because she doesn't really explain how to properly perform some of the moves.",1226275200,,341,4.2615384615384615
7966919,5,B00006BHAG,"If you imagine the life of a goddess, living say on an island of white sand and ocean breezes, then you have captured the mood of Bellydance with Veils. This is an escape to a land where red veils dance in the breeze as you flow to ancient rhythms, awakening the inner goddess or joyful feminine essence.

Dolphina captures the playfulness of dance all while making dancing with veils a celebratory and sensual experience. The movement of the veil allows a freedom of feminine expression all while seriously strengthening the upper body, enhancing posture and giving you a confidence-enhancing workout.

The joyful expression of bellydance is enhanced with veils and not only will you be enjoying a 30 minute cardiovascular routine, you also shape and sculpt your body. I love Dolpina's warm soothing voice and her approach to bellydance is always enlightening and engaging. This is a nurturing workout to return to again and again and is a true bellydance escape for when you want to escape the pressures of modern life.

If you have time, follow this with Barbara Biziou's Momentary Meditations. Your stress will completely dissolve and with dance and meditation you may find a sense of calm descending over the rest of your day.

7966920,5,B00006BHAG,"This was a great deal. I'm so glad I ordered this product. Very spiritual as well as physically healthy. Work-out was short but a good low-impact start for me on the road to bellydancing! Dolphina is the cutie, too. She's only sometimes unintentionally hilarious.

The only thing was the veil in the picture was red and the veil I got was blue which I didn't mind but some people might want to know that the veil color may be different from the picture!",1156032000,,453,4.457831325301205
7966921,4,B00006BHAG,"I bought this at a very good price and had planned to sell it at an upcoming fair.  I decided to try it based on the other reviews. I'm glad I did. My arms were aching from the beginning and I learned one or two new moves. Halfway through it I was having a lot of fun and improvising a little. While I've practiced with my veil, I haven't yet tried designing a choreography with it. Dolphina presents some good ideas on how to put the moves together.  The routine she presents is easy and fun.

I don't think this one would be too hard on beginners. Dolphina did a good job of demonstrating most of the moves but went a little fast. She skipped explaining undulations altogether, so if you have no experience be prepared to improvise during that part of the choreography. The beauty of video is that you can rewind and repeat as many times as you want. For beginners, I do recommend that you use a veil the length of the one that Dolphina uses. My three yard veil seemed a little long for the moves she was teaching. I thought that the photography was very good, showing the instructor's whole body throughout. I'm confused by some of the reviews on this and one of Dolphina's other DVD's that contradict each other on that issue. It makes one wonder whether the reviewer actually used or even watched the video.

As both a workout and bellydance lesson, it's very good.  Dolphina presents the basics in 30 minutes and the choreography is simple. I've been taking classes for about seven months. I buy DVD's to supplement the classes and to develop and perfect my skills. I'd rather choreograph my own routines than copy someone else's. Dolphina, Sonia and Jillina's videos have all helped me build the basics needed to design my own dance.

If you're just looking for a workout, this will tone your arms but doesn't pack enough cardio for fat burning. I found this DVD to be very relaxing and it works for stretching and stress release. If your goal is to learn bellydance, you'll get a good basic lesson on veil technique.",1147737600,,2024,4.501362397820164

7966923,4,B00006BHAG,"This video is simple yet effective.  Your arms will definitely feel the burn, but you won't mind because with the veil, it is fun!  Dolphina has a calm, soothing voice that makes her presentation very pleasant.  The workout proceeds at a perfect pace.  She leaves enough time to practice each move, but not too much time so that you don't get bored.  While not a huge number of veil techniques are presented, the ones that she does go over are staples of veilwork, and I have found them to be very useful in my dancing.  The length of the video is great--in the time you could watch a sitcom, you can tone your arms instead!  Time flies when you're having fun.  :)  I do not recommend this as a good DVD for technique instruction, because sometimes her demonstrations of the veil, hip, and footwork moves are neither clear nor consistent.  Having some prior exposure to bellydance and veilwork makes the video easier to follow.  That aside, as a workout video this accomplishes what it sets out to do.  It is a great buy for the money, and a video I will keep coming back to!",1131840000,,1075,4.456410256410257
7966924,3,B00006BHAG,"This is a nice video for working out your arms on days when you have only 25 minutes to spare.  The veil work can easily be done with a light scarf or cloth.  Dolphina includes a very brief routine towards the end.

The video includes a warm up, two veil technique sections, a routine and a cool down.  She shows you how to make an entrance with your veil, some moves that whirl the veil around, footwork to accompany the moves, turns and an arabesque.  She assumes that you already know how to do hip circles, hip drops, and shimmies.

I would recommend this video for people who are beginners who have some exposure to bellydance and want to add a few more steps to their workout or dance practice.",1126483200,,700,4.346153846153846
