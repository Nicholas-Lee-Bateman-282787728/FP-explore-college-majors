There are enough metaphors to keep the viewer captivated. You may find yourself sheepishly laughing aloud as you recognize pieces of yourself in these characters.

Pay special attention to the protagonist in  el cuco, look past the humor to the real man and see how vulnerable we all can be.

8175688,5,B000N8V4F4,"It's not often movies are so original they have you thinking about them weeks later. It's not often you find yourself even telling people about a movie that you know they will never see, sadly.
Tom Whalen is hilarious as the actor and writer of these films.
The thing I'm finding out is no matter how crass or obsene, Whalen is a teddy bear underneath and that's why his work comes across as so authentic.
As he drinks down beers and his eyes pop open wide at breasts, most of that isn't even acting! But him just expressing himself at his most base.
Originaly and wildly funny, not for kids, but great for a group of people that want to see what one really funny guy can do on film.",1228176000,,683,4.2615384615384615
8175689,3,B000N8V4F4,"Tom Whelan's screenplays may lack the sophistication of his books, The Dakapa Handbook and The Basilicata Manifesto, but there is still something special about them. His irrevent humor and over-the-top style is present throughout both films. And My African Unlce was even a selection of the Wildwood Film Festival.",1206921600,,314,5.428571428571429

8175691,5,B000N8V4F4,"The short films were so well written and acted they left me feeling like I knew the actors. I can only hope Frakish Intrigue continues to develop the talented writers, actors and director. I am looking forward to their next film.",1171670400,,229,4.609756097560975

8175693,4,B000N8V4F4,"IT WAS A BIG HIT WITH SOME OF THE YOUNGER PEOPLE IN THE MOSQUE. I FOR ONE WILL NOT BE JOINING MY FELLOW WARRIERS OF ALLAH IN THE RACE TO KILL TOM WHELAN AND DESTROY FREAKISH INTRIGUE , FATWA OR NOT. BTW NEXT WEEK WE ARE SHOWING LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE A CUTE LITTLE FILM.",1171324800,2,292,3.9661016949152543
8175694,5,B000N8V4F4,"Two character driven stories, technically sound, smart and clever. Both shorts, El Cuco and My African Uncle, are well written, acted and directed. Good fun. Check it out.",1171152000,3,171,5.142857142857143
