7964880,3,B000068TOT,"CONTENTS of MAFIA GREATEST HITS 4 Movie Pack:

ESCAPE FROM DEATH ROW-- Best here is this Euro-made crime film fronted by Lee Van Cleef. Two gangster inmates pool resources on a prison break so that one can reclaim territory stolen from him in his native France and the other might become a mob ""made"" man.

FAMILY ENFORCER-- Joe Pesci (in his first credited movie role) is third banana in this story of a New Jersey kid who takes a job as an enforcer/debt collector.

HIT LADY-- Scripted by Yvette Mimieux and directed by Ed Wynn's grandson, this ""Movie of the Week"" concerns a lovely artist who leads a double life as a contract killer. Good cast in a sanitized for television underworld story.

MOB WAR-- The ""Raging Bull"" (middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta) stars in this poorly executed indie film about a gangster who runs afoul of his Don (LaMotta) when he hires a publicity agent after a big cocaine deal gets busted up by NYPD.

7964881,1,B000068TOT,"Ok, so I'm into mafia type movies, and purchased this because it was only 10 bucks. The disk brings like 3 or 4 movies. They are all very low budget and poorly made movies. Some low-budget movies can still be very entertaining if they have a good story line - but not these. The movie with Joe Pesci is semi-entertaining, but not worth the money. Another film is some really whack type of documentary on some mobster. So anyway, the point is that you should not consider purchasing this DVD if you are looking for entertainment.",1046649600,33,528,4.510416666666667
