8763578,4,B01GUP5AC6,"This witty picture deals with a crucial moment that well deserves to be discussed. A crucial event when the driver of an ambulance has to surpass a single incident in the line of duty. That fatalistic detour will take us to the legal jungle and eventually to a point of no return.

Above the average. Go for it. It will leave you thinkin for a long long time. Recommended.
