8181603,4,B000NVI2CE,"This is a BBC documentary about Paris. It is a Region 2 DVD, meaning that it will not work on most American DVD players. However, there are video transfer labs that convert Region 2 DVD's to Region 1. I paid $30 for the process.

If there was a perfect woman then it would be Sandrine Voillet. She is so much more classy than that airhead Samantha Brown. She also has a sexy accent. However, that is a catch-22 since her accent makes her hard to understand at times. I couldn't understand half the things she was saying.

This DVD is divided into 3 one hour episodes. In the episode ""City of Dreams"", she visits the Louvre (home of the Mona Lisa), the Champs Elysses, Arc de Triomphe, and the Orsay Museum. The episode also features the July 14th Bastille Day celebration (for those of you who aren't familiar, that's a celebration of the anniversary of French Revolution. It features parades and fireworks).

In the episode ""Blood and Chocolate"", she rode a motorboat along the River Seine. She also visited the Notre Dame and interviewed a French rapper. This was the least interesting of the 3 episodes.

My favorite episode was the last episode, ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" It began with her riding a bike around Paris. She then rode the Paris Metro, which has beautiful stations. She also passed by the sex shops in Montmarte before catching a show at the Moulin Rouge. She said that the Moulin Rouge is essentially a tourist trap and that a real Parisian wouldn't be caught dead there.

Next, she interviewed Picasso's grandson before talking about the increasing immigrant population of Paris. Sandrine went to the Grand Mosque of Paris (she did not wear a hijab). It looked nice. She then went to an African restaurant. She mentioned that during the 1920's, many black American entertainers who faced discrimination went to Paris where they were accepted with open arms. As a black male, this made me proud.

Sandrine talked about World War II. During World War II, many French Jews were sent to Auschwitz. However, the Paris Resistance built tunnels to help them hide from the Nazis.

Later, she dispelled the myth about Paris only having rich areas and mentioned that there are poor slums where immigrants live. They're upset at their living conditions as well as unemployment. There was even a riot as recent as 2005 (the worst part of Paris still can't be as bad as the south Bronx).

To end her documentary on a positive note, she showed Parisians rollerblading and ice skating.

Overall, this was an enjoyable and informative documentary. However, I would not rely solely on this for planning a trip to Paris (if that's what you want to do, purchase Rick Steves France DVD and Blu-Ray 2014). This was more of a discussion about French culture than a trip planning guide. Nevertheless, I encourage people to purchase this DVD. If it's not available on Amazon, then it's likely available on Amazon UK (they accept American currency).",1385251200,2,2938,4.790513833992095

8181605,5,B000NVI2CE,"This documentary was shown on PBS in the States/ I loved it.  It is excellent shows so much about Paris from the time it was found it to the present time.  It is interesting, informative and a pleasure to learn so much about this beautiful city and its history.

Is there any way to obtain a copy for an american standard
