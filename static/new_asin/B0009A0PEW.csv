Seeing some of my favorite bands perform in this setting is brilliant. The first disc was great (episodes 1 and 2), and this one is every bit as good. It features The Arcade Fire doing ""Wake Up"", which by itself is worth getting the DVD, but there's a lot more. Like Henry Rollins battling a puppet named Rufus Leaking and The Firey Furnaces doing a song they wrote for the show called ""Mouse House, Moose Hoose"" (which features a sloppy but amazing dance). Add that with appearances by George Clinton and the Scissor Sisters and you've got a DVD unlike anything I've ever seen. Just like the first one, it defies the notion that kids have to listen to crappy homogenized music. I can't wait for the next DVD!",1113868800,2,752,4.371428571428571
