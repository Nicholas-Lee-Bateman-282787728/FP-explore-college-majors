3737652,1,B001P42YCW,"Bottomline, this movie was horrible!!  The media hyped out this movie because of the sexual assault scene on dakota fanning.  The scene is not graphic at all, and it is only like 1 minute.  This movie is about dakota as a young elvis fan in the 50's who finds joy in music and it helps her deal with her family problems.  They must have sang hounddog atleast 20 times in this movie.  It shows her tough life in the south and things she has to deal with, but the movie goes no where!!  It was boring and I found myself looking for other things to do.  Terrible movie.",1235692800,2,566,4.185185185185185
3737653,4,B001P42YCW,"About a pre-pubescent girl in the late 50's in the South who is thrilled about Elvis and gets the chance for a ticket to see him. But to retrieve the ticket, she falls into a compromising situation with the family's teen milk delivery boy. The rape scene is not as graphic as one might think.  I was a little nervous to watch it, but the directors were very cautious and appropriate. They do not side step or skirt the issue, but deal with it head on, which I think there is a need for this risk-taking in modern filmmaking to tackle issues such as child rape and abuse.  It was ethically done and not inappropriate.  She is only shown in her underwear and the rest is neck up views after it is suggested that she takes her clothes completely off, and then we see mainly views of her distraught face as she goes through the ordeal. The girl's father also shoots her dog for eating the chickens and then he is also struck by lightning, which actually makes him a better person and he stops abusing his girl. So then her religious and overzealous grandma becomes the primary caregiver, but doesn't empathize for her granddaughter, instead looks at her as a wretched sinner just as she does with the father, and especially, the girlfriend of the father.  The traumatized, depressed girl then finds refuge and redemption in an African American farm-hand/blues-singer who knows about oppression, misery, and sadness, but he uses those experiences to rise above and become a better person without using those experiences for his misery.  Playing the blues at night in a barn with his friends fills that empty hole in his spirit.  He becomes a strong positive role model to the saddened girl and coaches her to express with the blues in able to heal.  She eventually awakens and responsibly leaves both father and grandmother, because he can no longer relate to her situation due to his sustained injuries from the lightning strike (brain fried and childlike behavior) and her grandmother because she is much too over the top with her religion and doesn't empathize.  Both adult relatives remain ignorant and stay in misery, but the father is mostly blissfully unaware due to his condition. Child rape and abuse happens everyday and it's something we need put on the table openly and seriously address. The movie does that and also strongly shows the damages sexism can inflict upon a young girl.  In child rape and abuse cases, sexism makes matters even worse causing insult to injury. Girls can and will feel unnecessarily guilty and at fault for injuries sustained to them from other's malevolent actions due to sexism.  The film has redeeming qualities and deals with moral dilemmas of the human condition and spirit. A very sultry and muggy atmosphere is created, so we get a feel of the South in the summertime. Great aesthetics. Dakota is on her way to become a classic actress. Dakota is a very talented and brave young girl.  Bravo!  Great daring and moving filmmaking!",1235174400,6,2971,4.7587548638132295

3737678,4,B001P42YCW,"I'm afraid this film has been edited so much so that there is little left to recommend. Even reviews from previous Amazon reviewers mention parts that are sadly not in the rent to watch version. I also understand it was once banned and edited from it's original version before anyone in the general public was allowed to view it so I suggest people look elsewhere to watch Hound Dog or buy the DVD. Perhaps that version is left at least uncut from when it was first released. That said, I still give it four stars for the storyline and for atmosphere and accurate portrayal of what it was like to be a young teen growing up in the Deep South",1480896000,5,641,4.35

It was a scene required by the story and handled with real taste. I would have loved to have seen the cut scenes, as I felt something was missing. However, still a good movie.

Dakota Fanning does an outstanding job, her character was (I feel) true to the period in which the movie was set, her family was not affluent in the film follows her as she's growing up, living and playing in simple clothes and barefoot. It helps if you either love or hate the music of Elvis Presley! Her renditions of his signature song ""hound dog"" are precious and integral to the story line. She also learns some hard life lessons [spoiler alert] about betrayal by a friend, and the ugliness of physical assault upon her body. The rape scene is tough to take, though it's not graphic nor drawn out (they didn't milk it but we know what happened). This one has a permanent place in my collection.",1424822400,,727,4.6

A satisfactory ending, where some of the nasty individuals get their come-uppings and Lewellen (Fanning) seems to have a brighter future, but her terrible experiences will leave her disillusioned and distrustful for life. Dakota Fanning turned a milestone in her acting career, with this film, convincingly portraying this girl's unsettling series of events.

3737748,5,B001P42YCW,"Strangely, I had never heard of this film, until I came upon it doing a search for Southern Gothic films. After doing a lot of research, I have to wonder why there was so much controversy over it. I am glad the writer/producer held her ground and got the film out there.

Great cast, storyline, and it reminded me of growing up in the South. I grew up in the higher hills of West TN., and this is tame to the stories my grandmother used to tell me that were not acts, but truths.

When people protest a movie of this sort, there is more of a reason than you think. In the old south Incest was something that happened within some families. Incest within some families was a very real thing, shameful, but it happened. Would the public protest a movie about incest of a 12 year old?  I have no idea, but maybe the people who protested Kampmeier's movie ""doth protest too much,"" maybe he or she was reminded of another time. And perhaps it rang too close to home for some who were guilty in past.

Some outcries and protests against this film were ungrounded and done by people who hadn't even seen the movie. Filmed in Wilmington, NC., it was first shown to the DA, at that time. He deals with criminals all the time and found nothing wrong with this film and gave approval for the film.

If a person really wants to know how it was filmed, then google. You have to remember these are actors, and it's a script that's being read. They leave this one and go onto another script, and guess what? They forget all about it. I think some of the public did the writer/producer a great dis-service by bad mouthing this film when there was no reason--it costs money wise at the box-office too. As another commenter said, it would have done well to be shown on HBO. No problem there.

Outstanding cast, and I highly recommend this film.",1384646400,6,1825,4.352941176470588
3737749,4,B001P42YCW,I thought this movie was pretty good. The story was well-written and did a good job of depicting a little girl's experiences growing up in a lower-class neighborhood in the 1950's.,1382400000,,180,4.838709677419355
3737750,4,B001P42YCW,"I'm glad to see Dakota  has defended ""Hounddog"" and her role in it. The film, made in the summer of 2006 (Dakota was 12 1/2yo), brought an abrupt end to Dakota's child movies and proved her ability as a heavy-lift dramatic actress: her performance was extraordinary and is still my favorite.

Lewellen's (Dakota's character) ordeal was a beautifully done and emotionally moving scene -- mostly, I believe, shot in pieces and put together in editing. After the film festival showing in early 2007, the film got a lot of flack for what Dakota allegedly ""had to go through."" I'll never forget the words of the, not quite 13 year old, angry Dakota: ""...it's called acting."" She made it clear that the kids in the film ""...didn't go through anything."" As I recall, the actors refused to compromise and ended up working for union scale (because of funding problems)--refusing to cut the controversial scene.

What I find especially outrageous is that Dakota received no awards or even nominations for this film--IMO, a real injustice. (BTW, the performances of the adults in the film were also very very good.)

In the movie trailer at IMDb, we see this comment: ""Dakota Fanning gives an absolutely riveting performance, a triumph. ... the Hollywood Reporter."" This was a challenging role  for Dakota and she was very fortunate to get it. Performances like this will assure her future as a dramatic actress. She dove into the Lewellen character 100%.

The Lewellen character was not my favorite of Dakota's characters. I saw Lewellen as crude, delusional about her talent, and very naive--unnervingly naturalistic. This includes the opening scene; I've never seen anything like it on the screen, but I know, for a fact, that it's realistic. Dakota brought out the crudeness very well; there was no attempt to showcase any singing or dancing talent of Dakota--it was Lewellen all the way. In the same vein, I saw no attempt to sexualize Dakota or make her provocative.  Such an analysis would, IMO, be very superficial. Was Lewellen trying to be provocative? I don't think so; she was just very naive. We sympathize with Lewellen because of the ugly world made for her by her father and grammie. She desperately wants to get out and find something better. In this, she has a friend in the man who takes care of a neighbor's horses. He comes into play over and over again to save her-- both physically and mentally.

As for the movie itself, there is a plot-hole that hurts it a bit for me but others may not notice. In any case, the more I watch the film, the more I believe it was highly underrated. I give it 4.5 stars.",1377043200,3,2614,4.754966887417218

3737756,3,B001P42YCW,"I decided to watch this film based mostly on the fact that Isabelle Fuhrman had a role in it. I saw her incredible performance as the evil adopted child in the horror film Orphan and was interested in seeing her again. She has a very brief role and the script offers her nothing much to work with. Luckily I found Dakota Fanning's performance in War or the worlds very worthy and she also was worth taking notice. Its an amazing treat to watch child actors as they form their careers into lasting ones. Few get there, But some come to mind that have really blazed an impressive trail of solid and memorable performances. Jodie Foster, Linda Blair, Juliette Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio to name a few have become serious actors. Houndog is a film that truly gives Fanning the perfect opportunity to show just how good she really is. Her performance was brilliant. The story is slow and a rather sad and empty one. And its all the more painful to see the tragic and painful moments never really getting resolved. For example she has a chance to see Elvis Presley live in concert(who means the world to her) but is tricked into thinking shell get a ticket to see him if she removes her clothes and dances and sings for a local teenager. Instead she ends up getting raped for her effort and never gets the ticket. The person responsible is never punished for his crime and the problem is never really resolved by the end of the film. Her innocence is nearly stolen from her forever, but a local black blues singer in town helps her recover from her ordeal and then helps her find some meaning in her life through music and learning to let go of her pain and demoms. David Morse as her father is truly a tragic figure in the film. A decent man who just falls to pieces after he is struck by lightning. Over all this was an unusual and interesting story. But I felt short-changed because the perverted child molester who took her innocence is never given his due. But I did like this film very much.",1367884800,2,1989,4.4520547945205475
3737757,5,B001P42YCW,"[spoiler alert] From all the descriptions of the original theatrical release, I suspect this dvd version has been drastically cut, edited, and otherwise censored. The original was supposedly a very graphically portrayed (it's not real okay) rape scene. In this version, there's nothing there! No seriously, the teenage boy is maybe a foot and half taller than Dakota. However, while she's lying on the ground with him ""on top of her"", you can see her from at least the chest up ... but there's no guy on top (who should have been practically smothering her with his chest in her face). Hate to say it, but this weird ""invisible assailant"" technique makes it appear as though he's not doing anything other than obliging her with a little French love, if you know what I mean. Hardly believable in my opinion, as if the director went so far out of her way to tone down the dvd release that she destroyed all credibility of the assault.

Now that that's out of the way, a sincere, refreshing, honest, and arrestingly beautiful depiction of a very poverty stricken (i.e., strati-graphically divided along financial lines) South and very isolated (social, education, experience, etc.) little girl. Dakota is absolutely at the height of her powers in this arthouse gem. Sadly, this is the penultimate film in which we'll be able to treasure and adore her while she's still a real child (in her very next role, she'd already budded breasts and tons of ""teenage angst""). From Shirley Temple to Margaret O'Brien, from Drew Barrymore to Dakota ... they certainly grow up much too soon and thus deprive us of their fresh, unspoiled forms and outstanding, preternatural talents.

3737774,4,B001P42YCW,"Pretty depressing, but pretty compelling, too. Dakota Fanning plays Lewellen, the lead character, to perfection. Even if the movie were no good otherwise, I'd recommend it just to see how such a young actress can make you believe you're really in the middle of a story, seeing a real little girl in her real life. She raises protective instincts in most of the audience, and I don't want to think about what she raises in the rest.

Lewellen is 12 years old, lives with her father (David Morse) in a run-down house in a run-down part of the south; near Nashville, I think. Her mother is gone, but it is not clear where or why. Her maternal grandmother (Piper Laurie) lives nearby, and is a fundamentalist authoritarian who seems to be always angry, always saying no.

Lewellen loves to imitate Elvis, singing ""Hounddog"" with a floor lamp for a microphone, and all the hip movements. She is therefore shocked when her friend Charlie introduces her to Big Mama Thornton, who sang it ""all wrong,"" because Lewellen figured it was Elvis' song. But in fact Thornton had recorded it years before Elvis.

Lewellen says she can't sing the blues because she isn't black. Charlie explains that singing the blues isn't just for black folks, and cites Elvis as an example. Hounddog thus becomes a symbol of Lewellen's emotional development, when she can sing from the heart and not merely from imitation.

But the story is not primarily about music. It's about the vulnerability of a young girl to injustice, to the demands and whims of adults, and even of older children. But it's also about her inner strength, her sense of responsibility in caring for her father after he is struck by lightening and ""turned stupid,"" as her friend's father put it. Believe me, he was not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree before the lightning hit his tractor.

The dynamics of the family life, and facts about the past unfold slowly, and I'm not going to spoil those revelations for you. But I do have one nagging question. Early in the story, Daddy has a Stranger Lady move in for awhile. The credits list this as Robin Wright Penn. Later we get to know another lady who is perhaps Lewellen's mother or her aunt; in any case, the daughter Grannie rejected. She looks a lot like Stranger Lady, but I'm not sure. There is some critical information in knowing this, and it bothers me that I am not good enough at recognizing and remembering faces to be sure. Anyone know?",1336780800,2,2449,4.672853828306264

This movie had nothing to do with its implications. This little girl was not a sex fiend/addict in any way.
She was sweet and caring.

Those reviews must have been written by a woman hating creep. Ya know the type, She got what she deserved type of mentality.

In-fact, it was a very good movie and totally worth watching again.

I was somewhat difficult to watch this pretty skinny little girl performing her Elvis routine. I actually preferred to look away for those parts.

Another problem I had was seeing the older teenager, completely covered with acne. It was very disgusting and left me wondering as to why no adult back then didn't teach the kid how to fix such a thing.

So, there is no ""sex"" scenes"" in this movie. Just a hidden Rape scene.

Her friends include a neighbor boy and a wonderfully lively group of southern blacks, whom she accompanies as an elvis singer.  It is warm and she is evidently going to become an extraordinary beauty.

However, she is introduced to sex at too early an age.  This is not, as some reviewers have claimed, about early sexuality - there is nothing titillating about it whatsoever.  Indeed, completely unprepared, the theme of the story is that it nearly breaks her spirit.  It is about the possibility of healing and it is extremely, graphically realistic.

Those who are commenting that the movie is dumb because it teaches that if you get raped just sing a song, are missing the point entirely.

3737789,4,B001P42YCW,"it's in statistical data that at least 1 out of 4 girls will be sexually abused before they reach the age of 18

the movie itself is built upon that one scene; I believe that this is due to one of the producer/director/writer's experience however this is a great setting since it would be quite commonplace for a girl growing up in poverty in such a time.

Elvis was seen as sexual unbeknown est to Lewellen; she probably had no idea what it was all supposed to mean but because he was famous as a great singer and people talked about him she idolized him. I mean the scene where she talks to her friend about seeing his trouser snake is common sexual exploration found in adolescents, but did not signify that she was promiscuous.
There's no other hint that she is

If you do remember Robin Wright Penn, she was in the movie Forrest Gump as Jenny, the other poverty stricken southern girl who suffered abuse as a young girl by her father. It is my strongest belief that her contribution to the movie was essential and that Robin was the first chosen to play her part in this 'Hounddog'.

But the focus is about her dealing with all of her hardships, her father becomes disabled in a hurry, sounds a bit like, ""I am Sam"". With that being in mind, the movie could've used more length. It is certain that if put into a saga or in a series this movie would be more successful. It was a bit abrupt and just strewn all together hastily.
The conflicts are more complex and are more time consuming in reality to adjust; this movie is only somewhat realistic, still fits the bill of a Hollywood made movie.

3737792,3,B001P42YCW,"""Hounddog"" is a fairly predictable period piece about a young girl growing up in the rural south in the 1950's.  Dakota Fanning is impressive as a 12-year-old obsessed with Elvis Presley, and the supporting cast (David Morse as her womanizing father, Robin Wright Penn as her would-be mother, and Piper Laurie as her tipsy grandmother) is fine as well.  I'm not sure what all the fuss was about - there's nothing particularly controversial about this film.  Yes, there's a rape scene - but nothing shown in this film couldn't be shown on network television during prime-time.  Compare this to the harrowing (and deservedly controversial) ""Bastard out of Carolina"" and you'll see what I mean - both films are set in the same time period, with similar characters and circumstances.  But while ""Hounddog"" offers up clichs as answers, ""Bastard"" forces its audience to confront the realities of poverty, child abuse, and rape.

The problem with ""Hounddog"" isn't that it stretches the boundaries of morality and good taste - it's that the film itself is so derivative.  It feels like an odd mix of ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ""Fried Green Tomatoes,"" and ""Carrie"" - lots of nice scenes of dirt-poor kids bonding in swimming holes and corn fields with a little holy-roller craziness thrown in for good measure (Piper Laurie's character seems cut from the same cloth as her role as Sissy Spacek's mother in ""Carrie"").  This is a pretty film, with lovely country vistas and a nice hazy nostalgic quality that can be captivating on its own.  But there's nothing new here - just about everything that happens is predictable, including the final scene.  And all the snake symbolism is way, way overdone (I get it, I get it - ""stay out of the tall grass"").

This is not a bad film, and it is worth seeing.  It is not, however, worth getting worked up over.  If you don't like ""Hounddog"" it won't be because it sexually exploits children.  It does not.  It just tries to present a picture of what it would be like to grow up poor and alone in a world that doesn't offer much support.  This movie is not about sex; it's about loneliness.

She sings Hounddog many times in the film so now the song is stuck in my head for eternity. I think this is the first time, Dakota does a rape scene and I say she pulled it off really well. You can tell she's a great actress and is not afraid to go certain areas. I know some people were anal about the scene and i wasn't wild about it, but if you going to watch a film, you have to be open-minded about what you see and just enjoy the film as a whole.

I truly don't understand some of the negative reviews; the ""underwear scenes"" were not in the least bit revealing, unless you consider Mormon underwear erotic (and I live in Utah). There were NO scenes that showed Ms. Fanning in her underwear that were not germane to the story, and even in those circumstances, you will not find them to be the least bit erotic unless you are helplessly and hopelessly attracted to baggy cotton undies. Truly, if those reviewers who found this to be be erotic ACTUALLY WATCHED this film, my recommendation to them would be to lock their doors and avoid ANY of the following: Sears catalogs, Macy's advertisements, WalMart flyers, etc. They will quite possibly find National Geographic to be fatally sexual. Now for the film. This was a beautiful depiction of poverty in the deep south (but it could have been anywhere) and it's affect on those who must live with it. Piper Laurie seems almost to have reprised her CARRIE role as a Bible thumping caretaker, placing her religious beliefs over her acceptance of her daughter. Dakota is a young girl who finds music, specifically Elvis, to be her escape from her life. She is betrayed by her best friend and ends up in a situation that she neither asks for nor can control as she tries to get tickets to an Elvis concert that she wants to attend. The ""horrific"" rape scene that has upset some shows a closeup of Dakota Fanning's head and hand.... nothing more. The scene is truly horrific, however, as it occurs in real life more often than we would like to admit. The ramifications for Dakota and others are depicted in their brutal detail, and the ending is both tragic and hopeful. The symbolism of snakes and the role of African-Americans in the film may be a bit over the top and stereotypical, but not so much as to be distracting. I would have liked to have seen more of the reactions of some of the supporting characters, but there is a limit to what you can do in the time allotted.

Being naked was not that big a deal out in the hot sun, and she took her clothes off as if it was no big deal. I like the Blues singing scenes. They managed to put the ""sensitive Black man"" motif in there who ""protects"" Dakota's character. You have to have studied Black Film to get what thats about.

Disturbingly realistic on the racial differences, poverty issues and the vast difference between the privileged wealthy keeping up appearances and the poverty trapped individuals trying to merely survive. Dakota is amazing - as was her character in the movie.  The rape scene was most disturbing - mainly in the fact that as a survivor of same, it was horrific to watch - even though a movie - very real and happening to young girls in her character's situation to this day. To see her trust and innocense taken away so violently was sickening - but real. That scene had little to do with sexuality - only her enthusiasm for Elvis pelvis music and her soul connecting with the music had to do with her sexuality.  The rape - was/is a violent crime of POWER and CONTROL aganinst the body and spirit.  The most amazing part of the movie was the healing power of her black friend that played the blues - he was awesome.  I was fortunate enough to have some black people in my life that helped raise me and gave me more exposure to soul than my white family. I cried and cheered at the scene where he lifted her depleted little body wrought with the evil attack on her and lifted her up physically and brought her lifeless body to wail out that deep lifesucking angst out with song. He was pure soul - thank god for the revival of the spirit. People/Life/poverty/circumstance can beat you down to no end - but the spirit can rise above the worst kinds of circumstance and violence against the self.  Dakota was off the chart amazing in her character in this film. In spite of the horrible circumstances life dealt her, she was a loyal and obedient daughter and granddaughter - unlike most juvenile delinquents running around today. She held on to her comittments until she had enough of the killing of her spirit - and finally chose Life.  Absolutely powerful.",1272412800,19,1925,4.546242774566474

It put me back in a time of my  life that was both refreshing and disturbing. Heres the the problem for me.
They banned this movie in the USA from playing. Which is one of the reasons I wanted to see it. I wanted to see what was the big deal. Art imitates life. So I watched, and I watched and the things that I saw, that could have been the reason for it not showing were implied at best. Thats what I didn't get. Even what could have been the most problematic parts of this presentation were implied!
I don't get the industry. They allow other things to be shown literally (ie.. ""Broke Back Mountain"", ""Y tu mama tambien"" etc.) Yet they ban this over what they implied and didn't even show.
I feel this was an attempt to protect Dakota Fanning at all cost. Which for that reason because we all have watched her grow up I can accept. Was the eveidence there? No. Is what they implied in the movie serious? Very. Would I have paid to go see it? No. This movie should have been on HBO or Showtime based on the story which was hollow, but the Box office?

How many 12-year-old girls can carry the principal role in a movie, without being upstaged by the likes of Piper Laurie, David Morse, Robin Wright Penn and Afemo Omilanmi? This movie has all of the ingredients of one that you will love. The story line is deep and complex, and Penn turns in a tight performance as a woman with a troubled past, who feels a strong emotional connection with Lewellen. The unqualified star of the show, however, is Fanning, whose portrayal of a young girl on the cusp of exploring her sexuality, and struggling to understand her place in the world, is nothing short of stunning. The context provided by the south of the 1950s dishes up some great explorations of racial undertones and incestuous subplots. Morse, always reliable, is convincing as a tyrant, of course, but also as a physically and mentally compromised parent.

The controversy has died down over one stupid rape scene and now we can watch a movie. So because this movie has DF taking on a more mature role, it's automatically a good movie, right? Wrong.

THis movie was ridiculous. It's thinly veiled child porn at its most obvious.

About the rape, it's NOWHERE NEAR as bad as what everyone's making it out to be. It just felt thrown in there to shock the audience. It's discussed in talks, as for the actual rape scene itself is ridiculous. It's NOT AS BAD AS EVERYONE'S SAYING. It's like 12 seconds long. You see her face and hand in closeup.

Even more so about the rape, what follows is just ridiculous. She pretty much becomes a zombie. I've seen movies where people DF's age where they go through worse and they don't act as bad as she does. And ""Elvis' music is evil""? Weird.

Seriously, there's not a single memorable moment in this. It's just thinly veiled child porn. Avoid.

Oh, and I am completely disgusted with the director and her agent. After the rating fell into the 5 zone on IMDb, and almost all the reviews began commenting on the same negative attributes, all of a sudden the review page is filled with 10 star reviews with the same comments. SHame on the director for not letting a product stand on its own, and even further, shame on her for telling her audience that their opinions are as worth as much cheaply bought plastic.",1250467200,8,1537,4.41696113074205

3737830,2,B001P42YCW,"Curiosity got the best of me and I finally saw this controversial film on DVD in late July of 2009.  The controversy centered around a rape scene and whether an 12-year-old girl should be acting out scenes like that. Well, when you're Dakota Fanning and your parents have already placed you in R-rated movies beginning at the age of seven or eight, I guess this is no big deal to them.

Actually, I thought the story was interesting - not boring; the acting decent (Fanning is always good), and the photography good. What I found objectionable were way too many scenes with the thin 12-year-old (when the movie was made) Fanning  in just her underwear, with a lot of closeup shots of her groin area.

Man, how stupid can filmmakers be? This must be a favorite film of pedophiles. In this day-and-age (or any age, for that matter), do you really think it's a good idea to do that? Director/writer Deborah Kampmeier, apparently sees nothing wrong with it, along with having the young girl walking around with her totally naked dad, played by David Morse.

Also, if you read discussions on the film from people who saw the movie at the theater, there were several more very shocking scenes that were not even in this DVD version.

Kampmeier is an example of liberal extremism run amok. She sees this all as ""sexually liberating"" women from an early age. That  the woman talks about at length on the interview part of the DVD. She also likes to bash Christianity. It figures.

In an era of Internet child porn, is it any wonder few theaters would show this movie, and that many people walked out of the theaters during screenings of this film (which were far more explicit than what's on the DVD)? The only thing is, all the editing that took place for the DVD, it made the story way too confusing with no answers on several key issues. Overall, it turns out to be a mess of a film.",1248912000,10,1878,4.519174041297935
3737831,4,B001P42YCW,"In case you are not aware, this film was slammed down really hard by the professional critics in general, earning something like %16 on rotten tomatoes (that's a really, really poor rating). The reason behind this immediate outrage against the film is quite obvious: we live in a society that is overly paranoid about childhood sexuality - the most taboo of all topics. This film isn't the least bit afraid to portray a 12 year old girl who is blooming sexually and exploring the power and creativity of (as well as learning the horrible dangers of) her sexuality. The fact that said girl is America's beloved, sweet Dakota Fanning only made the pill all the more bitter for the critics to swallow.

If you ask me, Fanning's character is amazingly realistic. Wake-up-call to the world: girls don't suddenly become sexual at 18! Of course a 12 year old can be curious, of course a 12 year old can be sexy. The fact that Dakota is walking around in her panties throughout most the film is realistic too, at least it would have been during that era in the poverty-stricken deep south, as are many other details in this movie, like the way the adults don't take issue with a 12-year-old taking a sip of beer or puffing a cig. And moreover, if you see a girl playing in her panties and it bothers you so much, I think it says more about your own sexual issues than the movie's.

The movie has a beautiful message about art through suffering. But it also has many other themes, among them childhood innocence and gender roles. I think even the harshest critic will agree that Dakota does an amazing job (she really just might be the greatest child actor of all time). Above all I enjoyed the film's beautiful cinematography & color palate - calm blues and soft browns and dusty yellows throughout.

3737849,4,B001P42YCW,"There is a lot of so-called ""misunderstanding"" of this film out there. I see both sides. Sure, Dakota gave a courageous, stunning performance considering the heaviness of her role in this movie. And I'm a big Elvis and blues music fan, so I really dug the music end of this movie. The gospel singing of the song during the end credits is the best singing you will ever hear! I wish I could buy the soundtrack.

OK, back to my point...as far as Dakota herself is concerned, I do think she is mature beyond her years enough to be able to have withstood this kind of disturbing turn of events to act out without affecting her emotionally. Strong parenting and a healthy understanding of this kind of violence should help with that. She's young, but still she's a professional actress. But I do not recommend this movie to be shown to young viewers. There is no need for them to be exposed to such material at a young age.

Also, I don't get the director's defense of the disturbing scenes. In the bonus feature interview, she says that religion ""represses"" a young girl's sexuality that should be ""celebrated"" or ""explored"" or something to that extent. Well, DUH! The rape scene is a perfect example of why a young girl shouldn't outwardly express her sexuality, isn't it? Look what can happen! Perhaps she meant that a girl should be freer in that way and that all men and adolescent boys should respect that instead of getting turned on by it and reacting in violence. If that's what she meant, then that's a noble wish, but highly unrealistic, of course. I just thought that was quite an ironic defense of the sexuality-related scenes in this movie.

The cinematography is great in this movie, and gives a real ""down home"" feel of how it was down in the south in the 1950's. A well made movie. Kind of slow in the action department in between the violent scenes, but gets you pondering over it after it's over.",1242604800,4,1910,4.546511627906977

Dakota is very daring, very matured young lady, she gives a very smart performence, I have really started to adore her. Her chemistry with her father (played by David Morse) in the film is excellent.

I consider myself to own the DVD. Definately worth a watch.",1242259200,131,1024,4.446808510638298
3737852,5,B001P42YCW,"It's really sad that this movie is misinterpreted purely as a movie about rape.  The rape scene didn't even include actors touching. It was an amazing, beautiful and heart wrenching movie with incredible vulnerable performances! 3 out of 5 girls will suffer some form of sexual abuse before the age of 18. Close minded idiots like you Michael Elliano is what made this movie get banned from showing in theaters. There are far more graphic rape scenes that are in films these days like idiotic ""Watchmen"" that seemed to be ok only because they are lame Blockbusters intended for people obviously with no intellectual capacity to understand what a good movie is suppose to be.
Female sexuality should be celebrated and encouraged. Dakota delivered an outstanding performance. She's wiser beyond her years and I'm sure her parents would not let her participate in anything she did not understand or wasn't comfortable doing. The only disgusting part of this movie is Michael's review of it. Why don't you go see ""Knowing"". It's moronic and made for people with no active brain cells. Right up your alley Mr. Elliano.",1239321600,13,1113,4.951871657754011
3737853,5,B001P42YCW,"Cast includes: Dakota as Louellen, Piper Laurie as Gramma, David Morse as Daddy, and Robin Wright (Penn) as the girlfriend. Louellen longs to go to the Elvis concert coming to town but has no money; Gramma fusses over her but fills her with her idea of sinfulness (mostly about her Dad) and to stay away from boys and their sinful ways. Piper does excellent work in this role. Morse is perfect as the rough, crude but loving Dad. He is struck by lightning and Louellen must take care of him. They live in a shack in a Southern forest where she plays & swims with her friend as they explore their childish sexual feelings (show me yours and I'll give you a kiss...). Her black friend helps her understand her family and life and blues music. Excellent performances by everyone.",1238198400,9,776,4.55
3737854,5,B001P42YCW,"I just watched this movie on DVD with the idea that most movies made about the Southern states are always depressing, with weird situations, and abusive parents. This movies starts out with Dakota Fanning's character, Lou-Ellen, running through the woods barefoot, with loose fitting homemade dress on. She meets up with a boy about 10 years old that she considers one of her best friends. While they are playing in an abandoned shed, she asks the little boy to show her his privates, tempting him with a kiss if he shows her. He reluctantly shows her, just so he can get a kiss from her, and the movie goes on from there. Lou-Ellen's father is a hard worker on their propery, they are poor, and he's sleeping with his sister-in-law (his wife is dead), who he is always beating on. Also, Lou-Ellen has a Grandmother, who treats her mean, always accusing her of being a sinner. To escape the pressures of life, Lou-Ellen listens to Elvis Presley music and loves the song ""Hounddog"". She makes quite the impression on her friends while singing the song herself, and imatating Elvis. The movie goes on while Lou-Ellen plays with her little friend in the creek to cool off, and plays with snakes in the grass. While her little male friend tells her he can get her tickets to an Elvis concert, she gets so excited, and dances and sings all day long. When her little friend comes to get her and tells her the tickets came in, she meets him in the abandoned shed to get the tickets from him. While in the shed, a young man holds the tickets in his hand tempting her, while she smiles from ear to ear excitedly. She realizes that he's the guy who delivers milk to her home weekly. He holds the tickets in his hand, and asks her to sing ""Hounddog"", and claims that he heard she can sing it well. She starts to sing, and he asks her to dance like Elvis too. Upon her dancing, the little boy says ""Not like that!"" He whispers in her ear, ""I made a deal, you have to take your clothes off"". She does, but the young man wants her to sing naked. She takes all her clothes off (But nothing is shown, photography is from the neck up), and starts to sing and dance. All while this is going on, she is begging for her Elvis tickets. Then it happens, the young milkman rapes her leaving her alone, while the little boy stares at her scared. He too, leaves her alone and she is left by herself in the shed, without any Elvis tickets, scared,  betrayed, and viotated. The next morning, she sleeps in an abandoned car, afraid to tell anyone, or to go home. This movie was well made, without showing what was going on, only that you could see the expressions of fear and betrayal on Lou-Ellen's face while being raped, and betrayed by her best friend, this movie showed how people feel when such a crime happens, and fear, and shame of telling someone else. How someone can get away with such a crime, when the victim won't stand up for themselves. I don't know why people are afraid of this movie. No nudity is shown, it's left to your imagination. I am hoping that this movie will make people speak up when something such as this happens to them. I won't tell you the rest of the movie, or how it ends, I don't want to spoil it for you. This movie left me feeling sorry for Lou-Ellen, being only 12 years old, and alone. I was depressed, and I didn't like the ending at all. It just left you wondering about too many things. The overall movie was interesting, but the ending wasn't much to write home about.",1236729600,,3486,4.37962962962963
3737855,3,B001P42YCW,"I like this film. The ambiance and period settings were done exquisitely. Dakota Fanning is awesome in her role. I agree with one of the other reviewers that she seems to sing Hounddog too many times. What really bothers me is that I think the film might very well have been much better with a lot more emotional impact had the rape scene not been re cut to satisfy the puritanical supremest morons who feel a need to impose their will and morality on everyone else in the world.

We know the directer was forced to re cut the film and tone down the rape scene. Obviously the theatrically released version of the film is not the film she made. This is a crime.

I am hoping the director will one day release a director's cut of the film as she sees fit, beyond all restriction, so that we can fairly judge her work outside dictatorial censorship.",1236470400,,846,4.382165605095541
3737856,4,B001P42YCW,"Deborah Kampmeier has written and directed an atmospheric film about life in the South (Alabama to be specific) in the 1950s, using this confused period of time to examine how a child can rise out of her squalid surroundings, replacing her disappointments in expectations of family, friends, and trauma with tenuous grip on the dream of becoming a performer like her idol Elvis Presley.

Fortunate for Kampmeier she cast the rather amazing young Dakota Fanning to inhabit the role of the feisty but abused Lewellen, a headstrong prepubescent girl whose mother deserted her at birth, leaving her to live with her abusive lothario, worthless father (David Morse) whose current paramour is his ex-wife's sister (Robin Wright Penn) who leaves Lewellen also when the father's abuse and desertion overwhelm.  Lewellen's sole friend is young Buddy (Cody Sanford) who shares show and tell games with Lewellen until a promise to find tickets for an Elvis Presley concert includes a 'favor' for Buddy's older friend (the rape sequence that is germinal to the film and all the more powerful for its lack of graphic detail).  Lewellen's life crumbles: even her Bible thumping grandmother (Piper Laurie) can't console her, her only support comes form her old African American friend (Afemo Omilami) who is Lewellen's sole visionary source for Lewellen's gift for music and soul jazz.  Some change comes when Lewellen's father is struck by lightning, ending his career of philandering and making him dependent on Lewellen for all his needs.  How Lewellen rises out of all of this stagnation and arrives at an important life change forms the resolution to this story.

There is not a lot that is novel about this film, but the flavor of the missing connections is improved by the general feeling of the Southern situation in the 50s well captured by the camera work and the music.  Dakota Fanning continues to show a remarkable degree of depth in her talent as an actress.  Watching the film for her performance alone is worth the time.

She utilizes every aspect of herself to embody the character. Supporting actors and actresses were full dimensional.  Cinematography fits the mood of the story.

8332009,5,B001P42YCW,Really good movie. I am surprised I did not notice it when it came out. Dakota's voice is raw and sounds untrained but it is moving none-the-less and appropriate to the setting of the movie. I thought she gave an outstanding performance of a young girl whose innocence was lost on so many levels but she manages to hold onto her soul despite it all. Not sure what the controversy was about when it was released. It addresses dark themes but no more than many movies out there today and with much more depth.,1504915200,,507,4.404255319148936
