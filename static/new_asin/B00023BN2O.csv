2059065,3,B00023BN2O,". . . a super soundtrack that has haunted me for years and the stunning views of the Iranian desert. I saw this movie back in the early 80s and managed to tape it the next time it came on--and that was the last I heard of it. I'd watch my ""edited for TV"" tape every so often and have nagging memories of what was left out. I do like this movie. True, Jennifer O'Neill is totally  incongruous amongst the nomads, but hey, it's a movie. I am glad it's finally available on DVD, but the film quality is poor. One of the extras is the sountrack--and that makes it worth the purchase. On a side note, when I first saw the film, I went and read Michener's novel. I didn't like Ellen as well, but the cultural and historical aspects I picked up on Afghanistan have served me well these past 25 yrs.",1139097600,11,791,4.136363636363637
2059066,3,B00023BN2O,"A great film with one of the best soundtracks ever written. I was eagerly yearning for this DVD to be released, but I am now very, very disappointed: The DVD is definitely not digitally remasted"" as stated on the cover, but it obvoiusly seems to be a very poor transcription from a rental-VHS-tape which has been viewed dozens of times. Both the picture and sound quality are miserable. It is really a pity that this great movie is treated that way. I hope that another company will re-release it in proper quality.",1097971200,20,515,4.608695652173913
2059067,3,B00023BN2O,"I bought this movie having never seen it before.  My father purchased the sound track album in the early 80s and my whole family flipped over this sound track.  The sound track is one of the best sound tracks I have ever heard.  It is very moving.  I was in my early twenties when I fell in love with this sound track and now in my fortys, I still crank the volume for the caravan theme song.  I had heard the movie was not very good even though it has a lot of big names.  In my opinion the movie lacks passion.  You do not feel the passion that the missing wife has for the life she is now leading and never understand why she left her husband or even married him.  You do not feel the love that any man has for her and three men are in love with her.  The only thing and it's a BIG plus is that the movie comes with the soundtrack.  The sound track is worth every bit of the cost of the movie.",1091318400,13,896,3.9005524861878453
2059068,5,B00023BN2O,"I was a teacher in Iran when this movie was being filmed there in 1977.  Although the country mentioned in the film was a fictional place, I think the actual place in the Michner novel was Afghanistan or thereabouts.  However, most of this film was made on location in the Esfahan area of Iran.  The scenery is really beautiful, and although the movie time era is supposed to be the 40's, what you see in the film was typical of what you saw there in 1977, and most likely typical of today as well.  It's a good and enjoyable story, somewhat whimsical, but still very enjoyable, especially if you have an interest in the Middle East, Iran in particular.  Jennifer O'Neill plays the runaway diplomat's daughter, Anthony Quinn is the crusty, wise, much older tribal leader she supposedly runs away with (although there doesn't seem to be an actual romantic connection with them), Michael Sarrazin (who was a bit of a heartthrob circa 1977) is the young diplomat sent into the desert to find her and convince her to come home, and Anthony's son Duncan Quinn plays the role of Quinn's son.  Many of the tribal people you see in the film are actual Qashqai tribal members who were living in their tents around the Esfanhan area and who migrate around the area just like the tribe in the film, so they are  the real thing and most of them are not actors. The film's background music is good, too.  This film was a big deal when I was there in Iran, and as I recall the film was some sort of a project which had the late Shah's sponsorship...I believe he was trying to jump start the film industry in Iran at the time.  The Iranian actor who played O'Neill's Iranian husband was at the time one of Iran's biggest actors.",1072915200,32,1713,4.464743589743589
2059069,1,B00023BN2O,I have watched the movie on Netflix and it was superb quality. And the music by bratt was amazing .  The DVD I received was awful .  It doesn't even deserve a star .  The distributor should find out where Netflix got there copy.,1431907200,,228,4.136363636363637

2059071,3,B00023BN2O,"This film does not do the novel justice whatsoever--it's done in old time movie making style and misses the mark all around..  It would be great if today's film makers would take it on as a revival. Caravans, the novel, is  wonderful; this film is NOT.",1422403200,,252,4.456521739130435

2059073,3,B00023BN2O,Great movie. Unfortunately the quality of the DVD was dreadful.  Very dark most of the time.  That is unforgivable because the scenery and the costumes are overwhelming.  The music score is fantastic.s,1418688000,,201,5.21875

2059076,5,B00023BN2O,"A gem of a movie. James Michener classic book made into a great movie. Small sections have not transferred to DVD well. That is to be expected given age of the film print. Sound track is hauntingly beautiful. Well acted by an excellent cast, including Christopher Lee!",1410393600,,268,4.723404255319149
2059077,1,B00023BN2O,"I won't judge the movie itself, it is a piece of Iranian movie history having been filmed in Iran and including many of Iran's famous TV and film actors. If you liked 'the kite runner', you might like this one - though it is a less effective story.

The problem is the DVD quality sucks horribly. It is a 4:3 copy off either a VHS or some other terrible source. Netflix has this film on its streaming service and it is in very high, HD quality and I thought this would be the same, though in SD. It's not. So save your money until a new copy or blu-ray is available or watch it on Netflix.",1389052800,,589,4.077586206896552

2059079,5,B00023BN2O,"I have only just finished viewing Caravans.  I read the troubles some people had with their movies.  It did put me off for a couple of weeks, but in the end decided to purchase.  I enjoyed the movie and there were no jumps or breaks in my picture and the sound was just fine.  I watched this movie years ago on TV.  Came across it on the Amazon site.  Originally it was the music I was after.  I found the CD on the Amazon site and purchased.  Music was so great I decided to purchase the movie as well.  I was not disappointed in the movie at all.  It is not a fast trotting movie but it is certainly great viewing.  You can not gone terribly wrong with a movie with the fantastic music score popping up through as your watching.",1381795200,2,730,4.1063829787234045
2059080,3,B00023BN2O,"We were very disappointed with the  quality of the tape both picture & sound.
It is a wonderful movie and the music from it is fantastic but...
Is there a soundtrack only that is also available?
Many thanks

2059081,2,B00023BN2O,I watched this film and it was broken through out the middle part of the film. I do believe that this was a copy of another film.,1371081600,,129,3.814814814814815
2059082,1,B00023BN2O,"DISAPPOINTING...I was looking forward to watching this movie. But after just 3 minutes of trying to watch it, i had to remove it from my DVD player, and never to be put back in there again. The quality of the picture was very poor. I was hardly able to see any kind of picture at all. SHAME...SHAME...SHAME.  If i had read some of the reviews about this film, befor i went ahead and purchased it, then i would, have found out about the poor picture quality, As someone was bound to have mentioned that. But i saw this movie in the 1980s on television, and rememberd it well, so felt i didn't need to read up reviews on it. I saw a lovely clear picture when i saw it on TV. Now that its been put on to DVD the picture quality is shocking.  Buyers Beware.",1348358400,2,753,4.1506849315068495
2059083,4,B00023BN2O,"I will be buying this DVD because I accidentally re-taped something else over the first part.  Another commenter says Jennifer O'neill wandering around doesn't look appropriate. But she's playing an AMERICAN who chooses to be a nomad, and who expects her to be an Afghan?  I hated the end, but the music sounds like Mexican fiesta music set incongruously in Afghanistan, yet somehow it fits.  She was out of place there as a national as is the music, and it became appropriate.  It sounds like ""Have you ever ever ever loved a Woman?"" yet it works. I am not sure if the DVD will be of good quality or not but it will be playable, and anything with Quinn in it is good enough for me.",1285718400,,682,4.388888888888889
2059084,4,B00023BN2O,"It has a great soundtrack. A digitally remastered version should be created. There are very relevant themes from the 1970s in this film. The heroine Ellen is a woman who has to make great sacrifices to achieve her own freedom of spirit. The men in her life are a mixed bag of tricks. Her chosen lifestyle to live with nomads is a very ""hippy"" theme. I love it.",1252281600,,360,4.3088235294117645
2059085,2,B00023BN2O,"I watched the movie because I read the book and listened to the soundtrack since I was a kid.  But the editing is some of the worst I've ever seen.  They used a butcher's knife to edit this movie.  Scenes cut in and out at the wost places - the theme soundtrack cuts in abrubtly and ends just as abtrubtly.  The movie lacks passion or the sense and feel that it deserves.  Watch it if you must, but you'll probably be disappointed just as I was.",1244851200,,445,4.127906976744186
2059086,3,B00023BN2O,"I've always had a soft spot for this movie, which was filmed mostly in and around Esfahan, Iran in 1977 while I was living and working there.  The script unfortunately doesn't do justice to Michner's novel, but the scenery is beautiful and Mike Batt's soundtrack is exceptional.  Some of the acting is truly awful and borderline embarrasssing (particularly Joseph Cotten and Michael Sarrazin).  All this said, I confess to loving this movie as in many ways it is a trip down memory lane for me.  I orginally recorded the film from TV onto VHS tape about 15 years ago and was glad to see it finally out on DVD....although the DVD quality is poor, unfortunately.  I wish there had been some extra features on the DVD as well.",1202515200,3,723,4.6171875
2059087,1,B00023BN2O,"I heart a lot of bad things about this film but was happy to have it finally 30 years after I first heart the fantastic soundtrack by Mike Batt. And that's one plus of the DVD, you get the soundtrack as a bonus. Well the film itself is as bad as expected (worst performances, uninspired direction), so no surprise on that. But the technical standard tops it all. My first impression was it's an illegal copy, picture and sound are as taken from a very very old VHS-tape, no digital remastering (as it says on the cover) for sure. Unbelievable, making (legal!) copies of my old VHS-tapes myself gives better results than that. So beware - it's a chance to have the film but the technical quality is a mess!",1193184000,7,705,4.430769230769231
2059088,3,B00023BN2O,"Having waited over 25 years to finally see this film I must say that I have ended up with rather mixed feelings! A mediocre script does little justice to the deep and emotive themes in Michener's stunning novel. The author's empathy for the people of Afghanistan, his appreciation for the societal and political conflicts within post World War 2 Middle East and his understanding of the complexities of the rebellious young spirit are regrettably lost in this screen adaptation of the book.  However, the movie is definitely worth seeing for probably one of the best musical scores ever, some great views of the Iranian desert and a sterling performance from Anthony Quinn.",1152921600,7,673,5.008928571428571
8021363,1,B00023BN2O,Beware! Very bad quality. Looks like an amateur copy.,1523664000,,53,5.0
8021364,3,B00023BN2O,"The screen take did not impart as well as Michener's expose of Afghanistan.  Perhaps Michener's account is a theme too comprehensive, but the script jocks and producers missed or excluded key semaphores and symbols critical to the core conflict of the story.  As with many movie productions, the outcome of the story was altered, leaving one's impression off course.  May be that is to Michener's advantage in his original ""Caravans"".",1506211200,,434,5.171428571428572

8021367,3,B00023BN2O,Great movie. The package was damaged in shipping however. Looked like something crushed the box and the plastic DVD case was broken into a number of pieces.
