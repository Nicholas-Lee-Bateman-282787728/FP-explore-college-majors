8250014,3,B0013D8LXQ,"As the 1960s went by, Jean-Luc Godard was increasing adding social concerns and strident political messages to his films, but never without breaking traditional storytelling, however zany it might be with his French New Wave style. In 1967, however, he set off on a new direction. LE GAI SAVOIR was the first production that Godard shot after he bade farewell to his usual crew and dedicated himself entirely to political filmmaking. Originally made for French television, it was rejected and only screened at a few festivals, and it is easy to understand why: LE GAI SAVOIR still feels very avant-garde and intense today.

The film's title is best translated ""The Joy of Learning"". The two people that appear in the film are less distinct characters than representations of Godard himself: Emile (Jean-Pierre Laud) and Patricia (Juliet Berto) meet on a darkened soundstage and announce that they will study revolution. A heap of still images begins to appear on the screen: fragments of workers' union speeches, Vietnam footage, pornography, Parisian street scenes, Black Panthers, African guerilla movements, fashion shoots, advertisements from magazines, and comic books. Emile and Patricia (but really Godard) wish to make sense of everything they are seeing and to put it in the right order, for Godard believed that cinema could reflect the truth were its materials only presented in the right way. Biting the hand that feeds him, Godard attacks French television, as well as other European television networks, and Hollywood. Godard's leftist sympathies were more Maoist (or rather an infatuation with a sort of fantasy Maoism shorn of horrors it inflicted on China) than traditionally Western European Communist, and some of his biting criticism is directed towards the Soviet Union.

As the film opens with this chaos of social and culture themes, the dialogue is initially driven by free association, and there's a lot of humour in the way that Godard manages to link one issue to another. One can expect puns and bitter jokes, and Godard also whispers in voiceover over the proceedings as he famously did in his earlier film ""Deux ou trois chose que je sais d'elle"". In one section of the film, Emile and Patricia pose questions to three people brought in off the street: two children and an old man (the last seems a bit of a wino, really), basically giving a word and asking their interlocutor to say whatever comes to mind. This is intended as a way of showing how bourgeois society is or isn't willing to confront the issues of the age, but there seems to be some hope for the kids. The film ends on a hopeful note where the characters suggest that shots missing from the film will be shot by other well-known filmakers like Bertolucci. ""It's a bit vague,"" they say, ""But film makes people think."" (Godard's peers didn't quite take up his challenge.)

LE GAI SAVOIR is an interesting portrait of late 1960s Paris, or at least its radical side. Shooting began before the upheavals of May 1968, and Godard was certainly prescient of the coming wave of youth anger. Editing was finished after May'68, which allowed Godard to make references to Daniel Cohn-Bendit and his expulsion from France. Another way that the film is of its era is the way that Godard links his vaguely Marxist economic ideas with sexual liberation and psychoanalysis.

Jean-Pierre Laud seems to have less room for real acting here than in his other films of the 1960s, which is somewhat disappointing. Berto's part is remarkable, however. Godard hs the camera constantly study her face. Berto is so consistenly sad and pouty in Godard's films of the 1960s that the brief moment here when she laughs is absolutely shocking.

As LE GAI SAVOIR consists of vivid images, it really deserves a high-definition release so that viewers can take in all of the rich visual detail. But as a niche film, I realize that is unlikely for the time being, and the film is most accessible through the DVD release from Koch Lorber. I agree with another reviewer that the English subtitles are not ideal: not only are there some mistranslations from the French when the transcriber didn't hear the dialogue correctly, but subtitles are incapable of representing both the text shown on the screen and the lines spoken by the characters -- there's just no room for that, and this is a very wordy film. As a viewer with decent French, I enjoyed the film much more after simply disabling the subtitles.",1482364800,2,4463,4.921646746347942
8250015,1,B0013D8LXQ,"As an undergraduate film student I was forced to watch this in a film theory course.  It is, with the exception of Wavelength, the least enjoyable film experience I have ever had.  While non an anti-intellectual or a conservative, this is just leftist dogma being piled higher and higher.  Later, I took a course on Godard (so I'm not anti-Godard either) and was horrified to see this film on the syllabus.  However the second time around I was prepared:  I brought a full bottle of Excedrin.",1365292800,3,492,4.674418604651163
8250016,5,B0013D8LXQ,"This film is not for those who want to be told a story. Why I value it is that it offers a glimpse into the past, watching it is like going to school. It's challenging, I didn't understand 95% of it, but I'm fine with that. If you could see yourself saying something similar, then you may like it. I also highly value the menacing tone of voice Jean-Luc has for the voice-over, it's like he's really ticked off, and from an energy point of view it re-charges me.",1298851200,5,462,4.202247191011236
8250017,4,B0013D8LXQ,"The film is amazing, one of the least appreciated treasures of Godard's career, and it is not much like any of his other films; perhaps it's a bit like an update of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masculine-Feminine/dp/B000A88ERS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masculine Feminine</a>&nbsp;with the Maoist politics and more developed film critique of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Letter-to-Jane/dp/B0006Z2NAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Letter to Jane,""</a>&nbsp;but that's a rough analogy at best.  We might better think of it as a hybrid of Beckett and Debord, merging some of the minimalist aesthetics and intellectual foundationalism of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waiting-for-Godot/dp/0802118216/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waiting for Godot</a>&nbsp;with the overt media criticism of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Society-of-the-Spectacle/dp/0946061122/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Society of the Spectacle</a>&nbsp;(and the techniques Debord used in his film version of that book are much in evidence here).

We see before us a pair of student-militant narrators, Jean-Pierre Leaud and Juliet Berto as Emile (Rousseau) and Patricia (Lumumba), on a blacked-out stage.  They seem to be educating themselves, and us, in how to understand the world, and how to change it, over the course of three years (the first devoted to observing and theorizing, the second to self-critique, and the third to creation of experimental films).  The film, and the education, seems to be their nighttime project, perhaps also their splinter group and/or love affair; they talk sometimes about leaving to go back to their more regular days of protest.  Mostly, they voice their political and theoretical reflections over and between a sometimes breakneck montage of footage, sound, and image.  There is too much material here to do more than gesture to everything it invokes: there are explicit nods to, and quotations from, everyone from Descartes to Derrida, Marx and Mao to ""Marie-Claire.""  The sources of their ideas are usually what we might call philosophy of language, film theory and criticism, or third-worldist Marxism, but to list them this way implies a separation and systematization that the film quite pointedly refuses to provide.  The film is often called a ""manifesto,"" but apart from its politics this doesn't really describe what it says and shows to us: it isn't really declarative or polemical enough to merit the title, and it raises many more complicated questions than it gives simple answers.  This would be a poor place to start with Godard for any but the most committedly theoretical cinephile, but it echoes and provides useful background for some of his more recent works, Histoire(s) du Cinema and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Notre-Musique/dp/B0007Y8ABU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Notre Musique</a>&nbsp;particularly.  And it is a rewarding work of film theory and cultural criticism in itself if you watch it with patience and are able to pick up on at least some of its allusions and quotations.

This DVD produced by Koch Lorber, however, is a travesty.  The film is dark, scratched, and grainy, apparently having received minimal digital cleaning and restoration; there are some visible interlacing artifacts.  And the subtitling is really astoundingly bad, perhaps the worst I've ever seen; on-screen text often goes untranslated, as does voice-over when it doesn't match the image.  The subtitles we do have are riddled with lazy mistakes (e.g. ""RAND Corporation"" becomes ""big corporation,"" because the subtitler wasn't listening closely, and several times a line repeated verbatim is subtitled differently the second time around).  And, what's worse, the titles are full of solecisms and errors because the philosophically illiterate subtitler apparently didn't recognize the relevant quotations, allusions, or contexts.  It's clear that subtitling this film, like most of Godard's work, is a difficult task, because of the difficulty of its language, its ideas, and its cinematography -- but surely any of a hundred film scholars would have been happy to help Koch Lorber save themselves from this embarrassment.  This DVD is a truly shoddy job, and while we should be glad to be able to see the film at all, it deserves better.  English-language viewers should watch this with caution, because the subtitles are often simply wrong.",1213488000,30,4590,6.190251572327044
