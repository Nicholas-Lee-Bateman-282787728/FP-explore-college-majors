1655590,5,B00005RJ1V,"The Great Texas Dynamite chase, is a classic, 70s drive-in B movie. The beautiful, late Claudia Jennings, stars as prison escapee, Candy Morgan. She blasts her way out of the slammer, using sticks of dynamite. Candy learned her explosives skills through a training program for inmates, while she was incarcerated. Guess the clueless prison administration, never figured that inmates would use their training to break out.
ou
Right after escaping, Candy decides to rob a bank. It's the same bank that Ellie Jo, a young attractive woman, works at as a Teller. Ellie Jo's fascist boss, decides to fire her, for repeated tardiness. On the same day that Ellie Jo is fired, Candy bursts into the bank, holding lit sticks of dynamite. Candy threatens to blow-up the bank with the dynamite, unless they hand-over the dough. Ellie Jo, outraged at just being fired, enthusiastically helps Candy fill her bags with the bank's cash.

Candy quickly flees in an old 50s Buick, to her father's farm. She meets-up with her family, and gives them the stolen money. Candy's family is deeply impoverished. But now, thanks to Candy's larcenous ways, her father is now able to keep his farm. Reluctantly, Candy quickly leaves her family behind. She knows that she has to, realizing that the law will be hot on her trail.

Meanwhile, Ellie Jo feels cast adrift, after losing her Teller job. She feels stifled by living in her small, dull town. Ellie Jo wants out, and so she takes off, hitch-hiking to parts unknown, even to her. As luck would have it, Ellie Jo is given a ride, by none other than Candy.

Ellie Jo is overjoyed that it's Candy at the wheel. Candy's brazen robbery at the bank, has Ellie Jo brimming-over with admiration for Candy. Craving adventure, and with nothing better to do with her life, Ellie Jo begs Candy to let her join her, as Candy's bank-robbing partner. Candy quickly agrees.

Soon, the two foxy ladies are robbing banks with dynamite, rather than the typical firearms. Ellie Jo talks Candy into the dynamite method, after witnessing how easily Candy did it during the initial bank robbery. Candy and Ellie Jo, make their way across Texas, robbing banks and evading capture. They both become known by the public, as the legendary 'dynamite women', because of their use of dynamite, as their weapons of choice.

While robbing a convenience store, Candy and Ellie Jo take a young cowboy hostage. Ellie Jo soon falls for the hunky young stud. He suggests posing as a professional hostage. The women think it's a great idea, to help expedite their bank-robberies.

The three get richer and richer, from their thievery. They buy a Rolls Royce, stay in posh hotels, and enjoy a decadent, extravagant lifestyle. But as the law closes-in on the criminal trio, they realize that they need to get serious about hatching a permanent, fool-proof get-a-way plan.

In the 70s, Claudia Jennings was the undisputed queen of drive-in B movies. She'd acquired fame, as a former Playboy Playmate of the Year. Claudia wasn't just another gorgeous babe though. She had brains, genuine acting talent, and a graceful athletic ability. Most of all, she had a blazing-hot, on-screen charisma.

Claudia's spell-binding charismatic quality, was the engine that kept this film running fast-and-furious. As Candy Morgan, Claudia was a real scene-stealer. Jocelyn Jones as Ellie Jo, did a good job as Candy's partner-in-crime. But Jocelyn's performance was over-shadowed, by Claudia Jennings's commanding presence as Candy.

When this film was made, women were just beginning to appear in films as strong, competent characters. With it's two strong female leading characters, this movie was the template for future films in the same vein, such as Thelma and Louise.

I was a only a budding teen feminist, when The Great Dynamite Chase was made. This, and other films like it, were what my contemporaries and I looked forward to then . These films, were the essential drive-in B movie experience, in the 70s. Films starring Claudia Jennings, always fed our hunger to see female characters, who take control of their lives.

I highly recommend The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, for fans of the late Claudia Jennings. It's a tribute to her talent, and honors her as the queen of 70s B movies.",1257033600,3,4267,4.945530726256983
1655591,3,B00005RJ1V,"Seems many of the women who appear in a certain men's magazine have the same aspiration, to make it big as an actress in the movies...some have made the transition (to some degree), but for most, their dreams remain unfulfilled, most likely due to an actual lack of talent.  As I said, some did manage to cross over, one in particular being Miss Claudia Jennings, Playmate of the year for 1970.  She had a great many qualities, including and easygoing naturalness is front of the camera, attractive features, and a willingness to shed her clothes, this last one particularly handy given the roles offered to her in such exploitive B films like Deathsport (1978), Moonshine County Express (1977), 'Gator Bait (1974), Truck Stop Women (1974), Unholy Rollers (1972), and this film titled The Great Texas Dynamite Chase (1976) aka Dynamite Women.  Sad thing is, right about the time when she seemed to be rising above her exploitive beginnings (and getting her life back under control from substance abuse issues), her career was cut short after she fell asleep behind the wheel of her car and an accident ensued.  Directed by Michael Pressman (The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training, Doctor Detroit), the film stars, as I've mentioned, Claudia Jennings, along with Jocelyn Jones (The Other Side of the Mountain, Tourist Trap).  Also appearing is former Mouseketeer Johnny Crawford (""The Rifleman"", Village of the Giants), Christopher Pennock (""Dark Shadows"", ""General Hospital""), Tara Strohmeier (The Student Teachers, Candy Stripe Nurses), and Oliver Clark (A Star Is Born, Doctor Detroit, Ernest Saves Christmas).

Jennings is Candy Morgan, a recent escapee from a Texas federal women's penitentiary, whose first act upon self parole is to rob a local bank by threatening to blow the place up with some dynamite (seems Candy learned how to use dynamite in a prison work/reform program, and subsequently used it to aide in her `early' release).  After successfully liberating some funds, she passes the dough on to her family who were in peril of losing their dirt farm, and then takes it on the lam.  Soon she runs into  Ellie-Jo Turner (Jones), recently fired bank teller (the manager didn't like her modern i.e. loose lifestyle), the two become friends, and decide to team up and pull off more jobs together.  After a botched robbery attempt and a brief stop at a nearby mining operation to get more boom boom sticks (giving Candy a chance to get her groove on with a strapping, shirtless workman), the girls take their show on the road.  The begin hitting podunk banks all throughout southern Texas, eventually picking up a hostage named Slim (Crawford) who ends up throwing in the girls and the threesome continue on their merry way.  By now their antics are widely known (they're labeled by the media as the `dynamite women'), and the authorities are mounting a full scale manhunt (or womanhunt, whichever you prefer), taking a `shoot first, shoot again, ask question later' attitude, so what does our thieving trio do?  They get themselves a fancy white Rolls Royce...romance blooms between Ellie-Jo and Slim, the latter beginning to worry about the very likely possibility of getting shot dead, but the girls want to make one, last giant haul before heading south, that is if the Candy and Ellie-Jo can only manage to keep it in their pants long enough...

Originally released through Roger Corman's New Concorde company, the film has all his signature markings in that it's cheap, fast, and slightly sleazy.  But that's not to say it isn't any fun, because it is...hey, any movie where I get to see two sets of bazooms in the first three minutes ain't all bad (one should set their expectations accordingly to the material).  Corman may not have won any Oscars for his films, but few directors/producers knew their audiences better than he, and were able to give them what they wanted so consistently.  The film is pure drive-in hokum, released at a time when there was no such thing as a home video market...there's a seemingly female empowerment quality to the story, but it was really just `faux' feminism perpetrated by the filmmakers to allow for the ladies to run around braless, pop their tops, and bed male characters at any given opportunity, as also seen in other films of the time like The Student Teachers (1973) and Candy Stripe Nurses (1974).  The women audience members were supposed to identify with the strong female characters, while the male audience members got to gawk at jooblies...something for everyone.  The story moves along at a pretty good clip and features some decent, but not stellar, car chase sequences, along with silly hi-jinks and what not...the movie's listed as a drama/thriller, but there's a comedic undertone throughout much of the story, a breezy attitude highlighted by a whole lot of twangy, good old boy music, whose repetitiveness got old as the movie progressed.  Picture the Dukes of Hazzard with nekkidness and a bit more violence, with the main characters being women instead of men.  It did seem very odd that the girls should go out and purchase a big, old, white Rolls with their ill gotten booty, as it was conspicuous as hell, but whatever...if you're looking for some slick, high quality action, stick to the recommended releases on the shelves of the local video store, but if you're looking for some cheap thrills, the kind produced exclusively for indiscriminate drive-in audiences, then you're in the right place.

The picture, presented in fullscreen, is decent, but does feature quite a few noticeable flaws.  The DVD case claims to present a `digitally remastered' print, but I'm guessing that means using whatever copy they utilized in the past for VHS releases for the DVD release.  It is watchable, and after awhile I tuned out all the little imperfections on the picture and enjoyed the film.  I'm unsure what format the audio is in, but it does sound good and come through clearly.  Special features include an original trailer, along with various bios.  Also included are previews for other DVD releases like Caged Heat (1974), The Big Doll House (1971), The Big Bird Cage (1972), and The Arena (1974).

1655592,2,B00005RJ1V,"For some reason I was expecting this to be SMOKEY & THE BANDIT with hot naked broads and lots of explosions. Instead I ended up with a forgettable low budget stinker about two sickly looking women who rob banks in semi-deserted towns and then, much to my horror, take off their clothes! Agguh! Come on! Nobody wants to see that. Luckily there is very little nudity.

The film opens with Candy escaping (off-screen) from jail. She then robs a bank to pay off her father's farm. Like nobody's gonna be curious as to how a poor dirt farmer was suddenly able to pay off his debts in cash. But whatever, anyway, so now Candy is on the run from the law when she picks up Ellie-Jo hitchhiking. They quickly hit it off and next thing you know they're robbing every small town bank in Texas. Soon they have enough money to buy a white Rolls Royce(!) and even kidnap a handsome young stud to act as their hostage over and over and over again. Yawn.

I'd be willing to suspend reality a little bit and even overlook the lame script if the action scenes were good enough, but with only 10 - 15 explosions total and nothing but cheap cars bumping into each other it's inexcusable. I didn't hate the film, but I was thoroughly underwhelmed. Great title, boring movie. Skip it.",1102377600,6,1262,4.435344827586207
1655593,5,B00005RJ1V,"If anyone out there besides me watched ""Thelma and Louise"" and wondered why they had to drive off that stupid cliff at the end, and how exactly that denoted a ""happy"" and ""satisfying"" ending, you're gonna love this movie.  Funny enough, ""the Great Texas Dynamite Chase"" got it just right about 15 or so years earlier.
Yes, yes - the title is quite ridiculous, but do not (I repeat, DO NOT) let this scare you away.  Women robbing banks with nothing but dynamite?  Genius.  It's filled with the kind of... female empowerment that was strangely only tolerated in the context of a cheapie exploitation film.  It's loaded with what I've dubbed ""Charlie's Angels"" feminism -- that is to say, the women may appear to be tantalizing packages, but try to unwrap them on anything less than their terms and KA-POW! Duck and cover baby!  Besides, in this day of sexual taboos, it's pleasantly refreshing to see a movie that treats sex as fun and inconsequential.  (Ahhh, those were the days, eh?)  Plus, it stars underrated drive-in superstar Claudia Jennings, who gives a typically fever-pitched, ballsy performance despite suffering a back injury midway through filming.
It's high time this film was re-released after long being unavailable. Hey, Corman - how about following suit with ""Unholy Rollers""?",1014249600,12,1294,4.986046511627907
1655594,5,B00005RJ1V,"Claudia was so hot and had real star power.  Most might remember her as the agent who wanted to sign Greg Brady as ""johnny bravo"".  She was up for the role of Kate Jacksons replacement on Charlies Angels (the real one, not that lame movie).

7952410,2,B00005RJ1V,"I'm only giving this movie two stars out of sheer nostalgia, basically.
I first saw this godawful bomb in 1977 sitting around with a bunch of other
Long Island, NY adolescents and miscreants (the names will not be divulged
to protect the guilty) watching it on cable TV (I was all of
nine years old and lacked cable TV at my own house) flipping the channels also
watching Animal House and whatever else was on while the adults were downstairs
and blissfully ignorant of all this. Anyway, Dynamite Chase was only interesting at the
time due to the prospect of seeing Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones do their thing and take off their
clothes, with any luck.  And they do, but not enough, alas.  Anyway, when
you're nine years old and have almost no clue whatsoever about sex, this movie might be
scintillating in some perverse way, it was for me, and I recall being almost disturbed by the
shootout at the end where Crawford gets it from the two sheriffs with shotguns with all that preposterous,
fake as hell looking Roger Corman ketchup for blood: I've never seen more Heinz 57
come squirting out of a guy with a cowboy hat before I saw this film, then or now.
I was traumatized in 1977 but almost split my sides witnessing this nonsense at age 44
in 2013!

This is an entertainingly, yet gloriously stupid film, even though I know I have
permanently lost all those precious remaining brain cells that were destroyed all over again watching
this the other night for the first time 1977.  The girls were both cuties but not
so much that they're not believable in their roles as amateur bank robbers, I'll give
them that, they actually do both come off as just regular Texas chicks on a long bender.
But gosh they both look like they need to eat a few more cheeseburgers! And let's
have a serious moment here for poor Claudia Jennings, I've read what happened to her over the
past several years and I was very sorry to hear about her dying so young and all that, awful.
It's no Godfather or Dog Day Afternoon (to put it mildly), but if you want to turn off your brain and watch some
really ridiculous 1970s chicksploitation action trash cinema this is a prime place to
start. It's so unrelentingly cheesy, as is the wretched and annoying, nearly creepy/inane soundtrack.  The
goopy song being played during Jocelyn and ""Slim"" Crawford's ""love scene"" in the hotel may stay with
you, and not in a good way, and haunt your brain forever!  Be warned. It is hideousness
personified. At least Slim takes off his hat for the proceedings.

As is this film, but for some weird reason, despite it decimating my
IQ points frame by frame, it, bafflingly, retains a soft spot in my heart for corrupting my youthful
morals in 1977, so in that context, I still enjoy the Dynamite Chase for its stupid
gloriousness and the sight of the lovely Claudia Jennings nekked and Jocelyn Jones' perky it's always
cold out here in the Texas mid-day sun cleavage saying howdy through her tight cotton top.
The ending is so corny I thought Orville Redenbacher was gonna come ride down the Mexican Border
hills alongside the girls on their trusty, stolen steeds!  Yep, into the sunset.  But this ludicrous
desecration of celluloid is STILL so much better, even as a truly wretched 1970s bomb, than the really
annoyingly contrived Thelma and Louise. I'm assuming Joe Bob Briggs loves this movie, and well he should!",1359763200,3,3386,4.63
7952411,5,B00005RJ1V,"I only saw this movie ONCE when I was a kid in 1976, the year it was released.

This movie really left an impact on me. You might think its strange due to the fact I'm writing a review and can't remember anything that happened IN the movie, other than the fact its about two SEXY HOT women robbing banks.

But the reason I decided to write a review is because, I think of this movie all the time, and its been 36 YEARS since I saw it! I can't get it put of my head. The reason I can't get it out of my head is because it was so full of action, comedy, and drama! But the main reason I can't get it out of my head after all these years is because of the ending.

You think Thelma and Louise had a powerful ending? Or the Sixth Sense? Well you AIN'T seen nothing yet! I don't want to spoil it for people who haven't seent it, so I won't give any specifics.

There again. I can't remember anything specific that happened DURING the course of the movie, but the ending will literally BLOW YOU AWAY. And the ending has nothing to do with dynamite. I can only set the scene and tell you that its a shoot-out at a cabin near a lake. It will leave you breathless and a little teary-eyed.",1335139200,2,1179,4.004255319148936
7952412,5,B00005RJ1V,"For those of us who love these old drive-in movie classics, you won't want to leave this one off your list. The opening scene is Candy(Claudia Jennings) running through a field having escaped prison. She meets with her sister(Tara Strohmeier) who gives her a change of clothes (first nude scene). The movie then switches to Ellie-Jo Turner (Jocelyn Jones) waking up (second nude scene). She is a bank teller who shows up late for work. Her boss cans her at the same time Candy enters the bank with dynamite performing a bank robbery. Ellie-Jo prevents a teller from using the silent alarm, an early version of ""take this job and shove it"" attitude. Later Candy picks up Ellie-Jo while hitch hiking. Ellie-Jo wants to rob banks with Candy. Candy is able to swap sex for dynamite. The girls want to make one good haul and escape across the border.

Great things that date this movie: Sound track- it was hokey in 1976 too. The huge rebel flag on the bank wall. Posting a real telephone number and not a 555- number. The cops are too stupid to check the former home for an escaped criminal. See-through pink top worn by Ellie-Jo. Soft drinks in glass bottles. Gold painted Super-Beetle. Daisy Duke shorts with knot tied blouse. Rotor dial phones. Smoking permitted in public buildings. No silicon or razor.

She was tragically killed in a automobile accident back in the late 70's.  Johnny Crawford who played a little boy in the TV show ""The Rifleman"" is here for a romp.  He wasn't too bad, but his love scene in the movie with that horrible song in the background didn't help matters much.  All in all this is a great movie, with good music and some great scenes like when the dynamite wouldn't work when lit and it made like a light raspberry sound.  I saw this flick many years ago at a theater in San Francisco called the Pix, a little place where you had to keep your feet off the floor for the rats that were crawling about.
