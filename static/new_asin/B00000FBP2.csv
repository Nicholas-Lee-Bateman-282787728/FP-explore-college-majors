7908170,5,B00000FBP2,"I own many of these Roaring Glory Warbirds DVDs and I really enjoy them because they serve as your own private airshow!  I enjoy listening to Steve Hinton as he explains all the unique features of the aircraft and then he takes you through the preflight and take off.  It is great to hear the engine growl and see the plane fly!  The DVD has the original WWII training film, the pilots operating handbook (can be printed from PC or MAC) and an interview with fighter ace Col. R. Bruce Porter which serves as the basis for the Young Pilots reenactment segment!  If you love WWII aviation like I do, you will want to own all of these DVDs!

7908171,5,B00000FBP2,"The DVD gives a great  over all look at this plane. It's a super plane and a great way to see it if you can't see it in person. I fully enjoyed the DVD, and now have it on hand as part of my collection. I know this plane and this shows it very well, in good measure. Thanks. Sincerely, Rick L.",1355097600,,293,3.725806451612903

7908173,4,B00000FBP2,"This was the second of the Roaring Glory DVD's I purchased and I thoroughly enjoy this series.  Gives you a nice overview of the plane in question, this one the Hellcat.  Steve Hinton is a bit dry and talks kind of fast. He also seems like he is totally ad libbing the words which does not appear too professional.  But the Hellcat itself is the star of the show. The flight footage is fantastic and my only complaint about all of these DVD's is the fact that the actual new flight footage is just not long enough.  The flight sequence only takes about 24 minutes before it's over.  The extras on the DVD are nice to have.  Overall, get this series of DVD's for your warplane collection, but don't think it's an in-depth expose of your favorite warplane. It's nice eye candy and at $6 a DVD from the amazon sellers, it's nicely affordable.",1129507200,8,839,4.415584415584416
7908174,2,B00000FBP2,"Flying an aircraft is an acquired skill.  Pilots who are qualified to fly rare and unique aircraft such as antique warbirds should NOT be placed in the role of an historian unless they have proven knowledge on the subject being presented.  The pilot in this case is Steve Hinton described on the back of the video as an ""expert warbird pilot and Unlimited air racer"".

During his presentation, he tells the viewer that ""Grumman Iron Works"" is located in New Jersey.  Gulp!  While his detailed walkaround presentation continues, one would hope he would come across the legendary manufacturer's identification plate revealing the well-known location of Grumman.  It's all down hill after that.  His speech is too rapid and not always intelligible to the viewer.  One would think there would be a professional announcer or voice-actor aviation buff available on the cheap in Southern California for this obviously very low budget film.  The film attempts to reenact combat situations ala ""History Channel"" by splicing in WW II file footage of aerial combat with grimacing actors sitting and playing make-believe in a parked airplane in Chino, California at the ""Planes of Fame Museum"".  I won't even go into the detailed inaccuracies of  Navy/Marine Corps uniforms worn by the ""actors"".  The aerial shots of the museum airplane are great to watch as pilot Hinton flies the aircraft with the grace one would expect after reading how his piloting expertise is described.  Unfortunately, there's too much sub-amateur theater (awful) and not enough flying of this great airplane manufactured in New Jersey and at the ""Grumman Iron Works"" located at Bethpage, (Long Island) New York.",1104364800,18,1675,5.159259259259259
