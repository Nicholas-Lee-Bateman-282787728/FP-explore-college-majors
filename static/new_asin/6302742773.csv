7830383,5,6302742773,"This Nobel Jubilee concert from the early 90's features Dame Kiri and Sir Georg in music they both obviously love by Mozart and Brahms.  The Mozart songs may not be as familiar as some of the opera arias but they are lovely works.  The orchestral music, however is very familiar fare (The Marriage of Figaro Overture and the Brahms First Symphony) and beautifully performed by the Stockholm Philharmonic.  All in all, a delightful 86 minute program.  The VHS Tape is in the letterbox format.",1355788800,,491,4.809523809523809
