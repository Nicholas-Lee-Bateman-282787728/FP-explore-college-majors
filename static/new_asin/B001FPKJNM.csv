3588089,3,B001FPKJNM,"I love that there are 3 short sessions. I wish there was more variety in each session. He only does a couple poses and has you do them each 3 times or so. It gets a bit boring, even though it is short. I feel great after, its a nice stretch, but wish there was more variety. I do like that they are dressed, lets say covered well enough.",1267142400,9,337,3.898550724637681
3588090,5,B001FPKJNM,This DVD is a great introduction to Yoga and the 3 20-minute routines are great for catching when you can.,1264291200,,106,4.35
3588091,5,B001FPKJNM,"i like this DVD because it's simply presented, very clear and detailed . The teacher is very aware of all parts of each pose and points out parts of the body where you need to focus and relax. His style is straightforward without any spiritual gee-gaws, so it's great for beginners as well as more experienced yoga folks.",1262822400,2,321,4.551724137931035
3588092,5,B001FPKJNM,I really enjoy this DVD!  There are 3 simple workouts and you can mix and match for a longer workout or do just one if you are short on time.  The evening workout is especially relaxing and really helps me unwind after a hectic day.  DVD is easy to follow and great for those new to yoga.,1252108800,,288,4.017543859649122
3588093,5,B001FPKJNM,"My yoga studio closed, so I needed a good DVD to do at home and was looking for ""quick"" routines. This video, ""Morning, Noon, and Night"" is really perfect because it's divided into three 20 minute routines. You have the option of playing all three together to create a wonderful 60 minute yoga routine. Or, do what I do, enjoy three different 20 minute yoga routines on different days. The instruction is clear and easy to follow. The poses focus on beginner to advanced moves, with a great pace. This isn't a ""very beginner - never taken a yoga class"" type of video. I think it's helpful if you know yoga first, before purchasing this video. There is no ""what is yoga"" teaching at all. This is a flawless yoga video for someone looking for basic Hatha poses that flow wonderfully for a quick 20 minutes, 40 minutes or 60 minute routine!",1238976000,6,837,4.5131578947368425
3588094,5,B001FPKJNM,"I've had this dvd for about 2 weeks now and I'm really enjoying it. Because it's broken down into 3, 20 minute sections, it's much easier to squeeze a short practice in during my day. In fact, I did the ""night"" practice just before bed last night and the ""morning"" practice as soon as I got out of bed. The effects were amazing.... It's appropriate for yogis of all levels.",1231113600,6,373,4.3428571428571425
3588095,5,B001FPKJNM,"I've tried a bunch of yoga DVDs and videos, but I have trouble watching and doing at the same time--here, the teacher clearly explains what pose to take, and describes how to get into it. He uses the English-language names for the poses, but if you want to know the Sanskrit, that does appear on screen.

I also appreciate the way the sequences can be put together for a longer practice--although I've been using them at the times they're ""meant"" for... and I definitely feel more energized in the morning after practicing, and more relaxed at night. (I have to admit--I don't often manage to do the noon practice while at work...)

One last thing: I'm not a big fan of music during yoga classes, but the background music that plays during this video is actually a nice addition--very low-key yet appropriate.",1230940800,28,809,4.690140845070423
3588096,5,B001FPKJNM,"This is a great dvd if you are crunched for time, but I also enjoy combining the practices when I have time to practice a little longer.  Other dvd's with shorter practices that I have tried don't flow well when combined.  Mr. Crandell's short sessions work great together.  Also, Mr. Crandell's sequence and pose descriptions are very easy to follow and eloquent.  I don't find myself needing to pause the dvd to check out the pose, which is nice.  I highly recommend this dvd.  I also highly recommend Mr. Crandell's other dvd, Yoga for Well Being.",1230768000,11,550,4.677083333333333
3588097,4,B001FPKJNM,"Yoga Journal's Yoga for Morning Noon & Night offers three short (20 minutes each) yoga sequences, each designed to be used at a different time of the day. The practices are led by yoga instructor and Yoga Journal contributing editor Jason Crandell, who provides instruction via voiceover; he also demonstrates the postures along with two additional background exercisers. Each sequence begins with a very brief introduction by Crandell and then flows right into the practice, which features a sparse studio with gentle, non-obtrusive music playing in the background. Although Crandell cues all of the poses in English, both the English and the Sanskrit names appear on screen briefly at the start of each new posture.

The Main Menu of the DVD allows you to select each practice individually or to choose a ""Play All"" option. I have described each sequence in greater detail below:

MORNING
This practice is intended to boost energy, but it is designed to allow the body to awaken gradually.  The practice starts on the floor in child's pose and moves on to shoulder stretches, a simple seated twist, and cat/cow stretches for the spine.  Down dog and standing forward bend follow, and then eagle arms in chair pose provides an additional stretch for the shoulders.  Next comes a series of sun salutations:  2 half sun salutations, 2 full sun salutations, and then several additional rounds adding the mild backbends locust and cobra.  This is followed by a series of standing postures (warrior 2, triangle, side angle), first performed all on one side, then the other.  Th practice concludes with wide-angle standing forward bend and mountain pose.

NOON
The Noon practice is designed to foster strength; Crandell states that it is the most vigorous of the three practices.  It opens with three rounds of sun salutations followed by eagle arms to stretch the shoulders.  Next comes an additional three rounds of sun salutations, this time ending with warrior 1 and revolved warrior.  After using one additional sun salutation to transition to the floor, Crandell flows through a series of mild backbends, including locust, cobra, bow, and upright pigeon.  Downward dog is used as a transition onto the back for bridge pose, and then this practice concludes with thread the needle and savasana.

NIGHT.  This final practice is designed to reduce stress.  It begins on the floor for a reclined leg stretch using a strap and then moves into a reclined twist.  All of the remaining postures are seated, although down dog is performed in between some of the poses.  The first series includes a simple twist, a side bend, and cross-legged forward bend.  Next is cow face pose (legs only), half lord of the fishes, and cobbler's pose.  The final seated postures are forward bends, including head-to-knee pose (adding a twist), revolved side angle, and wide angle forward bend.  This practice ends with a brief seated meditation.  Crandell says that this practice will help to prepare your body for sleep, but I would suggest doing this more as an after-work, evening practice rather than a pre-bed one.

Overall, these are three well-done, well-designed practices.  In contrast to Yoga Journal's other recent release, Yoga for Well Being, I felt that these practices met their stated goals of providing options to match the time of day.  Crandell does a nice job with the voiceover instruction, although I would have liked to have seen mirrored cuing, as yoga practices in particular can be very difficult to follow when the instructor is not mirroring you.  As stated on the DVD case, these practices would be appropriate for beginning and intermediate students. However, those brand new to yoga would likely require more instruction and details on form than Crandell provides.  Finally, the DVD offers a short (3-minute) bonus interview in which Crandell describes his own history with back injury, anxiety, and insomnia.

Overall, I liked this DVD and think that it will particularly appeal to those struggling to find ways to fit yoga into their day.  Recommended with a final rating of 4 1/2 stars.",1227225600,118,4097,5.0460624071322435
3588098,4,B001FPKJNM,"After practicing along with Jason Crandell's short videos on Yogajournal.com, I was very happy to discover this new DVD! I would say Morning, Noon & Night is geared toward beginners or the perpetually unflexible like me, but I think intermediate students looking for a nice routine will not only enjoy this DVD but will look as good doing it as Jason and his two female students. If you're looking for headstands and upside-down pretzel poses, look elsewhere.

I've been to many yoga classes with different instructors and have purchased several different DVDs for home practice. Each instructor has a different focus, pace and voice and Jason Crandell is my absolute favorite instructor for home practice. His voice is calm and soothing, and his tone is very non-judgmental. His pacing is slow enough that you can a) strike a pose before he moves on to the next and b) hold the pose long enough to get something out of it.

Many instructors forget this. In fact, some of the yoga classes I've taken at my gym felt like Speed Yoga or were unabashedly Pilates/Yoga and I can't tell you how un-yoga-like that felt to me. If I want speed, I'll go to spin class; If I want to do crunches, well, I'd rather not do them during yoga.

If you like yoga that is relaxing, restorative, unkinks your kinks, and makes you incrementally stronger, you will love Jason Crandell. If he taught an online live class, I would sign up without hesitation. My only regret is that the nature of a DVD doesn't allow for any new poses or music. There were a few great poses missing from this DVD, like ""Sideways Plank"" and ""Tree Pose"". That's a minor complaint, however, and perhaps we have more DVDs  and online classes to look forward to...",1226793600,45,1717,4.656765676567657
3588099,4,B001FPKJNM,"Love this yoga video. My husband and I are total novices at yoga and this is a perfect introduction to yoga, which we incorporate into our workout routines when we need recovery days. I especially like the evening sequence that helps us wind down after a full and busy day. I have the Amazon video version, not the DVD so it only gets 4 stars because there are no bookmarks to skip ahead to the sequence you want to watch.",1466208000,,422,4.2875

3588102,5,B001FPKJNM,Excellent. I love the instructor Jason. He is through and teaches an easy flow sequence. Each session is 20 minutes long which works out great for me. A lot of times I'll run the morning and noon session one after the other to get a good 40 minute workout. I love it and feel great when done. I recommend it.,1464393600,,308,4.15
3588103,5,B001FPKJNM,I've really enjoyed the morning routine. It gently wakes you up and before you know it your body is limber and your mind is calm and alert ready to start the day. With the routine only about 20 min it's easy to fit in to my schedule. It's quick and gentle enough to not not dread the thought of it. He does a good job explaining how each pose should feel and reminds you when to breathe in a really smooth way.,1462752000,4,410,4.012195121951219
3588104,5,B001FPKJNM,"This is an enlightening, comprehensive, instructive video. Jason Crandell  generously punctuates each posture with the essential nuances of the posture in a calm and quieting authentic voice.

3588107,5,B001FPKJNM,My favorite go-to practices are the Morning and night yoga sessions. They are good without being very taxing which is perfect for those days when I am really not up for much yoga.,1457740800,,179,4.454545454545454
3588108,5,B001FPKJNM,Best yoga dvd!  Love that it has 3 sections or combine for a long work out. I've tried others...this is my go to!,1456358400,,113,3.9130434782608696
3588109,5,B001FPKJNM,"I rented this on Amazon Prime Video to see if it was worth purchasing the DVD. All I can say is wow! I had a very difficult week at my office job that left me so stressed that I have had a hard time sleeping and eating even. I did only the evening routine but I feel amazing now. I finally feel ready to rest! I think I will try out other other two soon.

The only thing I didn't like was that you had to search for the evening ritual in the video near the end since this was one hour long video. But, I suppose if you are doing all three segments in one go this would be a plus.",1453334400,,579,3.7459016393442623

3588111,5,B001FPKJNM,"This video is great for a quick workout - I usually do the morning and afternoon workout back to back when I have more time, or just the morning routine before starting my day.  It focuses primarily on sun salutations, twists and stretches for the back, and I find the pacing to be just right.  The routines are simple but go beyond basic, static poses so you feel like you got a workout in a short period of time.",1448841600,,414,4.227848101265823

My wife is a yoga teacher and thoroughly enjoys this video too.  Jason Crandell has a distinctively calming, and grounded voice which sets it apart from other teachers.  At 20 minutes per practice (minus savasana) it is a great way to integrate some regular home practice into your day.",1445990400,3,448,4.779220779220779
3588114,5,B001FPKJNM,Great video! I really like the way he keeps you focused on your breath and what your body can do. I also like how it can be done in segments or as a full hour session.,1440720000,,167,3.6666666666666665

3588123,4,B001FPKJNM,"Don't necessarily think that you have to follow the ""morning, noon, and night"" aspect. I've had a bad back for a while, so when I first starting using this DVD I stuck only to the nighttime routine (at all different times of day) as it was the easiest on my back. After a few weeks of doing it nearly every day my back is feeling really good (even my chiropractor noticed) and I've started slowly mixing in the morning routine as well.

What I like best is that the voice over is calming and frequently reminds you not to judge or push yourself, which make the process much more enjoyable but also in my opinion has yielded better results.",1427932800,3,639,4.369747899159663
3588124,5,B001FPKJNM,"Once again a beautiful series of yoga sequences.  The timing is appropriate and the cueing, I believe lets, individuals of all abilities take advantage of the Jason Crandell's expertise.",1427587200,,186,5.413793103448276
3588125,1,B001FPKJNM,"The yoga workout may be fine, but getting this as an Amazon Instant Video is not worth it. When played on my WiFi-enabled TV, there is no way to skip to the start of workout 2 or 3. I have to fast forward to the right spot...and that often crashes.

I CANNOT STREAM IT.  When I tried to stream it, about 12 minutes into the video, it began stopping, hanging, disconnecting, and has continued to do that about every 50 seconds or so when I do get it back up and running.  I cannot find information to enable me to contact customer service to get this straightened out, so it looks like I'm stuck.  Except that I'm not, because if I don't get some satisfaction out of Amazon, I will file suit tomorrow morning.

I did get in touch with Amazon, and they issued a full refund ($10.54).  Seems they did not really want to bother with trying to address the streaming issues.",1426550400,,788,4.25503355704698

Stress adds to diabetes sooo why not do yoga.  If you have any mental illness or HDL or diabetes just try this yoga it helps.  I love it!!",1380153600,,689,3.8368794326241136

It's my favorite Go-To video when I only have a total of 20-30 minutes or so. I like how you can combine the 20-minute segments (although there is some repetition if you do this) for a longer workout. The evening sequence is lovely for stretching and to do post running/cardio workout or at the end of the day. All the segments/sequences are thoughtfully put together.

3588158,2,B001FPKJNM,"When I do yoga I am not looking to be entertained or greatly challenged or break a sweat so from that perspective, this dvd fits the bill.  It is slow and gentle.  But other than that, I can't think of too many good things.  First, I am a beginner.  I have some yoga experience but not a ton and certainly not a daily practice.  This dvd says it is for beginners but I really don't think it is.  When I finish the morning or noon practice, my knees and lower back hurt.  I am sure I am positioning myself wrong in some subtle way but I don't know how to fix that because there really isn't much instruction on how to position yourself or use your muscles to hold the pose correctly.  There are only a few passing mentions of adaptations and the two women in the video are clearly advanced in their practice so there is no beginner to demonstrate modifications and to follow along with.  Second, it is overwhelmingly boring.  Again, I am not looking for entertainment but really.  I had to skip forward because I just couldn't do one more sun salutation.  The whole dvd can be summed up like this:  do about 5 million sun salutations, 1 million down dogs, throw in a whole lot of twists, a few stretches, and you're done.  The noon practice is really not a whole lot more than a combination of the morning and evening sessions so combining them all into an hour long practice is excruciatingly repetitive.  And on a side note, the picture shows the women in this dvd as well covered.  I'm not sure why because one of them wears pants and a sports bra in every session (which the cameraman seems to like because she gets a disproportionate amount of screen time).  That has nothing to do with the quality of the yoga instruction so I didn't mark the dvd down for that but it is annoying to me.  I do not like to watch half naked people and I would have passed on this one if I had known.",1368057600,2,1885,4.27683615819209
3588159,5,B001FPKJNM,"This is a great dvd in every respect. The set is beautiful--hardwood floors, soft lighting. I found that I liked the number of people--the three. Too many people is well, too many and too distracting. These three were in almost perfect sync, and very precise in their movements. All three sessions were excellent,,,except for the Downward Dogs. The first two had DD's. DD and inverted poses make my head pound. As I was watching the PM it was so good I would have bought the dvd just for it.  Until...yes, toward the end were two DD's! The twists and sitting forward bends were great. Even though I can't do the dvd, it still deserves five stars.",1367712000,,646,4.568965517241379

3588173,5,B001FPKJNM,I have a few yoga videos but this is by far my favorite. I have two small children and no yoga studio near where I live so home practice is really my only option. Having the short sessions helps insure that I can fit one in almost every day. The morning one is a great wake-up and I really enjoy doing the evening wind-down as does my 5yr old. I'm pretty out of shape and haven't done a regular practice for a number of years and the midday session is just challenging enough to keep me working for more. I tend to be really annoyed by chirpy instructors but I also like my instructors to provide encouragement and through instruction. Jason Crandell has a very nice low-key demeanor and I find that he explains things nicely for someone who has had a little yoga before. A brand new beginner might want to try one of the yoga journal videos that go step by step over many of the different poses before doing this so that they can get a good flow going without having to watch too closely but that's really just my personal preference.,1325635200,,1035,4.312820512820513

I have not done the noon practice yet, but plan to do it soon. You can also combine all three into one 60-minute session if you want a more intense practice.",1316995200,2,499,4.434782608695652

3588176,5,B001FPKJNM,"About ten years ago, Rodney Yee's AM/PM Yoga was one of my favorites.  When I went looking to buy a new yoga video, this came up and as it was by Yoga Journal, I thought I'd give it a try.

I really really like it.  The segments are short--and easy to do.  Perfect for me as a busy Mom of four to fit into my day.  It's tough to pick a favorite, although I'd probably say it's the evening yoga--with all of the bends and twists.  Totally doable for a beginner, yet you feel so relaxed after.  If you don't have a yoga strap, you can use a scarf--or any piece of fabric...even a towel or rolled up pillow case will work.

I think Jason could have shown more modifications in the poses, however.  For example, in the morning session doing traingle pose--no mention is made of the use of a block for those who are less flexible.  Similarly, in the morning pose, when one is sitting on one's knees, one can use a folded up towel or blanket if that is too difficult.

Right now, I'm combining this with the Biggest Loser Walking DVD.  Both contain short 15 minute beginner level workouts that I can intersperse throughout my day.  I may not be able to find an hour to exercise, but it's pretty easy to find 3-4 15 minute segments throughout the day.  Even though I might procrastinate a bit in getting started, within a few minutes, I'm always so glad that I took the time to do my yoga DVD or the walking DVD.
