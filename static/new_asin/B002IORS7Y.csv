8371072,5,B002IORS7Y,"I have several episodes of this series.  This episode & ""The Reef of Riches""  are the best in the series to me.  Beautiful photography with informative narration.  I also have ""Battle for the Light"" & ""Rivers of the Sun"" which are both very good.",1385856000,,246,4.5227272727272725

The ""Equator"" series is a wonderfully filmed, written and narrated nature series. In quality is matches, if not surpasses, the later and much more hyped ""Planet Earth"", ""Life"" series's. Unfortunately, the producers and/or distributors did not market it as successfully. As to the DVD releases, they also made a few blunders:

1. the cover of these DVDs are too gaudy, it makes one think of them as cheap children films. But they are not; they are professionally made nature shows.
2. they did not release them as a box set. In fact, it is very hard to find all the DVDs in the same series.

There are:
1) Power of an Ocean: The Galapagos and Palmyra ...
2) Battle for the Light: The rainforests of South East Asia ...
3) Rivers of the Sun: The mighty Amazon River ...
4) Paradox of the Andes: In Ecuador the equatorial sun ...
5) Reef of Riches: tropical jungle and on the coral reef ...
6) Challenge of Change > the Great Rift Valley ...

One day I will add all of these to my collection.

Note to Discovery: please release a box set of Bluray DVDs!",1292025600,,1119,4.360576923076923
8371074,4,B002IORS7Y,"The paradox of the title is that the equator is supposed to be the warmest place on Earth, but the higher one is in altitude there, the colder it is.  A subplot is that there are no distinct seasons there, but in 24 hours, it can go from below zero to scorching hot.  This doc looks at the animals who live there.  (It's implied that humans wouldn't live there.)
Vicunas, animals that must be related to llamas, only give birth in the day because a newborn couldn't survive the cold night.  Hummingbirds can flap their wings 20 times per second.  There is only one bear species in South America and it is not a carnivore.  Both males and females incubate condor eggs.  Some plants are so deep that frogs can rest in the ponds they make.  This documentary is full of insightful facts.
The work says the equator is the most biodiverse place.  It goes on to discuss many mammals, plants, and birds that live there.  Close to nothing is said about fish and insects.  Perhaps the those animals aren't as diverse as the others.  However, I wonder if this were Jungian and the documentary makers know that most humans don't care to see insects.
This would be a great thing to watch in a biology class.  It reminded me of how most featurs on living beings have a reason for being there.  This might be the type of thing that the Discovery Channel or PBS would show all the time.  Still, I enjoyed it.  Thumbs up!",1256083200,4,1404,4.404669260700389
