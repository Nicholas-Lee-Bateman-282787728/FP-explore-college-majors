4011448,1,B002Y38T9A,"We are fans of David White, but after seeing this film we would be hesitant to watch any more of his films. This movie was not family appropriate. My husband and I were embarrassed watching this with our children. It is not rated so we felt safe to watch it without previewing it first. The story line was just plain silly with no sound message involved. It was actually more on the immoral side. Very immodestly dressed women are seen. It should not be considered a Christian film as it does not advance the Gospel for our Lord Jesus Christ. The acting was very poor. We have seen secular films that had a better message to them. This movie does all Christians an injustice.",1281830400,14,675,4.451612903225806
4011449,1,B002Y38T9A,"We actually like David's movies, some are good (we really liked The Moment After movies) and some earlier ones are pretty cheesy, but this one is just plain dumb.

Please, do yourself a favor and if you want a couple recent ones that are good to watch -- go get ""Hidden Secrets"" or ""In the Blink of an Eye"" instead. Those you will very likely find worth your money and time, but this one will have you searching your memory as to whether this is or is not the dumbest movie you have ever seen.",1276905600,5,493,4.189473684210526
4011450,4,B002Y38T9A,"While I like comedy this one strecthes to far, David A.R. White who is a member of Pure Flix Entertainment and does a large number of christian movies some with and some without his wife Andrea Logan White. Usually these films are very christian oriented and walk the straight and narrow, however there some like Holyman Undercover while being hilarious seems at times out of place. The movie it self was ok and I have watched it a couple of times. This is not a family film for children under 14 due to its content.",1409270400,2,516,4.442105263157894

4011452,4,B002Y38T9A,adult movie or watch it before letting the kids watch it.it is funny tho'.,1404691200,,74,4.357142857142857
4011453,3,B002Y38T9A,We were a little disappointed in this movie starring David A.R. White - the story was good - but families may want to steer clear of some scenes in this movie - not really for kids....,1401148800,,184,4.138888888888889
4011454,4,B002Y38T9A,"This movie has it's moments.  Some of it is very ""indie"".  Mediocre camera angles and lighting, too-close or too-far ""documentary"" style shots, and some cheesy dialogue are definitely detractors.  That said, I laughed VERY HARD several times.  I also felt VERY UNCOMFORTABLE several times.

There were a few times, I admit, when I thought, ""this is really low-budget"". Sometimes, it was clear it was intentional, other times not as much. They were short lived, though.  Quickly it would move into a scene that was more polished.  There were some scenes that made me think ""Weird Al Yankovic could have written this"".  Not always in a bad way! Weird Al can be really funny.

If you take this movie as a sometimes really funny romantic comedy that is a stinging satire of Hollywood insanity while at the same time delivering a ""God is still in charge, even in the Gomorrah that is Hollywood"" message...I think you will like this movie. I did.

If you are expecting a polished, ""Pure Flix"" Christian movie of impeccable quality, scripting and acting...you will be ANGRY that you wasted time watching this movie.  It is what it is.

That said, there are more than I can remember good to great scenes in this movie....SPOILER ALERT

SPOILER ALERT - Don't Read if you don't want to know some of the best parts of this movie:

At one point, the lead character gets fired form an acting job where he portrays satan.  He says ""when you get fired from being satan, you know you're on a downward spiral"".

The director of a commercial pushes the lead character to ""be himself"" after he ""overplays"" a very dramatic ""devil"". She instructs him to 'act like you're talking to me'.  At that point, he looks into the camera in a soft, friendly, loving voice and reads the lines as as if satan were your friend.  He really cares about you.  He wants what's best for you.  It's a little chilling.

Jon Schneider takes over when White gets fired as satan.  He continues on in the ""satan is your friend"" motif.  He actually performs a song late in the move called ""the Devil believes in you"".  The most poignant, evil line in the song is something like ""all you have to do to let me take over is absolutely nothing...""  Again, it's cheesy and over done (intentionally), but if you are listening to the words and really thinking about what ""satan"" is saying...it's disturbing.

SUPER SPOILER:
There is a scene in the movie where a ""down and out"" lead character get's the typical Hollywood failure acting job...walking the street in a stuffed hotdog suit advertising the local food specials.  Pretty depressed about having lost everything, including his life, family, friends and new love...he has a ""Jesus moment"". In full hotdog suit with relish and cheese he starts running around in the middle of the street yelling ""Jesus is FREEEEE!"" and ""God Loves Hollywood"", ""God Loves Los Angeles!""  I won't ruin it all for you, but I was laughing so hard I was crying when this short scene was over.  It was funny, but what a POIGNANT TRUTH:  WHen you have lost everything and are hopeless, loveless, and pennyless:  JESUS  IS FREE.  This is the kind of tongue in cheek, gritty, cheesy...TRUTH you should expect from this movie.

If that is your thing...you will like it.

If you go in expecting a more modern, serious, Pure Flix drama...you will be very disappointed.

I liked it.  I liked it A LOT.  White and Pure Flix are truly missionaries to Hollywood, and the entertainment world.  Godspeed David, et al.",1400803200,3,3482,4.701986754966887
4011455,3,B002Y38T9A,"Funny movie! All though you may not want little kids to watch it. It's kind of like an adult comedy. It has a good message. It's storyline is a little over doing it on some subjects, but other than that and possibly an adult comedy, no complaints!",1398470400,,247,4.276595744680851
4011456,4,B002Y38T9A,Funny movie a spoof on hollywood and it is Christian based.  It is fun for the family some parts might need to be explained to your kids...but yu can use it to teach them.,1398211200,,171,4.029411764705882
4011457,2,B002Y38T9A,"I was hoping for a funny movie that still shares the gospel in a good way....unfortunately that is - in my opinion - not the case.
Maybe others think it is funny but I would say it is noisy, turbulent and a wishy washy message which I did not expect. Normally all movies by David White are very very good movies (which in fact was the reason I purchased this movie)",1394496000,2,365,4.154929577464789
4011458,3,B002Y38T9A,"while my family disliked it, I loved it.  I took it for what it was and had a good time laughing.  My husband had to walk away from the movie as it was corny and cliche and my 14 year old son cowered behind a pillow from some of the overly stupid embarrassments.  I would have given it a 4 but due to my family's reaction, I could not give it such a high review.

Just remember to take it for what it is, a spoof of good and evil in Hollywood.  Terribly cliche and silly, but a great laugh if you try not to think too hard.",1388707200,,523,3.8055555555555554
4011459,3,B002Y38T9A,I normally enjoy all of Mr. White's movies. This had some funny parts but it just wasn't what I expected. I think this was one of his earlier movies. A lot of his other movies are really good especially the newer ones. I love the concept of an guy who is Amish going into show business.,1384560000,,286,4.125
4011460,1,B002Y38T9A,"It was obvious after watching the first 12 minutes of this film, that its producers  and backers are ultra, right wing religious conservatives: Obvious partisan remarks about CNN, President Carter...

4011463,3,B002Y38T9A,"David A.R. White is one of my favorite actors. However, he is not one of my favorite comedians. This movie just didn't work for me. There were some redeeming moments but the most part this seemed like frivolity. If someone wanted to be harsh enough, they might even suggest this mocked on-fire Christians who are unabashedly share their faith. I don't suggest that extreme. It just didn't match David's other movies. If you're just looking for a few laughs to kill time, this might work for you. I don't have enough time to kill any of it. If you're looking for a clarion call to repentance, this one will disappoint you.",1360195200,,621,4.603603603603603

The one-star reviewers really need to lighten up.  This movie has a great underlying message and that's what should be focused on.  The parody of Hollywood, L.A. and all its trappings is just too funny! (I live here in Los Angeles, and it's dead-on accurate!).. Loved this movie and would definitely watch it again.

4011468,5,B002Y38T9A,"This movie in a sense is a parody of the stereotypical ""lost in Hollywood and needing to find myself again"" flicks.  In an attempt to be a parody of secular films, it actually ends up being a great parody of a Christian film!  I understand why some true believers get upset with this movie, it has a lot of sexual and homosexual references and it seems to be making fun of Christianity through out the film.  In all reality- it seems like an atheist made this movie to parody the Christian film industry.  Don't count David White out, he got the comedy thing right with ""Me Again""- that film is the one you want to see if you are a true believer!  If you just want a classic Ed Wood B movie so bad it's actually laugh out loud hilarious comedy- this is the movie you want to see!!  I think this may end up a cult classic someday if it ever lands on basic cable!",1342656000,,861,4.156626506024097
4011469,3,B002Y38T9A,"Roy (David A.R. White), an Amish man, ventures to LA to preach the word of Jesus. He meets his uncle (David A.R. White) and accidentally gets cast into the role of Satan due to his attraction for the casting director (Logan White). The movie is corny and is not a good representation of the Amish who don't wear fake beards...but do tend to marry their cousins. Fred Willard plays a network executive who hates reality TV shows. Jennifer Lyons plays a sexy actress, Tiffany Towers (not the porn star) who co-stars with Roy. They are made to go out on dates while Roy's heart belongs to Annie.

The acting was hokey. The support cast was far better than David White. The script was predictable. Not overly preachy. The hokey factor of the film seems to make fun of religion as much it does promote it.

No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. Essentially kid safe. Okay Family movie.",1335139200,,870,4.57051282051282

4011473,4,B002Y38T9A,"An Amish ""youth,"" Roy, heads to Hollywood to find his long-lost Uncle Brian and spread the gospel only to end up playing the Devil on a popular television show in this terrific farce.  This comedy is apparently based on the real life of David A.R. White, one of the most likable and popular stars in the Christian film industry.  This was the first Christian film that actually made me laugh out loud -- which shouldn't have been surprising with its veteran supporting cast including John Schneider, Edie McClurg, Clint Howard and the always hilarious Fred Willard, who is worth the price of admission himself. Not only that, it's a great ministry tool too. The temptations Roy battles in the film are just like the temptations faced by youths everywhere -- particularly the overwhelming pressure to conform to the world's definition of success and popularity.  Roy ultimately learns the hard way that it was his faith and his values that attracted people to him in the first place.  Laughs and a good message.  What more could you want?",1309219200,5,1037,4.836158192090395
4011474,1,B002Y38T9A,"This movie was disappointing and annoying. I really like many of the films these actors have been in previously and had high hopes for this one simply based on the participants. What a letdown. Considering it is advertised as a comedy, it wasn't funny. I laughed once early in the film about the joke of a fiddler who once went to Woodstock and never really returned, and didn't laugh the entire rest of the movie. I watched it on the GMC channel, which often broadcasts terrific faith-based programming, so I don't know if I actually saw the entire movie since they often cut movies short for commercial time, but what I saw was not at all the same good quality of the other movies these actors have been in. This is not a movie for young children since the characters behave so immaturely and without the Christian morals that are usually prevalent in films with these actors. There are also unnecessary and partisan snide remarks about CNN and President Carter that seem to have no reason other than to make political statements which don't fit in the film. It is not until the last 10 -15 minutes of the movie that the main actor ( David A.R. White), an Amish man who has been corrupted by money and immoral living, gets an epiphany (while in a hot dog costume) and turns his life around. His girlfriend (played by the main actor's real-life wife, Andrea Logan White, who was so good in ""Sarah's Choice"", ""In the Blink of an Eye"", and the Moment After movies) has a violent knock down/knockout fight with a woman who made moves on her boyfriend. Only during the last moments of the movie does the lesson of nothing in the world in worth losing your soul get communicated. There are so many other movies these actors have been in, from the early Christiano Brothers films like ""Second Glance"" (which was MUCH more funny than this film) and ""End of the Harvest"", ""The Crossing"", ""Mercy Streets"" (which also has a great soundtrack), to ""Hidden Secrets"" (a terrific movie!) and more. I have bought and shared many of the movies these actors have been in and have shared them with others. All I can say about this movie is it was a waste of time to see it and I hope they go back to making the other kinds of films again. There are many actors in this film that are in the other videos, some of which I've listed, and I highly recommend those films over this one.",1290902400,7,2362,4.482598607888631

4011477,4,B002Y38T9A,"Picked this movie up at the Christian Bookstore after a recommendation from a friend.  Didn't expect much in the way of theological depth, but was surprised at some of the ""faith issues"" that arise when cultures clash.  I think we christians take things too seriously sometimes, but it was refreshing to watch a movie just for a silly laugh.  This movie provided many laughs like some of my favorite secular movies (naked gun,dumb and dumber, tommy boy)and yet, sprinkled throughout the movie were ""discussion starters"" if you invite unbelievers to watch with you.",1284681600,5,564,5.043010752688172

This guy has done so much for the faith based market place with one great film after another.

i was especially impressed that he co-wrote, plays 2 characters and directed the film!

I love that he works with his friends, Stacy Keanan, Gregg Binkley, Brad Heller, John Schneider, not to mention his lovely wife ms. Andrea Logan White all have been seen in many of his films.
