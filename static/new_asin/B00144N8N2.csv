I love all the elements of this film.
Editing is kind of repetitive, so you end up looking at some of the footage many times.
I loved that there is an American scholar who can speak Tibetan.
I mean this place this film covers is so beautiful and amazing.........so any film about it can be great.
This film is informative and bit academic.
As a film, it is not a masterpiece.
However, to learn about this specific place, this place can be a must!",1318377600,4,470,4.3522727272727275

Using reenactments, the story features the riches and opulence of the Royal Family, and the collapse from the King's brother encouraging the Ladakhis to attack in the early 1600s.

The filming of Tsaparang is excellent. I would prefer more information and film of the paintings and statues",1254182400,6,458,5.273972602739726
