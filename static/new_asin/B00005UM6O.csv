1665868,3,B00005UM6O,"Betsy (Shirley Temple) is a little orphan girl who knows that the world should just all ""smile, smile! Smile and be happy!"" Her cheery attitude gets her adopted into a theatrical family who resides at a hotel, but the landlady wants her money, and the troupe has none. Fortunately for Betsy, the landlady's nephew (George Murphy) is sympathetic to their cause and wants to help.

Little Miss Broadway is pleasant but standard. The story is absolutely unimportant; the stars are really the highlight.

One of the most exciting things about this movie is the brilliant supporting cast, a bunch of character actors with plenty of personality. The most famous one is Jimmy Durante whose trademark nose and gravelly voice are just foundation for smiles. Donald Meek and Edna Mae Oliver play well off of each other as spouses who never agree. El Brendel appears in the jazz band and has a few cute scenes with a penguin. I have found that most people dislike him, but I adore his childlike grin and phoney accent. George and Olive Brasno appear as (what else) two midgets from a show; they are best remembered today for their several appearances in the Our Gang films.",1216512000,,1162,4.776119402985074
1665869,5,B00005UM6O,"Little Miss Broadway is yet another charming movie that stars the great Shirley Temple. The plot moves along at a good pace and I thought that the acting was very convincing.

The action begins when Betsy Shea (Shirley Temple) is adopted out of a girl's orphanage by William J. ""Pop"" Shea (Edward Ellis), who manages the Hotel Variety in New York. Betsy will be living in the Hotel with ""Pop,"" his daughter Barbara Shea (Phyllis Brooks) and a host of actors and vaudevillians who are mostly out of work.

Things heat up when Sarah Wendling (Edna May Oliver), who owns the Hotel Variety, finds out that the hotel is back due on the rent--to the tune of $2,500! That was very big money in those days; and Sarah Wendling eventually gets so angry with the situation she plans to tear down the hotel. Meanwhile, her nephew Roger Wendling (George Murphy) falls in love with Barbara Shea--and things get very complicated and messy.

Will Sarah Wendling tear down the hotel and leave dozens of people homeless? She certainly won't be willing to help her nephew Roger financially if he has anything to do with Barbara Shea. Will ""Pop"" Shea and the others living in the hotel be able to raise the required back due rent money? How does Betsy figure into the plot? Will she stay at the hotel or will she return to the orphanage? No spoilers here, folks--you'll have to watch the movie to find out.

The choreography shines in the final ten minutes of the film when there's a lot of singing and dancing numbers; look for a wonderful number featuring George Murphy and Shirley Temple.

The DVD comes with the glorious black and white version of the movie; the restoration is wonderful. There is also an option to watch a colorized version of the movie instead.

Overall, Little Miss Broadway is a charming Shirley Temple vehicle that leaves you smiling and wanting more. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I recommend it for Shirley Temple fans and people who want their children to ""discover"" Shirley Temple. Look also for a fine performance by Jimmy Durante as one of the entertainers living in the hotel.",1200614400,12,2094,4.692098092643052

1665871,4,B00005UM6O,"LITTLE MISS BROADWAY stars Shirley Temple in another harmless musical confection especially tailored to her talents.  As in most of her film vehicles, she plays an orphaned show-biz wiz who comes to the rescue.

Temple plays the sparky orphan Betsy Brown, who lives with her surrogate family at the Hotel Variety, a favourite spot for showbusiness types.  Things look grim when the hotel is to be torn down for a new development.  Betsy decides to appeal for help from the cranky landlady Sarah Wendling (Edna May Oliver).

There are plenty of prime opportunities here for Temple to display her musical skills (""Be Optimistic"", ""How Can I Thank You?"", ""We Should Be Together"", ""If All the World Were Paper"", ""Swing Me an Old-Fashioned Song"").  She is joined by a talented cast, not least of which Jimmy Durante, who turns in a spirited performance.  Edna May Oliver was unrivalled when it came to playing snooty society dames, and she doesn't disappoint, playing the foil for Temple's sweetness.  George Murphy and Phyllis Brooks supply the romance.

LITTLE MISS BROADWAY will be a charming addition to your Shirley Temple collection!",1178236800,2,1134,5.053763440860215

She is funny and timeless, way before even my Mom's time and both my Mom and I and my nieces love her!  This is a non-generational must watch family movies, that not only are funny, fun and entertaining, but help instill values that seem to have been lost in our times!  This collection will make you laugh and cry as Shirley draws you in with every word.",1153526400,2,484,4.415730337078652
1665873,1,B00005UM6O,"I gave two of my older granddaugther ""Curley Top"".  They are now both Shirley Temple fans. I was told the picture quality was OK and they (parents and children) love the movie.  I have not viewed it myself.  I hope it is all they report it to be.

I did have an opportunity to view one of my recent purchases ""Little Miss Broadway"". I was very disappointed in the quality of this movie.  At some points in the movie faces were not distinguishable (facial features appeared to melt), some actors and scenery are colorized and someone next to them may not be.  Overall, it was a disappointment.  In my opinion it would have been better in black and white than with the feeble attempt to colorize.  I am surprised that it was released in such poor quality.  I have purchased several of Shirley's movies as gifts for my granddaughters as Christmas gifts this year.  My hope was to create a Shirley video/dvd library for all three. I grew up with Shirley and adored her movies (black and white of course and my husband reminds me that the quality of the movies was not all that great then so why would I expect a colorized version to be all that great..good question). I will hold off on my decision to continue with the libaries until after Christmas when I have an opportunity to view my recent purchases.  If I had had an opportunity to view this one, I never would have made the purchase.",1099094400,10,1387,4.442687747035573

1665881,5,B00005UM6O,"This 1938 film stars Shirley Temple and veteran song-and-dance man George Murphy, a future U.S. Senator from California, who team up to save an unemployed vaudeville troupe (including the legendary Jimmy Durante, who dances with Shirley in one sequence) from eviction from the Hotel Variety, which is partially owned by Murphy's character's aunt.  The film is fast-paced and features two great Temple-Murphy dance numbers:  ""We Should Be Together,"" and the title track, which is set in a courtroom, where the vaudevillians finally win their case.  Like most of the Shirley Temple DVDs, there are black-and-white and colorized versions of the film, English and Spanish audio and subtitles, a fake stereo soundtrack, and theatrical trailers and newsreel footage.  The trailer for this film, however, was partially destroyed and features only music; there are no title graphics or narration.

Fun to see all the vaudevillians who live in the hotel practicing their acts -- getting a glimpse of their lives (including the penguin in the tuxedo!).

1665884,5,B00005UM6O,"This might be the best of all the Shirley Temple movies of the 1930s because its so interesting start-to-finish.

The only annoying person is Edna May Oliver, who plays the standard mean old lady who is out to ruin things for the """"good guys"" Fortunately, she's not in a lot of scenes and eventually even changes her thoughts for the better. The rest of the film is nothing but nice people who are a lot of fun to watch. George Murphy and Phyllis Brooks are the typical for Temple movies: a super nice, handsome young couple which gets together in the end.

Edward Ellis plays a nice old man and Donald Meek nearly steals the show with some funny lines and funny faces. I thought James Durante would be funny, but he had more of a straight than comedic role.

Other features which make this movie stand out from normal Temple fare were unique characters (midgets, twins, penguins and more) and a tremendous amount of songs and dances (much more than normally heard).

All the elements that made Shirley Temple's films so successful are rolled up into this movie. Great stuff!",1236816000,,1075,4.612565445026178
