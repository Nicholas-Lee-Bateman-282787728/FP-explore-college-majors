7967096,2,B00006CXTL,"This video was okay...I mean, the basic premise is that of a few other videos out there...it's okay to be sexy. That in itself is great.

This video is too similar in alot of ways to The Art of Exotic Dancing for Everyday Women, which is one of my favorites and I've had for years! It just isn't as good.

Yes, I was disappointed. I suppose I learned a little bit more than I already knew but it wasn't worth the $20+ .",1165536000,,419,4.036144578313253

7967098,4,B00006CXTL,"this is good for the average women who is not confident about her body and wants to strip for her husband.for this purpose it is good. It has regular women in there 40's I guess and no showing of any body parts, it just shows you in a instructional way some easy moves.not recamended if you are young in your 20's and know moves already. it is just very basics moves enough for the average women to satisfy her husband and to get basics down.

if you are looking for real strippers get sinsational strippers(it is hot hustler women in their 20's stripping naked and lap dancing and pole work like if you were filming at the strip bar, not instructional just soft porn if you like strip bars), how to strip dvd is real strippers or were but they don't look good and are older showing there moves(very disapointing), but the carmen electras set of 5dvds are great and get you in shape while instructing you on moves for lap dancing and stripping and dancing(love them)",1111536000,32,966,4.4576271186440675
7967099,5,B00006CXTL,"I've bought a number of erotic dancing and stripper videos/dvds.  This one does an excellent job of outlining  basic erotic core or beginning moves for the upper and lower body.  Also, I really enjoyed seeing the women do their final dances on the end segment. It's great to see amatures give such sexy performances.

Additionally, Susan gives good tips on clothing, props and how to create an erotic environment in the home.  This tape is geared to women who have never done erotic movements and is not for women who are looking for advanced erotic movements.  Also, this tape does not cover basic floor work or pole work.  I highly recommend this dvd for women who want to quickly learn how to give their lovers a sexy, erotic treat! Buy it, practice the moves and drive him/her wild!",1099958400,81,786,4.6521739130434785
7967100,4,B00006CXTL,"I gave this video 4 out of 5 stars because I felt the title was misleading. I assumed this video would teach you sensual dance *IE: Along the lines of bellydance* but it didn't. It was more geared towards stripping or erotic dance.
This video is worth 5 stars if that's exactly what your looking for. Not to sound as if I'm way above that, but honestly..Look into the ""Sensual Art of Bellydance"" with Neena and Veena Bidashi. This video here teaches you it's ok to do it for yourself, but...Who wants to strip for themselves? I found Neena and Veena's video's to be more for me. The girls are sexy but NOT intimidating, and you learn a lot of moves that make you feel sensual, sexy and feminine. Especially with out all that ""Feel like a goddess"" fluff that this video does incorporate. With this video I felt like a bull in a china shop more then I did the sexy goddess it was trying to make me feel like. With Sensual art of bellydance, I can do sensual and sexy moves without that ""bull in a china shop"" feeling that the 'erotic' moves on Sensual dance for every body made me feel like. Great movie if your looking to learn how to strip, if your looking for self esteem and sensuality in dance, I would look else where.",1043625600,13,1222,4.317391304347826
7967101,5,B00006CXTL,"This video is so fun and easy that I find myself practicing it more than any other video in my collection.  Anytime I feel a little down about my body I just pop in this video and reconnect.  It immediately boosts my self-esteem.  My husband has noticed a difference in my new ""attitude"" and certainly appreciates my new skills!  This video will be on my Christmas shopping list for all of the women in my family and my friends!",1032134400,2,428,4.379746835443038
7967102,5,B00006CXTL,"I found this video very helpful in encouraging me to make friends with my body. I love how the women on the video could be you and me- they're not simply barbie-doll types but real women. The moves are simple and easy to follow. I also love the little tid-bits of information and trivia she gives you along the way. I have seen a few other videos, but none quite like this one- it is a well-needed addition to womens interest videos!! I highly reccommend it to every woman. Thanks so much.",1031961600,,489,4.326086956521739
