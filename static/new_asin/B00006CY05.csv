7967387,3,B00006CY05,"On 19 April 1996, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and his wife, Nicky, made a personal pilgrimage to Changi Prison, to see the cell his father was kept in as a prisoner-of-war during World War II. His father, Sir Alexander Downer, was interned in Selarang Barracks from 1942 to 1943 and then in Changi Prison from 1943 to 1944. Downer also visited the Changi Memorial Chapel, where Sir Alexander had worshipped during his internment, the Selarang Barracks, and the camp parade square, where 17,000 Allied POWs were ordered to assemble in 1942.

He was the godfather of Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer, brother of Diana, Princess of Wales. The Earl's godmother was Queen Elizabeth II.

Gordon's episode was a very light echo of the Selarang Incident

On 30 August 1942, as a pre-emptive measure, the newly arrived Japanese Commander General Shimpei Fukuye wanted the wholly British and Australian POWs interned at Selarang Barracks in Changi to sign a ""No Escape Pledge"" after the recapture of four escaped prisoners from Changi Prison earlier. The four escapees were Australian Corporal Rodney Breavington and Private Victor Gale, and English soldiers, Private Harold Waters and Private Eric Fletcher. The pledge reads: ""I the undersigned, hereby solemnly swear on my honour that I will not, under any circumstances, attempt to escape.""[3] With three exceptions, everyone refused to sign, because the prisoners saw it as their duty to escape if they could. Under the Geneva Convention, POWs had the right to attempt to escape and they were not supposed to be punished if they were recaptured. However, at that time, Japan was not a signatory to the Geneva Convention. General Fukuye was furious at the mass display of insubordination and the following day he ordered all prisoners, except the three who had agreed to sign, to congregate at the parade square in Selarang Barracks. What ensued was to become known as the ""Selarang Barracks Incident"".[1]

The Selarang Barracks, originally built to accommodate 800 men, consisted of a parade ground surrounded on three sides by three-storey buildings. A number of smaller houses for officers and married couples were spread out in the spacious grounds. Nearly 17,000 men[4] crammed into a parade ground of about 128 by 210 metres and in the surrounding areas.[1] An Australian POW, George Aspinall documented the situation:

  The first and most urgent problem we had to face up to was the lack of toilet facilities. Each barracks building had about four to six toilets, which were flushed from small cisterns on the roofs. But the Japanese cut the water off, and these toilets couldn't be used. The Japanese only allowed one water tap to be used, and people used to line up in the early hours of the morning and that queue would go on all day. You were allowed one water bottle of water per man per day, just one quart for your drinking, washing, and everything else. Not that there was much washing done under the circumstances.[5]

The Executions

When there were no signs of the POWs backing down on the third day, General Fukuye ordered the Commander of the British and Australian troops in Changi, Lt-Gen E. B. Holmes, and his deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Galleghan, to attend the execution of the four recent escapees -- Breavington, Gale, Waters and Fletcher. One of the Australians, Breavington, pleaded to no avail that he was solely responsible for the escape attempt and should be the only one executed. Their executions were carried out by the Indian National Army guards with rifles on 2 September. The initial volley was non-fatal, and the wounded men had to plead to be finished off.[1][6]

Despite the executions, the prisoners remained firm as the days ensued. Without food and little water available and coupled with latrine pits, kitchens and hospital beds crowded into an area of about a square kilometre, dysentery broke out quickly and the sick began to die. Realising that more would die needlessly, the prisoners' commanders decided that they and their men would sign the pledge ""under duress"". On 4 September, Lt-Gen Holmes issued a written order to his men:

  The requirement by the Imperial Japanese Army, issued under their Order No. 17 dated 31 August '42 that all ranks of the POW Camp Changi, should be given the opportuntiy to sign a certificate of promise not to escape, has now been amended in a revised Imperial Japanese Army Order No. 17 dated 2 September '42 to a definite order that all officers, NCOs, and Men of the POW Camp shall sign this undertaking.

  I therefore now order that these certificates will be signed by all ranks, and handed by Area Commanders to Command Headquarters by 1100 hrs on 5 September '42. The circumstances in which I have been compelled to issue this order will be made the subject of Selarang Special Order No. 3 which will be issued later.[7]

As the Japanese weren't familiar with British names, the POWs signed using false or meaningless names. One of the most common signatures among the Australians was Ned Kelly, a famous Australian folk hero.[5] After the signing was completed, the Japanese allowed the prisoners back to their former areas on 5 September, thus ending the incident.

During the Singapore War Crimes Trial in 1946, General Fukuye was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad at the spot where the four POWs had been shot three years earlier. The four shot POWs were later honoured and buried at the Kranji War Memorial after the war.

If we undertood what the British Commonwealth suffered at the hands of the Japanese, it would illuminate things like the fact that the HK government served expensive rice to unemployed Chinese who stood in line for ""beggar rice"" during mass unemployment after the war - because those who were detained at places like Changi went on to posts in colonial government in Asia.

It's Changi Lite in terms of not depicting the extent of the horrors inflicted in that place that make the name legendary to the Chinese.

But any mention of Japanese sadism nevermind a recent miniseries is always a good thing and consistently, the Aussies are the ones who are openly critical of modern Japanese behavior.  I can't even discuss what the Japanese did with my own Chinese mother who refuses to hear details coming out of my mouth probably because she remains terrified that my father's triad murderers will do something like that to me.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Hiroshi Abe (born ca. 1922) is a former Japanese soldier. As a first lieutenant in the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II, he supervised construction of the Burma Railway at Songkrai. Over three thousand British Commonwealth prisoners of war died under his supervision.[1]

Abe was sentenced to death as a B/C class war criminal and imprisoned in Changi Prison. In 1948, his sentence was commuted to 15 years. He was released in 1957.

  ""The construction of the railway was in itself a war crime. For my part in it, I am a war criminal.""[2]

In 1995, Abe testified against the Japanese government in a lawsuit seeking compensation for Koreans in Japan during World War II. ""This was probably the first time for a former Japanese officer to testify in court in the trial of war compensation issues.""[3]

After many uphill struggles since the first pilgrimage to Japan in 1992. Agape has taken hundreds of FEPOWs to Japan's former war camp sites. Many FEPOWs express how their hated towards Japan has changed into love for the Japanese people. [Keiko] Holmes was awarded the O.B.E by Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle on 28 April 1998. She attended the ceremony with her sons Daniel and Christopher.

In the 2003, Holmes met the Emperor and Empress of Japan in Buckingham Palace, England.[citation needed]

In 2004 Holmes, Kosuge and some other members of Agape including Holmes' son Daniel Holmes went to Nanjing, China to apologise for the crimes committed and pain inflicted by her country men during the war. Holmes also has visited Malaysia, Holland, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, United States, Canada and India holding meetings and lecturing at universities.",1406678400,2,8204,4.9904692082111435

It is an interesting depiction of the situation in the Japanese prisoner of war camp in Singapore during Woeld War 2.  It is quite good, but can get dull at times.",1129334400,3,243,4.041666666666667
7967390,4,B00006CY05,"It is a pleasure to have occasion to rave about quality of acting.  In this Australian WW II gem, the actors' portrayal of the full gamut of human emotion associated with the POW experience, and with the contrast of that experience with their lives before and after, is exact, convincing at every turn, and alone makes Changi worth buying.  Add to that a compelling story line, constant underlying tension, brilliantly effective use of flashback to make subtle but profound points, and the multifarious talents of the cast, and the result is a real winner.  Instinct tells me that this is a bit overdramatized -- that a real POW experience, with the aura of death and threat, would not necessarily be so effectively countervailed by hijinx and camaraderie as is portrayed here.  On the other hand, this Japanese/Australian conflict has been too often ignored by ""mainstream"" WW II movies in the U.S.  And it is delightful to see that this Australian-produced item is guided by a sophisticated vision of concept and audience more similar to British productions than to the dumbed-down American media of late.",1084752000,17,1107,4.994565217391305
