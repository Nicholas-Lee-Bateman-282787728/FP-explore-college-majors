8017430,4,B0001X1UAU,"Not completely un-watchable first attempt by untrained director, W. Mel Martins. I have seen much worse by UCLA film graduates which makes this film interesting because back in the early 90's before independent films where the in thing, This ex cop with absolutely no training and no background in film making actually wrote, produced and directed this film that actually has a decent story line and narrative thread. Even though technically hideous in some parts with unmatched color timing and amateur camera moves, the editing is quite good and the film  is not actually all that bad. I give him Kudos for some obvious raw talent. The story line is a simple one. A woman thinks a serial killer is living in the small apartment building she lives in. When she snoops around for evidence, things get a bit strange and suspencful. Not a bad watch when your by your self on a dark stormy night.",1199664000,,893,4.7243589743589745
