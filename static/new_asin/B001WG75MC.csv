8347568,5,B001WG75MC,I have been a fan of Ms. Pietrobruno's work for years and this film is yet another example of her wonderful talent.  And what an interesting concept - a glimpse into the sex trade from a john's perspective!  Brilliant and very entertaining.,1252281600,9,240,4.690476190476191
8347569,5,B001WG75MC,"I think this is an excellent film. It's real, compelling, and
intelligent. The editing pushes you along through the story with such
smoothness; very well done. I actually laughed a couple times at how
well some parts of the movie were cut together, you just don't see that
sort of effort put in everyday. The viewer is vaulted from one scene to
the next in such a seamless, but poignant way, it almost catches you
off guard, while leaving you thinking it was just the way it should be.
The acting is great, and it's such a unique perspective. David Lewis
slaughters it. Stellar. He makes it come to life. Can't really fault
the film in any way worth talking about. go see it.",1252108800,9,675,4.451612903225806
