2544964,4,B000EXDS2A,"Ok--many of you may not be aware but the remastering of THE TIME TUNNEL means WE get edited prints. Let me explain. First, YES, I want to complement FOX on the Quality of the DVD's for Time Tunnel. They are Stunningly beautiful transfers, especially compared to the fairly miserable quality of the LOST IN SPACE series on DVD (NOT in Hi-Definition!!).  Ok--now on to the ""editing"" of these Time Tunnel episodes. While it is true, they have ""restored"" all of the cliff-hangers, they have tweaked out pieces of the episodes originally broadcast weekly. During the opening credits, EVERY episode ended the opening credits with ""The Time Tunnel brought to you By"". This has been snipped. In the middle of the show--at the half-way point--there was a station ID break ""The Time Tunnel will continue after statrion identification"", and at the end of each show the announcer said complete with Time tunnel graphic slide ""The Time Tunnel has been brought to you by"". The Dvds have removed this for some reason.  Now--comes the most important ""re-edit"". In the original print of END OF THE WORLD,...the cliffhanger goes to the Pearl harbor episode ""Day the Sky fell DOwn""..at the end of this cliffhanger ORIGINALLY--there was a different soundtrack used over the ""Next week See This Fantastic Adventure..in The Time Tunnel"". The reason that music was changed--is because originally there was an announcement ""The Time Tunnel will return with exciting scenes in the weeks to come"" !!!  there were three one minute promos for ""these are exciting scenes""..I belevie Fox put TWO of those three on the firs tset of DVDs..they seem to have LOST  the third one. And they retooled the music and editing of the Day the Sky Fell Down Cliffhanger. NOT COOL. How do I know all I have said? I have poor VHS copies with all of the video I stated has been removed. OH--and what happened to the OPENING PIECE ""THE TIME TUNNEL IN COLOR!!"" this was shown at the beginning of all 30 episodes...why was it removed? Thes prints are ""recut""..the stories are uncut--buit the bumpers are all gone!!",1148947200,7,2065,4.857954545454546
2544965,5,B000EXDS2A,"Back in the 1990s, and entire new generation like myself was introduced to this fantastic show when it aired on the Sci-Fi channel in the morning.

It was so sad to know that this show only made 30 episodes at the time. It wasn't by any means a ratings failure either. Like ""Gilligan's Island""...some executives decided that they had a better show to put in its place at the last minute which in the end was a mistake for them anyway.

They had already thrown a fantastic party for another season. The show was just getting off the ground when it was cancelled.

The first half of this set Volume 1 shows just how great a new show can be in its first year. Unforgettable episodes like ""The Day The Sky Fell In"" and ""Invasion"" are classic reasons why this show has stood so long all these years even being a one season show.

The next set is even more fantastic as we are introduced to aliens when Tony and Doug come across them when their thrown onto their spacecraft in the year 1883. There would be two more run ins with aliens in the final episodes, but between them comes the best episode of the whole series ""Chase Through Time""..that should have been saved for last as season finale instead of ""Town Of Terror""

The final seven episodes of the series are missing the best part of the show and that is the narration of how the Tunnel started, we are replaced with them tumbling threw the vortex to their next destination which in the very beginning of the show no one in the complex could see till they landed and they got a probe on them, someone changed that and made a small mistake.

Finally, the only choice one can make from this show is that the show goes in a loop as Tony and Doug go back to their first landing which was the Titanic...it was made like this so it would be assumed that they are in a time loop re-living the same time peroids over and over again.

Time Tunnel was extremely ahead of its time with graphics and by far the most expensive of its time.

Its a shame that the 2002 revival of this sweet show didn't happen, but we have the pilot to enjoy and we can dream how sweet the series would have been and could have gone.",1144281600,28,2153,4.2727272727272725

I thought we the fans would have wait another 6 months to a year, but happily we all can enjoy it soon. I was only 10 when it first aired, but, I always remembered it. i loved the stories with the historical backrounds, fantasized about all the possibilities of time travel.....( hey, i was a kid )it also reminds me of the times we lived in as compared to today. i remember watching it with my entire family,do families still do this? anyway i'll be buying this when it comes out for the good stories and the good memories.( also can't forget the Tony Newman character, what a total hunk )",1142899200,3,709,4.291044776119403
2544969,5,B000EXDS2A,"While the second collection of 15 episodes from the single season of THE TIME TUNNEL (ABC 1966-67) doesn't necessarily consistently shine quite as brightly as the initial group comprising the content in volume one there are still some commendably well done segments to be found nonetheless that includes ""Kill Two By Two,"" ""The Walls of Jericho,"" ""Idol of Death,"" ""Billy the Kid,"" ""Pirates of Deadman's Island,"" Chase Through Time,"" ""The Death Merchant"" and ""Attack of the Barbarians"" being the more noteworthy.

It is at this midway point in the season that producer-creator Irwin Allen broadens the series' premise to include capricously outlandish encounters with Robin Hood, Merlin the Magician, the wrathful spirit of the Roman Emperor Nero and even extraterrestrial beings (on four separate occasions).

Featured celebrity guest-stars and veteran film and tv performers impressively in evidence are Robert Duvall, Mako, Robert Walker, Jr., Eduardo Cianelli, Malachi Throne, Michael Ansara, Byron Foulger, Richard Jaeckel, Myrna Fahey, Allan Case, Paul Mantee, Abraham Sofaer, Lawrence Montaigne, Christopher Carey, Mabel Albertson, Anthony Caruso, Vitina Marcus, Del Monroe, Michael Pate, Donald Herron, John Hoyt, Lisa Gaye, Arthur Batanides, Jan Merlin, Peter Brocco, Ronald Long, Phillip Ahn, Arnold Moss and John Saxon.

The remaining 15 episodes are:

16) ""The Revenge of Robin Hood"" (30/12/1966)
17) ""Kill Two By Two"" (06/01/1967)
18) ""Visitors from Beyond the Stars"" (13/01/1967)
19) ""The Ghost of Nero"" (20/01/1967)

29) ""Raiders from Outer Space"" (31/03/1967)
30) ""Town of Terror"" (07/04/1967)

As in the previous volume one set, series fans can look forward to pristine video transfers taken from fully restored and digitally remastered 35mm source elements with each segment presented, including the original cliffhanger endings, complete and intact.

Welcome supplementary archival material will consist of the made-for-tv film TIME TRAVELLERS (1976) which was intended as Irwin Allen's follow-up to his 1960s SF tv classic (starring former TIME TUNNEL alumni Sam Groom and derived from a story concept credited to Rod Serling) along with original series cast member interviews of James Darren, Robert Colbert, Lee Meriwether and Whit Bissell in addition to a (roughly) 3 minute special presentation of the shelved 2002 TIME TUNNEL revival effort pilot will also be included to further augment this exceptional 4-disc collection.

Despite the fact that our two intrepid time travellers were never returned home again (due to the show's premature cancellation after only a single season) THE TIME TUNNEL (with its stellar luminary casting from Hollywood's finest, always diverse and interesting storylines and groundbreaking Emmy Award winning visual effects) remains to be an enduring, immensely popular Television of the Fantastic favourite since its inaugural primetime airing nearly 40 years later that continues to enthrall and delight new generations of fans captivated by errant Project Tic-Toc scientists Tony Newman and Doug Phillips' ongoing exploits into new realms of colourful adventure and spellbinding excitement that was as much an invention of the vivid imaginations exhibited by the contributing staff writers as it was a reflection of the glorious pages in history.

2544970,5,B000EXDS2A,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of this series, and am delighted that Fox has decided to release the remaining episodes.  Good show!",1142294400,4,136,4.913043478260869
2544971,5,B000EXDS2A,"Fans of THE TIME TUNNEL were treated to the release of the first half of this series on DVD in early 2006.  That set was amazing in terms of the visual clarity and restoration work done to make these tranfers truly remarkable in quality.  The praise for Fox is well-deserved, as the episodes looked better than they ever had before.

THE TIME TUNNEL aired on the ABC-TV network in the US during the 1966-1967 television season.  Produced by Irwin Allen, THE TIME TUNNEL was the shortest of his series, receiving an untimely cancellation in the spring of 1967.

This set, VOLUME 2, brings us the remaining 15 episodes of the series, completing the run of 30 total episodes.  Here are the episode numbers, titles, and original air-dates of the episodes making up VOLUME 2 in the DVD series:

16 THE REVENGE OF ROBIN HOOD-Dec. 30, 1966
17 KILL TWO BY TWO-Jan. 6, 1967
18 VISITORS FROM BEYOND THE STARS-Jan. 13, 1967
19 THE GHOST OF NERO-Jan. 20, 1967
20 THE WALLS OF JERICHO-Jan. 27, 1967
21 IDOL OF DEATH-Feb. 3, 1967
22 BILLY THE KID-Feb. 10, 1967
23 PIRATES OF DEADMAN'S ISLAND-Feb. 17, 1967
24 CHASE THROUGH TIME-Feb. 24, 1967
25 THE DEATH MERCHANT-March 3, 1967
26 ATTACK OF THE BARBARIANS-March 10, 1967
27 MERLIN THE MAGICIAN-March 17, 1967
28 THE KIDNAPPERS-March 24, 1967
29 RAIDERS FROM OUTER SPACE-March 31, 1967
30 TOWN OF TERROR-April 7, 1967

Though the writing quality of some of the episodes tended to deteriorate in the second half, there were still some fine episodes in this bunch.  KILL TWO BY TWO plunges our heroes onto a Pacific Island where a sad chapter of World War Two plays out.

CHASE THROUGH TIME features three time-transfers sending the scientists over a two million year timespan.  And other episodes deal with historical figures like William Bonney (""Billy The Kid""), Machiavelli, himself displaced in time to the American Civil War, and even Biblical hero, Joshua.

And then there's the aliens...  Well, this IS an Irwin Allen series, and you really didn't think that the LOST IN SPACE costumes would go to waste, did you?

As a bonus, this set is also featuring the 1976 TV-movie that Irwin Allen developed called THE TIME TRAVELERS.  It featured Sam Groom (""Jerry"" from THE TIME TUNNEL) and Tom Halick as a pair from the present day who are sent back in time to find and preserve a long-lost cure to a present-day epidemic.  Sent back to Old Chicago, they locate the doctor who developed the cure (played by Richard Basehart) and have to get it from him before the great fire destroys the town.  This film was a pilot for another possible time-travel series.  It aired on ABC, but was never picked up as a series.  The script was from an idea by Rod Serling.

Fans of THE TIME TUNNEL are delighted that this series will finally be out in its entirety.  New fans have developed with the release of the first set.  All in all, 2006, the fortieth anniversary of THE TIME TUNNEL, is shaping up to be a pretty good year.",1142035200,151,2949,4.630769230769231

2544998,5,B000EXDS2A,"The Time Tunnel was a Science Fiction show of the 60's that lasted only one season. We were usually in bed by the time it aired and we never saw it in syndication. I caught an episode on MeTV recently and decided to buy the DVD if it was reasonably priced.

The season is divided into two volumes and the first season does not disappoint. I liked the technical aspect of the show the most and always wondered how the actors ended up becoming a part of history vs. changing history.

Its too bad the series was short lived.

I especially liked the two movies (one that came before the Time Tunnel series & the one for a planned reboot of the series). The reboot was on the darker side but very well done. I hope that the series gets another chance at a reboot. Seems like there would be plenty of material for the show.",1479081600,,818,4.230769230769231

2545055,4,B000EXDS2A,"1966-1967: ""Time Tunnel"" - (3 to 4)  -  General Kirk has a tiger-by-the-tail;  his top two scientists find themselves in dangerous situations on every temporal transfer;  worse still, the time tunnel is only grounded in the present - the other end, like an out-of-control fire hose, could put them anywhere and any when;  and worst of all, he could lose them forever unless, after every transfer, they locate them, get a fix on them, and transfer them again before it is too late . . . .

1976:  ""Time Travelers""  TV movie  -  (4)  -  Film based on a story by Rod Serling (Twilight Zone).  A deadly disease, thought to be extinct has roared back to life in New Orleans.  In 1871, a similar outbreak was controlled by Dr. Henderson, curing 25 of his 27 patients.  Unfortunately, his records were destroyed in the great Chicago fire.  Two men are sent back to 1871 to find out how he did it;  but Henderson hasn't a clue and time is running out before the fire engulfs them . . . .

2002:  ""Unaired TV Pilot""  -  (5 plus)  -  A highly classified fusion experiment has gone awry;  when its accelerator tunnel was powered up, it unexpectedly created a rogue time storm, burrowing through time and space making random changes in the past, changing the present.  Fortunately, the changes to history ripple slowly towards the present allowing a team to go back in time to, hopefully, mitigate the alteration of the present.

Experimenters have observed a major wave of changes that originate on a German battle field in 1944.  A team is put together but they need an expert on that bit of history.  They enlist, Doug Phillips, a family man, to go back in time to help find the source and correct it before the present changes.  When Doug breaks mission protocols, Toni Newman confides to Doug how her life changed following the storm's outbreak;  later Doug learns his life too had changed . . . .

2545060,3,B000EXDS2A,"I was mesmerized by this show when I was an eight year old in 1966 and it ignited a love of history for me.. I bought it for nostalgic reasons. But the acting and scripts are pretty corny and some of the history is inaccurate as well. The show had a great concept and great potential and much could have been done with it but Irwin Allen and crew had an odd creative sense - very pedestrian and sometimes the story lines are almost ridiculous. On the plus side, for 1966 the special effects are pretty good, especially when our heroes are drifting from one historical moment in time to another and the Time Tunnel Control room was pretty well done as too. The realism is fleshed out by the numerous out-takes from movies that were spliced in to set the historical stage beyond the scenes filmed on the studio back lot. But in 1966 - 67 as I child, this show gave me my first introduction to such historical events as the Alamo, the siege of Troy, Halley's Comet, Rudyard Kipling in Afghanistan, the Battle of New Orleans, etc, etc and for that, I will always have a soft spot in my heart for it, no matter how corny and sloppily done most of the show appears to my

The disappointing fact is that the network/powers that be at this time period did not go past the 1st season. However dispite that fact this is pretty good considering special effects in the 60s were not like they  are now. There are some familiar faces in the episodes that Trek fans will recognize from TOS episodes. In The Time Tunnel, each episode has a somewhat screwed view of events in history which the main characters, Tony & Doug [played by James Darren of Gidget fame, and Robert Colbert] sometimes think they can change history [the Titanic disaster, Custer's Last Stand,  Linconln's assination] If you want to make comparrisons, you could call this a forerunner to Quantum leap, the difference being, Quantum Leap the time travel could only take place during the main character's lifetime, Time Tunnel, the main charactrs jump all over the place during history.

Fewer episodes dealing with the past were produced in favor of speculative ""future"" episodes, where the writers and producer could have a little more leeway.

Despite all this, stars James Darren and Robert Colbert gave solid performances, as well as their support team, Whit Bissel, John Zaremba and Lee Meriwether.

2545175,4,B000EXDS2A,"The Time Tunnel which originally ran during the TV show season of 1966/67,was unfortunately just a one season wonder. However it is a series which still captured the fancy of many a viewer back then and it still holds quite an appeal today.
The show involves the adventures of Project Tic-Toc run by General Kirk(Whit Bissell).Two scientists Tony Newman(James Darren) and Doug Phillips(Robert Colbert) are the time travellers who from week to week are injected by the tunnel from one random time period to another. Many of the story lines were quite interesting while others could be run of the mill. Overall though the acting was top notch and the special effects pretty good for that period.
Irwin Allen,the producer,made liberal use of the 20th Century sound archives for background music and effects and the video archives for filler scenes.
Volume Two to me is a bit more satisfying than Vol. 1 in that it seems to have more to offer as far as special features go. There are:interviews with Whit Bissell,Lee Meriwether,James Darren and Robert Colbert,a still photo gallery,a rare unaired 2002 TV pilot called ""The Time Tunnel"" and a 1976 Irwin Allen produced TV Movie called ""The Time Travellers"".
The 2002 pilot is uninspiring and has a totally unbelievable story line. It involves the story of a man recruited to go back in time to the WW2 battle of the Hurtgen Forest. It occured from the fall of /44 to early /45 and was one of the deadliest battles of the war for the Germans and Americans. It seems a 1500s monk has been dropped into the Forest by erractic waves of time and that he has effected the future as a result. It's up to the team that's assembled to correct the situation. The story is ok up to this point but falls like a rock off a cliff from here. The team they assemble is made up of three men and two women!! First of all there were NO women combatants on EITHER side of that battle. Secondly one of the women is black. Thirdly neither woman gets challenged by any soldier outside the group when in battle. In reality they would stick out more than a unicorn in Times Square!
If you can get past these points,and I couldn't,the story is still mediocre at best. It's a good thing it wasn't picked up but it's still an interesting thing to see/have.
""The Time Travellers"" is a made for TV movie from 1976 starring Booth Colman and Richard Basehart. It involves a Rod Serling story of a plague taking place in and around New Orleans during Mardi Gras Time. A doctor and a man connected directly with the time project go back to 1871 Chicago to find the answer from a doctor(Basehart) who apparently has the cure.
This show is far better than the 2002 pilot,because if for no other reason, it was written by Serling. Basehart gives a good performance as the period doctor but again the plot, over the approximately 70 minutes this plays, starts to wear a little thin. But again a good piece of video to own.
Like Volume one of this two volume series this has NOT been remastered,but the masters used are of such high quality I can see why they didn't. The only problem of note was the second to last ep in the entire group;it has about a 10 minute bout with several vertical black dirt/scratch lines that distractingly appear. If that was all I could see I'd say that's not bad overall.
Like the previous volume this also is a double sided four disc set. I really get annoyed with this double sided production of DVD sets. First of all it's cheap and secondly they are SO prone to scratching. Furthermore this entire season could have been put into just ONE set and with just one -sided discs at that;there was NO need to over charge like this and split it into two. But then again I see that Irwin Allens' TV shows ALL charge at a much higher rate than most others. Unfortunate.
In conclusion Vol. 2 of the ""Time Tunnel"" finishes off the one and only season with our intrepid travellers Tony Newman and Doug Phillips played well by James Darren and Robert Colbert respectively. Even though the show was just a one-off it had ALOT of potential and plot wise could have gone anywhere had it continued. It is so unfortunate this is all there is but I for one am grateful we have this.
It's also a show the entire family can watch and enjoy and it is,I daresay,educational in the sense that the travellers do go back to actual historic events/dates which are played fairly accurately.

Personally, I remember the series as a child, and am pleased that the children of today can find as much pleasure in it now. The children said that they loved learning about real things that happened (one of them took a DVD to a social studies class where they were learning about the events in one of the episodes and got permission to show it to the classmates, who are no enthusiastic about The Time Tunnel themselves...). The visual effects might be a bit outdated for what we are used to today, and the transitions from movie bits (which were used to cut on the cost of production rather than shooting full scope events from scratch--call it TV recycling...not a bad idea) a bit choppy; but overall, the show still holds.
One question I remember asking as a child and which my nephew asked, as well, was ""how come the time tunnel staff can send and bring back so many people and stuff and things but Tony and his friend are always tumbling in the infinite corridors of time?...""

2545196,4,B000EXDS2A,"What made this show work when it was aired was not only the interaction between the cast but also whatever historical timeperiod they visited you wanted to go out and research that time frame. The first episode was probably the best because you get to see the long spiral of the tunnel from the side (I don't think that was ever shown again) making it look like a huge expense for a set at its time. If you can overlook obvious flaws such as:

- why no matter what clothes they were wearing or how disheveled they were, Tony still ended up with the same green turtleneck sweater and Doug his perfectly pressed business suit.

- No matter what time period or country they went to, everyone spoke modern English.

- They usually ended up at key historical moments (this made you see how they would try to change history (unlike Star Trek) such as preventing the Titanic from being sunk or Lincoln from being shot.

- The consoles that they looked at (squiggly lines) with huge tape drives along the sides of the complex.

Viewer be aware that this series like Lost in Space (another Irwin Allen creation of the 60's) does not get resolved in the end.  It would be nice if the Scifi Channel could produce a continuation to the series with an end resolution.

I had never seen the pilot episode on the Titanic since I saw the series in 1967, so I never knew how Tony and Doug got lost in time in the first place. Now I have! Interesting to note why Dougs costume of suit and tie stayed with him in time. It was actually the dress of the Titanic era when he landed there. Also enjoyed the 2002 unaired pilot....looks like this was an attempt to bring back the series. I wish a producer or film maker would have another go. You can have so much variety with time travel.

2545200,4,B000EXDS2A,"If you acquired the first volume, Volume 2 of THE TIME TUNNEL is a must.  You have to put TIME TUNNEL into its historic perspective.  This show premierd at a time when creater Irwin Allen could do no wrong.  With successful shows like LOST IN SPACE and VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, Irwin continued his sci-fi victory streak with THE TIME TUNNEL.

For those who missed the first half of the DVD release, the plot is not unlike that of a later generation's QUANTUM LEAP.  Two American scientists enter the experimental Time Tunnel and find themselves bounced backward and forward in time.  Unfortunately the Tunnel technicians seem to be able to retrieve everyone except for poor Tony Newman and Doug Phillips.  As such, Tony and Doug randomly appear at historic moments through time.

Let's face it, the storylines in Volume 2 are not Emmy Award material. In fact, some of them are just plain dumb.  History is recreated on a shoestring budget using existing 20th Century Fox sets and borrowed footage from film vaults.  Volume 2 also has two episodes where we are treated to silver-faced aliens who look like escapees from LOST IN SPACE.  Some of the Jupiter 2 props also make it onto TIME TUNNEL's soundstage.  No matter.  The highlights of each episode are the scenes involving the Time Tunnel set itself.

Two of the special features in this DVD set deserve special mention.  First is an Irwin Allen 1976 pilot for a series very similar to THE TIME TUNNEL.  Alas, the familiar tunnel complex is replaced by a closet-sized office and cheap staircase.  On the other hand you have to remember that the 1970s was the decade of THE INCREDIBLE HULK, WONDERWOMAN, THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN, THE BIONIC WOMAN, and THE NIGHT STALKER.  Maybe a time travel staircase was not that farfetched.

Better is the unaired 2002 pilot for a new TIME TUNNEL.  The pilot leans on themes closely tied to the 1960s series.  In watching the exceptional pilot you could not miss the heavy influence of STAR GATE SG1 and THE X FILES.  In the 2002 TIME TUNNEL our heroes, including Doug Phillips and ""Toni"" Newman, go back in time for very specific missions and return back to the complex at the conclusion of the show.  The tunnel, though not as beautiful as the 1966 version, is probably more realistic.

It is a shame that this series only lasted one season -- thus the likely reason the season was released as two separate volumes.",1173744000,,2415,4.681710213776722
2545201,5,B000EXDS2A,"I loved the Time Tunnel when I was a child; to see the episodes again was delighted.  The quality of the reproduction supper. The acting and the special effects were in accordance with that time 1960's.

2545215,5,B000EXDS2A,"Either the original prints of this show were in amazing condition to begin with or the studio spared no expense to remaster them for this release. The video transfer is absolutely stunning and the audio is crisp and clean. It's too bad given the technology available today; the studio couldn't remaster the sound in 5.1 Dolby Digital, maybe they thought it didn't need it. In my opinion the picture is really amazing and I don't ever remember seeing this show look so good.

Season one volume two contains the final 15 episodes of this Irwin Allen classic and it remains one of my favorite TV shows of all time. From the creative mind of Irwin Allen we get to join scientists Tony Newman (James Darrin) and Doug Phillips (Robert Colbert) as they enter the Time Tunnel to prove that Project Tic Toc was indeed capable of sending humans through time and bringing them back, hopefully in one piece. Trapped in time and unable to return home because they tried to use the Time Tunnel before it was completed, the scientists now wait helplessly as they're colleagues try to get them back. Will Tony and Doug ever get back to the present or will they float in time for ever?

DVD extras include interviews with cast members, a still photo gallery, the 1970's made for TV ""Time Travelers"" movie and the unaired 2002 TV pilot episode. The bonus features this time around are a definite plus, although the footage of the 1970's ""Time Travelers"" movie is not as sharp as the 1960's episodes. As for the unaired 2002 TV pilot, it's almost an hour long and the sound is in 5.1. After watching the 2002 pilot episode I could see why the studio passed on it, it's like watching a lesser version of Stargate, only not as good.

This amazing DVD set completes the original series and is a must for all ""Time Tunnel"" fans new or old. My only complaint is that a 30 episode series took two volumes to complete when the Studio could have easily released a complete series set to begin with. Recently the complete season one of the ""Wild Wild West"" with all 28 episodes & bonus extras was released on 7 single sided discs by Paramount and definitely more affordable. I hope this review was helpful.

Towards the last shows, they tend to get less interesting, though, since the two heroes don't meet celebrities of history any more but have to deal with (cheesy) aliens.

The biggest surprise was the unaired remake. Who in the world made the decision to a) not air this and b) not continue it? It is great! And I am sure the concept would have made it in the networks. SG 1, here we come ... not :-(",1162684800,,556,3.8771929824561404
2545219,4,B000EXDS2A,"Time Tunnel Vol. 2 met my full expectations as did Vol. 1. The truly timeless classic still allows me [and now my family and neighbors] to explore history and all the sciences [such as geography, aeronautics, tsunamis, climatology, geology etc.] through these travels. Better than most modern sci-fi, TT is literally truth-based with enough novelty and narrative to please. Fancier gimmicks or effects are not needed since there is plenty of room for the essence of imagination: if I were there too...

  Actors of great skill as well as then newcomers cram the films full with quality reenactments. The only weaknesses in the series are in 2 areas: 1]not enough variety in music scores, typical in most 60's shows, so unless you love the suspense melodies as I do you'd get quite bored.  2] minimal inconsistencies that irritate such as Tony Newman's birthyear in Titanic differed from when he was in Pearl Harbor in Vol. 1.

Here, I can see they were getting short on ideas so they got more extreme & exotic in storylines. For instance, going to a planet around Canopus where Hitler was collected along with other central historical figures, aliens who came to harvest protein from the American West [grain, beef, people], a beehive type alien colony some 3 million years ago, aliens siphoning off Earth's atmosphere in 1974, etc. Never dull, always clever but I can see how ABC network cancelled the dreamy -never could be- stuff. TT would've lived 5 more seasons if they've stayed deep in the past. I wish even then the makers would've taken surveys about where to travel. They visited Gen. Custer, Lincoln, the 1836 Alamo and the War of 1812 but not Valley Forge or maybe helping to write the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution - so to be sure the founding fathers got it right! In Ancient stuff they did the Trojan horse episode being mistaken for gods from Olympus and at Jericho recruited as Joshua's spies but why not being mistaken as the 2 angels saving Lot from Sodom & Gomorrah, or getting people out of Pompeii before Vesuvius exploded as a parallel to the Krakatoa episode? It would have followed the logic of the shows I named. Maybe someday the idea of a Tunnel show will be revisited. I think ABC also killed it off because they notably avoided most civil rights and racism issues, maybe too hot to handle in 1966,7. They never dreamed of global terrorism although touching on Islamic Afghanistan issues of 1886 where they met Rudyard Kipling.

I give the DVD quality a 4 star, the series itself a 'B+', delivery an 'A' and Amazon's operating methods, including discount deal reminders an 'A'.

2545232,5,B000EXDS2A,"what a gem! The digital transfer is fantastic, image quality is better than most DVD sets out there (old series, I mean). This show is something very special. There is adventure, drama, some clever special effects for TV in those times and incredible chemistry between the cast. Some episodes are better than others (which is normal in any show) but, in general, they stood the test of time very proudly.

This is one of my favorite shows ever (along with the ""Planet Of The Apes"" TV series). Like Burke and Vernon from that show, It's a shame that Tony and Doug were doomed since the day Tony decided to go into the Tunnel to save Tic-Toc from being scrapped, because they never had the chance to get back home...

There is a gem in the extras, however, that is the unaired pilot episode of 2002. The only resemblance with the original series are the names of two of the leads: one is called Doug Phillips  (who was not involved at atll at the creation of the Tunnel - who was not made for time travel, but for hot fusion!) and they made Toni Newman a woman! Why the new series did not receive the green light to go ahead I do not know, because this pilot is really good, it shows tremendous potential, the pace is breathtaking, the productions values are incredible for a TV show.

2545234,4,B000EXDS2A,"Irwin Allen's cost-consciousness gets a workout in the second half of this compilation of episodes from his single-season science fiction adventure.  Not only did the show continue its use of stock footage from earlier theatrical films, there was an over-utilization of Bernard Herrmann music, especially themes/melodies from ""Garden of Evil"" and the classic ""The Day the Earth Stood Still.""

Watching the episodes back to back, one realizes how frequently a group of actors appeared in that single season.  Though they would be assaying different roles, actors John Crawford, John Hoyt, Kevin Hagen, Vitina Marcus, Vincent Beck, Malachi Throne, Michael Ansara, Rhodes Reason, and Lawrence Montaigne would repeatedly find themselves, like stars James Darren (""Tony"") and Robert Colbert (""Doug""), ""trapped in the annals of time.""  In addition to this group, the following actors, who would be featured in other Allen productions, would be seen: Abraham Sofaer, Victor Jory (a standout in ""The Pirates of Devil's Island""), future Oscar winner Robert Duvall, Arthur Batanides, Regis Toomey, Ronald Long, and Lew Gallo.

Heather Young is featured in the final episode and would later go on to appear as one of the stars of Allen's ""Land of the Giants"".  The ever-popular Del Monroe (""Kowalski"" from ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"") appears in one episode, also.

The sharp eye will notice some of the same set pieces from Allen's other television shows: the ""computers"" and other flashing gizmos, ray guns, and that ever present silver ALIEN makeup.

As far as the ""extras"" go, they are a curious lot.  The unaired fifty-minute 2002 pilot owes about as much to its premise to the original series as it does to the Sci-fi Channel's popular ""Stargate SG-1"" show. However, it's a fairly good pilot and should have fit well on the Sci-Fi Channel's schedule.

And Allen's attempt to revive the concept with his own pilot, ""The Time Travelers"" benefits solely from the casting of Groom and Richard Basehart (""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"").

If one has seen the television special ""The Fantasy Film Worlds of Irwin Allen,"" the cast interviews offer nothing new.

As has been noticed by others, the second half of the season was not as strong as the first but there is one notable observation: the best show from this half (""Kill Two by Two"") parallels the best from the first half (""The Day the Sky Fell In"").  Both shows find Doug and Tony in World War II situations and feature standout performances from both actors, along with the respective guest stars (Linden Child's in the latter and Mako and Phillip Ahn in the former), and writing that was superior to the other installments in the series. Coincidentally, one of the best from Allen's other series (""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"") dealt with survivors of World War II: ""And Five of Us are Left"".

Perhaps, if more of the episodes had been of their caliber, the pair would've been crossing time a little longer than one season.

And Lee Meriwhether (""Ann"") may have gotten to wear something besides that godawful green blouse!

Still, the set comes recommended as an affordable entertainment.",1155945600,6,3149,5.003831417624521
2545235,3,B000EXDS2A,"This second set of 15 episodes is the one to get if you enjoy Time Tunnel for its unintentional comedy value.

What were those writers smoking?). Here too are the many episodes which lamely attempted to mix aliens from space with period drama, including ""Raiders from Outer Space"" and the laugh-out-loud ""Visitors From Beyond The Stars.""

On the bright side, this set also has ""Kill Two by Two,"" one of the few episodes of the series that actually works, thanks to an intriguing script and a wildly intense performance by the late Mako.

However,there are too many positive aspects about the TIME TUNNEL to call it a dud. After all,it had a great concept to begin with,a great cast of actors and supporting actors and many surprizes happening in and ouside the tunnel to keep our interest until the end.

The acting and writing are classic campy 60's stuff, but at least they did a good job of taking historical events and personalizing them.

2545247,2,B000EXDS2A,"I'm not a fan of THE TIME TUNNEL and probably won't watch the episodes in this set. I bought it for the two unsold revival pilots that are included -- the unaired, 2002 hour-long THE TIME TUNNEL ""reimagining"" for Fox (which was flawed but interesting nonetheless) and the 1976 two-hour movie TIME TRAVELERS (which was awful in every way).  The story for TIME TRAVELERS was written by Rod Serling, but I can't imagine that any of his work remained in the execrable final product. There wasn't hint of his intelligence, wit or characterization in the script.

THE TIME TUNNEL set has a couple of nice extras but no effort is made to present them in any sort of context or with any kind of flair. The whole set feels perfunctory, slapped together with no imagination, creativity or enthusiasm. Which is, of course, the complete opposite of the DVD sets put together by Paul Brownfield...like THE WILD WILD WEST, GUNSMOKE, and THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW.",1150070400,3,946,4.7272727272727275

I would have like to have had one total volume of the cartoon Star Wars :Clone Wars too. However neither  did not come to pass. I did get Tunnel volume one, see my review if you want to know what I thought of it

For the fans of Encore movie channel or Sci-Fi channel, we seen these episodes of Time Tunnel  before. If someone say why put this on DVD. I say SO WHAT, it is better than the numberous Law and Orders, CSIs and its clones, and other drek currently out there. I would rather watch the quality  Irwin Allen put in his weekly TV shows than most other stuff on TV today. Time Tunnel is no acception

Now let me get off my soapbox on the current state of TV out there and focus on the DVD set at hand. Is this set worth your money? For me, I would say YES...The story were well thought out. The actors did not over play the SF like some shows do. The show is over 40 years old and hold up well- both in content and in acting.  Irwin Allen always put the money into his work whether TV or movies (the 1970 version of the Poseidon Adventure is a good example). Time Tunnel, even if it was a one season wonder was advance for its day

Who cares if the bumper of TIME TUNNEL IN COLOR or THIS SHOE BROUGHT TO YOU BY?...To me,  that takes away from the show at hand

Do I dislike the divided season packaging? YES! However I bought into the concept  when I bought ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" volume 1 of season 1. I will again when Volume one of Commander and Chief volume one comes out. This seems to be the wave of the future

The extras are good. An interview with the cast about tunnel. The TV movie with Sam Groom that tried to remake the show and 2002 promo presenation of a possible Tunnel redo (which never came to pass)are good extras on this volume. I would have love an audio commentary on an episode, however that didn't come to pass--for shame!

NOW the question on my mind is when is the Invaders or  Land of the Giants coming?

While the show jumped the shark fairly early in its run on TV I suspect it had more to do with creative exhaustion and the exhausting production schedule for the show. Many of Allen's shows began well but many of them (such as ""Voyage to The Bottom of The Sea"" or ""Lost in Space"") would become increasingly silly as the seasons progressed. Luckily ""The Time Tunnel"" avoided this curse for the most part although the second half of the season isn't quite as strong as the first half.

Once again we get a very nice transfer from Fox. Colors are bright images are crisp with occasional soft spots evident due to the age of the master materials but on the whole excellent. Scratches and other analog artifacts due to damage to the original elements are the most common of the flaws evident. The mono sound comes across with nice presence. The 70's TV movie looks the worst of the lot here. The color has faded, there are a fair amount of analog artifacts (scratches, etc.) and the picture is soft throughout. and like the series is an artifact of the time but a fun one that looks good (although not quite as good as the series surprisingly). The 2002 pilot looks the best (not surprising) with only a bit of edge enhancement but otherwise looks excellent with bold colors and sharp images as well as a nice 2.0 mix.

The special features included here rival those of the first set. We get the 2002 pilot for a remake of the show. The show clearly had potential and it's a pity that it wasn't picked up or that the network didn't ask for changes to make it more viable. Luckily the hour pilot works as a self contained update with a conclusion and without loose ends. It has a fascinating concept (time storms randomly pick up and deposit people in the wrong times changing the flow of history. It's the team's mission to put things right again and change back the timestream. Those that are working on the project near the Time Tunnel core are shielded from the changes in history and thus know about them while others do not).

The TV movie/pilot ""Time Travelers"" is another matter entirely. Dr. Clint Earnshaw (Sam Groom) tries to track down the cause of ""Wood fever"" a new pathogen that is striking down visitors to New Orleans Mardi Gras. Earnshaw has tried to contain the virus and discover a cure. He knows that Dr. Amos Cummings (Richard Basehart) discovered what looks like a cure 100 years before in Chicago. Unfortunately Dr. Cummings' notes were destroyed in the great Chicago Fire and Cummings killed. Former astronaut Jeff Adams (Tom Halick) recruits Earnshaw to go back in time and retrieve those notes thus saving everyone in the present day and preventing an outbreak that could cripple our nation.

Working from a story by Rod Serling and directed by ""Star Trek"" vet Alexander Singer I would have expected the TV movie to be better. The premise is better than the execution. The effects are cheesy especially when compared to the deluxe visual effects from the pilot episode for ""The Time Tunnel"". The writing (the final script was not by Serling but TV vet Jackson Gillis) is stilted and sounds like it was written by an inexperienced writer (it wasn't) with the characters pointing out the obvious and too much time spent explaining the same things over and over again like the main characters are as dense as blocks of wood when, in fact, they're supposed to be bright guys. Filled with bad acting (although Allen's ""Voyage"" favorite Richard Basehart makes the most of his limited time on screen), it's not a surprise that the TV movie did not result in a series. Nevertheless fans who appreciate old TV movies will be happy to have this movie on DVD.

We also get vintage interviews with actors Darren, Colbert, Bissel and Meriwether discussing the show. Finally there's a fine image gallery with stills from the show although there aren't any more home movies from Allen's vault nor is there a featurette on the production of the show and a discussion about why Allen allowed the series to be cancelled. There are no commentary tracks either.

Although the second half of the only season of ""The Time Tunnel"" had a higher cheese level than the first 15 episode there were still enough quality episodes to make the second half of the worthwhile. The extras are the real attraction though for fans who collect vintage TV movies with ""Time Travelers"" added as an extra as well as interviews. To top it off Fox generously has included the failed pilot for a 2002 revival which is pretty good overall although I could see where the show might have needed some tweaking that could have improved its success. Image and sound are exceptionally good for the series and the pilot looks great. The TV movie has faded and hasn't been restored although it doesn't look as bad as some transfers of vintage TV movies (although not as good as the best I've seen ""The Night Stalker""/""The Night Strangler"" MGM release of a couple years back). Overall fans will want to pick this up to complete their set. With guest stars like Robert Duvall and fun plots fans of 60's sci-fi and drama will have a good time tripping back in time with Doug and Tony.

2545250,4,B000EXDS2A,"A fun, if hokey, premise (as if all of Irwin Allen's series' are), but an enjoyable romp into history past.  Implausible?  Yes, but half of the sci-fi that is imaginative and entertaining on TV is too. The leads, Robert Colbert and James Darren are appealing and credible. Supporting cast is also equally serious in their roles--determined Whit Bissel, straight from ""I Was a Teenage Werewolf,"" and a pretty but efficient Lee Meriwether. The series seems to be inspired by a little known film starring Vincent Price and Ronald Colman, ""The Story of Mankind"" (1957), based on the work of now long-deceased historian, Heinrick von Loon. Unfortunately, for Price and Colman, ""The Story of Mankind"" is a movie they would rather forget earning a ""Golden Turkey Award"" from the Medved brothers! Nonetheless, the series makes good use of stock footage from 20th Century Fox's vaults and boasts a pretty impressive guest cast. While the series is indeed interesting and worth watching, some of the episodes are rather silly and remind the casual viewer of the lesser episodes of ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" and ""Lost in Space"" (""The Great Vegetable Rebellion""--oh, my!) that one would rather forget. I would prefer purchasing Irwin Allen's ""Land of the Giants"" or the superb, 'The Invaders"" with Roy Thinnes. Of course, Time Tunnel doesn't have the gravitas of Star Trek or the Twilight Zone, but the Time Tunnel is an nostalgic look at the sci-fi that proliferated the airwaves during the '60's.",1149724800,,1494,4.995983935742972

I absolutely love this show and would give it 5-stars and I purchased BOTH Volumes in 2006..... and enjoyed watching all episodes and the quality was good..... Yesterday I went back to Volume 2 set and discovered to my dismay that the disks have deteriorated (according to another reviewer on here it is the glue) and one side of each of the double-sided disks is UNREADABLE.

I returned to Amazon to see if I could buy again.... I notice that the Volume 1 is available new at a low price (these have not deteriorated).... the Volume 2 is only available used at a very high price..... BUT even if I was tempted to pay higher price for another set of good disks.... there is no guarantee they will not deteriorate shortly thereafter..... it is a known problem with this Volume 2..... and the risk is very high that ultimately ALL these disks will have to be thrown away.",1511049600,3,916,4.5120481927710845

8115565,1,B000EXDS2A,"I purchased this set in 2006. I have used it lightly over the years. For content I give it 5-stars. But I found today, in opening the set again, that the DVDs have become damaged due to the glue used in the manufacturing process so that now some of the discs are unreadable. These DVDs were made by gluing two DVD5's together so that there is no label on the disc, just flip it over to see the other side. So now one side is readable and the other side is not readable. Shame on the manufacturers of this classic set for selecting such low quality materials. So if you plan to buy this set, ask the seller to visually inspect each disc to make sure your set is readable. I assume that no new sets are being manufactured, so that all the sets that are currently available were made pre-2006.",1500422400,,790,4.23841059602649
