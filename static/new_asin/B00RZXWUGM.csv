6938028,2,B00RZXWUGM,"too bad, it had great potential but I felt that the approach to the story got sidetracked; the ida of making a documentary about the mysterious seclusion of an up and coming indie horror director was fine but I didn't think B.J. Hendricks who played the documentarist was well cast.

Thanks to Tom Sizemore, it starts out well enough and gives one a believable insight to the cut throat Hollywood film making process and laying the foundation for the premise of the story, however, it gets bogged down with Ian Hutton hitting the bottle and (I forget which actress plays the possessed actress, forgive me) spending too much time being secretive and crazy about what really transpired on the set of the last and allegedly greatest film by Chas. Buckwald and the whereabouts of this mysterious film.

Buckwald finally consents to give the documentarist the film but the ""deal with this devil"" footage is weak and unconvincing.
We're left with an unsatisfying ending not really knowing what will ultimately become of Buckwald or his demon besotted ex actress; I believe we are left to assume this is gong to be the wretched hand wringing Richard Burton Faustian end for Buckwald and the poor actress will end up looking like Liz Taylor in ribbons of Reynolds aluminum wrap. (yes, for those of you who are too young to remember, that's how they actually cast and costumed Liz as Helen of Troy opposite Burton.)

the documentarist is watching the faustian film and we see that he is being possessed by the cinematic dark spirit; not unlike ""Ringu"" (The Ring).
too much is conveniently assumed and there are too many loose ends.
This could have been a truly frightening film had it been in more capable hands.",1430265600,4,1703,4.785714285714286

8696654,4,B00RZXWUGM,"Given that the horror genre is not multi-million-mega budget most of the time, this followed typical.  However, it was a cleaver and unique plot and the ending climax made the movie worth watching.  To get their theme they had to make the middle of the movie drag a bit to build what was being hidden.  I was entertained in an economy way.  ""Auteur"" seems fitting as the movie was a persona/inner vision of the main character in a bizarre sort of way.",1432598400,,451,4.463414634146342
8696655,5,B00RZXWUGM,"loved it! great story and idea, like the concept and the film. Some parts may need work but I also am not trying to compare it to a multi billion dollar box office big screen movie. This looks like a step up from a B movie by far, but missing the BIG budget. I still loved it and the effects and thriller suspenseful parts were cool. I recommend it for anyone who loves horror or thrillers or wants to see a new movie.",1432339200,2,418,4.048192771084337
8696656,2,B00RZXWUGM,"Overall Auteur fails to impress. The story is strong enough and the talent should have been there to really sell this nightmare. The execution of the story arc falters consistently through the first half of the film and give us more of the same ole, same ole in found footage gimmickry. The last act does allow the film to rebound somewhat, especially when during the second half what seemed a train wreck miraculously rights itself enough to make it watchable. Not enough to save the film completely or forgive the first half- but whatev. The effects and soundtrack work, the supernatural element and story concept work. Basically check Auteur out but in order to not be disappointed you need to set through some really bad material to feel okay with watching this movie.

The special effects are a blend of low budget practicality and expected supernatural CGI inserts. The supernatural aspects are classic, and part of what makes Auteur watchable and at moments entertaining. The possessed and pathetic soul is a big draw in horror- always. The horror elements are sparse, most taking place in the last act of the mockumentary. The practical effects are more off  camera suggestive insights that make indie, stripped-down projects work. The blood and gore is non-existent but the effect is very much prominent in Auteur. The soundtrack and effects are more of the same expected sounds that build the suspense, help the ""emotionality"" of it all, and ultimately bore the viewer until that magical third act when it seems everything about the film and intended vision really come alive.",1431216000,3,1586,4.981132075471698
