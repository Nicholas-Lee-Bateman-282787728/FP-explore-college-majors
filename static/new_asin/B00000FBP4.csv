7907809,4,B00000FBP4,Yes the Roaring Glorys Warbird Series is a blast. The F6F Hellcat is a great fighter in history and as a ww2 buff a thrill to see. Would just like to thank pilot Steve Hinton for sharing his knowlage and experence of the old birds. The Sound of these radial engines are almost like being live. What a thrill. Turn up the volume and lets go flying!,1367107200,,347,4.1940298507462686
7907810,5,B00000FBP4,"The pilot does a good job expelling and demonstrating the use of this airplane. Short of catching a ride in one, watching this film is a fun ride that is educational, especially for my son.",1366588800,,189,4.428571428571429
7907811,3,B00000FBP4,"Hellcat enthusiast's will sit through the poor narration, which sounds like it is read from a script too fast and without emotion, to gather the technical information and watch some great footage of the Hellcat in  action.
The restored ""31"" is featured throughout the video  often mixed with some excellent original WWII film.
First half of the  video is presented as a technical walk-around of the aircraft and a short  flight.
WWII footage is featured in the second half through a short  drama, based on a historical event.",945993600,2,525,4.920454545454546
