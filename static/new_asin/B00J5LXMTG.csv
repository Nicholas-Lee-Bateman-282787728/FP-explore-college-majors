6335969,4,B00J5LXMTG,"This well-received 2013 documentary by Frank Pavich explores the ups and downs of director Alejando Jodorowsky's failed adaptation of Dune in 1975.  It's a fascinating ""What If?"" story that doubles as a look behind-the-scenes and a brief glimpse at what might have been.  Featured participants include Jodorowsky (84 at the time of filming, and as charismatic as ever), artist Chris Foss, artist H.R. Giger and FX supervisor Dan O'Bannon (both later famous for ""Alien""), producers Michel Seydoux and Jean-Paul Gibon, Jodorowsky's son Brontis (who also acted in ""El Topo"") and more.  Fascinating stories are told, great art is shared and we see exactly where everything went off the rails.  You'll hear about the involvement of Mick Jagger, Orson Welles and Salvador Dali, as well as failed studio pitches and, of course, the influence on modern sci-fi.  It's a really well-done documentary from start to finish, no matter if you're familiar with ""Dune"" and Jodorowsky or not.

I received an advance screener from Sony for a review published separately at DVD Talk, which you can look up if you're so inclined.  Sony's done a good job on this disc: the A/V presentation is terrific and the bonus features, though limited, are interesting.  They include over 45 minutes' worth of deleted scenes from the film and the original trailer, which brings the total amount of content to just under 2.5 hours.  Sure, it's more than a little expensive, but this is a fine disc and one well worth looking out for.",1403740800,27,1500,4.991967871485944

6335971,4,B00J5LXMTG,"""Jodorowsky's Dune"" (2013 release from France; 90 min.) brings the background story on what is referred to as possibly the greatest movie never made, the adaptation of the science fiction book ""Dune"" by ""high art"" director Alejandro Jodorowsky. As the documentary opens, we get a quick crash course of Jodorowsky's earlier work, including experimental theater in Mexico in the early 60s and a couple of cult movies (""El Topo"", ""The Holy Mountain"") in the early 70s that did surprisingly well in Europe. So Jodorowsky gets the opportunity from a French producer to assemble a team of ""warriors"", as he calls them, to make his vision of Dune into a visual reality. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, if you are a movie enthusiast, you are in for a finger-lickin' good time, honestly! Credit for that goes of course to director Frank Pavich, but let's be honest: he couldn't have had a more enjoyable subject than Alejandro Jodorowsky, who turns out to be a master story teller. The way he convinces people, one after another, to give their cooperation to the movie, is just priceless (one of the best stories involves the movie makers making a trip to London to ask Pink Floyd to provide the soundtrack--just watch!). Jodorowsky is now in his mid-80s but he looks about 20 or 30 years younger, and most importantly, he remains as feisty and as ambitious as ever. There is a nice soundtrack to the movie, by Kurt Stenzel (of the band SpacEKraft).

I had seen the trailer for this movie a number of times in recent weeks, and this was for me once of the most anticipated releases so far in 2014. The movie opened last month at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I went to see it right away. The early evening screening I saw this at was very well attended, I'm happy to say. If you are in the mood for a top notch documentary that gives the spotlight to a creative genius who could've/should've brought Dune to the big screen the right way, by all means see this. ""Jodorowsky's Dune"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1401235200,75,2145,4.671957671957672
6335972,4,B00J5LXMTG,"Maybe it wouldn't have been Dune, but it would have been incredible. The stable of talent Jodorowsky had lined up is beyond belief: H.R. Giger (from before he did Alien), Salvador Dali, Moebius (the comic artist), Orson Welles, and so many more I can't keep track of them all. It was a grand if quixotic adventure to attempt anything like that ...

... and it ultimately failed. Perhaps the would-be backers shied at the erratic reputations of some of the participants, perhaps Jodo's vision was too far ahead of its time (or theirs), perhaps, well a lot of things. Many of those who would have been involved have passed away, and the others apparently weren't consulted for this movie, so we might never know. (C'mon, it's about how great Dune would have been, not why it wasn't.)

Even today, decades later, Jodorowsky's enthusiasm for this would-have-been incredible pageant remains undimmed. And, even if the movie he envisioned never came to pass, lots of movies did. The team he assembled went their ways, but many of them went on to other great things, often with each other. Perhaps Jodo's contribution was to connect these other great talents, rather than use them himself. One can only wonder.

6336030,5,B00J5LXMTG,"This is basically the story of the greatest movie never made. He would have had Mick Jagger, Orson Wells, David Carradine and Salvador Dali all playing the leads in Dune with Pink Floyd as the soundtrack. It either would have been terrible, like The Who's Tommy, or sheer brilliance, like 2001; A Space Odyssey. Jodorowsky's Dune, however, as this documentary shows, would have been completely unworkable for Hollywood back in the mid 1970's. He wouldn't back down on numerous issues the studios had, including the 6 hour running time and the 15 million dollar budget, which back in the 70's was a lot.
This documentary is Jodorowsky and the men who tried to make Dune looking back and commenting and describing the process and it's fascinating. From how he tortured his son into 6 hour training periods, 6 days a week to ""become"" the character of Paul for 2 years to how he finessed the 400 pound Orson Welles to play the character of the Baron by promising to hire his favorite French chef to cater his meals on set.  It's absolutely mesmerizing for the Jodorowsky fan, which I am. Required viewing. Of course, in the end, after all the shucking and jiving, the millions spent on traveling the world scouring for talent, the hours and hours spent creating the story board, Hollywood canceled the whole thing and then went on to borrow his ideas for films like Star Wars, Contact and Prometheus. And then, of course, we wouldn't even have Alien if it wasn't for Jodorowsky's Dune. So God bless him.
I will never, ever again be afraid to fail after seeing this film and that is it's message, in the end.",1499126400,2,1603,4.6643109540636045

6336063,4,B00J5LXMTG,"Part of me is glad this film wasn't made, because it's obvious that Jodorowsky had no interest in being faithful to the plot of the novel Dune (he admitted at one point that he was ""raping Frank Herbert""). Instead he wanted to explore the same themes he had already expressed in El Topo and The Holy Mountain. The additional gruesome violence would have been a turn-off, which is the reason I ultimately grew tired of El Topo.

Still, Jodorowsky's artistic enthusiasm is fun to watch, and that storyboard book is amazing. Obviously it influenced other filmmakers, and if you're a fan of documentaries about film-making, you will probably enjoy this.",1494720000,2,649,4.9

One can only imagine what the result would have been had Jodorowsky got his funding. Dali as the Padishah Emperor would have been worth seeing . . . once.",1493596800,,541,4.587628865979381

6336066,3,B00J5LXMTG,"This is an interesting documentary about a failed film project that ended up very influential after the fact.

The 1970s were a crazy time and Jodorowsky was a crazy person. At the time he worked on Dune, he was heavy into drugs and especially LSD. Like many people at that time, he thought LSD had transformed him into a enlightened being and wanted to share that experience with the rest of the world. He was surrounded by people who shared his habits and mutually agreed that they were all evolved humans. It was all stupid in retrospect, but was a product of a crazy time.

Jodorowsky was introduced to the book ""Dune"". Like many at that time, he read the first book and came up with his own really narrow reading of it. A superficial reading of Dune was that it was all about liberation and enlightenment through drugs. That taking drugs and falling into mysticism would allow a utopian revolution led by peasents to succeed against a modern technological society. Vietnam analogies can be found in it. There are ecology ideas that can be taken out of it. People also can extract alot from the metaphor of the ""world"" being a desert which can be transformed by the revolution into a green paradise.

This actual book (or books) has a much more complicated message, but Jodorowsky's narrow reading found a message that is was tune with his own ideas of social and intellectual transformation through LSD use.

Jodorowsky then blew through 2 million dollars of pre-production money for his film. From the film, you can tell alot of that money was spent on his own lifestyle and travel budget. It certainly didn't seem to be going to the people working with him. Where his talent showed through is that he was able to assemble an extraordinary collection of visual designers to work with him. He had Jean Giraud (Moebius), Giger, and Dan O'Bannon among others. The team he put together put together a totally comprehesive preproduction package. From what is seen in the film, that part of the effort was absolutely first-class. But in other areas, the problems with the film as a project are very obvious.

Jodorowsky's casting choices were mostly self-destructive. The first bad choice was putting his own son into the lead role. He then tended toward people who were either not really actors or were well known in that era for being impossible to work with. He courted salvador dali and predictably Dali's interest was in getting the most money for the least work plus a big role for his female companion. He bought lots of expensive meals for Orson Welles and did drugs with david carradine. It would be a great case of the people (aside from his son) were sober and motivated. But I don't think any of them really were.

He then went shopping for money in Hollywood for production. But for the casting, his reputation as a director and his insistence on a 14 hour long film, he might have gotten the money. But the project collapsed instead.

While the film was interesting as a design project, I don't think the film if had been made would have been good. I think it would have ended up looking like the campy 1980 version of flash gordon. Which is ironic because Flash Gordon (1980) is one of the things the film points to in terms of its influence. The people putting the documentary together didn't seem to know the difference between good films this work had an influence on (Alien, Star Wars) and bad films it influenced (Flash Gordon, Masters of the Universe). Alot of the design for Dune was, in my opinion, fatally campy looking. They also point to several people involved being lazy and shamelessly recycling work done for Dune into other films. There is little positive I would say about Giger pulling out designs he did in 1973 for Dune and presenting them as work to Ridley Scott for his recent film ""Prometheus"". I would call that lazy and unprofessional actually (and personally disappointing).

The worst part of the documentary is where Jodorowsy talks about raping (his concept)  the Dune novel. It was weird and disturbing to listen to someone talk about a ""rape"" based on ""love"" in the way he does. He can be forgiven I guess because he is in his 80s, but the documentary director should absolutely have left all that out.

I came away from the documentary thinking highly of the work they did even thought this stuff isn't my cup of tea and if it had been my choice, I would never have given them money to the film. Someone should take their preproduction work and make an animated film (or series) based on the storyboards and design work. The whole work seems perfect for HBO/Netflix/Amazon to pick up as a series. If done the right way, the material could appeal to the same audience that loves game of thrones. Though working with Jodorowsky would (to say the least) not be easy.",1488153600,3,4810,4.661556603773585

6336075,3,B00J5LXMTG,"A very strange documentary about a very strange project.

I love Dune. It is my favorite science fiction book of all time. I even appreciate the David Lynch film for what it is, especially having grown up in the 1980s. The basic idea of a Jodorowsky Dune is intriguing, but only as an idea and as a gathering of some of the best creative minds at the time. As the documentary goes on, several things about this project become clear:

1. That almost no one associated with this project ever actually read Dune, and thus they get the entire point of the novel wrong, and would've gotten it wrong in the movie.

2. That Jodorowsky talked a lot about ""Changing the World"" ""Changing Consciousness"" ""Enlightenment"" but apparently either had no idea what this so-called Enlightenment was or didn't have any interest in telling anyone. ""This movie would have changed the world!"" Changed the world into what? He doesn't seem to know. Change human consciousness into what? Again, Jodorowsky has no idea. So basically, the whole documentary comes across as a guy who was really, really, REALLY into LSD, heard about a book where a drug called Spice exists, and then wanted to make a movie about drugs expanding consciousness.

But, see, Jodorowsky and company never actually read the book. So they have ZERO idea what Spice does or what its possibilities are or what the consequences of its use are. They appear to have just been caught up in 1970s drug culture and wanted to make a movie about drugs. And like so many people, projects, and ideas that were caught up in 1970s drug culture, ultimately, they had no message at all. Just ""Take this drug and you'll see cool stuff.""

That's nice. What happens after that? Well, they don't know. Nor do they care at all.

Dune was ""Message fiction"" that never really hit you over the head with the messages about education, psychology, ecology, the role of religion in society, fate vs free will, power and responsibility. Jodorosky and his project seem very, very shallow by comparison, ultimately being, as he states in the very beginning of the documentary, ""I wanted to make a movie about LSD that the audience didn't have to be on LSD to watch.""

That's basically it. Jodorowsky wanted you to see lots of colors and hear lots of cool sounds and somehow all of that would magically translate into ""Changing human consciousness."" He comes across as pretty much the least self-aware person to have ever existed with no morals, values, judgment, or ideas that would capture anyone's attention beyond, ""Oh, hey cool pirate ship."" I'm not saying people need to have morals or values that match mine, but if you don't have ANYTHING, then you don't have a message....or, apparently, a movie.

Not actually hard to see why Hollywood passed on his involvement in the project.",1483920000,9,2804,4.778925619834711

It is the portrait of a true creator, taken with his vision to an obsessive level to see his unique version of Dune come to fruition. The story, concepts, art, and overall vibe, however, were way too weird for Hollywood and Jodorwskis Dune became the greatest science fiction movie never made.

Just a short list of the participants Jodorowski assembled tells you much about the movies gestalt: David Carradine, Orson Welles, Salvador Dali, Mick Jagger, Jean Moebius Giruad, H.R. Giger, Dan OBannon, Pink Floyd, and Magma.

Much more than an autopsy on how the feature was developed, and why it failed to be made, the film is a love letter to audacious creativity, the drive to see ones vision come to fruition, and an almost messianic fervor to get the right people involved because of their own creative gifts. Central to the documentary is the filmmakers 2010 interview with Jodorowski, madman or genius, specifically for the film. The guy is whacked. I loved him.

Most interestingly is the book they finished, all the concept art, costuming, character design, and story boards, which the film lovingly shows off during the feature. You have to see it to believe it.

I don't want to give anything more away; as practitioners or lovers of film, literature, or art, or anyone who liked Dune, I leave it to the viewer to bring their own perspective--but expect to have your mind blown. Its on Blu-Ray and cost me less than a couple stiff drinks. I cant recommend Jodorowskis Dune highly enough.",1470441600,2,1684,4.857142857142857

I'd heard stories about ""the failed movie before the Lynch movie"", but never dug into the details.  This movie clocks in at 90 minutes and think that's just about the perfect length.  You get to see and hear all kinds of crazy takes on Herbert's masterpiece.  I honestly don't think I would have enjoyed the movie if it had been produced, but that was a very different time, and Jodorwsky definitely had a unique take of the story.  He was deliberately changing the plot to make the movie his own interpretation of the novel.

One thing that was genius was getting H.R. Giger to design the visual theme of House Harkonnen.  Herbert sets Harkonnens up as a morally corrupt and vile society, where a single scene describes slavery, attempted patricide and directly implied deviant acts against children.  Lynch demonstrated their corruption through physical deformity and a complete and blatant disregard for human life.  I think Giger's visual style was an ideal selection to represent the inhumanity of the Harkonnens.",1466726400,3,1098,4.956284153005464

6336276,4,B00J5LXMTG,"I have mixed feelings on this documentary. Most of it talks about the cinematic history of Alejandro Jodorowsky and mainly features interviews with the director himself. The main focus for most of the time is on how he came to take on the project of adapting the Sci-Fi book ""Dune"" (one of my all time favorites, hence the interest in this documentary.) It covers how he came to work with Moebius, HR Geiger and Chris Foss - and Jodorowsky's obsession with pulling in celebrities of his time (Salvador Dali, Mick Jagger, etc) into the film as well. Before watching this, I knew nothing of Jodorowsky himself, was very familiar with Geiger from the Alien franchise, knew a limited amount about Chriss Foss from his reputation for Sci-Fi book artwork, and was fairly familiar with Moebuis from Heavy Metal.

As I was watching though this, I was interested but the interviews with the director went on a little too much and it was a bit hard to stay engaged with his over exuberant extolling of his concepts for the film, art direction, concept art, and actors - it all seemed like a stretch and frankly didn't really connect with me.

But - at the end of the documentary, it shifts gears to talk about how many of those ideas I didn't connect with - coming from the directory's own manic, confusing though enjoyable explanations - were later adopted into so many different movies. And it's not as simple as ""HR Geiger because famous for Alien.."", it shows how specific shots and sequences Jodorowsky had visualized in his own mind and story boarded later were adopted almost frame for frame by other directors in other movies. It made me realize, to a degree, why I never ended up an artistic field, and gave me an vastly increased respect for Jodorowsky, Geiger, Foss, and Moebius. It's not something I would watch twice, but if you are interested in any of the main players in the documentary, or the Dune books, I'd strongly recommend to give it a watch!",1452988800,19,1955,4.663768115942029

He even calls it his right as a director to ""rape"" the original material.  The end of his version would have had Paul's throat cut and then live on as some sort of group consciousness in the Fremen.  This concept isn't too far gone from Leto's final death in the sequel books, but I think it would have ruined Dune.  Apparently I am the only one who liked Lynch's Dune.  If this movie had been made I imagine it as a cross between 5th Element and Alien.  Most of the ideas that would have gone into this movie made it into other projects, especially Jodorowski's Incal and Metabarons.  At the end of the day, I think it is for the best.  If Jodorowski had been less demanding this movie might have actually been made and it could have been judged by its own merit.  Its not hard to see why it wasn't, with Jodorowski foolishly insisting on 15+ hr movie time.  That and the movie execs were probably terrified that he would have Paul poop gold at the end or fly off into the air on a burning giraffe.",1448409600,,1163,4.240909090909091

6336387,1,B00J5LXMTG,"This is presented as a documentary about a movie that was never made back in the mid-1970s.  What you learn from watching is that the drug-fueled, narcissistic mind of Jodorowsky was never concerned with the plot or themes of the Frank Herbert novel, Dune.  It's characters were merely vague inspiration for some visually oriented, pseudo-spiritual masterpiece he intended to produce using pop icons as actors and second-rate technicians as crew.  He refers to these as his ""spiritual warriors"" as if he's some sort of messianic filmmaker.  His plan also involved casting his much too young 12-year-old son as the main character, Paul, after subjecting the boy to a brutal regimen of martial arts training.  Being a huge fan of the novel and having enjoyed the other two movie productions, despite their flaws, I don't feel the least bit deprived that this maniac never saw his vision to fruition because no one in his right mind would bankroll it.

There are some aspects of Jodorowsky's vision that impressed me, and some stylistic choices that would have been interesting to witness...but the end that he planned would have been enough to ruin the movie for me.

6336412,5,B00J5LXMTG,"When the film version of 'DUNE' came out in 1984, I read a cover article on it in Cinefantastique magazine. In the article was a mention of a little known director (to me, at the time), who had made an attempt to make a film based on Frank Herbert's epic science fiction novel 'Dune', back in the heady days of the 1970's. There was little information given in the article on Jodorowsky's film, and this was decades before one could Google anything up, so I just forgot about it... Until now.
  I am so frackin' grateful to the director Frank Pavich, to have made this extremely informative, well-researched and entertaining documentary film.
It totally fills in all the blanks about what a monumental task and effort that Jodorowsky went through to make a film of 'Dune' from his own very unique and spiritualistic vision. And this film also scores on another point. This doc is a real wake-up call to how short the film 'business' today falls (flat?) ...short, in making anything so highly visionary as what 'Jodo' was trying to do. Though, like most directors, he already 'saw' the film made, in his head, but what a sad thing that the many fans of 'Dune' won't see it on the big screen... But this film does make your mouth water, imagining how it could have looked with much fine animation sequences, based directly on the illustrations and script from Jodo's big 'Dune Book', of which only 2 copies still exist today?
  Maybe his Dune would have changed a lot of what is in Herbert's original novel, and most likely Herbert would have hated it. I can only guess at that, as Herbert passed away in 1985 or so, and his son Brian Herbert, who took over the Dune-i-verse with Kevin J. Anderson (the unending series of new Dune books) was noticeably absent from this documentary. I don't even know if he declined to be in it (this is not ever stated in film).
  In the end, this film is a great look at the painstaking process of great film-making... and of a highly original thinker and film director, who may be equal parts genius and total madman!",1428105600,2,2051,4.559782608695652

6336423,5,B00J5LXMTG,"It opens with a long vanity shot of a mans career, along shelf upon shelf, stack upon stack of paperbacks, hardbacks, VHS sleeves, art collections, a staggering amount of accumulated works to zoom into a massive tome printed with the word DUNE.

It is a marathon session of in which various personalities, including the man himself, builds up Alejandro Jodorowsky to megalomaniac proportions. You boggle at what seems like an enormous display of ego-stroking. Jodorowskys madness is evident, in these bloodshot eyes, heart-rending gesticulations. He has a vision of Dune, written by Frank Herbert. Given carte blanche, he goes on to whip up an astonishing dream team of creative geniuses, all of whom he claims came to him as if by divine whim. Although you're impressed, you determine hes quite mad.

First he gets Moebius, who he uses like a movie camera to force his vision into the world. A massive storyboard with precise camera directions and unparalleled detail emerges. David Carradine signs on as the Duke Leto. Jodorowskys own son was cast as Paul Atreides, and lived the life of Paul Atreides as Jodorowsky put him through a half decade of a comprehensive martial arts training. He convinced Dali to play the mad emperor. And the icing on the cake was the corpulent wine-sodden Orson Welles, to play a fat, naked Baron Harkonnen glittering with gaudy rhinestones and cotton-candy puff coiffures. HR Giger was aboard, Dan O Bannon was aboard. Jodorowsky convinced the artists to all to move in the rented castle designated for the creation of Dune. They all came to him in accidental encounters, and were imprisoned by his vision. My God, the mans madder than I thought, you think.

Then they show the opening shot, using the pictures from the storyboard. It was one of the best things Ive seen. You start to think maybe Jodorowsky wasn't stroking his ego, but merely stating the truth. Theres this vision inside him, and its bursting out of him, begging to be born into the world. He has theses creatives who eventually emerge to become geniuses in their fields, combined by implied happenstance, and, one by one, they are peeled apart. Jodorowsky stripped each one of them of their insecurities, their bad habits, their consumer-imposed limitations. He burned off everything but the genius inside. He made them bloom. They were brought to him, and it was meant to be.

Jodorowsky has stated that Dune is intended to be mind-altering, a hallucinogen without ingestion of substances; instead it infiltrates your mind in a way that reprograms neural pathways. Dune was a holy mission for Jodorowsky, slated to change the world and its human consciousness forever. And you believe him. You do. You still do.

Then the revelations come. You are buffeted in explosions of astonished insight that alters your understanding of cinematic history. You peel yourself from the floor in disbelief. You lament what was lost, yourself lost in Jodorowskys madness. The future that could have been, if Jodorowsky had his way. The inalterable, once you see it, future that is, because of what he did decades ago. Bowman in 2001: a space odyssey said, My God, its full of stars. What Bowman saw was not even an inkling of what Jodorowsky saw.

You cant help but imagine cosmic entities playing an complicated endgame in which the forces of mindless consumption is pitted against the expansion of human spirits, and Jodorowsky is a gambit in a long game, the Dark Knight upon a Dark Horse, in which Dune slowly simmers across decades to delicately emerge into an time ready for it. In a way, this documentary is Jodorowskys Dune, maybe as it was meant to be. A masterpiece unlike any documentaryor movieyouve seen, Jodorowksys Dune, is quite easily, if you're of a similar bent of mind as myself, the best thing youve seen.",1424390400,2,3815,4.925349922239502

6336444,4,B00J5LXMTG,"A group of talking heads sit down to chat about the ""most ambitious sci-fi epic never made."" Which, I realize, sounds like some rather exaggerated, overplayed hyperbole. Thing is, between the director's intense dedication to the project and remarkable eye for talent, it quickly seems like a pretty reasonable statement. Alejandro Jodorowsky, who single-handedly provides much of the documentary's narration, is both the best and the worst thing to happen to this launchpad-implosion of a film. His confidence can often come off as egotism, and his absurd track record quickly turned off any potential Hollywood suitors (ultimately damning the picture) but in retrospect there's no arguing with the impact his hand-picked team made on the world of science fiction at large. Then-unknowns like HR Giger and Mbius would go on to enormous careers, both in the cinema and art scenes, while many of their collaborators found themselves poached for future hits like Star Wars and Alien. There's a certain irrational appeal to the man himself, which immediately comes through in his speech and mannerisms. It's no wonder major celebrities like Pink Floyd and David Carradine would attach themselves to the project, mingling with brow-furrowing supporting acts like Orson Welles and Salvador Dali. The big question of how the film could make the translation from eccentric paper-bound concept to vivid on-screen special effect (in a pre-Lucasfilm world, no less) is never adequately answered, and that hurts in the long run, but as an exercise in unbridled, unhinged creative discharge it's fascinating.

At the same time, I can't review this film without also reviewing how it was presented to me. I paid money to ""own"" this film on Amazon Instant Video. I use my PS3 to watch my Amazon streaming. A little while back Amazon added a new ""feature"" to its streaming. At the end of the film, usually just as the credits roll, they put up a banner at the bottom of the screen suggesting other videos you might want to watch... even though you're not done with what you are currently watching. And it's not even a banner showing other things you might want to buy. No. It lists other things you've already watched! I mean an ad for them to make more $$$ would still be annoying but it would at least make sense of why they are ruining what I'm watching.

Jodorowsky's Dune though is even worse. They don't put the banner up when the credits start, they put it up five minutes before the credits. So while you are still invested in what you are watching they put up a banner that, beyond the normal annoyance level, actually prevents you from reading the subtitles you need to finish enjoying the movie.

6336447,5,B00J5LXMTG,"Our popular culture is steeped in a fascination with the production and marketing of movies that often threatens to eclipse our interest in movies themselves.
What we are woefully in the dark about is the preproduction of movies, so much so that even though this documentary was all about Alejandro Jodorowsky, one of my favorite directors of all time, I was skeptical that it could hold my interest, seeing as it was all about a film that was cancelled before a single shot was taken. It seemed that even a best case scenario would only have one pining to see a movie that never could be seen, rather than enjoying the movie one is seeing.
My skepticism melted away quickly as I watched this. Jodorowsky, as anyone who's listened to his commentary on El Topo or Holy Mountain knows, is fascinating to listen to as well as to act. His ideas are so grandiose and at the same time so heartfelt, his erudition so inspirational, his spirit so untamed even at age 84, the age when he was filmed for this project. But his Dune is remarkable for how much other top notch talent was brought in. There's HR Giger of Alien fame, Dan O'Bannon who did Dark Star and Alien, Chris Foss, whose illustrations of space ships filled the Terran Trade Authority books that so fascinated me as a child, and of course Mbius, that incredible French comic book artist who went on to do so many fascinating collaborations with Jodorowksy. And all of them participated in some fantastic work, including a full storyboard by Mbius, which is brilliantly animated here, sumptuous costume sketches, a full-color painting of a zebra striped, psychedelic hued pirate spaceship hemorrhaging spice by Foss and four stunning airbrush paintings of the Harkonnen castle by Giger, And then at the end, just after the story is told of how Hollywood turned down an opportunity to fund the project to a score of a (measly sounding to today's ears) $15 million, irony of all ironies because they doubted that big budget, special effects laden science fiction epics would be capable of attracting big audiences (and more reasonably because they were afraid that Jodorowsky would make the movie too long and too challenging for American audiences) documentary makers tack on a pretty astounding montage of how many of the Dune ideas have been translated into such memorable films as Star Wars, Flash Gordon, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Contact.
The film is relatively merciful on David Lynch's Dune, but the minuscule sampling they do have, featuring Sting, of course, makes it hilariously clear that Lynch's version was simply on a much lesser plane than Jodorowsky's. Lynch would bounce back to make the amazing Wild At Heart, which I just watched recently (wow!), but one gets the sense that a part of Jodorowksy never recovered completely from having this project, which could well have been his masterpiece, scuttled so unceremoniously.",1421625600,5,2897,4.878296146044625

As a huge Sci Fi fan... Star Wars, Alien, (Lynch's) Dune, The Matrix, and everything that followed... you have to really really appreciate just how crazily influential Jodorowsky was and is.

Probably a bigger impact, arguably, than if the film had gone on to become the box office disaster it promised to be.

6336489,5,B00J5LXMTG,"For most of cinematic history, movies have been products rather than art. Oh, many of the greatest movies have been works of art as well, but they are usually underscored by the studios and their need to market it to as many people as possible.

So there's something almost hypnotically fascinating about ""Jodorowsky's Dune,"" a documentary about the greatest movie never made -- a nonexistent epic art film based on Frank Herbert's novel, by the director of ""El Topo"" and ""The Holy Mountain."" It's almost mesmerizing how much talent and wild creative energy was gathered into a single focus... and it ultimately leaves you sad that his version of ""Dune"" was never seen outside of the creators' heads.

In the 1970s, Alejandro Jodorowsky optioned the novel ""Dune"" for his next movie, even though he hadn't actually read it yet. But before long, he had a sprawling, exquisitely-detailed space opera in his head, and began assembling a team of ""spiritual warriors"" to help him bring it to life -- artists HR Giger and Chris Foss, special effects artist Dan O'Bannon (later of ""Alien""), rock bands Magma and Pink Floyd, and a nearly-all-star cast including Salvador Dali, Mick Jagger, Orson Welles, David Carradine, and so on.

And all the pieces seemed to be falling into place -- every person who he approached became enmeshed in his wild creative vision, including the notoriously difficult Welles (whom he had to bribe with food). Concept art from the time reveals a vibrantly weird plan, including a Harkonnen palace shaped like the Baron, camouflaged birdlike spacecraft, and the single most epic establishing shot in cinematic history.

There is nothing of this vision except for the concept art, but what little we see (some of which is turned into simple animated shorts) and hear from those involved is mesmerizing. And while technically an adaptation of ""Dune,"" it soon becomes clear that this is not Herbert's vision or philosophy, but Jodorowsky's (""I was raping Frank Herbert..."") and he was creating a spectacle with the novel merely as the springboard.

But the massive wellspring of creativity hit a brick wall when Jodorowsky was confronted by the studio, mainly over budgetary concerns, a massive running time, and the resistance to letting Jodorowsky realize his vision. And of course, it demanded special effects that would honestly be difficult to achieve even today.

Tragically, it was cancelled by the studio just before the set construction was intended to begin, and the film was ultimately given to David Lynch. And with the massive amount of creative talent involved, it actually became influential to hit movies as well -- from little things like the robot POV or the costumes, to the action of ""Star Wars"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" and the sprawling sets and spectacles of movies like ""Prometheus,"" ""Alien,"" ""Flash Gordon,"" ""Contact."" And from these other projects came many of the classics of science fiction today.

Alejandro Jodorowsky is a fascinating figure even today -- the documentary spends the majority of its time lingering on the dynamic, passionate old man, expounding with excitement over the vision that never came to fruition. He's a singularity of shining creative energy, and despite his efforts to overcome it (""Dune is cancelled! Yes! So what?"") he clearly still feels pain and disappointment over what happened. Even as he tries to sound happy about the success of his ""spiritual warriors,"" there is clearly a sadness in him.

Consider the amount of money squandered on movies like ""John Carter"" and ""The Lone Ranger,"" both coldly commercial and financially disastrous. It makes you wish that someone would lavish money on him today to bring his epic story to life.

But it's somehow inspiring to see so many creative people working in harmony, and creating something so purely artistic and epic that it cannot be quenched simply by studio squeamishness. Instead, the creativity and visual splendor was spread across an entire film genre, seeding the world of science fiction movies (and Jodorowsky's underrated comics) with a sublime, haunting beauty, horror and majesty that it wouldn't have had otherwise.

Ultimately, ""Jodorowsky's Dune"" is inspiring not because of what was accomplished despite the odds, but because Jodorowsky urges people, ""If you fail, is not important. Try!"" And the documentary of the ""Dune"" that never was is a bittersweet, mesmerizing experience because of that.",1419811200,,4444,5.142659279778393

6336519,2,B00J5LXMTG,"Illusions linger on.  Nothing really new here, sensation-seekers.

Actually, the longer I bother to think about this puff piece, the more it burns me.

Everything about AJ's ""vision"" was in opposition to what Frank Herbert's creation is really all about.
Sacrilegious parasitism?  What a shame.  And his choices in production design: La Cage Au FOLLY. What a mess this would have been.  What a blessing that the ""system"" actually worked to our benefit in helping us dodge this particular cinematic bullet to the brain.

This thing's just another sorry attempt at self-appointed film maven historical revisionism. Lot of that going around lately, particularly due to the dreaded Film School virus.  Too bad, guys, but most of the salient points about this aborted ""Dune"" project were readily available during the late 70's.  Just check back issues of Starlog, Cinefantastique, even Fangoria.

And, by the way, the supposed ""imitation"" in Prometheus of the Baron's castle is more accurately the use of a Giger structure originally designed to appear in Alien.  Fact check: The Book of Alien. Too many other examples of this sort of misinformation in this half-baked documentary for me to bother mentioning.

Suffice it to say that this version of the story offers only a few mild attempts at objectivity.  Ludicrously it almost entirely glosses over Kubrick's actual groundbreaking precedent of his SF trilogy: Strangelove/2001/Clockwork Orange - all made before '75, all truly providing a rich source of artistic and technical inspiration for films to follow.  And that is an inarguable fact, not fuzzy opinion based on a few circulated copies of a coffee table book.

More to the point: what about JOHN SCHOENHERR?
His illustrations for the serialized edition of Dune World and Prophet of Dune set the visual standard for Herbert's universe back in the mid 60's.  No mention, no credit is given this artist's imaginative, organic, tonal realizations, in black and white and color.

Equally pertinent, this conveniently self-promoting bit of propaganda pretends, by disingenuous omission, that only AJ's particular project ever foundered in ""Development Hell"".  What of Kubrick's Napoleon?  And I recall Polanski openly discussing his research on Selznick's unmade Tess of the D'Ubervilles before proceeding with his adaptation. So only naifs need buy in to the dopey notion that Alejandro Jodorowsky was the intellectual father of modern movie fantasy/science fiction.  More than a conceited stretch, that is an outright lie.

I recall first greeting the news of the director of the silly El Topo's ambition with dismay and dread. Only Village Voice-type cineaste elitists seemed excited at that prospect. Grateful for the supposedly archaic and corrupt film industry to have shown enough sense to turn it aside.  Funny, isn't it, that the fact Jodo wasted  millions of other people's money is barely mentioned here - ars gratuitous artis?

This deeply ""spiritual"" man gloats over how overjoyed he was to disdain the failure of Lynch's attempt (which I too dislike), yet offers not the slightest reason why he considered it poorly.  Likewise, zero mention of the Harrison adaptations (again, disappointing to me).  However, actually I enjoy Alejandro Jodorowsky's personality; he remains a most engaging and interesting fellow.  Why he did not continue to make his own style of cinema after failing with Dune is actually the more interesting topic for this fawning piece to pursue - another aspect conveniently avoided.  I wish him much luck in the remainder of his life and career.  But thank God he never made this movie.

6336567,5,B00J5LXMTG,"I believe I am one of the few viewers who actually liked David Lynch's film DUNE. Apparently, he was not in control of the final editing, which led to problems for people who had NOT read the novel. For someone like myself who had read it twice with delight and consider it one of the greatest novels of the century (yes!), there was no problem following the film. However, I did not appreciate the changes Lynch made in the plot. For example, the ridiculous rainfall miracle at the end - I'll say no more about that misguided detail. Lynch's staging of the big scenes and his shaping of the performances were both excellent. H-O-W-E-V-E-R, having watched this brilliant documentary with the utterly persuasive and charismatic Jodorowsky at its center I must affirm him as the ideal director of DUNE. What a marvelous grasp of cinematic possibility he displays! What rapport with actors, set designers, technicians he shows! What a VISION he makes palpable as he talks to us with fierce commitment! Before this film was half way over, Jodorowski had become one of my Culture Heroes along with Joseph Campbell, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Robert Bly, and Kathleen Raine. They are all artists with both a comprehensive vision and a sensitivity to the details which are, after all, the elements  of the whole. This film is somewhat reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's film about his DON QUIXOTE project. Both directors fault the BIG STUDIOS with sabotaging on-going projects, not because of the artists' failure, but because they lost faith in the project's money-making . Jodorowsky is like an Old Testament prophet railing against  those who put profit before the truth of The Faith, which in this case is ART. I felt like I was in the presence of the classic tragic hero, who refuses to whine or cower, but protests in the name of Justice. He is that impressive a figure.

6336614,4,B00J5LXMTG,"What is the goal of life? Its to create yourself a soul.

Trouble at the first words, the quote above refuses humanity to anyone unwilling to put in the effort to make a soul. The hidden lie, of course, is: which totalitarian regime judges what work is soulful? And such is needed; something as ad omnibus as the pre-Revolutionary Roman Church which, after all, threw in the soul gratis with the flesh but held a proprietary accompt over how you treated it.

I have not seen El Topo or The Holy Mountain by Alejandro Jodorowsky but I will, because I wish to see what his Dune might have been like. That being said, any person who pauses to think should thank their lucky stars that Jodorowsky was stopped before he could make this film and destroy dozens of lives and untold wealth in the desert of Algiers.

Simply put: no man who could do what Jodorowsky did to his own son should have any position of authority ever. Those old silent films were not worth running cattle off of cliffs to their deaths; this film would have been no different.

Lots of charming stories are told by the would-be crew, most are quite entertaining and informative, painting Jodorowsky as an even more driven Steve Jobs. H.R. Giger sounds like a precocious prepubescent boy with a frog in his throat here; this dashes ones expectations of a gravel-voiced necromantic cyberneticist but a surprising disconnect between a non-performing artist and his work is hardly new, just as Nicolas Winding Refns raging paranoia is not shocking but still unpleasant.

Indeed, as quirky as Jodorowsky is, with his expressive hands and onomatopoeia, the most threatening figures in this documentary are the rabid fanboys. Refn quietly seethes over the damage done by Star Wars and the megabucks blockbuster structure, ignoring that Jaws started that two years prior. Some blame the same big American film corporations that funded 2001: A Space Odyssey and Star Trek: The Motion Picture, both science fiction films with oddly spiritual takes, as out to destroy higher consciousness once and for all.

(Oddly, no one blames Michel Seydoux, who had never produced any film, let alone with a Chilean megalomaniac, before 1973, the year Seydoux distributed The Holy Mountain in Europe and offered, and failed, to fund said maniacs next.)

The fanboys cite Frank Herberts spice melange as a consciousness-expanding drug, which makes some sense since Jodorowskys idea was to recreate 60s LSD visions as drug-free cinema. But they also compare Arrakis, or Dune, to Afghanistan as a place of supreme geopolitical importance. What else do they get wrong?

In story, sandworms exude melange and are only found on Arrakis. Melange offers man life extension, expanded consciousness and awareness, and precognition. Only precognition allows safe use of the faster-than-light Holtzman drive. Thus melange alone creates the entire Galactic economy. The water of life, another sandworm product, offers access to past lives but it too becomes another control battle.

For Herbert, the spice of Dune is a hydraulic despotism, a lens to concentrate and examine political power, which is the core of Dune: a comparatively mature contemplation of power, its benefits and costs, its ultimate goals. I say comparatively because it is the sin of critics who know nothing of Renaissance England to babble about how William Shakespeare understood power and politics, who knew nothing of the sort. Shakespeare lived not too long after Agincourt, when men at arms did all the fighting as a disorganized mob, when authority end law extended as far as your mailed fist or naked voice could project. (When you read a Shakespearean king and his words suddenly shift into hyperdrive, the tingle up your spine is exactly this projection.)

Herbert began Dune as a novel about Liet-Kynes and desert ecologies, but by publication in 1965 (by Chiltons!) the true subject was power and CHOAM, his feo-totalitarian cartel earning most of its profits from spice, was explicitly based on OPEC (prescience indeed). Religion in Dune is taken seriously but never literally, as expression of human will, faith and drive. In Herbert, as in Heinlein, expanded consciousness leads only to philosophy on how and when to use governing force. Hippie visions need not apply.

David Lynchs Dune was quite faithful to the book but inspires hostility from Jodorowsky and others, who come looking for religious ecstasy and get nothing but Machiavellian philosophy (the original maligned Republican). The friend who recommended Herberts novel to Jodorowsky may not have known how ill-fit the two minds were. Jodorowsky follows Strindberg, Lynch an American magical realism; Lynch frets the novels politics less. (Or perhaps magical naturalism: consider the ear in Blue Velvet: a call to adventure in the heros journey to the underworld, where nothing is supernatural at all but the world is still a strange and dangerous place.)

The fanboys also natter on how this unmade film influenced others. Some are honest and direct: Dan OBannon, post-Jodo, hired Giger to design the Xenomorph for Alien. But how many other films did this affect? They mention the Terminators computer readout vision as a legacy of the unmade Dunes storyboards, but by 1973 we had already seen Westworld through Yul Brynners infrared vision. How many people saw Jodos storyboard books? How many were made when only two still exist?

As I watch, at some point, El Topo, I will not like it. Messianic, religio-political Latin/Catholic visions always leave me cold. But I hope to be fascinated at least once as I was by this documentary.",1412553600,,5614,5.082519001085776

Unless, I suppose, you really like middle-aged Sean Connery running about on horseback and afoot in a red leather speedo/diaper with matching suspenders and thigh high boots, and that is but one of many images I would like to excise from my memory.  (Share my pain.)

Jodorowsky himself strikes me as a titanic ego hunting innocent icebergs to molest, and he would have done nothing nice to Frank Herbert's novel--but then again, the movie he would have made would have been so far from the source material as to be a different entity entirely.  Sort of like going to see the joint adaptation of  ""Pride and Prejudice"" by David Cronenberg and Rob Zombie.  (Which strikes me as being much more interesting than the original, but anyway...)

Visually, this would have been a stunning film.  There is no other way to describe the costuming, art direction and pre-production work, which is displayed to great effect in the documentary.  As is pointed out in the documentary, later films like ""Alien"" owe a lot to Jodorowsky's Dune, for both bringing new artists into the movie business, and getting the movie business ready for new ideas in art.  The talent and skill of the concept artists individually is formidable, and as a group--if their own work were to have been realized--would have made the movie worth watching.  Probably with the sound off, the Pink Floyd soundtrack playing separately on your stereo.

One annoyance with the extras: the deleted scenes lack subtitles or other translation.

The documentary itself does what justice for the work as can be done from a distance of 30-odd years.  Personally, I would have appreciated more screen time with the concept artists (Chris Foss, H.R. Geiger) than the extended interviews with Jodorowsky (nuts, but in a mostly good way) and his money-man (boring in that special fashion only accountants can achieve).  In the way ""Lost in La Mancha"" gave us glimpses of the Terry Gilliam movie the universe connived to keep from us, this documentary gives voice to the ""Dune"" we managed to escape.",1410998400,2,2272,4.95778364116095

6336687,4,B00J5LXMTG,"Despite the title, this documentary is really more for fans of science fiction in cinema than of the novel Dune. In fact, I'm thoroughly convinced that Jodorowsky's version of Dune would have been an atrocity. Jodorowsky comes across as very charming but also a bit of a charlatan. He keeps emphasizing that his film would have changed the world and uplifted consciousnesses, but I have a hard time believing that any movie could have such a profound impact (Star Wars comes the closest). More importantly, Jodorowsky admitted to not having read the book and clearly didn't understand key aspects of the story (Frank Herbert wanted to warn against charismatic leaders, not make Paul into a Christ-like figure).

The documentary does a very good job in bringing this unmade film to life. There are some great images from unused concept art, as well as a few neat camera tricks, to keep it lively. However, felt the documentary really became JODOROWSKY'S Dune rather than Jodorowsky's DUNE. Jodorowsky's is definitely the focus and gets the lion's share of time. Most of the rest of the interviewees spend their time talking about Jodorowsky. This is fine insofar as the documentary needed to personalize the struggle to put Dune on film, but at times I felt it almost distracted from other parts of the production.

The other aspect I felt missing from the documentary was the story of Dune. The actual story is barely mentioned. The film pretty much assumes you know Frank Herbert and his works. Yet there were some missed opportunities to think about how and why Jodorowsky's Dune differed from Herbert's work. I would have enjoyed perhaps hearing what Dune scholars thought about those changes. I'd imagine Frank Herbert, who was alive at the time, also had some thoughts on the subject. Unfortunately, there's probably not enough for hardcore Dune fans.

Ultimately, I definitely recommend checking this documentary out if you're interested in science fiction in cinema. There are some notable sci-fi gurus, including H.R. Giger, who got their start on this movie. If you're just coming at this documentary from a Dune perspective, you'll probably find less to satisfy.",1409702400,2,2172,5.06145251396648

6336711,5,B00J5LXMTG,"I'm so glad this movie wasn't made !! There must be a god somewhere after all and he's guarding science fiction against this types of ""artistic/installation"" things... Salvador Dali, Mick Jagger ?!! Creating a movie for the LSD drug culture ?! Directing in in the alucinated style of the prior movies the director did ?!! What ?!!! Pink Floyd ?!!!! What ?!! I'm so glad someone prevented this from happening as it would be awful and science fiction would never take of. If this Dune version would be made, today sci-fi would not only still be viewed as matinee serial type stuff as it used to be, but worse, science fiction would be forever attached to something the LSD , Hippie, Andy Warhol ""art"" culture had produced and forever stuck in the 60's drug culture, peace&love ghetto.

And i thought crap movies like Transformers and Alien vs Predator forever ruined modern sci-fi at the movies!! Man, i will never speak anything bad against Michael Bay ever again. His movies might be like awful empty shell with style over substance and ruined visual style in modern sci-fi, but had this DUNE version been made and science fiction would be connected to this dazzed out LSD ""art"" filosophy Jodorowsky wanted to depict in the movie. After watching the documentary, i think a DUNE version like this would kill sci-fi forever at the movies.
And that ending Jodorowsky wanted for the story not only ruined the original novel but was so freaking -far out man- that it's a joke even with all those good intentions of spiritual messages in it. Spiritual messages stuck in time around the LSD thing. DUNE would never recover from this and i can bet millions of books would never be sold if this movie was ever made. I for one would never read the novels if this DUNE version was ever made and im sure it would ruined the entire universe for me. I would be reading the books and visualizing all that hiipie ""art"" fashion imagery that is shown in the documentary. It would be like trying to watch Star Wars looking like a cross between Barbarella and Flesh-Gordon (not Flash, Flesh-Gordon...)
Dune would feel like a really bad Zardoz style movie and Zardoz was awful enough for being to dated and also stuck in those peace & love drug culture times.

As a huge fan of David Lynch's Dune, im so happy that i got that one instead. It might be flawed, but it's Dune. The atmosphere is there, the universe is there and even the drug culture references from the 60s are there, but they are not as ""artsy"" or throwned at your face as jodorowsky was trying to do. Its clear Jodorowsky didn't cared for the novel. He only wanted to do it because it could be a good veicule for him to use it as a great ART movie and nothing else.
By the way, theres a great incredible fan cut of David Lynch's Dune out there; its called DUNE REDUX (search for it if you're a fan).

I was watching this excellent documentary and i couldn't believe my eyes and ears. For one thing i admired Jodorowsky passion for the project and he seems to be a great creative person and i can relate to that as im an illustrator myself. But im sorry, he didn't wanted to create Dune, he wanted to use Dune to creat an artistic instalation that would represent all those LSD times references instead of a movie. It would be like some kind of crappy instalation made for cinema ""masterpiece"" but it wouldn't be Dune and it sure wouldnt be science fiction.

I'm an illustrator because of Moebius which was my main influence when i was growing up in the 70s and discovered his art and watching the work he did for this Dune project, my reaction is of admiration and repulse. Because despite his amazing work there and it was pure 70s Moebius, that simply didn't fit DUNE.
I think on thing the Lynch's version got incredible right was the entire universe and atmosphere and it was not the crazy 5th Element fashion statement that Moebius had done for the characters in Jodorowsky version either. No way. Those designs are now closer to what has been done with the recent modern tv series of Dune some years back than it were related to a real Dune novel universe.
In fact, even Frank Herbert when said the visual representation of Lynch was spot on and even went furhter than he had imagined when writing the novel.

The Moebius designs were ""awful"" simply because it would turn everything into the ""artistic installation"" that Jodorowsky was aiming for and im glad someone at the studios got scared when he saw the director's prior .... ehm... ""masterpieces"" in cinema... (by the way i've seen them too and i wished i didnt...cant stand that ""artsy"" hippie 60s Austin Powers style done seriously...)
The rest of the designs for spaceships were cool but were also a product of that Era and would be totally dated right now. Something that didn't happened with David Lynchs Dune (or Star Wars) as its visuals could have been created today and has influenced as much set pieces over the years as Blade Runner did too.

For me the only thing cool about this movie would be the intro, but done in the early 70's im not sure it would even work, particulary when Jodorowsky choose Dan Obanon to do the special effects after the psychadelic work he had done in John Carpenter's Dark Star...man...brrr.....
This documentary horrified me and fascinated me. Loved the persons involved, everyone seemed very honest and excited to do the best job they could but sorry folks you were not making Dune, you were making ""ART"" and im glad it wasn't made.

Im also glad it wasn't made because if it had been made one of my favorite ""bande-desinee"" series (european style comics) would never happened if Dune happened instead.
The INCAL series created by Moebius and Jodorowsky scrapping all their ideas not used in Dune is still one of the best sci-fi sagas in european comics ever, on par with ""Valerian"" by Mezieres.
Now i can look at those and really see Jodorowsky Dune in it. In comics it works perfectly, in cinema no way !!!!! It wouldnt be Dune, it would be ""art"" stuck in an era that i cannot relate at all and in my opinion it would ruin science fiction as a genre forever. Unless Star Wars could clean the path after that. But if Dune happened maybe a Star Wars wouldnt even be released as im sure Dune would be a failure if you were not taking Lsd yourself while going to the movies and studios would be scared to bet on another sci-fi. Star wars could end up being compared to Jodorowskys Dune forever....and that would be even worse than having to deal with the awful SW Prequels nowadays.

And im also not so sure about that claim at the end that Jodorowsky Dune influenced all the major sci-fi movies that came next...the movie wasn't even done ! People wouldnt be influenced by a script that wasn't available to the public. So that claim is a bit farfecthed. It had ideas ahead of its time but those same ideas came also to other directors over the years and i do not see how it could be responsible for the major influences claimed in the documentary.

I totally recommend this documentary to everyone that loves scifi. Great interviews lots of fascinating (and horrifying) content and overall if you take it as the story of an artist that had a vision that later ended up becoming a lot of other much better things instead its an amazing documentary.

An i hope someone would release that script/storyboard book that is showned there as i would buy it for sure.

As for Dune, there's only one DUNE and its not even Lynchs version...its the new FAN CUT - DUNE REDUX V.2  .... Look for it on the web if you don't know anything about this incredible new edditing that restores a lot of great stuff from the book(its not the awful tv editing version with 3 hours done some years ago, its a new 2012 fan cut).

Overall, Jodorowky's Dune is great documentary about a trully awful art movie/instalation that fortunely never was made because someone somewhere had the good sense to know that this was not going to be Dune at all. Im still in shock thinking this could have happened...we could even had by now a Pink Floyd album called Dune...oh man...please no...",1408492800,,8099,4.55807560137457

He *did* brag that he felt like he was raping the novel, and Frank Herbert as well...I'm paraphrasing here: ""like a husband rapes his wife on their wedding night...lovingly of course, but he rapes her. That's how you make a film.""

Jodorowsky claimed that this was a movie for the LSD lovers. He would have wanted you see the film sober, he says; and claimes the movie would have expanded your mind the same way, and become the most incredible movie ever to be filmed.

He brags that he took liberties with the story line. (Is a **spoiler alert** necessary if the film was never made?) In his version, Duke Leto was to have been castrated during a bull fight. The Lady Jessica would prick the duke's finger and inseminate herself with a drop of his blood that she inserts, well, you know, but if you don't, Jodorowsky had a scene in mind for that, where we travel up the birth canal and witness a drop of blood work its magic on an ovum. To Pink Floyd music. Thus, the immaculate conception of Paul occurs.

Paul would be slain at the end by Feyd Rautha, only to become part of everyone's consciousness! Everyone adopts Paul's voice and intones. ""I am Paul.""

Groovy, man! Pass the bong; this is SO DEEP!!!

The only thing positive I can say is that, had this movie been made, it would have made David Lynch's version look like ""Gone With the Wind"" by comparison.

I enjoy watching behind-the-scenes documentaries as much as the next film buff. But unless you like watching pompous, name-dropping ""legends in their own minds"" bragging about their own sense of greatness, don't waste your time, effort or money.",1407369600,41,1882,4.533923303834809
6336758,3,B00J5LXMTG,"Interesting documentary.  Not quite as mind-blowing as I had expected though.  The most interesting thing was to see how a movie that was never released could still be so influential.

Honestly though, as a fan of Dune, I just don't see how this movie would have been that great.  Jodo had some crazy, unique ideas... but I don't know what any of it had to do with Dune.  I believe his movie would have felt a lot like Lynch's Dune.  Both filmmakers approached the story of Dune without much understanding of it.  This is evident throughout the documentary as almost everyone involved with the film admits to never having read the book - some, to this day.  I think the only person who had read the book was Dali's muse.

I understand that an adaptation needs the freedom to do its own thing, but I don't believe Jodo's movie would have been 'Dune.'  Lynch's movie wasn't 'Dune' either.

In the end, I actually agree with the studio executives who turned down Jodo's ideas.  Following a drop of blood into someone's vagina and watching it turn into a baby doesn't exactly sound like a great idea to me.  It also doesn't sound like Dune.  The whole idea throws out the Bene Gesserit altogether.

Herbert's Dune was about the dangers of hero-worship; the failure of 'messiahs.'  It strove to pull the curtain back to show us that our heroes are really nothing special.  Everyone worshipped Paul as a messiah, but he was really just a product of good breeding who used a lot of spice.  Eventually, he failed, too; which poses even more questions about the way we view ourselves.

Both Jodo's Dune and Lynch's Dune tackle none of those ideas.  They merely strive (or, would have strived) to be space operas with happy Paul-is-God-Now endings.

Jodo's Dune would have certainly been a landmark in filmmaking.  But I'm affraid it would have been remembered more for how ballsy it was rather than how good it actually was.  Again, Hollywood was smart to use the talent he'd gathered together.

The influence of Jodorowsky's Dune is far reaching and seeming omnipresent in the Sci Fi Films that came after.  All this from a film that was never made!

6336779,5,B00J5LXMTG,"I read Dune.  I read it when it was FIRST printed: in serial editions of a sci-fi magazine decades ago.  I thought it was a great novel.  So did some film directors, like Alejandro Jadorowsky.  This documentary is about his film making and his greatest work, which was never actually made: his version of Dune.  Along the way you see brief shots from two prior films: El Topo and The Magic Mountain.  These very quickly convinced me that he must be, at the least, a madman, or else a genius and a madman.  By the end of the movie, I concluded he is both.

Giving away some of the plot: his work on this project pre-dated ""Star Wars"" by about two years.  At the time, the furthest that computer graphic special effects had gone was ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".  Dune is a fairly long novel, set on another world in a universe far, far away.  Jadorowsky's vision encompassed special effects somewhat beyond Star Wars, to be done with a modest budget.  It also planned to include some really BIG names playing some of the roles.  It got as far as a beautifully designed storyboard, printed up like one of those over- large and hefty art books some people put on their coffee table to impress guests.  This was sent to all the major studios, looking for the rest of the funding needed to actually go into production.  They all found it very interesting, but too big a gamble.  Jadorowsky, late in this documentary, then speaks of learning that the film rights were subsequently sold to David Lynch and how he was simultaneously happy and depressed.  As he puts it, he knew Lynch had real talent, so the movie would get made, though not by him.  He was terrified to think he might find Lynch's version better than his own.  His son eventually talked him into going to the theatre and watching it, and he describes how, as the film went on, his fear turned into massive relief.  A TERRIBLE movie!  [True--it WAS a terrible movie--mainly because it completely perverted the central idea of the book, but that's another story].  He's generous to Lynch, in saying Lynch himself would never have done a movie like this--the producers must have insisted on him going along with THEIR vision.  And Jodorowsky then gives a short, impassioned speech about the inherent contradiction between a director who wants to produce a work of art, and a studio that wants a guaranteed good profit more than anything else.  Lastly there is talk about how it may be the most important film never actually made, and proceeds to compare designs in the storyboard with scenes from subsequent (generally science fiction) films that studios actually released.

It may be a good thing that he didn't get to make his version of Dune but this left me with an interest in seeing his other films, bizarre as they may be.  He's obviously a director with charisma, passion...and a touch of madness.  Great documentary.",1406937600,,2876,4.654761904761905

And lets face it, Alejandro is making art here in as much as Picasso created his own abstract art. With DUNE, he was stepping more into the 'normal' cinema with his ideas for the epic he was trying to make. The major studios wanted to make his movie, without him directing it. They were concerned that his ideas would drive the film over budget or even deviate from his script completely and go off into metaphysical space. So, a vastly terrible, version of DUNE, was made by David Lynch. Jodorowsky's version would have reshaped Lucas's films and Spielberg's films and so forth. In fact, the crew he had assembled was captured for other Hollywood movies and after watching this documentary, you'll realize what movies were made only because he had assembled a first time film crew with the visions to see beyond the story lines they were creating or working with. As Alejandro states, if DUNE had been made by him and his visionaries....""Would have been fantastic, no?"" This is a great documentary. You need to see it.",1406851200,2,1115,4.723076923076923

6336808,5,B00J5LXMTG,"Jodorowsky's ""Dune"" is one of a few would be masterpieces which has come to light as of recent. It showed up in a book I was reading so viewing the documentary only made sense. What an eye opener.

Here's the scoop. in 1975 director Jodorowky set out to assemble a team to help him turn Frank Herbert's book ""Dune"" into a motion picture. This documentary interviews him as he recounts his efforts to assemble the army of ""warriors"" necessary to do the job.

Wow. What an odyssey. He pretty much takes the viewer step by step in gathering the artists, musicians (Pink Floyd and Magma) the special effects people, actors and the like. He recounts his vision and how he approached these individuals in order to recruit them. I loved listening to this man speak. He's no hack director. He's an artist using film as his canvas. One only need to view his films such as ""El Topo,"" ""Holy Mountain"" and ""Sante Sangre"" to realize he's a man of vision. As he himself says: Dune wasn't to be a movie, it was to be an experience to last through the ages. And as you view the art of Moebius, H.R. Giger and Chris Foss you realize what an impactful visual element the movie would have contained. The sets, spaceships, costumes all were simply incredible. One of the travesties of this is that Jodorowsky had everything wrapped up in a tight package. All a studio needed to do was hit the green light and write a check. They didn't. He lost.

There are Film historians, other directors and such to add flavor to what was happening with the project and how they feel the world was denied one of the great film experiences. I won't spoil but the last 15 or so minutes really underlines what a travesty it truly was. I viewed this documentary right before I hit the sack and I had the weirdest dreams ever that night. This really hit me where I live. This is a must see for any fan of Science fiction film.",1406592000,2,1887,4.416666666666667
6336809,5,B00J5LXMTG,"I already was aware, through THE HOLY MOUNTAIN, that Alejandro Jodorowsky is a visionary when it comes to film. He has a unique way of combining surrealistic imagery and a spiritual aesthetic that is nearly unparalleled. Watching one of his movies is an experience like no other, which makes just a bit sad that his DUNE never materialized into a film. However, there was a lot of pre-production work that went into it and that is what this documentary is about. I was astonished at how much work actually went into this project before studio heads said no to it. Jodorowsky had recruited some of the greatest people in their fields to create for him: people like H.R. Giger and Dan O'Bannon, who created some of the conceptual art for the film. In fact, the entire film exists on paper. There is a script, storyboards, concept art, the whole works. And even though the film was never made, it was a treat to hear all of these people talk about the project and the hopes they had for it. DUNE was ambitious, and maybe just a bit too ambitious for its time. Still, as this documentary points out, it left its mark on science-fiction and its fingerprints can be seen in a lot of films that came after it, from ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER, to THE TERMINATOR, CONTACT and PROMETHEUS. This documentary was fascinating to watch and I highly recommend you check it out.",1406505600,,1357,4.565573770491803
6336810,5,B00J5LXMTG,"This entertaining, inspiring, thoughtful movie is not only about Dune, but about navigating the human experience.  In the 1970s, Jodo was an up and coming, avant garde artist who bit off more than he could chew in trying to convince Hollywood to fund his version of Dune.  With fantastic leadership, advocacy, creativity, religious fervor, and sheer force of will, Jodo got as far as a ready to be made brilliant, highly detailed blueprint for Dune that he and his producer shopped to the major studios.

With only a few avant garde movies under his belt and some wildly imaginative ideas, a visionary such as Jodo was not able to get Hollywood's buy in for his ambitious project.  Jodo got Dali, he got Orson Wells, he got David Carradine, he got Pink Floyd, and he got Mick Jagger, but MGM was too much.  It would have been much safer and more prudent for Jodo to have made a few less costly movies first and thereby condition the public to his unique art, especially given the technical limitations of making sci-fi at the time, but Jodo had grand ambitions that could not wait which led to a grand failure.  Jodo's blueprint for Dune was vast, and at a minimum, he should have tried to convince Hollywood to make the movie in parts, like Star Wars, and allowed himself to be influenced with some boundaries.

An amazing thing about this movie is how far Jodo got and how many of the world's leading artists and musicians he scooped up on his Don Quijote-like mission, and the impact that the script and story boards for his Dune had on many other movies we all know.

Although Jodo's career foundered a bit after his inability to make Dune (he only recently made a very well received movie called The Dance of Reality), after seeing this documentary I want to see Jodo's Dune.  I bet many other new converts will too.  With fantastic visionary energy that shoots through the screen, Jodo is still a force a to be reckoned with and with today's technology making a movie or anime from his blueprint is a only a small step away.

6336818,5,B00J5LXMTG,"Jodorowsky's Dune weaves the tale of the unseen, the untold. It was a film that was sadly never meant to be, too ambitious for the 1970's and possibly even too ambitious even today. Alejandro Jodorowsky, the darling of the late night indie movie seen, was given the opportunity to work his magic on the likes of Frank Herbert's Dune; turning it into a hallucinogenic coming of a god.

The film would star Dali, Mick Jagger, David Carradine, and Orson Welles. With the talents of numerous visionaries including a young H.R. Giger. They were all personally chosen by Alejandro for their spiritual aura.

To quote one review in the film's trailer, ""I drank it up like man in the desert"". The documentary is utterly breath taking simply by the ideas presented, though more attention should have been focused I feel on what transpired in regards to the plot.

6336844,5,B00J5LXMTG,"It's become common knowledge that Alejandro Jodorowsky, one of cinema's most polarizing avant-garde filmmakers, tried to adapt Frank Herbert's novel a decade before David Lynch took the reigns. Even a cursory glance at what Jodorowsky was trying to do at that time, from recruiting Pink Floyd and Magma to provide soundtracks for the heroes and villains (respectively), to casting Orson Welles and Salvadore Dali, gives you the sense that his version of Dune would have been one of the strangest sci-fi movies of all time. Thanks to this documentary, you can now be swept up in a narrative that takes you through what Jodorowsky's Dune could have been. It's not enough to simply read about it; you get to hear from the man himself, look at some of Moebius' shot-for-shot sketches (which are actually spliced together to provide a sense of movement), learn more about how the cast was recruited for their prescribed roles, and question how it could possibly come together the way Jodorowsky wanted it.

It's a matter of speculation as to how this movie would have impacted the motion picture landscape of the 70's, but conceptually, it's still way ahead of its time and has indeed influenced countless sci-fi movies that came to life long after this project collapsed. You're taken through the process and you're introduced to Jodorowsky's zany mystique, but it's quite clear that he was so passionate about what he was doing then and is even more passionate about in retrospect. It's a fascinating, charming, and touching documentary about trying to bring something massive and different to the world.

6336873,5,B00J5LXMTG,"My guess is that most people have never heard of Alejandro Jodorowsky. The acclaimed director broke into notoriety in 1970 with his film EL TOPO, a movie that didn't play the normal film circuit but became one of the first major midnight movies to play across the country. Not sticking to the usual ways movies were made or told, Jodorowsky's fans grew with each film he made. It's surprising that he only directed 9 films total. But the story of what happened after he made his second major success (THE HOLY MOUNTAIN) and started on his next picture may explain that. The name of the movie he was set to make? DUNE.

Yes, we all know that the movie version of DUNE was made by David Lynch, but the truth of the matter is that Jodorowsky was set to direct it before that was ever considered. This documentary tells the story of what happened from start to finish, how a French investor told Jodorowsky he would finance his next picture and when asked what he wanted to do was told DUNE. It progresses with how he hired this person or that person to help tell this grand epic. And eventually it tells the story of how corporate studios run by businessmen rather than film lovers never gave him the chance to make his movie.

Most of this is pretty well known. Going into this film you already know the beginning and the end. But that's not what makes the film so great or so interesting. What makes it that way is Jodorowsky himself. At 85 years old we're given a glimpse at a man who seems far younger than his years, filled with a zest for life and a love of film that few movie makers have. As he talks about his plans for his version of DUNE, Jodorowsky explains that he felt it was a mission, a spiritual goal that he set for himself and expected those who worked with him on the project to share. Indeed, that commitment he sought prevented several top names in the business from being selected to join him on his crusade.

The choices he did make were relatively new to the business at the time and he chose them because he saw something in their art, in the things they had already done, that he thought he could apply to this film. Along with cartoonist/illustrator Moebius he put together an incredibly huge collection of drawings, shot by shot what he intended to put on the screen. Over 3,000 drawings were done, something few had ever done before. He discovered a German artist named H.R. Giger and thought the things he was creating with his art could be applied to this film. He hired Dan O'Bannon to handle the special effects based on the film he and John Carpenter had done, DARK STAR. And with all this talent on hand the film still didn't get made.

The people he hired did go on to some spectacular things though. Moebius continued to be a noted illustrator and cartoonist. Giger went on to create the now famous alien from the movie of the same name. And O'Bannon went on to write ALIEN, LIFEFORCE and RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD. Many of the others involved moved forward into blossoming careers as well.

All of these tidbits come into play as the movie progresses and Jodorowsky tells the story of how it all went down. In the way he describes things, the passion that he displays while talking about a failed movie production, you wish more and more that he had been allowed to make his film. It truly would have been something unseen before. While many directors these days make movies based solely on the amount of money they'll get paid or with the hope of turning one film into a franchise, Jodorowsky wanted to make art. As he gets exciting in telling his tale you'll find yourself excited as well.

While Jodorowsky's DUNE was never made, this may be as close as we'll ever get to seeing that film. Filled with the illustrations that were done, some animated for this film, hearing him discuss his plans and listening to him talk about who he tried to cast in the film makes for great story telling. In the end what I left with after watching this was a desire to see the earlier films he was noted for. They might not end up being anything I will appreciate but at the same time I will know that there was a man filled with passion when it came to the films he created. It's nice to see that on hand these days.",1405468800,,4242,4.404336734693878

He aims for the pinnacle of his subject's potential, uncompromising and unfettered. To watch the ascent of the world's top ""warriors"" (Moebius, Dali, Welles, Giger, O Bannon) become ensnared in his dream is exhilarating. And to watch the system halt the dream is equally crushing. This film, wonderfully constructed by Frank Pavich, will invigorate artists to fight and push through this misguided system of production.

The film is mostly  Mr. Jodorowsky  and a handful of others giving monologues about how Jodorowsky's Dune project was brought to the point where all they needed to make the film was a studio to say yes.  In the process the viewer learns a great deal about Jodorowsky the man.  Mr. Jodorowsky was wanting to keep artistic and creative control of his project and studios wanted a film that would make them money.

6336917,5,B00J5LXMTG,"All the advertising - as well as most reviews - of the 2013 documentary Jodorowsky's Dune  use the phrase ""The Greatest Film Never Made"" (and I guess I am too, right?). That pretty much sums it up in five words. But the story goes deeper.  As I post this review there are already 10 reviews here but most of them are based on either the theatrical release or the Amazon Instant one. The Bluray has 46 minutes of ""Deleted Scenes"" which add to the 90 minute film as released. (One has to wonder what the subject of this fascinating documentary - Chilean Director Alejandro Jodorowsky - would think of paring down 136 minutes to just 90. The 84 year old director (best known for his first film ""El Topo"" ) is engaging in the lenthy interviews that form the central thread of director Frank Povich's project. (He certainly doesn't look 84!

I won't repeat what has been said in the other reviews - about the plot and the amazing ""creative team"" that Jodorowsky assembled to make his 1975 film (years before Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Alien). Orson Welles and Salvador Dali (as actors), Pink Floyd for the score.  I'll, try to add some additional info to guide you in knowing more about the BD release. (A review copy was provided by the studio in advance of release date).

As I said there is 46 minutes of ""deleted scenes"" - there are nine of these scenes. They include a section on the costumes, Frank Herbet's original science fiction novel ""Dune"", Jodorowsky on Hollywood, Jodorowsky's film philosophy and more. And then there is the theatrical trailer.

The film takes an unusual approach to ""subtitles"" .  Because some of the interviewees speak French in the film, English subtitles are necessary. But director Povich has chosen to provide English subtitles even when Jodorowsky is speaking in English, which he does MOST of the time. The comments made by other English-speaking interviewees are not subtitled. The subtitles are in white print and are usually - but not always - easy to read (when there is a white background).

Another thing I wanted to mention is that - even though the film (Dune) was never made, Jodorowsky had produced thick (and I mean 12 inches thick - or more!) volumes of the story boards of the script. Using the images from these books and computer technology (not available in 1975) Povich has ""animated"" sections to give the viewer a sense of ""what might have been"".  And a section near the end shows how Jodorowsky's work influenced later films by Lucas, Scott and others of modern day fantasy films.

I'm not a big Sci-fi fan but I certainly enjoyed this BD and I know that any sci-fi film lover will relish every moment of it.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6336918,5,B00J5LXMTG,"As a long-time fan of Alejandro Jodorowsky's insane and convoluted Bande Dessinee, his conceptual lunacy brought to life by the most impressive array of artists in the history of the medium, this film tells the story behind the stories.

His classic film 'El Topo', like a collaboration between Sergio Leone, Sam Peckinpah,and David Lynch (ironically...), was something completely new, a beautiful, horrific anomaly that is widely credited with starting the 'Midnight Movie' phenomenon of the 70's. Never lacking ambition, Jodo set his sights on adapting Frank Herbert's novel 'Dune', a sprawling science fiction epic that would require a massive budget to bring to the screen.

This fascinating film recounts Jodorowsky's mission to make 'Dune', using his persuasive personality, unshakable self-confidence, and obsessive drive to enlist talents like Orson Welles, Pink Floyd, Salvador Dali, Moebius and H.R. Giger. His script presents a fusion of the original novel with his own distinct narrative elements, and the pre-production stage yields thousands of pages of unorthodox ideas and conceptual art, much of it by Jean 'Moebius' Giraud. When the funding breaks down and Jodorowsky is forced to abandon his dream, much of the work find it's way into his comics debut with Moebius, 'The Incal', a work of imaginative power and artistic brilliance that stands as a modern classic. It also launched Jodorowsky's long and prolific career as BD's pre-eminent writer.

In a strange and somewhat tragic twist, after Jodorowsky is 'fired' as director of the Dune adaptation, the stated reason being that his work was 'too weird', the producers then hired famously weird auteur David Lynch to take over. In a just whim of fate, 'Dune' will prove to be Lynch's one and only failure, both financially and critically. 'Jodorowsky's Dune', on the other hand, is a fascinating look at one of the world's most interesting creative personalities, and how exciting, satisfying, difficult and painful the process of making a movie can be. Unfortunately, we can only speculate on how amazing his version of 'Dune' might have been, but the work done would influence every other science fiction film of the late 70's and 80's, from 'Star Wars' to 'Alien' (H.R.Giger would go from Dune to his famous conceptual designs for Alien, leasing his dark, other-worldly artistry; Dan O'Bannon would go on to write the film) and 'Blade Runner' (Moebius would take much of his experience on Dune into Blade Runner, providing the visionary art behind the stunning architecture and vehicles). By involving so many talented people, many of whom were new to film, and creating these connections that otherwise would never have been made, Jodorowsky's unrealized vision of Dune changed the course of film and comics. The best documentary of the last few years. {91/100}",1404518400,,2836,5.256070640176601
6336919,3,B00J5LXMTG,"This was an ok documentary.  Jodorowsky is an odd bird, but he is filled with a lot of passion and heart.  If you are interested in the story of Dune or if you are thinking of becoming an artist or director, then give this a watch.  It does inspire you in a weird way.  And, it goes to show you that people will rip you off and not give you the deserved credit that is due.  But, Jodorowsky shows you that you have to inspire to go on and do what you do.  Don't let anyone or anything stop you to be an inspirational warrior.",1404172800,7,525,3.9523809523809526
6336920,5,B00J5LXMTG,"Alejandro Jodorowsky is a charismatic 85-year-old Chilean-French idiosyncratic filmmaker.  He's also a writer, graphic novelist, actor, playwright, musician, all around madman and part time guru.  Jodo, as he is known by his many friends and fans, is first and foremost a passionate artist.  He has the soul of a creator who operates with a ferocious vision that remains singular, searing and enigmatic.

He's best-known for writing and directing the underground cult hits EL TOPO and THE HOLY MOUNTAIN that are still popular at special midnight showings.

In 1975, Jodo began working on his most ambitious project yet: an adaptation of Frank Herbert's futuristic Messianic space opera best-seller ""Dune"" starring his own 12-year-old son Brontis alongside Orson Welles, Mick Jagger, David Carradine and Salvador Dali featuring music by Pink Floyd.  The production art was by some of the best, most provocative talents of the time, including Chris Foss, Dan O'Bannon H.R. Giger and Jean ""Moebius"" Giraud.  With key above and below the line talent in place, Jodo was poised to change cinema forever.  In fact, even though the film was never realized as envisioned by Jodo, it did impact numerous films, including STAR WARS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK,  ALIEN and even the more recent PROMETHEUS.  (Unfortunately, David Lynch's DUNE, a big incoherent flop widely derided was not a result of Jodo's lavish and passionate dedication and design.)

Filmed over three years, director Frank Pavich's fabulous documentary on Jodo's ill-fated project is the result of unique and unprecedented access to production material including an extraordinary hard-bound book -- as thick as two big city phone books -- that contained the screenplay, art and meticulous story boards that was used as a ""calling card"" to pitch the movie to main stream studios.  Fascinating interviews including H.R. Giger (artist, ALIEN), Gary Kurtz (producer, STAR WARS) and Nicolas Winding Refn (director, DRIVE) give an unexpected heft and credibility to the material.

JODOROWSKY'S DUNE was an official selection at the 2013 Cannes, Telluride, Toronto and AFI film festivals.

I was blown away by this incredible documentary that is as wonderfully entertaining as it is inspiring.  It is not only about a failed movie project; it is about what it means to be an unfiltered, fully committed artist.  It is about a single-minded, full-blown passion so intense that it consumes fellow artists, musicians and performers.  It is also about how so-called failure has amazing rewards.

Jodorowsky is mesmerizing as he recalls his ambitious venture that does not exist except in the minds of those who created it.  It is not Herbert's ""Dune,"" but a morphed vision that was merely triggered by Herbert and then given a new incarnation by the obsessive, Chilean surrealist.  It's a ""What if"" story written without restraint.  Jodo's stated goal was ""to mutate young minds "" and change the world.  His movie was about the redemption of a planet.  It's not clear why the studios did not want to work with Jodo; the impression I got is that they were afraid of him and his disregard of the film's cost and length.  Jodo has disdain for money to be factor in the creation of true art.

 I can't recommend the movie highly enough.  Sony Classics.  Blu-ray.",1404086400,8,3303,5.134831460674158
6336921,5,B00J5LXMTG,"Sometimes thing's don't always go as planned, as with Jodorowsky's vision of Dune, but sometimes what you don't plan for can be an even greater experience. This documentary reached me in a way that few have before it. Perhaps it's because I love the book so much, but more than that, I feel Jodorowsky helped connect me back to something that I had lost. His spirit and imagination are infectious as he tells the story of making his movie. The fact that the movie was never made is certainly a tragedy, but this documentary may be an ever greater gift than the original film would have. It's enlightening, intelligent, often times surprising, and full of intriguing characters. Just when you think you know the point of the story, they blow your mind with a new revelation.

8648418,3,B00J5LXMTG,"Where Jodorowskys Dune works best, is in illustrating how a lot of elements from the failed project made it into other films, including Star Wars. I would have liked to have known how Jodorowsky felt when Star Wars came out, because clearly, regardless of what you thought about Star Wars back in 1977, it was nowhere near as ambitious as this version of Dune would have been.  In contrast, this film highlights Jodorowskys reaction to Lynchs Dune, and its oddly cathartic for me to see him explain how he feared going to see it, but was then elated when he saw how awful it was.

Ive long known that ALIEN was a direct result of two things, the creation of Star Wars, and the failure to get this version of Dune off the ground. When Star Wars opened to big unforeseen numbers, ALIEN was just a screenplay sitting on Alan Ladd Jrs desk at 20th Century Fox.  At that point, no one knew how long big science fiction was going to remain hot and 20Th Century Fox wanted to strike with another genre film while the iron was hot and so. ALIEN.

Clearly, if Jodorowskys Dune made it to theaters before 1977, Star Wars might have never been made, or it would have been much different. But it never struck me, until I saw it in this documentary, that if this Dune had gotten made, that would mean that ALIEN would not have gotten made, which means that a lot of other famous movies would have never gotten made because they sprung from ALIEN either directly, or indirectly as a result of careers resulting from ALIEN.

I rented this digitally from Amazon because I am currently re-reading the entire original Dune series (Im currently on Heretics of Dune). Looking back on 1975 era special effects, I don't think Jodorowsky could have pulled it off and more importantly, Jodorowskys version of Dune, would have been too far off the mark from the novel.

The common complaint when a movie is adapted from a respected novel, is that it fails to live up to the novel.  This perception is largely due to two things: the visuals of the film contrast what the readers envisioned, and to a greater extent, an inability to fully appreciate how much information is imparted via a novel, as opposed to a film, which due to commercial reasons, is necessarily limited to a running time of roughly two hours.

With a reputed running time of between ten to fifteen hours, Jodorowsky would not have faced these obstacles, especially when one considers that the Dune novel employs every conceivable narrative device to convey information. Theres the standard third person point of view that marks most novels, but theres also first-person narratives and inner dialog. There are also excerpts from fictitious scholarly works, as well as excerpts from poems and songs.  Lynch famously opens Dune with a narrated excerpt of one of Princess Irulans histories, and later employs a few uses of inner dialog.

If Jodorowsky had similarly employed all of these narrative devices, and had he been able to pull off the massive running time, he could have made the most faithful movie adaptation of a novel ever. The problem is that Jodorowsky, having never actually read Dune (incredible!), misses a very fundamental point about the entire, original Dune series. Keep in mind that by the time Jodorowsky embarked on his mission to make Dune, Dune Messiah had already been published (1969).

Heres the thing about the original Dune series, if you read no further than the first novel, Paul and the Atreides in general, are heroic.  But by Dune Messiah, a sort of cynical realism sets in and the line that separates the Atreides apart from the evil Harkonnens and the paranoid, shrewd and heartless machinations of House Corrino, begins to fade.

The list of problems with Lynchs Dune is capped off by giving Paul the power to make it rain on Dune, which would have killed all the sandworms, and destroyed future spice production. Jodorowsky would have flipped the Kwisatz Haderach abilities, that for which he was specifically bred, of being able to recall all the memories of his male ancestors, by instead killing Paul and having his spirit possess everyone present in the final scene.  This would have been presented in a scene very reminiscent of the Im Spartacus moment in Spartacus. From there, Jodorowsky went one step further than Lynchs happy ending, by having Paul green the planet, from beyond the grave, via this odd multi-person possession.

Both Lynchs ending and Jodorowskys proposed ending seemed to be rooted in a nave desire to have a nice ending that flies in the face of Heberts rather sophisticated and nuanced presentation of imperfect, and even horrific politics.

When Dune Messiah begins, the so called good guys have already gone on a multi planet jihad leaving billions of dead bodies in their wake. While the succeeding novels were published after this Dune would have been released, you can still see in those novels, that Herbert departs radically from the typical heroic motifs one associates with epic science fiction.

In Children of Dune, Paul has become this insane, wild priest, and Alia is possessed by the baron.  Traditionally in these types of epics, the good guys prevail definitively. In the Dune series, as in the real world, people adjust as the cultural-political landscape changes, and by the end of Children of Dune, Leto II, has irretrievably set himself on a course to transform into a sentient sandworm.  By the time God Emperor of Dune begins, Leto II has tyrannized the entire human race for over three thousand years, and yet at no point is his character fleshed out as monstrously disturbing and insane as Vladimir Harkonnen. And this, despite the fact that while the Baron was so morbidly obese that he needed anti-gravity suspensors to ambulate, Leto II had mutated into a Jabba the Hutt like creature with a perfectly normal, human face.  Herbert presents a Leto II that had transformed into a monster in literal form, and as head of a tyrannical government, in metaphorical terms as well.

My point is that the original Dune series defies the kind of pat, happy endings of the type Jodorowsky intended, and which Lynch delivered. On the surface, Dune has all the trappings of a space opera, but it clearly isn't one.

Theres also the fact that Jodorowsky made ridiculous, almost childish bargains with both Salvador Dali and Orson Welles to get them to star in the film, those two guys alone would have created a lot of problems for him.

Personally, I don't think a lot of the visuals would have worked on film, and we can see the evidence of that in some of the films that stole/borrowed some of the designs. I cant imagine you can spend enough money to execute some of those costumes and have them look any better than they did in films like Flash Gordon or He-Man.

Ive seen Jodorowskys El Topo, Santa Sangre, and Holy Mountain, and in spite of some highly intriguing ideas for Dune, I don't think he would have been able to pull off Dune in a manner that would have appealed to as wide an audience as possible, or to many sophisticated genre aficionados willing to give him a wide latitude.

Its true that Star Wars ushered in the era of big, flashy, mindless epics that are currently branching out in the form of expanded universes crowding out a wider range of entertainment options, but in retrospect, 1977s Star Wars: A New Hope, is very understated in its simplicity.  A New Hope was just exciting enough at the time, to be revolutionary without collapsing under its own weight, as I fear Jodorowskys Dune would have.  My point is that A New Hope created enough excitement to spark an interest in genre films to result in some great films being made, until the big marketing machine got up to speed and created this new world of multiple expanded universe properties growing out of control.

Like Lynchs Dune, I believe that Jodorowskys version of Dune, regardless of its strengths, would have been a big goofy mess, but in a different way.",1528588800,,7972,4.757246376811594
