1256773,5,B000034DDT,"I have only seen ""Bloodmoon"" once but that was enough to know that it is hands down the best martial arts movie ever made.  The fight coreography is superb, the plot is entertaining, and the cinematography is unmatched.  It is simply the most underrated movie of all time and is a must have for any true movie fan.  I would recommend it to anyone!
Disclaimer:  The one time I saw ""Bloodmoon"" I was in an altered state of mind from a mix of wild plants and herbs and this actaully may not be the greatest action movie ever.  But I sure did like when I was all messed up!",1015804800,7,569,4.18348623853211
1256774,4,B000034DDT,"this is one the jewels among american chop socky films....the fight scenes a pretty darn good except for the weak wire work..gary daniels and ""eddie murphy""(heh heh) put on a good show....but our badguy was the kind i love ,real nasty.....hey did anyone catch ron van dame?",1005782400,2,273,4.829787234042553
1256775,5,B000034DDT,"How can you NOT love a film where one of the two detectives assigned to catch a mullet-wielding serial killer/ martial arts master is an amateur magician who produces strings of coloured handkerchiefs at murder scenes?  Bloodmoon combines another solid outing by Gary Daniels both as martial artist and actor with some really funny campiness.  I don't mean to say that Chuck Jeffreys turns in a bad performance either -- quite the opposite, he is hilarious.  In fact the whole movie is just a hoot.  It makes a great double-feature with Cold Harvest and is just as good for multiple viewings, but for different reasons than COld Harvest.  Also good to see Frank Gorshin, the Riddler from the Batman TV series show up with a pretty substantial roll as the bitter and beleaguered police chief.  Also probably features the goofiest serial killler of all times.",995241600,,857,4.875862068965517
1256776,5,B000034DDT,"Ahhh.....Bloodmoon.....Food for hungry martial art flick fanatics. I first caught this movie about 4 yrs ago on cable late one night at about 3:00 a.m. I fell asleep watching another program and woke up during the night and saw this movie showing and couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. The fights are choreographed in a very beautiful manner and the suspense factor was strong enough to keep me up until 4:00 am knowing that i had to get up for work at 7. I highly recommend this film to martial arts lovers everywhere...One thing that I would like to point out is not to let the names and the box fool you. I prefer classic styled,Shaw Brothers & Golden Harvest produced films for the most part ""with the exception of Bruce Lee,Jet Li & Jim Kelly"" because Van-Damme,Steven Seagal & Jeff Speakman movies and the likes of them just don't cut it with me, but Bloodmoon satisfied my thirst for a truly great fight flick. It's most definately worth a peek. I just wish i could find me a pair of steel heeled boots and two iron fingers like this guy had in the movie....He used them well",984096000,2,1088,4.445
1256777,4,B000034DDT,"Decent script, mostly decent acting, excellent fight scenes, professional production values, some good suspense sequences and an intriguing motive for the killer make this surprisingly enjoyable. I would certainly buy other martial arts movies made by the same team.",983664000,,266,5.846153846153846
1256778,5,B000034DDT,"The absolute best Martial arts flick ever ever! I watch it all the time now.  Daniels moves fast and hard in evry scene. there are enough fight scenes to keep your heart pumping to the end, each with world class  quality. Daniels is even better than he was in ""Fist of the North  Star"". This movie has blood laughs,garanteed smiles and flashy  swordwork. It will shock you, mezmorize you and will hynotise you with the  best in the world. Gary Daniels is the best and oh, gosh, this is amazing  even for him.",964137600,,508,4.408602150537634
1256779,4,B000034DDT,"This is got to be one of the best Gary Daniels movies that Ive seen so far.  The acting is bad, the story is bad, the special effects are bad, but the action and martial arts scenes are way above average.  Buy this movie  for those two reasons only because is definently delivers.  After this you  should buy Cold Harvest and Fist of the North Star. Those are also two of  Gary Daniels Best. (And when you watch Blood Moon keep in eye out for the  Boom Mike)its just hilarious!",951091200,,477,4.233333333333333
1256786,3,B000034DDT,"This is without a doubt the best Gary Daniels film ever made. But it's still a Gary Daniels film! It's a cheesy kung fu movie from the late 1990s starring an extremely bad actor. However, it's still fun to watch because it's so ridiculous. Chuck Jeffreys is perhaps the most ridiculous Eddie Murphy sidekick character ever, who somersaults and performs magic tricks at crime scenes. However, he and the tag-along adopted niece are far more adept at tracking the murderer than Gary is. Because this is a '90s film, the COMPUTERNET and an irreverent h4x0r are major plot devices, as are coming out of retirement and single parenthood. However, the cliches, and a bad Japanese accent, add to the comedy value. The fight scenes are decent, and there are quite a few of them, so this actually delivers on its promises of being a martial arts film. Watch this if you want to see how ridiculous '90s martial arts films could get, or if you want to see Gary Daniel's fighting skill without the cinematic pain that usually accompanies it.",1244073600,,1029,4.722222222222222
1256787,4,B000034DDT,"Gary Daniels (""Fist of the North Star"") plays Ken O'Hara, a retired police detective who used to specialize in serial killers.  Chuck Jeffreys (""Superfights"") plays Chuck Baker, a cop currently on the case of a serial killer (Darren Shahlavi, ""Tai Chi 2"") who beats top fighters to death with two metal fingers and a pair of steel-toed boots.  When no progress is made on the case, Baker's superior orders him to find O'Hara for some much needed help.  In order for there to be some obligatory friction between the two cops, Baker doesn't want a partner, and O'Hara has his own problems with family and (of course) ""the past"".

As a kid, I loved B-grade martial arts films, and if they were all like this I would still love them.  This is one of the better ones that I've seen.  Director Tony Leung Siu Hung handles the action more like a Hong Kong production than an American one.  The fights are far from the best but still well above average for this type of flick.  Now the action is where it excels, but the plot, dialogue, and pacing are pretty hilarious.  Under the circumstance the acting is probably a little better than it actually needs to be.  For a talented fighter, Chuck Jeffreys is a decent enough thespian and carries most of the dialogue.  The real treat though is Darren Shahlavi as the evil villain.  His moves are good, his facial expressions are priceless, and he should be doing more stuff.  He looks like some stoner that one might have witnessed playing frisbee in a random grassy area within 6 blocks of any major university in about 1995.

I don't really know who distributed this DVD.  I guess it's Genius Products.  The copy I have is not the one pictured.  The picture quality is fine; full-screen, but I'm not sure that this was ever shot with the intention of a theatrical release.  The special features are a joke.  ""Scene Access"" is not a special feature.  This was the last American movie done for Seasonal Films, who have been around since the mid-70s, and got their U.S. start with ""No Retreat, No Surrender"" in 1985.  Several more followed during the next decade and are becoming increasingly hard to find, as I had to settle for a used copy of this one.  If this is your thing, don't delay.

1256788,4,B000034DDT,"I first saw this film at a very young age and could never find it in my later years.  I finaly found it watched it and it still held my attention.  the bad guy has some awsome kicks in this 1980's film.  He is a bit of a creep but a great fighter.  I liked this because the star, gary daniels took some serious beating along with his co star, that is something you don't normally see in any kind of movie. This is a collectors item",1190678400,,431,3.9195402298850577
1256789,4,B000034DDT,"From the same guys that brought you the super-cheesefest ""Superfights"" comes another low-budget, high cheese quality martial arts action flick - Bloodmoon.  This time around, Gary Daniels is onboard and so are some incredible fight scenes that make this a pleasant improvement.

As Bloodmoon begins, so does the cheese.  We are introudeced to a goofy villain in a goofy costume, only known as ""The Killer"".  Also introuced, is a ridiculously looking red moon, supposed to be ""The Bloodmoon"" which The Killer fancies with dialouge ""Did you notice there is blood on the moon tonight?""  Supposedly it occurs when he is about to destroy one of his victims.  Ok, so the cheese is plenty.  If you can deal with it, we are also introduced to a smashing good fight at the beginning, only one of very many throughout this film.  A fight, like all rest, that goes on for minutes and can compare with the final showdowns in many movies.  Each fight throughout the movie gets better and longer.  The choreography is amazing, again from the same guy that choreographed Superfights, Tony Leung.

In addition to the great and improving fights, 1/2 way through the film, the story begins to take itself seriously, and finally gets quite interesting till the end.  Unfortunately, the end is honestly one of the stupidest finales I have ever seen, and its not the fight I am referring to.  The final fight, is around 8 minutes in lenght.  For comparison, that is about the length of the roof-top fight in Jackie Chan's ""Who Am I?"", arguably one of the best fight scenes ever.  Though not as entertaining as that scene, this is one of the better fights I have seen.  Obviously, the duel is between Gary Daniels and Darren Shahlavi (The Killer).  I am not familiar with Darren Shahlavi, but he presents himself in Bloodmoon with excellent martial arts skills as if he had been doing this for quite some time.  Gary Daniels, on the other hand, has earned a good repuation with many action films such as Ring of Fire, City Hunter, Rage, Riot, Firepower, and White Tiger to name a few.  A Gary Daniels fan will definetly want to add this to their collection.

I honestly have to give a 3-1/2 stars for this film overall.  Its the action that holds the spotlight here.  The low production of the rest of the film, makes it suffer, but not nearly as bad as Superfights.  The actors and story give a lot more effort this time around.  Cheese is the name of the game here.  Expect it to come, or you will be too distracted to enjoy the wonderful choreography all around it.",1182124800,,2546,4.642058165548098

1256792,3,B000034DDT,"As an action film, Bloodmoon succeeds in almost every aspect of what a martial arts movie is supposed to be. But from the perspective of a HK cinema fan, the film is constantly bogged down by the flaws of bad filmmaking and low-production quality due to a low-budget.

My advice to you, the viewer, is that when you buy this film to add to your collection or rent it from a local rental outlet, just sit back and relax, and enjoy the greatly improved style and quality of martial arts action that is hardly ever seen from a US production studio; Whatever you do, do not take this film seriously! And finally, when you get to the end of the film, be prepared for one of the worst endings ever conjured for an action film!

1256793,5,B000034DDT,"For pure martial arts/action flicks, Bloodmoon simply has to take the cake. Such a great story line, good acting, and stunning martial arts from a not so well known cast. Darren Shahlavi plays the evil ex champion who makes it his mission to kill high ranking martial arts champions one by one, and city by town. Thus enter Chuck Jeffreys, a police detective teamed up with an ex supercop played by Gary Daniels who must track down Shahlavi and bring him to justice. This is a HIGHLY underrated and overlooked movie which in production had a very limited budget, but delivers superb martial arts action, stunts, great storyline, and definately suspense to keep you in your seat within every single fightscene and obviously the final fight which is a superb climax to the film. In my opinion, Bloodmoon is one of the best martial arts films yet...",1069113600,5,846,4.761904761904762
1256794,4,B000034DDT,"Frankly, I bought this movie for one reason: Gary Daniels, who is one of the most amazingly pretty and appealing men ever created.
This movie is one of Gary's better ones. It has more of a plot than you normally get with a martial arts movie. There is an element of suspense above and beyond the martial arts cliche of loosely tying a bunch of fight scenes together and calling that a ""plot"". The plot isn't so fresh that you'll say ""Wow, I never saw anything like that story before"". But neither will you sit there thinking ""Did this movie even have a script writer?"". It should hold your attention throughout.
Gary looks exceptionally beautiful here, and even shows off his impressive physique somewhat in one scene. His hair style could be a little less squared-off in the bangs, but it's hard to criticize a man who is this handsome.
I'm not into martial arts per se, but I can see this one had a bit more ""pizzazz"" to the fight scenes than some of his other movies, so someone into martial arts will probably appreciate that aspect. There are a few ""Jackie Chan"" type of acrobatics to some of the fight moves, but without the usual Jackie Chan ""slapstick"".
If you want to see what one of the most flawlessly gorgeous men looks like, this is a good DVD to check out (although I think that Gary is even prettier in some of his other movies, due to the not-particularly-flattering hair style in this one).",1052611200,2,1407,4.5

Awesome fight choreography and underrated action heroes? - you got it. Atrocious acting and an obviously cheap budget? - well, they've improved on that, but by and large, yes. Like the films that came before it, ""Bloodmoon"" is not for everybody, but those of you committed to the core essentials of kung fu movies ought not be without this one.

The story: Detective Chuck Baker (Chuck Jeffreys,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superfights/dp/B00009B8BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superfights</a>) is stumped on the case of a kung fu-practicing serial killer (Darren Shahlavi,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ip-Man-2-Legend-of-the-Grandmaster/dp/B004I1AGTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ip Man 2: Legend of the Grandmaster</a>) targeting various other martial masters. He turns to retired ""mindhunter"" Ken O'Hara (Daniels,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fist-of-the-North-Star/dp/B0001US7MW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fist of the North Star</a>) to help him understand and track down the killer before he starts targeting those close to both policemen.

I admit it:  the story is one for the dogs. The thought of any character played by Gary Daniels utilizing brains over brawn is laughable, and luckily the movie realizes this as well before it can get too carried away with itself. The acting's not exactly about to win anybody awards: the highlight is Frank Gorshin (the Riddler from the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman/dp/B0016MOWPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman</a>&nbsp;series) in scenes wherein he yells at Chuck Jeffreys. This is certainly funnier than the filmmakers' attempts to make the Jeffreys/Daniels team something akin to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/48-Hrs/dp/6305252572/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">48 Hrs</a>: the two of them don't have bad chemistry, but it's nothing out of the ordinary either and not at all comparable to Murphy/Nolte or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tucker-Chan/dp/B004H83IOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tucker/Chan</a>. Gary Daniels' accent only punctuates his weak acting chops, and Jeffreys isn't very inspired either. Darren Shahlahvi as the killer and Brandie Rocci as O'Hara's martial artist niece, however, take the cake for giving the impression that they couldn't even order a cheeseburger convincingly.

Luckily, we don't care about that. The fight scenes (done by director Tony Leung, who'd later rock Donnie Yen's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ip-Man/dp/B003INBNXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ip Man</a>) are an absolute delight if that's what you're looking for. There are seven ""real"" fights, with a few quickies interspersed here and there, and with the exception of the instance where the killer absolutely dominates pro wrestler Rob Van Dam, they are all top-notch and fully deserving of recognition, if you ask me. Even part-time actors like Brandie Rocci and Ken Kensei (who has an absolutely dazzling swordfight with the killer) get to mix it up alongside proven talent like Hakim Alston (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>) in battles that will knock the socks off of newcomers to the series and even manage to impress old fans. I cannot stress just how effectively these approximate twenty minutes of cumulative action save the rest of the movie from oblivion; coming from someone who's seen all of the ""No Retreat, No Surrender"" films, I can say with confidence that the fights in this film are the very best in all of the series - the best choreographed, executed, and edited.

More noticeably than even that, however, is the overall jump in quality that the film brings to this pseudo-series. Even the most endearing fan of ""No Retreat, No Surrender"" movies cannot deny that they were a patchwork, barely held together by weak production values that were commonplace in Hong Kong but undoubtedly alienated some western viewers. While not looking like more than your average DTV film, ""Bloodmoon"" looks infinitely more solid and palatable - less grainy and more like a professional film. It's the cumulative film produced in the image Ng See Yuen...and if you didn't know who that is or why it's a good thing before you started reading this review, then you might be looking at the wrong movie.",1254614400,,5194,6.863636363636363
