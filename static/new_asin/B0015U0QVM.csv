8260000,5,B0015U0QVM,"This 3 Signature Classic Collection starts with the movie Port of New York. 1949 B&W this is one of Brynner's first movie appearances wherein he plays a ruthless drug smuggler.  His role is not the dominant character in this movie, but it's enjoyable and entertaining considering the year and subject matter.  Death Rage is the next movie in this collection and typical 1976 mob style with '70's music and subject matter done to death.  Brynner is his best in this type of role.  The ultimate tough man with not too complicated a dialogue.  Foll. this is Poppies Are Also Flowers, the subject matter similar to Port of New York but interestingly it opens in Afghanistan.  Some things never change. Brynner's role in this movie is very small, with two other primary characters dominating.",1230249600,19,787,4.879699248120301

POPPIES ARE ALSO FLOWERS--  Narcotics agents irradiate a shipment of heroin, hoping to trace it to the main distributor. U.N.-made film aimed at stopping the illegal drug trade is top-heavy with stars and light on plot, despite a story by Ian Fleming.
