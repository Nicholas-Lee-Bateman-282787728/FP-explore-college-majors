8290801,4,B001D11A2C,"This ""Silver Screen II: Goddesses"" caught my eye the minute I saw it! I was eager to Bio channel biographies of the seduction queen Marilyn Monroe, the beautiful Elizabeth Taylor, and the Italian beauty Sophia Loren.

DISC ONE
*""Marilyn Monroe: The Mortal Goddess"" = From the tragic early life, to the young struggling days in Hollywood, and the international fame of the most famous actress in Hollywood history: Marilyn Monroe.

*""Elizabeth Taylor: Facets"" = Elizabeth Taylor is one of the few actresses that defined the word ""star"" for over six decades. From childhood stardom in the 1940s, to adulthood stardom in the 1950s and 1960s, Taylor shined until her 2011 death. P.S. THIS BIO WAS MADE BEFORE TAYLOR'S DEATH!

DISC TWO
*""Sophia Loren"" = No other Italian actress could express the beauty and fame of Sophia Loren. From her hurtful childhood, to her Italian and American film fame, to a woman who still shines with beauty today, this biography is somewhat briefer than the others included in this set--but still worth watching!

**The only thing I don't like about this set is that Angelina Jolie was included. I must admit that I have never been a big fan of Jolie and I was very disapointed in this biography! In my opinion, Jolie is no ""goddess"" and that I think her bio could've been replaced with a bio on Jayne Mansfield, Joan Collins, Jane Russell, Grace Kelly, Lana Turner, Rita Hayworth, Audrey Hepburn, etc.

***I strongly suggest that if you love Miss Monroe, Miss Taylor, or Miss Loren that your order this low priced set. But even if you're a fan of Jolie, don't go looking fo much!!!",1350259200,,1607,4.787003610108303
