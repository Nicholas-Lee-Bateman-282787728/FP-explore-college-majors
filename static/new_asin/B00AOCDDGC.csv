5463211,5,B00AOCDDGC,"Let's be real, I got this only for the Princess and the Goblin which is one of the hardest movies to find. It is exactly as I hoped from my childhood and for how old the movie is, it is still great and nostalgia filled. Of course the other films aren't Disney, you can tell from the cover, so if that is what you were hoping for, read the description and look at the cover. If, like me, you wanted the movie for The Princess and the Goblin, fear not, it is the correct one!",1491177600,4,473,3.9894736842105263

5463222,5,B00AOCDDGC,"This is an incredible find. I bought this primarily for the fact it had ""Princess and The Goblin"", a movie I discovered was difficult to find especially for a reasonable price. I was skeptical it would be the correct movie despite the cover art being the same considering most the movies are lesser known versions of the classic princess movies, but I was pleased to find out after purchasing that it was the movie I was looking for. So not only did I get this classic movie for MUCH less than I could find it anywhere else, I got 9 other movies with it.",1474675200,27,554,4.336538461538462

5463237,5,B00AOCDDGC,"DEFINTELY don't pay $30... get it at walmart, kmart, or best buy from the $5 movie bin.

Now, that said, this unexpected gem is actually worth your $5 if you have kids who enjoy fairy tales, or if you yourself enjoy fairy tales! These are obviously not the Disney versions, but they stick closely to the original fables and it is actually pretty cool to see the truer versions of these classic stories. They are obviously low budget, but not half as bad as I was expecting. The visuals and sound effects seem very anime-esqe to me. The stories flow and the writing and voice acting isn't half bad. I rolled my eyes when I saw that a family member had bought this, but put any one of these movies on and I'm glued to it! Lol. They actually capture and hold my attention well. I'm an avid Disney fan and know all the Disney princess films inside and out, but these are so unlike the Disney versions that I am hardly even compelled to compare the two, and it's fun that these movies have the original unexpected aspects if you are used to the Disney tellings of the fairy tales.

The 10 movie pack is great for long car trips and portable dvd players since there are several movies on one disc, but I actually think it's worth having at home to watch on a sick day or lazy evening. Just don't pay more than $5!",1442534400,2,1307,4.287449392712551

5463241,5,B00AOCDDGC,It's enjoyable movie!!,1425686400,,22,6.666666666666667
5463242,4,B00AOCDDGC,"If you are planning on buying this set because of Princess and the Goblin is much cheaper here than getting it separately, it'll be a toss up if u get it or not. There was recently another version of this set released, it's completely the same, the packaging/font/layout, even most of the movies are the same. Notice how I said most. Strangely, this set was re-released with The Princess and the Goblin replaced by Alice in Wonderland. There is no way of knowing which set you'll be getting, unless you find this set in person. This can be found at Walmart in the $5 bin. My Walmart had both versions, but when I went back I unfortunately was only able to find the 2nd set. So be warned.

Now on to the movies themselves. Idk why everyone calls these movies ""knockoffs"". Sure, the covers were mostly designed into fooling buyers into thinking they were buying the Disney versions, and some of the characters may resemble those films. But as if Disney is only allowed to make fairy tales. These tales are hundreds of years old. Just because Disney did them well and is most well known doesn't make everything else a knock off.

The stories represented here are all stories Disney has done before, but these are for the most part the ORIGINAL TALES AS THEY WERE WRITTEN. They are almost nothing like their Disney counterparts. Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, Alice in Wonderland, and Aladdin are just a few that follow the original take so closely and it's then you realize how far Dusney strays. I very much enjoyed seeing the original versions of these tales, and the animation wasn't great, hardly above Saturday morning animation, but it wasn't the worst, and almost none of these have any singing so that's a plus. Only The Little Princess included songs, and Cinderella had one duet. They're all 45 mins or shorter so they're completely harmless.

Except for The Frog Prince. That doesn't follow the original tale, and wasn't even made in America. It was designed specifically as a knock off, unlike the other films here. It should not be included. Don't waste your time with that one.",1425686400,6,2091,4.676630434782608
