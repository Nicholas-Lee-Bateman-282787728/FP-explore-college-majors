8281802,5,B001B3LIRY,"This dvd is very easy to follow and full of positive, encouragement for children practicing yoga.  It is especially great for starters!",1265932800,,135,5.136363636363637
8281803,5,B001B3LIRY,"I have a 5 year old boy and a 2 year old girl. They LOVE this video. It is perfect for their age range. My son started out very frustrated because he couldn't do many of the poses (he is a perfectionist even at 5). The nice thing about the video is it's not about how well the kids to them, it's that they ""promise to try their best"". He is beginning to see that it can be fun even if you aren't perfect. I have noticed he is getting better at his poses (he does a beautiful Warrior I). I highly recommend this video for the very young yogis!!!",1259625600,,544,3.9545454545454546
8281804,2,B001B3LIRY,"I am sorry to rate this so low but I just finished doing this with my 7 year old daughter and was surprised to see how boring this video is. The poses in the end are way too challenging to be useful (Bakasana and Tittibhasana). And, okei, the kids are cute but we ended up fast forwarding the kids section to the next pose. I would like to find a fluid yoga program that I could do with my child instead of a list of asanas. But if you want to learn one pose at a time then I suppose this is okei.",1256428800,2,497,3.8349514563106797
8281805,5,B001B3LIRY,"This is a great video. Keeps kids (and adults obviously) involved while learning poses FROM OTHER KIDS! Teaches 12 poses, it's timely, fun and informative. My son's preschool loved it!",1234569600,3,184,5.166666666666667
