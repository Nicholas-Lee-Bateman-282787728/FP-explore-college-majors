8168096,1,B000CNDJVM,"Bruce Kamich has written a couple of excellent books, and I was very interested to get his take on Point & Figure charting. This, as it turns out, is the video of a half hour presentation. The first twenty minutes are devoted to a not terribly interesting overview of the technique's history. The final ten offer an obviously extremely cursory overview of a couple of chart formations; more detail could easily be found online. I initially thought that this might be worth five bucks, but on thinking it over, a buck would be my limit. I'm really annoyed at having paid 29.95; anyone paying the publisher's list price (79.95, I believe) will feel violated. The books by Jeremy Du Plessis and Thomas Dorsey both offer much (almost infinitely) more for a similar price.",1388448000,,767,4.774436090225564
