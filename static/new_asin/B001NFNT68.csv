8326745,2,B001NFNT68,Film Detective version is not good. Video and audio quality were very promising until midway in the film at that point the video goes crazy and is messed up for nearly 10 min. I thought it was just the copy I had purchased but the second copy I got was identical. Obviously the master is corrupt so as far as getting a nice restored version forget it. This version is also a cut down version for television at only 53 min not the 57 min as stated on the case. By the way the Alpha Video version is pretty bad also it has bad ghosting from a bad master tape copy. As for the movie itself it is one of the better Roy Rogers films and I wish there were better copies available. Too bad.,1484956800,,683,4.066666666666666

8326751,5,B001NFNT68,"The Carson City Kid, 1940 film

Gold was discovered in 1849 California and attracted a hundred thousand men and women, including wild and untamed spirits. [No mention of those who sailed from Australia and brought the phrase Kangaroo Court.] Riders attack a Wells Fargo stagecoach, one man says the Carson City Kid. A woman sings while musicians play in a tavern. A posse is formed to search for the Carson City Kid. Two men stop at a cabin; the owner brags about his wealth (not wise). The two leave to avoid the posse. A chase adds action! One rider is caught, they search the back trail for the other. Gabby donates his horse to the Carson City Kid. [Note the people on the street. This is accurate but rare in westerns then.] That fellow can shoot. He is hired as a guard for the tavern. Gabby has an excuse for what happened. [A lesson here?]

Jessup welcomes a visitor to Sonora. Scott Warren did well at the poker table (at first). [Note Jessups smile.] Scott plays poker with Jessup. [Note the switch to a cold deck by the waiter, then the card switching. Never gamble with strangers is always good advice.] Jessup fires the singer and the guard because they are too friendly. Somebody robs Jessups safe! They see who did it and ride after him. [A chase for action!] Scott is captured. They form a line-up for identification. Laramie identifies the man with a bruise on his face. [A lesson here?] The trial begins. The Carson City Kid shows up to identify Morgan Reynolds and tell what he did to his brother. There is shooting and rough justice. Scott is freed. Gabby was shot, but recovers for a humorous event. And so there is a happy ending for the good guys.

This is an entertaining and educational story about gambling and the identification of a criminal suspect. It has singing, music, and comedy.",1409788800,,1813,4.589506172839506
8326752,1,B001NFNT68,"This rating applies to the Alpha DVD only, not to the film itself.
THE CARSON CITY KID (1940) is a 57 minute film cut down to 53 minutes on Alpha's DVD. If that weren't bad enough, the picture is so blurry, faded and indistinct it's impossible to enjoy. It looks like a 16mm dupe transferred to VHS, which is probably the source. No picture in such poor quality should ever be considered for selling on home video. To add insult to injury, there is a large and annoying watermark that keeps popping up in the corner to remind us of the brand name. Alpha specializes in low-priced DVD's but this one is not worth paying for at any price.",1356566400,3,636,4.352941176470588
8326753,3,B001NFNT68,I returned this movie .I was lookink for a full length version. The description said it was 88 minutes long it was probably 53. Other than that it arrived promptly and in good condition.,1337731200,2,186,4.5
