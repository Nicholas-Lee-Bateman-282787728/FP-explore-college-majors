8406458,5,B003V668E2,Love this DVD collection!  I take classes at a local studio but wanted this DVD set for practicing at home.  Very happy with my purchase.  She is a great instructor and very easy to follow.  Highly recommend!,1396224000,,208,4.54054054054054
8406459,5,B003V668E2,"These are a great resource for the times when I just can't get my head around the moves being taught in my pole class. Jamilla does a great job of breaking down the moves and showing the step by step. The strength building exercises are also very effective. If you're interested in pole fitness, this is a great set of DVDs for your library.",1387324800,,341,4.34375
8406460,5,B003V668E2,"Ok, I am BRAND NEW to the pole. Never Ever have I stepped foot or hand near a pole and watching the first DVD I was able to do the first 4 moves extremely quickly.  She breaks it down step by step and is so clear and easy to understand.  I was shocked at how easily I flowed, I don't know if I just have it in me or if it really is that simple. Of course I'm only on the first 4 moves so I cannot review the rest right now but I'm a happy camper.",1375574400,2,446,3.5876288659793816
8406461,5,B003V668E2,Bought these for my wife to help her learn how to use a pole I also got her. So far she's really into it and I can't wait to get home from deployment to see what she's learned :). Could really spice up the bedroom so I'd recommend them.,1369699200,,236,3.836734693877551
8406462,5,B003V668E2,Very nicely and professionally done. Easy to follow and engaging. One not so cool feature is that it only comes in DVD..not a very useful format considering that you might want to watch the tutorials at the gym from your ipad.,1357171200,,226,4.536585365853658
8406463,2,B003V668E2,I was expecting the dvd to last longer and to have more information. She does give good advice on pole techniques.,1335052800,,114,4.476190476190476
8406464,4,B003V668E2,"I bought these DVDs about 9 months ago and I still haven't even opened the 4th and 5th DVDs. If you can't do inversions, the 3rd DVD is going to be your stopping point. She describes how to do inversions really well, but it could take you months to get good at them, especially if you are self-teaching. If you are particularly skilled and a fast learner, i definitely recommend these DVDs. Jamilla is a great teacher and very elegant in all of her moves. She breaks down even move intricately and gives you options on how to modify the move for any skill level/strength.",1326240000,6,571,4.447619047619048
8406465,5,B003V668E2,"This DVD collection is an excellent resource for both the beginning student and for the intermediate/advanced dancer looking to expand.  All the moves are broken down into easy to understand pieces and routines into manageable segments.  Very classy & professionally done!  I would recommend this to anyone starting pole fitness / pole dancing.

FYI - Pole fitness WILL transform your body (and your mind)!  Don't give up at first ...it is NOT easy (although it looks easy when the pro's do it) ..but it is the most FUN you will have working out!  ENJOY!",1310947200,16,554,4.840425531914893
8406466,5,B003V668E2,I have tried to danced before but was never taught technique...These videos are awesome... Everything is broken down and you can enjoy it at your own pace...Highly recommend:-),1306972800,8,176,5.321428571428571
8406467,5,B003V668E2,"I would definatly recommend these DVDs to anyone who wants to get into pole dancing or if you already dance and want to learn some new things...

Keeping in mind that eventually these moves look like they do get very extreme and would require many many hours of dedication. It keeps you occupied and challenged, but it is much fun!

Good Luck Have Fun to anyone who also chooses to purchase this set :)",1306195200,10,402,4.418918918918919
