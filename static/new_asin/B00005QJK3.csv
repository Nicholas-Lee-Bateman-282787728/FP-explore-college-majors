7950691,5,B00005QJK3,"In PLAYGIRL KILLER (1967), three questions immediately spring to mind: #1- Who needs a speargun on a rowboat in a small lake? #2- Who, in their right mind, goes for a ride in a rowboat w/ a guy w/ a speargun? #3- Who, but some absolute maniac, wears white socks w/ sandals on a rowboat, or anywhere else? So, it's no wonder that the cackling brunette, out w/ the white-socked maniac, gets a gut piercing. Then, French accordion -the devil's instrument- music plays as said maniac, named Bill (William Kerwin- BLOOD FEAST, TWO THOUSAND MANIACS, A TASTE OF BLOOD) makes his escape. Next, we're introduced to Bob (Neil Sedaka???), Arlene (Jean Christopher), and Betty (Linda Christopher). These are three swinging kids! They have a big pool bash, complete w/ some brain-impaled version of Herman's Hermits! And yes, Sedaka sings! Annd yes, everyone does the Waterbug! Whooo! Go on, now! Annnd yes, a strip-tease erupts, as was common practice at pool parties of the later 1960's. We see Neil Sedaka in bed. With no shirt. Then, he and Betty are off to college. Arlene, all alone at the mansion, soon enlists the help of wandering Bill, in order to get her garage door unstuck! This leads to a job for Bill! And yes, he dons the sock / sandal combo. Arlene does her best to seduce the schmuck, but he just gets angry. He's an artist, and has an artistic temperament. So, when he's sketching you, don't pi$$ him off! Arlene spends much of her time prancing about, half naked, like a cat. Like a cat, I tells ya! Bill watches her. A lot. A saxophone plays! Bill can take no more prancing! Poor Arlene! Setting up shop at the mansion, A woman named Pat stops by for Arlene, and is un-phased by Bill or his leather-strapped stockings of pure eeevil! Poor Pat. Bill goes out on the town, in Arlene's aircraft carrier-sized Cadillac. Does his madness know no bounds?! Will no one stop him before he inflicts more of his sketches on humanity? Can't Neil Sedaka show up and sing at him?? In the end, Bill gets his comeuppance, but those be-sandaled, white cotton foot coverings will haunt my dreams forevermore!... EXTRA POINTS- For counting all the times when Bill goes pop-eyed! No one, except maybe a bearded frog, stares at a phone w/ more insane eye-bulging!...",1505174400,2,2254,4.680100755667507
7950692,5,B00005QJK3,"I love this cult classic. It took me back to 1974, before cable & internet- when people read T.V. Guide and looked forward to watching a Saturday Night movie at home from there television set.",1485993600,,192,4.514285714285714
7950693,5,B00005QJK3,"Playgirl Killer was released in 1968. It starred Neil Sedaka. Made between his two most popular periods of music fame, Neil only does one song The Waterbug. The film is a mixture of rock and roll and horror . Fans of Neil Sedaka will like this the most.",1479600000,,253,4.291666666666667
7950694,5,B00005QJK3,"Oh yeah - SO much fun!!!
You haven't lived until you've seen Neil Sedaka sing ""Water Bug"". William Kerwin who wrote, directed, and starred in this has some really interesting ideas of what women are like! Total popcorn-fest B flick. Enjoy!",1434585600,,239,4.853658536585366
7950695,5,B00005QJK3,As I remembered it as a child but even scarier now that I got to see it from beginning to end.  This is a true classic horror film for the 60's-70's generation.,1338854400,,160,4.0
7950696,4,B00005QJK3,"Playgirl Killer is a seedy, burlesque-style, sexploitation film from an era when everyone smoked and listened to mod jazz.

It was a movie that was on all the time when I was younger (like Bad Ronald) but then completely disappeared by the time the '80s rolled in.

As a kid I was always drawn to the music of films, especially horror films and films like this from the '50s, '60s and '70s.

Neil Sedaka is in this film which is kinda neat.

The main character is a tempermental artist who becomes murderous when his young beautiful models move.  He winds up freezing them so that they cannot move, thus, allowing him to finish his masterpiece painting.

The painting is the common thread of the movie and has a very eerie look to it - that was the thing about this movie that stuck in my mind after all these years since I last saw it.  It gives the movie a Night Gallery feel.

The movie is not great but most of these movies back then were not going to be winning any awards.  They just mark an era that has a charm all to itself.

I am older and some may not agree with me but I rather watch a movie like this then most of the movies that are coming out today.

If you are in to this sort of thing the movie is worth seeing.",1229385600,3,1228,4.139240506329114
7950697,2,B00005QJK3,"This is almost a hoot. Done right it could have been a cult classic. ""Playgirl Killer"" is a low brow and low budget thriller with enough cheesy moments to keep you entertained even when it's story sags (which it does often). The slim plot involves a crazed artist who feels drawn to murder his models whenever they are incapable of keeping still. Which seems to be all the time. The film doesn't really cover much more ground than this, it starts at some arbitrary point, charts the killers progress for a few days, and ends when he reaches a timely and ""ironic"" downfall.

However there are some real laughs to be had along the way, because, if nothing else, ""Playgirl Killer"" is a really bad film. Although competently filmed, you couldn't really say that the director had any particular flair, and some of the acting is really dreadful - although it doesn't reach the lows seen in the HG Lewis gore epics from the same period. The film starts off with a murder, which is actually the only moment of graphic violence in the whole movie, and from that point we meet some swinging teens, watch them dance, flirt and attend a music show, all of which is entirely pointless. After about half on hour of this, the crazed artist manages to get himself into the home of one of them, a particularly annoying girl called Arlene who has the worst approach to flirting ever seen. The film spends many long moments showing Arlene walk around in a swimsuit or change clothes very awkwardly (there is no nudity in the film at all so it's all kind of pointless), untill the killer finally gets to the point where he can stand no more (like the audience) and murders her.

From this point on, the film starts to get funnier as a succession of dopey gals somehow turn up and get the same treatment. My favourite victim is a really wooden starlet who turns up in what seems to be an old lady's Sunday outfit to answer a newspaper ad for home help. She can't act at all, and the 15 minutes or so in which she appears on screen are the most hilarious of the entire film (not least because of her jaw-droppingly ugly underwear in the supposedly ""sexy"" scene when she changes for a swim).

There's a weak attempt to inject mystery into the proceedings as the artist confesses to a strange dream that may be influencing his behaviour, but it never amounts to much. Even the promised rage at models moving while he's drawing never leads directly to their murder, he just gets angry, and then maybe kills them hours or even days later when it seems convenient to him. He doesn't even try to sketch the job applicant girl at all, but he still murders her, so the logic is all over the place.

To sum up, this is just a load of daft eye candy about a mad artist and some girls that he menaces ad kills. All the girls are annoying in the extreme, and while none of them are really ugly, they don't warrant the amount of footage devoted to recording them prancing about and putting different nightgowns on, which is what Arlene seems to do ALL the time, in fact the pointless shots of her in particular probably account for about 50% of the film's entire running time. Sadly because of the lack of any gore, ""Playgirl Killer"" comes across as a kind of HG Lewis wannabe without any of the excess - no gore, no nudity just bad acting and long sequences of padding. Just about good enough for die-hard ""bad movie"" lovers, but very unlikely to maintain the interest of a wider audience. Also suffers from a really, REALLY terrible sleeve on this DVD release, I mean this modern glamour girl image with a knife hastily photo-shopped into her hand doesn't even match the content (the models are not the murderers here)...I just wish people who peddled this stuff would treat their audience with respect and use some of the films genuine period advertising.",1211846400,6,3823,4.512265512265512
7950698,4,B00005QJK3,"In the 60's there was a brief spate of films depicting crazed artists that excelled at murdering women (""Track of the Vampire"",""Color Me Blood Red"", etc).
William Kerwin (aka Thomas Sweetwood) takes a break from the Herschell Gordon Lewis movies to star in this classic tale of a handsome, talented artist who gets hired to be a handyman at a spoiled, rich girl's estate.
Unfortunately, Kerwin only likes girls for murdering. Needless to say, they're all foxy and are ready to jump him at the drop of a hat . He asks them to pose for him instead and then goes ballistic whenever they fidget! His face twitches uncontrollably and he stammers ""Don't move! Don't move!"" He kills them all (one scene with a harpoon gun) and wails ""I told you not to move!""
Filmed in gorgeous Montreal, Canada on a Herschell-friendly  budget, this movie has a brief appearance by Neil Sedaka in a small bathing suit, which may very well be the most frightening image in the movie.
The DVD transfer is excellent, surprisingly so given the budget and the age of the film. So when can we expect a DVD of the splendid ""Nightmare In Wax""?",1050105600,10,1111,4.611111111111111
