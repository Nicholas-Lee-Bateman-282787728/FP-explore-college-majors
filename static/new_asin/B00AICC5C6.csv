8552114,5,B00AICC5C6,"This was a great review.  I was very impressed and learned alot.  I was not real excited at first to watch a dvd, but it was very worth while.  I would recommend this to any one.  It was nice to have at our hospital were many of us could go.",1398902400,,241,3.76
8552115,5,B00AICC5C6,"Yes, I know the price looks high. But keep in mind it covers ten people. My hospital(Pediatric) offered it this year and a bunch of us took it. We have over a 95% pass rate on the CPEN with those who took this review. Although, I'm usually not a huge fan of watching videos this guy is engaging and gives real life tips that you can use in your practice.",1360886400,,354,4.071428571428571
8552116,5,B00AICC5C6,"This kit is a ER Manager's dream. I know of no way else to get 10 staff prepared for the CPEN for $1200. Even better, Peds-r-us may be able to decrease that amount with a grant they have. Anyone who has seen Scott present, knows why he is considered an expert in emergency pediatric care. Give this kit a try. You won't be disappointed.",1359158400,,336,4.265625
