8705839,3,B00UGPLW7O,"Bride of the Gorilla - Not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but decent B-Movie fluff that will entertain. Programmers might have been Lon Chaney's fate by this point in his career, but I believe ""High Noon"" was still on the horizon.

In any event, Lon usually gave a capable performance no matter what subpar material he was stuck with. Raymond Burr as the lead is capable, if the transformations into the actual ""Ape-Man"" leave something to be desired. And Barbara Payton, is certainly easy on the eyes.

Decent B-film entertainment...

The Amazing Transparent Man - Another quick cheapie I'm not too sure about, as far as what studio produced it or who was actually in the movie. Pretty underwhelming entertainment--the first film was pretty much my only reason for getting this DVD.",1510099200,,801,4.9185185185185185
