8296394,4,B001E4USS0,I had a hard time finding this but I had to have it to complete my cannibal collection. The nice thing is that this version has the English dubbing thankfully! The original version I had years ago was in Italian only with English subs. Its not a Mateii movie without the funny dubbing. This one is slow in some parts. Land of Death(cannibals vs.commandos) was non stop funny and action all the way through. This movie is like the second half of Cannibal Holocaust where as Land of Death is like the first half. If you are seeking this out you gotta troll like mad. If you are buying it from this page MAKE SURE you ask if it has the same cover like the one above! There is another movie with the same title which is the very lame and non violent Cannibal Holocaust 2 which was released on Vipco in the U.K.Don`t confuse the two. Always ask questions before you buy this particular movie because you can end up with the wrong one.,1405296000,,929,4.314285714285714
8296395,4,B001E4USS0,"This film is very good, almost exactly like cannibal holocaust, but it is not as classic as the origional in my opinion.  The blood guts and nudity are all there though, and gore hounds won't be dissapointed.  Its still a fun movie (if you think this kind of movie is fun) to watch with a bunch of friends, and for hardcore fans of Cannibal Holocaust this is a must see!",1218412800,4,370,4.271428571428571
