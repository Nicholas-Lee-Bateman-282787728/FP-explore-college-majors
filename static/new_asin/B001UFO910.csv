8343548,5,B001UFO910,I was unfamiliar with Anne Burrell but I enjoyed watching her on this dvd.  She is pleasant and entertaining to watch.  The other two were boring as hell.,1423872000,,154,4.464285714285714
8343549,2,B001UFO910,"I bought this as a gift, thinking it was an episode per chef and it was only ONE meal. That's it. One of the meals was just a desert. I would not get the 3 chef collection again.",1360886400,2,178,3.710526315789474
8343550,4,B001UFO910,I gave this to my mom and she loves watching them.  She isn't able to get cable and loves cooking shows.,1358467200,,104,3.9523809523809526
8343551,3,B001UFO910,i do have to admit that when i ordered this item...i thought it was a cook book {i did not read the specs}. After watching it i like it. The details are great and the recipies are fun. You can see just what your supposed to be doing before hand.,1254787200,6,245,3.92
