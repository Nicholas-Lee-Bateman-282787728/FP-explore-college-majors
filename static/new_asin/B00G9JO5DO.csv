8621494,1,B00G9JO5DO,"What really sucks is that I personally know one of the actors in this film and they weren't told ahead of time that they were being used to later be made fun of. They were under the impression this movie was going to be a real film, even if low-budget...and that the film maker's intent was to make the film and everyone involved look good. Instead, the actors were paid only gas money to participate thinking they were helping their own acting careers...only to find later that the film maker used every bad take possible, intentionally setting them up to be used and then later mocked for profit.

The only thing ""Crappy"" about this movie is how the film maker went about making it...and how years later they post the actors' names here calling them crappy actors. Hopefully, even fans of ""bad films"" will reconsider before ever actually spending their money to support this.",1483315200,,877,4.694805194805195
