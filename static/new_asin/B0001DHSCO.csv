1990943,3,B0001DHSCO,"After reading the reviews, I was expecting a pretty good work out from this DVD.  It's not difficult at all.  I'm an advanced walker and have been using Leslie Sansone's walking DVD's for about 5 years now along with some of her weight lifting and toning workouts.  I decided to try this Pilates DVD after reading the reviews but it's not what I expected.  I can do the whole routine without feeling any strain at all.  So don't buy it expecting a great workout.  That said, I like the DVD.  It's a nice easy Sunday workout to use between church services.  It's only 30 minutes long, won't get you all sweaty so that you need a shower and have to redo your hair and makeup but it gives the muscles a little boost and makes you feel that you at least did a mild workout.  I own about 20 of Leslie's DVD's and do one a day.  The excercises on this DVD are fun and gives you some variation from her other workouts.  I don't think Leslie was at her best here, however.  She wants you to practice your breathing during ""the hundredth"" but she doesn't count it out at a consistent pace.  Sometimes I don't finish exhaling before she's saying to inhale because she counted faster than she had the first two times...  Also she does something similar during the ""single leg stretch"", she wants you to hold each leg for two counts.  She starts out great: one, two - switch, one two - switch.  Then her mind seems to wander and she starts counting to two before you've fully pulled your leg to your chest and starts counting like: onetwo, onetwo, onetwo, real quick so you're not holding the poses long enough and, therefore, not getting the full benefit of the excercise.  It got a little annoying, I was wondering what she was thinking about.  But, as I said before, it's a nice change and good, short, mild excercise routine for a Sunday afternoon.  I like the excercises themselves.",1441497600,3,1875,4.44574780058651
1990964,5,B0001DHSCO,"Leslie delivers once again.  I have 3 other Pilates DVDs, but find myself actually doing this one several times a week.  She has a very nice way about her, and I really love this as well as her walking DVDs.

1990966,5,B0001DHSCO,I purchased a beginners Pilates DVD by another instructor but could not keep up.  When I saw this DVD by Leslie Sasone I was really excited and a bit timid.  Excited because I have a number of her walking DVD's and I know how personable she is and how easy she breaks down each segment of her work outs. Timid because I thought this would be her version of Pilates.  I was not disappointed; she really broke down each move and I found it easy to keep up; the moves she does is exactly the same as what you would get in any Pilates class.,1436227200,10,537,4.095238095238095

1990969,5,B0001DHSCO,I used this tape for several years in a group at an RV park.  Decided I needed to have a copy at home.  This is a good tape.  Takes 30 min. to do the regular pilates plus the mat work.  It really is a good stretch better than the chiropractor.,1432512000,,243,3.8

1991012,5,B0001DHSCO,"I did it and it is soooo not intimidating! I enjoying the way she teaches and I feel confident doing the exercises. She has a tutorial, about 15 minutes, then a regular session, and then a more advanced. I haven't gotten to the advanced yet, but after the regular sessions, I really feel it the next day. It truly doesn't seem like it is that much of a workout, but I am starting to see a difference.
Leslie Sansone is calm, speaks clearly, and explains things in a way most people can understand.
Highly recommend!",1394236800,5,515,4.431578947368421
1991013,2,B0001DHSCO,"Leslie Sansone, as always, gives clear instructions. But I would have preferred more adaptations for a newbie to Pilates. For example, it's very hard on the neck. What should I do to prevent that? Also, rolling up from a flat, straight-leg, position is hard on the lower back. I would have liked a variation to that move. Of course, I wouldn't want her to be sued by Joseph Pilates!",1391990400,5,382,4.550724637681159

1991040,5,B0001DHSCO,"I like this video, I thought it would be difficult but really it wasn't too hard.  I'm going to start doing this three to four times a week I think with my ""Walk Your Belly Flat"" DVD since that is my favorite so far.  Leslie definitely is motivating and this is a great beginner video",1373846400,,284,4.1454545454545455

1991042,5,B0001DHSCO,"What I like about Leslie's workouts is that she breaks everything down for you and makes it so approachable. If you are new to exercise or do not generally feel confident working out, her dvds are great. They are gentle in the sense that she will show you different ""levels"" to try. You really can go at your own pace. Leslie is also a wonderful teacher in that she will educate you on the terminology. She is very clear about what she's showing you and giving you reasoning for why she would lead you in such a movement/exercise. If you know nothing about pilates, after finishing this dvd you will be well informed about some basic moves and what parts of the body it helps strengthen. She will talk you through everything. Buying this dvd helped me build confidence at home before going to a full blown pilates exercise class with a group of people. If you do it 3 times a week you will really start noticing a difference in your posture and how the center of your body feels. The ""challenge"" part of the dvd uses a stretchy/resistance band. Don't let that scare you, it's actually awesome and you'll feel it so much in your legs! (leg circles with the resistance band) It feels really good. You can buy the stretchie through amazon or Leslie's website, but you can also just use a regular resistance band and it does the same thing. You do not need the resistance band to do the exercises on this dvd. You also do not have to be able to complete all of the exercises as many times as she goes through them. You will still feel the benefits by simply trying the moves and doing the best you can. I really noticed a difference after doing the dvd ten times.",1369440000,3,1659,4.3896103896103895

1991046,4,B0001DHSCO,"I began this DVD to kick start Pilates. It's a good start with very simple introductions into each position. I had never done Pilates (seriously) before, so I didn't feel too intimidated or balk at any of the positions. I also noticed I feel a lot less stress in my shoulders when I use the videos.",1367193600,3,298,4.339285714285714
1991047,4,B0001DHSCO,"Enjoyed Leslie's patiently explaining each step and not rushing through the exercises.

1991090,5,B0001DHSCO,All her video's that I have bought are so user friendly. I have her 4 mile walking video & love it. She explains  what she is doing in common sense terms. I'm not sure if Leslie has a Yoga video I need to check that out! I love being home in the privacy of my house I know that is part of why I enjoy it!,1363651200,,304,3.606060606060606

1991097,4,B0001DHSCO,"I have avoided Pilates for a long time.  My abs and neck are very weak.  I have Leslie Sansone's video for Abs and like it, so I thought I'd try this one.  Yes, it is a super basic pilates video, but I do like it.  For someone who NEVER does pilates, but wants to try it, this is a good place to start.  I know anyone who feels comfortable already with pilates probably won't like this video and will think it a verson for wimpy people, like me.  But, I still like it.  So, if you're looking for a simple abs workout, this will do the trick.  I like Leslie's workouts because I get a good workout without putting strain on my knees or neck.  I do get a good workout.  But, I am averse to pain.  So, if you think that describes you at all, too, then I'd try this video.  If you are in great shape with a strong neck and abs, I'd look for another pilates video instead of this one.",1337385600,13,879,3.9885057471264367

Nevertheless, I haven't done Pilates in a very long time and my core was weak. If you've never done Pilates or are trying to get back into it, this is the DVD for you. I've been doing it for a week and already feel those muscles coming back. This DVD is definitely not for those that need intermediate Pilates, but it's a really good place to start.",1317254400,6,449,4.172413793103448

1991121,5,B0001DHSCO,"My first introduction to Pilates was a short (10 minute) segment on one of Leslie's 3 mile walks.  I ordered this DVD so that I would have a longer Pilates workout option.  I found most of the stretches and postures doable but with varying degrees of challenge during the basic mat routine.  Sound introduction to Pilates principles and I could definitely feel the core muscle firing up.  Haven't yet tried the challenge workout included on this DVD: waiting to see if I am sore in the morning (did it for the first time today).

1991122,5,B0001DHSCO,"I had this pilates workout on vhs and wore it out so am glad to have it on dvd now.  This is a totally doable workout for the everyday person.  Leslie Sansone makes you feel like she's just a regular person also and lets you know you don't have to be perfect at working out.
The instructions are clear and easy to follow.  It will be nice to be able to skip right to the workout part and past the demonstration at the beginning unlike when using the vhs tape.
I recommend this dvd and am a faithful Leslie Sansone follower and have been for over 20 years now.",1295308800,3,559,4.110091743119266

We wanted to have some extra stretching and toning at the end of our exercise routine. This was EXCELLENT! It is simple enough that beginners can join right in and not be confused. However, as with all Leslie's videos, you can make it as advanced as you want too. I am very pleased with this video. It is safe, effective and enjoyable. Also she is educational about Pilates, but there isn't any additional spiritual weirdness as you might find with doing a Yoga video.",1288569600,2,563,4.475728155339806
1991124,5,B0001DHSCO,"Well written, produced, excellant instruction.

Leslie's instructions are easy on the ears, no hyper-active ""You can do it!"" She uses a regular tone of voice instead of trying to ""sooth"" you into it like Denise Austin.

The music is a bit cheesy but understated enough not to be annoying.

The exercises are accessible (I'm 42 and in decent shape) except for the roll up. I've never been able to do that!

I like that she uses the yoga terms minimally and keeps it strictly as exercise.",1281484800,2,486,4.616279069767442

1991126,5,B0001DHSCO,I have been a huge fan of Leslie Sansone's Walk DVDs for over a year and needed a veriety in my workout routine. I really enjoy this DVD. My joints are sensitive and doing the Pilates sessions at the gym have been to extreme. Leslie's You Can Do Pilates is gentle yet very efficient and fun. I especially enjoy the band Pilates work out session where the moves are enhances with the resistance band. The pace is slower and the movements are more basic so I can do the exercises at my own pace and not loose form. I feel really relieved that I do not have to do extreme workouts to get and stay fit. Leslie's You can Do Pilates gets my whole body trimmed and flexible.,1270512000,5,667,4.21875

I really wasn't into Pilates, but I do like this video.

The whole body is involed in the-not just your core. I purchased this and Pilates for Dummies.  I feel like I work much harder and got better results with Leslie Sansone.  The Dummies video didn't work the whole body as well as this.  I wish Leslie would expand this to a series and make more.  I would definetly buy them!,1169164800,5,461,4.241379310344827
1991184,4,B0001DHSCO,"This is what you would expect from Leslie Sansone.  It is simple without being patronizing.  I tend to imagine that she is teaching a bunch of old ladies at a retirement home when she presents stuff, so she is down to earth and simple in her presentation without sounding like an airhead (there is no talk of melting the butter off our bodies).  It's excellent for stretching and abs and general core toning.  Yes, it could be more challenging but I still get a good workout (and I don't see myself as her target audience.  I'm sure the ladies at the retirement home aren't complaining.)",1168473600,8,587,4.552380952380952
1991185,5,B0001DHSCO,"Leslie has created a very easy and straight forward Pilates series (one floor toning that is over 15 minutes and one 10 minute toning segment).  She starts off teaching you the basics (verbally) talking about the techniques and terms about each movement so it's easier to visualise when you're doing them.  You then do those movements in the first workout and then in the second workout, it becomes a little more advanced because you use resistance bands and many muscles at a time.  I find her to be encouraging and motivating and talks you through each move in a friendly way and I like that.  The only thing you need is a resistance band, and you will tone muscles you never knew you had.  It's a great workout that I enjoy doing.",1156896000,15,733,4.5227272727272725
1991186,5,B0001DHSCO,"After seeing all the Pilates infomercials on TV I thought I'd give it a try. As I searched Amazon for a place to start I came across Leslie's DVD.  I have one of her Walk Away the Pounds workouts and really enjoy it so I thought I'd give this one a try too.

I am thuroughly enjoying it. Leslie takes the time to explain the basic moves and the history behind Pilates in a great intro.  After working along with the intro a couple of times I moved on to the Mat Workout. I had abdominal surgery about 4 months earlier and was concerned about the strain on the muscles and ""engaging my core"" but found that the alternatives allowed me to work through everything with minimal discomfort. Before long I was working right along with her and even trying some of the more challenging versions. I have not yet attempted the Mat Challenge because I do not have resistance bands but plan to purchase them soon.

I would recommend this workout for anyone that is looking to start (or restarting like I was)an exercise regime.",1154476800,20,1015,4.440860215053763
1991187,5,B0001DHSCO,"Having never done pilates or yoga before I tried this product with great trepidation.  I love Leslie's walking videos but even after 4 and 5 miles a day found myself wanting more.  I alternate these videos every other day and do them after my cardio 4 or 5 mile walk.  After the first day of pilates I felt a difference.  I walk taller, carry myself stronger, and notice a definite improvement in my abs (which is a miracle in and of itself since I detest sit ups and other types of ab work).  These are amazing...a  must have.",1151452800,5,527,4.326530612244898

Once again, she teaches you the moves you need and puts them together to create a great workout. I was shocked that I finished the first workout. I felt relaxed and taller! I am not yet ready to tackle the challenge, but I highly recommend this for anyone who has always wanted to try pilates, but was afraid to do so.",1142899200,23,493,4.311827956989247

I am recovering from a herniated disc and I have found this workout to be just the right combo of intensity, instruction, and results. If you can do basic yoga or are looking to add to your pilates collection, this video will be a waste of your time...you have probably covered everything Leslie teaches already.

Both are wonderful.  I felt like the Yoga gave me a good stretch workout while this pilates DVD gave me a little more of an aerobic and muscular workout.

The DVD has 3 sections:

1. Moves and Techniques - approx 17 min - lays out the details on how to do the moves that she'll be using in the workout.  These are the most common pilates moves.

2. The Mat workout - approx 17 min - goes through the whole workout; for such a short time span, you get a lot done!

3. The Mat Challenge - I still didn't get to this section yet because you need one of those stretchy resistance bands.",1126310400,38,752,4.068027210884353
1991232,5,B0001DHSCO,"I sit at a desk all day long every day.  When I'm not at the desk, I'm on the couch.  I CAN'T EXERCISE!  I wasn't any good at PE and I hate aerobics.  But I CAN DO Pilates with this DVD and it feels GREAT!

I couldn't ""Peel myself off of the floor"" the first few times... (I had to cheat) but by the 5th workout I was doing it w/o a problem.  I couldn't always extend my leg fully (I cheated) but by the fifth workout I was doing it!

Don't give up.  With a lil tiny bit of ""hey I don't care if I cheat as long as I am trying"" and a whole lot of ""WOW THIS ACTUALLY FEELS GOOD"" you'll be amazed at the results.

I am now ANXIOUS to excerise each and every day.  I actually look forward to it.  It's WEIRD!

I love her calm adult voice...not that squeaky beeboppy I'm a barbie on steriods hear-me-squeal junk.  Leslie is enjoyable to work with from beginning to end.

From someone who would never recommend an excercise video...I must say...this is a must have!",1123804800,102,959,4.031914893617022
1991233,5,B0001DHSCO,"I am a fairly active person, but when I first tried this a few  weeks ago, I couldn't stay ""engaged"" for ANY amount of time! Thought I had wasted my money!! I have several other Leslie videos, and I decided I'd give this one more try before sending it to the eBay pile. The second time, I found I could stay engaged longer. The moves weren't as challenging (read: nearly impossible to do!), and when I was done, I actually felt pretty good. Now I'm doing it three times weekly, as she recommends. It is still challenging~but in a good way~and in just that short amount of time, I can feel the strengthening in my core, and especially in my neck. I'm also noticing more definition in my legs. Don't give up if it seems too difficult at first. Even if you have to do the exercises lying down, instead of with ""powerhouse engaged"", you're still getting a good workout. Eventually, you'll get there. I always feel very refreshed and relaxed after this.",1113177600,36,948,4.479768786127168
1991234,5,B0001DHSCO,"If you cannot do sit ups, if you do not have a strong core, or abdomen, if you have back problems, if you have not exercised recently or if you do not exercise weekly, please do not waste your money on this dvd.  I recently bought this dvd and I could not do it. It was torturous, painful, impossible.  All the exercises involve your core, your abdomen.  It is like doing difficult sit ups for a half hour. I think that if you are out of shape, you should try to do the You Can Do Yoga Dvd and then, after you gain flexibility and strength, you can get the pilates dvd and try again. Maybe one day I will be able to do the pilates, but for now I will stick to the yoga dvd.  I hope this helps.  Otherwise, Leslie Sansone is great in this dvd, like she always is and I do recommend this dvd to people who have a strong core.",1107648000,66,823,3.963636363636364
1991235,5,B0001DHSCO,"I have been using the ""You Can Do Pilates"" video for two weeks now.  I have tried mat pilates before and was not strong enough to do many of the movements, so I gave up.  This video is very accessible and reasonably paced, but the moves definitely build strength.  Leslie filmed three workouts; the first one short and instructional, and the next two increasing in difficulty and length.  You start with the instructional, and move up to the others when you are strong enough.  I already feel much stronger after doing Level 2 a few times, and would recommend the video to anyone who is curious about Pilates, unless they are already extremely fit (gymnast, etc).

If you are very strong and fit, including your abdominal and lower back muscles, you may prefer a more advanced video with another teacher, but if you are discouraged by its difficulty, try Sansone's You Can Do Pilates.  I hope this DVD is available for years, because it's a great workout that works.",1103414400,99,966,4.680473372781065

1991237,5,B0001DHSCO,"In this 60 Minute DVD, you will find a complete workout with additional instruction. The first section can be viewed without working out or you can follow along and try out the new exercises.

 I was impressed with Leslie Sansone's professional approach to Pilates. I had just finished her 3-mile walk and was thinking about finishing my workout routine with a Pilates DVD. Fortunately, Leslie spends time explaining each exercise so I had a bit of time to cool down. However, once I started the actual workout, it was definitely filled with calorie burning exercises.

 While she focuses on ""just the basics"" you really do get a great workout. You start with ""the hundred"" and progress to the roll-up, leg circles and simple leg stretch. The last exercise is the ""plank"" which could have flowed into some push-ups, but trying to hold your body in the plank position for even 10 seconds can be a good challenge depending on your fitness level.

 If you are new to Pilates, this might be one of the best ways to get started besides the Winsor Pilates workouts. If you have been doing Pilates for a few years, this might work as a quick refresher course and the swimming exercise in this DVD is pretty powerful.

 I actually think Leslie should make more workouts like this one because she really excels at the professional approach. A lot of her walk videos are on the extremely joyful side and to actually watch her teaching in such a serene style made me more aware of all the beauty she has to offer the world. I've lost 11  inches since starting her Walk Workouts and I can say that I had struggled to lose inches before starting her walking program. So, I'm very pleased she is branching out to new areas and hope she continues to make highly professional workouts and I hope she does a few more walk workouts because I need MORE!

 To make this workout super efficient, try one of Leslie's walking workouts and you will find that you really do need that couch after all. :) I love it when I can complete two workout videos/DVDs and I can feel that I accomplished a great deal in under two hours. Thank you LESLIE!
