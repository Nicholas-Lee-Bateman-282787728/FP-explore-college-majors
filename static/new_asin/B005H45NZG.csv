Liquor is the root of evil says the housekeeper. Sen Toy screams, she found Lois body! The Press Agent suggests taking the body outdoors and call it a drowning. But Lois was garroted with a silken cord. Sen Toy will call Jimmy Chana, a great detective. Birmingham Brown answers the telephone; he will drive Charlie Chan to that address. Jimmy finds the address on a notepad.

The police arrive to begin the investigation. Charlie arrives and talks to Sergeant Reynolds of the State Police. The men search for Marcia. Rick Davis, the Press Agent, greets Charlie. Next Cole King and George Brant (the Physical Therapist). The girls upstairs see a man on their porch looking into a window. It is Jimmy Chan, who is investigating on his own. Jimmy and Birmingham will guard the house. This leads to comic scenes in a dark cellar. A man with a bundle escapes. Upstairs a young woman screams. There is a smell of ether! Charlie recreates the murder. The killer was a friend, says Charlie. While playing on the beach one girl finds a body covered with seaweed. She was garroted too. Was it a suicide? Charlie watches a man with a bundle.

The man explains his action with Marcias robe. Rick offers his explanations. Charlie tells everyone not to leave the house. Somebody drives a car away, Sergeant Reynolds rides after it and stops it on the highway. Charlie talks to the doctor about his past. The doctor tells Charlie what he did. But the metal box with letters is missing! Jimmy and Birmingham are asked to search for that missing box. Sergeant Reynolds searches a room. So does Jimmy until someone hits him with a club! One girl screams, she heard something in the wall. A sliding door is a relic from Prohibition days. Charlie tells the Sergeant to keep guard at night so no one goes from the cabaa to the house. The Maestro is very nervous, and tells about that box. Jimmy finds a secret panel and explores it. He calls for help from Birmingham. Someone drives away from the house. There is a car chase in the night then a car crash. The driver tells what happened in the past and what was done. Charlie explains the events.

This movie has the limited scenery of a lower budget movie, using a beach house instead of a ship. It seems more complex that previous stories. Was the solution plausible to you? Overall its a good story as long as you accept its premises. It tells about the styles and attitudes of that era. This was Sidney Tolers last movie, he died afterwards so a new actor continued the series.",1486684800,,2897,4.608527131782946
