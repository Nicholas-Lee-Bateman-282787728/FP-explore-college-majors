8121785,5,B000FFJYI4,So far this is the last of the series released officialy. (although you can find bootlegs of the rest of the series on dvd on ebay but not as great pic/aud quality as official) After enjoying the last two vampire high dvds i loved this one just the same. When it was over I was begging for more to be released. It was so great and i couldn't stand not seeing the rest of the show. It only aired/aires in canada and the UK. luckily a friend of mine was doing a summer internship in the UK and he recorded the rest of the show for me. Hopefully the entire show will come out so all it's fans can see. so buy these with the other dvds and you won't regret it. It lasted only one season but it wasn't enough for me or it's other fans around he world.,1227312000,2,746,3.98
