8685701,5,B00OZ4OWV0,"InSpectres is great indie film with lots of good humor and plot twists. If your a fan of spooks, everyday heroes and humor then InSpectres is the paranormal flick for you. I had the chance to enjoy it on the big screen and I'm stoked I'm able to get a copy on blu ray. Good pick for Friday night movie night. Oh and who doesn't love a paranormal toaster!?!?!",1414540800,2,358,4.202898550724638
