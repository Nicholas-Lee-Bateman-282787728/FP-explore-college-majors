8132618,5,B000GI430E,"This is quite simply one of the best war films I have seen in years.  In the description I give, there is nothing beyond the ad blurb. I reveal no spoilers.

The point of view is that of a young nurse, an orphan of extraordinary beauty.  In spite of being gang raped by her patients at the moment she started out on the front in China, she clings to her humanity and capacity to empathize and love.  She puts everything she has to offer out there - her work, her caring, even her body when the needs of others come into consideration.  Everyone sees it as natural, there is no moral condemnation of her behavior, though few offer any sympathy to what she is experiencing.  In accordance with Japanese tradition, she submits to it all without complaint, though somehow her heart remains open.

In terms of plot, she meets a physician whom she begins to love.  He is a broken man, a morphine addict, and she helps him to look beyond the horror as he makes life and death decisions every few minutes.  As the tactical war turns against the Japanese, she is serene in that they have had some moments of love.  It is very moving.

This is a brilliant and raw portrayal of complete horror.  It is not for the squeamish, but shows it like it was.  Recommended for those with strong stomachs.",1455840000,3,1284,4.412765957446808

8132620,5,B000GI430E,"This is only the third Masumura film I've seen, but unlike the others (Blind Beast and Black Test Car) Red Angel kept me awake pondering its message. Not exactly an anti-war film, nor one championing women's rights (though both themes are apparent), this masterpiece, it suddenly occurred to me in the middle of the night, was far more profound than I had first thought. The key is the army doctor's addiction to morphine, and Nurse Nishi's determination to stop it. I won't spoil anything, but suffice to say that this film opened my eyes to this underrated Japanese director. Quite unlike Ozu, Mizoguchi, and Kurosawa, Masumura distances his audience from the story. The countless amputated hands and feet sticking awkwardly out of buckets in the middle of a makeshift army hospital are not too hard to stomach! With less emotional attachment, what comes through is the story, the symbols, the awakening. Ayako Wakao, whom you might have seen in Mizoguchi's Street of Shame or Ozu's Floating Weeds, IS Nurse Nishi Cherry Blossom: modest, compassionate, dignified. When she puts on the doctor's uniform and boots, it suddenly takes you aback. And in the final, haunting scene (not unlike that of Kobayashi's The Human Condition) you come to understand what angel she really is. Surely an inspiration for Wakamatsu's Caterpillar, Red Angel begs multiple viewings.",1359331200,4,1363,5.116591928251121
8132621,5,B000GI430E,"Soldiers are not the only ones who go to war.  Mobilized along with the battalions of infantry, artillery and commanding officers are supporting squads of medics, surgeons and nurses.  They are the ones who attempt to repair the damage done by enemy forces, to stitch the fighters back up so they can either be sent home as useless or sent back into the breech to kill or be killed. They too can become casualties of the conflict.

""Red Angel"" (""Akai Tenshi"") is the story of one of these nurses, a young and pretty woman named Nishi Sakura (Wakao Ayako) who is sent to support the war in China in 1939, one of the most horrible times in the 15-year long Pacific War.  In the film, little is told of Nishi's backstory.  Did she volunteer?  Was she drafted?  Was she a virgin?  For us, her life begins the first night of her first shift as an army nurse, where she is brutally raped by one of the recuperating soldiers while the rest of the ward room watches, appreciative of the ""entertainment"".  It is a harsh lesson for both Nishi as well as the viewers.  This is not going to be a story about heroes.

Recovering from this initial horror, Nishi is only thrown deeper into the reality of working with men who have been reduced to beasts, who know that they will die soon enough so what does it matter what they do in the meantime.  Trying desperately to retain her humanity, she tries to stitch the wounds and relieve the pain as best she can, pulling out hundreds of bullets in a single day and unable to wash the sent of blood from her hands.  Into her life comes Dr. Okabe (Ashida Shinsuke), and older man who reminds her of her father.  Okabe has lost his struggle, giving up his skills as a doctor and simply becoming a hacker at a butcher's shop, cutting off arms and legs whether they need it or not, simply because it is the easiest thing to do.  A morphine addict, Okabe steals supplies to feed his habit, an addiction that has rendered him sexually impotent, and thus a perfect match for Nishi to fall in love with.

Director Masumura Yasuzo is not one of the most famous Japanese directors.  He does not have the reputation of Kurosawa or Ozu, or even Gosha or Kobayashi.  While not a genius or innovator,  he is a skilled craftsman who can bring to life difficult scripts with inspired imagery.  He often works with uncomfortable sexual situations, such as in his films&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blind-Beast/dp/B0001A79C6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blind Beast</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Manji/dp/B0001XAKR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Manji</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Afraid-to-Die/dp/B0001XAKQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Afraid to Die</a>.  There is often a brutality associated with sex, and Red Angel is no exception.  However, what is different here is the tenderness allowed between Okabe and Nishi, where Okabe's impotence allows him to be a non-aggressor.  He still takes pleasure in pretty women, but pursues things no further than his condition allows him.  Nishi, on the other hand, is desperate for sex coupled with affection, as opposed to the sex/death connection that has been her experienced up till now.

Aside from the sexual aspect of ""Red Angel"", the realities of a war-time surgical tent are shown in bold strokes.  Limbs are cut off and carried away like an assembly line, and human beings are just so much meat.  What Masumura could not do with color, this being a black and white film, he did with sound, with saws grinding bone and flesh producing more horror than any slasher flick.  Soldiers come and go, one minute breathing and talking, the next minute a face in a body bag.  But the doctors and nurses just keep on working through the gore, stitching up what they can, deciding who will live or who will die with nothing more than a few seconds triage.

I am really glad that Fantoma has brought so many of Masumura's films to DVD for Western audiences.  He is an often overlooked director, although all of his flicks are worth watching.  ""Red Angel"" is among his very best.",1221004800,10,4175,5.058479532163743
