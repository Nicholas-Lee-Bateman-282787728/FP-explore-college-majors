3146061,1,B0015NORDM,"How can a studio have such a wonderful product to build upon, and screw it up so badly?  The original War Games was filled with wonderful, sympathetic HUMAN characters, funny moments amid the rising drama, and a wonderful sense of pace and build.  The Dead Code has NONE of this, substituting MTV-like editing, suspense-free drama, and amoral characters who you want to slap from the first moment.  How to count the wrongs?  The ""Bimbo Bomb"" at the very beginning?  The completely inept chase scene where speeding cars CANNOT catch up with the on-foot suspects?  The mother character who is introduced, and then dropped like a lead brick?  The final scene which does nothing more than copy the original message?  The non-existent chemistry between the two leads?  The only good parts of this film are when they bring back elements from the original film, but those pleasures are few and far between.  This one is awful from the word go.  Watch the original instead.",1218153600,57,965,4.858895705521473
3146062,3,B0015NORDM,"This is a pretty solid movie both well written and entertaining.
In other words i did not fall asleep watching it and pressed paused while
i made a snack.....pressed paused cause i didn't want to miss anything
important to the story line...in which case points to a good movie.
  There was only one scene which didn't impress me much...kinda looked
fake....its the running away scene by foot.....They ran and ran and never
ran out of breath...and the cars following them looked too slow or something....
I do recommend this movie...and probably worth keeping for future views.",1217980800,4,576,4.989583333333333

3146064,2,B0015NORDM,"One star would be too low as it had two redeeming moments, but I'm comfy with two stars. A straight to DVD film - it's obvious why it made no sense to release it to theatres. They tried to take the original film, and update the politics and technology, but didn't pull it off. A couple good ideas in the script, and a couple of good moments, but they're outnumbered by a hundred bad ideas. The ending stole too much from the original. If you loved the original then just keep your expectations low and you'll have a good time. If you're on any kind of budget, the only winning move is not to press play.

3146065,5,B0015NORDM,"I might have liked this movie because I went into it with really low expectations, but I really think that this was a very well done Direct-to-DVD sequel.

Sure, the plot was very close to the original movie, there were places where the dialoge was even groan worthy, but it wasn't enough to bog me down to the point where I couldn't enjoy the movie. The one aspect of the movie that surprised me was the CGI and action sequences. I was expecting something along the lines of 'A Sound of Thunder', but what was presented was much closer to what I've seen on shows like Lost and 24.

There isn't alot to connect the cult film of the 80's with this film until the last half of the film when you find out a nice plot point that allow for a nice cameo from Dr. Falkner and Joshua.

The reviews I've read on other sites seem to focus too much on how similar in plot this movie is to the original, or that none of the original actors return to reprise their roles. I didn't really see a need to include original actors except for the role of Dr. Falkner, and the original actor John Wood had retired from acting long before this movie was even though about. I thought Gary Reineke did a very passable Dr. Falkner in this sequel, and when you hear Joshua ask ""Shall we play a game?"" again you can't help but smile.

As for the plot, I did see the similarities, but also saw its divergences. It felt like the plot was equal parts War Games, The Bourne Identity, and Hackers. It is a Direct-to-DVD movie so I wasn't expecting alot of originality, but there was definately a good mix to keep me interested.

While this movie bears all the marks of being a lesser sequel, it stands out as one of the better direct-to-DVD movies I've seen.",1217548800,4,1727,4.3015384615384615

3146067,4,B0015NORDM,"This is more a modernized remake than a true sequel to WarGames.  But, the writers/producers very smartly, though loosely, tied it into the classic original in order to get a wider audience than a random computer hacker movie called The Dead Code would get alone.

3146070,3,B0015NORDM,"Wow, has this 2008 remake of 1983's terrific film classic, which had had Matthew Broderick as its lead male role, ever encountered severe reviews from movie fans here and there on the Web! I would be the first one, as a big fan of Broderick's early work, to admit that the 1983 film is unbeatable. However, the 2008 remake with Matt Lantner and Amanda Walsh as the two fugitive young lovers, for all of that, makes for an pleasurable night's entertainment in front of the video screen, despite the gaffs that the movie displays here and there regarding the computer, drone aeronautic, and other technologies that ""War Games"" (2008) depicts.

If one's interest in this movie is, foremost, technology that it shows in action, then, of course, one is likely to be less favourable to this remake of ""War Games"", due to it falling afoul of technical details involved in the action. On the other hand, if interest centres on the young people in this film, i.e., on Will, Annie, and Dennis, upon their plight, and on the adults who variously help and hinder them, then one's reaction is likely to be to find the film more enjoyable than that. Anyway, the 2008 work is a made-for-video film and it  looks it, too, not having the visual sweep of a film released to show in theatres and, later, to view with all that more pleasure as a fine DVD product. Still, it has its good elements.

For starters, the two kids on the lamm are very appealing, projecting late adolescence more than the more innocent mid-teenage image of Matthew Broderick (who looked several years younger than the 21 years of age he turned in 1983) and his male and female pals. I like the sweetness of those younger kids, but, let's face it, Matt Lanter is a real ""studmuffin"" and has a lot more sex appeal to project than Broderick does, and Lanter could have passed, at the youngest, for a 19- or 20-years-old in 2008 (although he turned 25 that year). Amanda Walsh is not quite in his league, but she more than holds her own with Lanter. That creates quite a different dynamic in the 2008 remake. And, shucks, those chase scenes of Lanter and Walsh dodging dangers as the authorities surveil and pursue them through the streets, some structures, and urban subterranean underbelly of Montral, especially in the old part of the city so popular with tourists who visit that great metropolis, are great fun to see for anyone who knows the city. (I lived there for twenty years, and love that aspect of the remake!)

Anyway, by all means see, over and over, the 1983 film with the ever-effervescent and wily Matthew Broderick, but enjoy this 2008 remake at least once, for what it is worth and for the sake of the mostly good (some very good-looking, too!) cast that enacts it.",1444521600,,2737,4.625514403292181

3146074,4,B0015NORDM,"Devoted fans of the first WarGames movie may be disappointed by this supposed sequel. The production values are much lower and while the filmmakers include a few nostalgic nods to the 1980s, unfortunately the storyline and performances don't quite come together. But the good news is -- for a low-budget rehash, this Canadian-made adventure film gets in a surprising number of big ideas. The terrorism gambling site seems to be based on a real proposal, the Policy Analysis Market developed by DARPA in the US. Also this is one of the first movies that featured military drones as a major part of the plot, and it even considers some of the ethical ramifications of using them in the field. The operator Newman -- a young technician who unlike the men in the WarGames missile silos is probably civilian -- sees the impacts of a drone strike halfway across the planet. The filmmakers don't go so far as some recent movies to speculate on how this affects his state of mind, but it's an indication that today's technology has changed warfare almost as much as the introduction of strategic nuclear weapons did.

This is only a background point, since the film quickly shifts focus to a group of teenaged students and their online antics. The kids don't realize that the computer game they're playing is a US government project designed to track down potential terrorists, and the protagonist Will Farmer inadvertently gets his innocent Muslim neighbor into trouble with Homeland Security. Pretty soon Will himself is on the run, trying to prevent the artificial intelligence RIPLEY that controls the game from overreacting and destroying Philadelphia.

As preposterous as some of the plot developments are (even more so than the original movie), the director generally moves the action along quickly enough that the shortcomings aren't too glaring. One thing that really comes across well is the passage of time. Some of the actors were infants when WarGames was released, and it shows. In the quarter-century since WarGames was released, the Cold War seems almost quaint and idealistic -- and as obsolete as the dusty WOPR computer that resurfaces in northern Canada. Whether by accident or design, this follow-up film does convey the murkiness and confusion of the present day. Geopolitical turmoil, fears of terrorist attacks, and the rise of the surveillance state all make things a lot less clear than the looming threat of global nuclear annihilation that reached a peak in the 1980s.

I'm giving the film four stars for its big-picture view, though really it's borderline since the needlessly-complicated plot and repetitive structure hamper the storytelling. It's understandable that budget and technical constraints would have restricted what they could put onscreen, but they did have some competent actors -- and the writing and direction should have made better use of them.",1433203200,,2884,5.118895966029724

Frankly, I think those that panned this movie harshly are either still in love with anything 80s or have not seen the original movie in a long time. W.G. 2 follows the fist movie just enough but is not a total rehash of the original. It's a pretty good movie for a direct to DVD release actually. Characters and actors are solid. The plot has no glaring holes. No one is thrown into the mix just to add color or distraction as some lower budgets movies are known to do. The main characters do a good job as does the supporting group. The plot is interesting and while similar to the original it is certainly modernized. The premise being that after the near disaster the first time, the Gov and scientists just couldn't ""let sleeping dogs lie."" An idea which is all too real today.

This movie is riddled with plot holes so big you can drive a truck through it:  It went off the mark because they tried to make it into more of a thriller/horror movie rather than Sci-Fi, and as a result, it has all the technical accuracy of a horror movie with lightning striking the ground and magically traveling up away from the ground to strike somebody on top of a two story building.  Yeah, it's really that insanely wrong.  Here's a partial list of the more egregious mistakes:

* A guy diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer is running around keeping up with a bunch of kids.

* A predator drone manages to fly from LA to Philadelphia by way of Canada, then continues to D.C.  Actual range of a predator drone from L.A.: about as far as Albuquerque, NM.  In the real world, it would have to land for refueling three times even if it made a direct flight to D.C. without flying through Canada.

* This missile had the ability to take out the entire population of Washington D.C.  In reality, even with a Reaper, you get four missiles and two laser-guided bombs.  In the best case, you'd only blow six craters that are a few hundred feet across.  You might get lucky and kill a single-digit percentage of D.C.  Not even close to 100%.  That's just laughable.  Even with six daisy cutter bombs (each of which weighs twice the total weight capacity of a predator drone), you'd only destroy a little over two square miles, or barely 5% of the area of Washington D.C., not counting nearby structural damage due to the pressure wave.  The very idea that a single predator drone with a nonnuclear payload could wipe out Washington D.C. is preposterous.

* Do you honestly expect me to believe that the military would design a predator drone without a kill switch?

* Or that the military couldn't scramble a jet to shoot it down in the entire DAY it would take a predator to fly such a route at maximum speed (135 MPH)?

* Or that the U.S. military would design a system in which the destruction of Washington, D.C. would trigger a dead man's switch that nukes the planet, despite no damage to NORAD or to Air Force One, where those missiles are actually controlled?

* The computer system is in a room full of carbon dioxide.  People repair it how?

* The computer system looks like it is some gamer PC blown up to room size.

* The military somehow manages to have real-time access to hundreds of security cameras in a foreign country, yet cannot figure out how to shut off a computer in the next room.

* The Canadian police can't figure out how to head someone off when they are on foot.

* Falken has to empty his gas can into his tank just to reach the power plant.  How was he planning to get back?

* Why is the Canadian power plant run by a former Cosmonaut?  That just seems entirely arbitrary and bizarre.

* And seriously?  The U.S. government has resorted to blackmailing people for information now?

* And rather than apprehend the kid at the airport, they apprehended his friend because they thought somebody associated with a terrorist cell who was traveling on a school field trip would somehow lead them to other members of the cell despite having no history of communicating with Canadians?

* And they knowingly let a presumed dangerous person on board and did not recall the plane because?

* And in spite of the fact that the only person he led them to was the girl he flew with, they suddenly decided to move in and capture him anyway?

* And what kind of stalker geek memorizes the model of a girl's cell phone so that he can have an appropriate data cable with him just in case he has to borrow her phone to use as a network connection?

* And why did they do that when he enabled a wireless connection on the computer he was connecting to just a few seconds previous to this?

* And how can you track the location of a cell phone that is down inside a subway tunnel?  Unless there are cells in the subway tunnel, you probably won't even get a ping response, much less be able to triangulate in any useful fashion.

And so on.  This movie is so bad it hurts.

The most egregious mistake in the first WarGames movie (apart from the suspension of disbelief about the premise of a computer that could learn well enough to do what it did) was that an acoustic coupler modem can't typically hang up the phone, which means it generally can't be used as an autodialer.  And I'm not quite clear why shorting the microphone would get you a dial tone on a pay phone.  (There were ways to do it back then, but I'm not aware of that being one of them.)  Both of those details are so far beyond what the average person would know, though, that I can overlook them.  This sequel, by contrast was like watching a train wreck in slow motion.  Every time you turned around, there was something else glaringly wrong.  Why can't Hollywood writers at least hire just one person knowledgeable about technology before putting out a screenplay?  These are just the flaws that were obvious off the top of my head at the end of the movie without me actively looking for flaws....  *sigh*",1289260800,31,5179,4.441145281018027

I did notice by the end of the movie that it share a little similarity with the movie Eagle Eye I did not let that get in the way of my enjoyment of the film. I think this film help up well on its own merits.

For one I wasn't bored. I was kept interested throughout the whole movie watching what Ripley would do next. The opening scene for instance with the terrorists was quite good. That scene alone got my attention. The rest of the movie then followed.

it was nice to see things from the original Wargames in this like the WOPR computer and Dr. Falken so that kept my interest too.

It is presented as a sequel to the original 1983 WarGames in that it builds upon events which transpired in the original film.  It comes across as a remake in that Dead Code essentially warms over the plot of the original substituting modern elements into the same storyline with an identical ending.

The many subtle references to the original film are commendable.  Making a sequel with essentially the same plot and ending as the original is not.  Dead Code is hardly a worthy successor to the classic original.",1272412800,2,641,4.587719298245614

3146109,2,B0015NORDM,"I have mixed feelngs about this movie, or at least what they aired on TV.  I liked that R.I.P.L.E.Y. (whose acronym is never explained, to my knowledge) is tied in as an extension of the W.O.P.R. and that a character (or perhaps two, including Joshua) from the original classic is included for additional continuity.  I wish they could have used the same actor and even the same voice synthesizer, but those are the least of the problems with the movie.  I don't like any of the main characters who, unlike Broderick, Sheedy, Coleman, Wood, Clay, and others, are rather two-dimensional and not partcularly likeable.  Worse, they who don't learn a darn thing from their experience, and end the movie as self-absorbed and self-interested as when it began.  In the original David and later Jennifer realize for what they are fighting and the dire consequences of failure, and evince that understanding during their meeting with Falken at his Goose Island retreat.  In this sequel the two fugitives are out to save themselves through most of the movie, and arguably up through the end as well.  Even the concern the hero has for his ailing mother and the ""untold-hero"" story of his father seems tacked on rather than an integral part of the character or the plot.

I'll probably purchase this DVD when the price drops a bit more just to have both halves of the story, but won't watch it anywhere near as often as the first movie.",1253404800,3,1425,4.7408906882591095
3146110,2,B0015NORDM,"I must agree with all the people who reviewed this in the resounding negative. The trailer that was shown at the one night 25th anniversary showing of the original was probably better. This version had the feel of a TV movie and without the references to the original characters(WOPR/Joshua and Steven Falken)it probably could have stood on its own. Unfortunately there would not have been a reason to tie it in with the original and thus people would be confused....It was fast paced, almost too fast and predictble yet at the same time, it was longer than necessary. It was a great premise, but perhaps if directed(and written) in the same style of John Badham, it would (could) have been better. Maybe watching it back to back with the original would help it, if only for a bit. The end segment reference makes it unable to stand on its own as without the reference to the end of the original, the entire point of the movie is lost.  Unfortunately, not well written, it's almost as if someone took the original screenplay, changed a few scenes, added a few (non-caring or useless)characters and then hit print and then someone greenlighted it.......I won't even comment on the B and C list actors an their acting ability, or perhaps it is the director's fault. In any case, if you are a fan of the original, I won't insult your intelligence by saying you will or won't like it. I can't assume that you will or won't.

3146115,1,B0015NORDM,"I'm a big fan of the original WarGames, so I took a chance on this movie based on the good reviews I saw here.  Now that I've seen it, I wish I had back its 100-minute run time, not to mention its overvalued release-date sticker price.  From start to finish, it had the feel of something written by an amateur who has no real knowledge of the world being sketched - whether it be computers, gamers, hackers, business, law enforcement, or government.  Things just happened in the movie, or became close calls, without any real reason or way of getting there.  The explanations that were eventually offered for how the characters knew what they knew had potential but were ultimately ridiculous and fell short of filling the holes or making much of the technical stuff plausible.  There isn't a drop of ""real life"" in this movie, whether it be humor, believability, or a context in which drama can unfold.

Even the action lacked any coherence.  This was especially clear during the Montreal chase, when the protagonists outran cars on foot and it was not at all clear who was involved or why.  It seems to me that not enough thought was put into how this might unfold in an analogous real-life situation.

The pattern followed for the plot was formulaic and not well developed: a paranoid and dystopic vision of society where the antagonists have unlimited power and reach and the protagonists are nobodys who are largely immoral (almost sociopathic) and seem to be able to whip up something out of nothing over and over again to save the day.  A twist added is that the ""bad guys"" really don't have any power at all and ultimately look like fools with oversized egos and paychecks.  This probably most of all gives me the impression of amateur writing at a young level - or perhaps a dumbing-down vector.  Contrast this with the final act of the original WarGames:  the antagonists get in over their heads, but they remain believable all the way through the story.  The source and scope of their power and authority is never in question, nor are their motives.  Each character in the movie is fully developed as a character, with personality and history that are not simply superfluous to the story but instead drive it.  All of the characters, from the smallest to the stars, belong and are well-integrated into the whole.  They seem like real people and we get to know them in that way.

3380562,5,B0015NORDM,"I might have liked this movie because I went into it with really low expectations, but I really think that this was a very well done Direct-to-DVD sequel.

Sure, the plot was very close to the original movie, there were places where the dialoge was even groan worthy, but it wasn't enough to bog me down to the point where I couldn't enjoy the movie. The one aspect of the movie that surprised me was the CGI and action sequences. I was expecting something along the lines of 'A Sound of Thunder', but what was presented was much closer to what I've seen on shows like Lost and 24.

There isn't alot to connect the cult film of the 80's with this film until the last half of the film when you find out a nice plot point that allow for a nice cameo from Dr. Falkner and Joshua.

The reviews I've read on other sites seem to focus too much on how similar in plot this movie is to the original, or that none of the original actors return to reprise their roles. I didn't really see a need to include original actors except for the role of Dr. Falkner, and the original actor John Wood had retired from acting long before this movie was even though about. I thought Gary Reineke did a very passable Dr. Falkner in this sequel, and when you hear Joshua ask ""Shall we play a game?"" again you can't help but smile.

As for the plot, I did see the similarities, but also saw its divergences. It felt like the plot was equal parts War Games, The Bourne Identity, and Hackers. It is a Direct-to-DVD movie so I wasn't expecting alot of originality, but there was definately a good mix to keep me interested.

3380567,3,B0015NORDM,"Wow, has this 2008 remake of 1983's terrific film classic, which had had Matthew Broderick as its lead male role, ever encountered severe reviews from movie fans here and there on the Web! I would be the first one, as a big fan of Broderick's early work, to admit that the 1983 film is unbeatable. However, the 2008 remake with Matt Lantner and Amanda Walsh as the two fugitive young lovers, for all of that, makes for an pleasurable night's entertainment in front of the video screen, despite the gaffs that the movie displays here and there regarding the computer, drone aeronautic, and other technologies that ""War Games"" (2008) depicts.

If one's interest in this movie is, foremost, technology that it shows in action, then, of course, one is likely to be less favourable to this remake of ""War Games"", due to it falling afoul of technical details involved in the action. On the other hand, if interest centres on the young people in this film, i.e., on Will, Annie, and Dennis, upon their plight, and on the adults who variously help and hinder them, then one's reaction is likely to be to find the film more enjoyable than that. Anyway, the 2008 work is a made-for-video film and it  looks it, too, not having the visual sweep of a film released to show in theatres and, later, to view with all that more pleasure as a fine DVD product. Still, it has its good elements.

For starters, the two kids on the lamm are very appealing, projecting late adolescence more than the more innocent mid-teenage image of Matthew Broderick (who looked several years younger than the 21 years of age he turned in 1983) and his male and female pals. I like the sweetness of those younger kids, but, let's face it, Matt Lanter is a real ""studmuffin"" and has a lot more sex appeal to project than Broderick does, and Lanter could have passed, at the youngest, for a 19- or 20-years-old in 2008 (although he turned 25 that year). Amanda Walsh is not quite in his league, but she more than holds her own with Lanter. That creates quite a different dynamic in the 2008 remake. And, shucks, those chase scenes of Lanter and Walsh dodging dangers as the authorities surveil and pursue them through the streets, some structures, and urban subterranean underbelly of Montral, especially in the old part of the city so popular with tourists who visit that great metropolis, are great fun to see for anyone who knows the city. (I lived there for twenty years, and love that aspect of the remake!)

Anyway, by all means see, over and over, the 1983 film with the ever-effervescent and wily Matthew Broderick, but enjoy this 2008 remake at least once, for what it is worth and for the sake of the mostly good (some very good-looking, too!) cast that enacts it.",1444521600,,2737,4.625514403292181

3380571,4,B0015NORDM,"Devoted fans of the first WarGames movie may be disappointed by this supposed sequel. The production values are much lower and while the filmmakers include a few nostalgic nods to the 1980s, unfortunately the storyline and performances don't quite come together. But the good news is -- for a low-budget rehash, this Canadian-made adventure film gets in a surprising number of big ideas. The terrorism gambling site seems to be based on a real proposal, the Policy Analysis Market developed by DARPA in the US. Also this is one of the first movies that featured military drones as a major part of the plot, and it even considers some of the ethical ramifications of using them in the field. The operator Newman -- a young technician who unlike the men in the WarGames missile silos is probably civilian -- sees the impacts of a drone strike halfway across the planet. The filmmakers don't go so far as some recent movies to speculate on how this affects his state of mind, but it's an indication that today's technology has changed warfare almost as much as the introduction of strategic nuclear weapons did.

This is only a background point, since the film quickly shifts focus to a group of teenaged students and their online antics. The kids don't realize that the computer game they're playing is a US government project designed to track down potential terrorists, and the protagonist Will Farmer inadvertently gets his innocent Muslim neighbor into trouble with Homeland Security. Pretty soon Will himself is on the run, trying to prevent the artificial intelligence RIPLEY that controls the game from overreacting and destroying Philadelphia.

As preposterous as some of the plot developments are (even more so than the original movie), the director generally moves the action along quickly enough that the shortcomings aren't too glaring. One thing that really comes across well is the passage of time. Some of the actors were infants when WarGames was released, and it shows. In the quarter-century since WarGames was released, the Cold War seems almost quaint and idealistic -- and as obsolete as the dusty WOPR computer that resurfaces in northern Canada. Whether by accident or design, this follow-up film does convey the murkiness and confusion of the present day. Geopolitical turmoil, fears of terrorist attacks, and the rise of the surveillance state all make things a lot less clear than the looming threat of global nuclear annihilation that reached a peak in the 1980s.

I'm giving the film four stars for its big-picture view, though really it's borderline since the needlessly-complicated plot and repetitive structure hamper the storytelling. It's understandable that budget and technical constraints would have restricted what they could put onscreen, but they did have some competent actors -- and the writing and direction should have made better use of them.",1433203200,,2884,5.118895966029724

I was always hoping for a more modern remake of the original Wargames and certainly this has some modern elements, but it is hard to really top the classic that was the original.

This movie is riddled with plot holes so big you can drive a truck through it:  It went off the mark because they tried to make it into more of a thriller/horror movie rather than Sci-Fi, and as a result, it has all the technical accuracy of a horror movie with lightning striking the ground and magically traveling up away from the ground to strike somebody on top of a two story building.  Yeah, it's really that insanely wrong.  Here's a partial list of the more egregious mistakes:

* A guy diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer is running around keeping up with a bunch of kids.

* A predator drone manages to fly from LA to Philadelphia by way of Canada, then continues to D.C.  Actual range of a predator drone from L.A.: about as far as Albuquerque, NM.  In the real world, it would have to land for refueling three times even if it made a direct flight to D.C. without flying through Canada.

* This missile had the ability to take out the entire population of Washington D.C.  In reality, even with a Reaper, you get four missiles and two laser-guided bombs.  In the best case, you'd only blow six craters that are a few hundred feet across.  You might get lucky and kill a single-digit percentage of D.C.  Not even close to 100%.  That's just laughable.  Even with six daisy cutter bombs (each of which weighs twice the total weight capacity of a predator drone), you'd only destroy a little over two square miles, or barely 5% of the area of Washington D.C., not counting nearby structural damage due to the pressure wave.  The very idea that a single predator drone with a nonnuclear payload could wipe out Washington D.C. is preposterous.

* Do you honestly expect me to believe that the military would design a predator drone without a kill switch?

* Or that the military couldn't scramble a jet to shoot it down in the entire DAY it would take a predator to fly such a route at maximum speed (135 MPH)?

* Or that the U.S. military would design a system in which the destruction of Washington, D.C. would trigger a dead man's switch that nukes the planet, despite no damage to NORAD or to Air Force One, where those missiles are actually controlled?

* The computer system is in a room full of carbon dioxide.  People repair it how?

* The computer system looks like it is some gamer PC blown up to room size.

* The military somehow manages to have real-time access to hundreds of security cameras in a foreign country, yet cannot figure out how to shut off a computer in the next room.

* The Canadian police can't figure out how to head someone off when they are on foot.

* Falken has to empty his gas can into his tank just to reach the power plant.  How was he planning to get back?

* Why is the Canadian power plant run by a former Cosmonaut?  That just seems entirely arbitrary and bizarre.

* And seriously?  The U.S. government has resorted to blackmailing people for information now?

* And rather than apprehend the kid at the airport, they apprehended his friend because they thought somebody associated with a terrorist cell who was traveling on a school field trip would somehow lead them to other members of the cell despite having no history of communicating with Canadians?

* And they knowingly let a presumed dangerous person on board and did not recall the plane because?

* And in spite of the fact that the only person he led them to was the girl he flew with, they suddenly decided to move in and capture him anyway?

* And what kind of stalker geek memorizes the model of a girl's cell phone so that he can have an appropriate data cable with him just in case he has to borrow her phone to use as a network connection?

* And why did they do that when he enabled a wireless connection on the computer he was connecting to just a few seconds previous to this?

* And how can you track the location of a cell phone that is down inside a subway tunnel?  Unless there are cells in the subway tunnel, you probably won't even get a ping response, much less be able to triangulate in any useful fashion.

And so on.  This movie is so bad it hurts.

The most egregious mistake in the first WarGames movie (apart from the suspension of disbelief about the premise of a computer that could learn well enough to do what it did) was that an acoustic coupler modem can't typically hang up the phone, which means it generally can't be used as an autodialer.  And I'm not quite clear why shorting the microphone would get you a dial tone on a pay phone.  (There were ways to do it back then, but I'm not aware of that being one of them.)  Both of those details are so far beyond what the average person would know, though, that I can overlook them.  This sequel, by contrast was like watching a train wreck in slow motion.  Every time you turned around, there was something else glaringly wrong.  Why can't Hollywood writers at least hire just one person knowledgeable about technology before putting out a screenplay?  These are just the flaws that were obvious off the top of my head at the end of the movie without me actively looking for flaws....  *sigh*",1289260800,31,5179,4.441145281018027

(whose acronym is never explained, to my knowledge) is tied in as an extension of the W.O.P.R. and that a character (or perhaps two, including Joshua) from the original classic is included for additional continuity.  I wish they could have used the same actor and even the same voice synthesizer, but those are the least of the problems with the movie.  I don't like any of the main characters who, unlike Broderick, Sheedy, Coleman, Wood, Clay, and others, are rather two-dimensional and not partcularly likeable.  Worse, they who don't learn a darn thing from their experience, and end the movie as self-absorbed and self-interested as when it began.  In the original David and later Jennifer realize for what they are fighting and the dire consequences of failure, and evince that understanding during their meeting with Falken at his Goose Island retreat.  In this sequel the two fugitives are out to save themselves through most of the movie, and arguably up through the end as well.  Even the concern the hero has for his ailing mother and the ""untold-hero"" story of his father seems tacked on rather than an integral part of the character or the plot.

3380607,2,B0015NORDM,"I must agree with all the people who reviewed this in the resounding negative. The trailer that was shown at the one night 25th anniversary showing of the original was probably better. This version had the feel of a TV movie and without the references to the original characters(WOPR/Joshua and Steven Falken)it probably could have stood on its own. Unfortunately there would not have been a reason to tie it in with the original and thus people would be confused....It was fast paced, almost too fast and predictble yet at the same time, it was longer than necessary. It was a great premise, but perhaps if directed(and written) in the same style of John Badham, it would (could) have been better. Maybe watching it back to back with the original would help it, if only for a bit. The end segment reference makes it unable to stand on its own as without the reference to the end of the original, the entire point of the movie is lost.  Unfortunately, not well written, it's almost as if someone took the original screenplay, changed a few scenes, added a few (non-caring or useless)characters and then hit print and then someone greenlighted it.......I won't even comment on the B and C list actors an their acting ability, or perhaps it is the director's fault. In any case, if you are a fan of the original, I won't insult your intelligence by saying you will or won't like it. I can't assume that you will or won't.

Now that I've seen it, I wish I had back its 100-minute run time, not to mention its overvalued release-date sticker price.  From start to finish, it had the feel of something written by an amateur who has no real knowledge of the world being sketched - whether it be computers, gamers, hackers, business, law enforcement, or government.  Things just happened in the movie, or became close calls, without any real reason or way of getting there.  The explanations that were eventually offered for how the characters knew what they knew had potential but were ultimately ridiculous and fell short of filling the holes or making much of the technical stuff plausible.  There isn't a drop of ""real life"" in this movie, whether it be humor, believability, or a context in which drama can unfold.

Even the action lacked any coherence.  This was especially clear during the Montreal chase, when the protagonists outran cars on foot and it was not at all clear who was involved or why.  It seems to me that not enough thought was put into how this might unfold in an analogous real-life situation.

The pattern followed for the plot was formulaic and not well developed: a paranoid and dystopic vision of society where the antagonists have unlimited power and reach and the protagonists are nobodys who are largely immoral (almost sociopathic) and seem to be able to whip up something out of nothing over and over again to save the day.  A twist added is that the ""bad guys"" really don't have any power at all and ultimately look like fools with oversized egos and paychecks.  This probably most of all gives me the impression of amateur writing at a young level - or perhaps a dumbing-down vector.  Contrast this with the final act of the original WarGames:  the antagonists get in over their heads, but they remain believable all the way through the story.  The source and scope of their power and authority is never in question, nor are their motives.  Each character in the movie is fully developed as a character, with personality and history that are not simply superfluous to the story but instead drive it.  All of the characters, from the smallest to the stars, belong and are well-integrated into the whole.  They seem like real people and we get to know them in that way.

Of course this si not going to be the same as Joshua and Matthew Broderick in 1980. It's different times and requires different themes.
The story is similar, but the only part I didn't like was at the beginning and how the big ""secret"" organization mistakenly targeted a bunch of innocent people as terrorists and the super computer starts chasing and destroying these people's lives.

I heard someone complain about the drone staying aloft and being able to carry nuclear weapons. Just to straighten out the facts. A new planned drone can now stay aloft indefinitely, and current models easily stay aloft 4 days at a time. That would make it very possible for the drone to fly indefinitely throughout the length of the drama. Secondly, the size of the latest drones are as large as an F-16 and have multiple bomb bay receptacles to where they could carry four medium yield nukes and wing mounted weapons. A mixture of weapons that could be very destructive to any major city. in the US.

The acting was good and the movie moved right along with enough techno drama to please most geeks and adventure fans. The young couple were believable and nice enough to elicit my sympathy. I liked the replacement for the Dr. who created WOPR.

I watched the ""making of"" and am an IT tech pro in real life. I can tell they spent a lot of effort and time making sure the technology was fairly realistic. Many of the concepts were based on computing principles..In the documentary the director mentioned that he hired a team of programmers to give technical direction and provide programming for the movie.

8259266,1,B0015NORDM,"Wow. Just... wow. -_-
For being a sequel to the amazing WarGames, this thing is an atrocity.
It makes no sense, redefines the laws of physics, recasts fan favorites, kills off fan favorites, and rips off the original movie in the worst possible way.
This movie is not WarGames. WarGames is an excellent movie. WarGames 2? Just the opposite.
Everything the first movie did right this movie does wrong.
Just like the first movie, the kid gets into trouble with the government for playing a video game. But this time, he doesn't hack in, he just plays an online game that the government set up to find out who's good at it so they can figure out who's a terrorist.
Let me repeat that. The government set up an online game to find out who's good at it so they can figure out who's a terrorist. Because naturally, being good at Call of Duty means you'll actually go out and kill actual people, right? *FACEPALM*
Oh, but wait, that's just the tip of the iceberg. After the kid wins the game, (which again, is just a game and not an actual NORAD supercomputer like last time), they blacklist his IP and spy on him through his webcam AFTER HE'S UNPLUGGED THE COMPUTER. How the hell do you spy on someone with a desktop computer that's NOT PLUGGED IN?!  IT HAS NO POWER SOURCE!  IT WON'T WORK!
The laws of physics aside, he gets arrested, breaks out, goes on the run, and then at the airport two security guys try to tackle him but miss. They tackle some random person's suitcase instead and the kid just walks away. Um... okay?
Then the kid and his unofficial girlfriend (because we need to emulate the first movie somehow) get chased by some scary guys in suits driving a car. They run in a straight line for a full minute, the car right behind them, and somehow the car isn't fast enough to catch them on foot. Seriously? You're in a car! You can't catch up to them even though they went to the Prometheus school of running away from things? Who wrote this trash?
And I could go on with the messed up logic in this movie, but let's move on, shall we? Next the two kids meet the only returning human character from the first film, Dr. Falken. And no, they did not get the same actor to reprise the role. They didn't even cast a British actor! He sounds as American as apple pie this time around! Did you really think no one would notice that?
Then they drive with Falken to a secure location where they meet the only other returning character, and the ONLY good character in this whole movie, JOSHUA! Then Falken flips some switch on Joshua and gives him back his full computing power, explaining that he had him running in a reduced state for years so that the government couldn't find him (not sure why you wouldn't just take him off the internet, but whatever).
Then the evil AI back at the government headquarters finds Joshua, deems him a threat, and blows up the whole place with Joshua and Falken inside, seemingly killing them both. Until 10 minutes later, when Joshua comes back Deus Ex Machina style. Turns out that Falken managed to ""email Joshua's consciousness"" to the government bunker before the building was blown up. Right, because that's how data works. You can now upload and send an entire supercomputer worth of data with only 30 seconds of prior warning. Come on, people!
Then, just like the first movie, the evil AI wants to launch nukes and blow up Washington, but Joshua bombards her with endless board games to... I don't even know anymore. While this was creatively done in the first movie to show Joshua's learning process, and showing how he came to the conclusion that launching the nukes was pointless, in this movie it just serves as a distraction for the evil AI so the humans can regain control. And it will probably give some people seizures with how fast the games flash on screen.
And of course, the games somehow shut the evil AI down, as she says the greatest line from the first movie, ""A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.""
A strange movie. The only winning move is not to watch.

The only thing they got right was the title: THE DEAD CODE.
As is, this movie is dead to me.
