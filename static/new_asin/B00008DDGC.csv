1834822,4,B00008DDGC,"This is a great movie.  I bought it for my 3 & 4 year old. However, there was talk of death which my boys weren't really old enough to understand.  I would highly recommend this movie for children starting in the 2nd grade.",1206057600,30,223,4.162790697674419
1834823,5,B00008DDGC,"This DVD production of the story of Jesus has accomplished exactly what I had hoped for my 3yr old son: an interest in learning about the Lord, His involvement in the lives of those who trust Him, and His love and miracles.  My son often recites (in surprising detail) various scenes from the tale.  One of my fellow brothers in Christ calls my son ""The Little Preacher"" because my son enjoys capturing the attention of those around him so he can retell the story of Jesus.  I understand some reviewing this telling of the story may prefer stricter adherence to various nuances and literary exactness from Scripture - I can appreciate that as I am a literal believer of Scripture.  There is never a perfect retelling of any Biblical story that will appeal to everyone's preference.  As already mentioned, this achieved what I had hoped for my son: help him develop an interest in learning about the Lord, begin building a faith in the Lord, and recognizing a need for relationship with Jesus in his own life.",1191542400,59,1008,4.672316384180791
1834844,1,B00008DDGC,"Although I love Charleton Heston, there was WAAAAY too much talking by Charlton Heston. This is for children and the sooner you get to the meat of the story the better you are to capture their attention",1453420800,,202,4.486486486486487

1834846,5,B00008DDGC,"I was very impressed with the quality. I was half expecting 80's quality or cheesy storytelling, but am very impressed with cartoon quality that matches anything on Netflix and storytelling that entertained adults as well as kids.",1451433600,,230,5.243243243243243

1834851,5,B00008DDGC,This is definitely an older film but it is accurate to scripture and attention getting to the children. I have a 2 year old and he loves it! The sound track is out dated but my son loves the songs. It was a great purchase. And my son always asks to watch Jesus :),1432339200,,263,3.888888888888889

1834853,2,B00008DDGC,"Nice idea, but just not done very well.  It's not this particular story, I bought 4 DVDs produced by the same company - they were all lacking.  Can't put my finger on any one issue, but it doesn't keep my attention and, more importantly, it had the same affect on my grandchildren.",1427068800,,281,4.384615384615385

1834882,1,B00008DDGC,"Thought this would have the same animation that is depicted on the covers, but they indeed DO NOT! Very disappointing! The actual animation looks like it's from 1970. Very poor, and bad for business! This is definitely a BAIT & SWITCH item!",1410220800,4,240,4.738095238095238
1834883,5,B00008DDGC,"My grandson loves all of the Greatest Heroes and Legends of the Bible DVDs!  I have heard all the Bible stories, but I learn things from these DVDs, too! It really helps you remember the Bible stories and the lessons God was teaching us!",1409616000,,237,4.386363636363637

They like it.",1398643200,,108,4.190476190476191
1834908,5,B00008DDGC,"Excellent dvd about the miracles of Jesus. Would be a good teaching tool for Sunday school, Bible class, etc. Perfect for small ones and those who lack or loss the ability to read. Animated characters are more attention getting than real life for some people.",1396224000,,259,4.777777777777778
1834909,5,B00008DDGC,"Very happy with the consistency of the message and sticking to biblical truths. Easy for children to understand without losing the power of the ""word"". I am very pleased and would purchase again.",1395964800,,195,4.9393939393939394

1834911,5,B00008DDGC,"Awesome, love this story. I gave it to my son for Christmas and he watched it many times, and still is watching it in March. Thank you. He has seen other Greates heroes and legend movies and now he wants those also. Im hoping to get him one for his easter basket.  Thank you for making it avalible on Amazon!!I",1394236800,,310,4.166666666666667
1834912,5,B00008DDGC,"There are few Biblically sound videos for girls and boys 4 years and older.

This video is a gem.

Since it deals with just the ""Miracles of Jesus""  there are no scenes that
would bother a little one.

The series as a whole is more appropriate for 1st graders and older.

Great foundational study, in cartoon form, for any Christian family.",1393977600,,340,4.508196721311475
1834913,5,B00008DDGC,great way to tell the bible stories for the younger kids. My grandchildren loved watching the movie. Planning to buy more of the dvds. Charles Heston did a great job telling these stories.,1390780800,,188,4.7272727272727275
1834914,5,B00008DDGC,"My 4 year old daughter currently looks at lots of non-Christian children's stories and age-appropriate developmental videos, and as great as they all are, I was looking for Christian material that would get her attention and keep her as equally or even more excited. This series did just that and after the first viewing, she repeated looking at it and the others which I purchased.  Think I got some winners here.",1388102400,2,414,4.830985915492958
1834915,5,B00008DDGC,I got this as Christmas gift for 3 years old son. we didn't play it yet. he will love it!,1387756800,,89,3.5
1834916,4,B00008DDGC,"I like it, but trying to compete with sonic the hedgehog, mickey mouse and sponge-bob, this movie lost out. My child watched it once, I think. Its well plotted, not sure how detailed it is, definitely for younger kids.",1384905600,,218,4.615384615384615
1834917,4,B00008DDGC,My sister says her 2 children love these and sit attentively. It's a great way to introduce children to the love of Jesus Christ.,1374796800,,129,4.416666666666667
1834918,5,B00008DDGC,Thank you so much for your promptness in getting this item to us in adequate time for us to give it to our great grandson for his birthday.  The packaging and travel condition were excellent also.  The item was in super condition on arrival.,1371772800,,241,4.454545454545454
1834919,5,B00008DDGC,With a Charlton Heston introduction this DVD is a pleasant collection of Jesus's miracles.  This DVD is similar to the animated old testament collection of stories.  Both were enjoyable.,1370736000,,186,5.379310344827586
1834920,5,B00008DDGC,GOOD FOR KIDS A SOMETHING GOOD TO WATCH INSTEAD OF SMUT AND VIOLENCE GET IT FOR YOUR KIDS AND YOURSELF,1370563200,,102,4.15
1834921,4,B00008DDGC,"MY boys are 5 and 6 and this DVD has a lot of explenations and not really the kind of art work that captures small kids attention. My boys now have an idea of who God and Jesus is but besides that, they didn't understand much.",1370476800,,226,3.9347826086956523
1834922,2,B00008DDGC,"I grew up watching fairly low budget productions of Biblical media, but this one is a bit much.  My child doesn't mind it because she is little and loves Jesus (and anything to do with Him!)  The animation and action are just very odd; men growling because they are mad about something; weird, repetitive songs.  Just a little bit disappointed, and no- the intro with Charlton Heston did not influence my purchase of the dvd!",1369785600,7,425,4.64
1834923,5,B00008DDGC,great movie about Jesus. something for young kids to understand. they wanna watch it every day. would highly recommend  it,1367020800,,122,5.1

1834946,5,B00008DDGC,"This movie is great!  Short, sweet and to the point with little ones. My daughter is 2 and she will sit still for it.",1364860800,,117,3.875
1834947,5,B00008DDGC,Bought for my neices children so they could learn aboub our Lorb Jesus Christ and have fun while learning. I would recommend to everyone Pastor Bob.,1364515200,,148,4.730769230769231
1834948,5,B00008DDGC,I had it when i was a child thought it would be good for my children to watch it instead of the rest of the nonsense on tv these days,1363910400,,133,3.466666666666667
1834949,5,B00008DDGC,I highly recommend this video. I used it as a Bible Study tool for my nieces and nephew. It held their attention.,1362355200,,113,4.181818181818182
1834950,5,B00008DDGC,Bought this for my step son so he could start watching more positive shows and he is thrilled with it which makes me a happy as well.,1362268800,,133,3.962962962962963
1834951,2,B00008DDGC,"I have always admired Charleston Heston, and purchased this DVD because of his involvement.  But...the quality wasn't there, and it certainly didn't hold the interest of a preschooler.  Not sure who this video is made for.",1359417600,2,222,5.138888888888889
1834952,5,B00008DDGC,"Why is this video awesome:  It is very entertaining way of telling the stories of the Bible.  Our kids have watched this so many times it would have worn out if it was a record.  Don't let Charleston's intro scare you, just FF over it, and lift him up in prayer for producing some of the best cartooned Bible stories ever produced.  I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior in 2003 and have grown leaps and bounds in my learning of the Bible...and even I learned many insights from these Bible stories!  Amazing!
I believe the animations help focus the story and bring to light aspects you don't get from just 'reading' the Bible.  For example, when the apostles were in the boat, the Bible does not have illustrations to show what it was like, but I have no doubt, it was serious storm...when you see it in action, you get a whole new dimension.
Today, our world and culture will try to tell you can do whatever you want, as long as it feels good...Never did previous generations face such temptations.  This video can help you bring the Bible to kids who you might otherwise not be able to talk to.  Let them watch, then if they have questions, you can discuss.",1357516800,3,1161,4.392523364485982
1834953,5,B00008DDGC,This movies is excellent for young children.  It was produced on a level that they can enjoy.  My granddaughter loved the movie,1357257600,,127,4.7272727272727275
1834974,2,B00008DDGC,I ordered this for my kids thinking it would be nice for them to see the Miracles of Jesus visually.  The graphics are poor quality and the message is not accurate. The disciple Peter is made out to be an angry person and they include things that are not stated in the Bible.  I would not recommend this video.,1340236800,16,310,4.237288135593221
1834975,5,B00008DDGC,"I've been going through several different series of Biblical DVD's for my toddler, so that he can get a better understanding of the stories in the Bible.  Content-wise, this is the best DVD series I have found.  It doesn't have time-traveling children as one series does and the story is closely in line with the Bible.  It begins with a several minute opening from Charlton Heston, then gets into the story.

Unfortunately, it is a little too advanced for a 2.5 year old.  I would definitely recommend it though for an older child because of the amount of talking and slower pace of the story line.",1337558400,7,599,4.613207547169812
1834976,1,B00008DDGC,"The DVD would not let us skip to the main menu or even fast forward through the ""ads"" at the beginning.  Having to sit through several minutes of commercials with no way around it is enough to make me want to rip the darn thing and remove all the extras.",1335916800,8,254,4.08
1834977,5,B00008DDGC,"This is truly a fabulous children's cartoon in regards to the life of Jesus, it is accurate and based on the NIV which is very sufficient. I am a KJV reader and thats my personal choice but I read the NIV as well to cross reference. A MUST HAVE FOR YOUR CHILDREN! You will all be blessed by this cartoon.",1319673600,10,304,4.083333333333333
1834978,5,B00008DDGC,These dvd's help make children understand and see the bible characters as real. They know Jesus and this makes him even more loving to them.  We all enjoy these stories and will continue to buy more of them.  I have about 8 now. They have their favorite stories but they can't take their eyes off of any of them.  I use them when traveling in the car going back and forth to sabbath school.  The songs are cute and catchy.  I have 3 grandchildren ages 1 to 3 and have even shown them to a 5 year old whose parents are now going to get some for her. I highly recommend them.,1289347200,8,573,4.080357142857143

1834981,5,B00008DDGC,"Even though some of the information is inaccurate, my grandchildren love watching this dvd. My 3 yr old is always asking for the ""JESUS"" movie. Not just on Sabbath, but throughout the week as well. That is what counts.

To me, it is worth the money.",1272672000,4,249,4.413043478260869
1834982,5,B00008DDGC,Second time I have purchased this video.  The first set went through 5 grandchildren.  Now I am purchasing for great granchildren.,1271116800,10,130,5.142857142857143
1834983,5,B00008DDGC,My boys are 5 and 2.  We have 3 of the movies from this collection.  They are Wonderful!!  The most wonderful thing is my boys would rather watch these movies over any others.  It thrills my heart.  They are learing an incredible lesson that is right from the bible.  I often hear them repeating lines.  AWESOME!!,1242172800,30,313,4.482142857142857
