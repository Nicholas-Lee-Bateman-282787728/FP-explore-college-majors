It features segments that take an inside look at the technical aspect of racing and the cars featured in the NASCAR Winston Cup series, the Winston Top Fuel drag racing series and the CART Fed Ex Championship series of which I am a fan of and is the reason why I bought the DVD.  The segment on the CART series features an inside look at the Newman/Hass team of Michael Andretti and Christian Fittipaldi.  Also featured is some very good technical information about how Champ Cars work and racing setup etc.  It features footage from Homestead and The 1998 Long Beach Grand Prix.  Mario Andretti is interviewed and some vintage footage of him racing is also shown.  I didn't get a chance to watch the NASCAR or the Drag Racing segment but I'm sure they are just as interesting.  The DVD is featured in 5.1 and DTS so if you have a good system then this will sound pretty good.  Overall, a pretty good DVD.",975369600,18,1080,4.469387755102041
