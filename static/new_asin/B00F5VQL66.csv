8612511,5,B00F5VQL66,"My son LOVED watching this on Netflix.  However, as they sometimes do, Netflix removed this from their streaming service.  My 2 year old kept asking for ""meow party"" so I had to find a solution. I came to Amazon, which I usually do, and found this gem for only $1.99! I just had to buy it for my son.

There is another DVD being sold for the same price and I almost bought that one. I kept scrolling and came across this version. Not only is it the same DVD for the same price, it comes with a bonus gift: a puzzle! Who wouldn't want extra goodies for the same cost?!

This is an adorable DVD and keeps my son entertained so I can accomplish things I need to get done without him all over me. So worth it and definitely recommend!",1458777600,,730,4.119718309859155
