8456485,5,B0054DPLMU,"Excellent quality considering the game was played over 3-decades ago. While spending summers in Westhampton, New York; I was able to watch Red Sox games on cable and became a Sox fan over time... Also recommend the Pirates-Yankees Game 7 release...",1380153600,,248,5.073170731707317
8456486,5,B0054DPLMU,Watched the entire game on this DVD after reading the fabulous book Game Six by Mark Frost.  Knowing all that went on before this game took place and all the related stories just made watching the real game from start to finish that much more enjoyable.  I was so glad that the DVD showed the game in 16x9 aspect ratio rather than the 1.33:1 that most people saw it on TV back in 1975.  And the film quality was pretty good as well based upon when this game took place.  Highly recommend.,1377820800,2,488,4.271739130434782
8456487,3,B0054DPLMU,Description is misleading . There is no bonus radio audio. It is only available in the complete 10 disc greatest game collection as a bonus disc.,1370995200,,145,4.615384615384615
8456488,5,B0054DPLMU,"I'm not old enough to have seen this game live on TV, but I've always wanted to see it, especially after seeing the clips from the Ken Burns documentary. There's nothing that compares to watching it play out in real time, the shots of Luis Tiant's father, and a network broadcast from the days when they really wanted to show you the game, not sensationalize everything. The game is sensational enough on its own.",1342915200,4,413,4.594594594594595
8456489,4,B0054DPLMU,"This games rates 4 stars on the strength of...the game. Younger fans won't believe the almost total lack of statistics (those that are provided are spelled out in complete sentences!), instant replay, and the other real-time graphics that give the modern broadcast the look and feel of a computer game. What you do get is a great extra inning game played by two marvelous teams--decked out in appropriately awful 70s double knits--featuring four Hall of Fame players (and Pete Rose) and a HOF manager, Sparky Anderson. In 1975 the players had not yet begun to indulge in obnoxious self-congratulation: Geronimo, Carbo, and most of all Carlton Fisk don't stand at the plate to admire their clutch home runs, though Fisk's body language waving his drive ""fair"" provided a World Series highlight for the ages. A marvelous extra inning game, the high point of an excellent World Series that brought many Americans back to their national game as the Vietnam era drew to a close. The reason for four stars? The production values. I have a video tape of this game and know how the color in that medium faded. Whatever it's source for the broadcast, it's hard to believe that MLB could not spare the time and expense to do a computerized restoration in what it's touting as one of its ""Greatest Games."" Perhaps this game--like the great work of the baseball art that it is--will one day get a proper restoration. One last thing: the announcing team of Dick Stockton, Tony Kubek, and especially Joe Garagiola is dreadful. I haven't tried listening to the radio broadcast audio along with the game. Even if it's slightly out of synch, it could hardly be worse.",1323302400,6,1650,4.813380281690141
