7968586,5,B00006G8NJ,I real watch this movie only because Bret Hart was in it. But it is a real sweet coming to age film for young kids.,1133654400,3,115,3.64

It is one of those ""comfortable"" films that just made us feel good watching it. I plan to buy it, even on the dreaded VHS!",1045699200,4,287,3.8813559322033897
7968588,5,B00006G8NJ,"I watched a friends 'screener' tape of this film (it was nominated for an Emmy for best direction of a childrens film), and found it really enchanting. The characters are smart and funny but not in a snide way, the kids all have a depth and intelligence about them that made it a pleasure to watch.
The story is not terribly complex; a young girl is about to turn sixteen years old and starts to find 'clues' that her parents may be getting a divorce, so she devises various plots to keep them together, and at the same time she is falling in love for the first time. Simple, yet nicely told in a comedic way.
The music was fun, the acting uniformly terrific, and it was filmed in a very unique and interesting way.
I'd highly recommend this film, especially if you happen to have a high spirited 13 year old daughter.",1032393600,10,818,4.352941176470588
