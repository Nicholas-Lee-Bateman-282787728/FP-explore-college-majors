3688255,3,B001LMSP2G,"Rolando Villazon poures his heart into every role he sings but sometimes it's just a little bit too much. He is 100% all the time from start to end and this makes the climaxes in the drama and music vanish. I would wish he could economize with his dramatic gestures and acting, and then let go in the big scenes. Gounod's score has enough drama and high voltage music already.
The same with his singing. I think his 100% attitude has damaged him vocally. He sounds strained in this production, he omits some top notes in the third and fifth act and sometimes hides behind Machaidzes voice in the duets. Occasionally he shouts more than he sings. Machaidze has a very large secure voice and looks a bit like Netrebko, but without her charisma and charm.",1254873600,11,752,4.536764705882353

An excellent recording from all points of view - technically, artistic singing and acting, costumes ....
One of the best tributes which can be given to this opera performance is to be able to find it rivetting despite being fully familiar with the story. Nino Machaidze singing Juliette is a real find. Not only beautiful to look at, she has a superb and powerful voice and acts the part to perfection. Rolando Villazon partners her as Romeo and puts his heart and soul into the role. The rest of the cast are also very strong to make Gounod's Romeo and Juliette extremely musically satisfying. The fight scenes are brilliantly choreographed and very dramatic. The same set is cleverly used throughout and the costumes are brilliant. No apologies for such a rave review as this production is truly exceptional. If you love opera, this is a MUST for your collection.",1242000000,14,1137,5.8969696969696965
3688257,5,B001LMSP2G,"I was amazed at the production values, considering, the Von Trapp Singers sang there prior to their departure from the Nazi's, because the stage area is not conducive for theatricals/opera.
This was an original and delightful and masterfully executed production.
For me,I knew of none of the performers, but after this I shall never forget them.
Ingenuity in production, and even more clever was the direction.
8 out of 5 stars. The BluRay is exceptionally well recorded.",1240099200,5,471,5.12987012987013
8318824,4,B001LMSP2G,A wonderful performance whose whole is somewhat more than the sum of its parts. Video and staging are lovely.,1511395200,,109,4.7894736842105265
8318825,1,B001LMSP2G,"I received this as a gift in the original sealed packaging, but my Vizio bluray player cannot read the disk at all.  It shows ""No Disk"" and reopens the tray.  I have several other Deutsche Grammophon bluray disks which play perfectly, but this one cannot be read at all.",1469491200,,270,4.489795918367347
8318826,5,B001LMSP2G,Simply marvelous performance at the Salzburg Festival.  Nino was called in late in the game to replace an ailing Anna Netrebko -- and Nino was only 22 when she performed as Juliette.  WOW!  What a gifted soprano!  And Rolando is the marvelously passionate Romeo!  Incomparable duo!  This is truly a must have!  I bought 2 copies just to make sure I'd never be without!,1415836800,,368,4.65625
8318827,5,B001LMSP2G,"Too bad it only comes in Blu-ray as I prefer playing my DVDs on my laptop but it was worth loading it in the player to watch it on the big screen. Villazon is Romeo in character and able to prove quite well that he can get serious and pull off the really heavy dramatic roles when called to. His singing is always impeccable and with this cast of players making up his clansmen, the vibrant costuming and impressive fight scene choreography, the work of Sher and Large is commendable. The chemistry between Villazon and Machaidze was intimate and tender while his portrayal of a hotheaded young stud was just as thrilling! The fight scenes I heard were the talk of the Festival with critics far and wide gushing over how well done they were. I thought the scenes where everyone dies (Mercutio,Tybalt, Romeo and Juliette) were the best! though Russell Braun needs to be mindful that when the show is being taped for broadcast or DVD, the camera close-up will catch your heavy breathing after the strenuous fight scene ends and you are supposed to be ""dead"". (Nevertheless he pulled off a spectacular lead up to and final dying even with that little oops) One signature of a great opera performer is not just his/her singing ability but how well they can convincingly die on stage as someone always dies in the end! The opera starts out a little silly with Nino Machaidze's awkward attempts to convey the youthfulness of Juliette by walking around the villa like a tomboy as she is being summoned to her 16th birthday/ coming-out party. When she finally sheds the cliche she redeems herself the minute she sings the ""Ah! Je veux vivre"" and brings Julliette firmly into young womanhood and leaves her there! Her delivery of the ""Je veux vivre"" was just beautiful! vibrant and exciting! You'll enjoy this no matter what.",1411776000,,1816,4.695924764890282
8318828,5,B001LMSP2G,"This 2008 production by Bartlett Sherat the Salzburg Festival makes a virtue out of the minimalist staging opportunities of the cloistered venue to produce a fiercely dramatic rendering. The cast are completely at one with their respective roles and the orchestra under the energetically attentive Yannick Nezet-Seguin is excellent.

The two key roles of Romeo (Rolando Villazon) and Juliet (Nino Machaidze) are perfectly cast with Villazon being passionate and finally desolate as the drama progresses and with Machaidze being delightfully playful, then passionate and finally distraught. Both sing with total conviction and with complete technical and musical assurance.

The supporting roles do not let the production down for a moment. Tybalt (Juan Gatell) and Mercutio (Russell Braun) are utterly believable in their respectively driven roles. Susanne Resmark makes the most of her role of the nurse, Gertrude, bringing out the necessary humorous counterbalance to the tragic events unfolding around her. The remaining roles of Caplet (Falk Struckmann), Paris (Mathias Hausmann), the duke of Verona (Christian van Horn), and Frere Laurant (Mikhail Petrenko) are all performed equally well.

The chosen cast for this production underlines once again how fortunate we all are to be living at a time when there are so many fine young singers who are able to act as convincingly as this in addition to possessing fine vocal techniques. The days of stand and deliver are thankfully seemingly at an end. We are also fortunate to be living at a time when recording technology is as good as this almost by default. The combination of fine acting/singing and modern recording technology make for a potent mix.

A special word therefore needs to be added about the effectiveness of the production even within such a limited set. Key moments such as Juliet's death are handled well and the sword fighting sequences are especially convincing. In summary this is a compelling tale of a society in sharp decline and is vividly portrayed as such.

The camera work of the Brian Large team is as sympathetic as always and the imaging is a sharp as we can now expect with HD technology. The sound is full ranging and presented in both DTS 5.0 and stereo formats.

There are three short bonuses of between 1.27' and 4.38' in the form of introductions and glances behind the scenes but the fourth one about `Love and Death in Verona' is the most interesting and is slightly longer at 7.47'. None of these will be a crucial factor in deciding to purchase this disc or not of course.

This is a finely delivered and compelling version of this Gounod opera and is arguably the best available at the moment. This situation is likely to be secure for quite some time yet and as such is likely to give purchasers considerable satisfaction and enjoyment. It is worth emphasising that this Blu-ray version of this recording offers further technical advantages of clarity and recorded realism over the alternative DVD presentation.",1345420800,,3007,5.0872210953346855
8318829,4,B001LMSP2G,"When I buy opera on DVD, it's because I want to watch as well as hear. Unfortunately, of late most stagings are disappointing at best, offensive at worst. This one had a bit of both. And i'm getting tired of the new fad that dictates there must be action during the overture! The singing, however, being the most important, did not entirely disappoint. Sure, Villazon sounds a bit strained, but still. Machaidze I found a little shrill, her sound cold. Perhaps I'm unfairly comparing her to Mexican soprano Maria Alejandres, who I had the pleasure to hear on stage in the same role shortly before buying this DVD, and who I consider ideal for the role of Juliette. But all in all, I am pleased with it. Sound is wonderful and well balanced.",1339027200,,740,4.571428571428571
8318830,5,B001LMSP2G,"I watch operas on a 106"" screen with a 7.1 surround setup for music and have watched this opera a few times now.
Picture quality is fine, as with most blu rays.
The soundstage could be a bit wider. It exceeds the front corner speakers by may be a foot. The applause comes from front and sides. Overall, it gives you the impression of sitting somewhere around row 10. A wider soundstage puts you more up front, which I prefer.
Most operas have the voices of the principal singers move along with their bodies on stage. Here, the voices are sent to the center with no left/right movement. The video direction keeps the principals 98% of the time centered, so audio and video go together and I got used to it, although I prefer it the other way.
Orchestra, chorus and principals are very well recorded and well balanced. The orchestra never drowns the voices. I liked all the principals, and Machaidze is the star. Villazon might be overacting a bit at some scenes, but better than underacting. The two did make a believable couple for me. (I could have done without the rape scene in the beginning, Lord Capulet hitting Tibald and some other stage effects.)
So besides the few shortcomings, I still give it 5 stars for the overall quality of sound recording, orchestra playing, singing and acting.

Edit 5/4/2018: After a firmware update, my Sony Blu-ray player S6500 is no longer playing it, it tells me this is a data disc. My new SonyX700 won't play it either, nor will the Panasonic 200UB.",1298160000,3,1491,4.605263157894737
8318831,5,B001LMSP2G,"Absolutely one of the best opera productions I have seen.  Machaidze is the best soprano since Sutherland.  And she can act.  Villazon's voice is probably the best I have heard him yet.  The conductor from Canada is young but quite frankly, a total musician and one of the best. BluRay picture is incredible.",1283472000,,308,4.754716981132075
8318832,5,B001LMSP2G,Nino Machaidze is a superb Juliet. She has a wonderful voice and is great to look at. A totally convincing performance. The staging was a little limited but did not distract from the overall presentation. I will watch this opera over and aver again. Well worth owning.,1273968000,2,268,4.723404255319149
8318833,5,B001LMSP2G,"Singing, music, acting, costumes, & BD technology are all excellent. Unfortunately, the staging tried too hard to be creative. The single set for all acts, even though the lighting was effective, did not fit any of the acts well. (ie.  The elevated center part of the stage was too big for the bed in Juliet's bedroom scene, but served no useful purpose in the other scenes.) Also, I don't agree with the directors that feel there must be stage action during overtures and preludes. Since the (mis)direction was not as intrusive as some I have seen, I still give 5 stars in spite of the staging.",1264636800,7,595,4.613207547169812
