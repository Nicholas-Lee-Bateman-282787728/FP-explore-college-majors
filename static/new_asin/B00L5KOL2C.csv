8663854,4,B00L5KOL2C,"nothing wrong with this item as far as the seller is concerned but i never hear Alain Prost's name mentioned even once  and it wasn't quite what i expected. Geared more towards your nascar armchair type fan  than a hardcore F1, IMSA, Endurance and supercar Road Racing fanatic  like myself. But it goes back to the director and producer not the person who sold the item.",1453334400,,370,4.575757575757576
8663855,5,B00L5KOL2C,"Great insider's view of Senna's champion McLaren Formula 1 team and all the thought, technology, science, practice and mental strength that go into winning Formula 1 races. The film includes interesting and thought-provoking interviews with the late Senna, showing his remarkable intelligence and command of the art of racing. These moments are all the more profound because he is gone now. Just plain great, lots of good interviews with McLaren staff, including team mate Berger, who is amongst the most experienced Formula One drivers of all time. Of interest was a young man trying to work his way up from testing to driving Formula 1. He was very articulate, motivated and skilled, yet only the tender age of 21. This was a real eye-opener for Formula 1 newcomers such as myself, who need to learn more about what goes on behind the scenes, and the requisite manpower to keep a Formula 1 team rolling. I can strongly recommended viewing this film; it was very relaxing and informative.",1430438400,,989,4.92814371257485
