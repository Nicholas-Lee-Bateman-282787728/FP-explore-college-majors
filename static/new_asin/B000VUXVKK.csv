8220174,5,B000VUXVKK,"Got this set for Christmas. I'm a BJJ purple belt and wanted to add more leglocks to my submission game. First two discs are takedowns directly to leglocks, while the other 4 discs are leglocks from inside guard (3), outside guard (4), across the side (5) and from the mount and back (6).  Was impressed with the variety and positions from which the attacks come from. I would dock the set a half star because of the production, which is good, but still a few years old, but it's not enough to dock it a full star. Other than that, a great set that I hope to start implementing into my game soon.",1294099200,7,596,4.274336283185841
