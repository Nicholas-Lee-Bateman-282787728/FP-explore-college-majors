7841704,4,6303248675,My favorite of the three SatAM VHS releases. Hooked on Sonics and especially Warped Sonic are two great episodes from the series. But the downside is that the episodes are edited from their original ABC airings. I was disappointed the Super Sonic DVD compilation doesn't include these.,1139702400,,285,5.085106382978723
7841705,5,6303248675,When Sonic The Hedgehog first hit ABC in the fall of 1993 I was 11. Now 21.  I loved shows based upon video games.  I remember watching the primtime special that advertised this show.  The video is good for anyone who wishes to go back or were to young to watch it the first time.,1078012800,2,280,4.054545454545455
7841706,4,6303248675,"Two of the more interesting episodes of the series, both revolving around the characters' relationships and jealousies involving Princess Sally.",1018137600,,144,6.25
7841707,5,6303248675,"It's pretty pathetic that I didn't get up early enough to tape this show while it was on ABC:(
This is (IMO) the best Sonic animated series they made, 500x's better than the terrible kiddie one where they never showed  the rest of the freedom fighters. I may think this b/c I've read the comics  since 1993, and always preferred their drawings of Robotnik (which were  based on this series). And Princess Sally Acorn is a great character! I  just wish they would've had Knuckles and the Chaotix in it!  It's too  bad they cancelled this show and never released some of the better  episodes. Oh well...check out the comics if you want the best in Sonic  stories. (currently they're doing a Sega Dreamcast adaptation)",947808000,4,715,4.664
7841708,5,6303248675,"Not the BEST Sonic episodes (not that they even released the BEST ones on video at all) but if you're looking for the SatAM series, this is the only way you'll see it, short of bootlegging.  If you watched it on USA, you  didn't see it all because they cut parts out.  So, if you didn't see this  show when it was on ABC, you were short-changed and you probably NEED to  buy this.  It is worth it though.  This show was absolutely great, I'm  sixteen now and I'm still saying that.  It was such a shame to see it  cancelled.  So enjoy it however you can.",923097600,,554,4.08411214953271
