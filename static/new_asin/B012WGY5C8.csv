7358820,4,B012WGY5C8,"Nice coming-of-age/wrapping-up-life flick, throwing in football and absolution. Glimpses of Mickey Rourke's acting prowess punches a speed bag with quick jabs at redemption & forgiveness, but I would've preferred a longer bout...",1443398400,,229,6.1875
7358821,3,B012WGY5C8,"Great roles for Mickey Rourke unfortunately come few and far between these days, but Ashby is most definitely one of his best in recent years.

Rourke plays Ashby, a retired assassin with three months to live who becomes a mentor to his new 17 year old neighbor. This story has been done to death in recent years (Gran Torino and St. Vincent, just to name a few), but Ashby's previous line of work keeps the film from feeling overly recycled.

The movie is full of cliches and some crummy dialogue, but Rourke, perfectly balancing a tough guy persona with a heartfelt man full of regret, makes it worth watching.",1443312000,16,612,4.605504587155964
7358822,5,B012WGY5C8,"One word for this film - awesome. Don't miss this film. It rocks. Performances by all are solid. Just the scenes in Ed's (played by Nat Wolf) literary class are worth the watch but then there is so many more excellent scenes.  It is like eating a box of chocolates, with each piece you feel ecstasy and upon emptying the box you feel a total sugar high. Ashby, played by Rourke,  in my opinion, gives an Academy Award performance. Excellent performances from Sarah Silverman and Emma Roberts.",1443312000,6,492,4.64367816091954

7358837,2,B012WGY5C8,"The acting & storyline were great, and everything was rolling along smoothly until whoever is in charge of such things (the director? the producers, maybe?) screwed up with the props not once but twice. First, Rourke's character undergoes a ""test"" at a hospital. It's implied that the scanner is an MRI but there's little attention to detail in several aspects of the scene as well as the following scene with his doctor. It's stupid stuff, like the sort of thing they used to do in medical shows on TV, like hanging x-rays upside down and/or backwards or showing 2 different images from 2 obviously different patients. In any case, it was dumb on the part of whoever is in charge of such things on a movie set, but forgivable in that it does happen.

A few minutes later they fail miserably again, with another MRI machine, only this one is ostensibly parked inside a character's house. Yeah... it was that bad and that poorly thought out. It was placed in a regular room with all the normal trappings of a regular room: desks, chairs, shelves, etc full of various metallic objects just a few feet away while the scanner was supposedly ""working"" for the second time with no receiver coil. There are literally too many things wrong with both scenes to mention. Nobody in the movie's production did their homework on this stuff, and it ruined the entire movie. Remember the old Jet Li flick where he's fighting in a hospital and ""flips the switch"" to turn an MRI scanner on, it yanks the bad guy's gun out of his hand, then he ""flips the switch"" again to turn it off, retrieving the gun? That was so far-fetched that you had to just shake your head at how bad it was and move on to the rest of the action. This was worse because it was a serious moment where they were trying to pawn it off as really real. Couldn't bear to watch any more after that, and the producers get an F- for screwing up what was otherwise a very promising movie.",1473897600,,1936,4.468926553672317

7358839,4,B012WGY5C8,Ashby Holt (Mickey Rourke) is a retired C.I.A. agent who finds out he has some major health issues and doesn't have long to live.  Ed Wallis (Nat Wolff) Ashby's neighbor has problems of his own and could use a little help.  Ashby and Ed become good friends and Ashby makes Ed a deal that he can't refuse.  I don't want to say much more about this movie because it would be very easy to give away what happens.

7358844,5,B012WGY5C8,"Hello folks,

Every once in a while something random occurs that is magic. Ashby is on of those instances.  I would recommend anyone with a bit of a twisted sense of humor and loads of common sense watch this.  This movie gently mocks today's narcissistic youth and society in general, with a unique story that encapsulates more than can be written in this short little ditty.  Watching this movie is time well spent, if you can handle the brutal honesty and have the capacity to laugh at yourself, because there are a lot of us out today who will discover themselves in of many of this movie's very humorous critiques on modern society.  Hat's off to Tony McNamara for a great little screen play.  Micky Rourke and Sara Silverman couldn't have been better choices and Nat Wolff is brilliant.",1467504000,,792,4.661870503597123

A very watchable movie with sympathetic characters and excellent performances. Recommended.",1463875200,,362,5.7924528301886795
7358859,5,B012WGY5C8,"How did I miss this movie when it came out!?! What a fantastic story and the actors were above and beyond what I expected. Nat Wolff plays the boy-becoming-a-man character. I've seen this character before, and I'll watch the character over and over if the actor can make it fresh for me each time and Mr. Wolff does that for me. Ed Wallis is a great character that sees the world from a different perspective. How he sees the world does not change his innate curiosity for it or how others are so blind to it. He keeps moving forward on his path. Wow! Sarah Silverman has more to her than what the industry is showing. I hope she can keep this side of her in front more than Adam Sandler did. Punch Drunk Love and Spanglish showed his potential and then it seems he gave up. Sarah please keep it going. I saved Mickey Rourke for last. I fell in love with his acting ability from his first movies. Then he became a boxer and then a plastic surgery celebrity. Iron Man started to show that his acting skills were coming back. This movie really lets the actor start acting again. This is well worth the time to sit and enjoy this movie. If movie industry would start being smarter with the advertisements of movies, this would have not been lost in the shuffle when it was originally out in the movie theaters.",1463788800,,1307,4.360655737704918

7358862,4,B012WGY5C8,"This tale of two seemingly opposite individuals forming a bond certainly isn't a new idea to film, but this outing puts a nice spin on the ball.

Here's the scoop. Ed Wallis (Nat Wolff) has moved from Oregon to Virginia with his newly divorced mom played by Sarah Silverman. A school assignment, involving his having to write about an older person, puts him in the path of his grumpy-ish neighbor Ashby Holt (Mickey Rourke). What begins as a battle of the generation gap ends up with the two helping each other navigate their lives.

This tackles quite a wide array of subjects. Being a man (minus the macho), seeing things as they really are and not your rationalization of them. It is also about a young man needing to know he can take a hit and still keep going. That his mom is a sexual being as well as his mom and he can be friends with a girl for whom he feels deeply. Honor, redemption also enter the fray. These things are handled with varying degrees of success but it's good they are even tackled. This is not unlike Clint Eastwood's ""Grand Torino.""

All the key actors do a decent job. I like Sarah Silverman, so I could have used more of her, but everyone else stepped up to the plate. I was surprised to see Rourke here. This is more of an indy type flick and, aside from ""The Wrestler,"" I didn't figure him for this kind of role. All the camera work, editing, sound, et al. is on par with the project.

I just liked this flick. I liked the story, the characters and the outcome. More than comfort food, but less than a 4 star restaurant.",1463011200,,1552,4.341379310344828

7358867,4,B012WGY5C8,"Interesting to see this getting pretty good reviews here on average - and I agree. This movie is good entertainment. It deals with topics like jocks in high school, football, redemption for deadly sins, finding courage, romance (of course) in a mostly light hearted but not corny way. Not even close to the level ""Harold and Maude"" hit in its day (there's a cute little reference to that movie in it, actually) but still a movie that is much better than the pretty lousy ""official"" reviews have yuo believe. Mickey Rourke has been in much worse roles and Sarah Silverman does a great portrait of a very quirky single mom.",1461369600,,621,4.654545454545454

7358869,5,B012WGY5C8,Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Well acted. Story seemed fully believable (except for the foundation aspect - I doubt that a CIA assassin would confide to a high schooler of his retired profession). That aspect was a nice fantasy way of presenting a good story.,1461024000,,259,4.909090909090909
7358870,5,B012WGY5C8,"I never expected Mickey Rourke to make me love him in a part as much as I loved Ruth Gordon in ""Harold & Maude""...but he did.  Nat Wolff is endearing and relatable as an oppressed teen with parents who have ceased to make him a priority.  He pulls the part off with a neat mix of optimism, smartass, pinches of Holden Caufield and Ferris Bueller, seasoned with insight, cynicism and survivor-savvy so that you don't ever see him as a victim. Sarah Silverman is hilarious as his dating-obsessed mother.  This movie will be on my hard-to-resist-watching-repeats list.",1461024000,,565,4.804123711340206

He wants to try out for the football team but is shy. He likes the geeky Eloise (Emma Roberts) who shares his crush. A high school assignment to talk to an ""old"" person causes him to form a friendship with Ashby (Mickey Rourke) who has a secret past we soon uncover and a few months to live. Ed becomes Ashby's chauffeur as he tries to make amends and teach Ed to grow a set.

The film is a comedy drama and a little dark at times and quirky at other times. It is also a romance and could be used as a date film. Enjoyable performances.

7358950,3,B012WGY5C8,"This was an okay movie. It is based on a student/mentor type of relationship. I easily identified with the characters but couldn't take them seriously. I also enjoyed the underlying message: life is temporal, live it to the fullest, don't be afraid of it.

I didn't give it a perfect star rating because to me, it wasn't perfect. I didn't resonate with the comical essence that permeated throughout the entire movie. As another reviewer noted, the fault was in the writing, not so much the acting.

This movie depicted situations that show up in real life. In real life though, there are moments of joy contrasted by those of sorrow, moments of laughter and moments of anguish, a time to laugh and a time to cry, a time to joke and a time to be serious. All of life is not a perpetual joke. So some of the acting scripts (particularly the mom's), the music chosen for the background, all diluted the effectiveness of the movie to fully engage, for me, to pull me in, to really hook my heart and emotions in a potent manner.

Mickey Rourke's character was an assassin, for instance, and he was suffering from the ghosts created by such profession. A serious matter, a segment of experience that in real life would be no joking matter. He is also diagnosed with a terminal condition, another serious matter. He distanced himself from his wife and daughter, which also causes him anguish, another serious matter. He is a tortured soul, but that isn't properly passed on to the viewer because of all the light, joking behavior at the periphery of these serious matters. By the time the ending arrived, I couldn't really feel sad, couldn't suffer along with the characters because everything throughout the movie was a joking matter. The power of cinema is the potential to grab you by the collar and pull you into the dramas depicted on the screen, when the script is good (well balanced). This one just tickled the tip of my nose.

I only gave it three stars because it wasn't bad enough to make me click the X on the right top corner of the screen.",1447545600,,2046,4.581967213114754

It was good just to see Mickey on the screen again, because he is a legendary actor who always creates magic with his sensitive, bad-ass characters.

Rourke's  brilliant roller-coaster career spans 30+ years and to me, his acting chops are up there with DeNiro and Pacino.

7359034,5,B012WGY5C8,"This movie is not for the faint hearted, it touches on issues that many
people refuse to accept.

An old school movie directed & made for people who are intellectually
minded. If you are a dullard don't waste your time or money, this Movie
is not for you. This applies to all Reality TV imbeciles.

This movie deserves more recognition, acknowledgements & awards...!

Mickey Rourke is down to earth and delivers a message that Packs a
Punch...!

Plenty of American Gridiron Balls in this Movie...!

I can't wait for the DVD...!

7359039,3,B012WGY5C8,"Stop me if you've heard this one before. A lonely young kid befriends a curmudgeonly neighbor and a bond develops that changes both of their lives. A staple of coming-of-age films about identity and self-worth, it's familiar because...well, it works.  Tony McNamara's slightly offbeat comedy Ashby provides a welcome twist on the formula by adding a touch of hit-man violence and melodrama, but it's neither funny or insightful enough to make a real impression.

Part of the reason Ashby is so forgettable falls on the shoulders of star Nat Wolff, seemingly the new face of every mediocre teen movie around. The Paper Towns, Admission, and Behaving Badly (good lord that one was painful) star plays Ed, a lonely kid who has just moved to a new neighborhood with his mom (Sarah Silverman). She's out there in the dating scene, which makes for a few awkward encounters, while Ed is trying to find out where he fits in at school. An obvious outsider, Ed clicks immediately with fellow misfit Eloise (Emma Roberts), who shares his opinion that ""most people are idiots"".  She's obsessed with concussions and football players' brains, and even has an MRI in her house. He also makes friends with his next door neighbor, a surly, somewhat ragged older gentleman named Ashby (Mickey Rourke). It's all part of an assignment from Ed's snarky teacher to go out and meet someone with greater life experience (read: old), but the two discover they have certain things in common.

For one, both Ed and Ashby are unsure of who they are in the world. It turns out that Ashby has a killer past, literally, as a government assassin-for-hire. Now retired and diagnosed with a terminal illness, he's coming to grips with the terrible things he did and trying to make amends. Ashby's a smart kid but he secretly yearns to be popular, and he quickly recognizes the only way to do that is football, which he happens to be very good at. He's a wuss when it comes to getting hit, but otherwise it moves him up the social ladder while confusing his relationship with Eloise.

Much of the film centers on Ed unwittingly driving Ashby around so he can murder some double-crossing colleagues and the violence are portrayed with a coldness that clashes with the film's generally light tone. While Ed and Ashby's interactions are often bouncy and humorous, Ashby's story is a somber one. The same can be said of Ed's relationship with his estranged father who repeatedly neglects his son's needs. Ashby fills in that paternal void to a degree, teaching the young kid the harsh reality that people will always let you down. It's inevitable.

So there's a lot going on, and McNamara struggles to tie everything up while maintaining the film's generally airy tone.  Ashby's killings are often intercut with scenes of Ed's football prowess or romantic pursuits, creating an odd whiplash emotional effect. Silverman is sorely underused as Ed's needy mom, and that Roberts gets so little screen time when she's at her adorable best is criminal. At this point Rourke naturally exudes world-weariness and it works here as the tortured former killer. Wolff, on the other hand, is always a notch too earnest in every single scene. It's a recurring problem that has the effect of making his performances blend together. Ashby is engaging enough, and features strong performances by Rourke and Roberts, but it's not a film that will linger on the mind for very long.",1443484800,2,3423,4.871134020618556
