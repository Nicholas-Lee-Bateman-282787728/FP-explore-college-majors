3113389,5,B0013K1AK0,This DVD contains all six films. I like the Mr Wong films. They were made between Boris Karloff's Frankenstein Films. The films are for the most part of good quality. The only problem with the DVD is that you have to watch all films at one time. You cannot select individual films.,1231200000,4,281,4.423076923076923

3113391,3,B0013K1AK0,"ALPHA's MR. WONG COMPLETE COLLECTION is six hour-length who-dun-its on a half-dozen individually boxed DVDs. Clearly, one double-sided disc would have sufficed.

In a classic example of miscasting, five installments of this series feature Boris Karloff as a tall, stiff, British-accented James Lee Wong. The sixth film, ""Phantom of Chinatown,"" stars Keye Luke in the role of the Oriental detective.

3113392,2,B0013K1AK0,"Poverty Row's answer to Charlie Chan's entire output is assembled on this cheap DVD.  The picture's themselves are a mixed bag, but given their brevity they're never actually boring.  (The second in the series is easily the best and is a serviceable whodunit.  Like the Chan series Mr. Wong is less interesting when the stories are set in the underworld.)  What's best about the series is Karloff's performance which forgoes racial caricature.  He speaks in his regular voice and it's cultured, unbroken English. I'd like to think his famed courtly manner wouldn't allow for anything else. (Or maybe this is an apology for his earlier Fu Manchu.)

The bargain basement cast and sets are re-used from picture to picture.  Some of the actors are so unstudied that in some scenes they project something approaching naturalism.  Similarly, there are fights that are so under-rehearsed that they come across as unusually realistic and violent for the period.

The really curious entry is the last in the series which stars Keye Luke.  Here we have the novelty of an Asian actor playing an Asian detective -- there's even a hint of romance with an Asian actress!  (And there's a biting and subversive little throw-away line he delivers about raiding the tombs of Chinese antiquity.)  Of course, elsewhere this entry also includes the worst stereotypes of the series.  But there are some location scenes that take the series away from their dreary backlot.",1217289600,12,1449,5.01255230125523

3113395,5,B0013K1AK0,"VCI Entertainment presents ""MR. WONG, DETECTIVE: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION"" (1938-1940) (403 mins)  (In Glorious Black & White/Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- Boris Karloff (born William Henry Pratt) was an English actor who emigrated to Canada in the 1910s --- He is best known for his roles in horror films and his portrayal of Frankenstein's monster in the 1931 film Frankenstein --- His popularity following Frankenstein in the early 1930s was such that for a brief time he was billed simply as ""Karloff"" --- In contrast to the characters he played on screen, Karloff was known in real life as a very kind gentleman who gave generously, especially to children's charities --- Karloff was also a charter member of the Screen Actors Guild, and was especially outspoken regarding working conditions on sets (some extremely hazardous) that actors were expected to deal with in the mid-1930s.

In the next few paragraphs are reviews of Mr. Wong, the detective played to the hilt by Boris Karloff --- 1938-1940 Monogram series with suspenseful whodunit --- ask the question as the ""how"" in each of his cases to be solved --- Although made up to look vaguely Asian, Karloff eschews the stereotypical cadences and one liner sayings of those rival Asian sleuths Mr. Moto and Charlie Chan and is more believable than both detectives --- Karloff as Mr. Wong is still up there with the best of them for mysteries and suspense in the film annuals.

the cast includes:
Boris Karloff ...  Mr. James Lee Wong
 Grant Withers ...  Captain Sam Street
 Maxine Jennings ...  Myra Ross, Dayton's Secretary
 Evelyn Brent ...  Olga Petroff / Countess Dubois / Sophie Dome

""THE MYSTERY OF MR.

MR. WONG IN CHINATOWN"" (1 August 1939) (71 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- Story line and plot, Watch this unfold as pretty Chinese woman, seeking help from San Francisco detective James Lee Wong, is killed by a poisoned dart in his front hall, having time only to scrawl ""Captain J"" on a sheet of paper, what does this mean --- She proves to be Princess Lin Hwa, on a secret military mission for Chinese forces fighting the Japanese invasion --- Can any clue help our master detective as Mr. Wong finds two captains with the initial J in the case, neither being quite what he seems; there's fog on the waterfront and someone still has that poison dart gun --- Karloff held this picture together and has made this film a true Mr. Wong series classic for all Karloff fans.

the cast includes:
Boris Karloff ...  Mr. James Lee Wong

""THE FATAL HOUR"" (15 January 1940) (68 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- Story line and plot, Oriental detective Mr. Wong has successfully solved quite a lot of difficult cases, with his splendid observation talents and marvelous deduction skills --- unequaled master actor Boris Karloff in the role James Lee Wong. Police --- When Captain Street's best friend Dan O'Grady is murdered, Street enlists the help of Chinese detective James Lee Wong. Mr. Wong uncovers a smuggling ring on the waterfront of San Francisco and unmasks the killer, though not until several more murders occur --- where all the smuggling import and export takes place - is the obvious suspect, but there are a lot more people involved --- I liked the realistic aspect that Wong isn't a super hero who prevents further murders from happening and thus has to face several more dead bodies during his investigation --- Karloff is terrific and he receives good feedback from the supportive cast. Particularly Marjorie Reynolds is likable as the obtrusive yet helpful gossip reporter Bobby Logan

 Marjorie Reynolds ...  Roberta 'Bobbie' Logan
 Charles Trowbridge ...  John T. Forbes

""DOOMED TO DIE"" (12 August 1940) (68 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- Story line and plot, Karloff returns once again as the famous Chinese detective James Lee Wong to solve the murder of a shipping tycoon --- As usual what seems like an open and shut case to Capt. Street (Grant Withers) quickly becomes a web of deceit, lies and murder! --- Karloff is, of course, great as Wong. I loved his entrances from the most unlikely places, such as windows or fire escapes --- Thus far, Shipping magnate Cyrus Wentworth, downcast over a disaster to his ocean liner 'Wentworth Castle' (carrying, oddly enough, an illicit shipment of Chinese bonds) is shot in his office --- What has at the very moment of kicking out his daughter's fiance Dick Fleming to do with this case --- Of course, Captain Street arrests Dick, but reporter Bobbie Logan, the attractive thorn in Street's side, is so convinced he's wrong that she enlists the help of detective James Lee Wong to find the real killer --- What unfolds later in the film is quite a mystery in itself.

the cast includes:
Boris Karloff ...  James Lee Wong
 Marjorie Reynolds ...  Roberta 'Bobbie' Logan
 Grant Withers ...  Capt. William 'Bill' Street (Homicide Squad)
 William Stelling ...  Dick Fleming
 Catherine Craig ...  Cynthia Wentworth

Lee Tung Foo also deserves mention in a fun turn as Wong's servant.

the cast includes:
Keye Luke ...  James Lee 'Jimmy' Wong
 Grant Withers ...  Police Captain Street
 Lotus Long ...  Win Lee, Benton's Secretary

Same screenwriter for all three movies. Most of the Wong movies use too much darkness instead of using the classic light and shadow method of creating an atmospheric film. Keye Luke appears in the last Wong movie. He's quite good, but I feel the prevalent racial prejudice of that era precluded Luke from carrying on a series for which he was eminently qualified.",1428969600,,750,4.776923076923077

Boris Karloff stooping to look shorter as well as made up as an Asian character (standard for the time) can be a little odd. The secondary characters detract and distract: the somewhat inadequate police captain spends most of his time shouting at his plucky reporter girlfriend to stay away from the phone.  No doubt it's supposed to be funny, but he ends up just being a jerky gasbag.

I also squirm when racists make rude remarks about Wong; where Chan and Moto get in a few good pot shots at the racists, Wong mostly ignores them. I guess I'd prefer that Wong lob a few insults of his own instead of taking the high road.  If you're interested in this genre and in Karloff, I'd suggest Charlie Chan at the Opera. Karloff stands tall and Chan tosses many pot shots of his own.",1416528000,,845,4.3630573248407645

3113437,4,B0013K1AK0,"Elsewhere, I had read that Karloff's portrayal of Hugh Wiley's James Wong, Detective before I searched for the series.  Most reviews have captured the ""second class"" film technique of the Monogram series, the borrowed sets from other feature films or movie serials and the  perennial low lighting of interior scenes.  Karloff wears a most bizarre make-up that outdoes his ""monster""..  Wong is thoroughly Westernized,right down to his English accent. Conversely,he tolerates actor Li Tong Fu, who plays his servant. Li is the actor who portrayed the ""sing song"" Chinese cook in every movie that cast such a character,

The Wong series is a strange combination of trying to modernize the image of an Asian sleuth yet surrounding him with symbols and sets that more resemble an opium den.

Wong is clever and smart, all right, but Grant Withers over-acting in a supposedly supporting part is a bit annoying.  Debit that to William Nigh who spent most of his career directing Poverty Row whodunnits and by  now was sleepwalking his way through the shooting schedule.  The series is definitely for movie buffs who delight in the obvious plots and perfidy of the suspects.  Despite the many flaws, the price is right to re-live some of the B movies of the thirties (which personally never tire watching).

Actually, seeing Boris Karloff as a Chinese detective is worth the price of admission.",1401494400,,1386,5.008733624454148

3113440,4,B0013K1AK0,"I bought this collection because I saw Boris Karloff as Mr. Wong on one of my Mystery Classics DVDs. I enjoyed him as Wong. The biggest difference between him and other caucasian actors who've played great oriental sleuths is his size. He's quite tall and is usually menacing in appearance and can be quite scary. The reverse is true in these films. Although Mr. Karloff could do nothing about his size, he manages to present a believable representation of an inscrutable oriental sleuth. Of course, by the end of the film, he solves all the questions and twists in the mystery and never breaks his humble and self-deprecating character of Mr. Wong. The supporting cast is delightful and funny. These are family friendly films. They are wonderful on a rainy Sunday afternoon with a bowl of popcorn. Enjoy!",1395705600,,805,4.840579710144928

3113443,5,B0013K1AK0,"Boris Karloff is about as convincing as a Chinese man as I am at passing as white. (I'm African American) If you are going to write a show about a Chinese detective you should at least had hired a Chinese man to portray him. Unfortunately the racism of the times prevented giving real ethnic Chinese an opportunity to portray themselves with passion and sensitivity.  So we are left with Boris Karloff playing a Detective Chinaman with humorous results.

Boris Karloff brings an edge of creepyness to almost every role he portrays as is the case here.  Unfortunately creepy and Chinese culture are vastly different.  Boris Karloff never pulls off his portrayal of a Chinaman.  The actor in the early Charlie Chan movies was the best white guy portraying a Chinese detective and even he was over the top at times.  You could not make a series like this in today's politically correct climate without getting you head handed to you in every way.

So would I recommend buying Mr. Wong Detective - Complete Collection oh heck yeah, I'd buy these again in a heartbeat.  The mystery stories are not half bad. In Mr. Wong Detective - Complete Collection the acting is wooden, the sound is passable, the video quality while not perfect is watchable.  Mr. Wong Detective - Complete Collection is also a very insightful study into the ugliness of uniquely subtle forms of American racism compared to overt forms practiced in World War 2's Germany for example.  You must look at and enjoy these videos as time capsules that let you look backward to see the world as it appeared to sensibilities that are thankfully largely long dead.  The mysteries are great, the acting no so much but they are fun to watch.  There is a film noir nice people behaving badly taint to these films that make them interesting and insightful windows into a bygone era.

His type of detecting is quiet and thoughtful, like Charlie Chan. And like Perry Mason, another series I love. So if you like Charlie Chan and Perry Mason, you'll like these good old 'no blood and guts' mystery stories. I know Charlie Chan films have been criticized because the lead character is not really Chinese. Prob the same criticism might hold true for Mr Karloff, since he looks about as Chinese as the American Flag. Still I find no fault there. These men 'depict' an intelligent witty character who is Chinese. Maybe if remade today, things would be different and the lead character would be Chinese. My point is, that it matters little to me.

3113454,5,B0013K1AK0,"The Mr. Wong films are a great example of the programmer current in the 30s and 40s. They were the preludes to tv series. They were stories of adventures of continuing characters. Mr. Wong is a very good example. karloff plays the chinese detective Mr. Wong (Typical for westerners to be asians in films back then) in the first five films, The movies were made at what was considered poverty row back in those days and to get Karloff was considered quite the deal.
The movies themselves are fine examples of the genre and have the ussual comedy and action while the detective slyly puts it all together and solves the murders. This set is great entertainment when you watch it. It was what would play at the local movies at the time.
Karloff is as always entertaining and the writing is brisk. The films run a little over one hour so the movies move on rapidly. They are fun to watch.
The last movie is Mr. Wong in Phantom of Chinatown. This one has Keye Luke as Mr. Wong and he is the only Asian actor to play the lead in a series programmer that I know of. The story takes place in the early days of Wongs career. These movies are fun and show great skill. They were made on shoestring budgets and the actors who guest starred were probably the best that hollywood never used enough of. i went through the whole series in less than a week and enjoyed all of them.

3113468,5,B0013K1AK0,"When not portraying monsters or scaring us silly with his horror flicks, Boris Karloff (a.k.a. William Henry Pratt) was a gentleman to the core, and this is exactly how he portrays Mr. James Lee Wong, detective.  His character is that of an Oriental gentleman from China, whose skill as a detective ranks right up there with Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto, who were contemporaries of his character.  During the episodes it's not unusual to find him playing ""good cop, bad cop"" with Streeter, the local police high honcho.  Streeter, by the way, is usually the ""bad cop"" in these routines.  He isn't really a bad cop, just a bit overzealous, but he definitely respects Mr. Wong and the work he does to solve whatever case he's handling.
If you want to see the REAL Boris Karloff, just watch these movies.  You'll see a real gentleman in action.  Just remove the Oriental overtones, and you're watching the true Boris Karloff.  I truly think you're going to enjoy these movies if you keep in mind the times in which they were made.  Any way you slice it, this is a five-star collection.",1357862400,,1079,4.6421052631578945

3113472,3,B0013K1AK0,"Monogram's Mr. Wong series may have been very obviously intended to cash in on the success of the Charlie Chan films and a couple would ironically be remade as genuine Charlie Chan film itself less than a decade later, but Boris Karloff's Chinese detective is a very different cup of tea, and not just because his makeup makes him look more Japanese. He's a much more upmarket sleuth, unfailingly polite but not as self-effacing (he's every inch the educated gentleman rather than a humble servant) and able to talk without lapsing into homilies. He's also treated not just as an equal but as a superior, albeit by virtue of his academic qualifications, class, money and inherent good taste.

Being a not quite poverty row production, Mr. Wong, Detective (remade in 1948 as a Charlie Chan film itself, Docks of New Orleans) is a modestly staged affair, but the means by which a group of businessmen (John Hamilton, Perry White from TV's Adventures of Superman among them) are killed is rather neat - especially the trigger mechanism which guarantees the cavalry won't come to your rescue. Being 1938 with the clouds of war drawing closer there's a trio of suspects who represent Germany, Italy and Russia, one of them (Lucien Prival) even looking like a bargain basement Erich Von Stroheim. Bill Nigh's direction makes the most of his modest resources, establishing the template for the chalk-and-cheese but mutually respectful relationship between Grant Withers' brash Detective Street (not yet saddled with Marjorie Reynolds' regular go-getting reporter girlfriend) and Karloff's soft-spoken, patient Wong that would be the backbone of the series.

The Mystery of Mr. Wong starts off as something of an improvement, establishing the rich murder victim's bona fides as a nasty piece of work before a game of homicidal charades at a party for the great and good, Mr Wong among them, turns into the real thing. When the assembled guests realise that the victim isn't that good an actor it settles down into a decent but unexceptional house of suspects number, with the murderer increasingly obvious despite most of the clues and the motive being withheld from the audience until the last reel. A remake of 1931's Murder at Midnight, there are hints of The Moonstone along the way, with the victim recently having smuggled into a fabulous but cursed sapphire from China, but hints of the supernatural or the Yellow Peril are kept firmly in the background as Wong and fellow criminologist Holmes Herbert try to sift the red herrings from their haul of well-motivated suspects without ever doing anything too expensive along the way.

The production values went up a bit - at least by Monogram's standards - for third entry Mr. Wong in Chinatown, with the sophisticated sleuth finding a potential client murdered in his own house before he even gets a chance to greet her. The victim was a Chinese princess on a secret mission to buy warplanes and smuggle them out of America in a plot involving dwarfs, exploding taxis, sleeve guns, fistfights, forged cheques and a large sum of missing money, and as usual Grant Withers' Detective Street is waiting in his office for another phone call to summon him to view the latest body - that is, when he's not fighting with another female reporter he's dating (Marjorie Reynolds this time in her first of three Wong films). Later remade in 1947 as The Chinese Ring, part of Monogram's Charlie Chan series, there's a lot more action this time round and things move along a lot more briskly.

The Fatal Hour (aka Mr. Wong at Headquarters) sees Wong and Street on the trail of the man who murdered one of their friends who, conveniently, was investigating smuggling treasures from the Orient into America, with the trail leading from upmarket imitation jewellery shops to a shady waterfront nightclub. Naturally `the Chinese copper' solves the mystery with the aid of an advanced remote control radio in the kind of film that's as professionally unexceptional as you'd expect from a film designed primarily to offer movie theatres a cheaper alternative to that season's Charlie Chan movie. Unfortunately the print quality on this title in the VCI collection is pretty poor, with one reel fairly bleached out before improving slightly for the rest of the film.

Doomed to Die is certainly the most tired and visibly cut-rate entry in the series - not only does this again use chunks of footage from The Fatal Hour but lifts a whole sequence from Mr Wong in Chinatown with new close-ups so incredibly clumsily that Richard Loo turns into considerably older Moy Ming - complete with entirely different facial hair - and then back again! It's a pretty tedious locked room mystery that struggles to pad out its running time, with Karloff and company going through it with all the enthusiasm of an unwanted contractual obligation. Still, there's a memorably obnoxious cocky chauffeur among the suspects (""We're both the same type. You write lies and I tell them"") and some familiar faces in the supporting cast, including a surprisingly artificial Henry Brandon (Scar from The Searchers and Silas Barnaby from Laurel and Hardy's Babes in Toyland), Paul Kelly in a rare non-creepy guy role and an uncredited Gibson Gowland, once the star of Von Stroheim's Greed, as a doctor.

Phantom of Chinatown gets a surprising shot in the arm from the departure of Boris Karloff and director Bill Nigh (here replaced by Phil Rosen), with the team working off the star's Monogram contract with The Ape and the studio suddenly left with a contractual obligation to deliver a sixth film. The solution was revolutionary in more ways than one - casting a younger actor of Chinese descent in the role of a Chinese detective and making the film a prequel. Keye Luke's a more energetic figure blessed with a lot more personality than Karloff and his presence helps turn some of the clich&eacute;s around, the film going out of its way to puncture stereotypes - in a lecture academics laughing at footage of a Chinese dance are rebuked with the reminder that China was civilised long before the west, Detective Street's belief that a Chinese woman eats chop suey for lunch proves spectacularly wide of the mark - she prefers apple pie and coffee - while Wong gets to deliver a real humdinger when a condescending butler points out the sarcophagus of a Ming Dynasty emperor: ""They tell me that a Chinese archaeological expedition is digging up the body of George Washington in exchange. Well, it gives you a rough idea."" Even the genre conventions take the odd jab, with Wong pointedly dismissing one suspect because in these kind of stories the most suspicious character is never the guilty party.

The budget is still visibly low - you'll still see a lot of the same sets from the earlier films, barely redressed in some cases - and it's still not a great picture, but it's a zippy little programmer that's good enough to make you regret the studio not deciding to carry on the series in a similar vein and least ensures that things go out on a high.

VCI's NTSC collection of all six films isn't quite the best transfer on the market - MGM have released manufactured-on-demand DVD-Rs of the first few films that are apparently superior quality - but it's certainly the best of the many public domain versions available on the market, and even comes with a few extras: stills gallery, vintage Max Fleischer cartoons cartoons Date to Skate and King for a Day, the first chapter of vintage serial Red Barry and trailers for Karloff films Frankenstein, The Mummy, Bride of Frankenstein and House of Frankenstein.",1345507200,12,7617,4.894655305964369

3113494,4,B0013K1AK0,"When Warner Oland's run as Charlie Chan ended in 1938, the race was on for a new chinese detective.  The first entries were Charlie Chan in Honolulu (Sidney Toler) and Mr. Wong Detective (Boris Karloff.)  The Chan movies continued on, while the Wong movies sputtered out.

Who is Mr. Wong?  He is strictly a local detective, never straying far from Chinatown.  He is a gentleman, who speaks softly and is clearly amused by the bark and bluster of the other characters.  With his expertise in arcane subjects and ties to a Chinese tong, he aids Captain Street in solving all crimes chinese.

Captain Street is big, tall, and domineering.  He impatiently draws conclusions, and in some cases, before he examines the murder scene!  He is brash, boorish, loud, insulting, and of course, he has women problems.  In the first film he has a girl friend, just barely; in the second he has none; and in the third he begins dating Bobby Logan.

Bobby, a newspaper reporter, is always nosing around the station looking for a scoop. Unbelievably, this sexy, vivacious, spunky reporter is hot for this big lug.  It is fun to watch their tiffs and antics.  By the fifth film, Street's incessant rudeness wears thin, and when he violates her feather, well, that was probably the last straw, because by the sixth film she is gone.

These are good films, except the last one, in which Keye Luke gives a tepid performance as Wong.

A reprieve: The script for Mr. Wong in Chinatown was later reused in The Chinese Ring, a Charlie Chan (Roland Winters) film.  Watching these side-by-side, it is obvious that Wong wins one after all!

Picture is usually good, sometimes grainy, but overall watchable.  Sound is good, but occasional faint thumping in last film.",1255824000,8,1739,4.778523489932886

3347889,2,B0013K1AK0,"Poverty Row's answer to Charlie Chan's entire output is assembled on this cheap DVD.  The picture's themselves are a mixed bag, but given their brevity they're never actually boring.  (The second in the series is easily the best and is a serviceable whodunit.  Like the Chan series Mr. Wong is less interesting when the stories are set in the underworld.)  What's best about the series is Karloff's performance which forgoes racial caricature.  He speaks in his regular voice and it's cultured, unbroken English. I'd like to think his famed courtly manner wouldn't allow for anything else. (Or maybe this is an apology for his earlier Fu Manchu.)

The bargain basement cast and sets are re-used from picture to picture.  Some of the actors are so unstudied that in some scenes they project something approaching naturalism.  Similarly, there are fights that are so under-rehearsed that they come across as unusually realistic and violent for the period.

The really curious entry is the last in the series which stars Keye Luke.  Here we have the novelty of an Asian actor playing an Asian detective -- there's even a hint of romance with an Asian actress!  (And there's a biting and subversive little throw-away line he delivers about raiding the tombs of Chinese antiquity.)

WONG, DETECTIVE: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION"" (1938-1940) (403 mins)  (In Glorious Black & White/Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- Boris Karloff (born William Henry Pratt) was an English actor who emigrated to Canada in the 1910s --- He is best known for his roles in horror films and his portrayal of Frankenstein's monster in the 1931 film Frankenstein --- His popularity following Frankenstein in the early 1930s was such that for a brief time he was billed simply as ""Karloff"" --- In contrast to the characters he played on screen, Karloff was known in real life as a very kind gentleman who gave generously, especially to children's charities --- Karloff was also a charter member of the Screen Actors Guild, and was especially outspoken regarding working conditions on sets (some extremely hazardous) that actors were expected to deal with in the mid-1930s.

In the next few paragraphs are reviews of Mr. Wong, the detective played to the hilt by Boris Karloff --- 1938-1940 Monogram series with suspenseful whodunit --- ask the question as the ""how"" in each of his cases to be solved --- Although made up to look vaguely Asian, Karloff eschews the stereotypical cadences and one liner sayings of those rival Asian sleuths Mr. Moto and Charlie Chan and is more believable than both detectives --- Karloff as Mr. Wong is still up there with the best of them for mysteries and suspense in the film annuals.

the cast includes:
Boris Karloff ...  Mr. James Lee Wong
 Grant Withers ...  Captain Sam Street
 Maxine Jennings ...  Myra Ross, Dayton's Secretary

MR. WONG IN CHINATOWN"" (1 August 1939) (71 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- Story line and plot, Watch this unfold as pretty Chinese woman, seeking help from San Francisco detective James Lee Wong, is killed by a poisoned dart in his front hall, having time only to scrawl ""Captain J"" on a sheet of paper, what does this mean --- She proves to be Princess Lin Hwa, on a secret military mission for Chinese forces fighting the Japanese invasion --- Can any clue help our master detective as Mr. Wong finds two captains with the initial J in the case, neither being quite what he seems; there's fog on the waterfront and someone still has that poison dart gun --- Karloff held this picture together and has made this film a true Mr. Wong series classic for all Karloff fans.

the cast includes:
Boris Karloff ...  Mr. James Lee Wong
 Marjorie Reynolds ...  Roberta 'Bobbie' Logan (reporter)
 Grant Withers ...  Police Capt. Bill Street
 Huntley Gordon ...  Mr. Davidson (bank president)

""THE FATAL HOUR"" (15 January 1940) (68 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- Story line and plot, Oriental detective Mr. Wong has successfully solved quite a lot of difficult cases, with his splendid observation talents and marvelous deduction skills --- unequaled master actor Boris Karloff in the role James Lee Wong. Police --- When Captain Street's best friend Dan O'Grady is murdered, Street enlists the help of Chinese detective James Lee Wong. Mr. Wong uncovers a smuggling ring on the waterfront of San Francisco and unmasks the killer, though not until several more murders occur --- where all the smuggling import and export takes place - is the obvious suspect, but there are a lot more people involved --- I liked the realistic aspect that Wong isn't a super hero who prevents further murders from happening and thus has to face several more dead bodies during his investigation --- Karloff is terrific and he receives good feedback from the supportive cast. Particularly Marjorie Reynolds is likable as the obtrusive yet helpful gossip reporter Bobby Logan

 Marjorie Reynolds ...  Roberta 'Bobbie' Logan
 Charles Trowbridge ...  John T. Forbes

Street (Grant Withers) quickly becomes a web of deceit, lies and murder! --- Karloff is, of course, great as Wong. I loved his entrances from the most unlikely places, such as windows or fire escapes --- Thus far, Shipping magnate Cyrus Wentworth, downcast over a disaster to his ocean liner 'Wentworth Castle' (carrying, oddly enough, an illicit shipment of Chinese bonds) is shot in his office --- What has at the very moment of kicking out his daughter's fiance Dick Fleming to do with this case --- Of course, Captain Street arrests Dick, but reporter Bobbie Logan, the attractive thorn in Street's side, is so convinced he's wrong that she enlists the help of detective James Lee Wong to find the real killer --- What unfolds later in the film is quite a mystery in itself.

the cast includes:
Boris Karloff ...  James Lee Wong
 Marjorie Reynolds ...  Roberta 'Bobbie' Logan
 Grant Withers ...  Capt. William 'Bill' Street (Homicide Squad)
 William Stelling ...  Dick Fleming
 Catherine Craig ...  Cynthia Wentworth
 Guy Usher ...  Paul Fleming (Dick's father)
 Henry Brandon ...  Victor 'Vic' Martin (attorney)

Lee Tung Foo also deserves mention in a fun turn as Wong's servant.

the cast includes:
Keye Luke ...  James Lee 'Jimmy' Wong
 Grant Withers ...  Police Captain Street
 Lotus Long ...  Win Lee, Benton's Secretary

3347917,4,B0013K1AK0,"Pretty good classic detective movies with the inimitable Boris Karloff as James Lee Wong (character derived from a series of magazine stories from the 1930's) One clever method of disposing of a person showed up first in a Mr. Wong movie, then repeated two years later in a Charlie Chan film titled MURDER OVER NEW YORK, then repeated again with a slight revision in another Chan movie. Same screenwriter for all three movies. Most of the Wong movies use too much darkness instead of using the classic light and shadow method of creating an atmospheric film. Keye Luke appears in the last Wong movie. He's quite good, but I feel the prevalent racial prejudice of that era precluded Luke from carrying on a series for which he was eminently qualified.",1428969600,,750,4.776923076923077

3347926,3,B0013K1AK0,"These are all right, but not as good as Charlie Chan or Mr. Moto.  Boris Karloff stooping to look shorter as well as made up as an Asian character (standard for the time) can be a little odd. The secondary characters detract and distract: the somewhat inadequate police captain spends most of his time shouting at his plucky reporter girlfriend to stay away from the phone.  No doubt it's supposed to be funny, but he ends up just being a jerky gasbag.

I also squirm when racists make rude remarks about Wong; where Chan and Moto get in a few good pot shots at the racists, Wong mostly ignores them. I guess I'd prefer that Wong lob a few insults of his own instead of taking the high road.  If you're interested in this genre and in Karloff, I'd suggest Charlie Chan at the Opera. Karloff stands tall and Chan tosses many pot shots of his own.",1416528000,,845,4.3630573248407645

3347933,4,B0013K1AK0,I really enjoyed these films.  Of course Boris Karloff as a Chinese detective is quite the stretch.  It seems wrong on so many levels.  But if you can put that fat aside the films look and sound good.  Just goo old fashion fun.  Wish they made more.,1403827200,,249,4.212765957446808
3347934,4,B0013K1AK0,"Elsewhere, I had read that Karloff's portrayal of Hugh Wiley's James Wong, Detective before I searched for the series.  Most reviews have captured the ""second class"" film technique of the Monogram series, the borrowed sets from other feature films or movie serials and the  perennial low lighting of interior scenes.  Karloff wears a most bizarre make-up that outdoes his ""monster""..  Wong is thoroughly Westernized,right down to his English accent. Conversely,he tolerates actor Li Tong Fu, who plays his servant. Li is the actor who portrayed the ""sing song"" Chinese cook in every movie that cast such a character,

The Wong series is a strange combination of trying to modernize the image of an Asian sleuth yet surrounding him with symbols and sets that more resemble an opium den.

Wong is clever and smart, all right, but Grant Withers over-acting in a supposedly supporting part is a bit annoying.  Debit that to William Nigh who spent most of his career directing Poverty Row whodunnits and by  now was sleepwalking his way through the shooting schedule.  The series is definitely for movie buffs who delight in the obvious plots and perfidy of the suspects.  Despite the many flaws, the price is right to re-live some of the B movies of the thirties (which personally never tire watching).

Actually, seeing Boris Karloff as a Chinese detective is worth the price of admission.",1401494400,,1386,5.008733624454148
3347935,5,B0013K1AK0,This is good for what it is.  I enjoy early 1900 mysteries and plan on collecting as many as I can.  Nice not to have the wits scared out of you like modern-day movies can do.,1399248000,,175,3.8333333333333335
3347936,5,B0013K1AK0,"That of being a Chinese detective. These films are old but nothing but great stories, wonderful acting. Either you like this era of movies, I do. I hope you do as well!",1397952000,5,168,4.28125
3347937,4,B0013K1AK0,"I bought this collection because I saw Boris Karloff as Mr. Wong on one of my Mystery Classics DVDs. I enjoyed him as Wong. The biggest difference between him and other caucasian actors who've played great oriental sleuths is his size. He's quite tall and is usually menacing in appearance and can be quite scary. The reverse is true in these films. Although Mr. Karloff could do nothing about his size, he manages to present a believable representation of an inscrutable oriental sleuth. Of course, by the end of the film, he solves all the questions and twists in the mystery and never breaks his humble and self-deprecating character of Mr. Wong. The supporting cast is delightful and funny. These are family friendly films. They are wonderful on a rainy Sunday afternoon with a bowl of popcorn. Enjoy!",1395705600,,805,4.840579710144928
3347938,3,B0013K1AK0,"Was not what I expected.....

3347939,5,B0013K1AK0,"This collection of Mr. Wong movies is very good for both picture and sound quality.  One movie in the set stars Key Luke as Mr. Wong, who also played in some of the Charlie Chan movies as his son.  If you like old movies, this is a good set.",1391212800,,241,3.8979591836734695
3347940,5,B0013K1AK0,"Boris Karloff is about as convincing as a Chinese man as I am at passing as white. (I'm African American) If you are going to write a show about a Chinese detective you should at least had hired a Chinese man to portray him. Unfortunately the racism of the times prevented giving real ethnic Chinese an opportunity to portray themselves with passion and sensitivity.  So we are left with Boris Karloff playing a Detective Chinaman with humorous results.

Boris Karloff brings an edge of creepyness to almost every role he portrays as is the case here.  Unfortunately creepy and Chinese culture are vastly different.  Boris Karloff never pulls off his portrayal of a Chinaman.  The actor in the early Charlie Chan movies was the best white guy portraying a Chinese detective and even he was over the top at times.  You could not make a series like this in today's politically correct climate without getting you head handed to you in every way.

So would I recommend buying Mr. Wong Detective - Complete Collection oh heck yeah, I'd buy these again in a heartbeat.  The mystery stories are not half bad. In Mr. Wong Detective - Complete Collection the acting is wooden, the sound is passable, the video quality while not perfect is watchable.  Mr. Wong Detective - Complete Collection is also a very insightful study into the ugliness of uniquely subtle forms of American racism compared to overt forms practiced in World War 2's Germany for example.  You must look at and enjoy these videos as time capsules that let you look backward to see the world as it appeared to sensibilities that are thankfully largely long dead.  The mysteries are great, the acting no so much but they are fun to watch.  There is a film noir nice people behaving badly taint to these films that make them interesting and insightful windows into a bygone era. I'd buy Mr. Wong Detective - Complete Collection again in a New York minute.",1385337600,3,1913,4.728915662650603

3347942,5,B0013K1AK0,"I am a Charlie Chan fan, but needed more of the same for a change of pace. I found these stories starring Boris Karloff and was pleasantly surprised. His type of detecting is quiet and thoughtful, like Charlie Chan. And like Perry Mason, another series I love. So if you like Charlie Chan and Perry Mason, you'll like these good old 'no blood and guts' mystery stories. I know Charlie Chan films have been criticized because the lead character is not really Chinese. Prob the same criticism might hold true for Mr Karloff, since he looks about as Chinese as the American Flag. Still I find no fault there. These men 'depict' an intelligent witty character who is Chinese. Maybe if remade today, things would be different and the lead character would be Chinese. My point is, that it matters little to me. I just enjoy the good mysteries.",1384300800,,837,4.624161073825503

3347951,5,B0013K1AK0,"The Mr. Wong films are a great example of the programmer current in the 30s and 40s. They were the preludes to tv series. They were stories of adventures of continuing characters. Mr. Wong is a very good example. karloff plays the chinese detective Mr. Wong (Typical for westerners to be asians in films back then) in the first five films, The movies were made at what was considered poverty row back in those days and to get Karloff was considered quite the deal.
The movies themselves are fine examples of the genre and have the ussual comedy and action while the detective slyly puts it all together and solves the murders. This set is great entertainment when you watch it. It was what would play at the local movies at the time.
Karloff is as always entertaining and the writing is brisk. The films run a little over one hour so the movies move on rapidly. They are fun to watch.
The last movie is Mr. Wong in Phantom of Chinatown. This one has Keye Luke as Mr. Wong and he is the only Asian actor to play the lead in a series programmer that I know of. The story takes place in the early days of Wongs career. These movies are fun and show great skill. They were made on shoestring budgets and the actors who guest starred were probably the best that hollywood never used enough of. i went through the whole series in less than a week and enjoyed all of them.
VCI did a good job with the transfers and also fun extras.

3347965,5,B0013K1AK0,"When not portraying monsters or scaring us silly with his horror flicks, Boris Karloff (a.k.a. William Henry Pratt) was a gentleman to the core, and this is exactly how he portrays Mr. James Lee Wong, detective.  His character is that of an Oriental gentleman from China, whose skill as a detective ranks right up there with Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto, who were contemporaries of his character.  During the episodes it's not unusual to find him playing ""good cop, bad cop"" with Streeter, the local police high honcho.  Streeter, by the way, is usually the ""bad cop"" in these routines.  He isn't really a bad cop, just a bit overzealous, but he definitely respects Mr. Wong and the work he does to solve whatever case he's handling.
If you want to see the REAL Boris Karloff, just watch these movies.  You'll see a real gentleman in action.  Just remove the Oriental overtones, and you're watching the true Boris Karloff.  I truly think you're going to enjoy these movies if you keep in mind the times in which they were made.  Any way you slice it, this is a five-star collection.",1357862400,,1079,4.6421052631578945

3347969,3,B0013K1AK0,"Monogram's Mr. Wong series may have been very obviously intended to cash in on the success of the Charlie Chan films and a couple would ironically be remade as genuine Charlie Chan film itself less than a decade later, but Boris Karloff's Chinese detective is a very different cup of tea, and not just because his makeup makes him look more Japanese. He's a much more upmarket sleuth, unfailingly polite but not as self-effacing (he's every inch the educated gentleman rather than a humble servant) and able to talk without lapsing into homilies. He's also treated not just as an equal but as a superior, albeit by virtue of his academic qualifications, class, money and inherent good taste.

Being a not quite poverty row production, Mr. Wong, Detective (remade in 1948 as a Charlie Chan film itself, Docks of New Orleans) is a modestly staged affair, but the means by which a group of businessmen (John Hamilton, Perry White from TV's Adventures of Superman among them) are killed is rather neat - especially the trigger mechanism which guarantees the cavalry won't come to your rescue. Being 1938 with the clouds of war drawing closer there's a trio of suspects who represent Germany, Italy and Russia, one of them (Lucien Prival) even looking like a bargain basement Erich Von Stroheim. Bill Nigh's direction makes the most of his modest resources, establishing the template for the chalk-and-cheese but mutually respectful relationship between Grant Withers' brash Detective Street (not yet saddled with Marjorie Reynolds' regular go-getting reporter girlfriend) and Karloff's soft-spoken, patient Wong that would be the backbone of the series.

The Mystery of Mr. Wong starts off as something of an improvement, establishing the rich murder victim's bona fides as a nasty piece of work before a game of homicidal charades at a party for the great and good, Mr Wong among them, turns into the real thing. When the assembled guests realise that the victim isn't that good an actor it settles down into a decent but unexceptional house of suspects number, with the murderer increasingly obvious despite most of the clues and the motive being withheld from the audience until the last reel. A remake of 1931's Murder at Midnight, there are hints of The Moonstone along the way, with the victim recently having smuggled into a fabulous but cursed sapphire from China, but hints of the supernatural or the Yellow Peril are kept firmly in the background as Wong and fellow criminologist Holmes Herbert try to sift the red herrings from their haul of well-motivated suspects without ever doing anything too expensive along the way.

The production values went up a bit - at least by Monogram's standards - for third entry Mr. Wong in Chinatown, with the sophisticated sleuth finding a potential client murdered in his own house before he even gets a chance to greet her. The victim was a Chinese princess on a secret mission to buy warplanes and smuggle them out of America in a plot involving dwarfs, exploding taxis, sleeve guns, fistfights, forged cheques and a large sum of missing money, and as usual Grant Withers' Detective Street is waiting in his office for another phone call to summon him to view the latest body - that is, when he's not fighting with another female reporter he's dating (Marjorie Reynolds this time in her first of three Wong films). Later remade in 1947 as The Chinese Ring, part of Monogram's Charlie Chan series, there's a lot more action this time round and things move along a lot more briskly.

The Fatal Hour (aka Mr. Wong at Headquarters) sees Wong and Street on the trail of the man who murdered one of their friends who, conveniently, was investigating smuggling treasures from the Orient into America, with the trail leading from upmarket imitation jewellery shops to a shady waterfront nightclub. Naturally `the Chinese copper' solves the mystery with the aid of an advanced remote control radio in the kind of film that's as professionally unexceptional as you'd expect from a film designed primarily to offer movie theatres a cheaper alternative to that season's Charlie Chan movie. Unfortunately the print quality on this title in the VCI collection is pretty poor, with one reel fairly bleached out before improving slightly for the rest of the film.

Doomed to Die is certainly the most tired and visibly cut-rate entry in the series - not only does this again use chunks of footage from The Fatal Hour but lifts a whole sequence from Mr Wong in Chinatown with new close-ups so incredibly clumsily that Richard Loo turns into considerably older Moy Ming - complete with entirely different facial hair - and then back again! It's a pretty tedious locked room mystery that struggles to pad out its running time, with Karloff and company going through it with all the enthusiasm of an unwanted contractual obligation. Still, there's a memorably obnoxious cocky chauffeur among the suspects (""We're both the same type. You write lies and I tell them"") and some familiar faces in the supporting cast, including a surprisingly artificial Henry Brandon (Scar from The Searchers and Silas Barnaby from Laurel and Hardy's Babes in Toyland), Paul Kelly in a rare non-creepy guy role and an uncredited Gibson Gowland, once the star of Von Stroheim's Greed, as a doctor.

Phantom of Chinatown gets a surprising shot in the arm from the departure of Boris Karloff and director Bill Nigh (here replaced by Phil Rosen), with the team working off the star's Monogram contract with The Ape and the studio suddenly left with a contractual obligation to deliver a sixth film. The solution was revolutionary in more ways than one - casting a younger actor of Chinese descent in the role of a Chinese detective and making the film a prequel. Keye Luke's a more energetic figure blessed with a lot more personality than Karloff and his presence helps turn some of the clich&eacute;s around, the film going out of its way to puncture stereotypes - in a lecture academics laughing at footage of a Chinese dance are rebuked with the reminder that China was civilised long before the west, Detective Street's belief that a Chinese woman eats chop suey for lunch proves spectacularly wide of the mark - she prefers apple pie and coffee - while Wong gets to deliver a real humdinger when a condescending butler points out the sarcophagus of a Ming Dynasty emperor: ""They tell me that a Chinese archaeological expedition is digging up the body of George Washington in exchange. Well, it gives you a rough idea."" Even the genre conventions take the odd jab, with Wong pointedly dismissing one suspect because in these kind of stories the most suspicious character is never the guilty party.

The budget is still visibly low - you'll still see a lot of the same sets from the earlier films, barely redressed in some cases - and it's still not a great picture, but it's a zippy little programmer that's good enough to make you regret the studio not deciding to carry on the series in a similar vein and least ensures that things go out on a high.

VCI's NTSC collection of all six films isn't quite the best transfer on the market - MGM have released manufactured-on-demand DVD-Rs of the first few films that are apparently superior quality - but it's certainly the best of the many public domain versions available on the market, and even comes with a few extras: stills gallery, vintage Max Fleischer cartoons cartoons Date to Skate and King for a Day, the first chapter of vintage serial Red Barry and trailers for Karloff films Frankenstein, The Mummy, Bride of Frankenstein and House of Frankenstein.",1345507200,12,7617,4.894655305964369

3347991,4,B0013K1AK0,"When Warner Oland's run as Charlie Chan ended in 1938, the race was on for a new chinese detective.  The first entries were Charlie Chan in Honolulu (Sidney Toler) and Mr. Wong Detective (Boris Karloff.)  The Chan movies continued on, while the Wong movies sputtered out.

Who is Mr. Wong?  He is strictly a local detective, never straying far from Chinatown.  He is a gentleman, who speaks softly and is clearly amused by the bark and bluster of the other characters.  With his expertise in arcane subjects and ties to a Chinese tong, he aids Captain Street in solving all crimes chinese.

Captain Street is big, tall, and domineering.  He impatiently draws conclusions, and in some cases, before he examines the murder scene!  He is brash, boorish, loud, insulting, and of course, he has women problems.  In the first film he has a girl friend, just barely; in the second he has none; and in the third he begins dating Bobby Logan.

Bobby, a newspaper reporter, is always nosing around the station looking for a scoop. Unbelievably, this sexy, vivacious, spunky reporter is hot for this big lug.  It is fun to watch their tiffs and antics.  By the fifth film, Street's incessant rudeness wears thin, and when he violates her feather, well, that was probably the last straw, because by the sixth film she is gone.

These are good films, except the last one, in which Keye Luke gives a tepid performance as Wong.

A reprieve: The script for Mr. Wong in Chinatown was later reused in The Chinese Ring, a Charlie Chan (Roland Winters) film.  Watching these side-by-side, it is obvious that Wong wins one after all!

Picture is usually good, sometimes grainy, but overall watchable.  Sound is good, but occasional faint thumping in last film.",1255824000,8,1739,4.778523489932886
