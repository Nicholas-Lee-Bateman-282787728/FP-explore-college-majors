8489131,5,B005Y6A10Y,"I had used only the most basic of stitches on my old serger because the thread would break and it was a real bear to thread again. So I tried to take no chances, Now I have a new serger with easy threading, and I realized that I don't know a fourth of the things I could do with it.
