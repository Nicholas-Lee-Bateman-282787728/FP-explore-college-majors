8088090,4,B000BKQ1ES,"This 2004 production covers the search and salvage of the SS Republic side-wheeler, formerly CSS Tennessee and USS Mobile.  After a long search, the first signs of the gold and silver coins are discovered on the first test of the suction equipment near the rudder.  What are the odds!  The loss of the ship is re-enacted.

A bonus 2001 segment, Inside The Hunley, of about 11 minutes, focuses on the wet tank and conservation methods, and the initial opening and excavation of the sub's silt filled interior.",1375660800,2,508,4.804597701149425
8088091,4,B000BKQ1ES,"In 1865, a ship carrying about 90 people and lots of gold sunk.  This work concerns trying to find and re-capture those objects.
For those not interested in marine engineering, there's a human aspect.  This mentions the lives of two men, one white and the other Black, who were on the ship and why.  I'm from the Chicagoland area and this work explains how Maywood, IL got its name.  They pull artefacts, like food and writing utensils, that point to the lives of those on board.  They show a 5th-generation ancestor of one of the men on board looking at these items.
They find the gold half way through the work.  I'm a big believer in not letting money go to waste, so I'm glad they met their mission.  They found about 54 million dollars in coins.  I hope they put it to good use.
There is an emphasis on the challenges of this pursuit.  Things cost 25,000$ per day to conduct.  At one point, their ""Snoop Dog"" (I get that term from the film ""Titanic"") malfunctions.  It shows that 100 plus years later, we are not immune to accidents at sea.
Speaking of Titanic, when I think of shipwrecks, I think of tragedy and most folk dying.  Here, they said 2/3 of the people survived.  The passengers were set adrift for five days.  Luckily, this doesn't focus too much on their starving and not being able to drink the salt water surrounding them, etc.
Near the end, they show an actual rainbow about the waters.  I think that was a scenic way to express ""mission accomplished""!",1313020800,2,1474,4.468164794007491
