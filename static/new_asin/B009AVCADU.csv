Penguin Drum, like Utena, is a roller-coaster of emotion and drama. You can see from the very first episode that much thought and care was given not only to the look, but the feel of the anime. I won't spoil, but this is something worth watching if you're looking for an experience that makes you think twice as you watch.",1357257600,,384,4.565217391304348
5309720,5,B009AVCADU,"Mawaru Penguindrum may not be my personal favorite anime, but it is easily the best one I have ever seen.  This stopped being an anime about half-way through, and became pure art.  With writing and characterization on par with Conrad and Milton, this series explores the idea of fate, and is a beautiful, one of a kind, masterpiece.  The show is almost entirely philosophical, and warrants several watchings, if only to comprehend the entirety of this masterpiece.

All in all, I cannot recommend this series highly enough, especially to literature students like myself.  People will appreciate the attention to detail, the fantastic animation quality, and the exploration of the mind.  Definitely pick this up in as high quality as you can.",1357084800,2,741,5.082644628099174
5309721,5,B009AVCADU,"Wow.  I was blown away by this anime.  After watching the trailer, it caught my eye enough to purchase Collection 1 and give the show a watch-through -- wasn't so sure about those 'penguins'.  I'm extremely happy I gave the anime a chance and greatly looking forward to Collection 2 -- just watching those 'penguins' in the background of the show just adds the right amount of humour to this masterpiece.  I enjoy the slightly, off-kilter type of anime, not too bizarre-esque, but artistically challenging.  I enjoy subtitles and the original Japanese language track, so cannot speak for any voice acting.

I won't go into detail about the storyline, which is very good, since other reviewers have, but will shortly explain, studio-wise, why I like this production.  I can become addicted to certain anime studios ... Brain's Base caught my attention with Baccano! and Durarara!!, and I'm very much looking foward to future releases by this studio.  'Pengiundrum' adds the quirkiness of studio Shaft's works of art (Hidamari Sketch, Bakemonogatari, Puella Mag Madoka Magica, Maria Holic, Pani Poni Dash and Negima!?), which to me is pure genius and brilliance -- it's that ""full attention"" the artwork anime demands ... and also reminds of the the brightly colourful, fluid animation of studio Kyoto Animation's newer work (The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya, K-on!, Lucky Star, et cetera).

I watched all 12 episodes in 2 days.  It's attention-grabbing and beautiful to watch.",1356739200,3,1476,5.138075313807532
5309722,5,B009AVCADU,"Mawaru Penguindrum is a difficult anime to define...  As another reviewer said it is art in the truest sense of the word.  If you want mindless entertainment, look elsewhere.  If you want something playing on the TV in the background while you are doing something else, look elsewhere.  It is a series that requires and deserves your full attention.  It is highly psychological and highly philosophical.  If you don't care for analyzing literature or peering into the darkness of the human heart, then you probably won't enjoy Penguindrum.

That disclaimer out of the way, Mawaru Penguindrum is a philosophical masterpiece.  The main topic is free-will vs destiny.  There is also quite a bit of time spent on perception vs reality, and the meaning and nature of family.  But to me the topic that distinguishes the series is the role of others in self-definition and self-worth...  Namely, that an individual is defined by their contrast with others, and no individual can continue to value himself unless he is also loved by another.

Let me give two examples...  The first is the animation of the background characters.  Background characters such as random people walking on the street are depicted as white blob-figures--like what you would see on a public restroom door.  At first I thought this was evidence of a low budget, but as I began to understand the series I realized that it emphasizes the main point.  A person does not become truly human in the eye of the observer until the observer knows something about them.  The background characters have no individuality, no motion, they are nothing but blank scenery.  Since we know nothing about these characters, they cannot become truly human in our minds, and the series emphasizes this point by depicting them with no individuality.

The second example is a mild spoiler, so be warned...  One of the most poignant aspects of the society in Penguindrum is an institution called the ""child-grinder.""  Any unwanted child is sent to the grinder, where they are ripped to shreds and then reassembled into ""invisible people.""  The thesis is that to be unloved is to be unappreciated for your individuality.  If these unloved children are reassembled into generic people with no individuality at all, then they will have no reason to feel pain when they are unnoticed by others.  It is frighteningly symbolic of our public education system, where in the name of ""equal opportunity"" or ""no child left behind"" our society has taken pains to ensure everyone gets out of school with exactly the same skill set...  There is little acknowledgement of individual ability and aptitude.  Through standardized testing and curriculum, we ensure our children enter society as generic.

As one last disclaimer, let me add that as in many psychological studies, there is quite a bit of sexual content in Penguindrum, and some of it is homosexual.

If you are looking for simple entertainment, Penguindrum is not for you.  If you want believe that man is basically good, you will probably be offended by the series.  But if you are open to gazing into the darkness of the human heart and the darkness of human society, Penguindrum is an excellent case-study.",1350691200,52,3198,4.967984934086629
5309723,5,B009AVCADU,"...it'd turn out something like Penguin Drum.  First and foremost, this review is based off the original Japanese broadcasts.  I haven't seen the English Dub and I don't plan to buy it.  Now, since I put that out there at the very beginning, you must think I hate the anime.  This is absolutely not true.  I loved it, but at the same time I can't stand it.  Penguin Drum is like a drug, a guilty pleasure, the beloved family member that you just have to put your foot down and tell them, ""No.""  It's not something that's easy to do, and distancing yourself from this anime is like the same thing.  It'll get inside you, take root, and drain the essence out of you while you yourself cry, ""More,"" ""More.""  It's THAT kind of anime.

So maybe I should actually start reviewing it.

Penguin Drum is based around three siblings: the two brothers, Kanba and Shouma, and their sickly sister Himari.  Himari plays out a lot like Cossette from Le Miserables, the picture of innocence around who the story revolves.  Himari suffers from an ""unknown disease"" from which there isn't a cure.  And she dies.  Is that a spoiler?  No, it happens in the first episode.  The story could then turn into a tragic teen drama, but no!  In comes this parasitic penguin hat and she is magically revived!  Himari is then transformed, when she's wearing the hat, into a masochistic foulmouthed magic girl/succubus who tells the brothers that she will die again if they cannot find the Penguin Drum!  What is the Penguin Drum?  Well, Neo-Himari doesn't know, and she also doesn't know if it will really even save their sister's life.  Thus the brothers set off in search of the Penguin Drum.

Confused so far?  I haven't even gotten started yet.

Meet the brothers Kanba and Shouma.  These two will come to have extremely contrasting views on how to obtain the Penguin Drum.  Kanba plays the part of the wild playboy, the irresponsible brother who's left many a women broken-hearted and shows he will go to any length to save his sister.  Any.  Opposite of him is Shouma, the typical hero archetype who believes in goodness and justice and blah blah blah.  Not to say Shouma is a boring or unoriginal character, but it's clear the role he's supposed to play in this series and he barely strays from it, even at the potential cost of his sister's life.

Looking at these two you'll see completely contrasting life views.  Does this play out into the anime?  You bet it does!  These two will constantly be arguing, throwing fists, traveling different paths, and betraying one another.  Trapped in the middle is Himari (non hat version) who knows little other than the fact that she's slowly dying, again.  With all three relationships teetering on collapse, these three must travel this strange journey that'll take them to the most bizarre places and people imaginable.  Worse yet is that the siblings themselves aren't all they appear to be.

In a nutshell, that's the plot.  I could write thousands of paragraphs on some of the other characters, plot twists, and otherwise weird #*$^, but that's an exorcise in self-mutilation.  The plot of Penguin Drum is so convoluted and out there, trying to piece it together would look something like a racketeering investigation with photos on a wall, strings criss-crossing back and forth showing relationships, with hundreds of post-it notes littering up the total picture into an absolute mess.  Is the story hard to understand?  Yes.  Can you still enjoy it?  Definitely.

After plot comes presentation.  The art and animation are, in one single word, abstract.  Think of your local museum and the section dedicated to contemporary art.  Times that by a hundred for each episode.  This is what you'll come to find in each individual background within the animation.  Speaking frankly, you'll be dizzied by the sheer overload of masterpieces in the 22 minute episodes.  Does that make it good?  I couldn't tell you.  It's something you either love or hate, though I can say the former definitely outnumbers the latter.

Next comes the sound.  This is a bit of a mixed bag.  Most of the ambient and background music is well done, but the openings, inserts, and 8 different ending themes don't leave you attached to any of them.  It takes a very similar route as the art, but with perhaps the opposite of results.

Other people's reviews are likely to be completely different than my own, and I kind of think that's the point of Penguin Drum.  Two people can watch together, the same exact episode, and see two completely different things.  This anime is art in the truest sense of the word.  Each and every person who views this will likely have their own unique experience.  I couldn't tell anyone if they'd love it or hate it, but I can be sure that those who'll stick with it will become a part of something that will be very difficult to forget.

Ultimate I have to give Penguin Drum full marks, despite my own personal proclivities with the plot.  Love it or hate it, or hate to love it or love to hate it, you can't deny the power of the impact it possesses.",1350172800,8,5080,4.681766704416761
5309754,5,B009AVCADU,"Penguin Drum is simply something so unique and fantastic that trying to put why it's awesome into words just doesn't work.
Granted it's not something for everybody, but I think that's because people don't look through what's happening on screen.
That's because this series is very philosophical but you don't need to understand every concept and get every point to love it, at its heart Penguin Drum is a story of love, family, bonds and DESTINY!! (when you watch the show you'll get why I capitalized it).",1388534400,,506,4.827586206896552
5309755,5,B009AVCADU,"It looks great
It's in Japanese with English subtitles AND there is an English dub!

5309756,1,B009AVCADU,"As others have noted previously, there are issues with the video quality of this product. This is pretty disappointing, as I had hoped the days of artifacting and messed-up video encodes were behind us when we transitioned from DVD to Blu-Ray, which uses much better video compression codecs (at least for low bitrates).

I'm not sure if this show is encoded at 1080i as some others have said, as I'm only starting my first watchthrough and it happens to be on a 1080i CRT HDTV so I theoretically have no way to visually notice the difference. BUT, it indeed contains sporadic, obvious combing artifacts, which are related to interlacing artifacts. (These combing artifacts would be visible regardless of whether the show is actually encoded at 1080p or 1080i, because they are the result of faulty DE-interlacing from an original source which could have been either of 1080p or 1080i as well). In turn, the messed up interlacing in the encode triggers noticeable MPEG artifacting during high-motion scenes, a phenomena which harkens back to the days of DVD.

I haven't gotten in the habit of checking filesizes on Blu-Rays yet, like I used to for DVDs, so I can't say if the bitrate on this title is too low. It might instead be that the MPEG encoding artifacts are not from the final encode, but an intermediate MPEG-encode that was done by some de-interlacing hardware/software/algorithm which should not have been used to begin with. (You should never use de-interlacing equipment when creating a video recording. If the original show is 1080p, you encode at 1080p. If the original show is 1080i, you leave it as such and encode at 1080i, leaving the de-interlacing up to the equipment used by the viewer, which could be their HDTV, Blu-Ray player, or specialized de-interlacing equipment). In other words, based on the final encoding quality, it might very well be that this show has been twice or three-times re-encoded before it got to the disc.

At least, the combing and artifacting problems seem more pronounced in certain episodes than others. I think it was worst in Episode 2 or 3. But it's unacceptable nonetheless, and if this were any company other than Sentai Filmworks (ADVision) I would expect a recall of this product. Other anime companies who have put out titles in recent years with similar combing artifacts have recalled them and put out a fixed release. But ADVision has never fixed anything before.

Anyway, what I've seen of the show itself is great, 5 stars. But the video quality is 0 stars, and the translation issues others have complained of make more negative stars, so the overall rating for this botched release shall be 1 star! I've never seen the fansubs (yet, though I'm tempted to go back to them when I see Blu-Ray releases like this one) so I didn't mind Sentai Filmworks' translation too much, but there are still plain typos and other strange things that don't seem like they should have been that way.

I am losing faith in Sentai Filmworks, they have made bad releases (poor translations, lack of important extras, etc) for some of their other recent products I have purchased, too.",1372291200,7,3128,4.861163227016886
5309757,4,B009AVCADU,this is a great anime and i  couldn't be any happy. i will be buy from this again . and the price is not bad at all,1369180800,,115,3.259259259259259
5309758,4,B009AVCADU,"When I heard the director for Revolutionary girl Utena was working on a new series I was stoked. I love mind bending anime that makes you think long and hard. I also love mind bending movies/tv shows of the same nature. Penguin drum was an instant buy for me. What can I say that other reviews haven't already fleshed out?

This series is not something you put on in the background while doing stuff (which is difficult for myself as a multitasker). Everything in the series has a purpose and many things are symbols of future things, of emotions, of hidden stuff in the hearts of the characters. This is a series you have to take in piece by piece, watch, then end up rewatching to catch what you had missed the first time because you lacked the keys to understand the full complexity of what was truly being said in that scene.

It's a story about what family is on the basic level and then it asks what family REALLY is. What will the brothers do to save their little sister from her 'fate'? How dirty will they get their hands to just save one person and is one person worth the deaths of others? Like one reviewer before me stated there is a theme about social acceptability/invisablity verses individuality with how they portray anybody not relating to the plot and the 'child grinder'. You will notice that everyone else is just blobs of human form walking around if they are not related to the story somehow and later you see quite a few references to the 'child grinder'. Our society sadly seems to do this just naturally. In high school if you stood out you were either praised or you were shamed where they tried to make you conform to what everyone else was. This takes a peak at the darkness of the human hearts and how even when we're trying to do 'good' the human heart can be lead to do very bad things for the sake of the good.

Sentai filmworks, though I'm glad are around, did some pretty bad decisions with this release. The blu ray is released in it's standard sized blu ray case with two blu ray disks. There are translation issues and subtitle issues through out the release AND it's 1080i instead of the Japanese's original blu ray release of 1080p. I'm not sure if that's how they encode or if that's all they were given, either way during the survival 'tactic' scenes you do see artificing sadly. The series does pop with colors and looks amazing in blu ray either way. Even with Sentai's sloppy job with the product it still deserves 4 stars and worth a watch. The dub is also not bad either.

This series is NOT light hearted fluff (again sentai's marketing department should rethink some of their strategies with that as well) and if you have issues with seeing the dark side of the human heart, homosexuality, and take offense to some very broken characters you may want to look elsewhere. But if you want to see a take on it and love looking into symbols and a deeper storyline then this series is definitely worth the look.",1368835200,3,2955,4.456561922365989
5309759,5,B009AVCADU,"Kunihiko Ikuhara is best known for directing episodes of the ""Sailor Moon"" series but most notably for his work on ""Revolutionary Girl Utena"".  While Ikuhara may not be known for having a long oeuvre in his animated career, Ikuhara has won over fans all over the world for his work.

In 2011, Ikuhara returned with a 24-episode series titled ""Mawaru Penguindrum"" (Penguindrum) produced by Brain's Base.

Directed by Ikuhara and also co-written along with Takayo Ikami (""Heaven's Memo Pad""), the series features the music of Yukari Hashimoto (""Mayo Chiki!"", ""Kanamemo"", ""Toradora!""), original character designs by Lily Hoshino (""Zakuro"", ""Mr. Flower Groom"", ""Otome Yokai Zakuro""), character designs by Terumi Nishii (""Casshern Sins"", ""Death Note"", ""Inuyasha"") and background art by Chieko Nakamura (""Eyeshield 21, ""Azumanga Daioh"", ""Revolutionary Girl Utena"") and Kentaro Akiyama (""Air"", ""Black Rock Shooter"", ""Steel Angel Kurumi"").

VIDEO:

""Penguindrum"" vol. 1 is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  It's important to note that when it comes to anime production, unlike major anime studios who are very busy developing several animated TV series, films and OVA's all at one time, Brain's Base (which is founded by former staff of Tokyo Movie Shinsha) is not one to put themselves in the situation of having too much on their plate.  The good news is that because the staff are not in a major deadline while working on multiple series, they could focus on a series and give it the best quality, even though it's a TV series.

In the case of ""Penguindrum"", everything that you can hope for in a series with many locations, scenery, art backgrounds, characters in different clothing and great amount of detail and shading is featured.  Colors are not subdued or soft, they are colorful and vibrant. I detected no banding issues, no artifacts whatsoever.

""Penguindrum"" is probably one of the coolest anime series that I have seen in quite some time and goes to show that TV anime series can look fantastic and it does on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Penguindrum"" vol. 1 is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 (Japanese and English).  Both are the same when it comes to special effects and in terms of voice acting, both are well done.  I typically listen to the Japanese soundtrack but this is one series where the English dub soundtrack is well-done.  Lossless audio is crystal clear from the front channels.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Penguindrum"" vol. 1 comes with the clean opening and closing animation.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I heard that Kunihiko Ikuhara was working on another anime series, like many anime fans who were stoked with the big news, for me, I felt like it was about time.

Having enjoyed his work for ""Sailor Moon"" and ""Revolutionary Girl Utena"", I don't know how many times I saw next to Ikuhara at an anime convention that I was covering, asking if he was working on any new projects.

There is this style and also creativity that he brings to his anime series, may it be the fashion aspect or even the Yuri elements and relationships which were pretty bold for an anime TV series.

With that being said, he's one of those directors that needs creative control to bring that high-level of creativeness and I know that some studios are hesitant unless it's someone near legendary status in the anime industry.

While ""Revolutionary Girl Utena"" is from the 1996-1997 (with the film in 1999), it has been over a decade until he got to direct again and this time, it looks like he has creative control with ""Penguindrum"".  And his collaboration with Brain's Base turned out to be very effective as this is one of the coolest, stylish, freshest TV series that I have seen in terms of quality.

As mentioned earlier, popular studios are always working on multiple series and so art backgrounds are typically trees, skies and occasional buildings, but for ""Penguindrum"", this is a series that requires a lot of locations.  Characters travel to so many different areas around the city and each background is detailed.  Also, I like it when characters are shown wearing different clothes.  With TV series, to make things easier on the animators for deadline, most often the characters are wearing the same clothes.  But Brain's Base put a lot of time in making sure these characters have different clothing.

Character designs and art backgrounds are fantastic and on Blu-ray, this is one of the most vibrant TV series I have seen.  If there is one factor that I wish the Blu-ray had was special features.  May it be commentary, featurettes, Japanese commercials or promotional videos, something other than opening and ending credits.

As for the storyline, there is a lot of humor, a lot of flashbacks and twists and turns.  At the beginning, we are often wondering why a character like Shouma is having to follow this crazy stalker, Ringo.  But we slowly see each layer peel away to reveal Ringo's true intentions but also how her past connects with the Takakura's.

Suffice to say, when you get to episode 10-12, things get crazy and it leaves you craving for more!

Overall, ""Penguindrum"" vol . 1 is an amazing series.  It's different from previous Ikuhara works such as ""Revolutionary Girl Utena"" and even ""Sailor Moon"", but with a solid storyline, cool and interesting characters and wonderful animation and art backgrounds, ""Penguindrum"" is an amazing series that I highly recommend on Blu-ray!",1364601600,3,5420,4.981111111111111
5309760,4,B009AVCADU,The dubbed version was better than expected. The story itself is solid. The only real issue is the lack of special features.,1363305600,,124,4.681818181818182
5309761,3,B009AVCADU,"I was so excited when I heard Mawaru Penguindrum was coming out in the US. It was something I had been waiting for. The series was one of my all time favorite anime series. Actually not just one of my all time favorites, it is my all time favorite. I was looking forward to seeing it on my big screen TV and eager to support it by buying it.

Now the reason for only 3 stars - I really wish another company besides Sentai had gotten this series.  One that would have done a better job.  I was watching the subs and they really weren't good.  At first I thought maybe it's just because I watched the fansubbed version so many times that I was used to their wording, but no.  It seems like Sentai was really careless with the subs.  At one point Kanba says ""we gotta got hold of Uncle."" Gotta got?  Didn't anyone check these things? There are more instances where I found myself wondering ""how careless were the people who subbed this thing?""

Aside from the errors, there were some changes to the script. The most notable change was changing the series' catch phrase from ""survival strategy"" to ""survival tactic"" in the subs.  Another example I can think of off the top of my head is when Kanba (in episode 1) said his speech at the end; instead of saying  ""Dear God, is he really human? Just wondering,"" he says ""could God...really be human? Yeah right."" Uh, what? I won't post the whole speech, but I will say that doesn't even make sense in the context of what he's talking about. The first line does - he's talking about if someone loved another person in spite of their DNA or fate, could that person cast those things aside and still be considered human?  The second line has him asking a philosophical question about the nature of God out of left field.

It's just sloppy work all the way around. I'm torn now - on the one hand I really want to buy the DVDs and support a series that gave me so much joy. On the other hand, I don't want to support Sentai's shoddy work.",1361923200,25,1975,4.308108108108108

Insted we get an akward sounding dub, with not so great to terrible sounding voice actors. Youre probably saying ""Oh, thats fine! I don't even watch the dub."" Well the sub is no better, the intent of various scenes and the overall point of the series ends up not making sense... Let me put it this way- FOR ONCE FANSUBS ARE BETTER.

Of course it has surreal imagery considering Kunihiku Ikuhara directed it (Revolutionary Girl Utena, watch that too!) and provides a unique eye to the perspective of storytelling and imagery. The main thing to take away from this show as a viewer, is how impressive the relationships are developed and depicted. I wholeheartedly disagree with those reviews saying this show has shallow character development. I believe that there are details in the beautiful animation and backgrounds of this show that make this family of characters feel very real to one another. There is history there and you have to hang in there before the secrets and truths start being revealed. But once they do, and you go back and realize some of the subtle hints that had been there from the first episode, you will truly appreciate the story.

8538745,2,B009AVCADU,"Sentai Filmworks gave us a 1080i transfer when the Japanese audience over in Japan got 1080P transfers on their Blu-ray discs. This means the U.S. audience got a inferior version of Penguin Drum on Blu-ray...plain and simple!!

This is totally unacceptable, and to add insult to injury, Sentai  Filmworks has yet to address this problem or explain to us why this happen.

Do yourself a favor and skip buying this release until they re-release it with a true 1080p transfer..don't waste your money.",1404518400,2,497,4.963855421686747
8538746,4,B009AVCADU,"I really really love this anime and i've watched it before but now i'm able to purchase it. My only complain is the subtitles are big, chunky, yellow and annoying.",1400976000,,163,4.466666666666667
8538747,5,B009AVCADU,"Penguins, apples, little sisters, musicals, aquariums, terrorists, magical girl transformation scenes, teddy bears, frogs, destiny, a mysterious diary, numerous flashbacks, train rides, rabbit twins, talking eels and sea otters, amnesia bullets, stalkers, attempted rape, reincarnation, weird penguin hats, and numerous other random terms could be used to describe this show. This is an extremely random and weird show, but is definitely one of the few psychological and philosophical anime of the twenty first century, which is a positive thing.

The anime starts out with a loving family of brothers, Shma Takakura (blue hair) and Kanba Takakura (red hair) and a cute little sister, Himari Takakura. They go to the aquarium, but then Himari collapses and is pronounced dead. She immediately comes back to life due to the strange penguin hat she was wearing. She claims that the two brothers must find something called the Penguindrum so she will remain alive. The three of them are assisted by three cute little penguins that only they can see. On their mission, the brothers meet a girl named Ringo Oginome, who exhibits some strange behavior like stalking their homeroom teacher and wanting her sister's desires to come to fruition by any means necessary.

The first half of the series is somewhat lighthearted and comical in appearance, but the second half is a lot darker and starts answering the viewer's many questions throughout the series. Trying to explain any more of the series is just ludicrous because of the many plot devices and strange occurrences in the show. To summarize, the show is about penguins and apples at its core. It is also the latest anime from Kunihiko Ikuhara, the director of Revolutionary Girl Utena, which is also a very good anime; maybe even better than this show. Both shows have similar psychological and philosophical themes, and both feature pink haired characters.

This series is licensed by Sentai Filmworks and comes in a 3 disc set. There are no real special features, just like most Sentai anime. Notably, the English dub is fine for the main characters, but a lot of the minor characters sound like they did not even try to cast them properly. The teacher character sounds extraordinarily plain and dull for the first half of the series, but in the second half, he is voiced by someone else, and has a much deeper voice, which is appropriate for the second half's content. The animation for this anime is very nice and the music is really good. The second half has at least seven different closing theme songs, which is incredible for only 12 episodes.",1390694400,3,2602,5.0046189376443415
