$10 for both movies, plus bonus features, on Blu-ray is a great deal... and that's why I gave it 5 stars.

2987638,4,B000WMVGX6,"This is partially a review of the movie(s), partially a review of the quality on dvd.

I purchased this for 8 or 9 dollars shipped from Amazon. Crazy good price. Ultimate Avengers and Ultimate Avengers 2 are great movies. I own next Avengers on DVD. So I've seen all of these before.

First, a parent disclaimer, if you don't like your kids seeing very violent/scary things, I would put this more on the 'pg parents strongly cautioned '. To my memory, no blood or little blood, but these are pretty violent movies.

Now to my Marvel fans. These are a must have. Back in the day, when Marvel came out with a new great movie every year or so, these classics were produced.

Visually very good. I believe this is a combination of hand drawn and cgi, so great color pop, but also rich textures. Sound? Not as impressive. It was very quiet, the explosions didn't EXPLODE, etc. If you have top of the line surround sound, probably no issue for you. My mediocre surround sound picks up great in dts, and I was sad to see this was not an option.

Back to the movie. First one has a good story, but the second one is where it really gets slammed in your face. Did you see the avengers? Similar caliber on the small screen, visually.

Next avengers. Meh. Ok. Not bad. Probably Alot safer for the kiddos. Newer, more cgi, probably better sound but I haven't watched my version yet.

Back to the fans. If you are a Marvel fan, and you like ultimate avengers, you NEED to see/buy: invincible iron man, doctor strange, I think there was a movie called black panther too? Or at least, centered around that story. You won't regret it.

Questions, or want updates, just ask. I love Marvel and dc, but these are a classic and MUST HAVE!!",1406419200,10,1719,4.417721518987341

2987650,4,B000WMVGX6,"I enjoy the two Avengers movies, but the third bonus movie is about kids for kids. I know the whole package is a cartoon and strictly for kids anyway. But I'm an adult who love comics and superheroes, and consider animated movies not just for kids, and the main two movies fit that category. The third movie however, even though Iron Man and the Hulk are themselves, is about the kids of superheroes. I like my superheroes always the same age and without kids, so a storyline where they are dead and their kids continue their legacy doesn't appeal to me.",1359331200,,554,4.4950495049504955

3222147,4,B000WMVGX6,"I enjoy the two Avengers movies, but the third bonus movie is about kids for kids. I know the whole package is a cartoon and strictly for kids anyway. But I'm an adult who love comics and superheroes, and consider animated movies not just for kids, and the main two movies fit that category. The third movie however, even though Iron Man and the Hulk are themselves, is about the kids of superheroes. I like my superheroes always the same age and without kids, so a storyline where they are dead and their kids continue their legacy doesn't appeal to me.",1359331200,,554,4.4950495049504955
