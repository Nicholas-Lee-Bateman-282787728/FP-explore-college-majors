8293611,5,B001DJ7PXC,This movie is filmed in 2002 and was released in 2009. It uses fake fraternities. It is prob the 8th best college stepping movie. So worth your two hours.,1450137600,,154,4.344827586206897

8293615,2,B001DJ7PXC,"Overall, I rate this movie a 2 because the plot was very weak. It was obviously a low budget movie with well known actors and actresses in it. However, these otherwise good actors/actresses couldn't make this movie good at all in my opinion.",1294876800,,241,4.627906976744186

8293617,3,B001DJ7PXC,"This film had promise but it failed to deliver on so many levels.  Yet, I do applaud the director for a freshmen effort.  The cast was great and there are many familiar faces.  However, there could have been more actual stepping and less dialogue!",1273622400,,247,4.568181818181818
8293618,2,B001DJ7PXC,"A college campus springs to life when the local radio station announces the official opening of the step competition season. At UTS, the Greeks rule the campus but the Steppers are the kings of the hill. Step season is underway, and with a big money prize up for grabs the heat is on. As the fraternities and sororities work to recruit the best talent around, dance fever sweeps the campus. The plot of this movie was not that bad but it was very low budget. It does have it's funny moments with guest appearances from Anthony Anderson, Faizon Love, Monique and many others that you may have seen from previous movies. But the movie did leave you wondering at the end. There were some things left out and the timeline was a little off. The quality of the picture was definetly the worst part. Not even worth the rental.",1269820800,3,819,4.503355704697986
