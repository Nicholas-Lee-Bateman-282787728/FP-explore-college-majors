8495760,5,B006A9XU0W,"Had to watch this on netflix because the DVD is the wrong code for the US (PAL-Europe) so it doesn't play on our DVD player.  It had been given as a gift so it was a little embarrassing.  The documentary content is great, really gives you the lowdown on Susan.  What a great voice!",1397001600,,281,4.166666666666667
8495761,5,B006A9XU0W,"This is a great behind the scenes look at Susan and how her life has changed since BGT. She facinates me, how she is very down to earth and yet when she sings she becomes a different person, very powerful.  I love this documentary.",1383004800,,231,4.25
8495762,5,B006A9XU0W,"I rarely do a perfect rating, but this is one perfect rating.  I watched Susan just like everyone else, I marveled and was pissed off how the world over looked her and her talent.  She was so perfect in that she had no hate...How many people turn their anger into hate now days, but there is Susan giving hope to millions.

Watch and learn about Susan...I would kiss her and be proud to to know and love her!",1381017600,2,408,4.205128205128205
8495763,5,B006A9XU0W,"This dvd is in PAL format therefore requires a PAL or multi-system dvd player.
It was produced for Australia and is sold as an import.  As far as I know, it was not produced in the US, but was seen only when broadcast on TLC and is offered on Netflix.  Therefore, this is a wonderful chance to own the dvd.  I came across it by accident on Amazon as it never occurred to me that there would be a way to buy it.
DVD includes the incredible documentary ""Susan Boyle An Unlikely Superstar"" as well as 3 black and white videos of Susan singing ""You Have To Be There"", ""Autumn Leaves"", and ""Unchained Melody"".  It also includes an ""Australian Photo Book"" which is comprised of many photos taken during Susan's trip down under in November 2011.  This is a wonderful dvd to keep and as a gift for a Susan Boyle fan.",1346112000,5,808,4.2894736842105265
