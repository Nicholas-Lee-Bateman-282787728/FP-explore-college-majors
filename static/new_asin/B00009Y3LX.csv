My bachelor party was just like any other -- hot girls, lots of booze, a phat limo.  Little did I know that my (ex) best friend would be bringing a video camera along for the ride.  What seemed like a harmless idea at the time, turned into my worst nightmare.

When the party exceeded expectations, my (ex) best friend decided to sell the footage.  A buddy from work gets his hands on the DVD, shows it to my wife - six months later - I'm on the tail end of a divorce, staring down the neck of an empty bottle of gin.

But, man... it was all worth it!

He may not be my best friend anymore, but I'll give him credit where credit is due -- he threw one hell of a bachelor party for me.  I don't remember most of my party, so in a way, I'm glad that he taped the whole evening.  ""Caught on Tape: Bachelor Party"" is filled with all of the shocking content you love to see at a great bachelor party.  The lap dances, the drinking, hanging out of the sunroof of the limo, fighting with the bartender after he tells you that he's cutting you off, puking on your shoes... it's all there, and more!  That's what bachelor parties are all about.
I'm looking forward to the next time I get married, so my new best friend can throw me an even better bachelor party.
So if you want to know what a real bachelor party is all about, ""Caught on Tape: Bachelor Party"" is the only DVD you need.",1062720000,7,1469,4.137323943661972
