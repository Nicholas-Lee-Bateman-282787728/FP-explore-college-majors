6673098,5,B00NNQJJ4Q,Unexpectedly clean & mild & I loved that. William Shockley is wonderful to watch & the reason why I bought this movie (not from Amazon). I liked it a lot.,1431043200,,154,4.166666666666667
6673099,5,B00NNQJJ4Q,"Not what I thought it was going to be, turned out better than i thought. I really enjoyed this movie.",1429315200,,101,4.1
6673100,1,B00NNQJJ4Q,0/5 Rating but forced to leave 1/5.  This movie sucked!!!,1424908800,2,57,4.7
6673101,5,B00NNQJJ4Q,"I have to disagree.  I found the story compelling.  Yes, it's rated R for language, nudity, and violence; but this film is ultimately about second chances and loyalty to family.  It felt like a contemporary Western with evil bad guys and flawed but honorable protagonists.  And the score was exceptional!",1421452800,2,304,5.02
6673102,1,B00NNQJJ4Q,"The storyline for this movie is bland, predictable, and over dramatic.",1420416000,2,70,5.454545454545454
6673103,2,B00NNQJJ4Q,"Contains what some may consider ""Plot Spoilers.""

With a title like ""Born Wild"" I was expecting something more than a Lifetime style drama. CJ (William Shockley who also wrote script) gets out of prison for what seems like killing a fellow biker. He meets fellow biker Billy of the Underground biker gang.. CJ tell him that if he ever sees him again, he will have to kill him. Now normally you would think they did this for a reason, i.e. you are going to see him again in some great action scene involving biker shootouts and gang fights. My bad. This is a drama. It was done to show us what a nice guy CJ has become while he proclaims ""I'm not a good man.""

CJ returns to his Texas home town of Banshee and visits dad (Barry Corbin) and an old girlfriend (Tanya Clarke) whose bar is in trouble and may go under. Her ex-husband (Kix Brooks) is the banker who holds the note, and he wants the deed. I was bored to tears until an hour and twenty minutes into the film when they decided to mop up this mess with everyone getting shot with bad guys only able to hit people in the arm.

A biker ex-con film that is a drama. The film has lengthy discussions about regret and time lost, which I found over dramatic and boring. If that is your cup of tea, go for it.

Guide: F-bomb, sex  and nudity.",1418428800,5,1292,4.2145748987854255
8679318,4,B00NNQJJ4Q,"I actually enjoyed the movie, but the plot line described in the advertisement could have been written, ""Con gets out of prison and must confront leaving his motorcycle club behind - for the first 10 minutes.  After that, it's a story of redemption"".  That at least would've at least been honest.

Still, I liked the film.  I'm a big fan of second chances (Lord knows I've prayed for more second chances than I deserved) and it's good to find a move where all the bad guys die, the good guys live and love conquers all.

Just don't think you're going to see something along the lines of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-The-Law/dp/B00005ONLF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond The Law</a>.  It's not a biker movie.",1480032000,,762,5.47008547008547
8679319,1,B00NNQJJ4Q,"Spoilers Ahead!!! This is what you call a rip off. The description I read for Born Wild said, An ex-con returns home to confront his old biker gang. If I wrote a description, it would be, An ex-con returns home, seeking lost love & redemption. Judging this movie by it's description & movie poster (The movie poster is way misleading. If it was done to get you to watch then I fell for it) I was expecting action, adventure, or excitement but there was none of it. Anything you'd normally expect to see in a biker movie, Born Wild was the opposite. There was no biker gang except at the start of the movie & that was only 2 guys. It was VERY S.....L.....O.....W paced. Nothing happens at all (Except the way the one character committed suicide which was shocking) till the very end of the movie & it has nothing at all to do with his ex biker gang or any biker gang. Born Wild is what I'd imagine it would be like if somebody who writes romance novels, wrote a novel or screenplay about an ex biker gang member returning home after spending time in prison, trying to make up for his past. Born Wild? More like Born Mild",1466467200,,1119,4.308056872037914
8679320,5,B00NNQJJ4Q,Definitely a must see movie that will make you think.,1446768000,,53,4.4
8679321,3,B00NNQJJ4Q,Nice movie but be aware this is not a biker movie.,1441238400,,50,3.6363636363636362

8679323,4,B00NNQJJ4Q,"I enjoyed the film. But then, I'd enjoy watching Shockley brush his teeth. However, whoever wrote the editorial obviously hasn't seen the movie. CJ gets out of prison for killing a fellow biker. Has a short dealing with the biker gang which lasts all of 2 minutes. Then he's off to Banshee, TX (is there such a place?) and proceeds to break up a gun running operation, save a store, find out he has a son and bonds with him, mends relationships with his estranged father and ex girlfriend. ALL the good guys live. Not a bad story, but definitely not what was written in Amazon's editorial.",1438819200,,589,4.514018691588785
8679324,5,B00NNQJJ4Q,"I loved this movie, but then I'm a huge William Shockley fan. I love him and that hair of his. he's still a great and talented actor that's very easy on the eyes but then he's always been handsome. it did have some slow moments but all in all it was a pretty good movie",1438473600,,269,3.909090909090909
8679325,3,B00NNQJJ4Q,"not a biker movie at, more a love story than anything. Very disappointing.",1437004800,,74,4.769230769230769
8679326,4,B00NNQJJ4Q,"I liked the movie, and would have like it even more if I could have understood some of the words.  There was no captioning of this film so I had to guess some times what they were saying.  But a good movie.  I liked the main actor and the one who played his dad.",1434326400,,262,3.814814814814815
8679327,5,B00NNQJJ4Q,Order came on time. Packaging was perfect! LOVED the movie. A GREAT addition to my DVD Library! A MUST see. Touching. ,1432944000,,118,4.619047619047619
