""World Travelers""

Blue and her little brother, Sprinkles, use their imaginations to travel all around the world! They hit Antarctica, Brazil, Egypt and more. They're looking for three keys to unlock a trunk.

""Away Great Play Date""

A most interesting episode of the show. When a friend visits Blue's Room, he accidentally leaves behind his hat. So Joe takes Blue and Sprinkles on adventure in the real world to many places to try to get it back to him. A most unusual and special adventure from this show.

Here's the ""Blue's Clues"" content:

""Environments""

There's more world exploration here. This is a Steve episode and he and Blue play Blue's Clues to discover the environment that Blue wants to visit.

""Special Spaces""

A.K.A. ""Blue's New Place."" This episode is part of the story arc in which Mr. Salt and Mrs. Pepper prepare for their new baby. In this one, Blue and her friends are all creating new places for themselves. We play Blue's Clues with Steve to figure what Blue wants to do in her own special space. We explore our friends' new places as well.

As always, the episodes are presented well, with close-captioning and Dolby Digital audio.",1198022400,20,1505,4.83984375
2918581,5,B000UAE7TK,"A recent interest and a definite winner with my toddler. She fell in love with the blue puppy and she (Blue) has a great way of educating and expanding young minds. Music, dance, imagination, drawing, coloring, tracing, exploring, you name it Blue does it in her movies. I ended up purchasing all the dvd's to make certain my daughter doesn't get bored with the same dvds over and over. However she doesn't mind and enjoys her blues clues. Big on imagination? I recommend this toddler Nick Jr character for your kids.",1194912000,,517,4.6923076923076925
