8681827,5,B00O3GUYZ8,"This is very nice collection of silent comedy films, at a very good price. John K. Carpenter (The Movie Man) has shared some films from his collection, presented here with some jazzy music. The films on this DVD are from the Hal Roach studios, made in the mid-1920s, shortly before Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy became world-famous as a beloved comedy team. Stan Laurel was directly involved with most of the films on this set, either as performer, director or writer. Three of these films had been available on the ""Lost Films of Laurel & Hardy"" series, but those DVDs are out of print, so this might be the only way to obtain these films for some time.

SHORT KILTS (1924) is a Stan Laurel solo film, co-starring later L&H co-star James Finlayson.
YES, YES NANETTE (1925) stars Finlayson, Lyle Tayo, and co-starring Oliver Hardy! Stan Laurel directed this film, and it would have been interesting to be on the set with these soon-to-be partners in comedy.
SHOULD SAILORS MARRY? (1925) stars Clyde Cook, and features appearances by Oliver Hardy and future L&H co-stars Noah Young and Fay Holderness.
DIZZY DADDIES (1926) stars Tyler Brooke and James Finlayson, with some very funny farce comedy, co-written by Stan Laurel.
THE MERRY WIDOWER (1926) also stars Brooke and Finlayson, with a cameo appearance by great Roach comedy star Charley Chase.
ON THE FRONT PAGE (1926) starring Tyler Brooke and Stan Laurel, in a funny farce.",1485648000,2,1428,4.8765432098765435
