2792862,5,B000O7861Y,"Absolutely great Hagar footage.

Why someone who is NOT a Hagar Fan, would view this DVD is absolutely beyond me.

So for the one star dork who asked the question why can't old gezers like Sammy get out of the way........Well, why watch the concert in the first place?

A Hagar fan who DOESN'T like this, well, I can respect, if not agree with that.  But if you don't like Sammy in the first place, why waste your time?

Sam man touches on many great hits that HAGAR fans want to see.  He rips loose on the guitar quite a bit so that adds to the project.

St. Louis must be an absolute AWESOME city to see Hagar play in as the audience is comepletely into the show.  I've seen Sammy before, but never in St. Looo.  Given I'm a die hard Rams fan, I need some stars to align for me and make a trip to kill two birds with one stone.

If you ARE a Hagar fan, you WILL love this DVD.  If you are NOT a Hagar fan, you probably won't.  But then agian, why would you bother?

Hat's off to the Red Rocker!

2792863,5,B000O7861Y,"As I write this, I am listening to Sammy's DVD release concert LIVE on KSHE.  It sold out in minutes.  What is it with St. Louis and Sammy Hagar.  At one of his shows, we know all the words and sing along during the show.  It does not matter if it is Montrose, Sammy Solo, or Van Halen (Van Hagar in St. Louis), we love it.  I tried to find the DVD at lunch and it was already sold out.  You really have to hear Sammy live to appreciate his music.  Buy this DVD and then go see a show, after drinking lots of tequila of course.",1182297600,4,527,3.869158878504673
2792874,1,B000O7861Y,"Love Sammy in all forms, but Mona Gnader ruins this for me.  As soon as I heard her sing, I removed the DVD and through it out.  I have only written a few reviews in my life, but I'm warning anyone considering this purchase.  Just watched Sammy on LIVE AT DARYL'S (Daryl Hall) HOUSE, which I highly recommend!  It was recorded at Sammy's in Cabo, yet he has the lack of taste to have her sing backup, never mind letting this recording be published.  Hugely disappointed fan!!!  I highly recommend SAMMY AND THE CIRCLE though!",1435708800,,525,4.473684210526316
2792875,5,B000O7861Y,"Great show, great musicians, and Sammy is definitely one of the truly greats of all time. I saw this tour in Burgettsown Pa and this DVD was a reminder of how great a show this was!",1429920000,,181,4.055555555555555

I had been looking for this for a long time.  Yea; I found it.  I hope you've got a big screen and surround sound so you can really enjoy it.

2792883,3,B000O7861Y,I wished they would have played a better selection of songs.  Not sure  I liked the selection of his woman back-up singer.  She seemed to over sing Sammy often.  Did not prefer her sound.,1386892800,,187,4.411764705882353
2792884,4,B000O7861Y,Sammy & the Wabos is one of my favorite groups. I think Sammy is a great entertainer and wanted a copy of a Wabos show. Check it out.,1383955200,,133,3.7857142857142856
2792885,4,B000O7861Y,"I totally enjoyed ""Livin It Up! Live in St. Louis.""

I saw them on this particular tour and it brings back fond memories of good music and party.

This was good money spent. I will enjoy it for years.

Great sound and camera work, especially when Sam plays solos.",1379462400,,263,4.326530612244898

2792889,5,B000O7861Y,"This is a first rate show and sound all around, and it really partys and rocks.  If you like Beer GoGGles bring them because there are many beautiful women in bikinis.  It would seem that the alcohol Sammy was drinking was more than a prop for the party.  The show became a party and he did great except for repeating the Sam I Am intro line a second time.  I personally thought that was funny that he was so drunk but I was drunk at the time too.

I especially appreciated the VanHagar half with Anthony but it was very good.  I liked it so much it made me rethink why I hated VanHagar so much and wanted VanHalen reunited.  Presto and VanHalen is reunited so my wish came true from watching this Mdvd play on Netflix.  I just had to buy this to get me by until then because it left Netflix.  To tell you the truth I could not get his Little White Lies out of my head after I heard it the first time on Netflix.  This is a very good sounding recording and will not disappoint you.

The VanHagar here is a good buy this if you like loud party music and VanHalen.  Be careful what you wish for or you might buy this and have so much fun you could get a hang over and want to do it again!  More Little White Lies!",1326412800,3,1211,4.01673640167364
2792890,3,B000O7861Y,This concert video is great EXCEPT for the female guitar singer.  That chick can NOT sing!

There has got to be a better Sammy Hagar video out there.,1297987200,,278,4.392156862745098

He just simply kicks but. And this dvd will not fail you. If you don,t own it, and you are a red rocker fan as i am this is a must have.",1252886400,2,320,3.7205882352941178

Micheal Anthony(Former Van Halen Bassist)And let's loose on the Van Halen stuff he and Micheal did together. A concert recorded live in St. Louis,Mo.with sammy's tequilla being poured continuosly through out the entire concert,makes for a great time watching the video.",1231286400,3,549,4.851063829787234

2792905,5,B000O7861Y,"I purchased this dvd based on all the 5-star reviews. Last time I saw Sammy was on the Sam and Dave Tour. This is way better than that tour. This dvd delivers in all ways, great rock and roll, sammy jammin on guitar, very hot girls, love all the new songs from the ""Livin it Up"" cd (which I have), and Michael Anothony on Bass for the Van Hager songs. Lot of fun, great extras. Sammy always gives it his all, at his shows. He is at his best when he is solo. Hope to see Sammy live again. It is a party, you don't want to miss. 5-stars.",1214179200,,535,3.9174311926605503
2792906,5,B000O7861Y,"Every DVD release Sammy does gets better and better. He just continues to get better with age...and I like him a heck of a lot better outside of Van Halen. As others have said, this is almost like being there. Crank it up and party with the Red Rocker.

Now, how about a reissue of the amazing MTV 1983 concert on DVD!!!",1202256000,,320,4.161290322580645

2792908,5,B000O7861Y,"The Good
If you've ever been to a Sammy Hagar show in recent times, then you know that every show is a party. Hagar's stop in St. Louis is no exception. The stage is set-up to mimic Sammy's Cabo Wabo Cantina Bar. There are people in bleachers on stage, sand, palm trees, and every other object that could ever remind you of the beach. Let's not forget about hot women. There are plenty that bring out Waboritas for the ""red rocker"" in between songs. Sammy even echoes the words of his lovely wife after a few have come out; `you can look, but don't touch!' The 5.1 sound is phenomenal, and makes you feel you were right in the middle of the action.

Ever the party animal, Hagar get the show started with a celebration, complete with confetti and the like. I guess it's the only way to start off with the party hit ""Mas Tequila."" To keep the vibe going, Sammy and his Wabos segue into one of their newer tracks ""Mexico."" Which I must say comes off better live than it did on the studio album. Hagar bust out a few of his classic solo material as well as a few Montrose hits, before kicking out his latest theme song ""Sam I Am."" After Sammy brings the house down with his well-known hits ""I Can't Drive 55,"" and ""Heavy Metal,"" it's time for an old friend to hit the stage.

Hagar's old-band mate Michael Anthony takes over bass duties and he and the ""red rocker"" barrel through a few Van Halen hits. They play ""Summer Nights"" for the first time since the 5150 Tour and even eliminate the keyboards for a rocking version of ""Right Now."" To keep the party vibe going, even as the doors are closing, Hagar ends on a high note with ""Cabo Wabo."" When all is said and done, you're pissed that the party is over. The DVD bonus material is minimal, but they're still a treat for fans.

The Bad
The Beastie Boys' cover ""Fight for Your Right"" sounds just horrible. I can understand it's a song about partying, but it sucks...bad!

The Verdict
The Livin' It Up! Live in St. Louis DVD is the next best thing to attending a Sammy Hagar concert, strike that; a Sammy Hagar party. It's non-stop energy from the opening note to the final chord. When the party's over, you'll be that guy that doesn't want to leave that they have to call the cops for.",1201046400,6,2233,4.322195704057279
2792909,5,B000O7861Y,"I recently bought a Sony Bravia 46"" 1080p LCD and upconvert Toshiba 1080p DVD player.  There are not enough Blu-Ray or HD DVD titles to justify the cost in my opinion. I also have a older Sony ES receiver that is a 5.1 Dolby Digital and DTS receiver with non-Sony speakers ( Polk Audio and DCM ).

I played this one night after a night out with the wife and was blown away. The picture is great and so is the sound! Sounds like you are there! I have played this
DVD twice in last 2 weeks and believe it can't be much better on Blu-Ray or HD

2792912,5,B000O7861Y,"I've seen Sammy several times. Most were outdoor venues like this. You can easily buy a LIVE CD, But this will give you all the visual aid needed to get the experience of the show. Put on some shorts. Make a pitcher of Margaritas, and turn it up loud. Every time I re-watch this video, it gives me a feeling of being at ""that party"" you always talk about.  The Long Road to Cabo DVD is also good as a Documentary of the Sam & Dave Tour. Lots of music and bonus's. The Birthday Bash DVD has a great set list, and is shot at the Cabo Wabo Cantina.

While Roth always forget lyrics (the same as 22 years ago), moves nothing on stage and do nothing but try to scream with the remains of his voice, Sammy still rocks! Never forgets a word, always takin' care of the show and his fans, and prove that VH will never be the greatest band in the world without him. This concert is a must-have for a big readhead as me, so if you don't have bought this yet, what are you waiting for?",1194566400,,611,4.464285714285714

I attended this concert, and the only thing better than this DVD, is being there live.  They did cut Michael Anthony doing, ""Running with the Devil"", but that was the only thing different from the actual show.

He threw the biggest and best summer party around and invited 30,000 of his friends to join him. His St. Louis shows are always great and you can tell he and the Wabos are having a very good time throughout the show. He played music from every era of his carrer including Montorse and VH. This show is sure to please Sammy fans from every walk of his career. With Micheal Anthony joining him for all the Van Halen era music, the show couldn't have been any better. I guess I should mention that the HD DVD picture is spectacular and the sound choices should please just about anyone.",1184716800,2,728,4.207142857142857
2792922,5,B000O7861Y,"I watched this DVD this past weekend, and well, all I can say is that I felt like I was actually at a Sammy Hagar concert!  This release really has a great live feel to it.  Fortunately, the editing was done well, with not too many camera angles or split second angle changes that have plagued many DVD releases in recent years (like Iron Maiden's last 2 live DVDs).  The camera is actually allowed to linger on one shot for more than a fraction of a second.  In addition to a well produced video, the setlist is also great as well as the audio.  This DVD really is like being at a big Sammy Hagar party!

The only thing that I would change on this release is how loud Mona's background vocals are on certain songs.  Her background vocals are too loud in the mix and are at times as loud or louder than Sammy's.  Michael Anthony's vocals, however, are perfect during the second half of the set.  I like Mona on bass in this band, but it sure would be nice to see Michael as the full time bassist for Sammy now that he's been booted from Van Halen.  I believe that Sammy and Michael are just meant to be togther and I hope to see this happen sometime in the near future.",1183939200,17,1169,4.178571428571429
2792923,5,B000O7861Y,"This is a fun DVD.  It shows Sammy in one of his favorite cities, St. Louis, doing what he does best .. playing live and having fun.
Who cares that Sammy is a 60 year old seasoned veteran ... he still rocks like he's 20 and gives meaning to the phrase ""old is only how you feel"".
What I like about this DVD is the fact that he plays his staples, then throws in some almost forgotten classics (The Girl Gets Around, I'll Fall In Love Again) and even when Micheal Anthony joins him on stage, you get some staples of a Van Halen set and lost gems like Summer Nights and Good Enough.
If you love good time rock and roll from one of the greats ... get this DVD.",1182988800,4,656,4.00763358778626

Never saw Vic Johnson on guitar before. This guy kicks ass! One hell of a guitar player. Great songs and stage setting. The only downside is when the female bass player sings back up vocals.
