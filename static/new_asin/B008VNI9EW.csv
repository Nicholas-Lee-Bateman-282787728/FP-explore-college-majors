5185414,5,B008VNI9EW,"I own all 6 Lucy Seasons and Seasons 7-9, which are also known as the Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour (I think they should have it titled as this to avoid confusion).
The artwork has changed since I bought my copy but the product has not...
There are some really great episodes any Lucy fan would not want to miss on these discs! From alaska to hunting for uranium to lucy and the mustache, all of the episodes are great, but my absolute favorite is where they go to Japan! Fried Grasshoppers anyone? Not for Lucy, she just wants pearls.
I HIGHLY recommend getting Seasons 7-9! These are Hour long episodes that some people don't even know exist or think they are 30 min episodes, like Seasons 1-6.",1355529600,65,688,4.468253968253968

5185424,5,B008VNI9EW,"I recently purchased this 13 episode disc set of THE LUCY-DESI COMEDY HOUR episodes back in July of this year. Previously, I used to watch these episodes when they aired on Saturday nights on Nick at Nite back in 1994 and 1995 (along with repeats of I LOVE LUCY and THE LUCY SHOW), and I loved every minute of these episodes. Some of my favorites episodes are when Lucy goes to Havana to meet Ricky, Lucy Gets a Job, Lucy Meets Danny, and The Ricardos go to Japan. I am glad that I was able to find these episodes on DVD because I never thought that I would be able to watch them again, nor have I seen these episodes in over 20 years. What I also enjoy about these DVDs are that they are filled with extra clips and deleted scenes, and rare footage from several of the episodes, and this is stuff that I never got to see when the shows were broadcast in repeats back in the 1990's. For anyone who is a LUCY fan, I recommend buying these DVDs as a collection of Lucy episodes.",1472342400,2,976,4.169312169312169

5185489,5,B008VNI9EW,"Not to be confused with the original ""I Love Lucy,"" these last 3 seasons were actually part of ""The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show,"" or later known as ""The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"" from the 1960s- early 1980s and ""We Love Lucy"" from 1987-present, which aired from 1957-1960. Both Ball and Arnaz were growing tired of doing the weekly series ""I Love Lucy"" so Arnaz pitched the idea to CBS about doing occasional one hour specials that would air several times a year. CBS eventually agreed to the idea and filming began in the early summer of 1957. And if you notice in the 3rd episode of the series Lucille Ball changed her iconic hair style to what her hairdresser called the ""Artichoke or Bubble Cut"" and Lucille used different variations of the style for the rest of her life. However, by this time the Ball-Arnaz marriage was on the rocks. During the final season from 1959-1960 there was no studio audience, so the laughter you hear is actually a laugh track which is shocking due to the fact they were famous for always using a studio audience. Sadly Ball and Arnaz were constantly fighting on the set so that's when it was decided to not have the audience anymore. Many do not know this but during the filming of the 1959 episode ""The Ricardo's Go to Japan,"" Lucy appeared on camera with red eyes due to extensive crying due to the fact her marriage was falling apart. The Arnaz's were now separated and the day after the filming of ""Lucy Meets the Mustache"" Lucille Ball filed for divorce from Desi Arnaz citing "" irreconcilable differences & extreme mental cruelty."" The final episode aired the following month on April 1st, 1960. There would be no new adventures for the Ricardo's and the Mertz's. This final series is a treasure for ALL Lucy lovers and is a must have!!! All the shows are as funny as ever and with the cast of Lucy, Ricky, Fred, Ethel, and of course Little Ricky along with celebrity guest stars in every episode you cannot go wrong with this amazing buy!! If you love Lucy then you will love them on ""The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show""!!!",1419379200,,2061,4.588075880758808

5185494,5,B008VNI9EW,"I really liked this DVD set. Still, how do you review it? How many 1 hour ongoing situation comedies offhand can you remember? As well is it fair to compare it to the original I Love Lucy? I think not. It's an apples and Oranges comparison. There should almost be a manual present detailing how to go about this daunting task. That said, it's not the continual laughfest the original proved to be but it wasn't limited or restricted to an apartment either. As stated by others all 13 episodes highlight at least 1 big name star some have more. It appears Lucy and Desi had a deal to appear on star's shows like Red Skelton, Milton Berle or Danny Thomas as long as they showed up on the Lucy/Desi Comedy hour. That maneuver really payed off and highlighted these stars in a different kind of way. There are tons of extras from bios of the stars to episode flubs to alternate openings to animation as well as a 38 minute desilu/Westinghouse studio infomercial/skit and more. This hour show has a different feel to it then what's gone before. There are still laughs just more space between them. The sets are more dynamic but the original quartet are still there. There is also a musical element present I think you will enjoy, just one of the advantages of the elongated format. Not every episode is a gem but for the most part they are very good, some better then the original( in my opinion). For me the DVD set is 5 stars without a doubt. Unlike the original, The Lucy/Desi Comedy Hour has hardly been seen on TV since it aired and these are the complete shows. Christmas isn't far off and the season 7-9 set is the perfect gift for anyone familiar with this fine cast!",1414281600,9,1670,4.44299674267101

Knowing that even as they were doing the last of the shows they were filing for divorce is sad.  The last scene of the last Lucy/Desi Comedy Hour where they kiss is sad to watch because it was not ""Lucy"" & ""Ricky"" making up but rather Lucy and Desi saying ""Goodbye"" to the show and to their marriage.  You can see tears in the eyes of both of them.

5185511,4,B008VNI9EW,"While any Lucy is still good, I don't think the Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour was as great as the original I Love Lucy. Some of the episodes were good and others were just ""eh"" and the storyline often felt like it dragged on too long in order to fill the hour-long time slot. Regardless, this DVD set is the only place where you can find the hour-long Lucy episodes, as I don't think they are aired on TV anymore, and the show is filled with guest stars like Tallulah Bankhead, Red Skelton, Maurice Chevalier, and more.

This DVD set includes all 13 hour-long episodes on 4 discs, as well as flubs, behind the scenes notes, guest cast information, original openings and closings, and a 40-minute behind the scenes special. It's definitely worth adding to complete your Lucy collection.

Episodes:

DISC ONE
Lucy Takes A Cruise to Havana- This DVD set includes the original, uncut 75-minute version of the episode where Lucy and her friend Susie (played by Ann Sothern) take a cruise to Havana, Cuba, where Lucy meets Ricky

The Celebrity Next Door- Lucy gets Tallulah Bankhead to appear in a play with her

Lucy Hunts Uranium- The Ricardos and the Mertzes race to see who can claim the uranium faster

DISC TWO
