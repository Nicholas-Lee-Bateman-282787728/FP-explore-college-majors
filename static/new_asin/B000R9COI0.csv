8601378,5,B000R9COI0,"I knew Geopathic stress could cause health problems.  Simply put, Geopathic stress are scientifcally detectable force fields that come from the earth and when some of these fields come together in a home or workplace, for example, they may cause health problems.

What these videos (its a 2-DVD set) do is explain what Geopathic stress does to the human body and some ways to protect against the problem.  There are some medical terms used but for the most part they are explained in laymen's terms. Actually, if you are into alternative health, these videos are fascinating.

What I really liked about it is the videos also talk about basic ways you can test yourself for Geopathic stress and what can be done if you are affected.

Production is not fancy but the information is solid and interesting.",1187827200,3,802,4.824817518248175
