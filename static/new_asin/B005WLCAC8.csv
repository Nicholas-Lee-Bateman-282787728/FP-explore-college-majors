8487984,2,B005WLCAC8,"I decided to watch this documentary and use it as a source for a research paper I am writing about Johnny Appleseed. If you are looking for something containing a lot of information and facts about the subject, stay away from this. However, if you are looking for a film that includes random people telling you what they THINK they know about Johnny, footage of apples on escalators, apples going through revolving doors, and dozens upon dozens of scenes of people eating apples in different settings, look no further!",1468108800,,518,4.831460674157303
8487985,3,B005WLCAC8,"The film often showed an apple rolling along in odd places like on an escalator... on a dashboard.... and elsewhere which I found irritating and amateurish.  However the film did show some interesting facts about Johnny Appleseed.  One interesting subject was the relative of Johnny that inherited his bible.  The film is based on a --;Mother Earth--  sort of world view, rather than a Christian world view and even mentions TAROT cards during one scene!  This was bothersome but not overwhelming and I overlooked it because they quickly got back to the subject of Johnny Appleseed.  The story is shown as a documentary, not as a re-enactment of his life.  It is worth seeing but not a blockbuster show.",1370476800,,703,4.857142857142857
8487986,5,B005WLCAC8,"Really good stuff!  A very insightful and entertaining doc.  I was surprised, as an American, how little I actually knew about Johnny Appleseed.  A very balanced look at his impact on the American landscape.",1332288000,,207,5.029411764705882
8487987,5,B005WLCAC8,"I never knew there was so much to learn about Johnny Appleseed, and I lived in Indiana almost all of my life.  Searching for Johnny is well worth the watch.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Searching-for-Johnny/dp/B006GW4QVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Searching for Johnny</a>",1332288000,,312,7.914285714285715
8487988,5,B005WLCAC8,"cross-cutting of contemporary stories, intertwined with glimpses
of who johnny appleseed was, or who he might have been, works
extremely well for me. with a few factual data at disposal, the film
allows its' picturesque characters to guess, and their projections
into the past are charming and insightful. while learning about
johnny appleseed and his time, we actually learn more about
our present.",1324252800,,399,5.349206349206349
