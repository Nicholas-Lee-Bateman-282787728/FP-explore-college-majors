6201833,3,B00HRYH4TW,Watchable. The plot is standard revenge. The acting not bad and the girls cute. Unfortunately the most attractive has a short part. Only 2 actually strip and those scenes are repeated.,1447891200,7,184,4.967741935483871

6201836,4,B00HRYH4TW,"Having just about exhausted the potential for outrageous ""Shark' films - One must imagine that the folks at Asylum pictures were casting about for other genres to plunder - and hit upon the concept of mimicking the venerable 'Pinky Violence' style films that have long been popular in Japan and other parts of the far East.

In typical Asylum fashion, they managed to get 'some' of it right but the final product definitely feels like it was hastily slapped together (a suposition that is verified in the 'Making Of...' featurette that is included on the disk). However, in this case, that is not necessarily a 'bad thing' due to the fact that most 'true' Asian made Pinky Violence features are also sort of 'thrown together' cheap exploitation affairs.

To their credit (in my warped opinion) Asylum has created a fairly watchable product because they didn't shy away from some nice gratuitous sex & violence and included ample scenes of female nudity within the simplistic 'rape/revenge' plot-line... at least this is the case in the 'UnRated' version!

The story follows the exploits of 4 (you guessed it) Asian Schoolgirls (based in L.A.) who get drugged & raped by a ring of bad guys who, apparently, basically drug and rape schoolgirls.  One of the abused schoolmates kills herself (because of the shame of it all) and her, similarly ravished, buddies determine to avenge her (and themselves) by taking out the organization that assaulted them.  The 'police' are little help so they decide to take matters into their own hands and arm-up with a variety of Western and Eastern style weaponry which they pay for by doing what every underage Asian Schoolgirl knows is the quickest way to earn big bucks - they become strippers. This is good news for the audience as it provides the opportunity for lotsa T&A action as the gurlz begin their vindictive program of pay-back.

In this type of 'film' who really cares if the acting is good or the continuity is spot on - you've got a bunch of cute girls running around in school uniforms and/or less! righteously blowing away their foes.  And that's about 'it'.  What's not to like?!  Personally I found it a great mindless watch & would recommend it to those who enjoy such fare.  The DVD image quality is very crisp/widescreen - extras include a short 'Making Of' segment and a brief 'Gag Reel'.  There's a broad hint at the end of the flik that the 'grrrls might be back' - do I sense the potential for an Asylum Asian Schoolgirl franchise??.... here's hope'n!",1433289600,9,2511,4.789351851851852

6201839,4,B00HRYH4TW,"Four Asian looking high school girls go to a nightclub and get drugged and raped. Suzy (Belle Hengsathorn) does the classical Asian thing and jumps from a building. The remaining three decide to go ""I Spit on Your Grave"" all over their assailants...if they can find them. Hunting them down means working at a strip joint, buying weapons, and learning to fight at night while going to school during the day...and without their parents noticing their absence.

The plot is fairly absurd. While the tattooed girls dress the part, i.e. white shirts, short plaid skirts, they are not the classical Japanese girls who giggle and act shy. This story takes place in L.A. The acting is bad. In one scene the girls are dressed one way and then when the camera returns, they are dressed differently. The first time the girls killed someone, I was laughing out loud, it was so bad.

4 stars for completely all the wrong reasons. Not recommended for serious viewers. It is Asylum.

8635233,4,B00HRYH4TW,"""Asian Schoolgirls"" is like ""I Spit On Your Grave"", if ""I Spit On Your Grave"" were a fun, sexy action movie instead of a disturbing horror movie.
