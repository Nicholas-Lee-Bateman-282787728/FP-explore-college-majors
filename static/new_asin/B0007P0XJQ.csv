2225026,5,B0007P0XJQ,"Yogini Rainbeau Mars, best known for her ""Sacred Yoga Practice"" series, has released a new yoga series titled ""Yoga for Beauty.""  This series offers two practices, Dawn, or the sunrise practice, and Dusk, or the sunset practice.  In both, Rainbeau instructs a class of four participants, this time in an indoor studio (although it is decorated with many plants to suggest the outdoors).  Two of the assistants show modifications, one for limited flexibility and one for limited strength.  While chant-like music plays in the background, Rainbeau offers both live and voiceover instruction:  she speaks live while setting up poses and moving through vinyasas for the first time, but she switches to voiceover while poses are being held.  Her left-right cueing is inconsistent; sometimes she mirror cues, sometimes she does not.  At the beginning and end of both practices, Rainbeau is shown performing a beautiful flow of poses a la Ana Forrest in Strength and Spirit.

The first practice, Dawn, is 44 minutes long and is designed to awaken and energize in the a.m.  It begins in a seated, cross-legged position for a short series of forward bend, side stretch with neck release, and side twist.  Next comes a transition to hands and knees for cat/dog stretches, adding in a lion breath.  From here, you move into down dog and then come into a standing forward bend position to practice what Rainbeau calls ""belly cleansing,"" which is a sort of nauli prep and which is repeated once.  Then you move to the front of the mat for sun salutations:  three half sun salutations, one round of sun salutation A with crescent lunge and an easy twist, then two rounds of sun salutation B, repeating crescent lunge and adding warrior one plus a crescent twist (cobras are subbed for upward dog in all versions).  A final sun salutation B adds an airplane balance plus a fun transition to a simple seat twist before; you then move to lying to lie face down on the floor for some gentle backbends, including full cobra, spinx with a quad stretch, bow pose, and then child's pose to release the back.  Coming seated, you perform a forward bend and cobbler's pose before double-folding your blanket under your back like a bolster for a supported final relaxation which includes a meditation on colors.  The practice ends back in a seated position, with Rainbeau encouraging you to honor your work and touch your mind's eye before coming into namaste.

The second practice, Dusk, is 45 minutes long and is designed for relaxation and release at the end of the day, mainly through hip opening and core work.  The practice starts in savasana; you begin to focus on your core via both breathing and simple movement.  After rolling into a seated position, you stretch in child's pose, move into downward dog, and transition into 3-legged downward dog for a hip stretch.  Returning to core work, you move into a face-down lying position and raise alternate arm and leg; you then do the same thing from a hands and knees position, adding a knee to nose stretch and then finally performing the same knee to nose stretch in down dog.  Next comes two round of sun salutation B, the first with warrior one and the second pyramid pose plus several lunge variations to stretch the hips.  Transitioning to seated position for more hip work, you perform seated pigeon, rock the cradle, boat, and then thread the needle in a reclined position; there are also a few additional core-strengthening moves.  You then grab your blanket for shoulderstand:  starting in plow, you raise into shoulderstand, hold for an extended period, lower back into plow, and then roll back down.  A brief lying twist to release the back precedes a nice savasana, and then it's back to seated to finish with namaste.

I really enjoyed both of these practices and look forward to doing them often.  Although there are modifications shown, I don't think these practices would be appropriate to those brand-new to yoga, but experienced beginners and beyond should be fine.  I probably preferred the Dawn practice a bit more; although I loved the hip opening work in Dusk, the tough core work was a bit more challenging than I'd ideally want from a relaxing evening practice.  Overall, however, these are well thought out, well executed, and well produced yoga practices, and I would highly recommend the set.",1113696000,6,4350,4.872282608695652
2225057,5,B0007P0XJQ,"I've really enjoyed both these DVDs. There are so many great reviews describing what's on them, so I will just add that Rainbeau is a wonderful, inspiring teacher. Also, these DVDs are enough of a challenge for more experienced people and there are modifications for beginners. I'm very happy to own them and always look forward to my sessions doing them. I think anyone would enjoy them.",1246665600,,388,4.8059701492537314
2225058,2,B0007P0XJQ,Starts out easy but quickly switches to poses and movements too hard for beginners.  I've done these two dvds several times and am unable to do the entire hour. I like the dusk dvd better...but still would not have bought this video if I could have reviewed it first.,1243641600,3,267,4.448979591836735
2225059,5,B0007P0XJQ,"I have been doing many different kinds of Yoga for over eight years now.  I have been using these two videos for over three months now and have found that I am more energized, and have increased my flexibility.  I do not know if I can attribute my skin improvements to these two videos, but I have received comments on how good my skin looks.  The physical work is very calming and a workout at the same time.  Really love it!",1240272000,,426,4.222222222222222
2225060,3,B0007P0XJQ,"I like to use this DVD when I'm not quite up for the challenge of intense yoga practices. It is invigorating and energizing yet very gentle. The instructor, Rainbeau Mars has a very relaxing style and pleasant personality.",1229212800,,222,4.868421052631579
2225061,5,B0007P0XJQ,"Very nice mellow workouts using dawn that gets my morning moving. Dusk is a great way to stretch, I get a great night sleep with this one.",1223164800,,138,4.148148148148148
2225062,5,B0007P0XJQ,"I absolutely LOVE these DVDs. Rainbeau Mars is an excellent instructor. The DVDs include narration by Rainbeau while doing the asanas, as well as background narration, reminding you to breathe, let go into the pose, etc. Also included are modifications to the poses which are demonstrated by other participants. The asanas are challenging, but not as challenging as the Pure Power & Pure Sweat DVDs by Rainbeau and can definitely be done by beginners.

After completing the workout, I truly feel centered and appreciate her narration reminding me to be thankful for being able to practice yoga and to realize the benefits of the asanas while I am practicing.",1221868800,,658,5.036697247706422
2225063,5,B0007P0XJQ,By FAR this is my favorite yoga instructor now. I love this series. I feel stronger and healthier adding Raibeau's yoga for beauty dvd's to my fitness program. I'm going into my third trimester and can easily modify the poses. I also will be able to use the dvd's after I have the baby since they aren't pregnancy specific poses. These dvd's are definately worth a lot more than I paid. I could see a beginner through intermediate equally being able to see themselves challenged in them. Love them!,1220313600,,498,4.606741573033708
2225064,3,B0007P0XJQ,"The program over all was fine, but Rainbeau Mars needs to work on her instruction techniques.  I was also surprised with her 'affirmations' which seemed stuttering nor memorized. It was also strange to see an instructor adjusting her hair throughout a lesson.
However, I did find the program itself okay.",1213315200,5,304,5.08
2225065,4,B0007P0XJQ,"These workouts are both pretty well paced for beginners. The poses are held for a decent amount of time, aren't too difficult for the flexibility challenged and the instructions are adequate if you already have some yoga experience.

The only problem I will have with these DVD's over time is that she does things like flip her hair, and at times ceases giving instruction, so that when you look at the TV everyone else has moved beyond what you were doing.

She is also too chatty, saying things like ""when you have a pet, and you give it a lot of love, it becomes happy. This is what we want to do with our bodies"". After you hear that a dozen times, it gets old. She also has one sequence where she says ""I have this thing I like to do where I kiss my toes - kiss!"" then she repeats that on the other side as well. The guys in the class are clearly pretending that just isn't happening.

I gave this four stars because it mostly has a good flow to it, and I love all the hip openers (except for the toe kissing) that she does on the Dusk DVD.",1212192000,5,1045,4.137931034482759
2225066,4,B0007P0XJQ,"I was looking for a dvd to supplement yoga classes, and my teacher recommended Rainbeau Mars. This set was a good choice for me, with one dvd each for beginning or ending my day. She teaches the names of the poses and why they are good for the body. It's an enjoyable workout experience.",1203897600,2,287,4.333333333333333
2225067,5,B0007P0XJQ,I love this product.. it is challenging enough to be a very serious workout while also being incredibly meditiative for such a challenge.  I was thrilled and intend to buy many more of Rainbeau's products,1202947200,,204,4.828571428571428
2225068,5,B0007P0XJQ,"I just started Yoga and have been trying many of the Yoga for Beginner discs out there.  I ordered this set after doing Yoga for a couple months hoping to find some new poses to challenge me some more.  I'm very pleased with the purchase and would recommend the disc set to anyone who's looking for something along the lines of beginner/intermediate exercises.  She has multiple people with her in this set which allows you to follow the person based on your skill level which I found useful.

One thing this disc does and I wish many more of them did this is when you end your practice many of them instruct you to slow your breathing and relax on the floor for several minutes but then seconds after they say this, the DVD switches to some annoying advertisement about other discs you can buy (not very relaxing and actually quite disruptive).  This disc however actually DOES go on for several minutes afterwards with soothing music allowing you to actually relax.  And...if you feel like watching during this time, you will realize that you will most likely be able to learn further from Rainbeau as she moves from advanced pose to advanced pose.  It's amazing to watch.

This was not a completely blind purchase as I own one of her other discs and I'm happy with this one as well.",1195257600,,1285,4.556521739130435
2225069,5,B0007P0XJQ,"Both of these DVD's contain 45 minute practices.  There are also bonus workouts on each of the DVD's that are about 15 minutes long that are great if you're in a rush.  The full length DVD's are more than just workouts, they combine mind, body, and soul.  You definitely get the exercise and come away toned, but you also come away with a more positive sense of self and less stress.  Rainbeau has a very positive way of teaching both poses and respect for your body.  She is an amazing instructor.",1184371200,,498,4.428571428571429
2225070,5,B0007P0XJQ,"Both practices take about 45 minutes, with an additional bonus section in the dvd special features.  The Dawn practice focuses on arms and legs, energizing the body, while the Dusk practice focuses on core work.  The flowing vinyasas are perfectly paced for me, as I prefer to move through poses slower than some of the more 'power vinyasa' practices available.

My main criticism is that Rainbeau Mars isn't consistent in her cues--sometimes she mirrors and other times not.  There are 4 people who practice with her, 2 who follow her exactly, 1 who modifies for less flexible people, and 1 who modifies for people with less strength.  All in all, these are two excellent practices and I look forward to more dvds from Rainbeau Mars.",1171670400,3,734,4.84
2225071,5,B0007P0XJQ,"Just a quick shout-out for Rainbeau's most recent set of discs.  These are not intense (less so than her Sacred Yoga set), but they are deeply soothing and will wake up and challenge your body.  I'm embarrassed to say I thought these were specifically targeted toward women (and maybe they are) but the sessions are gender neutral and well worth doing for anyone.  In each case the title of the session gives you an idea when best to do it.  The morning session is a genuine wake-up (hence the name Dawn) and the Dusk session is suited for just that time (it may be a little too vigorous right before bed).  Rainbeau is an outstanding teacher who beautifully weaves together the physical and spiritual elements of yoga for an immediately healing experience.",1168128000,,757,4.704545454545454
2225072,4,B0007P0XJQ,"Rainbeau does this in a beautiful studio w/2 women & 2 men, 1 man & woman showing modifications. The music's beautiful chanting is different, but the tempo is almost sleepy, too slow for a workout to relax you. This DVD has great menu options such letterbox or full screen choice, dolby digital 2.0 or 5.1, gallery of pictures, workout w/o sound & a beautiful about 4 min solo performance of Rainbeau showing how advanced she is. There are also trailers for her previous DVDs: vinyasa flow, Dawn, Zen mama, as well as for yoga for wimps & Lilias series for the people who want a mature instructor.

Dr. Beth did a great job with telling you about the poses which do contain several hip openers I don't often see which is great. The pace is very slow with a lot of moutain pose & child pose resting which seemed to take up a huge chunk of the program. It would have been better if she did more simple stretches instead such as butterfly. It is a good workout, but the 3 legged lifting & warriors seemed a bit much for trying to relax yourself to me. I will use this more on slow rainy days when I'm not up for something more strenueous.
The only thing I noticed was her speaking, I used to LOVE it on her previous DVDs, but this time it seemed disjointed/hurried unllike in the past relaxed/flowing. Even her dawn was good/fine, only this one didn't flow right. What she still does is great is let you know what the poses help you do, such as hip openers help you to release toxins that tend to build in that area & the modified handstand (you still on your upper back & forearms, not hard) help bring back the blood to the heart & help blood flow to increase to cleanse the toxins from the blood which you just releases.

There is a bonus 10 min workout including 2 min laying down & cross legged rest at the end. She speaks a little more relaxed here. Starts with child's pose, downward dog, 3 legged down dog & knee to chest several times, wide-leged squat, down dog, standing foward bend, moutain, plank, upward dog/cobra, down dog, 3 lgged down dog & knee to chest agian, down dog, standing fwd bend, chair/powerful pose, stand fwd bend, plank, upward dog, down dog, boat, holding body up with hands, boat, quick handstand, upward dog, down dog, laying down knee to chest several times, laying down spinal twist, bridge & bridge w/1 leg up, resting pigeon hold & rest.

This dvd is not good as a 1st dvd on yoga, but maybe a 3 or 4th becasue of both the harder poses & lack of detailed instruction on foot placement & body weight distribution which is needed at first. The dawn one I would recommend first over this one.",1157414400,4,2624,4.383983572895278
2225073,5,B0007P0XJQ,"I have all of Rainbeau's DVDs.  This particular set is considerably easier than the Pure Sweat and Pure Power.  As an avid yoga practitioner, I would only reach for these DVDs if I were looking for something easy.  The thing that I love about all of her workouts, though, is the way she uses imagery to help you visualize what you are doing in the pose.  I find it really helpful.

In any case, despite the fact that I find these videos easy, they always leave me in a very good mood.  In fact, because it leaves me so happy and well-balanced, I bought this set for my friend who had never done yoga before.  Before her roommate promptly stole it, my friend said that it very tough and thoroughly enjoyable.  (She plans to steal it back.)

Whether you are a beginner or more experienced, you need Rainbeau Mars in your life.  Also, the performance at the end (which is the same on both videos), is truly beautiful and amazing.",1146009600,6,926,4.394117647058824
2225074,5,B0007P0XJQ,I've been doing these two work outs for a year now and I still love them!  Sometimes Rainbeau gets confused on which side is left and which is right but it doesn't happen enough to confuse you.  She does this solo performance at the end of the yoga practice that is super inspirational.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who likes to see and feel results from their yoga session.,1145059200,2,383,4.366197183098592
2225075,5,B0007P0XJQ,"I love these dvds.  Rainbeau Mars is one of my favorite instructors, so I was really exited when these came out.  'Dawn' is a really invigorating practice that helps to get you blood flowing and get centered and focused for your day.  Dusk is a more relaxing restorative practice.  There is an amazing hip opening segment in Dusk that really releases all the stored tension.  Rainbeau Mars is such a compassionate and warm instructor.  Her cuing and instruction are very clear, so you don't need to always be looking up at the screen.  These two dvds are a must!",1144972800,5,562,4.616161616161616
2225076,5,B0007P0XJQ,"I like the pace of the workout.  Not too difficult, but challenging enough to feel results.  I really liked the meditations she gives about gaining health and beauty.  I would prefer it to set outside instead of inside.  But, other than that, it was great!",1142812800,3,256,4.622222222222222
2225097,4,B0007P0XJQ,"Rainbeau Mars has created a very interesting and original intermediate yoga workout.  Although the program includes two people doing modifications, one for limited flexibility and one for limited strength, this is not in any way a workout for beginners.  Rainbeau moves from posture to posture in her usual flow style with minimal instruction on posture and breathing.

I found it to be engaging and challenging, but I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because there are no twists in the workout and I think the program would have benefitted by including some of these to balance the other wise excellent hip-opening and ab-strengthening workout.

A work of caution: I found the background eastern music and vocals to be distracting.  Even more distracting is the way Rainbeau constantly flips her head back to clear her hair out of the way, uses her hands to the same and unconsciously rubs her nose thoughout the program.",1142726400,4,914,4.909090909090909
2225098,5,B0007P0XJQ,"I bought this along with Sara Ivanhoe's 20 Min Yoga Makeover (made by the same company I believe).  In comparison to other yoga dvds I've viewed-- I really like this company's creations*

This set was relaxing--  The instructor guides your movements sometimes-- and when you are not looking at the screen, there is a detailed narration voice that I found really useful.

For beginners, there is someone in the back that shows you how to use your tools (blocks in particular..) --

These sets are about an hour long--  I like that .. but if I were only buying one set, I'd probably stick to the 20 min sets because sometimes I just don't have the time... but these dvds were Really nice....  Highly recommended.",1130716800,10,710,4.632
2225099,5,B0007P0XJQ,"I have been practicing yoga daily for 9 years now, and I own 30 to 40 yoga videos and DVDs, including those of Shiva Rea, Patricia Walden, Tracey Rich, Seane Corn, and others.  Let me just say that Rainbeau Mars' ""Yoga for Beauty"" has EASILY made it into my top 5 favorites.  First of all, do not worry about the word ""Beauty"" in her title.  Rainbeau's definition of Beauty is in no way shallow or superficial.  (""Breathe in Self-Love, Breathe out Self-Doubt"".)  Instead, Rainbeau made an impression on me that she is in-tune with nature, is glowing, radiant, and happy to be alive, and she fully wishes only the best for all her students.  She is obviously extremely adept in yoga, and she makes for an excellent yoga instructor, teaching precise alignment, and challenging the student while always showing how to practice modifications for those of us still working on our flexibility and strength.  I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD and am on my way to buying more of her dvds, simply because I fully enjoy practicing yoga with her! -Nicole",1120780800,23,1045,4.772222222222222
2225100,5,B0007P0XJQ,"An excellent set of Yoga DVDs, if there is only one DVD you would buy I would recommend this.
The Dawn series focuses on Core, while the Dusk on the Hips. Smooth progression of excerises allowing it to be used for  Begineer and Intermediate level practise. The choice of Asanas is excellent, there is enough focus on the modifications for everyone to follow.
The music blends in well.

Level: Beginner and Intermediate+
Instructions: Spoken and Voiceover
Modifications: Shown who the flexibility challenged and strength challenged
Location: Studio
Music: Indian instrumental and hums.
Props Needed: Two blankets. For those modifying: Blocks for Dusk and Excerise Band for Dawn.
Duration: 45 minutes each",1119830400,20,703,5.324324324324325
2225101,5,B0007P0XJQ,"I recently purchased the new Dawn/Dusk yoga series. All I can say is wow. The practice is a wonderful combination of challenging poses and learning to breathe into your body and let go of all tensions. As someone who is trying to let go in my life, I can honestly say that Rainbeau's yoga is a key element in achieving that goal. Her mantras and ""yoga language"" are inspiring and so very relaxing. I truly recommend this series to anyone who wants to improve their yoga practice and learn how to let go and be still with yourself.",1116460800,10,530,4.418367346938775
2225102,5,B0007P0XJQ,"Even though I've been practicing yoga for a while now and have also bought a few video tapes, this was my first one with Ms. Mars and I have to admit I immediately became one of her heaps of admirers.

It is a wonderful evening practice with great cues for the not-only-beginning practicioner and enough emphasis on relaxation (which you can certainly continue at the end if you feel like it and which most of the tapes I own lacks) and flexibility, yet a few challenging poses, so that those of us that want to feel like they HAVE done some workout even after a yoga practice, will feel satisfied as well.

So, even if it is a somewhat challenging workout for the body, I felt relaxed, happy and beautiful at the end.

Highly recommended!",1115596800,,739,4.45925925925926
2225103,5,B0007P0XJQ,"This review is not necessarily about the 58 and 50 poses (which were absoultely amazing) Rainbeau introduces, it is about the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical benefits. The prayers performed before and after the workouts are so uplifting. The studio is amazing.  The use of colors in the studio--along with the mural background and lit fireplace--makes working out pleasurable and comfortable.  It is important to be reminded that Rainbeau's past workout were performed alone, outside near the ocean (which is breathtaking).  It is a change but a good change.

She includes people (2 females and 2 males) from different cultures to illustrate the wonderful yoga poses. She also communicates with her cast as she demonstrates the poses--giving good eye contact and continual smiles. Each person demonstrates each level of the workout.  This means if you are a beginner, intermediate for advanced person, you will not be disappointed.

I recommend using both DVDs (Dawn and Dusk)on the same day.  Dawn gets me extremely energized with uplifing moods and Dusk gets me prepared for a relaxing evening.  After performing the Dusk Dvd, I am so relaxed I am actually sleepy when retiring to bed. Gettting up during the night appears to be a condition of my past. Now, I look forward to rest--which is not usual for me.  I awake ready and refreshed for the day ahead and extremely hungry.  Skipping breakfast is no longer an option.

I practice yoga 3 times a week now that I perform Dawn and Dusk on the same day. My attitude, breathing, posture and energy level is improving daily. My clothes are starting to become loose as well (especially around my mid section).  I recommend Yoga for Beauty with Rainbeau Mars-2 Volume Gift set to anyone who wants a challenge or as Rainbeau says just wants to breathe.

I FEEL MORE AT PEACE AND FOCUSED. THIS IS YOGA FOR MY INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SELF.

Thank you Rainbeau.  I find Vinyasa yoga to be very useful.  Hope you are working to your next series.  I do not want to give away the entire video but yes, there is more the the video than the workout.  You have to buy it to find out more.",1114732800,32,2134,4.768392370572207
2225104,4,B0007P0XJQ,"Yogini Rainbeau Mars, best known for her ""Sacred Yoga Practice"" series, has released a new yoga series titled ""Yoga for Beauty,"" and I recently tried the VHS version.  This series offers two practices, Dawn, or the sunrise practice, and Dusk, or the sunset practice. In both, Rainbeau instructs a class of four participants, this time in an indoor studio (although it is decorated with many plants to suggest the outdoors). Two of the assistants show modifications, one for limited flexibility and one for limited strength, although I would recommend some prior experience with yoga.  While chant-like music plays in the background, Rainbeau offers both live and voiceover instruction: she speaks live while setting up poses and moving through vinyasas for the first time, but she switches to voiceover while poses are being held. Her left-right cueing is inconsistent; sometimes she mirror cues, sometimes she does not. At the beginning and end of both practices, Rainbeau is shown performing a beautiful flow of poses a la Ana Forrest in Strength and Spirit.

The evening practice, Dusk, is 45 minutes long and is designed for relaxation and release at the end of the day, mainly through hip opening and core work. The practice starts in savasana; you begin to focus on your core via both breathing and simple movement. After rolling into a seated position, you stretch in child's pose, move into downward dog, and transition into 3-legged downward dog for a hip stretch. Returning to core work, you move into a face-down lying position and raise alternate arm and leg; you then do the same thing from a hands and knees position, adding a knee to nose stretch and then finally performing the same knee to nose stretch in down dog. Next comes two round of sun salutation B, the first with warrior one and the second pyramid pose plus several lunge variations to stretch the hips. Transitioning to seated position for more hip work, you perform seated pigeon, rock the cradle, boat, and then thread the needle in a reclined position; there are also a few additional core-strengthening moves. You then grab your blanket for shoulderstand: starting in plow, you raise into shoulderstand, hold for an extended period, lower back into plow, and then roll back down. A brief lying twist to release the back precedes a nice savasana, and then it's back to seated to finish with namaste.

I really enjoyed this practice and look forward to doing it often. I especially loved the hip opening work, although the tough core work was a bit more challenging than I'd ideally want from a relaxing evening practice. Overall, however, this video is well thought out, well executed, and well produced, and I would highly recommend it.",1113782400,10,2718,4.953947368421052

The practice ends back in a seated position, with Rainbeau encouraging you to honor your work and touch your mind's eye before coming into namaste.

The second practice, Dusk, is 45 minutes long and is designed for relaxation and release at the end of the day, mainly through hip opening and core work. The practice starts in savasana; you begin to focus on your core via both breathing and simple movement. After rolling into a seated position, you stretch in child's pose, move into downward dog, and transition into 3-legged downward dog for a hip stretch. Returning to core work, you move into a face-down lying position and raise alternate arm and leg; you then do the same thing from a hands and knees position, adding a knee to nose stretch and then finally performing the same knee to nose stretch in down dog. Next comes two round of sun salutation B, the first with warrior one and the second pyramid pose plus several lunge variations to stretch the hips. Transitioning to seated position for more hip work, you perform seated pigeon, rock the cradle, boat, and then thread the needle in a reclined position; there are also a few additional core-strengthening moves. You then grab your blanket for shoulderstand: starting in plow, you raise into shoulderstand, hold for an extended period, lower back into plow, and then roll back down. A brief lying twist to release the back precedes a nice savasana, and then it's back to seated to finish with namaste.

I really enjoyed both of these practices and look forward to doing them often. Although there are modifications shown, I don't think these practices would be appropriate to those brand-new to yoga, but experienced beginners and beyond should be fine. I probably preferred the Dawn practice a bit more; although I loved the hip opening work in Dusk, the tough core work was a bit more challenging than I'd ideally want from a relaxing evening practice. Overall, however, these are well thought out, well executed, and well produced yoga practices, and I would highly recommend the set.",1113782400,69,4350,4.874324324324324
2225106,4,B0007P0XJQ,"Yogini Rainbeau Mars, best known for her ""Sacred Yoga Practice"" series, has released a new yoga series titled ""Yoga for Beauty.""  This series offers two practices, Dawn, or the sunrise practice, and Dusk, or the sunset practice.  In both, Rainbeau instructs a class of four participants, this time in an indoor studio (although it is decorated with many plants to suggest the outdoors).  Two of the assistants show modifications, one for limited flexibility and one for limited strength.  While chant-like music plays in the background, Rainbeau offers both live and voiceover instruction:  she speaks live while setting up poses and moving through vinyasas for the first time, but she switches to voiceover while poses are being held.  Her left-right cueing is inconsistent; sometimes she mirror cues, sometimes she does not.  At the beginning and end of both practices, Rainbeau is shown performing a beautiful flow of poses a la Ana Forrest in Strength and Spirit.

The evening practice, Dusk, is 45 minutes long and is designed for relaxation and release at the end of the day, mainly through hip opening and core work.  The practice starts in savasana; you begin to focus on your core via both breathing and simple movement.  After rolling into a seated position, you stretch in child's pose, move into downward dog, and transition into 3-legged downward dog for a hip stretch.  Returning to core work, you move into a face-down lying position and raise alternate arm and leg; you then do the same thing from a hands and knees position, adding a knee to nose stretch and then finally performing the same knee to nose stretch in down dog.

8049820,5,B0007P0XJQ,"I know the basics of yoga but I'm not super strong and can't do a lot of the advanced poses in yoga. I've been to a number of studio classes, but they are costly and it's a lot more feasible for me to buy DVDs and do them at home. I like that this set offers variations for different needs, so I can do what suits my mood or flexibility on a given day. With any yoga, it is what you make it. The Dawn DVD is a little easier and more relaxing. It focuses on heart and shoulder openers. The Dusk DVD is a little more intense in that it involves more strength training and abs with a focus on hip openers. The Dusk DVD is my favorite yoga DVD so far (I've tried ~10). I like the 10 min ""bonus workout"" on the Dawn DVD. It's a great workout to do when you want to do a little something but are short on time. I definitely recommend the set, but if you decide to just get one, I'd suggest Dusk.",1366416000,,889,3.89010989010989

8049822,4,B0007P0XJQ,"I had first started dabbling in yoga when I was feeling very stressed from work and school and needed to feel some relaxation. Working out has always destressed me, but yoga always seemed interesting. So, there were many different types of yoga videos to try on my On Demand and Rainbeau Mars' Beauty for the AM was one of them. I, in no way, feel like a yoga expert and have only been practicing for less than a year. But this is my personal opinion about this DVD set. I was looking for a way to relax and actually learn something about the practices of yoga. With that, I wanted to strengthen and condition, but was not looking for a cardio or fat burning work out. Rainbeau does exactly that. She gets the viewer in touch with themselves and their breathing and explains each pose and variations of it simply. She adds statements that help you focus and understand the important points of how and why you practice yoga. For me, it took a few watches to do the poses correctly. After you nail the poses, each time you do them will make you feel better, inside and out.

Some poses are harder than others. I truly feel that doing this a couple times of week has helped me strengthen all types of muscles and my core and made me more flexible and relaxed. Also - Dusk and Dawn do exactly as they promise. Dawn, with its lights and colors and music along with the poses really help me to wake up and open up to the world and getting energized. Dusk, with softer lighting and music really help my mind and body prepare to sleep easily and relax itself while still getting fulfilling exercise and strength.

This is my favorite yoga instructor thus far and DVD set that I believe I can use for the rest of my life. The only critique I can give is that this DVD is not for a heavy, fast paced workout. It focusing on slow movements that build your strength and endurance and use your core to the fullest. I still break a sweat during both DVDs. It also has a shorter bonus workout with harder moves and no instruction.",1297123200,3,2015,4.342175066312997
8049823,5,B0007P0XJQ,"If you are looking for a DVD to try out yoga and see if you like it, then get this right away! I was lucky enough to catch Rainbeau on Exercise TV. I loved her energy and positivity so much, she is a great instructor. The music in this is very therapeutic, too. I work out all the time, and I found it fun, yet still challenging. Great way to spend some time in the evening by myself. I've tried other yoga programs, and I could never get into it. I really think if I had not found this, I would have never continued with yoga at all.

But as I replied to someone on here, yoga is HARD. A lot of people make the mistake of thinking that yoga is an easy ""soccer mom"" kind of exercise program if they are out of shape. I think yoga is something you can only appreciate if you start off in shape. It takes a lot of strength to hold the positions and actually enjoy them instead of sweating in pain the whole time. If you are looking for a straight beginner workout to get you in shape, I recommend ENVY Girls. That always works for me.",1296172800,2,1032,4.034146341463415
