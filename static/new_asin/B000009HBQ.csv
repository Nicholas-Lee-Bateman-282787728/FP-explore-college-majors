7905414,5,B000009HBQ,"I saw this movie a long time ago, probably around 1997, but I thought it was highly entertaining with amazing acrobatic kung fu. The fighting among the women in this movie was awesome particularly that of Joyce Mina Godenzi, wife of Sammo Hung. Yuen Biao in this movie was particularly interesting and fun to watch as he imagines himself to be a legendary Chinese swordsman. I saw this movie after I saw Jet Li's ""Swordsman II"" and I still liked this movie.... Anyway, see this film whenever you get the chance, I think you'll enjoy seeing it.",998265600,,543,4.608247422680412
7905415,2,B000009HBQ,"I found this to be a pretty disjointed movie. It features the lovely Joyce Godenzi (Eastern Condors) as a professional thief from a long line of thieves. She is betrayed by a colleague and goes to prison. When released  she attempts to go straight, but is talked into assisting the police in  apprehending her betrayer, who now leads her own criminal  gang.
Actor/Martial Artist/Acrobat Yuen Biao (Project A) has a minor role  as the Police Chief's (Richard Ng) nephew, a young man obsessed with  ""Swordsman"" novels. He also imagines himself to be a crime  fighter. Actually, all Yuen Biao really manages to do is get himself in the  middle of most situations and complicate them. he does manage to help save  the day towards the end of the movie.
The plotlines are hard to follow  and the subtitling is difficult to read at times. I would only recommend  this movie if you like watching women match martial arts skills against one  another, and even then I would not classify this as a ""Martial  Arts"" movie. If you like Joyce Godenzi you will enjoy this movie.  Although listed as starring Yuen Biao, his role in the movie ia a minor  one.",964051200,,1141,4.64
