3480829,5,B001B3LIQ0,"This is an excellent presentation of forgotten trains as we travel the length of Britton and Ireland in two rail journeys, in 1980 and in 1994. We travel through time.

Chapters:
CONFESSIONS OF A TRAIN SPOTTER
DERRY TO KERRY

One of the fun things is even of the trains look a tad antique so does this presentation with old time technology and even cameras with film. The landscape that the trains go through is breath taking. We also are entertained with old stories of trains and their surroundings. We get to see the Dublin National Library and other hot spots as Michael Palin looks for his ancestors.",1401494400,3,605,4.644859813084112
3480830,5,B001B3LIQ0,"I watched and taped this program when it originally aired in the early 1980s. As a fan of trains (and all rail transport), I literally wore out the VHS tape from overuse! I realized that what was most appealling was not only the great cinematography and witty presentation by Michael Palin but the beautiful and haunting music by Ian Lynn. He masterfully matches the music to the movement of trains and landscape scenery.",1257724800,8,421,4.780821917808219
3480831,3,B001B3LIQ0,"Hemingway Adventure:  Quite different from the other Palin series I've seen (80 Days, Full Circle, Himalaya).  Less of the point-to-point urgency in this one, and as a result it's more relaxed; and he goofs around more.  There's some pretty funny stuff here.  I just got through reading Hemingway's ""Sun Also Rises"" so it was good timing and interesting to see some of the sights and so forth.  Overall pretty good, but some parts I found rather dull.  Much prefer Full Circle and some of the others.

Great Railway Journeys:  Mostly this is for train fiends.  I watched a bit of it but then bailed.",1233446400,8,599,4.6826923076923075
3480832,4,B001B3LIQ0,"Interesting semi-biography on Hemmingway; an up-close view of places where he wrote and what he wrote about.  Lots of laughs in between.
Older (25 years ago?) look at Ireland and great treat for train buffs.",1225843200,8,207,4.914285714285715
3480833,5,B001B3LIQ0,"Both the Hemingway and Train Spotter docs are wonderful. I saw both of these on PBS when they were first aired, and I am very happy that they are finally getting a DVD release.  The Train Spotter documentary was available earlier on a very hard to find VHS.

Get them while they last!",1222819200,6,284,4.339622641509434
