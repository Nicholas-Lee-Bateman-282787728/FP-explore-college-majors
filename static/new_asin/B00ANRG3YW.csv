8554823,4,B00ANRG3YW,"I enjoyed this film, even if I have to admit that its pacing tiresomely sags at times. Perhaps the constant switching between one moment of Heleno de Freita's life and another is a good thing, since the film conceivably could have had such lapses even more frequently. Fortunately, whether portraying Heleno in the peak of health and athletic form during his soccer stardom, or as Heleno physically is deteriorating from syphilis, Rodrigo Santoro, a very handsome and leanly fit man, is fascinating alike in appearance and acting to view even in this 2011 film's black and white photography. How such a great-looking guy so convincingly can portray the disease-wracked invalid who Heleno becomes, it is almost impossible to imagine anyone else doing better.

The leading ladies in this film are massively gorgeous, too, which does no harm at all!

There are not many scenes of Heleno de Freitas out on the soccer field. The motion picture rather concentrates on Heleno's personal life, on his often abrasively macho, pugnacious relations with other players and, really, with all and sundry alike, and on Heleno's swings in health and physical condition. An elegiac quality overtakes the film as it proceeds that is rather rare in sports movies, but, hey, that is one of the aspects of this film, among many, which make it so special.

The DVD edition viewed is that of Screen Media (8-1483-80125-1-3). The English subtitles are well handled, furtunately not intruding unduly on the screen image. There are no bonus features, although any future edition that might come along with such extras to help viewers, soccer lovers or others, to understand more about Heleno de Freitas, would be welcome, if ever such an augmented edition appear.

Lovely film!",1496966400,,1751,5.069444444444445
8554824,2,B00ANRG3YW,"When this blu-ray was released, the description made it sound like a tempting pick. It promised to tell the story of a real life sports superstar from the late 40s whose lifestyle destroys him. I didn't know anything about Heleno de Freitas, nor soccer nor Portuguese. Adventuresome, I like to watch movies from all over the world. The price of the blu-ray was a bargain for a new release, so how could I miss. Well ...

Its not a new material, of course. Simply told, it could be presented in a standard chronological manner or, it could start in the present, and through flashbacks, tell us how the main character started out, how he rose and how he caused his downfall; cliched, but tried and true.

Presented in a 2:35 wide screen ratio, in black and white, with barely legible yellow subtitles, the film has slick production values. It boasts an attractive and talented cast, a fun period recreation and good cinematography, but the script is all wrong. It starts out in the present (where the soccer player is in a hospital in an advanced stage of syphilis) and goes back to the midpoint in the story. Were not told anything about his background, his childhood (he talks to his mother on the phone once - she is off screen), or how he rose to fame. Instead, we see him as a successful and charismatic jerk, bedding beautiful women, driving fast cars, getting drunk and unruly, sniffing what I suppose was ether, and picking fights with the entire supporting cast. There does not seem to be the slightest intention of understanding or compassion on the part of the writers, so you end up watching almost two solid hours of repetitious scenes where the character is so obnoxious you keep hoping someone will drive a stake through his heart. This treatment goes also for other characters. The actress playing the nightclub singer Heleno de Freitas gets involved with makes a sexational entrance. Made up and gowned to look like Hayworth in Gilda, she sets the screen on fire singing the old torch song, Frenes. But she sings this song five or six times (I lost count), not as a recurring flashback, but every time she has a turn in front of the mike. Was this due to a lack of imagination, or were the producers not able to afford rights for other ditties? Who knows.  As to the handsome leading man, he gives his all, but is ultimately defeated by a tiresome script that simply goes in circles with not an iota of insight to be had, hopelessly stuck in the role of a psychotic lout with not one single redeeming quality. What audience were the film makers thinking of I have no idea. After about an hour of this, I was hitting the Fast-Forward button on my Remote with increasing frequency A pity and a disappointment: they had a good story, but they blew it.",1451088000,,2763,4.5777777777777775

8554829,4,B00ANRG3YW,Rodrigo Santoro plays the soccer star with depth and grace.  I would give it 5 stars if I could separate the artistry of the production and the incredible acting from the way it made me feel.  This is a movie that could haunt you for weeks.,1366848000,,240,4.195652173913044
