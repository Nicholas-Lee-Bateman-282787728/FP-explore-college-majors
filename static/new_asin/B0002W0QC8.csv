8033486,5,B0002W0QC8,"This video (dispite haveing a new age theme) is a little rough(Cohen doesn't seam scripted at all) yet straight forward approach to learning the basics of this system. Cohen covers basic staces, blocks, take downs and more; first slowly telling how the waza(move) is preformed, then showing how he would preform them, (with out a partner and in a slow motion) then at full speed with an attacker. He seams to know what he is doeing and God bless him for helping the rest of us.",1182902400,,477,4.558139534883721
