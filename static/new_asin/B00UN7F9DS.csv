8707531,5,B00UN7F9DS,"Reputed to be the best jazz performance ever on TV, this is simply an amazing chance to see some of the greatest jazz musicians ever on video, which considering the quality of the source material, is wonderfully watchable.  Red Allen's version of ""Rosetta,"" with Coleman Hawkins playing, Billie Holiday's ""Fine and Mellow,"" with Lester Young and Coleman Hawkins both playing solos, and Jimmy Rushing & Count Basie's ""I Left My Baby"" are particular favorites and I get chills watching the actual performance!  Plus, the original studio album is also included, in higher bit and sampling.  Also included are bonus extras from other TV shows of the time, including the only known video of Charlie Parker (from 1952, playing with Dizzy Gillespie).  If you are a jazz fan, this is an absolute ""must have.""",1453593600,,800,4.992481203007519
8707532,5,B00UN7F9DS,"When I initially ordered the blu-ray of Robert Herridge's ""The Sound of Jazz"", I had to wonder -- what is a blu-ray of a kinescope going to look like. I was presently surprised that, while it still looks like a kinescope (which it is), this edition has improved contrast, sharpness and sound. That doesn't mean it is perfect, but I have bought six editions of Robert Herridge's  ""The Sound of Jazz"" over the years on VHS, laserdisc and dvd. This one is the best I've seen. Also included on the Disc are two other Robert Herridge productions:  ""Jazz from 61"" with Ahmad Jamal and Ben Webster (unfortunately missing opening and closing songs with credits), and ""The Sound of Miles Davis"". ""Jammin' the Blues"" with Lester Young, and a well known piece from a 1951 tv show with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie are also included on the disc, as well as the audio of the Columbia studio album (not the actual soundtrack to the broadcast).  I compared The Sound of Miles Davis on this disc with the version included in the Kind of Blue 50th Anniversary set -- and there is no comparison. The blu-ray was much sharper, much less grayed-out, had better contrast and was nowhere near as grainy. Get this before it disappears!

And PLEASE release remastered sets of THE SUBJECT IS JAZZ, Billy Taylor's 1958 series, as well as ART FORD'S JAZZ PARTY

P.S. One reviewer said that this material was available on  JAZZ MASTERS: VINTAGE COLLECTION. The content difference is:

- JAZZ MASTERS: VINTAGE COLLECTION takes out all the narration and credits (and therefore some of the songs as well). In the blu-ray disc of The Sound of Jazz, all of the Robert Herridge programs are shown in their entirety -- with the exception of Jazz From Sixty-One, which is missing the opening and closing songs and credits.

- this disc also includes the 1940s short, Jammin' the Blues with Lester Young and others, as well as the 1951 tv piece with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie",1430352000,9,1953,4.706744868035191
8707533,4,B00UN7F9DS,"THIS CONCERT WAS PREVIOUSLY RELEASED ON DVD AND TITLED ""JAZZ MASTERS: VINTAGE COLLECTION"". I PURCHASED A COPY AND WROTE THE REVIEW BELOW. IT WAS ISSUED FOR ALL REGIONS BUT IT TAKES SEVERAL TRIES TO GET MY REGION 1 DVD PLAYER TO START PLAYING IT. THIS BLUE RAY EDITION IS RELEASED FOR REGION 2. AND MY QUESTION IS ""WHY""? IS NOT THIS MUSIC AMERICAN AFTER ALL?

This DVD is coded ""all regions"" and I had to fidget with my Zenith player's remote control to get the disk to start to play. What a relief when it began to play.

There was a golden era of jazz and the engagements recorded here (in black and white - 1944 to 1959) date back to the zenith of that era. For one who was too young to have enjoyed these concerts in person, watching the DVD is mesmerizing. Imagine stumbling across a film of the real Henry VIII, Henry Ford or Frederick Douglass in heaven's vault after learning all the history. To see Ben Webster, Hank Jones, Coleman Hawkins, Billie Holiday (singing Fine & Mellow), Roy Elridge, Miles Davis, Jerry Mulligan and many others performing in their prime is truly unbelievable. If you know anything at all about jazz this is for you. It is a black and white film of acceptable video quality and very good audio. My one disappointment is that vol 1 of the film cut Jimmy Giuffre's beautiful blues short.

For another superb rendition of Fine and Mellow check out Carmen McRae's Ballad Essentials cd.

UPDATE - 5/19/2015: I've received my order of The Sound of Jazz and my region A/1 (US) blue ray player has no problem playing this blue ray disc. But the audio could be better. It is still two channel audio and I must raise the volume on my amplifier very highly to enjoy the concerts. I deduct one star for unimproved audio.",1429833600,,1742,4.485804416403785
