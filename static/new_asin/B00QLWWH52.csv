8691874,4,B00QLWWH52,"Nice package, The movie come in three formats DVD, Bluray, and a digital copy to load in Ipads or any other tablet.
The movie is great, remain me movies like Crash, or 2 Days In The Valley or even Pulp Fiction in the sense that are episodes (in this case not related) that take mundane situations and blow them out of proportion. Doing that kind the cinema with fantastic ensamble of actors you get a great movie.
In Spanish with English subtitle (I speak both and the translation are very good)",1433894400,,495,4.450549450549451

8691876,5,B00QLWWH52,"Following the steps of ""Twilight zone"" as well a tongue in the cheek to "" Steven Spielberg's ""Duel"", this collection of short stories will amaze you from start to finish. You will enter into the huge musseum of the Human Nature his basic instincts, raw violence, rage, hate, greed, hipocrisy, primordial revenge and the weight of the legal jungle.

Somehow you may have experienced nearly one of these cases or perhaps around a tale of your relative ones, because the crude realism that emerges from this picture is a true demolishing revelation.

Superb all the way through. Memorable direction and outstanding level of acting from alll the cast.

Kudos....",1430438400,,658,5.018348623853211
8691877,5,B00QLWWH52,"""Relatos Salvajes"" (""Wild Tales"") is an audacious collection of short stories from Argentina (English captions) which garnered a ten-minute standing ovation at Cannes and was nominated for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars. Written and directed by Damin Szifron (lots of Argentinian television), this starts with some memorable wildlife photography, shot with elegance and described by a playful voiceover. This sets the tone.

Rather than concentrate on the wonderful actors, I will instead give you hints about the unpredictable (and humorous) short stories; some are shorter (and darker) than others, but none leave you wondering about what happened. This is a refreshing change from many of the short stories we have seen or read. What a treat!
  * Let's start with Pasternak, or what I call ""Free Ticket."" We meet an assortment of passengers on a commercial airline who are strangers to one another. A sense of discovery is personal to start with and as our suspicions grow, we laugh at the contrived stories. That's all I'll say...
  * In ""The Rats"" (""Las Ratas"") we are in a late-night diner where a waitress greets a rude, demanding guest. As WE discover why she becomes so upset, so does the cook...
  * Road to Hell, or ""El ms fuerte"" is one I call ""Road Rage."" A businessman in an upscale car tries to pass a derelict clunker. The driver keeps swerving into his path and frustrating him, so when he finally passes him, he calls him an uncomplimentary name. Everything is fine until he gets a flat tire.
  * Bombita is one I call ""Tow-Away Zone."" We meet a successful demolitions engineer who is reminded by his wife to pick up a birthday cake on his way home. While in the bakery, his car is towed and our story begins. For anyone who has dealt with an implacable bureaucracy, this one is for you!
  * La Propuesta or The Deal,"" I call ""Hit and Run."" An irresponsible teenage driver hits and kills a pedestrian. Here we watch his wealthy family as it maneuvers to keep him out of jail, even as his conscience begins to bother him.
  * The final segment (I couldn't find a name for it), I call ""The Wedding Party."" This goofy, hilarious story takes place at a wedding reception. It's obvious that the bride and groom are delirious with joy and the elaborate party is very, very upscale. Just wait until she dials a workman whom her fianc had called a week or so earlier.

You won't recognize most of the faces...maybe Ricardo Darn (""The Secret in Their Eyes"")... as a result it's easier to suspend disbelief, even though this is a brilliant and convincing collection of actors. This film examines the human animal and how it reacts to stressful situations.",1428278400,3,2664,4.713362068965517
8691878,4,B00QLWWH52,"""Wild Tales"" (2014 release from Argentina; 122 min.; original title ""Relatos Salvajes"") is a collection of 6 seemingly unrelated tales which all bear the same theme: revenge. The opening (pre-movie credits) tale is a classic: a woman strikes up a conversation with another airplane passenger and they find out that by complete coincidence (or not?) they are both acquainted with the same person. Then it emerges that several other passengers also know that person... No worries, I'm not going to spoil anything. This first (and short) story sets the mood for the movie perfectly, as we get five more vignettes that are all one better than the other. I can't decide which is my favorite, to be honest.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Argentine writer-director Damian Szifron, and what a beauty he delivers with this movie. When I say ""beauty"", I certainly don't mean it in a sugary way, as in fact Szifron's film can be seen as a brutal assessment of the human condition. Check out the tale of the driver who gets tangled up with a 'left lane bandit' only then to get a flat tire and suffer the consequences... Or, even worse (should I say better?), check out the tale of the frustrated guy whose car gets towed without reason (according to the guy, of course), and wants to file a complaint... (this story reminded me of that Michael Douglas film ""Falling Down""). The movie is also a blistering indictment of Argentina's judicial system (check out the story where a well-off family's son kills a pregnant woman in a hit-and-run). The very last story (about a wedding reception that goes horribly wrong) is also the longest (close to 30 min.), and capsules the movie's spirit perfectly. It is no wonder that ""Wild Tales"" was a nominee for Best Foreign Language Movies at this year's Oscars. I've now seen 4 of the 5 nominated films and honestly they are all worthy in their own right, and then some.

""Wild Tales"" opened recently at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not super, which is a shame (as it turns out, the movie played only 1 week). I had high expectations for ""Wild Tales"" and they were met, and then some. If you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign movie that is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Wild Tales"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1428105600,3,2423,4.672131147540983
