5886415,5,B00E1RTEDW,"The single most important feature of a vintage film, regardless of whether it is a cartoon or live-action, is the quality of the reproduction.  I am a huge fan of silent comedy, for example, but I cannot even watch a poorly restored and dirty copy of Keaton's Cops or one of Chaplin's shorts, like those contained in the ""special collections"" sold in supermarkets.  The vast majority of the Betty Boop films released on DVD fall into this category: scratchy copies  with all the defects of whatever public-domain source material was used by the manufacturer.
But now, finally, Olive Films is handling the Betty Boop material with the care and affection she deserves.  The Betty character -based on actress-singer Helen Kane (although the producers successfully denied this in court)- first appeared as a secondary character in Fleischer Brothers cartoons in 1930.  The Fleischer Brothers, Max and David, were pioneer animators who had produced numerous silent cartoons and were considered Disney's top rivals.  Their productions were noted for irreverence, weird humor, contemporary music, slightly off-color material, and, it must be admitted, relatively poor artwork.  Betty's character, a pert little flapper in a short skirt and a garter, quickly earned her own series.  Her early films, made during the period 1930-1934, are near-masterpieces of absurd humor, with minimal story-line but plenty of outrageous laughs.  They often revolved around some salacious villain trying unsuccessfully to get under Betty's skirt.  Show these 'toons to your friends who believe old movies never contained any adult humor.
In 1934 Hollywood, under pressure from both federal and state governments, decided to enforce the Production Code, a set of ""do's and don'ts"" designed to eliminate sex, violence, and other unsavory topics from motion pictures.  The Fleischer Brothers, like everyone else, were forced to tone it down a few notches.  Betty lost her garter and most of her off-color material, and films that once revolved around threats to her virtue now taught ""life lessons"" instead: be kind to others, stand up to bullies, do your chores, that sort of thing.  The Betty Boop cartoons, along with other Fleischer Brothers series like Popeye (originally introduced in a Betty Boop cartoon), were still better than their competition but had lost their heart.  Let's face it, a Betty Boop who is not in imminent danger of seduction is no longer a real Betty Boop, but more of a Minnie Mouse or Wilma Flintstone.  Brave little Betty carried on despite her restrictions until around 1940, when the Fleischers cancelled the series.  By then the series, still nominally called Betty Boop, was being used as a catch-all to feature various secondary characters.
Now the good news: Olive Films have gone back to the original surviving source material, cleaned it up, and are releasing the BB shorts in as nearly pristine condition as possible.  I have many, many copies of Betty Boop films accumulated over the years but was (pleasantly) shocked to see how much better these new versions look.  Some of the films still have significant blemishes, because the original source material has deteriorated, and nearly all have some spots and scratches, but on the whole I would be thrilled if every vintage film released on DVD as ""restored"" looked half as good as these.  Watching them is a wonderful experience.
Some folks, I suspect, will have some quibbles.  The disks (two volumes have been released so far, two more are planned) contain twelve Betty Boop cartoons, brilliantly restored.  They are not in chronological order and seem to be randomly selected.  Most of the shorts include an opening credit that apparently was added a few years later, as part of a TV deal.  Personally I could care less about that but I can understand why some purists might get upset.  More important, there are no -I repeat, no- extras.  No commentary, no little documentaries, no trailers.  Many collectors will have a problem with that, but I consider it a mere minor annoyance.  Extras are nice but just that, extras, and I can live without them.  If I buy a sundae and it comes out perfect, I am not going to complain overmuch because I didn't get any jimmies on the side.
So, to sum up, no jimmies but one terrific sundae.  My hat is off to Olive Films for putting the life back in Betty Boop, and at a very reasonable cost.
Since these are Fleischer Brothers cartoons, I would like to correct a common mistake that often surfaces in reviews of Fleischer materials.  Inside the animation world, the Fleischer studio was famous for a number of innovations: the rotograph, the rotoscope, and a so-called 3-D process (they also devised the bouncing ball used in many sing-along cartoons).  Many people get these confused: in particular, many writers mistake the rotoscope for the 3D process.  They are not synonymous.  The rotograph was a technique used to insert animated characters into a live-action film.  The rotoscope, still used in modern times, was a mechanical contraption that allowed the animator to trace a living person onto an animated cell: that's the reason the main character in Fleischer's Gulliver's Travels looks so realistic. The 3D process was a set of frames placed on top of a table that were used to hold drawn backgrounds in place.  The animated cells would be filmed in front of and behind these drawn backgrounds, creating a startling illusion of depth.  Many Betty Boop and Popeye cartoons use this device.  I have noticed in the past that most reviewers on Amazon use the term rotoscope to describe the 3D process, when they were in fact entirely separate techniques.",1386374400,10,5670,5.032119914346895

8600188,5,B00E1RTEDW,"On this DVD there are the cartoons DIZZY DISHES, BIMBOS INITIATION, BOO-OOP-A-DOOP, BETTY BOOP LIMITED, BETTY BOOP'S BIZZY BEE, BETTY BOOP'S UPS AND DOWNS, BETTY BOOP'S MUSEUM, BETTY BOOP'S BIG BOSS, MORNING, NOON, AND NIGHT, BETTY BOOPS LITTLE PAL, BETTY BOOP'S PRIZE SHOW, and KEEP IN STYLE.

Here is some basic Boop history: The dog Bimbo (who appears in some Betty Boop Cartoons) was a semi-star long before Ms. Boop was created. However, over time Bimbo's career slowly died, and Ms. Boop's career (her first appearance was as a dog like character in DIZZY DISHES) took off. Ms. Boop was a star for about a decade, and in the beginning of her career (early 30's) she was known to be a little risqu. However, over time the sensor's office won, by taking more and more of her risqu qualities away from her. By the end of Ms. Boop's career she was dressed/ personified more as an innocent house wife/working girl (though she wasn't married). Betty had started her career as a sexy character, and she had replaced Bimbo (the dog) in the beginning, but towards the end of her own career Betty's dog (Pudgy) took over her films. Gradually Betty was seen less and less, as the cartoons began to evolve more around Pudgy.
However, on this DVD is Betty Boop's first cartoon short, ""DIZZY DISHES."" Often people wonder why Betty appeared in her first few shorts as a dog like woman. The answer is that she was originally not intended to have her own cartoons. She was a side character created for Bimbo (a semi-star at the time). Audiences seemed to love her the first time they saw her in DIZZY DISHES, and afterwards Fleischer made a point to have her appear in some Bimbo shorts. However, she became so popular that she eventually got her own cartoon shorts, and became a women (and not a female dog for Bimbo). Most people wonder why in several Betty cartoons she has a love interest with Bimbo...because Bimbo was not originally designed for Betty, but instead Betty was designed for him. Eventually audiences felt that a love interest between Betty and Bimbo was too strange (once Betty became human/ had her own cartoon shorts), and Bimbo was dropped from later Boop cartoons.

Now, about this DVD. Personally, I have seen certain shorts (like BETTY'S BIG BOSS) on other DVD/ VHS formats, and most of the time the images are grainy, sound quality poor, and scenes cut out/edited. However, from what I am use to seeing of the Betty Boop transfers, this is by far the best quality/ un-edited versions of her cartoon shorts. Yes, there are flaws throughout each episode (fuzzy, lines, ect.), but it's not pronounced enough to take away from the Betty Boop Cartoon stories. These are 80 year old shorts that ( have not been as cleaned up as some Fleischer Popeye cartoons), but have been restored very nicely indeed. At times you'll get great restoration on both film and sound (on this DVD). Other times you might just get better picture then sound, and visa-versa. What I really loved about this DVD is that there were cartoon shorts that I had not seen on any other Betty Boop DVDs. Also, I loved how almost all the shorts revolved around Betty, and not Pudgy!!!!! In the past I have bought, so called, ""Betty Boop"" DVDS, only to find that a good portion of those cartoons revolved around Pudgy (Betty as a side character)...On this DVD it's 99%  Betty Boop. Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As for children watching These cartoons???? I, personally, would allow my children to watch this DVD. Yes there are times where her dress might flip up and you see her bloomers/ bra, but by todays views it looks like a bathing suit/short skirt???? I don't know, you need, as the parent, to watch/ gage whether these cartoons are right for your children OR not. However, because this DVD contains more of the first Boop cartoons, they are a little more risqu compared to her later cartoons. Also, it depends on your child's personality! Some children could careless about old black and white cartoon shorts, especially when My Little Pony is on TV. However, there are other children who would enjoy these Betty Boop cartoons. Personally, I never cared for Mrs. Boop as a child. I thought her cartoon shorts were just silly, and some times confusing.  However, as a teenager, and now as an adult, I have grown an appreciation towards these old classic shorts, and now I love Mrs. Boop. Please keep in mind about your child's personality when purchasing this product. No, I don't think that moments of Betty's skirt lifting up, is to kinky (especially by todays cartoon standard). Initially, these quick scenes might surprise an adult (due to this ridiculous current cultural notion that animation/ Hollywood was so innocent back in the 1920's/30's). I know that when I first saw Betty (years ago) I wasn't expecting to see her bloomers, and yes, it made my eyes widen for a second, then I was over it...no great shock. Also, there are occasional references to ""possible"" alcohol, and other adult activities (a bird might pick up a mug of frosty beer/what looks like a beer-not actually labeled as beer and drink it.).you decide. I've seen more offensive scenes in modern day kid's films then Betty Boop cartoons, but that does not mean that you'll feel the same way, and I am aware of that. Also, there are adult moments, which parents will get the meaning/reference of, but I doubt that a child would???????? You figure it out. The first two cartoons Betty Boop is a dog like character (might be confusing to children, who are use to the human version of Boop). Also, in BIMBO'S INITIATION at the end, while Betty is singing Bimbo and Betty spank each others' fannies a couple of times.
If you are an adult buying this DVD for yourself, and are not familiar with Ms. Boop please keep the followings in mind (1) There are the occasional kinky moments. However, it is NOTHING like what you see on modern shows like Family Guy, Simpsons, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, etc. Don't buy this with the expectation of being shocked/ for shock value (un-less you have a thing for bloomers). (2) Yes, there are certain episodes where there is adult material suggested. For example in CHESS NUTS (this cartoon is on another DVD set) the king takes Betty into his bedroom, and the bed comes out (reference to the bed not wanting an inappropriate sexual act happening on it). However, if a child was watching this same scene chances are that he/she would not get the meaning/references. In my opinion modern day films, like the Shrek Movies suggest sexuality WAY more then the old Betty Boop Cartoons. After all, you won't see in a Betty Cartoon (unlike Shrek 2) a cat licking his privates, and then coming onto a women. I am not bashing Shrek, I am just making a point. (3) The average Betty Cartoon revolves around a basic story plot, lots of singing, and often filled with abstract scenes. Some of the scenes will not make sense to modern day viewers. The Fleischer company was well known for creating images/ scenes that were strange and abstract. The early Fleisher cartoons, by some, are considered to be the inspiration for modern day music videos. One example of an abstract scene (in Betty's cartoons) revolves around a baby who is singing, and his face gradually morphs into a hairy man/ wolf like face. (4) You should watch these shorts with more of an nostalgic flavor in mind (like, ""wow! This is what was cool 80 years ago.""), not necessarily seeing it through todays eyes. However, if you are an artist you may appreciate it more with your current perspective. Give it a chance, watch at least five shorts to help you in developing a flavor (if you don't have it developed already) for Ms. Boop and her classic cartoons. Chances are that after you watch this DVD you will end up singing one of her songs.
These are also very old cartoons with different standards/ views compared to todays standards/views. Some people might find some Betty Boop cartoons (a little) offensive?...even at times sexist? Please keep in mind that Betty Boop was seen as a sort of ""trail blazer"" of her era. She was a working girl (never married-not an acceptable choice for women at that time), she took care of her own life (didn't rely on a man to survive financially). In one short (on another DVD set) she even tried to become the first woman president. On the other hand she could at times be dependent on a male to save her, and or occasionally use her sexuality to get out of predicaments. One cartoon, BETTY ON TRIAL (NOT on this DVD, but the story is similar to BETTY'S BIG BOSS) started out strong (concerning women's rights/lib.). At first she refused to cave into the advances of a handsome cop (she stood up to an authority figure). She ended up in court, and was against a sexist, all male, courtroom (it was even implied that she was not taken seriously because the judge took notes on her legs/figure). However, though it starts off strong (concerning women standing up against a sexist 1930's world), she quickly caves in, and takes off with the cop (at end). By today's standards, this can be viewed as an insult to women. However, in the 1930's it was seen as a type of revolutionary movement (being against a sexiest, male society). However, in the 1930's it was an absolute male run world, the Fleischer Company wanted to be revolutionary, but at the same time they did not want to completely anger the culture norms/way of thinking of the time (that is why Betty ended up with the cop). Just the idea of a woman standing up against a male dominated world (in the 1930's) was a break through in movies/culture...just a reminder this particular cartoon was not on this DVD (I used it to make a point).
Overall, what I am saying is, ""respect Betty and her cartoons for what they are/were"".
p.s. the original Betty cartoons were designed mostly for children, but also for adults, however, when watching these shorts don't expect a Family Guy (more modern) sort of adult cartoon. 95% of Betty's cartoons are silly/ meant for children, but it is the other 5% that can become/ get a little adult (but not a PG13 rating).
Basically my final thought is, ""at least watch Betty to see what all the interest/ cultural hype is about"".

8600189,5,B00E1RTEDW,Thank-you for the great Betty Boop CD. It was perfect for the retirement party! It came promptly and was as described.,1402790400,,118,4.666666666666667
8600190,4,B00E1RTEDW,"Volume One of Betty Boop: The Essential Collection ended depressingly, with Bettys boop-oop-a-doop stolen in the short ""Foxy Hunte."" Thankfully, Volume Two quickly sets things right again with Bettys premiere as a nameless, floppy-eared, French poodle caricature of Helen Kane in Dizzy Dishes (1930).

An army of Bettys show up (in a Dr. Moreau-like half-canine, half-human state) near the end of Bimbos Initiation (1931). In tackling the secret society of the Masons, Fleischer and company attempt to out-Dal Salvador Dal. The Mason are transformed into whatever the hell they are, and Bimbo is put through a phantasmagorical rite. This balls-to-the-wall, off-the-meter entry is the best from either volume.

The ringmaster attempts to throw Betty on the casting couch in Boop-Oop-A-Doop (1932), but she she responds to his dirty whispers with a slap in the face and retains her boop-oop-a-doop, even when taming lions.

Betty Boop Limited (1932) is a rare, unfocused early misfire with Betty and Koko singing and dancing on a train (and not much else).

Betty Boops Bizzy Bee (1932) has flying wheat cakes, a surreal moon, and rowdy patrons being served up by hostess Betty.

There is plenty of surrealism afoot in Betty Boops Ups and Downs (1932) when Bettys house and the earth itself go up for sale. A flapper Venus tries to outbid a Semitic caricature in the guise of Saturn. Of course everything that goes up, must come down.

We tour through Betty Boops Museum (1932) and find Imhotep practicing Yiddish; a model for future Arab-Israeli relations. Flying skeletons and a musical number close this portion of the tour. Now, to your right for

Betty Boops Big Boss (1933) who does not know the difference between innocent flirting and spewing naughty limericks in poor Bettys ear. Naturally, an extended chase scene follows the harassment, but by the time the poleece! come out in full force, Betty has succumbed to the fat guys advances.

Popular violinist David Rubinoff  brings his famed Stradivarius to add a touch of artistic class to Betty Boops Morning, Noon and Night (1933) . This is a direct takeoff of Disneys Silly Symphonies (which, of course eventually evolved into Fantasia). True to form, the Fleischer Brothers stamp the pastoral scene with their own idiosyncratic touch (the sun bedeviled with a bad case of influenza, and Tom Cats amorous Social Club).

With the inevitability of the enactment of the Production Code on the horizon, the rot stars setting in with Betty Boop Little Pal (1934). Betty is already taking on the mantle of a desexualized mother, and the equally offending surrealism of the early shorts is fast becoming a distant memory.

A femme lifeguard gets manned up in Betty Boops Prize Show (1934). Betty herself is claustrophobically glued inside of a dress, playing a Beth Marion schoolmarm to her Johnny Mack Brown. While Johnny and Beth were delightful in their B-Western environment, this dynamic is depressingly ill-fitted to our favorite boopster.

A saccharine Betty is reduced to following instead of creating trends in Keep in Style (1934). She tries on a variety of Decency approved dresses for an audience which, understandably, no longer cared.

Neither the classic Minnie the Moocher, Cab Calloways head flying through hell, nor the glorious jazz shorts are anywhere to be found, making the Essential moniker for these selections not entirely accurate. Hopefully, these oversights will be rectified in the upcoming volumes. Until then, these will mostly satisfy. Quibbles aside, overall, these are excellent gifts from Olive.

8600191,5,B00E1RTEDW,"I have come to believe that these pre coded 1930-1934 cartoons represent the true blue adult humor intended. These cartoons were not meant for children. Of course there will be some out there who disagree. So be it! When Betty was forced to lose her sensuality and sexuality and where a less revealing outfit it took the life out of her intended character-sexy alluring female. Funny and adorable. After 1934 post Hays it was a slow but sure death for poor sexy Betty. And she finally died slowly but surly in 1939. That is why I love the early Betty best of all. Now, finally, we all can see the one and true blue Betty as she was meant to be. Censorship be over and done with. that is how I think and feel.
