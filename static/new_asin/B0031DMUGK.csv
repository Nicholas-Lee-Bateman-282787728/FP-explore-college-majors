8386886,5,B0031DMUGK,"Let me start by saying that if you loved the ABC Movie of the Week (which was on Tuesday & Wednesday in the 1970s) than you will love this collection of films. Are they Oscar worthy?  No...but then again who cares, especially not me!  I was looking for one movie and when I saw it in this set, I just had to buy it and I was thrilled with the titles included. My favorite being 'A Sensitive Passionate Man', but anything with Patty Duke or Valerie Bertinelli is also a plus. Just a side note: If you are looking for HD quality than don't buy this set. These movies are mainly from the 70s and I thought the quality was fine for when they were made. I am not one of those people that looks for perfection, instead I am more than thrilled just to be able to see a movie that conjures up some fabulous memories of my pre-teen years!",1454371200,,829,4.142857142857143
8386887,3,B0031DMUGK,"2 discs, 4 sides, each side containing almost 4-1/2 hours. I've watched only two movies, fuzzy and off color--maybe dubbed from VHS cassettes. But I consider tv movie production values just as good as those of theatrical movies, and in the present set you will see a lot of name actors of 30-40 years ago. My HD widescreen tv measures only 21 inches diagonally; larger screens will make matters worse.

Right now I just want to specify the actor names, and as I plow through this technological smudge, I'll come back a time or two to amplify.

TITLE & ACTORS

Betrayal:  Amanda Blake, Tisha Sterling

Born To Be Sold:  Lynda Carter, Dean Stockwell

Power, Passion and Murder:  Michelle Pfeiffer, Darren McGavin, Stella Stevens

Maybe I'll Come Home in the Spring:  Sally Field, Jackie Cooper

Hustling:  Lee Remick, Jill Clayburgh---Clayburgh received an Emmy nomination for her portrayal of a young but tough 42nd Street prostitute: the actress does an excellent job in recasting her voice and diction. Much of the flick is shot on the streets, and I was edified to see Julius's cheap eatery at 42nd and Eighth Ave.

Portrait of a Showgirl:  Lesley Ann Warren, Rita Moreno, Dianne Kay, Tony Curtis----In Vegas, Lesley Ann is the new well-trained dancer in the rehearsing troupe, Rita is the aging hoofer, and Dianne is the naif. The first manages to break completely with a married man, and to find a simple guy seemingly worthy of her trust. The second sticks with aging hubby Tony Curtis and another of his unwise moneymaking schemes. The third endeavors to avoid the ax, plus gets ripped off by an overnight guest.

Winner Take All:  Shirley Jones, Joyce Van Patten, Laurence Luckinbill, Sam Groom, Sylvia Sydney, Joan Blondell----Shirley (who kept reminding me of Hillary Clinton) is in her second marriage, to Luckinbill, who's ignorant of her past gambling addiction. She has secretly returned to it whole-hog. A whopping amount of film is at the card table and the race track, where she meets tall & handsome Sam Groom, ultimately a big stupid mistake. Her present PROBLEM is to replace the $30,00 she has drained from her husband's savings account.

The Night They Took Miss Beautiful:  Gary Collins, Chuck Connors, Victoria Principal, Sheree North, Stella Stevens, Phil Silvers----The movie begins comically with crude Phil Silvers emceeing an international pageant to select Miss Beautiful. Next, the five finalists, Silvers, Gary Collins, and others board an old seaplane to cross the Caribbean area, but two ruthless murderous hijackers force the plane down on an obscure island. There the third rifle-wielding member of the ""International Liberation Army"" is Sheree North, giving us a wild performance in abbreviated denim shorts. As the hostages are humiliated, we expect Gary Collins to do the heroic--but it is very long in coming.

A Tattered Web:  Lloyd Bridges, Broderick Crawford, Frank Converse----Police sergeant Bridges discovers that his son-in-law Frank is having an affair. Bridge's deep love for his daughter prompts him to extreme action. Handsome actor Frank Converse scores dramatically, and also displays a God-given luxurious head of hair in a slow-motion fight scene. Old drunken derelict Broderick Crawford is spot on, and gets a lot of closeups.

Promise of Love:  Valerie Bertinelli, Jameson Parker, Shelly Long

A Sensitive Passionate Man:  Angie Dickinson, David Janssen

If Tomorrow Comes:  Patty Duke, Sylvia Sidney

8386888,2,B0031DMUGK,Was hopeful regarding this set only to be greatly disappointed.  The production quality on these are HORRIBLE.  Looks like some kid in a basement pirated tv movies and burned to dvd.  Every film is out of focus.  Over half have repeat issues... you see a section of the film and then it repeats the same scene.  One film had big sections that cut in and out with blank spaces between cuts.  For the price I didn't expect award winning movies...I did expect basic quality of production.,1322352000,5,485,4.5813953488372094
