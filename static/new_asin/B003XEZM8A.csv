I've waiting a long time to get all the complete seasons of the new outer limits!
And here it comes! For me a classic of new TV-Shows.
The Bad News.
No Bonus-material on the DVD-Boxsets.
The package of these boxsets are worst and lousy!!!
The plastic in these boxes holds not one CD!!
For the price I've paid not enough standart.
Sorry.",1296950400,3,357,4.424242424242424
