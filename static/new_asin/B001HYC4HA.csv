8310079,4,B001HYC4HA,"""Aviva My Love"" (2006 release from Israel; 107 min.) brings the story of Aviva, a middle-aged woman and her immediate family and close friends, all living in Tiberias, a small city at the See of Galilee in northern Israel. As the movie opens, we see Aviva writing out a story in her mind and in her notebook. We learn that Aviva is a budding writer-to-be (and has been since forever). Aviva makes the acquaintance of a famous writer in Tel Aviv, who mentors Aviva. We see Aviva and her sister taking the bus for another meeting with the famous writer. Her sister shares a secret with Aviva: she thinks she's pregnant. We also get to know Aviva's husband, who's been out of work and desperately trying to land a new job, and also Aviva's mother (who needs more attention than is normal) and Aviva's troubled teenage kids. Will Aviva break through as a writer? Will her sister become a mom? Will her husband find a job? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is a great conversation-driven family 'drama' (with some lighter moments too), with lots of interesting characters. No action in this movie! And that is meant as a compliment, incidentally. Second, this movie showcases the beauty that is Israel. Check out the gorgeous landscapes from Tiberias and also Tel Aviv and tell me you don't want to visit that some time (I had the good fortune of visiting Israel a couple of years ago, one of the best trips ever in my life time). Last but not least, there are some great performances in this movie, none more so than from Assi Levy as Aviva. Kudos to writer-director Shemi Zarhin al around!

This movie won a bunch of movie awards in Israel, including the Israeli equivalent of the Oscar for Best Movie of the Year, and it's easy to see why. Great script, great performances, and making us emotionally pull for these characters. If you are in the mood for a top-notch quality foreign movie, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Aviva My Love"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1383696000,2,2080,4.618918918918919
