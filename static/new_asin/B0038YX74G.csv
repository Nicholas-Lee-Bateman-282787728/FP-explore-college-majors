8391826,5,B0038YX74G,"I really enjoyed the DVD and seeing everyone's stories; however, I was disappointed that the Life After Labor segment with Chelsea, Jenelle, and some of the others wasn't included.  The Life After Labor section with some of the other girls was repeated twice on this DVD.  Other than that the product was in good shape and shipped quickly.",1491177600,,339,4.827586206896552

8391833,1,B0038YX74G,"Very disappointed, the finale special on disc 3 is not even for the group of girls on discs 1,2 and 3, it is for the group of girls on discs 4,5 and 6. The finale special on disc 6 is also for the group of girls on discs 4,5 and 6. Not happy about this.",1406332800,,253,3.618181818181818

8391835,5,B0038YX74G,"I love this series. It gives you a brilliant look into the lives of young women aged 16, when they first get pregnant. It shows the decisions of keeping a baby and parenting, giving the baby up for adopotion. It catches the hard decisions of what they have to do now, learning that they are still teenages, but are also now moms. I recommend it for anyone that is thinking of having children, even if you are older than 16. It shows the impacts of life change so much, and it is worth a deffiant watch.",1297900800,,502,4.239583333333333
