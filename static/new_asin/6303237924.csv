ALMOST HOLLYWOOD: Tony (Short) is at the top of the bottom of the movie business, cranking out cheesy, sleazy soft-core porn thrillers at ""Straight To Video Productions."" But his whole world begins to unravel when his investors have an ""art attack"" and bring in India Allen (Allen), a bitchy bimbo and fourth-rate video star who demands script approval, fires Tony's favorite director, Abdu, and appoints her airhead film-school boyfriend as her writer-director. Even worse, Tony's star (and former mistress) Kristen (Dyer) is discovered dead on the set. Tony's the obvious suspect, and he's such a b**tard that everyone believes he did it. But did he? If not, then who did--and why? If there's any justice in the world, the real killer will be caught. But will India ever get her big break? Not if there's any justice in the world...

For several years following the release and box office popularity of ""Basic Instinct"" in 1992, cut-rate, rip-off ""erotic thrillers"" were the hottest genre of direct-to-video films in the low-budget movie industry. The trend left us with dozens of forgettable flicks with titles like ""Bedroom Eyes"" and ""Night Eyes,"" usually starring some blonde named ""Shannon"" sporting lingerie and a pistol on the cover of the video box. Weaver obviously worked on a few of these: He's got a gimlet eye for the details of the genre, combined with a true talent for lively dialog (""My artistic vision includes pubic hair!"" faux-Pakistani director Abdu screams at a shy actress) and a born director's sense of cinematic magic (are the murders we're watching real, or are they part of the film-within-the-film?).

The acting ranges from abysmal (Allen) to hilarious (""Johnny Cocktails"" as agent Sid DeSilva). And keep an eye on the guy who plays ""Abdu""--he might just be the new Peter Sellers!

Cutting comedy and satirical suspense combine in this skewering of the mini-industry, which simultaneously provides a fascinating insight into the mechanics--and the machinations--of low-budget filmmaking.",1421712000,,2277,5.080213903743315
