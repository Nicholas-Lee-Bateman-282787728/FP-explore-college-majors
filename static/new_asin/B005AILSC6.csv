4640965,5,B005AILSC6,"I have several of these videos: all are excellent. Yes it's true the filming could be ""more professional"" and then of course the cost would jump WAY up, out of reach for non-professional access. I've been to hundreds of trainings in my professional social work career and I like ""being in the room"".  More importantly, Teepa Snow provides THE BEST TRAINING FOR DEMENTIA CAREGIVING AVAILABLE. She is hands down one of the best trainers EVER! Don't avoid purchasing because of the recording quality comments: it is well worth more than 40 bucks.  BTW, many top name training companies put out lower quality recordings of mediocre training for hundreds of dollars more. There is a bit if overlap among the various DVDs but that is fine too. It reinforces the concepts! This video was purchased for Hospice as an in-kind gift for training purposes. A purchase you will not regret whether for family, church, police or pro use- everyone likes them and learns a lot. Much needed resource for our society as we sadly face increasing numbers of dementia patients among us.",1388793600,10,1064,4.87292817679558
4640966,5,B005AILSC6,"This was an excellent teaching guide for understanding more about Alzheimer's and how to meet and care for sufferers in non-threatening ways.  Teepa Snow speaks in energetic and often theatrical ways, alternating between the persona of caretaker and person with Alzheimer's.  She obviously has an incredible understanding of this disease and the people experiencing it, but never speaks in an overly technical way.  Her advice is eminently practical.",1384992000,2,450,5.588235294117647
4640967,5,B005AILSC6,"I am an R.N. who teaches Nursing Assistant classes. I looked everywhere for an instructional DVD to provide Alzheimer's training. I originally used the CARES program through hcinteractive.com which is excellent, but requires an ongoing financial expense. The Teepa Snow DVD's provide excellent information about the types of dementia and how to handle the challenging behaviors associated with them. The students love them. I highly recommend these for professional training and for people dealing with dementia in their family member.
Con: Her videos could use more professional videography and better sound, but this would not keep me from buying them.",1345334400,20,654,5.55
4640968,2,B005AILSC6,"I know it is a very good video but I also know it did not start at the beginning.  Also, the sound was not good at all.  I was very much disappointed.

4640969,5,B005AILSC6,There isn't any better training out there for caregivers. Teepa Snow is right on. Theses DVD's are worth every penny.,1343174400,,117,4.9
4640970,5,B005AILSC6,"As I wrote for another of her products, although I've had a great deal of dementia training, I have learned so much more from Teepa Snow! I highly recommend seeing her in person--but if you can't (or just to have in your library to review!) please buy her DVDs. If you are a caregiver (professionally or a family member) of someone with dementia, you really need to see these movies!",1338595200,2,383,4.485714285714286
4640971,5,B005AILSC6,"This is the best, most practical, and the most kind way of treating people who suffer from dementia. They are techniques that work.  Teepa is a wonderful trainer.  For $40 you can have one of Teepa's trainings to watch over and over if you wish, and share with friends.  (in my area an in-person training costs $120).  This is a great investment. Great for caregiving professionals and for families alike - helps so much to understand why person is behaving as she does.",1333843200,5,470,4.626506024096385
4640972,5,B005AILSC6,I found this video very helpful. Teepa Snow provided a very realistic and compassionate view of patients with dementia. Her tips were extremely enlightening. She was awesome. This resource was well worth my time and expense. It will be a great asset for anyone trying to navigate the puzzling maze of trying to understand what is happening to the loved one they are either providing care for or just interacting with. I know I will refer to it again and again.,1327363200,5,460,4.691358024691358

8463309,5,B005AILSC6,"There is only one worst thing than hearing someone has been diagnosed with dementia -- it is to discover that you are dealing with an under-trained dementia care workforce which includes the medical community.

Teepa Snow's dementia educational materials are first class and everyone will benefit from such training.
