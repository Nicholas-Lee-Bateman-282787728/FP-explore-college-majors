8051803,2,B0007U1YEE,"The first copy that I received would not play. I tried my home DVD player as well as my desktop PC DVD player with the same failed results. I returned the defective copy and received a second copy - completely hassle-free. The first several minutes of the film is completely blurred and distorted, but eventually clears. However, the picture quality is very poor throughout the entire movie.
This is a great little story and one of the very few films about judo. I enjoyed watching it as a young judo student, and my students have enjoyed it, too. Unfortunately, the quality of the DVD is very disappointing.",1407715200,,608,4.691588785046729
8051804,3,B0007U1YEE,Sensei George Harris was one of the greatest Judoka's in the USA if not the world. Nothing against him personally but the films quality itself wasn't very clear or what it should be in my opinion. Should not be allowed to sell this product in this poor condition. Sensei Harris is no longer with us may he RIP.,1396396800,,310,4.362068965517241
