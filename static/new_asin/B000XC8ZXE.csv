8227813,5,B000XC8ZXE,"Earl Shaffer thruhiked the Appalachian Trail three times. His first thruhike in 1948 made history, as no one before had ever hiked the entire 2000+ mile trail in one continuous journey. This DVD contains the slideshow which Earl created from the hundreds of color photos he took on that hike, and is narrated by Earl himself.

Earl thruhiked the AT twice more, again making history each time. His 1965 southbound thruhike made him the first person ever to thruhike the trail in both directions. At the time he completed his third thruhike in 1998 at age 79, he was the oldest person ever to have thruhiked the trail (though that record has since been broken). Included on the DVD are network news interviews recorded during and after the 1998 hike, which give a nice perspective on the man and his amazing accomplishments.

Here in the 21st century, a thousand or two people each year still attempt to follow in Earl's footsteps and walk the entire trail from Georgia to Maine. Of these, a few hundred succeed. Nearly all of them though regard Earl as a pioneer and a hero for being the first to prove that such a quest is indeed possible. Hearing him describe the daily experiences of that 1948 journey on this DVD is a delight and an inspiration, and for me was well worth the price.",1193270400,3,1285,4.606986899563319
