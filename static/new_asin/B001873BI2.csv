8268665,2,B001873BI2,"I really thought I was going to see something totally different than a typical UFC card. The video describes this ""blood & guts"" and ""turn your head"" type fights but does not deliver. The only notable exceptions are the combatants do not use gloves and headbutts are allowed. Other than that, I've seen the exact same thing on Spike, not to mention many better fights. I did like seeing ""Renato"" when he was younger in the one fight he was in. Also having the Doctor wipe the blood off the fighters WHILE still fighting took me back a little. Overall, video is not worth spending your money on.",1244419200,2,594,4.5092592592592595
8268666,1,B001873BI2,"This DVD sounds like it has matches on it that will be the bloodiest and most repulsive matches you'd ever want to see. But there are UFC cards, complete with all their newest rules, that are ""nastier"" than the matches on this DVD.

The first 5 matches are in English. The last 5 are in Portuguese. Most matches are pretty short, with only one going fairly long and back-and-forth among the combatants.

Sure, there's SOME blood, but like I said, if you've seen a UFC PPV card recently, you've seen better (AND bloodier) fights.

My suggestion? Save your money on this one.",1215820800,3,573,4.598039215686274
