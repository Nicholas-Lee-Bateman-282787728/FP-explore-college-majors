6608784,5,B00N3N6F6O,This by far the very Best Christmas special that these guys done between the two that came out. One of the best things about this one is Mr. Phil played a joke on Miss kay and Jessica on teaching them to go on a wild boar hunt. Plus Uncle Si as a wise man in a Christmas play. Need I say more? One of the Best positive shows out there and always putting Jesus first in everything that they do.,1410220800,18,393,3.925

This Christmas video was good and our family enjoyed it. Phil can be so sneaky cute when he wants to. I have to say that Uncle Si is the special favorite in our family. He is a hoot. I thoroughly enjoyed this video and will watch it again.",1434240000,4,399,4.194805194805195
