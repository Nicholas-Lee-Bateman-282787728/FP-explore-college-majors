5401077,5,B00A8QDHZG,"Quite a few Asian films - Korean, Japanese, Chinese - explore the meaning of old age and specifically the cycle of life. This is one of the great themes of this film. The essential fact of this movie is that, through custom (and religion), the parents who reach age 70 are to leave the society and meet their end on the top of the Mountain Narayama. In a sense, it is both frightening and sacred. The cycle of life continues with the younger generation.

Everyone who sees this provocative movie will talk about its striking visual beauty. But more importantly, it strikes a nerve - how should society allocate its scarce resources. Ironically, the fact that the old are left to die by exposure is not necessarily a statement that the elders are not valued by the society. The old are valued...but they need to recognize their function in letting the young take their place. The act of death, therefore, becomes a sacred rite. This is very vividly presented in the last frames.

I am glad that this visually arresting film is now available in Blu-Ray. While the movie was remade by Imamura Shohei, I actually prefer the striking sets of this film over the more naturalistic settings of the other.

This is a thinking person's film. It also depicts in visual form a very primitive society, letting us have a picture of what the world must have looked like 10,000 years ago.",1359244800,31,1372,4.637860082304527
5401078,3,B00A8QDHZG,"This is nothing if not an extremely vivid depiction of a traditional Japanese town, where there are terrible secrets and meaningless cruelties behind the facade of order.  It is brutal and sad, but there is also grace in some of the characters, in particular the kindly if deeply conservative grandmother, Orin.

The town is an agricultural outpost in 19C Japan, largely cut off from life in the city and mired in poverty.  The village is so poor that the population balance must be strictly maintained:  only the eldest sons are allowed to procreate or even marry, unwanted children (particularly females) are exposed to die, and elders are led to the mountain top and left to freeze or die of thirst at the age of 70.  As one might imagine, this creates terrible pain for everyone, though it enables them to survive as a community in demographic stasis.

The principal character is Orin, who at 69 is robust and much loved and respected in her village.  She feels shame at her health and consciously chooses to go through the ritual of passing on her right to live to the next generation.  Her eldest son is full of anguish, but will also obey the forms; he is newly remarried by arrangement with a woman from a nearby village whom he has never met.  She arrives hungry for life and selfish to take whatever she can for her moment.  Orin's younger son is a desperately lonely man, who is treated as an outcast by the other villagers, largely because his has a deteriorating lung that makes his breath unsupportable.  He is full of anger and malice, hating his taunting nephew.  YOu feel sympathy for them, but more than anything they appear as selfish brutes.

The rest of the town is similarly dysfunctional.  There are a number of bitter younger sons, deprived of chances at a normal life and huddled in jealousy and greed for experience.  There is a horrible scene where a young woman is forced to service them in the most sordid manner, making this inappropriate for children and simply grotesque for the viewer.  That is the problem with the film:  in its attempts to paint a realistic picture, it is so ugly and heartless at times that it feels over the top.  I do not pretend to know the historical accuracy of the films, but having lived in Japan, it certainly appeared realistic to me.

There are uplifting moments, when kindness is shown, but it has an ironic edge and a strange sense of the futility of it all.  In the backdrop, there is a feeling of mystery and fear at the power of nature, as when Orin's son discharges an old rifle at a dark, billowing tree - it is poetic and evocative.

Recommended for serious enthusiasts of Japanese cinema.  This is unromantic, but in many places well done.",1355097600,26,2711,4.615866388308977
5401079,4,B00A8QDHZG,"The only reason I am even aware of this film is because I try to stay up to date on Criterion's Blu Ray releases (a nearly impossible task given the state of my wallet), but I did manage to get BALLAD OF NARAYAMA, and I'm very glad I did.

Although I am, at best, a casual fan of Japanese cinema, I do also have a passing familiarity with Kabuki theater and bunraku.  (My undergraduate degree is in theatre.)  NARAYAMA tells a folk tale about a humble village in the Japanese mountains, and the story itself is only moderately interesting.  But the style of the telling elevates the story in some almost magical way...the whole becoming greater than the sum of its parts.

The story:  in the village we come to know, there are really only two things on everyone's mind, food and death.  Food is always scarce and hunger is a constant companion, and starvation is a frequent visitor too.  Thus, any elderly person who reaches the age of 70 is expected to be taken into the mountains and abandoned there to the god Narayama.  (In reality, these elderly are left to freeze to death.)  We meet Orin, a 69 year old woman who knows her fate is coming, and is ready to accept it.  However, she needs to put a few things in her household in order, mostly marrying off her recently widowed son.

The style:  the movie revels in nature and the colors and offerings of the outdoors.  Rice fields.  Trees turning in autumn.  Streams and brooks.  Paths through fields.  Yet ALL of the film is set on elaborate stages, with painted backdrops.  The whole film feels more like a really, really elaborate stage play than a film.  In Kabuki tradition, we have a narrator who sings commentary from offstage.  The lighting is all theatrical and sets literally move in front of us to reveal new scenes.  It's startling and beautiful.  The sets are fully realized, but we're never to be tricked into thinking we're anywhere but in a theatrical setting.  This has the effect of creating the intimacy and immediacy of theater (if you've never been to a GOOD live performance, you're missing out on the difference between  how we connect to characters on screen and with real, live folks just steps away from us actually living the experience as we watch it), yet it has enough expansiveness that we don't feel trapped by the confines of a normal sized auditorium.  The production design is almost miraculous.

Coupled with the singing and the truly amazing music (a shamisen...kind of a 3 string guitar/banjo), the production takes this humble tale and elevates it.  We see that love exists in this society (the middle-aged son clearly loves and reveres his mother), but is always secondary to the daily need to simply have enough to eat.  Orin accepts her fate, and in fact, is very embarrassed by the fact that at her age she still has all her teeth (this is taken to mean she eats more than she should to still be this healthy) and the entire village taunts her.  Her oldest grandson's wife has a baby on the way, and he actually boldly tells his grandmother that it's time for her to go to Narayama.  It's a bit shocking, but even more shocking is the treatment the town bestows on one of its citizens when he's discovered to have stolen some food from a neighbor.  His entire family is stripped of all they have...and that's only the start.  The lovely sets and constant scenes of nature stand in sharp contrast to the brutal lives these people live.  But they are not bad people...just imagine if every day you had to worry if you'd have enough food to feed your family.  Things would boil down to the basics pretty quick.

Orin's humble acceptance (even eagerness) of her role...to sacrifice herself to Narayama for the benefit of her village and family, seems almost like lunacy at times.  But in the context of the lives in this village, her willingness is really just her chance to give her family one final, meaningful act of love.  It's all remarkably powerful.

So why not 5 stars?  Well, for all its stark beauty and great music and meaningful themes, this 98 minute movie feels too long.  There are a couple of scenes wherein we see ritual enacted that go on for quite some time.  I know it's more my fault than the movie's, but I struggled to find the patience for them.  And there are moments of violence that are handled clumsily, including one scene at the very end that could have been quite stunning, but instead feels like high school drama class.  And while the film has very few closeups (adding to the theatrical feeling...we don't get closeups in live theater), many of the ones we do get show too clearly things like wig lines.  I can overlook them, but I can't help noticing them and being momentarily jarred.  But I still heartily recommend this film to anyone looking to broaden their perspective on just what film can do, and frankly, to be amazed at the technical achievement of the sets.

Sadly, Criterion has not come up with worthwhile bonus material here (hence the lower price).  Only a trailer and the usual essay in the booklet (although it is very good).  I can't help but feel with a little effort they could have come up with something, either about the director (who was quite prolific) or the making of the film.  Surely there is a scholar out there willing to pontificate!",1439596800,7,5293,4.590618336886994

5401090,5,B00A8QDHZG,"A long time ago in Japan, there was a custom practiced in poor and mountainous regions during a time of drought or famine.  That practice is known as ""Ubasute"", in which a relative carries an elderly family member to the mountain or a remote, desolate area to be left there to die.

Because of the tough times and families were struggling to feed everyone, it was a custom that was mandated by feudal officials.

And the custom has been featured in Japanese folklore passed down from generation after generation.  Songs about a relative carrying an elderly on their back, while the elderly would snap twigs, so the relative will no how to get back home.

The practice of Ubasute would be explored in the 1958  film ""The Ballad of Narayama"" (Narayama bushiko), written and directed by Keisuke Kinoshita (""Twenty-Four Eyes"", ""Morning for the Osone Family"", ""The River Fuefuki"", to name a few).

The film was remade in 1983 by director Shohei Imamura, who showed a brutal depiction of how villagers were at the time, the Imamura is a film best known in the West especially for winning the Palme d'Or  at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival.

But while the 1983 film receives a lot of attention, the 1958 Kinoshita film is remarkable on its own, as it is a kabuki-inflected version of a Japanese folk legend.  Featuring beautifully designed sets and wonderful cinematic work from that golden age, it's one of the highlights in the oeuvre of Keisuke Kinoshita's cinematic career.

VIDEO:

""The Ballad of Narayama"" is a 1958 film that looks gorgeous thanks to the restoration done in 2011.  Colors look amazing, no flickering, there were light artifacts but I was amazed because the picture quality looked nearly pristine for its age.  This is the best looking version of the film (released in the US) to date!

Presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio), according to the Criterion Collection, this new digital master was produced from the 2011 restoration done by Shochiku studios and Imagica.  For the restoration, a scan was created in 4K resolution on an Imagica IMAGER scanner from a new 35 mm interpositive wetgate printed from the original camera negative; the original negative could not be scanned directly due to excessive damage.  The restoration work was then performed in 2K resolution.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Ballad of Narayama"" is presened in LPCM 1.0 monaural.  The dialogue was clear through the center channel and I heard no pops, clicks or any problems during my viewing.

According to the Criterion Collection, the original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a sound positive.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Ballad of Narayama - The Criterion Collection #645"" comes with the following special features:

  Trailer- (3:26) The original Shochiku Japanese theatrical trailer for ""The Ballad of Narayama"".
  Teaser - (2:23) A teaser for ""The Ballad of Narayama"".

EXTRAS:

""The Ballad of Narayama - The Criterion Collection #645"" comes with an 24-page booklet with the following essay, ""Abandonment"" by Philip Kemp.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Family.

Filmmakers such Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu,  Mikio Naruse and Shohei Imamura are filmmakers who are well-known internationally for their films based on family and social dramas.  From the parental responsibility of making sure that life is arranged for their children to the disconnect between children and their parents as they get older.

While filmmaker Keisuke Kinoshita was not as well-known internationally as the filmmakers I have mentioned, he was one of the busiest filmmakers in Japan directing over 40 films in 23 years and one of the more popular directors during the '40s through the '60s.

While Americans may know of Kinoshita's work through his film ""Twenty-Four Eyes"" (available on DVD from the Criterion Collection), his 1958 film ""The Ballad of Narayama"" is a film known for incorporating kabuki but also introducing many to the concept of ""ubasute"".  But also the predecessor that inspired the 1983 Shohei Imamura version that would go on to win awards including the Palme d'Or at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival.

But while the 1983 is the version that most people know, the 1958 version is still a fantastic film and a classic that managed to incorporate Japanese culture such as kabuki (a classical Japanese dance-drama, but in this case, the music is what is utilized as a form of narration) in a film, but yet be appreciated by an international audience.

I enjoyed ""The Ballad of Narayama"" thanks to the wonderful performance by Kinuyo Tanaka as Orin, the 69-year-old matriarch who knows she will be turning 70 and that she will be taken to Mount Narayama to die.  But for Orin, she doesn't see this as a death sentence.  It's how others have died in the village when they turned 70 and the fact that they can join the Narayama God, it's something that she looks forward too.  So, through this final year, she just wants to make sure that all is set for her son Tatsuhei (in getting remarried) and her new daughter-in-law Tamayan.

Meanwhile, we see the anguish of her son Tatsuhei.  A man that very much loves his mother but knows that due to the custom of the village, even though his mother is healthy, he must take her up to Mount Narayama to die.

And its how Orin would convince him to forget about her.  From giving a positive attitude that she is ready to die, to even going as far as to bash her teeth in, so he won't worry about her.

But the film is able to capture other situations that take place in the village.  From what happens to a man who tried to steal and how his family is punished.  To how another elderly man tries to fight with his son, as he does not want to go to Narayama.

The incorporation of Kabuki gives ""The Ballad of Narayama"" its unique feel but also seeing how beautiful and how vast the studio sets were.  There are three moments that stick out in my mind.  One features Orin trying to comfort her son and everything goes black and only a single light shines on them.  Another scene is with Tatsuhei bringing his mother up to Mount Narayama and its amazing just to see how elaborate and how long these sets are.  I was very impressed!  But the third scene was quite scary to see how skeletons were laying on the mountain, as crows just sit and wait for one to die.  I don't know if this is what people saw back then but I can imagine with many elderly taken up to the mountain to die, the sight of skeletons or one's belongings must have been heartbreaking.

As for the Blu-ray release, the restoration of this film by Shochiku  Co., Ltd. was amazing.  The film looks nearly pristine for its age and the colors that come out in the Blu-ray release is amazing.  While there are light artifacts, with the 2K restoration and uncompressed monaural track, this is the best version of the film (released in the U.S.) to date.  I wish there was audio commentary included or even a feature on Keisuke Kinoshita but you do get a trailer and a teaser plus a booklet.

While the Criterion Collection release was impressive and the best to come out in America thus far, I have to admit that I was hoping the Blu-ray release was similar to what was released in Japan back in October 2012.  The Japanese Blu-ray release had a 4K digital restoration and it came with 38 minutes of special features, including a 100th anniversary of Keisuke Kinoshita half-hour feature for ""The Ballad of Narayama"".

Nevertheless, for its price (releases from the Criterion Collection with less special features are typically priced lower than those with more special features) and its quality, I was quite impressed by the overall Blu-ray release.

While most people are familiar with films such as Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru"" or Yasujiro Ozu's ""Tokyo Story"" (1953) which still resonates strongly even today among Japanese, ""The Ballad of Narayama"" may feature a custom that is no longer practiced but the situation in Japan among the elderly who feel they are inconveniencing their children still and committing suicide is still a problem in Japanese society.

""The Ballad of Narayama"" is a beautiful, well-acted and also a heartbreaking film from filmmaker Keisuke Kinoshita about a custom practiced in Japan long ago. Bringing together kabuki and innovative and beautiful sets created in the golden age of Japanese cinema, ""The Ballad of Narayama"" is highly recommended!",1364601600,11,8512,4.863888888888889
5401091,5,B00A8QDHZG,"A very thought provoking movie.  I loved the grandma, the most important character who teaches about life, love, generosity, thanksgiving and finally misguided sacrifice to get out of the way.  She could have taught her whole family and village many virtues of a high caliber human being.  I wouldn't have minded if her good for nothing grandson went to Mt. Narayama instead of grandma who would have been awesome to have around until the end.",1364428800,4,443,4.88
5401092,5,B00A8QDHZG,"The movie is presented in the form of a play, with sets transitioning cleverly before your eyes and a score playing almost entirely constantly.  Instead of using cutscenes, walls and buildings move, the sky changes color, and things are brought in and out of focus -- this was all obviously thought out extremely carefully.  The characters are easy to identify with, and the sets are quirky and cute.  The singing can get a little old at times, but it sort of helps bring in the dreary effect...fitting for a movie about abandonment.

I bought this as a blind buy during a sale and couldn't be happier.

BluRay PQ is great, there are some scenes that are really soft but that is the exception.  I watched this on my 60"" HDTV and there was phenomenal detail throughout the film.

Audio track isn't anything too ambitious, but sounded okay on my system.  No pops, hisses, etc., as with basically all Criterion releases.",1363910400,3,917,4.6875
5401093,3,B00A8QDHZG,"I say that in spite of the style the film is done in because I find myself ""bored to tears"" at (various points in) other Japanese movies. Sometimes, they just move too slowly. The director spends too long--in my opinion--on one scene. And that is the case here. I found myself impatient at various times--especially near the end while traveling up the mountain (to Narayama).

Otherwise, the film is interesting. It's obviously something new (and not yet another remake of a previous movie that has already been done three times). The viewpoints from the eyes of the village, the younger generation, and the middle generation are as one might expect.

The subtitles are easy to read. This is good because sometimes the subtitles blend with the movie too much and are difficult to make out.",1363737600,,789,4.837037037037037
5401094,4,B00A8QDHZG,"this deep and moving drama with its insights into ancient Japan will stay with you forever.  the production values are extremely interesting and produce an effect somewhere between reality and the hyper unreal environment of a kabuki masterpiece.  it is exotic, difficult to watch, and effective.  a good candidate for the criterion treatment",1363219200,3,342,5.415094339622642
5401095,5,B00A8QDHZG,"This is the more beautiful of two adaptations of the same story. Director Keisuke Kinoshita used traditional Japanese Kabuki theater as visual inspiration for a stunning story of generational tension in a small village (the other adaptation of this story is the far more realistic and brutal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ballad-of-Narayama/dp/B0015I2SNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ballad of Narayama</a>&nbsp;).

The plot involves three generations of a household: the aged Orin who is the matriarch of the household, her son Tatsuhei, and his son--a completely self-absorbed teenager--Kesakichi. The village tradition dictates that elderly parents are carried into the mountains and left there to die, so that the younger generations have a better chance to survive.

However this family problematizes tradition because Orin is in great health, as evidenced by her full set of teeth.  Orin is eager to carry out the tradition, counting down the days until her trip to Narayama. But her son, Tatsuhei, is deeply attached to his mother and does not want her to die. Her Grandson, Kesakichi, is wretched and taunts Orin, regularly demanding that she make the trip to her grave. Kesakichi's comically bovine wife, Matsu, is excited for Orin's death because there will be more food for them once Granny's out of the way.

The story and color is beautiful and tragic. The highly stylized sets contribute to the sense of watching a stage production.  Even with these layers to remove the viewer from the tragic events unfolding, this viewer was completely caught in the story.

As usual, the Criterion Collection edition comes with nice extras:

In context of film as art and that art preceeds society, I believe it is poignant to write that in January 2013 the new Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said the elderly should be allowed to ""hurry up and die"" to save money on health care.  Being generous of context, it was probably meant not to keep them alive against their will.  Remember the end of Solyent Green with Edgar G Robinson and that beautiful music Peer Gynt Suite No. 1?  What was your feeling when you saw this portion of the film?  Our current society and culture values practical and utilitarian constructs.  How soon before we catchup to our future?
