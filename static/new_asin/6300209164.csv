240386,3,6300209164,"Tobor is Robot spelled backwards.  Invented by a scientist (Taylor Holmes) for the space program, Tobor is befriended by the scientist's grandson, played by Billy Chapin (who appeared in the Christmas episode of Dragnet, the one in which someone stole a statue of Jesus from the church, and is the brother of Lauren Chapin, who played Kathy on Father Knows Best).  But foreign spies are after Tobor to turn his technology to evil uses.

This is one of the best Robot movies for kids from the 1950s, though not quite as entertaining as the Disney movie The Invisible Boy, which featured Robby The Robot from Forbidden Planet.  The name Tobor was used again for a robot in a more recent movie - Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

  The cast includes some of the most familiar and prolific B-move character actors including Robert Shayne, who portrayed Inspector Henderson on the Superman TV series; William Schallert, best known as Patty Duke's dad on The Patty Duke Show, with 300 film & TV credits - and still appearing in films today, like Sweetzer (2006); and Lyle Talbot, who appeared in everything from The Clyde Mystery (1931) to Newhart, including Plan Nine From Outer Space, Batman and Robin, and 42nd Street.",1160870400,15,1205,4.848780487804878
240387,3,6300209164,"Truly one of the better of the 50's robots!!  I feel sorry for the guy who created the awesome robot suit for this movie.  What a waste.  Miles better than the robot in Target Earth!!  I think they tried to walk the line between kid movie and classic 50's sci-fi and that's what weakened it.  Give the robot some lasers or somethin'!!  Let's see him take out some US Army troops or a tank or sumthin'.  Instead we see Tobor go off-roading by himself in a military Jeep and then stop the crooks by tearing the hood off their running car and reaches in for the distributor cap and pulls it off to stop the engine!!

I did have some great laughs with this one and like I said earlier, the robot is great. See 'Tobor the Great' just to watch him drive the Jeep or to watch a guy wearing just the robot-suit boots go up a small spiral staircase(Tobor is 8.5 feet tall, never would have made it up that staircase!!)

240388,4,6300209164,"TOBOR is one of the most delightful juvenile sci-fi B-movies of the 1950s, and one of the best movie robots of all time! Although TOBOR was closer related to the tin-can clanking robots in the old Republic movie serials of  the 1940s than to more futuristic versions like Robby and R2-D2, he  endeared himself to 1954 audiences of kids who loved to see a 7-foot-tall  robot as a hero. The archetypal boy-and-his-robot movie, like Robby in The  Invisible Boy (1957) this one works as sheer entertainment and no doubt  inspired many young boys in the Fifties to grow up to be scientists. Billy  Chapin as Gadge heads an all-star cast of sterling character actors during  the cold war McCarthy era. Stephen Geray is tops as the villainous spy you  love to hate, and was supported by top character heavies Peter Brocco and  Henry Kulky. They were nicely counterbalanced with Taylor Holmes as TOBOR's  inventor, Professor Nordstrom, and Charles Drake as a pre-NASA-era rocket  scientist. Highly recommended! Great fun for all ages!

After seeing the other sci-fi films with robots, some achieving academy awards and such recent thrills as ""Robo-Cop"", this limited plot film stands up quite well to this grown-up kid. Many of my childhood nights were spent filling in the Tobor plot by imagination because the film was not released on laser-disc or video for many years. It was still a thrill to see the transfer sharp in image and sound after seeing it only on the TV with commercials in between bad westerns and Andy's Club. For a kid under 13, this early robot star holds a special place. Unlike other sci-fi films that followed, there are no loose wires spoiling the believability here. For all of us kids it has an afternoon abundance of delights: secret rooms, passageways, gadgets that anticipate the world today---electric gateways, video surveillance, basement lab with futuristic hydraulics. (The remote control for ""Tobor looks like it belongs on the starship Enterprise.) Such things can captivate the scientific introvert of all ages. I give this low-budget high marks for a spare plot but good science and a warm heart. Basically, the story involves a scientist's grandson,(Billy Chapin)and Tobor, only after the kid indulges his curiosity enough to cause minor experimental mishaps with enough time to build up an affection between Tobor and the kid, allowing for a minor subplot with espionage implications that threatens our space program, and so on. It blows my mind to see in this forgotten classic a scene where they train Tobor how to dodge asteroids via a video game! Now how out-of-date is that? I didn't remember the video surveillance sequence and the initial break-in, so that was interesting, things that 60 years later the government is trying to perfect today. It was a surprise to realize that this film suggested that our government spare humans the early dangers of space flight and they didn't get around to it until drone activity today.(And we did lose 3 men) The scientist in the story was wonderfully played by (possibly) Taylor Holmes (or Steven Geray) as a kindly, wise scientist with a very human side. The more familiar B-actor, Charles Drake, plays the scientist-grandfather's sidekick and fellow inventor/collaborator. The grandson's mom is curiously played by Karin Booth who resembles Patricia Neal so well that you swear Gort, the robot from ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" would arrive any time. The foreign agents in this yarn seem to come straight out of ""The Adventures of Superman"" (probably on loan) but that does not threaten the outcome because that good science I mentioned earlier does arrive just in time to save the day. This is a classic yarn that could launch lots of kids into robotics if only there were adults out in Hollywood with enough imagination to bring ""Tobor the Great"" back for further adventures. Another bonus was seeing the Super Constellation airliner in flight, another short-lived classic.",1381190400,4,3023,5.0239043824701195

Tobor wasn't limited to this movie!

Apparently, years later Guild Films made a TV pilot featuring Tobor (and a kid named Tommy). The series was to be called: ""Here Comes Tobor"", and the pilot was called: ""Tobor and the Atomic Submarine"". There are many citations about this TV show on the Internet, even Amazon, so check it out if you are a Tobor fan!

*****************************************

Movie: Tobor the Great Review

When I was 8 years old, I saw ""Tobor the Great"" at summer camp. To my 8 year old mind in the 1950's, the idea of robots was the most exciting thing I could imagine. So I was thrilled with ""Tobor the Great"", seeing it as a child did in those days, days in which we had dial telephones, B&W small screen TVs, comic books, and ""Leave it to Beaver"" attitudes.

Tobor looked magnificent!

It is probably hard for anyone in the 21st Century to look at this film with such eyes, so much has been developed since this movie came out. It is important to remember that the iconic ""Robby the Robot"" of ""Forbidden Planet"" would not appear for several years, and when he did, the budget was much higher!

For its time, and especially for its budget and studio, ""Tobor the Great"" was actually groundbreaking on a number of levels, visual style, and characterization. This is what to look for in the film.  When looked at in comparison with other films of the time put out by Republic, it is possible to understand this.

And this is why I recommend this film -- to see a change in approach to sci-fi that had only once before been attempted, in ""The Day The Earth Stood Still.""

The Script:

The biggest problem with Tobor is of course the clumsiness of the script in so many places. Republic had been used to producing serial adventure pictures where action overshadowed any kind of thought provoking meaningful dialog, action, or situations.

Any viewer of this movie should keep this in consideration, as that approach is carried over -- in part -- into this film. So we have the expected cardboard good guys vs bad guys. In this case, the bad guys are ""communist agents"" - popular villains of the time -- ruthlessly and somehwat comically, trying to get the secrets of Tobor from  his creator. The good guys are the ""responsible scientists"" who create Tobor to help save lives in the space race. Their idea is to send robots into space as explorers and fact finders before risking human life on the endeavor.

This turned out to be prophetic, for it is exactly what NASA has done with Voyager and the Mars rovers -- though none of them are as endearing as Tobor. I doubt that anyone credits this film with its prophetic value in this regard.

The movie has some very redeeming qualities besides its prophetic quality, and these are what to look for when viewing the film. Here are a few things:

1. Gadge - The 11 year old grandson of Professor Arnold Nordstrom. The use of kids in movies was nothing new, not even in sci-fi. But this kid, a ""whiz kid"", serves to help us view Tobor through the eyes of a child, with all the wonder and innocence that a kid of the time would have when facing a complex 7 foot tall robot.

Gadge at one point says ""Gosh Tobor, you're beautiful."" His admiration, his awe, his love of the technology is unmistakable. This is a touching innocence, and a crucial part of the plot because Tobor responds to the love of this kid. Gadge is likeable, and not terribly annoying, even if he is a bit silly at times. His enthusiasm and eagerness to be involved with Tobor are completely understandable. As a kid, I identified with the character, envied him for his magnificent opportunity of having his very own robot!

2. Professor Nordstrom - Creator of Tobor. Here we have a Frankenstein allusion. The professor sees Tobor as a machine, a tool to help benefit mankind -- much as Victor Frankenstein saw his creature as the start of a new race of super-men that would benefit mankind (you have to read the novel to understand this).

But unlike Victor Frankenstein, Professor Nordstrom has no rejection of his creation. He treats it consistently as what it was designed to be, a tool for the benefit of mankind. Even when Tobor (under Gadge's influence) accidentally trashes the house, Nordstrom looks upon the incident kindly, not judging Tobor or Gadge.

This is a kindly Victor Franklenstein - and that kindness pays off in the end. His dialog is consistent on the matter, and as a character he never waivers. This is remarkable coming from a movie company known for uneven characters.

3. Tobor - He's the main character and has a lot of screen time, considering how complex and fragile his costume is.

A design note here is important. Prior to Tobor, Republic's robots were clunky and laughable ""water boiler"" robots, basically metal cans with an operator inside. They were well known to the audience of the time.

But Tobor was a remarkable departure. For one thing, inside his strange acrylic helmet, he has a face. That face, upon close inspection, does not appear at all friendly (it seems to frown), but that belies Tobor's character.

Tobor also lights up (who can resist a robot that lights up?) and has complex armatures and apparatus to work his arms and legs. He also has a developed and articulated body, not dependent on ""Dryer hoses for arms and legs"" that were the hallmark of earlier robots from Republic, and a characteristic of the robots in the movie ""Target Earth"".

I have looked for a creature designer credit and it is missing in the film, which is too bad. This robot is a design advancement from anything that came before.

Wikipedia has an entry on Tobor that claims he was designed by Robert Kinoshita, who also designed ""Robby the Robot"" from ""Forbidden Planet"". There is no citation in the Wikipedia article to verify this claim however, and the stylistic differences between Tobor and Robby would seem to indicate that this credit is erroneous.

A more believable citation (which is authenticated) is made by Fred Barton Productions (builders of replica celebrity robots) and John Rigg (of The Robot Hut). According to Fred Barton's website (where you can see a replica of Tobor), Tobor was DESIGNED by Gabriel Sognamillo, and was FABRICATED and BUILT by Mel Arnold (who also built GORT from ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"").

So don't believe Wikipedia on the matter of Tobor's origins.

Not that there aren't flaws. For one thing, he is disproportional. His head is huge, his body and arms are too long and his legs are short. He looks top heavy (as did the later ""Robby the Robot"" of ""Forbidden Planet"").

Regardless, it seems like Tobor was a very expensive costume to create and maintain (and the costume still exists today in the home of a collector) and the designers should get much more credit than they do.

As a character, Tobor has some throwbacks to the 1930's Frankenstein monster of Boris Karloff. Like the Karloff character, Tobor is unable to speak. He is potentially very dangerous (as when he accidentally trashes the house). He must express himself through some electronic tones and head tilts as well as some body motion.

Watch how Tobor interacts with Gadge at the end of the meteor-shower scene, and you'll see that in spite of the rigid costume, the actor does evoke an emotional response and express, although in a limited fashion, emotions. At the end of this scene, we know that Tobor knows that Gadge loves him and appreciates it. We get the feeling (later revealed) that Tobor will do anything to protect and save him.

Now why would a robot exhibit emotions?

This is probably the most misunderstood aspect of the film. Tobor is no mere robot. Yes, he has a controller, he can be manipulated like an automaton, but he also has an ""independence circuit"" based on ""ESP"". As Nordstrom explains, Tobor has sentience! He is able to understand human emotion and respond to it. In fact this is essential to his experiences in space.

For a sci-fi film of the early 1950's to introduce the concept of a robot with sentience, with emotions and intelligence (prior to the very droll ""Robby the Robot"" even) and for that film to come from a studio like Republic, is remarkable. It deserves credit it rarely gets.

Watch the movie for these aspects of Tobor, and you'll see a very different film than the surface film of the plot and script. You'll see what many reviewers completely miss.

An interesting note about Tobor is that when Prof. Norstrom and Gadge are captured by the bad guys, Nordstrom manages to send a call for help to Tobor. The robot leaves the basement laboratory (also designed extremely well and much better than what had come before) and eventually gets into a jeep and drives off! A robot being able to drive? How did he learn that skill? What did Professor Nordstrom teach him? Also, it is amusing to watch a 7-foot robot attempt to drive a jeep!

The character of Tobor is not a monster, although a movie poster suggests this when it shows him carrying the limp body of a female, but rather that of a hero because in the end, he saves the Professor and Gadge in true super-hero style. This is a robot to be admired! And in that scene, when Tobor almost lovingly picks up Gadge in his arms and carries him to safety, we know there is a wonderful bond between the two.

Sadly, however, they end the film in typical cardboard style. Tobor, by virtue of the rescue, has proven he is capable of full independent thought and can therefore fly a rocket ship. So we see Tobor in the ship taking off for parts unknown while Gadge says ""Goodby Tobor, and Good Luck.""

They could have developed the relationship between Gadge and Tobor a little more before this scene. But perhaps, they were running out of time. It just seemed impossible for Gadge to give up his new pal so easily.

Or perhaps, since Republic was known for serials, they planned a return of Tobor, a sequel?

----------------------

Conclusion:

Tobor the Great is in my opinion an under rated movie. Yes, the plot is somewhat silly at times, and uses cliche and cardboard characters as a framework.

But hidden within this are some more thought provoking and more deeply thought out concept and characters worth a second look.

Look at this movie with two sets of eyes.

Try and have the wonder of an 8 year old of the 1950's, living in a 1950's world and you'll see why Tobor the robot spelled backwards, is so amazing and exciting.

Try and look at it from a 21st Century perspective and compare it to what was around at the time. Look at the history of robots in cinema, the old Republic serials and then look at some of the groundbreaking and prophetic concepts of this film.

While much of the dialog is silly, and some of the characters are total cardboard, if you can see past them, you may see that Republic Pictures, not known for great art, made a major breakthrough with Tobor the Great.

It's a hidden gem.",1345593600,5,10950,4.63598759048604

240598,4,6300209164,"This is a fun little sci-fi movie from 1954. We see all the good guys and the bad guys at the height of the commie scare.

Human kind is planning to go into space. However we do not know what to expect. So an independent scientist and an ex-official of the government space project ban together to find a better way to explore space before sacrificing human life. It looks like there experiment can have nefarious applications if placed in the wrong hands. We know the story as we've seen it played out many times. However this one is well done and allows us to kibitz as the characters actually do not ""stay in the car.""

Don't look to me to give away the story as it is fun is seeing how it evolves.

An added plus of this film is the 1954 era where we see the technology (especially cars from the inside out) of the time and take a small sojourn to Griffith Observatory better known as Griffith Park Observatory, Griffith Park - 4730 Crystal Springs Drive, Los Angeles, California, USA. Unfortunately they only  show a small part of the faade had a dark spot on the inside of the Observatory. This would've been a perfect opportunity to show Focault's Pendulum a large pendulum that is free to swing in any direction. As it swings back and forth, the earth rotates beneath it, so its perpendicular plane of swing rotates in relation to the earth's surface. Devised by J.-B.-L. Foucault in 1851, it provided the first laboratory demonstration that the earth spins on its axis. A Foucault pendulum always rotates clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. I was in the observatory in 1954 and was very impressed by this pendulum.

Much of the rest of the film is shown in Iverson Ranch - 1 Iverson Lane, Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California, USA, where many of our favorite films were made.",1334707200,4,1833,4.610429447852761
240599,5,6300209164,"Could this have been one of the influences that inspired Mitsuteru Yokoyama to create Tetsujin 28 Go, what we affectionately know as Gigantor? I believe it's possible, but it's not confirmed. While many people in the States know about the 1960s Fred Ladd Gigantor cartoons,  and even fewer people know about the earlier Tetsujin episodes (recently reworked), there was a short-lived live action Tetsujin/Gigantor tv series in Japan. He was not the 20 to 60 foot tall robot, dedpending on how he's drawn to fit the scene from the cartoon, but somewhere in the 7 to 9 foot range. My knowledge of that series is limited to a one minute clip I saw on youtube years ago. Now here's where I make the loose connection first. Here Comes Tobor (a failed tv pilot) and the 1960s live action Gigantor seem very similar in their ideas and production values. The stronger connection is obvious. Both have a large robot.

240605,3,6300209164,"My friend and fellow sci-fi fanatic have our own personal ""wish lists"" of films we've always wanted to see.  Well, Tobor has topped my list for the past 20 years or so.  It's almost never shown on t.v., and even the VHS tape of the film has been out-of-print for years.  So it was with great enthusiasm that I greeted this long-overdue DVD release.

Unfortunately, like so many things that we build up in our minds to be great, the reality is that Tobor isn't really the ""lost classic"" I'd hoped it would be.  Oh, it's hardly a bad film.  The production values are first-rate, especially the expansive lab set wherein the title character is created.  And I was impressed that there was some real SCIENCE in this science-fiction: The idea of using artificial beings to test the dangers of space travel is a fine idea.

Where Tobor misses the mark is with the ludicrous plot device of the robot creating an ESP-based link with its inventor's grandson, which then proves useful when the boy is kidnapped by criminals intent on stealing the mechanical man.  It's as if the writers couldn't decide if their story was a kid's movie, or serious sci-fi.  With about equal amounts of both, the result is not that satisfying.

But if you like 50's sci-fi, you may still find this a worthwhile purchase.  It does retain much of the ""gee whiz"" innocence of the era, and I'm sure the nostalgia factor is high for anyone growing up during that time.

It does have a bit of a slow start but I concluded it was only building up to the big tale. We have a robot, we have a spy, we have some fun stories and some pretty good characters. There are a couple familiar faces and the story is familiar too but if you are a fan of the old black and white 1950's films, add this one to your collection.",1510099200,,515,3.8679245283018866
