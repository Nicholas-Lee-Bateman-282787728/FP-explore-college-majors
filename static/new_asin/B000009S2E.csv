1198137,2,B000009S2E,"A sci fi fan here. But no movie in recent years has portrayed the science part well. This was a noble attempt, tho. But the astronauts weren't realistic. They didn't seem professional astronauts. The feeling was not realistic. Seemed melodramatic overall. Movie-wise... not a great dramatic structure. Poor character development. Just generally... I dunno... why can't a film really portray serious space science with characters who would behave in a professional manner. Granted, that might SEEM a boring approach but ya know... if you're gonna go for realism then the filmmakers, they should have committed to a treatment that seemed really real and not filled with overly emotional, distracted and careless people making up this crew. also the sets... why must spaceship interiors look overly comfortable and sanitary? you ever study the ISS? it's fairly cluttered and not really that cozy and comfortable. Also the idea that the surface ice on Europa would be that brittle is absurd.  Overall, the attempt at realism just falls short for anybody who knows what the reality COULD be like. Very disappointing.

It's not that I need so much realism but ... ya know... they tried to make it seem feel real enough and anybody with a modicum of space knowledge, exploration of space knowledge will be totally disappointed. And the lack of convincing reality diminished the sense of drama making this flat. Meanwhile the writing, taken as a piece of space melodrama, was kind of lame too. Oh well. Maybe I should put my money where my mouth is and try my hand at doing this kind of thing right. We'll see how hard it is, I guess to get something actually dramatic AND realistic off the ground.",1372464000,5,1690,4.926315789473684
1198138,5,B000009S2E,"One of the best space/science fiction movies we've seen. Great story, suspenseful and thrilling, and totally believable regarding the science. We loved it and will see it again when it's released into theatres.",1372464000,13,210,5.393939393939394
1198139,5,B000009S2E,"I really mean it, this movie is refreshing among so much commercial sci-fi. But precisely because it is excellent for hard science fiction fans, be aware this is not your typical weekend flick most people attend just for the sake of entertaiment.

Europa Report is a very realistic account of how a trip to look for signs of life at this Jupiter's moon would be. The style is documentary-like but not boring, and the story line very interesting, that is, for hard science fiction fans.

WOWWWWWWWWWW!

this movie was all i wanted and more..been dying for some hard scifi since Prometheus and this definitely delivered--anyone saying they could not follow narrative--well--i think that was the point.
this was supposed to be realistic--and reality suffers from spotty reception and glitches at times.
the actors portrayed the fatalism of their situation well--i could really feel the visceral back and forth for every fateful decision they made to complete their mission--which was to ultimately not survive--but to get the data!!
none of that touchy-feely hoohah of the recent Star Trek movies--but the grit of the unknown and having to face it alone, in the end.  A++++++",1372464000,2,707,5.192982456140351

1198144,5,B000009S2E,"Magnet has become one of favorite production companies.  VHS, VHS 2, Tim and Eric, and now Europa Report...  The way Magnet releases movies (VOD > Theather) is a model I think will eventually catch on with bigger production companies.

Now onto the movie.  Europa Report is one of my favorite Sci-Fi films out of the past few years.  It involves six astronauts who embark on a journey to one of Jupiter's moons.  Their reason?  Searching for extraterrestrial life...

Although the story sounds rather cliche, the movie is breathtaking and will leave you feeling ""lost in space"".  I can't wait to watch this again in theaters... Bravo.  Bravo indeed!  Great movie!",1372377600,28,663,4.9363636363636365

1198155,2,B000009S2E,"Meh.  I'm happy for the people who enjoyed this movie, but as youngzen69 commented, why is it that, when in outer space, no one seems to be able to follow orders?  And why do the characters have no common sense? This movie should have been titled: ""Europa Report: Murphy's Law in Action"" - because whatever could go wrong, did go wrong, and you, sensible viewer, could see it coming from miles away. The behavior of the crew members in this film would have gotten them fired from most places of business, or slapped with OSHA violations, at the very least.  OK, so the camera angles were interesting and meant to mimic on-board recording cameras, and the set was pretty cool.  It tried hard to look realistic, and generally succeeded.  But the script and plot were just absurd.  The ship is landing on ice... and there are ice-quakes. So if this first-ever deep space mission is so revolutionary and the ship is presumably so sophisticated, why isn't there some instrumentation that can tell them how thick the ice sheet is that their craft is sitting on?  And why wouldn't they send out a sampling probe or sampling robot to collect surface samples, or at least some device that could asses and report on exterior conditions? Noooo, they send out ONE person, by herself, because she insists she can do this! How the hell does she know?  No one's ever been there before.  So she's wandering around on this moon,trying to collect samples, all by herself, on an ice surface of dubious structural integrity, when she decides she needs to turn her helmet lights off and walk around in the dark.  Well, you know
what's coming.  Silliest damn movie I've ever seen.",1502668800,,1658,4.682758620689655
1198156,4,B000009S2E,"Like many B-movie titles, Europa Report is a quiet representation of flashier progenitors. Simplistic shooting and somewhat generic prop usage characterize the production's low-budget origin in an otherwise authentic appearance. The story is rather hokey and overly reliant on camera-shake and flickering computer monitors, but, the acting is surprisingly fun and believable as a consequence. In the end, the gradual build-up to the final scene truly makes Europa Report a great sci-fi thriller. It may lack the scope and heady intensity of similar movies like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Interstellar, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Martian, and The Abyss, but it otherwise captures the essence of a true sci-fi thriller just by largely avoiding most of the contrived and overly-used plot devices seen in many science-fiction movies.",1501977600,,838,5.503875968992248
1198157,3,B000009S2E,Not bad.  What I like most about this movie is all the characters react to the situations which they encounter in a very rational and realistic manner.  They are all professionals and act as best they can to complete the mission.  There isn't any crying and and over played dramatics; and no characters going off the deep end and acting irrationally.  If you are sick and tired of idiotic sic-fi movies give this one a try.  It's a simple story told well.,1501459200,,455,4.5

Story is interesting, I haven't finished yet, about halfway through and I don't want to stop watching. It is for one who wants a more slow-paced sci fi with a sense of realism and beautiful filmography. Almost returned this after reading the bad reviews.

1198161,3,B000009S2E,"Most of the movie was solidly three star, but the ending was two star.  That's the washout from a five star premise, five star special effects and five star props, all combined with one star writing, actors locked into having to recreate one star reactions in the script, and one star weightlessness imitation.

First of all the movie is worth watching once.  Great premise and amazing effects.  But whoever wrote the script tried to portray astronauts, cosmonauts and a taikonaut as having the intelligence and reactions of a group of high school friends out in the woods going through something like the blair witch project.  Throughout a real mission true astronauts would have been professional and on point the entire time.  The Captain would have actually led and made final decisions all the way through.  Let's be real- out on a space walk in real life and what you're doing takes 10 minutes longer than the amount of oxygen?  No problem.  Come back in, have a bowl of soup and prep for a second space walk.  Walking on thin ice in real life and see some bioluminescence moving under the ice beneath you on a strange moon?  Get the heck away.

I wish a someone in the studio head office would have gone along with the movie but demanded a re-write that consulted real astronauts and focused on the psychological effects of long term solitary confinement.  Then the movie could have easily been five star.

But again, it's worth seeing once.  Enjoyable if only for the special effects and the basis of the story.",1498089600,,1519,4.700757575757576

1198168,1,B000009S2E,"Like the title might suggest, this is a movie about traveling to Europa to see if life exist underneath the ice surface where scientist discovered a ocean exist. So the concept of this movie is solid and that concept is what attracted me to this movie. The problem here is that the story is so disjointed skipping around from different perspectives that there is never a sense of cohesion and predictable. The overall sound in this movie is unimpressive. I found the ambient music constantly playing in the background annoying. Also, view in this movie felt compressed. As if I was looking at something in a 4:3 ratio rather then a 16:9 ratio is the best way to describe it. I never felt like I was seeing the entirety of the surroundings. Maybe, that was intentional.

That said, modern day movies like these tend to frustrate me. Why? Because no one seems to know how to follow orders in space. If you have ever watched other modern day movies in this genre you will know what I mean. Prometheus, etc. for example. A better movie by the way. Crew members get out into space and common sense goes out of the window. In this movie a women after the ship probe mysteriously failed decided that she wanted to walk the surface of the planet to discover why the probe mysteriously failed and hopefully discover what the probe failed to discover. After a long debut among the captain and crew permission was cautiously given. Okay, no problem. Make sense right. Here is the problem and every modern day movie in this genre tend to do this sort of stuff. During the mission a order was given to return to the ship. Come back to the ship. Response, its so beautiful out here. Reply, time to come back to the ship you are on backup oxygen now. Response, in just a minute I think that I see something out in the distance..Errrrrrrrrrrrr.

1198197,3,B000009S2E,"It is really hard to watch because of the obviously poor direction. About 45 or 50 minutes into the film, there is a scene where there is an orbiter and a lander. The orbiter stays in orbit around Europa while the lander obviously lands. Some astronauts are supposed to stay behind on the orbiter while others are in the lander. There is a scene where the astronauts in the orbiter have to do a spacewalk to repair communications gear. One of the astronauts, Andrei, is doing the spacewalk. Andrei tears his suit and barely makes it back inside the orbiter before he runs out of air. The very next scene shows Andrei inside the lander. He obviously cannot be in two places at once. Then I realized they are jumping around a lot in the timeline and the repair attempt happened earlier. They don't make that clear though. This makes me think that the director was on drugs the whole time since he obviously was not sure in what order each scene should appear in the film or at least make it clear when each scene occurs.

It jumps back and forth to the past and present wayyyyy too much. There is a clear lack of technical expertise with regards to the story line and lack of technical accuracy.

Good Points for the Film
Though the film was a b movie, it still had some really decent work in it. The props such as the ship, electronics, and space suits were actually pretty good. Much of the film is seen through cameras on board the ship and helmet cameras on space suits. That idea wasn't always executed well, but it is still a good idea and it certainly makes the film interesting. I felt that the acting was pretty good, the plot was good, and many elements were really good ideas. They just were not able to put it altogether very well.

The concept of landing on Europa to search for evidence of life is a very real and high priority goal for the scientific community. That is what piqued my curiosity about this film. It had poor reviews though, so I wanted to find out if that was because it was too technical for most people or if it was just not a good film. It turned out to be the latter. Still with better execution and a better story line these ideas could lead to a really good film. Hopefully lessons were learned and these film makers will try again.",1476489600,,2267,4.367298578199052
1198198,4,B000009S2E,"This movie is based on the second book on the 2001 Odyssey series by acclaimed Scientist, Astrophysicists, Knight of the British Empire, and Inventor Arthur C. Clarke. The saga is about 1/3 of the story of  ""2010: Odyssey Two"".

It is an interesting hard-science fiction genre story from 1984. Unfortunately, some of the facts are not accurate because the book was written in 1984 and much has been discovered since by new missions and probes launched around and after the 1980's decade. However, it is an intelligent plot and if you excuse some inaccuracies and the fact that this a low-budget film, you will enjoy it very much.

Hard-Science Fiction is not for everyone, which does not mean that it isn't good. My favorite authors were Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury before being introduce to Arthur C. Clarke but now, I think that I prefer Clarke over the aforementioned, and Ray Bradbury shouldn't even be consider as a SF author but more on the realm of fantasy (because really, if you criticize the facts of this movie, then what would you think about the ""Martian Chronicles"" TV series based on Bradbury's best seller.)

I wish Hollywood would take more projects like this one. This film will make you think about how tinny we are, the possibilities for other forms of life in the Galaxy and of the perils to come for the first generations of human space settlers. We are far from that, as politicians and Humanity are more concerned with day-to-day pressing needs (maybe my great-grandchildren ).

It is a very interesting film and I really enjoyed it. It is a 4 stars movie to me.",1475884800,,1588,4.718411552346571

1198210,5,B000009S2E,"EUROPA REPORT succeeds on several levels. First, it's a believable science fiction story, full of realistic sets and subtle special effects. I was especially impressed by the interior design of the ship. The characters were also genuine, adding to the realism. The idea of traveling to Jupiter's moon of the title, is well within the realm of probability. Next, this movie works as suspenseful, dramatic horror as well. It's absolutely drowning in claustrophobic dread and building doom! While watching, I was reminded of the movie THE DESCENT, as that was likewise an adventure into the unknown, taking a group of characters into a fight for their lives, up against something that is both unexpected and lethal. In addition, EUROPA REPORT is a ""found footage"" film done right. Using the many cameras aboard the spacecraft, it never appears cheap, forced, or cheeezy. It accomplished its objective well, by being entertaining, while simultaneously increasing our desire to explore. Highly recommended...",1470614400,2,1003,5.3544303797468356
1198211,5,B000009S2E,"...one of the very best- hardcore, realism, intense;  Science Fiction that probably will become science fact- if we make it off this planet.",1470528000,2,140,5.086956521739131
1198212,5,B000009S2E,"It is widely assumed that Mars will be our next celestial destination in our quest to become an interplanetary species.  The present film calls that into question.  Presently, excluding the Earth, there are 3 places in our solar system where life as we know it could exist:  Mars, one of Saturn's moons called Titan, and one of Jupiter's moons, Europa.  I suppose you could throw in another moon of Saturn called Encladus as it has geysers which supplement Saturn's E Ring  (yup, astronomers label Saturn's rings alphabetically from the inside-out).  Nobody is talking about finding little green men here, but some sort of plant or microbrial life is within the realm of possibility in each of these bio-hotspots in the solar system.

The present story explores the possibility of a manned mission to Europa to search for life.  Here on Earth, it used to be thought that life could not exist around underwater volcanic vents.  Come to find out, not only does life exist there, but it THRIVES around volcanic vents.  It is thought that Europa has an ocean & tectonic activity caused by the gravitational field of Jupiter (just as the moon controls the tides on Earth).  If this is the case, then Europa could have underwater volcanic vents, just as we have on Earth.  If this is true....well.....I'm sure you can connect the dots.

Just one problem:  the ocean, assuming it is there, is under several miles of ice.  As the astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson said,  ""I want to go ice fishing on Europa.""  The present film sends our first band of ice fishermen / fisherwomen to the outer solar system in hopes of making the single greatest scientific  discovery in history:  evidence of alien life!

If you are looking for a sci-fi adventure that takes place in the not-too-distant future, then this story is worth a look.  Also, it must be told:  if we could find a way to neutralize Jupiter's radiation, then the actual landing on Europa would be an engineering feat not too much more complicated than landing on our own moon ~ something we've already done.  Landing on Mars, on the other hand, would be enormously more complex.  Of course, getting out to Europa adds several degrees of difficulty, given the fact that it's about 1/2 billion miles away as opposed to our moon which is a mere 238,000 miles.

People who enjoy a good science fiction story will find a lot to like here.  That said, one needs to take heed of rule #1 of being an astronaut:  if you're going to land on Europa, be sure to lock your doors!!",1470528000,22,2516,4.684931506849315

The effects are amazing, some of the most realistic space effects I have ever seen. Great character development, these people felt very real. But where is the flash? There is very little story here. This feels more a showcase piece for a director and a new special effects house to just show off what they can do. But...sadly this visually appealing movie suffered from the utter lack of any real action or story. This movie, no matter how beautiful, is STILL BORING AS HECK!

1198253,3,B000009S2E,"There's a lot to praise about this movie. Good acting, good visuals, decent plot, and some scientific errors, but nothing too ridiculous to force a reasonable person to suspend disbelief. On the other hand, I found the science aspects of the movie to be predictable and far too shallow. Because the science was a major part of the movie, I'd say it's a big flaw that the science wasn't explored in enough depth.  If you're going to give the science a shallow treatment, then there'd better be a good human interest story. That didn't happen here. For comparison, Matt Damon's character in The Martian was really well developed and I cared about his story line as much as I enjoyed the science, and story line and science were woven together in a way that made a greater whole.  In Europa Report, the character development is spread across several people, and only goes deep enough for one of them. In this way, neither the science nor the human interest is really that engaging.  That's a shame, because the premise of the movie was strong enough to make an excellent movie in both aspects; just check out the thrilling trailer to confirm how great this movie could have been.

This is a very good film. There is little in the way of character exploration (the format of found footage does not allow much). Yet we do see grouth and  developement.  The characters are not stereotypes. It is realistic science fiction, but not too strictly.  The pursuit of knowledge is dangerous and there is a reason to fear the unkown.  But yet there is still honor and glory in gaining knowledge for human kind. This is one message. To bad there is a post scripted speech at the end.

Im not a fan of the sci-fi genre, be it something like The Fifth Element or something like Star Trek. Heck, my favorite sci-fi movie isn't even that sci-fi to most people (Children of Men). But when I started up Europa Report, I was captivated by the way it was shot and with how atmospheric it was. Look, Im just as sick of found footage movies as anyone else, and yet here the different cameras actually make sense and you can believe that everything is in sync. It's not one of the best movies I've seen this year, for a few minor reasons, but Europa Report is worth watching for any sci-fi fan, or anyone who just likes to wonder about what else is out there.

The movie is made up of footage from the Europa One, a spacecraft set out to explore the moon of Jupiter- Europa. There are numerous cameras installed on the ship, with some being on consoles, on shelves, on the walls, and every space suit has one inside the helmet facing the person, and another one on the shoulder to show what they see. Every aspect of the journey is being recorded. This is all footage that was recovered from the mission, and at the beginning of the movie, a few people talk about the expedition and how important it was. We also get some clips of one of the crew members- Rosa, as she explains a couple of things that were going on when things got intense, and what was going on in her mind. The mission starts out perfectly. No problems, everyones getting along, communication with Earth is clear. But its clear that they encounter problems when they bring up that one of the crew members was lost, and then it becomes clear that there may have been other losses.

Theres a shot in the movie that is just tremendous to see, and the way that they let the scene go on without cutting to something else, allowing it to sink in, gets tons of respect from me. Its as the craft slowly heads down to Europa. Its one long shot with the craft making it down and we hear the voices of the crew talking to each other, giving reports on their status. All you see is this little ship sinking into the distance and for some reason, it really stood out to me. Europa Report is also one of the few found footage movies Ive seen that doesnt mess up its gimmick. How many found footage movies have you seen where theres at least one moment where its clear that no one in the group of characters is holding the camera, and that its some random person who never gets identified? With how everything is set up in the ship and on the suits, that never happens. Each camera is labeled in the upper-right corner when it switches from shot to shot. Theres not a moment when you don't know how somethings being filmed. I also -loved- how Europa looked. The surface has this weird, twisted look to the ice, not like anything Ive seen before. Theres a very real feeling of loneliness there, helped even more by this look.

One of my problems with Europa Report is that it was hard to connect with any of the characters. I don't quite mean that it was hard to relate with any of them; some of the situations they get into are very relatable, or weve seen them in other movies. The thing is, we never learn much about these people. I can kind of understand this because it may have made the movie more dramatic, or it may have seemed weird to have revealing scenes with these kinds of camera angles. When something bad happens to one of the few characters with personality (and keep in mind there are only 6 people on the ship), I didn't feel much for them. The scene was edited beautifully, and the dialogue was perfectyet I didn't care as much as I would have if I knew more about the character or they had more screen time. I guess thats where the more believable camera angles end up hurting the film. In your typical found footage movie, its always one or two cameras that somehow get their footage merged perfectly together with little or no gaps in time, but its also from a more personal point of view. Youre right there with the character. Here, you're watching them, and most of the time, everything is mission-related. Youd think that would be a good thing. You know you have forgettable characters when the only thing making me want someone to survive is because they're pretty or did a noble act, rather than having depth or being interesting.

The other thing that bothered me was that the movie is about 75% straightforward in telling the story, with bits and pieces of other scientists coming in to talk about the mission here and there. At one point though, were taken back to something that happened earlier, after events after it happened already play through, then it cuts back to another time. I had to rewind it for a few seconds to check the mission clock that shows up to see where the movie was. Why do this when you can tell this story from beginning to end without any issues? And as is the case with a couple of other movies Ive seen lately, I wasn't a fan of the ending, even thinking to myself ohthis is it isn't it? and THAT was it?. The ending here isn't terrible, and it doesnt ruin the movie. I was just hoping for something more than a vague reveal.

Im still glad I watched the movie, and encourage anyone who stumbled upon this page or heard about it in a short conversation like I did to watch it. At just an hour and a half it never overstays its welcome and has some truly nice shots. If only it had better characters. If someone remade this as a regular movie without using the found footage angle, I could see it working. And if you're really curious about what was going on, I recommend reading 2010: Odyssey Two by Arthur C. Clarke, since this is kind of an adaptation of that.",1436054400,11,5955,4.351618705035971

1198325,4,B000009S2E,"A fine little sci fi movie that despite its flaws stands head and shoulders above most.  There are some improbable occurrences (as has been noted by others) but compared to any other science fiction film made in the last 50 years (pretty much since 2001 ASO), it is one of the more realistic ones.
The mission duration and spacecraft designs are relatively accurate.  In general the characters playing the astronauts are more realistic than portrayed in most space movies (I am reminded of the awful Armageddon and its Space Dementia).  One thing I cant stand is unrealistic characters (like James Cameron and Ridley Scott movies usually portray).  In this movie all the characters are done pretty well - especially the characters played by Anamaria Marinca and Michael Nyqvist are particularly noteworthy.  Furthermore the sacrifices that the crew make as things go progressively wrong speaks well for the crew and the scientists (though as pointed out by some, the lack of repair capability for the transmitter, along with the inability to detect a solar flare are two unrealistic elements).
I enjoyed the use of relayed footage- it adds a sense of additional realism but some may find the breaking of rhythm subtracting from the pace.  The motivations are realistic- investigation of Europa to see if there is life, but as some have mentioned, there would likely have been some additional unmanned probes sent.
Nonethless, despite these quibbles this movie is quite good.  If you like Caitlin Kiernans science fiction short stories then I suspect you will like this movie (and vice versa).  If your sense of wonder has been deadened by too many zombie movies and nonsense like Star Wars and Avatar, then you will find this movie boring.",1428710400,,1739,5.013888888888889
1198326,2,B000009S2E,Overall could have been a three.

1198328,5,B000009S2E,"After reading several of the very discouraging reviews, I only purchased that movie on impulse, because I came upon a good deal.
I do not regret having done so.
This is not a space opera. Fans of Star Wars, Star Trek series, Riddick Chronicles, etc, may very well be disappointed. I am not putting down those productions as own them, and I enjoy them myself immensely. I'm just stating that Europa Report belongs to a different category of SF.

The action is definitely about a mission's unfolding steps, the daily routine, the unforgiving hazards, the tragedies that have to be taken in stride, the duty of dedication to a common goal. We follow explorers in their methodical progress, their unexpected challenges, their personal relations, their mistakes. All of which, I understand, could feel somewhat pedestrian to the viewer used to enjoying a faster pace. Some reviews correctly state that one feels like watching a kind of documentary, and that may not be for all tastes. On the other hand, what it may be like to be on such a far going mission is convincingly rendered.

Life on board such a vessel demands that, at all times, for survival's sake, everyone be alert and on the lookout.  There is a kind of permanent tension, strain, even at down times when everything' ok. That is how I felt as a viewer. For me, the movie recreated very well that state of mind and I always felt on the alert. I was never bored. I always felt some kind of suspense was the norm.

SPOILER ALERT:
I am certainly not going to give away the ending, nor any of its particulars, but I have to mention it because it left some reviewers very unsatisfied and they strongly criticized it. They felt cheated.

It is true that the ending comes upon one extremely fast, but it remained plausible since in real life many events also happen in a few seconds. We need only look at the daily news for examples. Moreover that fast ending is logical because it is in the nature of the unfolding events themselves. So, there was neither commercial concession to that ending, nor was it a cop out. The movie's premise and inner logic were respected. I was taken aback by the surprise, but I never felt cheated.  I found the ending convincing and strangely moving. How the whole narrative imparted to the spectator could be obtained is also satisfactorily explained.

Rather than SF that elicits knee jerk reactions, it is SF that compels reflexion, questioning, thinking. It presents the awesome, utterly unforgiving challenges of deep space exploration, and the dedicated individuals who will dare embrace its risks. Watching that movie feels like actually watching the future. Isn't that what SF was supposed to be about?

The extras on the visual effects and on the composition of musical score were informative and interesting.
As far as I am concerned that is a movie I will watch again with interest, pleasure, and curiosity.",1428451200,6,2903,4.768924302788845

The movie could have been more interesting than the usual horror movie set on an oil rig, but it wasn't.

The whole structure of the movie, which is told as a series of flashbacks, is terrible. It's not clear when the flashback occur, or who is talking, at first. The makes the movie very disjoint, and confusing.

The cinematography is terrible. Lots of jumpy footage, and bad angles, trying to make it seem like ""real"" footage. Adds nothing but annoyance to the movie.

The science is poor, and sometimes ridiculous. When the first problem happens, someone asks ""Should we go on?"". It's a spaceship, dammit. It doesn't do U-turns! It's on a trajectory, it's going to follow that trajectory. There's no going back, at least not without way better technology than they have in this movie.

But the most ridiculous part, that shows completely that the film is clueless, is the final voice-over: ""More than we had ever imagined"". What's more than they had ever imagined? There's life on Europa. That's it, in total. I don't know about you, but that's what I ""imagined"" this film was about. That's WHY YOU SEND AN EXPEDITION TO EUROPA. Everyone who as thought about Europa for 30 seconds has imagined life there. But not the people who sent an expedition there, nope, ever occurred to them. And the fact that life exists is the _only_ interesting thing in the entire movie. And the ""life"" on Europa gets less screen time than Godzilla in ""Godzilla 2000"".

Sure there are flaws with some of the physics and communications delays that would lengthen as the craft got farther from Earth, but at least they tried to honor the real universe.  Sure there are minor issues like lacking propellent to get off Europa and all flight and experiment scenarios have a backup plan. Almost everything is triple (or more) redundant for human spaceflight, so a broken radio is just complete BS.  This is NOT a JPL unmanned mission. External fuel and oxidizer tanks aren't sexy - isn't that what they say in the movies? Without those, they aren't leaving Europa.  This is a flaw in almost every single scifi movie made (except Red Planet, sadly).

Even with those issues, this is the most realistic scifi movie since Apollo 13. They left off details like power systems, how the rotation was maintained, food storage, water storage (even with recycled urine), or even how large the ship was and how they planned to get back home? Guess that stuff doesn't add to the plot?  They should have checked with the life-sciences department at JSC - tastes change in zero-grav, so spicy and flavorful foods are demanded by astronauts - DEMANDED!

As the movie played, I was fact checking things on a tablet - I'm not a exobiologist or expert on Jupiter, or moons so checking some of those things made me feel better about the movie.

Don't get me started about that other movie - Interste..... complete BS and fantasy, that is. Theoretical physicists love it for some reason, but F=Ma rules when it comes to getting off any moon-sized or larger rock.

Would we send people to Europa before sending them to Mars or one of the moons of Mars?  Doubtful. The ""humans have never been farther since 1972"" statements seemed unlikely.

If you want to see the most realistic space movie I know for modern times, Europa Report is it. At least they didn't completely ignore gravity during the flight even if they didn't honor the 1.315 m/s on the Europa - about 7.5x less than Earth.",1428105600,,2214,4.675257731958763

I really wish Hollywood would get past this cheap phase they're in of making big budget films with seemingly no money at all.  Of course that's exaggerating, I'm sure Hollywood spent at least 30 million on this 2 million dollar quality production, though 15 million probably just went to advertising.

SPOILER:  The genius in this film is that you don't realize until the very end that you're watching a monster movie, filmed from the perspective of people who don't know the monster is there until it's too late.  And we don't really see buy a glipse of it ourselves when it finally comes for that very last crew member.
END SPOILER

The problem is, as genius as the premise and realistically imagined the overall finished work, once you've seen it, the bulk of the film just isn't entertaining enough to ever watch again, if not too downright annoying to even consider sitting through twice - which IMHO very few ""found footage"" films pass that test, but there are a few.  Regardless, this film likely won't have the longevity or replay value of even the already outdated 2001 A Space Odyssey, much less Alien.  The entire film plays like a fantastic setup to a promising sci-fi adventure thriller.  But ultimately it's little more than a tease with low quality, interference laden, claustrophobic camera-work constantly getting in the way of the grand adventure of it all.  Which this film takes it to an extreme by cutting out so, SO much, you'll question whether the disc is scratched repeatedly or that your internet is crashing, even though you know it's just the movie - like I said:  annoying!

Edit this down 10-15 minutes and finish it out with a conventional storytelling with real character development rather than just vague glimpses of people going about their job and talking to the camera, and photography and effects where the viewer not only knows what they're looking at, but is blown away by the vistas and detailed CGI, and you've got a movie worth buying and keeping.

As is, this is sadly a rental, one that you could probably watch on 1.5x speed and not miss anything.  I'm not one of these teenage or twenty-something reviewers who can't appreciate taking the time to set up a good story, or some thirty to forty-something who can't adjust my own predefined expectations of what a movie should be, to be able to enjoy where the writer/director is ultimately taking us.

1198338,5,B000009S2E,"""Europa Report"" is a very entertaining science fiction movie - if you don't overanalyze it.  The plot hinges on a deep space mission in which 6 astronauts travel to Jupiter's moon, Europa, because of the belief that there might be life there.  The movie is told as a documentary style interspersed with real-time footage.  I've read other reviews criticizing the authenticity of this or that, and to those critics I say - it's a movie.  If you are a science fiction fan, you will really like this movie.

The music is haunting and the way the film is shot is excellent.  The scenes, vantage points, and overall cinematographic approach is very interesting.  I personally was drawn in to the film and didn't want to stop watching it.

If I have any complaints, it is the ending (which I won't give away).  Suffice it to say that the ending reveals something that explains the events of the movie very well; however, I think that what is revealed at the end could have been left unsaid and the movie still would have been compelling.  I could understand if someone who saw this felt the movie failed because of the way it ended, but I don't share that view.

1198342,4,B000009S2E,"A hidden gem. This year I've discovered several ""indie"" low-budget sic-fi films that have been surprisingly good: Moon, The Signal, and this movie, Europa Report. I had no idea smaller sci-fi budget movies were coming out so numerously. About this movie: It's quite good, quality acting and storyline, mostly realistic, cool space ship and unusual editing style. I rented from Amazon but after just finishing I bought it. Regarding the one-star ratings that say this film is horrible, this movie is like Moon and The Signal --- slow, detailed, and really tells a STORY. If you like laser battles, ships exploding, and James Bond in space type blockbusters, you will NOT like this film, so don't watch it.
As far as originality of the film, has anyone here read 2010 The Year We Make Contact by Arthur C Clarke (the writer of 2001 Space Odyssey)? This movie story is taken straight from its pages: a manned ship heads to Jupiter's moon Europa, which scientists have discovered has free water under thick layers of ice, and therefore possibly life forms in the water. I won't say anymore so I don't give any way ending spoilers. I don't mind that this film is basically about a story within 2010; as a sci-fi nut who enjoys Clarke's imagination, it was great to see this particular story fleshed out before my eyes.
I hope there are more good indie sci-fi movies released this year!",1424044800,2,1380,4.754166666666666

1198345,4,B000009S2E,"Thoroughly enjoyed it, my favorite sci-fi since moon.
They could have setup the overall course a bit, and the pacing / editing for the first 1/3 of the movie was a bit chaotic, but once it settled down it was a pleasant and intelligent treat.  Does a good job being tense, without jump gags or bulls*** 19 layers of technical.  When it did the space is dangerous thing - it explored dangerous aspects of space that haven't been done 1000x before which I appreciated.  I also was really pleased that no one cracked under pressure, the best astronauts from the best programs in the world acted like professionals through and through for the first time ever in a movie - no one went crazy and turned into the bad guy for the final climactic showdown, it kept it much more straight scientists on a mission going to do something acting while like scientists.  It steered such a nice solid course, it probably left some room open for a little bit more speculative stuff at the end - the movie had given me both enough while not too much for me to construct my own story about what was going - stomping on my own story with a cleanly defined ending was a bit of a let down - although I really appreciate it not ending in some bulls*** mystical time traveling alien jesus ending like the last dozen big budget sci-fi movies.

It also stars Embeth Davidtz, who is an excellent actress. (Bicentennial Man, Amazing Spider Man 1 and 2, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, etc.).

The film is a mockumentary about a failed mission to Europa where the crew hopes to search for life in the liquid-water sea beneath the moon's ice crust.

They are lazy, usually have no storyline, and the constant camera movement is just nauseating. Europa Report is different, as the film is told through surveillance cameras, aboard a state of the art space ship. Europa is a privately funded mission to the sixth moon of Saturn, to investigate strange heat signatures detected by NASA, that could be alien lifeforms. The cinematography was better than most of these film, and there was somewhat of a back story, however Europa Report is really not much different than a million other similar films. Nothing really happens until they reach their destination, they find something strange, and then must decide if fighting for their lives is worth the potential for scientific discovery. I bet you can name a dozen other films that were similar. As for the cast, they were just like film, in that they were very average, with little to nothing of note. Science Fiction is my favorite genre and I'm always hoping these films will show me something new and excited, but as with Apollo 18, Mission To Mars, Sunshine, and Moon, I was extremely disappointed. Europa Report wasn't a bad film, but it wasn't unique in any way.

An extra star because of all the NASA equipment and footage, otherwise a well deserved One star for everything else. (Can't comment on the acting as there was only one emotion allowed throughout the movie- what's an actor to do with that?) Someone needs to tell the director about emotions... you need to have at least two in any movie over 90min and if you Must pick One and only One, Depression is probably the wrong play. Can't have the audience hanging themselves, bites into the sequel money.

SPOILERS.... Whopping BIG, Smarmy Contemptuous Ones

The equipment and footage appears to be real NASA stock. The shots are delivered handi-cam and shaky-cam from internal ship cameras that cut out..... alot - more than a bit annoying. This ship has .... many malfunctions... that are not explained. No backup systems (no low gain antenna when the high gain antenna mysteriously ""blows out"" killing one member (pause for everyone expressing their depression). They soldier on. Send two guys out to fix something and.... another one bites the dust committing suicide because he only has twenty minutes to wipe down his suit of a toxic chemical and really can't be bothered. And they have no spare air in the airlock. (Did I mention that even unmanned satellites generally have two transmitters?). .... pause again to be depressed about lemming #2. Bump down on Europa and one goes for a walk - sees a strange light, follows it - and mysteriously falls under the ice and dies..... pause to be depressed.... Lemming #4 goes out searching for signs of bacteria - sees the same lights and goes to say hello. ""They're shy and blushing with this pretty blue radiation - I've collected so much radiation already, some of the blue stuff might be nice....maybe if I turn off my light and walk blindly at them, they'll say hello""
...... moment of silence for #4.
Next, they manage to screw up takeoff on a world with 14% of earth's gravity (another unexplained malfunction) and crash. (Scratch#5 but on the Plus side, the dirges are getting shorter). Oops! forgot to leave anyone  on the main spacecraft and we only brought one (beta version) lander! (Yes, they did that in Aliens, but the audience was having Fun and forgave them. NOONE is having fun here.) All of this with cut forwards, cut backs, shaky cam, ultra close cam (so we can see reflections in peoples eyes for minutes at a time - not that there's anything to see there). Add the long ..... Long moments of silent contemplation followed by reckless or flat-out stupid action and you wonder if there's any real thinking going on. Didn't see the last 10 min because.... well, with the cut forwards, I already knew who survived - kind takes all that tension out of your shoulders early in the movie knowing who lives and dies. And by the way.... if you Know that Jupiter emits enough radiation to make a surface walk dangerous (which is why you are here), would it Kill you to spring for a 200lb rover? Kick the suicidal guy off the roster if you need the weight, the psych eval could have predicted he wouldn't last that long anyway! (You can spot the suicidal guy right away.... he's the cheerful one. The rest are too depressed to get a knife and open a vein.)
Ten million dollar robot too expensive for the 50 billion dollar mission?.... Fine! How about a $100 patch kit for a space suit... you know.... to keep anyone from dying from a minor puncture .... bicycle repair kit?..... pre-chewed gum?

Guys.... if you have connections with NASA and can get your hands on cool equipment for a move, Spend a few bucks and find yourself a WRITER. Actually, go nuts, pay TWO. One technical consultant (the guy who wrote this) and someone who know how to keep the audience awake or at least make it clear that the protagonists are the humans and not the glowy fungus thingy.

It is impossible to care about this crew - the only emotion is depression and.... Damn, given the defective gadgets and flawed ""if it doesn't work - you're dead - deal with it"" - attitude the budget boys clearly had (no backups for anything... not even backup plans...And mind the explosive control panels ""those cost extra"") I'd be depressed too, but then I'd turn the ship around and make sure it made re-entry on a nice parabolic trajectory for the Project Manager's house.

1198401,4,B000009S2E,"This movie has been compared to _Apollo 18_ and while I enjoyed that film I agree with the other reviewers in saying that this film is superior. For one thing what the crew members encounter on Europa seemed more realistic, more haunting, more evocative of both the possible wonder and terror that exists in the vast reaches of space than what the doomed astronauts in _Apollo 18_ found.

Production values were good, the scientists and engineers seemed believable, and I enjoyed the film not focusing on rivalry or romance among the crew. Sure, they were human, but they weren't mentally unstable or acting in such a way as to endanger the mission. They felt realistic, people I could empathize with, they were professional, and just struck me as good human beings. They reminded me of some of the scientists I have seen on deep sea documentaries at various points in my life. Well done.

It was a found footage film though presented in such a way that found footage would make sense....no ultra long battery life for some wonder camcorder or the like here!

1198409,5,B000009S2E,"This is a very good SF film, one of best amongst those I saw recently. Not exactly a great masterpiece, but certainly a very honest, very intelligent and surprisingly original film. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Europa One is the name of the spacecraft which, in a near future, attempts the first manned space mission to another celestial body since the last Moon landing in 1972. Its destination is Jupiter's moon Europa. It carries a crew of six (four men and two women). This is an international mission, coordinated by a joint body called Europa Ventures, funded by USA, EU and Russia - and therefore the crew, if I understood correctly is composed of two Americans, two Europeans and two Russians.

The scheduled time of flight to Europa is 22 months. Once there the crew is supposed to divide, with some of them boarding the lander and some staying in the orbiter. Those who are expected to land are supposed to gather and analyse samples from the surface and then drill through the ice and explore the subglacial ocean with an unmanned robot probe. There are great hopes that life can be discovered in the ocean, because of heat signatures observed under the ice by previous unmanned missions (fictional ones as there were no probes send specifically to Europa in real life). All of this is just the introduction and covers like first five minutes - and about the rest I will say nothing more.

This is a SF film so of course it takes some liberties with reality and in fact we still don't know with certitude if there really is an ocean under Europa's ice crust... But still, this film tries to stick to real science and real reality as much as possible and therefore offers us a very, very pleasant experience for all amateurs of ""nuts and bolts"" SF. I must admit that I always liked this sub-genre, ever since I started to read SF as a kid in the 70s - and in the veritable deluge of super-hero film, horrors, space opera, alien invasions, time travels, alternate reality, post-apocalyptics, etc, etc. (which by the way I enjoy a lot too) this category of films seemed to disappear a little. It was therefore with great pleasure that I discovered recently two very good ""nuts and bolts"" SF films - the grandiose, spectacular ""Gravity"" and then this film, less flamboyant but nevertheless excellent.

It is fair to warn here that this is a slow film, which accelerates only towards the end - but still, I wasn't bored even for one minute. The story is also no-linear, so I would advise to watch it integrally because you may miss important bits, even in slower parts - if you want to leave the room to get more beer or popcorn, my sincere advice is to pause the film...

With the exception of Christian Camargo (""Dexter"", ""Twilight"") actors who played crew members were unknown to me, but they did really an excellent job. It is worth to mention them here:

- Daniel Wu plays William Xu, an American who is the captain of the mission (after all this is an American film)
- Anamaria Marinca plays Rosa Dasque, the pilot of the ship (she is European and may or may not be French)
- Christian Camargo plays Daniel Luxembourg, chief science officer (another European who may or may not be French)
- Michael Nyqvist plays Andrei Blok, chief engineer, a Russian veteran who is also the oldest crew member
- Karolina Wydra plays Katya Petrovna, a Russian science officer (marine biologist)
- Sharlto Copley plays James Corrigan, an American who is the junior engineer

The story is also partly narrated by people from Europa Ventures who remained on Earth - amongst them one is played by Isiah Whitlock Jr., who made such a lasting impression as State Senator Clay Davis in ""The Wire""...))) Another one is played by Dan Fogler (""Fanboys"", Good luck Chuck""), who for once looks like a human being, wears some nice clothes and speaks without using obscenties in every sentence...)))

This film, albeit slow, builds up quite a tension from the beginning and as we learn to know better the crew members a heavy sense of foreboding develops. The great finale and the ending are very strong, unexpected and surprisingly moving.

This film being in large part about a very large ice crust covered with cracks and craters you can expect some plot holes - and of course there are some, but they don't really harm this film.

Bottom line, I found this film a very, very successful thing and I enjoyed watching it A LOT! A really, good, solid, classical ""nuts and bolts"" SF movie. ENJOY!",1405382400,15,4508,4.666246851385391

Clips of video logs and on-board footage are put together to make the film, but the effect is lame. Like some guitarist is strumming his instrument with a home-made bow made out of donkey mane. Different? I guess. But does it sound good? No.
And how about some characterization? It's scant. And there's waaaay too much technical talk, lots of it mumbled. Unclear dialogue shouldn't be an issue in any film, let alone in sci-fi where info is coming thick and fast.
Moving on, no memorable scenes except the poor sod slowly drifting away from the ship until he dies. Didn't a couple of people fall through some ice? I guess so, but we were only given close-up shots of their faces, or images of distressed colleagues from inside the ship. Heaven forbid we get to see what's actually happening, like ummm... the ship landing? The first OR second time? No! And the breathtaking picture on the front of the DVD case? There's NOTHING like that in the movie! It's 95% low-budget BORING claustrophobia from inside the ship with characters we hardly know.

Why they chose that format is a mystery, because it ruins things right out of the gate for no reason.  The whole thing comes off amateurish, painfully in parts, which pulls the movie down harder and harder the further you get into it.  The soundtrack is grating and annoying.  It does the worst thing a soundtrack can do: be so punch-in-the-nose annoying that it distracts you from the actual movie.  The acting is spotty and unconvincing.

1198425,1,B000009S2E,"Europa Project it aint worth no $3.99, what a waste, this flick is definitely a 10-cent streaming film rental if Ive ever seen one. Europa, this waste of good celluloid had to be written and produced by a Canadian or Australian Studio - so it really helps to be a Canadian or an Australian to enjoy this flick. Cause these folks just look at film appreciation differently than we in the US, although granted, weve made our share of terrible Si-Fi flicks as well and Europa ranks right up there with the best, or is that the worst of them.

Europas screen play was weak at best, five or six really stupid astronauts, with less smarts than God gave a Troup of blonde girl Scouts, stumble their uneventful way to Europa and blunder their way into deaths.

The Projects cinematography had a few good moments but was mostly horrible. Practically the whole flick is shot from the POV of the space ships on-board security documentary log cameras - then assembled in to a four to six way split screen to show the action - and they used it far to frequently achieving the exact opposite effect the were hopen for. Instead of intensifying the primary action, it diluted the characters on screen energy with secondary visual gunk.

This long-ago, seldom used, then almost abandoned in films, method of multiple split screen visual camera continuity greatly detracts from the overall potential action or drama energy of whats important in the scenes and the emotion the story intends to create. When you clutter main screen depicting the primary action with 4 to 6 tiny sub screens, of the same scene or multiple scene locations, from so many angles, it reduces the primary scenes looses its power. To be effective, scene action should be as large as life, up close and personal, right in your face, grab by the pants and nail you to your seat visually mind grabbing.

But by adding so many tiny screen to absorb - it in turn makes the action insignificantly small, and reduces the primary action to a washed out distracting hodgepodge of conflicting character motion vectors making the characters effective action far less intense.

The sets were well done, But, if your hoping to see some great special effects forget it, cause there aint none - the budget was nil for computer time when it came time to render anything really visually memorable. The FX in Europa were as exciting as those I remind when going to an old Godzilla flick only to see Gojira with his zipper showing, a real disappointment.",1402531200,6,2491,4.704128440366972

1198439,3,B000009S2E,"A sci-fi movie Europa Report follows the Europa One mission that goes wrong  a privately-funded mission to Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter, to find extraterrestrial life forms. Being a found-footage film, Europa Report tells the story of six astronauts, using images of head cameras and monitor cameras in a spaceship, as well as talking heads scenes.

The film is very unique and ambitious in its effort to stick to realism, using the found-footage format that has become very familiar to us. While the method manages to visually enhance the reality of the film, especially its claustrophobic atmosphere, it inevitably makes the film reliant on dialogues that are often heavy and not always interesting.

But I think the biggest problem is the films storyline itself. The idea of a privately-funded spaceship travelling to discover the evidence of extraterrestrial life is not something that I can believe, especially when the film makes almost no effort to make us care the characters and their mission. Why should we, if they find something or not? Also, the films jumbled timeline does not help.

The filmmaker makes us aware at the start that something has gone very wrong with this mission to Jupiter's moon, Europa, but has us move both forward and back in time (without it being confusing) to find out what has in fact taken place.  Not only is the story-telling first rate, so are the technical aspects: zero G looks like zero G; the details of the spacecraft make sense (like how scientific equipment is stored and how clothing on a long mission is dealt with); and there's an unbelievable craft-landing sequence - so beautiful, so under-played - that took my breath away.  Additionally, the cast is appealing, most especially the pilot, an Eastern European woman who actually seems like someone who flies spacecraft for a living and who makes the most crucial decisions of the journey.

No one is leading this mess, no commander. It's entirely rediculous, the whole thing. None of these crew members were professional, com pentane or effective. They were immature and stupid.

WELL... Europa Report moved me to an EXTREME... HORRIBLE

This movie had so much potential--with a story line that takes you to a supposed exploration of the icy moon Europa... But it just doesn't deliver...

The movie is shot from a POV of a Post Europa Visit... meaning someone is reporting to you what took place on the Europa Mission and what they think happened. The film constantly cuts between the parties reporting on the mission (Post Visit) and then back to scenes where we, the audience, are viewing the crew's life during the visit.... The story is basically hacked or butchered throughout this process, as the director leads you from reporting scene to crew scene, from crew scene to reporting scene and repeats this for two hours... In other words the story is not completely Linear....

The concept for the film/story i think is awesome... Finally landing on Europa in the quest to find Life ( I won't say whether they do or do not) but that concept is GREAT... and the Icy Planet as the Location is GREAT too... but they just didn't develop it as an exploration, which is to say I guess i expected a different Movie, Maybe something like RED PLANET with Val KIlmer, i don't know, which is a Great Movie by the way... lol... Anyway, the movie is definitely a REPORT as the Title Says, not one of survival or exploration as a Editorial Review on Amazon's product page would have you believe.

Anyhow, EUROPA REPORT GETS 1 STAR because that was the lowest i could give it, given this movie moved me to an EXTREME of feeling it was just HORRIBLE...",1393027200,4,1650,4.598639455782313

I'd also like to say that the look as they were showing the moon Europa was perfect. Actual imagery of the planet from probes was blended seamlessly into the special effects so one couldn't tell where the special effects started.

The flow of the movie -- the story telling per se -- was not what I normally like and video diary stuff normally leaves me cold. Especially crap like Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield. The videos were not all over the place and one could tell that image stabilization (thank heavens) was used. And to be honest, the narrative flow made sense -- there were valid reasons for taking the tack they did.  The build up to the ending was enhanced by it so I've got to give them credit for thinking things through.

Spolier Alert - As I was watching this ""found footage"" movie I couldn't help think of the old saying, if you're going to steal an idea, steal from the best.
In his novel 2010 - which was first published in the late 1980s I believe - Arthur C. Clarke depicted a doomed manned Chinese mission to Europa that ended horrorifically when light and heat from the Chinese spaceship attracted the unwanted attention of a multi-tenticaled underwater life form.
Flashforward - sorry Robert J. Sawyer - to 2013 when ""Europa Report"" first started getting a lot of buzz when it hit the theaters in limited release.
I decided to opt to wait and see it when it was relased on DVD to avoid paying the cost of admission and a large diet coke.
Smart move on my part, I believe.
""Europa Report"" does steal from the best, as I previously noted.  The Europa One spaceship curiously resembles ships seen in the first season of Space: 1999; and a Gerry Anderson Production called ""The Day After Tomorrow.""
While ""Europa Report"" does accurately portray the hazards of manned spaceflight in a psuedo-documentary, found footage style, I couldn't help thinking throughout watching this movie is that it was ""stealing"" from the best, while not giving enough attention to crew interaction.

1198488,2,B000009S2E,"Shot in a kind of found-footage documentary style, EUROPA REPORT is a sci-fi movie about a group of six astronauts chosen by a private organization to travel to Jupiters moon, Europa, to investigate the possibility of life. As part of the journey, the crew is extensively taped and photograph: there are cameras everywhere on the ship, including some in the helmets of their spacesuits. The cameras and communications keep sending footage back to Earth on a constant basis. Thus the EUROPA REPORT is a documentary consisting of footage of the astronauts on their journey as well as spliced interviews before and after the trip.

I didn't have any issue with the overall plot of the movie. There are several moments where you had to really suspend your disbelief (I mean, why was there no plan in place if a persons spacesuit became contaminated? And, don't these people know how to follow orders: when you're ordered to come back to the ship after a walk, you come back). However, there are moments like these in most of the movies we watch; the suspension of disbelief is part of what makes a movie a movie.

I also thought the acting was pretty good and for such a low budget film the special effects were well done, too. Lastly, I appreciated how much the movie tried to ground itself in realism.

However, despite an interesting plot, good acting, and decent special effects, I found the EUROPA REPORT to be incredible boring. I thought about stopping the movie after just fifteen minutes into it. Part of this is because the way the movie is edited. The first half of the movie is all choppy: it jumps around from all kinds of different footage on the ship from different time periods and includes interviews with the astronauts before leaving as well as interviews with the leaders of the corporation that sent them after the mission ended. During the first half of the movie there is no real structure or continuity. Its difficult to figure out exactly whats happening and what has already happened. There are moments that I even thought were dream images (this misconception was fixed towards the end of the movie).

Beyond that, the other reason EUROPA REPORT is so boring is because nothing really happens. Much of the footage of the astronauts is just images of them walking around or talking. Thats it. About halfway through the movie things pick up when something unexpected happens (something that was foreshadowed much earlier). However, then it slows down again. Theres a build up when the craft approaches Eurpoa, but even after arriving on Europa, the movie never really picks up. I realize the story grounds itself in realism and tries to provide a more accurate view of what space exploration is like. However, in general, everyday life doesnt make a good movie, even everyday life aboard a space ship travel half-way across the solar system.

Overall, although there is some decent acting, good special effects, and a solid story that tries to immerse itself in realism, EUROPA REPORT is like a bunch of cheap fireworks purchased just before Independence Day: a slow burn that ends in a fizzle instead of a bang.",1391558400,4,3133,4.815985130111524

(Magnet, 2013)
. . .

This low-budget sci-fi film is at the cusp of today's scientific horizons - a speculative journey to Jupiter's moon, Europa, an apparently volcanic, ice-bound planetoid with vast subterranean oceans that is currently one of the most promising destinations in the search for extraterrestrial life. The action centers around a small crew on a manned flight that will take nearly two years to arrive in Jupiter's orbit - experts in their fields, they are challenged by relentless isolation, monotony and interpersonal tensions, especially after a solar flare cripples their communications equipment and cuts them off from all contact with Mother Earth.

Naturally, this film begs for comparison with the glitzy, melodramatic, mass-marketed 3D blockbuster, ""Gravity,"" a popcorn film that became a contender for the Oscar's Best Film category. But where ""Gravity"" has a bigger budget (for both production and promotions), its vision is essentially small, fearful and earthbound. Space is big and scary, it says, we humans are small and overly bold. ""Europa,"" on the other hand, dreams big -- it flings us into the void, dread mixing with exhilaration and awe. This is a film that looks forward into an era of exploration and evolution, which sees humans moving tentatively into a void that is not empty, merely vast, untamed and unpredictable. It may take a while for viewers to get onto this film's wavelength, but the low-rent ""Blair-Witch-in-outer-space"" vibe slowly gives way to an engrossing world that holds its own internal logic, and is genuinely suspenseful and convincing in a way the over-the-top, peril-strewn ""Gravity"" is not.

""Europa Report"" is much closer in spirit to the opening chapters of Kim Stanley Robinson's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Mars/dp/0553560735/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Mars</a>,"" exploring the psychological tensions of space flight, and the tenacity it takes to overcome these challenges. It's not a perfect film, by any means, but it is very good and speaks truly to our times. As society and politics fester and stagnate here on Earth, the stars seems to shine brighter and beckon more clearly, pulling us towards a future that is, perhaps, expansive and bold, and will certainly be bigger and more surprising than we can imagine. Outer space is our new frontier, and we have only just begun to meet the challenge. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1390867200,3,2477,5.428571428571429
1198492,2,B000009S2E,"I chose this movie mostly because I wanted something Sci-Fi.  Right off the bat, an astronaut dies due to contaminating his space suit during maintenance of his ship.  They couldn't figure out how to get him inside the airlock without contaminating the rest of the ship.  This would have been easily remedied with garbage bags and duct tape.

Second problem - they use a subterranean probe to cut through the ice.  Unfortunately, something causes the probe to stop functioning.  Never during this time did they consider reeling it back in on its tether?  This is a mulch-billion dollar exploration using million dollar specialized equipment

Third problem - one of the astronauts decides to go outside to take core samples from the drill.  When ordered back inside, she refuses, opting, rather, to check out the shiny thing - at the beginning of the movie, the narrator mentions the astronauts were recruited from the best astronauts around the world, yet discipline is almost non-existent throughout the crew.

At this point, I lost much of my remaining interest in the movie, opting to do dishes as the last 30 minutes of movie played out.  I watched the ending and was less than impressed.  I don't feel I missed out not watching those 30 minutes.

Bottom Line: What we have here is another ""lost camera footage"" movie of something that could have been a good story if it had been told in a proper context.  This is ""The Abyss"" without James Cameron's story-telling, in the style of the ""hack"" style of film making established in Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity, or Apollo 18.  Most of the characters have little if any development, meaning we essentially watch them die one-by-one without the benefit of feeling loss.  And at the end, we get to see the monster is a glowing space squid thingy.

If you'd like to see a glowing Space Squid wreaking havoc on humanity, I'd suggest you watch Gareth Edwards (2010) Monsters.",1390867200,,1924,4.834862385321101

The only reason the movie didn't get 5 stars was because the storyline was a little confusing as it jumped back and forth along the timeline.  But that only happened a couple of times and you can avoid any confusion by taking note of the date stamp on the bottom of the screen.

1198501,5,B000009S2E,"The premise was fulfilled. Take a very complex machine, newly designed and built, place several space experienced tech-nauts aboard. For the first time send humans, past the moon towards Jupiter's moon Europa, only because a robot craft had detected liquid water beneath thick ice crust. More then a year out to destination, have them deal with all the physical and mental stresses. Expect them to arrive the same people they started out as, and take their unproven machines, land safely, explore safely, discover safely and firstly, send all information back safely, then, if they can, lift off safely, return to their main ship and return to Earth.., safely.  The odds of humans returning safely, under such circumstances are not high. Until many have attempted and died to 'field' test' the concepts, technology and strategies for coping with humans under alien conditions, for incredible periods of time, catastrophes will occur. Machines will fail, people will fail.

 The only thing in the mission that was planned well and had the highest odds of succeeding was the broadcast of knowledge back to humanity. The crew or some members were not given good odds of returning safely. Humans may be the best bio-quantum computers to send out, but they are also the most fragile and vulnerable to failure.  Yes, communications did break down, but that was necessary to the plot, for it made the individuals fight harder to survive, even if they must, individually sacrifice their lives. Someone had to survive to relay the incredible news to Earth.  Of course after they all perished, communications miraculously returned and the shattering news was received. Makes ya wonder, if the aliens under the ice, interfered with the transmissions, suckered the humans down to their deaths, ate them up or whatever, then released the transmissions to entice the rest of humanity to come visit their mysterious world. Humans are suckers for solving mysteries and becoming victims.., we are sooo delicious.

If one is to view this realistically, the plot was sound, the personalities were reasonable. Their purpose and decision making was reasonable, and they accomplished their mission.., which is really what human endeavors are all about. Whether you're sent to dig a ton of coal or gold 1/2 mile underground or search for diamonds on Mars, your mission is to retrieve information and results for those waiting safely above.  The crew must have hope of their safe return to encourage them to go, but they must have some doubts tucked away in the back of their minds, which only surface as one technical or human failure begins to occur after another.
 Even in the midst of impending doom, the 'lone survivor', clings tenaciously to the hope she will make it back.

It was a decently produced and acted presentation of 'what if'.  If you really want to make a difference for humanity 'discover' something significant.  Thus, Einstein, Dawkins, Henry Ford, Darwin, Madame Curie, Pasteur, S. Jobs, Galileo, products like fire, wheels, velcro, zippers, internal combustion engines, Butter, beer, vinegar, planes, trains, cars, rockets. Discover, invent and create Something significant.., and you don't have to survive for it to make a difference for those whole are to come.  Good subtle flick.",1390176000,2,3283,5.138836772983114

This low budget film, shot is what looks like a documentary format, seemed very realistic. This is a great contrast to ""Gravity"", which was a big budget thrill ride. The emphasis on self-sacrifice in the face of danger was very inspiring. SPOILER: When the final remaining astronaut realizes that return to Earth was impossible, she lets the predatory Europan creature into the ship to be videoed although it will kill her. Compare this to ""Astronaut: the Last Push"" (another Europa mission story) where inflicting sheer boredom on the viewer through most of the movie is necessary to understand the final outcome of the movie, with no grand climax as a reward.

There are no real surprises when it comes to plot, but this film was not written as a drama about an Alien or alien life, as much as a glimpse of possible future discovery of life in our solar system.

1198512,3,B000009S2E,"Anyone wanting to view a more scientific technically oriented SciFi film, then ""Europa Report"" is for you.  This flick has all the attributes of todays and near future space programs that shift from NASA to privately funded space travel.  The cast of believable astronauts, never stray from humanistic limitaions.  As travelers to deep space in what appears to be a low tech craft, that's being stretched to the max for such a mission, we are immersed in the crews day to day tasks and anticipation of discovery.  The film really details what may occur inbetween points for such a long journey.  This is effectively portrayed as all communication with mission control is lost and any malfucntion can lead to tragedy.  So expect slow going for the first hour.  The last half hour without spoiling it, lets you imagine as the crew does what will be found on Jupiter's moon, Europa.  To me this is where I am let down.

1198515,4,B000009S2E,"About the same time that ""Gravity"" came out, another movie came out the same year with a similar premise: a space mission's crew and their struggles to survive in a hostile environment. It's a bit like ""Apollo 18,"" in its found-footage format, only much less goofy.

The story is told by the CEO of Europa Ventures, Dr. Unger (Embeth Davidtz), who sent the six astronauts on a twenty-month mission to Jupiter's moon. What unspools is a variety of footage -- plausibly recorded, given that it's a space mission -- in which one mistake compounds another.  A solar storm requires a repair, and when an EVA goes horribly awry, someone is left behind.  SPOILER REPORT: You know, like Clooney's character in ""Gravity.""

To be fair, there's only so many ways to die in space, so it's perhaps no surprise that the two films have that in common. There's also concerns about radiation, air, and the psychological erosion of the crew's sanity.

Things really heat up (or cool off) when the crew lands on Europa and the search for life turns into a battle for survival. As the crew loses its cohesion, as the ice cracks, and options dwindle, ""Europa Report"" takes a decidedly noble turn.  There is no turning back, no calling for help.  The crew is nakedly alone on a hostile planet and it brings out the worst and best in the scientists who have to consider the good of the mission above their petty concerns.

""Europa Report's"" greatest strength is also its flaw: it is slow, leisurely, and occasionally plodding as silent, grainy images show the claustrophobic conditions of the crew. Some of the actors' accents are impenetrable, and at least one actual rocket scientist realizes that going on a 40 month mission is probably not a good idea for relationships back on Earth.

But while ""Gravity"" offered the thrills and chills of a woman against the odds, ""Europa Report"" is content to let its events march to their inevitable conclusion.  A serious sci-fi film that treats its horror tropes with the appropriate weight.",1389139200,,2011,4.802898550724637
1198516,5,B000009S2E,"This is a landmark movie because it demonstrates - and so beautifully - how different the realities of space travel are from our expectations, or what another reviewer called ""chaos on the planet.""  Man tends to have a Pollyanna view of outer space and space travel.  We have such high hopes for ""men in space.""  This and similar movies (like ""Gravity"") should be taken as a warning rather than as an invitation.  Many more recent sci-fi movies like this have this as a subtext, but Europa Report puts it right out there, where it belongs.

The movie is filled with ""black swan"" events, accidental circumstances that result in consequences that seem out of proportion, but that are entirely realistic, like the bolt in the side panel getting stuck.  These ""tiny details"" aren't just incidental, but major plot devices and are what give this movie its unusual sense of realism.

The problem with our space industry isn't with scientists, but engineers, who aren't so much narrow minded as they lack the foresight into just how dangerous space is, thinking we can ""just go,"" as if space travel could ever be safe and ordinary.  For example men in space couldn't rely on help from Earth-based ground control, due to the lag-time in communication between Earth and anyone in outer space. This is why, in the movie, they record messages to people back on Earth.  When man ventures into space he will be literally ON HIS OWN.

One flaw of the movie is that some of the philosophical comments made by the astronauts are garbled or grumbled, like when one female astronaut says something about the ""value of a human life,"" which, even after replaying 5 times on the DVD I rented, I still didn't completely understand, until another reviewer here mentioned to it.  This happens far too often in the movies.

Other reviewers are nit-picky about ""scientific flaws"" but the movie succeeds on every level and is extremely intelligent, so it deserves to be recognized.

As I say in a book I'm writing and about to publish: for the sake of humanity, the exploration of space needs to be guided by hard-edged sanity, not delusional hopes and dreams.",1389052800,12,2133,4.795081967213115
1198517,4,B000009S2E,"I am admittedly not fan or supporter of the Found Footage genre with only 2012's Chronicle being the exception. Since the genre's breakout hit in The Blair Witch Project the found footage genre has been boring, predictable and simply uninspired as writers and directors just cut and paste the same formula that was in Blair Witch without inspiring themselves to create something unique and different instead of the same crap that is turned out multiple times year after year simply because it is cheap to make and highly profitable, so who needs anything new or original, so I was very hesitant about the Europa Report. I enjoyed the trailers of Europa Report still I was hesitant to see it believing it would be the same old crap that I've seen dozens of times before, but after viewing the Europa Report I can happily say I was wrong about the film as it is an homage to great science fiction films of the past and a celebration of the human spirit.

Europa a moon around the planet Jupiter is believed or theorized that life could be possible on the moon for decades as the moon has ice covering its surface, and believed to have oceans deep beneath the surface of Europa, and where there is water there is the possibility for life in some form. Even in recent years scientists are beginning to theorize that there is actual life on Europa. These theories of life evolving even in places with great distances from the heat of the sun has been used in many science fiction films, and Europa has been used has a backdrop for many science fiction films with the most notable being 2010: The Year we Make Contact. Director Sebastin Cordero and screenwriter Philip Gelatt use these discoveries and scientific theories for the backdrop of their Found Footage, Doc*mentary and Science fiction blended film.

The script isn't original or really unique, but I don't think it was intended to be as Cordero and Homage was paying homage to films like Apollo 13 and especially 2001: A Space Odyssey as early on in the film The Blue Danube is shortly played. As always with science fiction films that don't involve aliens slowly killing off the crew of the ship some inevitably goes wrong whether it be an explosion in an oxygen tank like what happened with Apollo 13 or cross purposes programming that lead to Hal killing the crew in 2001: A Space Odyssey. The same thing happens in The Europa Report, which leads to the expected tragedy and loss. While the plot was not original it was well written. You feel as if Gelatt really believes in exploration and the human spirit to strive, persevere and overcome all obstacles to achieve a goal. Gelatt's story is also a call out to the lack of innovation and wonder to go reach father than man has gone before. As for the Found Footage element of the film I can say that The Europa Report won't change my view of the Found Footage genre I thoroughly enjoyed the Found Footage/Doc*mentary style science fiction film. The story runs nonlinear with both the astronauts and mission planners explaining their stories, and how the mission ultimately succeeded. Outside of Sharlto Copley the unknown cast added greatly to the plot helping me to become emotionally involved with the film and characters.

Ecuadorian director Sebastin Cordero does a beautiful job directing The Europa Report. The budget for The Europa Report is miniscule, but it works for Cordero and The Europa Report as this isn't a film about aliens or a film with huge budgeted battles. It is a film about exploration, the human condition, the human spirit and overcome and strive to reach the stars, and Cordero filmed that nearly perfectly. Cordero focuses mostly on the astronauts on Europa One, and with the Found Footage/Doc*mentary style he adds to the isolated and claustrophobia of the crew as well as the interactions of the crew which greatly add to the film, and along with the aid of NASA has created one of the most compelling and realistic films about exploration in years.

I miss science fiction films that actually try to be realistic in story and human interaction with space along with giving you a sense of wonder and celebrate the human spirit to push beyond what is believed humanly possible to achieve greatness and explore the unknown. Moon achieved some of that, and I have high expectations for Gravity; yet films like this are few and usually far between, and while The Europa Report isn't perfect it does achieve all of the above. Director Cordero and writer Gelatt to a great job bring to life a relatively predictable film that almost perfectly blends Found Footage with science fiction creating an inspiring science fiction thriller that is added by strong performances by the cast and music. The Europa Report is not a film to be missed especially if for fans of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Moon, and Apollo 13 as it is one of the best pure science fiction films in years.",1389052800,,4899,4.7330210772833725

Europa Report quite accurately depicts a plausible interaction scenario between crew members hand-picked for a long and difficult mission.  Without giving away the ending, I can say that the behavior of this group reflects the best of human exploration.

Technically, the movie requires non eye-rolling or overt suspension of disbelief.  The space ship is well within the parameters of plausibility, and there are no over the top, gee-whiz devices that take the exploration effort out of the realm of the near-future ""do-able"".

Months later Earth receives a burst of signals from the expedition, essentially the flight recordings of the entire mission. Then silence once more.

But these guys did a good job at it.  The science was OK.  The whole issue of a spacesuit soaked in hydrazine was completely plausible.  Hydrazine is commonly used in thrusters and it's deadly to breath.  I thought the crew was believable also. And that was difficult because a real crew of trained astronauts would not necessarily be the best set of characters for a drama, but they found a good balance here.  Not to spoil anything, but they didn't find a monolith or anything quite so dramatic on Europa. And I was kind of glad the movie didn't try to solve any ultimate mystery of mankind.

So, the mission team does discover a type of algae in ice samples, so I guess the company can now plan on shipping back a couple of gallons to make into smoothies or something.  Or, wait until the alien octopus thingy learns to fly the space capsule back to Earth, and when it does, a sushi chef can make enough squid rolls to feed the cast and crew of Europa Report.

All the suspense and techical gadgetry during the first hour of the movie was unfortunately discounted by the ending.  In other words, it flops, and badly.  I'm only able to choose a whole star to rate this movie, but If given the choice, would rate it 1/5th of one star.  But wait, that blue light, I must investigate further, it's surrounding me...I can only...aaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiggggh!!!",1388620800,7,1140,4.608910891089109
1198525,4,B000009S2E,"I was somewhat surprised by the number of negative reviews here and almost didn't purchase this movie. I am glad I did. It currently has a 79% rating (Certified Fresh!) from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, and I agree with that assessment. (I suggest you read their reviews also.) I find it a solid, but not perfect, work. Here is a list of a few of my thoughts that might help potential buyers (I bought the Blu-ray edition -  very reasonable picture and sound quality; interesting if somewhat short/limited extras):
They obviously made an attempt to be realistic in the science of space exploration.
The special effects (for the stated budget for the film) are very good.
The characters have some basic development and believability.
The style of the film (flashbacks, film archive, etc.) is challenging but at least an attempt to be different/original. It may be confusing and take a little getting used to at first.
Most of the film is understated; this is not a thrill a minute blockbuster by a long shot. It tries to portray a more ""hard"" sci-fi atmosphere - let's face it, 2 years trapped in a small space ship is probably pretty boring most of the time.
While this may be cross between sci-fi and horror, it is definitely biased to the sci-fi aspect.
Again, not as deep as 2001 or Bladerunner or as exciting as Aliens or Gravity, but a solid effort.
For those who panned the film for not having a ""point"" or theme, it does at least ask/try to answer ""What would you be willing to sacrifice to make the most important scientific discovery in the history of the human race?"" That is a more profound point than 95% of all the (some very successful and popular) sci-fi and horror films ever made.",1388620800,,1696,4.6158940397351

1198527,2,B000009S2E,Watching the interactions of a crew is not my type of movie. Some may like this type of story but I prefer movies with more actual action. The last 10 minutes are the best part of the whole film.,1388620800,,195,4.0256410256410255
1198528,2,B000009S2E,"I was hoping for something profound, along the same lines with 2001, a space odyssey(of course not any where close--just along the same lines). It's ok for a boring or rainy day movie.",1388620800,,184,4.606060606060606
1198529,4,B000009S2E,Saw it before theaters on amazon video and I was imprest with it for the most part. Acting was good and most of the space travel depiction was semi realistic. As a space exploration buff I did notice some flaws in the engineering aspect. Like how they were able to generate artificial gravity in the living moduels is totaly unrealistic based on the size of the moduels and the devices used to rotate around it. The rotation to generate artifical gravity would need a masave structure rotating at an efficient speed or a smaler structer that requires extreamily fast speeds of rotation. Even then there would still be sighns of a reduced gravity environment like when walking or dropping or moving an object. If they said reduced gravity instead of earth gravity that would have made more sense. Artificial gravity is next to impossible even in a 20 or 30 year time frame The rocket launch and the departure from earth was realistic and cool to see. The movie is a found footage/fictional documentary style movie and it is allot better than apollo 18 which was ok but wasn't as innertaining as europa report. In the end realisticaly they would send a probe to europa way before a crewed mission. Europa is just to far away it poses to great a risk to send humans there before sending a probe.,1388534400,,1292,4.621739130434783
1198530,4,B000009S2E,"When a sci-fi movie achieves a certain degree of excellence I have special category of greatness where I place such films. Europa Report, the little known sci-fi film of summer 2013 is placed squarely in this special category.

The farthest than humankind has ever traveled; Europa Report takes us to a moon orbiting Jupiter where researchers believe there may be life. As a crew of scientists and engineers depart Earth they tread the well-worn path of many a space movie. Traveling to Europa the crew have their squabbles, their celebrations, their successes, their letters and videos made for loved ones on earth.

Then the lines go dead. They loose all contact with Earth. They have every possible gear malfunction imaginable, including a few mental and emotional ones. Director Sebastian Cordero permits this display, the usual psychological strains the typical sci-fi film character faces, but Cordero keeps them to a minimum. He does not rely on these typical factors to carry the film.
The clichs become less and less important as the adventure of the actual mission intensifies.

Once on the crew arrive on the moon Europa, everything goes wrong. When characters weve become fond of start dramatically disappearing we realize this is not a story about the power of the human spirits ability to overcome all odds. This is intended as a realistic portrayal of a real mission. What it would actually be like to venture to the far reaches of our solar system. It is a stunning achievement.

For 10 million dollars this film transcends basic film devices. The Astronauts struggles to survive become incidental. Europa Report takes us past the mere human crusade of survival. Way past.

Errata: Surprisingly the crew miscalculates the temperature of Europa as absolute zero. Absolute zero is a scientific impossibility according to the Smithsonian. Particles not longer move and energy is no longer transferred. At absolute zero, the principle that prevents perpetual motion from existing which is also used as an adjective to describe the decent into disorder- entropy- reaches its minimum value. The scenes on Europa are overflowing with entropy, so this absolute zero declaration is blatantly false.

1198531,5,B000009S2E,Its a realistic good scifi movie. Who knows what could happen when we finally get to another body in space. I'm sure the life forms could be hard to recognize at first would be interesting. They should do part two about what happens next.,1388448000,,238,4.431818181818182
1198532,4,B000009S2E,"I had missed this movie completely when it was released to theaters during the summer of 2013, mostly because it was a relatively limited release.  Even the local theater that often carries such ""novelty"" films (such as Moon) didn't carry it.  So when it finally popped up as a DVD release I quickly snagged it.

Anybody looking for this movie probably already knows what it's about--the first manned expedition to Jupiter's moon Europa to see if there could be life in the oceans under the ice there.  The story is told almost exclusively in a series of views/recordings from the various cameras onboard the ship, the space suits, etc.  This works pretty well for the most part and is realistic in that that's the type of footage that would be received back on Earth, though it sometimes gets a bit confusing when cameras cut out or have video feed issues (always at JUST the wrong moment!).

The science behind the movie is basically pretty solid, with the production team using the best info on Europa available at the time of the movie's filming.  The ship is believable and there are only a couple of minor quibbles here (there seems to be sound in space when they fire their retro rockets, and I find it difficult to believe that the radiation they'd hit just sling-shotting AROUND Jupiter wouldn't kill them).  There seems to be an amazing lack of redundancy in the various systems too.

But leaving all that aside this is a great ""hard"" science fiction movie.  Well done, believably acted, well scripted.  Very recommended for anybody who's a fan of the harder, grittier science fiction in the same general vein as ""Moon"".",1388275200,,1630,4.74468085106383
1198533,3,B000009S2E,"I think these filmmakers deserve much praise. First, the irony of this movie is that its low budget notwithstanding, by ingenuity and attention to detail, it's a visually realistic and convincing sci-fi film. It takes a much different approach, of course, than ""Gravity,"" but it  works. It's suspenseful and I think it tells a story of the level of danger that would inevitably be present in a manned mission of this type, if it occurs anytime in the foreseeable future. That said, the characters are indeed sketchy and therefore hard to care about. But, it's most definitely worth watching and it's pretty darn intense.",1388188800,2,620,4.961538461538462

1198537,1,B000009S2E,"Another one of these Sci-Fi ""Blair Witch project"" documentary-films that leaves much to be desired on all movie-going fronts but particularly in the way of character development.  Europa Report tries hard to be a sci-fi horror movie but it's no 2001 a Space Odyssey.  It's more like that Moon movie that came out recently which had major flaws in and of itself.  Heavy on the scenery but not so much on creating interesting individuals you think about after the movie-going experience is over.  Unlike the classics, these films never lead you to believe the astronauts are millions of miles in deep outer space with a serious intensity of whatever it is they're supposed to be doing.  Somehow, it always feels like they're in the basement of a hollywood studio or working out together inside a gymnasium.  And on that note, when Hollywood starts making Science Fiction movies with character who don't always act like Shia Labeouf or Will Smith in Independence Day, I'll start paying attention.  Look to 2001, 2010, the Aliens trilogy for how it's arguably done right.  Blending visuals with characters who aren't so damn cloying or constantly over-acting in front of the camera.",1387929600,3,1178,4.974489795918367
1198538,2,B000009S2E,"This movie made a couple of fatal mistakes. There is little or no character development, so we don't give a damn about anyone. There also appears to be no central hero that we want to route for. Ripley in Alien had virtually no character arc and very little character development other than the fact she was a tough cookie, but Sigourney Weaver is so charismatic and presents such a strong presence and the alien concept was so fresh and menacing, they didn't need to focus on character arcs. This movie illustrates why you pay a star actress or actor so much money. No star power? No character development to make up for the lack of star power? You've got to have one or the other. The clips/lost footage falls flat and is at times confusing. Better to tell a straight-ahead story, so we don't know ahead of time who survives. Really badly wanted to like this movie. Even the monster at the end disappointed. It's amazing to me that with so much incredible sci-fi literature out there that Hollywood keeps generating crap.",1387843200,,1023,4.626373626373627

The recent trend toward high-tech, computer graphics, sci-fi movies was at first exhilarating for me, but then became just too much.  (Man of Steel, which I also bought recently, is a perfect example of a movie with too much CG.)
  Europa Report takes you back to old-time, sci-fi movies.  It really gives you a feel for what a trip to Europa would be like for the crew.  And it delivers great suspense. From the beginning, viewers know that something, likely bad, is going to happen.

1198542,3,B000009S2E,"Are you a sci-fi fan? That's the key question around my review. I am. Have been for decades, and this film seems reminiscent of some of the B-movie stuff that has rounded out my experience over the years. I think ""documentary"" style is altogether misleading. They just did one of those hindsight ... from Earth ... here's the story we pieced together after we got the info. Other than that, you're right there with them during the action. (Seriously. Documentary? Haven't any of you every read a book with a narrator who starts by looking back? ... Call me Ishmael and so on and so on. Or are you the Michael Moore generation?)

For B level, ok, not so bad. If you're totally into sci-fi and don't want to miss anything ... even have a good time with on the lighter side. OK. If you've never seen a sci-fi film in your life, this could be extremely interesting and fun and a bit scary ... like for younger viewers. The one big problem for old-timer sci-fi fans is it's basically about finding life on another planet for the first time. Everyone who's ever watched Star Trek etc. etc. etc. has seen plenty of life all over the universe and even in other universe's.

But it's like ... somebody had to do it. I mean ... you know ... in the real world, at this actual real point in time, we're kind of sitting around waiting for this kind of event. Interesting idea, and may be worth exploring further in sci-fi.",1387065600,,1409,4.415384615384616

1198545,3,B000009S2E,"Like the film ""Gravity"" this works more toward speculative fiction than science fiction though it does have some leanings toward the latter. The results are a mixed bag.

Here's the scoop. The first manned space mission to move further than our moon is on its way to the Jupiter moon Europa because there is evidence of water there and, hence, the possibility of life. The mission reaches Europa but technical problems and an unseen force throw a monkey into the wrench.

This is supposed to be 'found footage' film but the multiple camera angles and adroit editing throw that down the tubes pretty early on. This reads like a regular movie. The idea is good and they do their darndest to get the technical jargon right and make it believable. The viewer does get the a good sense of being there with the crew. The problem is that it is a bit on the dull side. Two of the high tension points come later in the film and both lack a certain immediacy. The technical glitch should have been more intense, while the unseen force is too vague. It makes its presence known but there are few clues the crew can assemble to figure out what they're dealing with.

The acting is all spot on. The crew interact with each other in a way you figure a  crew of professionals, spending some four years confined with one another, would act. I suppose that's another point. There are few ups and downs in the pitch of the script. Even during the tense points, all remain pretty even tempered.

This is a very watchable film and those involved worked hard to keep this from being a cheap shot. They strove for believability which they achieved. Unfortunately, they did so at the expense of portraying something that is inherently awe inspiring as something not so much so.",1386979200,,1754,4.573248407643312

We get to see the results and help speculate.

First there are no Gabor sisters, big red spiders, or any fun stuff; at least not at first and maybe never. I guess there is no time for a love story unless it was love of a new planet (moon.)

Second they must have taken photo lessons from the ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999). Sprinkled with lots of flashback, sound bites and other unnecessary garbled video.

1198550,4,B000009S2E,"Somehow, this film makes Apollo 13 look like a stroll in the park.

And perhaps it should, since Europa -- a ""moon"" of Jupiter, better called a ""satellite"" -- is so much farther away than the Earth's moon.  I would imagine that someday, some country will attempt to send a manned mission there, but you have to figure that the chance of successfully getting there, and returning, are as remote as most sci-fi fans liking this movie more than any of the Star Trek films.

And this film is certainly better than most of those, and is even better than most sci-fi films in general.  It is definitely more realistic; the dialog is actually believable here while in most sci-fi flicks, the dialog is always wooden.  As a matter of fact, this film feels more like an actual documentary, which this time is a nice change of pace.  They didn't make the mistake of going with the whole ""found footage"" approach, thank God.  At least from the audiences' perspective is all that I will say to avoid a spoiler.

There are many themes going on here, and some nifty little morals as well.  ""If something can go wrong, it will.""  ""Be careful what you wish for; you just might get it,"" etc. etc.  But there is also a nice nod to sacrifice as well, and there is a scenario where sacrifice is made for the good of mankind.  I actually wondered myself if I would be willing to make some of these same sacrifices, and I'm not quite sure.  People always like to imagine themselves being heroic in a time of crisis but in reality, they'll usually just take care of number one when the chips are down.  Just watch videos taken on Black Friday from your local Walmart and you'll quickly agree.

Surely not a great film, but a very good one.  It will make you think twice about accepting that position at NASA when they shake your hand and say, ""Welcome to our manned mission to Europa!  You leave tomorrow morning!""  I'm thinking that I'll pass and just stick with that stroll in the park, myself.",1386720000,,1973,4.4636871508379885

That being said, there is plenty of action and legitimate fear, the joy of discovery, and realistic tensions and relationships within a team that lives in close quarters for a long time.  It is well done.

As with many goods works of scifi, there is a mystery that must be solved that is essentially scientific.  Beyond the question of searching for ET life, you have to wonder what happened to the mission.  Their work is extremely dangerous, which is very well portrayed, but their inspiration and mission propel them forward.  I liked the way that the recovered transmissions were put together in a kind of retrospective documentary that reveals what finally happened in tiny bits, saving the most significant for last.

THough there were few known actors, I also thought the acting was well done.  It's just that they were techies and scientists, whose concerns were rather recondite, but whose passion is apparent.  They bonded as a team, cared for each other, and felt losses very keenly.

1198565,4,B000009S2E,"Europa Report (Sebasti&aacute;n Cordero, 2013)

I watched the underwhelming Apollo 18 a few weeks before Europa Report showed up on Netflix. Magnet Releasing had been talking up Europa Report for a few months via its Facebook page, which is all I knew about it going in. Now that I've finished it, my initial impression that it seemed like it was going to be an Apollo 18 mockbuster was entirely justified. However, Europa Report is that rarest of birds: a mockbuster that is orders of magnitude better than the theatrical release upon which it is (presumably) based.

Plot: in 2011, NASA discovers heat signatures under the ice on Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. (Those of you who remember the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey may already have red flags waving in your minds.) A private company sends a manned spaceship with the cream of the international crop to Europa to find out more about the readings they've been receiving back on Earth. Captained by William Xu (Shinjuku Incident's Daniel Wu) and piloted by crack jet ace Rosa Dasque (4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days' Anamaria Marinca), the team of scientists heads out into spaceand then transmission suddenly disappears. The film is told in flashback after the whole incident is declassified by NASA. The frame is given documentary-style as an interview with the project lead back on Earth, Samantha Unger (Army of Darkness' Embeth Davidtz), with footage from the mission intercut. It seems that the recorders on the ship were still workingand when communication was eventually restored, there was a lot of archive footage that got sent back...

I'm going to try not to be too spoily here, but it's kind of hard to avoid being spoily for both Apollo 18 and Europa Report whilst comparing the two; consider this a spoiler alert for both movies and proceed with caution.

The main difference between the twoand the main reason that Europa Report succeeds where Apollo 18 failsis that it seems to me Apollo 18 was conceived as a monster movie, and everything was built around that concept. We've got this cool monster idea, now what do we want to build around it? Screenwriter Philip Gelatt, turning in his second screenplay here (his debut was 2011's The Bleeding House, which he also directed), it seemed to me was working from the opposite direction. Here's an interesting cast of characters who are in a small place with one another for an extended period of time going somewhere no one has ever been before. What do they find? It may not sound like much, especially since both movies, with some variations on the theme, end up in basically the same placebut believe me, the different theory vector adds up to a huge difference in practice. Apollo 18's characters are about as original as off-the-rack clothes from the costume department. They're affable, they're capable, and above all they're interchangeable. Gelatt took what often looks like a shortcut in distinguishing one's characterscoming up with an international cast to showcase the characters' diversityand instead used it as the tip of the iceberg, creating distinct, memorable, believable characters with whom it is all too easy to empathize. And thus it is that when the characters in Europa Report run into difficulties, the viewer is much more likely to care about the outcomes of those difficulties here than in Apollo 18. Being able to empathize with a movie's characters is one of the fundamental differences between a good movie and a mediocre one, and Europa Report is without question of the former stripe.

After a few decades' worth of lull, the let's send characters to other planets to find things! genre has burst out of the gate again in the past five years or so, and most of what we've seen in that regard has been mediocre at best. It almost stands to reason that Europa Report, which according to IMDB maxed out in August of 2013 on a grand total of twelve screens, was all but ignored while Apollo 18 opened on a jaw-dropping 3,328 screens two years previous. Hollywood, which these days thrives on a steady diet of massive-budget blockbusters and ridiculous sequels/remakes/reboots of franchises who wore out their welcomes years ago, wouldn't know what to do with a quiet, intelligent piece of science fiction. (Moon. Sunshine. Pitch Black. Titan AE. Gattaca. The Iron Giant. I can keep going...) Fortunately, Magnet Releasing does, and depending on when you read this, Netflix Instant does, too. Unless you live near one of twelve screens in selected cities, you didn't get a chance to catch this on the big screen. It is absolutely worth a rental. *** ",1385856000,2,4596,4.901028277634961

1198567,5,B000009S2E,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Europa Report, but I didn't expect it to be my favorite movie of 2013. Yet, this is easily the best movie I've seen all year.

The story is about a human expedition to the Jovian moon Europa to search for signs of life. However, quickly into the mission, things start going wrong. The crew manages to reach Europa, but loses communications with Earth and finds something they didn't expect. While I wouldn't describe this as a horror/thriller movie, it certainly has those elements.

Europa Report is told through pseudo-documentary footage. Sebastin Cordero utilizes the camera well. He captures the story from unique angles, which makes the movie much more interesting to watch than a standard documentary would be. Even more impressive is his use of silence or still camera frames. In space, there's nothing scarier than several seconds of a silent black screen.

The characters are generally low-key but Cordero found very subtle but effective ways to give each a unique personality. Very quickly, I found myself actually caring about the characters. The acting is generally quite solid and the characters come across believably as scientists and engineers. Unlike say Prometheus, Europa Report manages to remember that its characters are scientists and that they are reasonable intelligent individuals. There are no horror movie tropes here. No idiots petting alien lifeforms and no contrived teenage romances between the crew members. These characters are professionals.

Best of all, this movie never forgets the ""science"" in ""science fiction."" While I can't pretend that everything depicted is scientifically accurate, the movie does at least respect science as more than just a backdrop for the story. There are aliens and spaceships, but more importantly there is the thrill of scientific discovery. The characters are motivated by their desire to learn more about the universe. The movie then raises the question of how far humans - and humanity as a whole - will go in the pursuit of knowledge. When the movie ended I actually found myself wondering how I would react if the Europa Report were real news footage.

Yes, there are a few inaccuracies along the way (such as the fact the crew is able to converse with Mission Control with no time lag from the vicinity of Jupiter), but the special effects and attention to detail are really impressive given the fact that is an indie film (NASA reportedly assisted in the project development).  There is also a refreshing absence of space opera to the storyline; heck, theres not even a romantic subplot to be found among this crew of men and women.  No one breaks down emotionally or descends into madness, either, when serious problems arise.  The entire crew works together to fulfill the mission, embodying the words of one of the crew members: Compared to the breadth of knowledge yet to be known . . . what does your life actually matter?

For those unfamiliar with Europa, it is the smallest of the four Jovian satellites first discovered by Galileo  and the sixth largest moon in the Solar System.  One can easily make the case that it is also the most fascinating orbital body in the Solar System: its atmosphere contains oxygen, its surface is covered in ice, and many scientists believe that a water ocean is to be found below the surface.  Such an internally heated ocean holds out the prospect that some type of life  most likely unicellular  exists on Europa.  After we put men on Mars, Europa is the next place we should be sending our astronauts.  Sadly, that obviously won't happen, given the lack of funding and increasing irrelevance of NASA; even in this movie, Project Europa is funded by private rather than public investment.

A hell of a lot of things can go wrong on a mission to Europa, but this crew does not face a serious problem until it nears Jupiter, when a solar storm knocks out their communication with Earth.  Its unrealistic to believe such a mission would not have a back-up communications system, but it adds a little bit of tension to the plot of the movie.  Determined to fulfill the mission, the crew members have the added pressure of making sure whatever discoveries they make on Europa make their way back to Earth somehow.  Its not like they're just launching a probe down to the surface, by the way.  Their mission is to land on Europa, drill down beneath the ice layer, and see what lies beneath.  Im not going to give away any spoilers of what happens down there, though.

The one problematic aspect about this otherwise great film is the fact that it tells some of the story in the form of flashbacks.  This can lead to some confusion early on, especially when everyone keeps talking about what happened to one crew member when I didn't even know who they were talking about.  That should not deter anyone from watching Europa Report, though.  This film truly does put the science back in science fiction, posing and answering realistic questions as to how such a dangerous deep space mission could play out  and how the individual astronauts would react and function in the face of unforeseen and potentially catastrophic occurrences.",1385078400,,3319,4.70242214532872

1198584,3,B000009S2E,"I was entertained while watching this, but by no means did I love it.

I do agree with the person who recommended it to me that the last little bit of the movie sort of ruins the suspense of the the rest of the film. Prior to that it was pretty innovative in terms of what the scientists on board were dealing with. I did like the focus on science and how very important it was to the members of the crew--to the point of danger for themselves and everyone else.

I also, agree with one of the other reviewers at the lack of believability at the lack of planning on the part of the mission for such things as not landing exactly where you planned--or being out of contact. It seems a bit haphazard like ""have spaceship will travel,"" rather than a group of the best of the people in their field working for what I would think would be years beforehand to come up with possibilities and probabilities.

Suspending that though, its a neat film to watch. Its told as a sort of ""discovered footage"" movie, a la Blair Witch Project. The whole ship they are flying on is rigged like Big Brother to communicate back to Earth. The film from the ship is intercut with film from people back on Earth. It is also not an entirely linear film, as it starts medias res and then jumps around a bit before all the pieces are tied up at the end.

The acting is really solid, and the directing does its job well too. The effects are actually really neat and underplayed (until that last little bit, I preferred them being underplayed).",1384992000,,1516,4.327464788732394

The premise is simple, a group of international astronauts are traveling on a spaceship to Europa, moon of Jupiter, to look for life under its frozen ice surface.  Over the course of the mission, both before and after finding life, they suffer various accidents and episodes of bad judgement that lead to their deaths.  The movie's plot of going to Europa to find life is intriguing and original.  The background of story as laid out in flashbacks in the movie are all quite plausible.  However, the movie fails by the very nature of all the accidents that plague the crew.  Everything from the ice cracking under the feet of our intrepid explorers, to hazardous chemicals spraying onto their space suits, it seems this mission was plagued from the start with one mishap or another.

That was my main concern about this movie when watching the trailer, that it looked like it would be styled as only using 'surveillance' type camera footage. But i'm happy to say it worked quite well, it wasn't like watching parking garage footage, they made the footage look as good as you would reasonably expect nasa space cameras to look in the future.

The premise
is accurate, we do want to explore Europa for the very reasons they do in this movie, so again, it's very doc style even in the sense that it's a realistic scenario. The unrealistic part is how many crew members they send. It costs absurd amounts of money to send every pound into space, and thus every human is several hundred pounds including all the food and whatnot that has to accompany every human, but OK, they needed more characters to kill off. i'll suspend disbelief.

The monster
This is where it'll loose you or keep you, as with the trailer, it's pretty much a jaws approach, you don't see much of what's attacking them cept for this mysterious light, and they are trying to work out just what it is. It's no spoiler since the trailer shows them being attacked and killed, And so you'll either like or maybe hate the way they keep it hidden pretty much till the end.

Summary
They really went for realism on this one, as much as one can expect from a movie anyways, i could find plenty of unrealistic tidbits but let's be honest, they're out to entertain. I think they did a very good job at it. If you want action and aliens and people fighting each other for dumb reasons, then this isn't your movie.

Somewhere between the classic Arthur C Clarke novel Rendezvous with Rama and the Grand Tour novels by Ben Bova, I fell in love with the planets. Reading the vivid descriptions of their surface and atmosphere filled me with a sense of awe and wonder. In works like Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, and Saturn, Bova brings us the planetary system- scaled up in its cosmic-magnitude. We are there to witnessmiracles and to become tourists seeing sites and sights only meant for gods and angels.

Hard Sci-fi delivers the extraordinary in a believable fashion. We stay rooted to real-world physics and the limits of our material universe are not to be circumvented by techno-babble. We need to understand what we don't understand. That pulls us in to the story and also pushes mankind out and to the dangerous reaches of space to find answers about us from them. Them is always the concept of life or intelligence. In movies like Mission to Mars and Red Planet, we find the discovery of life to be the central goal with numerous and unforeseen perils thrown in. A sub-title of Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey is An epic drama of adventure and exploration. Thats the idea of director Sebastian Cordero and screenplay writer Philip Gelatt. I had never seen any of their previous work so I bought in not knowing what to expect. Im very glad I did.

I recently covered Apollo 18 -using the same style of found footage, with the viewer piecing together the entire story, which slowly paces towards a revealing climax. Where Apollo 18 was played for horror, Europa Report plays for hard. We have the familiar broken feeds, the camera failing at inopportune times and the constant glitches and even the prospect of being stranded a million miles from home.

Command Crew

The crew is quite believable and we have actors fleshing out familiar characters with Sharlto Copley [District 9] and Michael Nyqvist [The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo 2009]. The hardware and footage feels authentic and that leads to a nice level of immersion. Theres a small moment ofupset when you find the crew pushing it and your stomach knots up as you start thinking get the hell outta there. That reminds me of an episode of Star Trek where Captain Kirk takes in an opinion from Bones McCoy who votes for survival. Kirk snaps on the P.A. and reminds everyone that theirs is a mission of discovery and personal safety is not part of the prime directive. If you can appreciate that attitude then you will enjoy the core theme of Europa Report. Mission to Mars dropped the space rock a bit with the overly done big-reveal ending. Europa Report avoids this by staying true to its hard Sci-fi roots and allowing small events to have major impact. If you enjoy your science fiction leaning more towards science and enjoy the journey that a well written novel takes you on, see Europa Report.

The film-makers spent their budget, not on flash, but on trying to make it all look as realistic as possible, and that is to be admired.

I'd love to see another film in a similar vein with a better budget and a better understanding of how a mission like this would really be planned.

That being said, maybe this is a medical breakthrough in the making. Yes, it is clearly an effective and safe way to treat insomnia, but I believe it has an even better use.

A research mission to the moon Europa.  A handful of crew.  Shot through the cameras around the ship and crew suits.  Timeline jumps around a bit, which can be confusing a bit, and sort of took me out of the overall experience.  As slow as the film was, the character development felt minimal to me.  I get the basic cardboard cutout, barely enough to hint at why X or Y might be motivated to do their next action.  Not enough to care about them, or their mission.

The attention to detail regarding ""what would be real"" in a space environment is respectable.  But, I feel if they took the time and effort they used to make space good and applied it to other aspects of the film, it would have made it into a hugely superior film.

The ending was expected.  It was telegraphed nearly as soon as they landed and it sure wasn't subtle.  When it eventually hit, I had more of a ""Finally, it's over with"" reaction more than anything else.

Europa Report is made of movie clips from the spaceship and astronauts' vests, put together many years after the mission goes bad. It's cinematographic language is novel, and yes, it is a slow movie since it tries to reflect the real life, real fears, and real dangers the crew faces. These guys are HUMAN, afraid all the time, and on many occasions not really knowing what to do. It is what you expect from a space mission. Not like the smart assess of Gravity, that spacewalk telling each other jokes as if nothing was happening and they were just lying on the beach... Besides, in terms of plot, I disagree totally with a couple of the other reviewers: Europa Report's plot is pretty good and you get scared throughout the movie until the very end which, even a bit predictable, is very appropriate. This is a scifi movie of a great vintage. I would compare it to the original Solaris, while Gravit would stand together with it's remake, also with Clooney, the hero. Sure, Gravity has superb special effects, but that alone does not make a movie great. Europa Report is great, watch it!",1383177600,4,1257,4.641255605381166

That said, the ""found footage"" of the format just comes of as a way to make the movie on the cheap. It does not help that the actual movie is only around 80 min or so, not enough to develop the characters. This too comes off as a way to save on the production costs. As if the director wanted to make sure you understood the low-cost aspect, the movie ends with a still close-up of an LED-eyed-robotic-looking alien. Hmmm, really? 2-out-of-5 points.

Some of this movie is a little reminiscent of 2001 Space Odyssey in the sense that there were some moments that were intentionally slow paced in a few scenes.

As a report it is a very good report but as a narrative movie with character developmental plot where the prime characters gain insight into themselves or into life's big questions I do not think it was successful.

This movie should be done over and reframed so the movie story itself and the actors within the capsule unfold the story, and the narrator is dumped in the waste can of bad ideas.

The special effects, lighting, stage, costumes and action sequences are very well executed, but, the acting and script kept this film from breaking free of the gravitational pull of the afternoon matinee or even the rental.
I find myself comparing Eur-Rep to another (found footage) film, Apollo 18. It's apparent that Eur-Rep was produced with the intention of making the best film possible using the story at hand and the budget available, no slouching here on the directors part. If you liked A-18, then you should enjoy Eur-Rep.
But, I find that Apollo 18 is the better movie, having the very memorable scene of the American astronauts surreal encounter of the Soviet Lunar Lander followed by the creepy & suspenseful crater walk. Eur-Rep does not offer anything nearly as clever.
Though Eur-Rep does have it's own genuine story and explores a person's willingness to risk his/her life in the pursuit of discovery.
Eur-Rep offers hope to humanity, that we are part of something greater in this universe, while Apollo 18 merely made me suspicious of rocks.

The real action, seemingly, comes toward the movie's end, but is really evident, if not readily revealed, through the steady preparations of one particular crew member, then put into action by another, in the following of a simply litany that emerges in the course of events. The special effects are good and reserved.  The landing descent shot is almost a flashback to 2001, A Space Odyssey, effective for presenting a long, unmoving perspective.

While this is a difficult film to get through, I feel many are only interested in ""seeing"" what the ""monster"" looks like. This is not a film about ""that"" even though there is briefly some resolution of that question. The depth of meaning, for me, is on the more human level of a question of purpose, motive and method. Issues of ethical choices made in face of probable or certain failure have always been an arena of interest, especially when surfacing as the only common element of the actors' performances. This is the reason for my 4 star rating. I would still recommend this to all sci-fi fans as a ""must see"", especially those who are willing to take the occasional ""Blair Witch"" and ""Cloverfield"" qualities in stride. While they can be distracting, they can also convey the essential ingredient of unknowing(as something different from suspense), and there is an abundance of that here. After all, how can one know what is unknown unless one looks? I think I'll have another look.",1382227200,2,1072,4.737967914438503

I certainly got the low budget part, but everything else was lacking. The movie has a totally confusing structure. The Europa voyage storyline is told primarily through numerous flashbacks. (And flashforwards to the scientists on Earth who have released the found footage. Or perhaps we should view it as the scientists arbitrarily presenting the story via non-sequential flashbacks. In any event it is confusing and destroys what little content there is.) We hear fleeting, garbled comments about troubling events having happened to characters we hardly know and with whom we have no connection. By the time the flashbacks stop (or perhaps I just stopped noting them), the direction the storyline will take and the denouement have become totally predictable. The film is the outer-space version of the horror flick where the idiot teens insist on moonlit swimming at the creepy lake.

There are, nevertheless, numerous scientific shortcuts taken here and there, but the movie is still better than most where a degree of realism is involved.  For instance, true science estimates the ice crust of Europa to be around six miles thick before giving way to a liquid layer below.  In Europa Report, the ice near heat vents may be only a foot or more in depth -- and no one can say with certainty this isn't actually true, but it provides quite a convenience to the plot outline.

(spoiler alert)  I usually do not care much for stories where all the characters die -- it just isn't satisfying.  I also could not understand why the octopus-like creatures were malevolent.  No explanation is provided.  My other major complaint is why the astronauts sometimes do things that are illogical and would not follow any coherent flight-plan contingencies.

After a nearly catastrophic technical failure that leads to loss of communication with Earth and the tragic death of a crew member, the surviving astronauts must overcome the psychological & physical toll of deep space travel, and survive a discovery on Europa more profound than they had ever imagined.

I hate to admit it but what originally sold me on this film was the trailer. What excited me about the film was the fact that Europa Report was conceived on a real-life event in which scientists, back in November 2011, discovered water beneath the ice of Jupiter's moon Europa. While the film does a good job of creating and maintaining tension throughout it and the story keeps you interested, the payoff at the end just doesn't warrant sitting through its' ninety-minute length. It reminded me alot of Apollo 18 in that respect. That film was fantastic all the way up to the end...then you find out that what was attacking them was<spoiler alert> actually killer alien rocks? <smh> It was anticlimatic, to say the least.

It certainly wasn't mind blowing or super amazing, because characters were just all right (I didn't really get attached to them nor did I love them) and it was not super exciting through out the whole movie. That said, I feel positively great about watching this movie. Planets are beautiful (especially the last planet where those guys landed) and the plot was quite good too. The alien creature was really nice as well. I love movies about space and this is no exception. I gave it 4 stars but it somehow inspires me onto giving it all 5 stars. I am glad we have some new movie that concentrates much on space exploration, the idea that we are not alone, adding some cool alien stunts that aren't too out of place or too otherworldly. I don't know why people on IMDB rated it generally 3 stars, but I think this movie is exceptional It created a start point for other movies that could have the same idea, just executed even better than what this movie did. What I love most about it is that it has no bs., like rallying or competition of certain countries; no Hollywood bs.; not too much action or sci-fi that would make it too unrealistical. I enjoyed the movie and I'd certainly recommend it! Even the cover for it is just beautiful!

This is not the movie for just about anyone. It's not horror, but more like a scientific thriller. It does not have constant action, popping aliens spitting acid everywhere or scientists having shotguns and Bruce Willis being among one of the heroes on the board of the ship. It's different and while some characters at times can be a bit boring, that still tells much about them. I don't know what budget those guys had, but I don't care. If they had budget of 1$ and produced such a movie, would you change your rating from e.g. good to worst? I pity anyone who'd do that! Some high-budget movies can look very unrealistical and not always make the best impressions. I think this is just a good movie with a different, yet simple approach to life in universe.

1198673,4,B000009S2E,"Although this film is not without flaws, it is a wonderful modern and authentic tale of space exploration only slightly into the future.

Though clearly a low-budget production, the sets and visuals create a fairly realistic impression of what an actual journey to Europa might be like.  You feel like you are there, and the gritty documentary style adds to the realism.

The editing and storytelling approach creates some confusion initially since there is some shifting back-and-forth in time as events are presented.  This helps to generate interest, however, and frames some of the key decisions the crew must make later on in the story.

There is a starkness to the scenes and emotional tone of the film that is key to creating its authentic feel.  The movie ""Sunshine"" several years back had some of this feel, but the emotions of the characters are underplayed more here.  This adds to the realism:  people who are really in dangerous situations usually try to contain their emotions.  This results in less characterization than is normal for movie storytelling, but it strengthens the realism and overall themes.

This is a great story concept, and it is executed well enough to make up for some warts.  Anyone with a love for space exploration should enjoy it.",1381536000,2,1269,4.938679245283019

Like ""2001"" the film doesn't spend a lot of time building character, but admittedly this production does a better job, but then what film didn't. In ""2001"" the sell was special effects. The crew of this feature are the best no accent English speaking white/Asian scientists and engineers from around the globe.

Science fiction wise, the movie addresses some of the issues of a Europa mission such as the deadly radiation that comes from Jupiter. Radiation destroys cell structure making the existence of large complex organisms questionable. People are sent to Europa because an ""unmanned probe wasn't going to do it."" Personally I would have sent maybe one or two just to be sure.

The movie utilizes camera logs and installed video cameras on board to give the film a modern hand held low budget ""Paranormal"" feel to it. Indeed, like so many films in this genre, one must wait for nearly the last scene to see a glimpse of ""it."" For me the introduction of multiple installed cameras as a substitute for a film cheapened the production.

If you want a simple feel good movie this is not for you. On the other hand, if you want to feel what it would be like to be a part of such a mission, including its dangers, then this is for you.

1198681,3,B000009S2E,"Europa One is the first mission to send humans into deep space. In ""Europa Report,"" six astronauts are sent to Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, to see if life exists beneath the icy exterior of the planetoid. Studies show that single-celled organisms may exist in a probable hidden ocean beneath the hefty layers of ice. As being alone in the depths of space begins to take its toll on each of the crew members, equipment on the spacecraft starts to malfunction including their means of communication back home. Tragedy rears its ugly head as the crew on the Europa One mission struggle between making one of the most important discoveries in the history of mankind and surviving long enough to actually make it back home.

One of the biggest mistakes ""Europa Report"" makes is that it lets you know very early on that nobody survives the trip to Europa. It would have been even more effective if you had just heard the testimony of Dr. Samantha Unger (Embeth Davidtz), CEO of Europa Ventures, without being told ahead of time the fate of the crew. The science fiction film is presented like a documentary containing footage from on-board cameras and interviews with the crew. As you become accustomed to the crew, you can't help but realize how realistic everything seems. The special effects do an excellent job making this shuttle and its outer space exhibition feel authentic. While ""Europa Report"" does deal with discovering new life, it never seems to overstep the bounds of reality as the decisions made and the related consequences feel logical.

Isolation sets in and the majority of the crew begins to feel its effects; James Corrigan (Sharlto Copley) gets the worst of it. Copley's performance is perhaps the most emotional in the film despite the South African actor having a limited amount of screen time. If anyone in ""Europa Report"" goes through a story arc similar to Dr. Ryan Stone's (Sandra Bullock) from ""Gravity,"" it's James Corrigan. Just keep in mind that there's no rescuing this time around. The cast is fairly solid from all sides, but Michael Nyqvist also stands out. Nyqvist portrays Andrei, the chief engineer, and Andrei's experiences are a bit more extraordinary in comparison to the rest of the crew.

The first person perspective adds quite a bit to the film as does having a camera inside the suits of the crew as you get an intimate outlook that captures all of their facial expressions and emotions. It's a bit disappointing to see so many characters perish so similarly. However when you're surrounded by ice, there's really only one way you can go. The only real payoff is the last shot of the footage seen from Europa One. You'll know it once you see it. Anything Lovecraftian in design deserves some recognition. Coming back to the special effects, while they're mostly very good and add so much to the film they're also a bit funky once the crew arrives on Europa. It's excusable since it's something most humans will most likely never see, but the terrain of Europa is a bit off-balance in comparison to everything else in the film.

""Europa Report"" is never really able to capitalize on the intense atmosphere that it hints at early on. While it does look and feel genuine at times and you're not ever able to shake that wondrous sensation of potential discovery, ""Europa Report"" fails to ever really wow its audience. While it may share similarities with the number one film to hit theaters this past weekend, ""Europa Report"" is no ""Gravity.""

I saw the trailer for this awhile ago on YouTube and thought it looked interesting and different so I decided to pick it up when it comes out (Magnet films rarely disappoint me). I'm glad I got it. The film is amazing. The story revolves around the crew of Europa One and their journey to Europa in search of living organisms. Their story is told through footage from the ship cams and an interview with the CEO of Europa Ventures. It's laid out almost like a Discovery Channel show (that's the best way I can describe it). What I really like about this movie is how realistic they made it feel with it still being a science fiction adventure. It leaves you thinking like ""yeah, something like this could possibly really happen in the future."" The acting is great. They did a really good job on the casting. The soundtrack is incredible as well. Actually one of the few soundtracks I liked so much I decided to buy it.
There's reviews on here giving it 1 or 2 stars because the science isn't 100% correct. You can tell they did their research when they made this but at the end of the day it's a movie. It's not a real documentary. Take it as it is and enjoy the story. I'm in the military but that doesn't mean I'm going to dislike every military movie because their tactics weren't something you'd do in real life. It's a movie.
Some may find it slow or even confusing with how the movie is laid out. If you're expecting something like Sunshine you might be a little disappointed. And reading that it's found footage might turn some people off but I assure you it's not that shaky cam crap.

1198684,1,B000009S2E,"By now, it should be safe to assume that the majority of us have either seen or at least heard about the new space thriller, Gravity.  Arguably one of the best films of 2013, it's safe to assume that (in the not so distant future) there will be a steady flow of space dramas coming our way in a cheap attempt to cash in on the massive success of Gravity.  Naturally, it's no coincidence that the independent space drama, Europa Report, was released on home video just days after the release of the Bullock/Clooney blockbuster.

Directed by Sebastin Cordero (Rage, Chronicles), Europa Report stars Embeth Davidtz as Dr. Unger, the head of a corporation that privately funds an outer space mission, Europa One, to investigate potential life on one of the moons of Jupiter.  In a documentary-style format and using various camera footage shot aboard the space shuttle, Unger tells the story of six astronauts that successfully land on one of Jupiter's moon and attempt to research the surface, which is made partially of ice - a sign that the moon may inhabit life forms.  Anamaria Marinca, Karolina Wydra, Michael Nyqvist, Daniel Wu, Sharlto Copley, & Christian Camargo also star in supporting roles.

Since Europa Report was conveniently released (on home video) on the coattails of Gravity, it warrants a quick comparison to the buzz-worthy blockbuster.  If we use the opinion of James Cameron, who called Gravity ""the best space film ever done,"" Europa Report could easily be called the worst space film ever done.  Much like the great unknown of outer space, these types of films obviously thrive on the simple premise that anything that could wrong will go wrong.  Feel free to look for an outer space flick in which everything is all hunky-dory for its entirety - and in the event that such a film did exist, it would most likely be the equivalent of watching paint dry.  In any event, while Gravity thrived largely due to beautiful visuals, above average thrills, A-list actors, and an easily understandable plot, Europa Report nearly fails in comparison in each and every category.

It's painfully evident that Europa Report lacks a clear and comprehensible direction in regards to who the characters are and what their particular purpose is over the course of this film.  Obviously, Daniel Wu portrays the captain, but at no point does he ever appear to be in command of anything.  These actors and actresses are completely devoid of emotion, dimension, and for lack of a better word - interest.  If the point of this film was to be a documentary-style flick in which viewers were not supposed to care about the characters within it, then it was a smashing success.  But, as far as the entertainment value of the character development, this film is absent of potential.  These characters, portrayed by completely unrecognizable actors and actresses, simply go through the motions of the script, which is nearly a full hour and a half of bumbling around a space shuttle.

The most bothersome aspect of the film is the constant jumping from bad camera view to bad camera view.  Unfortunately, this style of film-making deprives the film of a smooth delivery, directly stemming from the space cams, which take away the experience of watching a movie and turn this film into an outer space version of big brother.  One minute you'll be watching the crew eat dinner and then you'll suddenly be viewing a swing arm and solar panels in outer space - as if they will eventually come into meaning (which they don't).  In a noble act, this film sticks with the documentary-style of storytelling, but just when scenes attempt to pick up, they are quickly broken up by random analysis from spectators (presumably on Earth) who attempt to explain the fallout and existential circumstances of the Europa One mission.  When you combine aspects, they make for a frustrating viewing experience.

While the film's execution is overly frustrating, the story is still on the money in terms of how humanity might one day approach space exploration.  To be honest, there's nothing sexy about this film and is a far cry from some of the sci-fi flicks moviegoers have been spoiled with in recent years, like Prometheus, Star Trek, or Moon.  Still, the authenticity of Europa Report is admirable - as it clearly aims to depict a film that would dwarf the magnitude of the moon landing.  The significance of this story is there, but the emotion is years beyond comprehension, because when/if the day comes that life is discovered on another planet, people might just look back on this film and make a distinct comparison.

Overall, Europa Report is a dismal and disappointing movie to sit through.  Realistically, all you need to know about this film is that six astronauts land on a moon orbiting Jupiter and then fast-forward to the last twenty minutes - where you'll finally ""see the light.""  You'll miss absolutely nothing of relevance, regardless of what happens to the characters along the way.  The climax of this film is it's only saving grace, thus preventing it from earning a complete failing grade.  For a film that's supposed to be thrilling, one could only assume that the most thrilling portions of this film were left on the cutting room floor.  Any other explanation would lead you to believe that the writers and filmmakers suffer from sheer incompetence when it comes to making an entertaining film.  Do yourself a favor and don't even bother giving this film a chance.  The brief 90 minutes of your life which it would cost you to watch this film (along with money presumably) will surely be better spent doing absolutely anything else.

1198686,5,B000009S2E,"I've seen only a handful of movies over the years that have blown me away.  Most of those are now labeled as `classics' in the world of film, and rightfully so; the films in that category are just as visually brilliant as they are in dramatic appeal.  I'm proud to announce EUROPA REPORT should be added to that canon of titles.  This is an amazing film and is a Must See of 2013!

One of the aspects that impresses me the most about this film is the attention to actual scientific detail.  The premise of an ocean existing under the ice layer is one that NASA has recently speculated upon and, like one of the scientists in the film states, we (as a species) have always found life where we have found water.  This makes for interesting speculative science and excellent science-fiction.

EUROPA REPORT is shot very well and looks visually stunning onscreen.  The CG is integrated flawlessly into the film, giving it a huge boost of credibility and allowing the audience full immersion into the tension.  With broad, vivid depictions of the ship and the planets themselves, the imagery of the film is half the reason to watch it.

The taut premise is the other half.  There's plenty of drama to go around in the film, and it starts pretty much from the opening scenes.  Director Sebastian Cordero does a masterful job of blending current story with backstory, and the result is a well thought-out and tightly knit plot.  It never once lags nor strays from where it should go.

I LOVED the ending of EUROPA REPORT, and I think it fits perfectly into the film.  I've read other reviews from folks that said they didn't like it, but maybe they didn't understand it.  For me, it sealed the deal on this epic picture.

EUROPA REPORT is an amazing spectacle, and I highly recommend it.  Be sure and check it out on Blu-ray to take advantage of the beautiful planetscapes and in-depth details.  There are also a couple of nice Special Features to go along with it, including a behind-the-scenes look at the visual effects.",1381104000,13,2016,4.612359550561798
1198687,4,B000009S2E,"Having read so many other reviews of all colours, I have to agree with most of what is said - both good and bad. It IS a great concept but it IS well delivered. It is the story - as we all know by now - of a manned mission to Europa.
Six people are chosen from this but, despite the ""International"" crew, they all manage to speak with broad American accents. Hmm...It is confined, as one reviewer stated but what else would you expect on a spaceship? The shuttle missions didn't exactly have the room to take the dog for a walk. There are no lengthy dissertations on the Meaning of Life, just terse exchanges between the crew. I can see that. I have no problem with the dialogue as it is delivered, any more than I have a problem with one of the crew getting lost in wonder and paying the price for it.
What I DO have a problem with is the head count. Six people go on the mission. FIVE go to the surface, leaving TWO to go on on the fateful EVA, only one of whom appears to be tethered. Wait, let's look at that again. Yes, there are five on Europa and two are spacewalking so where exactly IS the Lander? Busy bi-locating. If it is still attached to the ship - as it clearly is - then we'd have no trouble at all rescuing anybody. On the surface, then somebody is in two places at once...For a film of this ambition, this is a grievous error in continuity and almost sinks it. Kubrick recut 2001 after its release - to this day, I swear I remember Poole's oxygen line being cut - and this would really benefit from a closer look. I often wonder how it is that the audience notices such things yet the filmmakers don't...
Having said all that, the attention to (other) detail is nothing short of gimlet-eyed; the sets are absolutely remarkable and the conclusion serves the film well. I like it..a lot. I think you will too. Just don't call the roll.
For what it's worth, the moniker ""Post Tenebras Lux"" means ""After Darkness, Light."" It is a fitting one in more ways than one.",1381017600,,1978,4.249336870026525
1198688,4,B000009S2E,"I love this film, so much in fact, I am going to watch it a third time. There is something about it that draws me to it. I was skimming through the guide and wanted something different to watch and thought I would give this film a try. The film is slow moving but it is supposed to be about space travel and exploration. I am not a nitpicker when I want to be entertained, so I kept an open mind.
I like the cast especially Rosa. The shots of outer space are captivatingly beautiful.
If we do get to travel to another world out there, just keep in mind that we will probably contaminate whatever we come across and set our feet down on, or wind up in the belly of.

1198690,4,B000009S2E,"As a major science fiction fan, I found Europa Report to be one of those rare sci-fi films that manages to be stylish and smart on a small budget, while still keeping the audience riveted with it's realism and affecting acting. I don't know how this crept up under the radar, but Europa Report represents the best in found footage and science fiction debuts in recent years.

The editing, although jittery, kept it all real, and put you straight on Europa One with our characters. These characters, I might add, although they are typical sci-fi stock (The Strong Captain, the Doubting Scientist) are played masterfully by a diverse and international ensemble cast.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Nyqvist/dp/B003TTR638/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Nyqvist</a>&nbsp;heads the cast as engineer Andrei, and the electrifying&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sharlto-Copley/dp/B002WTOXUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sharlto Copley</a>&nbsp;(returning once more to sci-fi) plays a charismatic crewmember. Daniel Wu commands in his performance as Captain Xu, and the two female leads - Anamaria Marinca and Karolina Wydra, play their characters with affecting realism, and you can't help but be moved by Katya's and Rosa's climactic scenes.

Back to camerawork, Found footage is really a like-it or hate-it format. Some love the realism and the tension it adds, and other criticize the shakiness and cheapness of it's look. Europa Report is one of the most realistic-looking found footage films I've seen. It's really like watching CNN, or your favourite news network. At times it got a too shaky (Though nowhere near Cloverfield level) and the radiation effects were unsettling (But is that the point?).

The plot has got MAJOR scientific flaws, including the apparent lack of planning on NASA's part, the fact that a little bit of hydrazine on a glove kills a crewmember, etc, but I was very refreshed to find that the crew were strong, level-headed, smart individuals, not the recent idjits we've been getting in films like Prometheus (""Oh look! An alien snake!"" ""Let's go touch it!""). *These* are the types of people you would send millions of miles into space. Speaking of millions of miles into space, the effects are, obviously, low-budget, but director Sebastian Cordero shows the type of high-production values that make films like these work so well.

I would also like to comment on the slow, subtly-mounting dread of the film, to the brutal, claustrophobic, desperate climax, ending on a haunting and astonishing (if slightly unforseen) finale. While Europa Report is not *nearly* on par with Ridley Scott's masterpiece, I was reminded of the unstoppable force of the Xenomorph and the slowly mounting terror that grips the crewmates. I won't spoil it for you, but each loss of the crewmember is truly felt, and in some cases, actually terrifying. I also like that the film ended on a bright note. Europa Report and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Contact/dp/B001AH6ZWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Contact</a>&nbsp;(1997) are perhaps the only science fiction films to truly capture the joy and wonder of humanity finding that they are not alone in the universe.

Europa Report is no classic, and definitely aimed at fans of classic sci-fi, and *not* at casual viewers, but a very enjoyable and interesting look at one of man's greatest dreams and fears: finding life on another planet. Claustrophobic, gripping, well-acted, and with amazing set design (Seriously. It actually looked like the inside of a spaceship), Europa Report is one of the better entries in recent independent science fiction. Here's to more of the same in future, and you can colour me...pleasantly impressed. 4.5 radiation glows out of 5!",1380067200,5,3856,5.699130434782608

If you've watched any documentaries about our space program such as 'From the Earth To The Moon', 'The Right Stuff' (yes I know that the experts say it's not authentic but I watched it anyway & recommend it), I think you will enjoy this film.  It's a good idea of what 'would' happen.  Realistic is what I really want to write.  I hope you take a look.",1379808000,6,390,4.287671232876712

1198693,3,B000009S2E,"Other reviews for this movie lauded its close adherence to scientific detail, and that certainly helps it along.  But I found that the frequent time-shifting of events was so distracting, and the Alien-like environmental strobing so fatiguing, that it made the movie an eventual letdown.  Indeed, given that space travel will inevitably be comprised of long hopefully uneventful spans of time spent by travelers doing routine tasks, the movie makes itself unrealistic simply by speeding things up so much.  And, you know, even with my own absolute lack of astronomical experience, I can one hundred percent guarantee that you will not encounter an octopus on any of the outer planets.",1379721600,2,684,5.2
1198694,3,B000009S2E,"I've always really wanted a good solid sci-film that took a pretty realistic view of how things would really work on a mission to another planet.  This is that film.  It follows a found footage type approach, but it's mostly logical and well done.  This isn't a spoiler, but there are intermittent clips to people talking who are not part of the mission.  Those cutaways are not well done, and detract from the movie.  For me, they removed a whole star.  I was going to give 4 stars, but lowered it to 3 because I just felt that the two different groups of footage didn't work well together. Fortunately, the footage from the ship makes up the vast majority of the film, so it doesn't ruin the film.  Overall I very much enjoyed it.",1379462400,2,732,4.417910447761194

1198698,2,B000009S2E,"Ok, so from the beginning, you know something ominous is going on. Furthermore, you resign yourself to the fact you are going to have to wait the entire length of the movie to see what happened and then later go back and correlate the ending with some of the prevailing implications of their journey brought up throughout the movie (in sparse dialogue) in hopes that something profound will be discovered. But, the end of this film does nothing to address those implications. Thus, the whole movie is a wash. The biggest implication and the main theme of the movie in my mind is whether it is worth risking human life to discover life outside of our planet and especially on a moon we will never inhabit anyway. Yet, the climax of the movie veers you into a fantasy abyss that totally negates the previous two-thirds of the film. So, to me it was just a dull ending to a dry movie leaving you to ask why did I bother to dwell on the implications of a mission like this when the writers went in a different direction in the end.",1379116800,4,1027,4.410526315789474
1198699,5,B000009S2E,"This movie feels like the successor to (or perhaps a descendent of) 2001 Space Odyssey. The special effects are perfect; the environment, the action/dangers, and the story are all entirely plausible. Oh, and the premise is both believable and captivating. The one thing to be aware: this is not a space opera. It is, however, a very well thought out, compelling movie with believable yet heroic characters. The acting is excellent, and it's really nice to see some famous faces like Michael Nyqvist  (Girl w/ the Dragon Tattoo) in a movie such as this.

If they make a sequel, I will absolutely watch it! Highly recommended to those who enjoy a more cerebral-focused action story powered by strong characters. If you always need space opera (which I enjoy), then this might not be for you.

The one downside that I will note (other than there's not already a sequel for me to watch) is that the technology and capabilities in the movie are so close or already exist, that it becomes somewhat frustrating that we haven't pushed to do in real life what the movie does already.....",1379116800,5,1078,4.754010695187166

From the start, its very depressing, and it never quite gets away from it.  If you can get by this, or perhaps it doesn't bother you, you will probably find it a good movie.  It doesn't have the over done special effects like most movies, which was fine.  The story line is basically pretty tame too, but probably more real.

Clark's '2001 Space Odyssey'. While the recovered footage type of format feels a little like the recent 'Apollo 18', the visuals are much better and there seems to be more science than fiction going on. Just the notion of taking on this mission is intriguing, capturing the viewers attention almost from the first frames. The fact that there is trouble on the way is hinted at as things begin to unfold, carefully building up the suspense. We follow the crew of six explorers as they start out and their experience is laid out in a number of non-sequential, video clips.

I probably won't ever watch a movie from Amazon again.  The first few attempts just showed ""loading movie"" and nothing ever happened, with no error screen to let you know what's going on.

I was not able to get full screen, could only watch the flick from inside a browser window.  Plus, the audio quality was terrible.  Perhaps it was just the movie, but one other movie I watched also had terrible audio.  I watch movies from Netflix all the time, full screen, good audio, and no hoops you have to jump through.

The limitations of this film are minor, PROVIDED it is watched (1) on a big screen, (2) in high definition and (3) with high quality, powerful surround sound.  If -- and only if -- all these are present the beauty and realism extends far beyond one scene or two, involvement in the action becomes intense, and the sheer reality that comes through one's senses is convincing and powerful.

A cautionary tale: Though I ordered this in HD via Roku streaming, I immediately noticed the picture was soft and unfocused, clearly not HD.  Turns out the Amazon video menu on my Roku, though saying ""HD"" (with no other choices offered), delivered a picture more washed out and blurry than most SD films; even the audio was thin and lacking heft. Bad news!

I couldn't bear to watch more than five minutes before phoning Amazon to complain and demand a refund.  Surprisingly, they were able to correct the problem and route an HD version to my video library at the same cost. HUGE difference!  Rather than a tepid low budget yawner, it was hard to believe this wasn't a big budget spectacular.  Like a fortuitous string of dominoes, the realism made the danger SEEM dangerous, the spaceship (despite a few technical gaffes) a REAL deathtrap and even the characters better rounded and more sympathetic.  In short, everything then ""clicked.""

It is an interesting film with an interesting approach to do this via documentary.  As far as comparing to 2001, I liked Europa Report far better.  More to it for interest appeal and less artsy.  Although, 2001 does have a place in my timeline - saw it first in theaters when I was a kid.  Eruopa flips back and forth between video recall and 'live' type scenes.  It took me a while to get use to it's style and settle into it. It didn't grab my attention like Oblivion or Star Trek Into the Darkness.  So, I agree with the third star rating ""it's okay"".

1198765,2,B000009S2E,"I am a big sci-fi fan. Good ones in my opinion would be Solaris (2002 & original), Sunshine, 2001, moon and there are others that I  can't think of right now.

I'll give almost any space sci-fi a watch, so I was pleased to see the reviews of this film. Realistic and scientific. Well let me say some parts seemed very realistic and those parts were enjoyable. However a film also needs to be nicely shot and involving.  We need to have characters we believe and care about, or at least invoke some kind of emotional response.

This film like so many simply fails in these areas.

Notice the trailer shows us the film through on-board cameras, news feed and interviews? Well the full length film is the same, this is all you get. I hate this style of movie, it feels as though you are forever on the outside looking in and it makes it very distant. I'm not watching a movie, I'm watching camera footage. Great.

Notice how much you learn about the characters from the trailer? You won't learn much more from watching the film itself.

What about Europa itself?

In the trailer we see a lady step out onto the surface of Europa, it's a nicely done shot. That's pretty much all you'll get watching the film. This is the only meaningful exploration of Europa the film makes and it's pretty disappointing.

And despite the claims of it being a different style of movie based on realism and science in my opinion the characters still act irrationally and in a wreckless way just to move the plot forward.

Speaking of the plot, it's done in such a way that you can pretty much surmise the fate of the mission from the get-go, leaving no real mystery.

The comparisons with 2001 and Moon are artificial. This film has no real meaning of message to convey, no real mystery and no lasting impression.

I really don't get the hype, the concept is great but there is just nothing in this film of any real or lasting interest.

At times this film reminded me of Mission to Mars which I consider a poor film. But even that was generally more entertaining than this.",1376697600,8,2052,4.454545454545454
1198766,2,B000009S2E,"I was very excited to see this movie; it's rare to see good hard scifi true to technical detail, and Europa Report didn't disappoint on that front. What ruined it for me was the premise that the crew - selected from a global search of the best humanity has to offer - displayed a complete lack of professionalism in any way imaginable.

While the technical detail of the story was fairly well thought through, the mission operations part was utter nonsense. There's no way a spacecraft on this type of mission would not be equipped with multiple communications system (even uncrewed spacecraft are). An astronaut doing a space walk with neither a tether to the spacecraft nor a maneuvering pack in the suit? Not going to happen. Similarly, no surface excursion would be performed by a single astronaut (the buddy system exists for a reason).

I get that the movie wanted to show the challenges of extended spaceflight for a human crew, but the story blatantly ignores any and all lessons regarding the execution of space operations we have learned to date. So yeah, it's hard scifi in the sense that the spacecraft is propelled by hydrazine instead of dilithium, but the character's behavior is about as far from realistic as a Disney fairytale.

1198768,5,B000009S2E,"This unassuming movie packs a huge emotional punch, and does it in a very small space. Nearly all the action happens in a space capsule, between the six astronauts - but somehow manages that without claustrophobia. The fantastic sets and zero-g scenes make it easy to suspend belief and get with what matters.

And what matters, of course, is the crew itself. These aren't just brave men and women, risking themselves in the grandest adventure the human species has ever undertaken. They are driven to find the answer to one of the most fundamental questions: Is terrestrial life alone? Seeing the answer first-hand, whether affirmative or negative, would be an emotional experience worth any price. Bringing that answer back to humanity has the potential to change everything we believe about our place in the universe. But, for all that, these men and women are very human, and experience human losses in human ways. This movie makes all those dimensions of drama accessible to anyone willing to rise above themselves for a moment.

1198771,4,B000009S2E,"I caught this film on VOD in high definition with a 5.1 Dolby Digital audio track.  I mention that up front because as limited as that is, the film looks and sounds great.  Bear McCreary adds the musical score which is excellent.  I plan to catch it again on Blu ray which will have a lossless audio track.

In yet another twist on the ""found footage"" style of filmmaking (read, low budget), a handful of space explorers head for Jupiter's moon Europa (filmmakers like this destination).  The film jumps back and forth early on as the earthbound scientists are explaining at a news conference, what happened to the mission.  The video results of the expedition have been sent back to Earth after a total lack of communication that lasted about 16 months, if my math and memory are correct.

Without giving too much away, we know right off the bat something went wrong and certainly the fate of the crew and the expedition are in serious doubt.  The movie has a nice cast.  Embeth Davidtz is the woman in charge of the mission and the news conference.  The crew includes the mission commander (Daniel Wu), Sharlto Copley as an engineer, Michael Nyqvist as his boss, Karolina Wydra  and Christian Camargo as  science officers, and Anamarie Marinca as the pilot.

While the film bleeds of Kubrick's ""2001,"" it felt most like another great low budget sci-fi film called ""Sunshine"" from 2007.  I don't want to spoil but I will say that the mission gets to its destination.  This is one of those rare science fiction films that emphasizes the science over the fiction.  Most of what we see today are action films set in a visualized future.  Nothing wrong with that of course, but here is a film of space exploration with enough scientific jargon to make Neil deGrasse Tyson salivate.  The movie is a little claustrophobic in that most of the scenes are inside the space vehicle, obviously due to budget constraints.  Still, this film is a winner.",1376524800,5,1941,4.689349112426036

1198786,1,B000009S2E,"At first, it was just that Amazon hated my devices.

I decided to download the movie onto my phone and project it (I have a pico projector and the necessary adaptors.) After installing the necessary app, I got a screen refusing to show the movie through an HDMI cord.

Fine, I thought, let's mirror it on my Apple TV. Also not ""allowed."" So I settle on projecting from a mirrored computer screen, which works.

THEN amazon insisted that I had a bad internet connection. Ran a speed test, checked the forums, reloaded the page, tried a new browser, nothing improved the experience. It would stop to load, go pixelated, generally ruining the experience. Eventually, it got too infuriating and I had to go watch it elsewhere after paying money to watch it on this bunk service. There is absolutely no way Amazon can compete with other streaming services if this is the way it goes. FIX THIS, AMAZON!",1376352000,6,896,4.658227848101266
1198787,3,B000009S2E,All the hype surrounding this movie and the small list of theaters that were showing Europa made me want to see it even more.  So much of the story plays out aboard the space ship.  The scenes were stunning but the acting was so predictable.  I will not spoil it for those that have not seen it.... for me it was OK but not up to my expectations of what I thought was going to be a great movie.,1376352000,3,394,3.962025316455696
1198788,5,B000009S2E,"This is indie sci-fi.  Hence, it has flaws, partly due to the limitations that it gets from being ""indie"" as opposed to a Hollywood-funded gig.

With that said, this haunted me.  The hard-science aspects of it are pretty good, at least in terms of plausibility.  (Don't get stuck on the fact that some of the footage is of actual rockets that couldn't possibly launch a major interplanetary craft or other details like that...)  There are other tidbits that as a true space-nut I could nit-pick, but what I really liked was the fact that it seemed like the film makers made a real effort to ask ""What if we did have a mission like this?  What would be the things that could realistically go right or wrong?  How would it affect both the people involved and the people back on Earth?""

There are aspects of the movie that seemed like they were heading toward ""thriller"" territory, but they really didn't get there.  Sure, there's dramatic tension and some usual movie tropes, but not the ones that usually piss me off about more recent sci-fi.  What they found on Europa didn't ""get them"", and when bad things happened, it wasn't a good-guy vs bad-guy situation or a rogue crew-member does something wrong type of situation like so often happens in movies.  What they portrayed was more about passionate scientists making the best of what they had and sacrifices for the good of each other and in the pursuit of knowledge.  Sure, that's also drama, but it didn't feel like things that were written or portrayed just for the sake of drama.  It felt more like the type of things that the crew of such a mission really might have happen and really might react to in such ways.

The movie does follow a non-linear and found-footage sort of format, which might bug some folks.  I generally don't like that sort of thing, but it worked well enough for this one.

Hey, if nothing else, I enjoyed this movie as a geek, and it made me wonder again why people are so willing to spend resources fighting each other when there's so much still to explore about our universe and so many possibilities to discover something great.",1376352000,139,2114,4.597333333333333

It tried to be a ""found-footage"" and semi-documentary style movie, but was plagued by poor acting and quirky editing and cinematography. The best parts of the movie were the visuals. The science was acceptable and moderately believable but the cast and acting were typical and predictable.

Its strength is by far the storytelling - this low-budget, indie film refreshingly builds a suspenseful, realistic plot and interesting character development through clever writing and a solid script. Refreshingly, special effects are kept to a minimum - I saw this as a huge plus considering the excess of big-budget, blockbuster type films out there today. Developed with help from NASA, I enjoyed how much research was clearly put into the feasibility of the space mission, technology, etc. Well worth a watch by any science fiction fans, and especially those who would enjoy a break from the typical action- or effects-oriented movies in favor of being told a good story.",1376265600,60,770,5.070866141732283

  The science was pretty accurate at least being true enough which if you watch the Featurette, they really went to great lengths to make it as accurate as possible.  Yes, OK some other people on here are ball busters of science, pulling out all these physics law etc... For a small budget movie what do you want?!?  If you compared this to other BIG budget Sci-Fi's, hint hint --> Prometheus, I was sooooooo disappointed with this film over the ridiculousness and how far fetched it got.

It's a joy to see an actual science fiction movie instead of a bloated, deafening, stupidly macho display of ways to waste two or three hundred million dollars for the momentary amusement of teenagers.

Europa's science falls short sometimes - their launch rocket and space vehicle are too small, their ice too thin. But it doesn't matter. Come have a genuine adventure with a small group of bright, trained, devoted people doing a startlingly real job-of-work. Gee, maybe a few more 'real,' honest movies like this and the United States could decide to get its couch-potato butt into space again.",1376179200,4,766,5.227642276422764

It is wilderness adventure at its best, keeping you on the edge of your seat until the end.  I was extremely impressed by this small(?) budget effort coming from the fringes of filmdom:  TOP-notch effects, cinematography, subject matter authenticity and overall production values.  Every dollar spent on this movie is evident on the screen.

Is the film perfect?  Nope.  The characters are sometimes a bit over the top but, hey!, it ""makes good theater"" -- I'm quite sure that any real astonauts selected for such a mission would possess better composure & professionalism, better interpersonal communication skills, and more heroic ""can-do"" attitudes.  The movie's spoken dialog is often quite ""muddy"" and difficult to understand, and some of the technical details driving the story action are occassionally confusing.  And some ""reality"" flaws that conflict with physics, engineering, and known planetary science still manage to sneak in;  I'm willing to look the other way.

But on the whole, this is FINALLY a WONDERFUL vision of what REAL manned space exploration can be about.  It is comelling stuff and will hopefully inspired more of Hollywood to forego the monsters and instead rely upon the abundantly available adventure material that actually exists.",1376179200,10,1522,5.4297872340425535

I kept flashing back to the closing warning on ""2010"" but ""Europa Report"" is a good story that easily stands on its own and does not depend on ""2010"" for any part of the story.  A very interesting (and unanticipated) ending.

The relationships between the characters made the story very believable.  You also developed an appreciation for the isolation that developed over the voyage.  The only thing I felt was that because there was a lot of inter-cutting of timelines it is a bit hard to follow (for an old man).  I expect that younger viewers who are ore use to storyline jumping around will not find this a problem.  As I said, I will watch it again tonight (before my 24 hour rental expires).

I liked the way the whole screen was used to present multiple images, essentially a multimedia display system.  Europa Report may even be a three viewing movie to appreciate everything that is going on.

The cinematography (I guess is what you would call it) makes absolutely no sense and makes for a VERRRRRRY boring movie. e.g.,

--Scenes bouncing from time frame to time frame (22 months ago one moment 6 months ago the next) with no transition or explanation.

--At least 15 minutes of one still scene on Europa that you can barely even make out what it is.

--Numerous still scenes of complete inactivity on board the ship, nearly a 100 or more.

--At least 5-7 scenes of total blackness for no reason whatsoever. Starts out of with multi split screens showing differnt cameras throughout the space ship (which are showing absolutely nothing as well) and then each screen goes blank one at a time until the entire screen is blank. Terrrrrrrrible!!!!

--At least 15 minutes of the camera showing nothing but the astronaut's face in the space helmet, while they're telling other crewmembers what they're seeing, or just numbly staring. One other 1-star reviewer said it best, action is implied. WTF?!?!?!?!?

There is really ""nothing to see"" in this movie but people talking. No spectacular spacescapes, no cool computer graphics, no action scenes, nothing!

If you want to see a movie where the biggest draw is, during the last 5 minutes of the movie, mission control praises what the initial explorers have done for mankind, this movie is for you.",1375920000,11,1365,4.878787878787879

1198817,3,B000009S2E,"I always try to find a way to like space movies. What I like about this movie is the modern take on space sci fi.

There's more emphasis on science too, and how important and valuable it is. There are plot weaknesses, but there is a core message that has virtue. I'm not sure the film will get wide release. I hope it does. But I'm glad I could see it on Amazon fairly inexpensively.",1375747200,,538,4.39
1198818,3,B000009S2E,"I enjoyed this documentary style film.  It wasn't a big budget high action Special FX film; but the visuals were good and so was the story.

But instead of unrealistic monsters and cliche deaths, this film kept the story grounded in current science possibilities and accidental deaths that are very real threats when exploring new worlds.",1375747200,2,385,4.892307692307693
1198819,4,B000009S2E,"This movie is a 'found film' type conceit, where a manned mission to Europa is replayed after the fact using footage recorded by various fixed and handheld cameras.  The space and technology design and effects are virtually flawless, meaning that for the most part they are functional, realistic, and non-dramatic.  This may or may not appeal to you, but as a technologist it geeked me out to see a movie set in space that at least tried to obey the laws of physics and tried to hew to the likely realities of near-future, interplanetary space travel.

However, just because there aren't any laser blasts or transporters doesn't mean that nothing happens, but what happens is more story-driven than effects driven.  The mission encounters...challenges...along the way, and ends with an...event.  I don't want to give too much away, but suffice it to say that, intellectually, a *lot* happens.

The fact that that ""lot"" is experienced by trained professional astronauts who are not prone to melodramatic emotional responses means that you have to infer or deduce a lot of the 'action', sort of like a sophisticated sitcom with no laugh track or live audience responses.

To put it in Hollywood pitch terms, it's 'Apollo 13' crossed with '2001', with a dash of 'Cloverfield'.  The actors are all unknowns (to me), but they do a great job embodying their roles.

I'm giving it four (instead of five) stars because although I thoroughly enjoyed it, I felt that with just a tweak here and an adjustment there it could have been transcendent instead of just greatly enjoyable.  That being said, it's parsecs ahead of other recent science fiction cinema, so if I were grading it against that cohort (and not against its potential) it would get six stars!",1375747200,3,1747,4.91156462585034

1198833,2,B000009S2E,"Let me say that I'm a BIG fan of both real-life space exploration and sci-fi films (including sci-fi horror). SO, I really REALLY wanted to like this film.

Sadly though, I cannot recommend it.

The problems come not so much from the idea, which is good (a manned mission to a moon of Jupiter to search for signs of extraterrestrial life). It's the execution that causes the film to come apart at the seams.

First off, the 'found footage/documentary' angle is getting pretty old and tired. It adds little to the film beyond a bunch of annoying 'camera flickers' and bobbles, and a lot of hyperactive and unnecessary jumping around from camera to camera inside the ship. As (over)used, it's a distracting and annoying gimmick.

Secondly, it doesn't help that we care about basically NONE of these characters. Not even Sharlito Copley (of 'District 9' fame), who just isn't given enough time or space to develop before... well, let's just say it's not good. In fact, each and EVERY one of these characters is here simply as a version of 'Ten Little Indians', to be killed off one by one, in order to present some sort of 'dramatic tension' that the (rather basic) script is lacking.

Unfortunately, you don't gain any dramatic tension from killing off characters that no one cares about in the first place.

Then there's the matter of how oddly dumb all of these allegedly 'best of the best' astronauts are. They routinely (and unrealistically) break protocol, and get killed every time for it. Nor do the survivors ever learn from this. Honestly, you could've sent the cast of Two and a Half Men, and they'd probably have a better survival rate.

So, we get a crew of astronauts who are both strangely incompetent *and* whom we're uninvolved with as characters. The most common excuse given for this is that, as scientists and engineers, they would be unemotional professionals and thus hard to get to know. But contrast this with something like Apollo 13 (the Tom Hanks film)... the astronauts there were both believably competent/professional (in other words, believably astronauts) AND fully realized three-dimensional characters whom we did care about. Without that, that film would've lost a lot of its impact.

Europa Report, while a different film and its own experience, definitely could've used some of that same touch... relatable 'human' characters who involve we, the audience. Nothing is really added by keeping the crew at arm's length, it's more an excuse for ham-fisted and unimaginative writing.

Moving from the scientists to the science, the film does try to be hard science, but this winds up being a very secondary consideration, as the latter half of the film devolves into a very standard ""Ooh, there's something scary out there"" horror movie.

Why the big shift? Probably out of an (unfounded?) fear that the audience will be bored to tears otherwise. Fans of this film will probably dislike comparisons to the (pretty awful) Apollo 18 sci-fi horror film, but yes, there are a number of similarities, and sadly, Apollo 18 probably comes out ahead in terms of entertainment value.

Btw, and *SPOILER* (skip this paragraph if there's any chance you'll see it): The 'this is hard science!' angle goes right out the window in reference to the monster. It makes ZERO sense that a naturally-occurring underwater creature would be adapted to breaking through many meters of ice and attacking (non-existent, until the astronauts show up) surface prey in conditions of incredible extreme cold and almost total vacuum, which is what Europa's surface is. Also, ice is literally as hard as stone at such temperatures.

But the sad thing is, chucking realism out the airlock halfway through doesn't buy the film anything, because it probably wasn't a good choice in the first place to try to be a monster movie when your budget's so tight you can't even show the actual monster attacks (CGI's expensive, yo).

Nor do the science and realism funnies stop there, which is sort of odd for a film that claims scientific realism.  Some examples:

- Europa's gravity is even less than Earth's moon... yet once the crew gets there, no one in the film even remotely moves or 'bounces around' like they would under low-grav conditions, it's just 'business as usual'.

- Europa orbits within Jupiter's extremely powerful (and deadly) radiation belts, so even 2-3 hours unshielded on its surface will cause a human being serious radiation sickness (and no, spacesuits will not effectively shield you). Yet, a crew member on the surface asks to extend her already-too-long-and-dangerous EVA by an hour... and the mission commander *okays* it??

Or, put another way:

Crewmember radioing in: ""Hey Commander, I'm not quite radiation-poisoned enough out here yet. I really do want the whole nausea and vomiting thing, plus I think being bald is a cool look on a woman. Can I hang out here on the radiation-blasted surface for another hour, until I get well and truly sick? Whaddya think? Over.""

Mission Commander: ""LOL, you so crazy. Well okay, but just this one time. You go girl. Over and out.""  (Would never happen).

- The main ship has huge solar panel arrays on it. Why? Out at the orbit of Jupiter, where Europa lies, you only get 4 percent as much sunlight (and thus, 4 percent as much solar power) as you would at Earth's orbit. Solar panels would essentially be dead weight for most of the mission, and such a mission would not allow for any dead weight. Like it or not, a small nuclear reactor would be the logical/likely power source for such a mission (and yes, you can build 'em that small, look at nuclear-powered submarines... and you can go smaller than that).

- Why would the crew 'vote' on an EVA? Such a mission would have a firm chain of command that would decide... it's not a democracy. And why would the EVA ""have alway been a maybe"", to quote the commander? Such things would've been decided and planned/choreographed well in advance. Ditto the whole mission being thrown into turmoil just because they landed a small amount further away from their landing site than originally projected. They would've had better mission-planning than that.

- Oh, and let's not talk about how unrealistic it is for astronauts to do spacewalks without either tethers or thruster packs. Just don't slip, right guys? Right guys? Oops, too late. But man, floating away into forever is just so sad and DRAMATIC, even if it was so very easily preventable. Also ignores the fact that the ship could've fired thrusters laterally and done some sort of sideways 'low speed chase' at least TRYING to save said floater. Oh well, we didn't care about that guy anyway.

Now in most sci-fi films, you could see obviously blown details of this type, roll your eyes briefly, and move on. After all, who CARES if Star Wars is scientifically accurate? But Europa Report is a different kind of sci-fi film, one that relies heavily on the feeling that this is a story that *could've* happened (the only real point to the 'found footage' schtick and camera gimmickry/goofiness).

Thus, the film (and its fans) have been hyping its 'realism' to no end... but really, it shouldn't, considering that it only goes halfway there at best. Nor does claiming Europa Report is more realistic than your average sci-fi movie carry much weight. More realistic than what? Star Wars? Event Horizon? Armageddon? What isn't?

Really, the problem with Europa Report and its big 'monster movie' tonal shift halfway through (among other things), is that the film ends up not being hard science *enough* or serious/exploratory enough to satisfy the space geeks (of which I am one), nor is it nearly scary or spooky enough to satisfy the horror fans (of which I'm also one).

Thus, Europa Report commits to being a 'tweener' film that seems to desperately want to be all things to all people, but winds up doing nothing very well (which is usually what happens when you try to be all things to all people). Not even its somber ""the sacrifices we make for the greater knowledge of all Mankind"" angle at the end can save it... it feels like a last-ditch attempt to give all the silly, mostly-improbable deaths - of again, characters we don't care about - some meaning.

Yes, space IS dangerous, and yes, the first crews to venture out that far will be brave souls, capable of sacrificing themselves for a higher good... but if a few of them do perish, you can bet it probably won't be in the hokey, B-movie ways depicted here, and they'll definitely be much more interesting and compelling individuals than the unlucky and dull lot of Europa Report.

The good stuff? Well, there is some. The general *idea* of exploring the outer solar system has big-time appeal to a true space-buff such as myself.  Many of the smaller scientific details are handled well and realistically. The guy who plays the Russian engineer (Michael Nyqvist) tries and almost succeeds in being an interesting character, even with the script fighting against it. And there is one (and only one) strong scene, a real 'money shot' of the icy, brilliant-white surface of Europa during an EVA, with Jupiter hanging large and shadowed in the black sky. It's the one and only time you feel anything approaching the awe and wonder you're SUPPOSED to feel in a film about this sort of subject matter.

It's a compelling moment, and the only memorable one of the entire movie. If only the film had embraced more of THAT and its implications instead of trying to be some third-rate Alien knockoff, we might've had something truly special here. But that one scene by itself isn't worth the $7 and 90 minutes I put into this film.

Pass. There isn't much to see here. Because in the end, Europa Report doesn't trust its audience, nor does it entertain them. You have to do one or the other, and preferably both.

1198836,4,B000009S2E,"If you've read all these reviews, you've seen how polarizing this flick is, and I won't bore you with a plot summary.

Not a perfect flick but I give it a big hell yeah - nice to see someone try to do something with some scientific realism. It's tough to balance hard science with suspense and story (Even ""Apollo 13"" added a bunch of unnecessary drama, and it's a gold standard to many reviewers of this flick). Nice to see ""go ahead, make my day"" tough-guy-hero lines replaced with ""We've come this far, it's worth a risk for science"". As for the ""found footage"" genre - in this case I felt it worked fine - we take in so much of our vision of the world through security cams, news footage, and personal youtube files, and it was a good way to add some mystery to the proceedings. Chopping the flick up temporally? Maybe not needed, but it didn't ruin it for me.

The low budget comes into play in the third act - a lot of things that should have been epic in scope felt like ""ran outta money"", and the narrowing of the field of view (astronaut's POV's got awfully tight and dark) made it dang hard to see what was going on. And yeah, the first big ""discovery"" felt like one helluva lucky break - we can nitpick all day. But all in all, it's a wonder this flick got budgeted, and it was nice to see a director not rely on million-dollar giant-scale effects shots where story should go. If you like your sci fi to have some brains, support this flick. Overall it was pretty cool.

1198904,3,B000009S2E,"Watched on Amazon Digital before the movie was in theater.  I think it's really more suited for television than the big screen.  I would have been very disappointed to have spent $50-60 for the movie and snacks for two.  It reminded me greatly of ABC's short lived 'Defying Gravity' though it lacks that series mumbo-jumbo.

It's one of the better produced 'found fiction' genre pictures.  The plot is set a few years into the future when a private corporation funds a manned mission to Europa to investigate if there is life beneath the surface of the ice.  The mission is followed from beginning to end by web cams.  This provides a terrific element of realism to the story.

The plot is a lot like what you'd see in a Science Channel or Discovery Documentary.  The head of the Corporation and the Cheif Science Officer of Mission Control provide narration.  The scenes cut back and forth from a spot in time where there was a communications problem that cut off access to Mission Control on Earth.

Though the preview hints that this is an alien type horror movie it is not.  While there is a lot of chills and drama they come from typical dangers astronauts face in outer space most of them due to poor decisions.

One of the problems with the film is that scenes jump back and forth in time.  One minute they are on Europa and the next they are showing another situation that happened weeks earlier.

It was a nice film with good acting, some mystery, and great special effects. It does seem very familiar though as there are some scenes we've seen before in '2001', '2010', and the aforementioned 'Defying Gravity'.  Speaking of '2001' it seemed to me I was watching the crew of 'Europa I' like HAL9000 must have watched Dave Bowman and Frank Poole on 'Discovery'.

The film has all the elements of what space flight can be - the boredom of long missions, the seconds of sheer terror and the burning desire to get the job done.

The ""found footage"" editing can be a little off putting at times, and the story is a little disjointed in places, flash-forwards and flash-backs occur nearly back to back and can make it hard to follow the plot in a few places.

The film does have its flaws, which I won't spoil, but there are about 3, maybe 4 big plot holes or cliches that made me cringe when I saw them. At least 2 of the plot holes could of been done better just by virtue of not falling back on the ""weak link failure that imperils the crew"" device.

If you ignore the worst of the plot holes and devices, it is an engaging film. Certainly echos what some of the current conditions are like on the space station (and long term isolated  missions in general). Minimalist cast and staging helped to keep the plot focused and the sense of the crew's perseverance to get the mission accomplished certainly kept the show moving.",1375315200,,1230,4.400881057268722

It ultimately forces the debate of value on many fronts, the value of human life, the value of monetary investment in our space program, the value of unbridled exploration and fulfilling educated imagination.

When I heard about the movie and the opportunity to watch before it went into full circulation I was a bit put off by the $9.99 rental. Instead I sat on the idea of watching it until I realized the cost of a theater ticket. The gamble paid off in the realistic appearance of the landing on Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. I found the whole thing quite believable. Using relative unknown performers helped except for my recognizing Copley, Nyqvist and Davidtz. Nonetheless their acting helped me along rather than hindered. I have especially liked Copley since I saw him in District 9. He seems to like to involve himself in ultra-realistic movie ventures.

Overall the movie was a worthwhile investment in entertainment. I am sure it will be remembered for the success in meeting its objective of believability. I would definitely like to see it again!",1374969600,,959,4.77710843373494
1198929,4,B000009S2E,"The premise: a non-governmental exploration of Jupiter's Ice Moon - Europa, hense then name of the ship and mision.

Created in the fashion of multiple scenes at the same time (which always underminds movies that have theatrical release due to the ""break in the story"") actually works because of the ""presentation"".

The Sci-Fi element is minimal due to the strong reflection of reality as experienced by astronauts in long duration space travel, yet everything tht brought tension was not some convienently contrived issue, but a consideration of what realy can happen.

Is there a Fiction element to this movie -- yes, but I won't spoil it for you -- you just gotta watch the movie.

Is this worth the watch? yes, especially if you have any interest in space related themes. It is better than most space themed movies that hollywood has put out without an actual historic event to ""dramaticly"" re-enact.

Those who think it was a bad movie are used to the multi-million dollar films that hollywood puts out like harry potter and star wars where lights flash and the music thunders in the ears. The sound track in this movie helps to keep this from being the kind of boring nasa release, but is not the basis of the story (both harry potter and star wars would have flopped if they could not have had a music score to hold the story rolling on - in those movies it was the music that made them great (or good in the case of Harry Potter), in this one the story is facinating enough that once you start, you just want to see it through and then you realize that the music was there too. This is one movie that will be worth adding and keeping in the movie cd library.

If there is a choice between promethius and this movie for which to watch or is better -- Europa Report wins!!!

Ya gotta watch at least once. Just wait until the rental is below $3 cause no movie is worth renting for $10 -- I had thought I was buying it when I agreed to the price... oopppss on me.",1374883200,,1968,4.419889502762431

I have to admit that my main hook for spending the money to see this was not so much the space travel, but to see the cinematographer's vision of  Europa's seas and ice-covered terrain.  I was looking forward to seeing some form of mountaineering on another world.  This was dubbed a ""realistic"" film so I was hoping to be in for a treat.

What bits of the terrain (above and below the surface) you got to see were realistic and fascinating.  It made me want to strap on crampons and go exploring.

Surface travel (the part I was most looking forward to seeing) while visually stunning, was simply not believable.  You see her flying up steep terrain as an icon on the ship's topo map, then you see the impossible glossy ice terrain she is traversing in a bulky space suit with no mountaineering capabilities = no way in hell.  At least show her slipping or something to make it seem difficult.  They did mention it took her an hour to go 100 meters.  Don't know why, she didn't break a sweat and wasn't out of breath and was seen hauling butt on the topo.

Since it was shot to appear like a documentary, it would have been cool to throw in more lesser known observations/theories of the terrain or oceans beneath - like they did with thermal venting, which I thought was cool.

And finally***spoiler alert***:  Wish the final camera images of the ""thing"" could have been more creative and shown us something other than a glow in the dark version of what is in our own ocean.",1374883200,,1535,4.435714285714286

1198939,5,B000009S2E,"Europa Report, released by the limited theater-style company Magnet Releasing, the film is set in the near future (around 2061), where a group of astronauts are sent to Europa, one of Jupiter's moons in search of extra-terrestrial life. After the accidental death of a crew member, the crew must fight to finish their mission and reach Europa.

Europa Report is one of the most unique film experiences, and films, that exists. It's not a ""found footage"" subgenre sci-fi or a mockumentary, but a real fictional documentary. Yes, ""real"" fiction. The way the movie works is that it is edited, filmed and shaped as a documentary of the infamous journey of the Europa One, the first manned mission on the hunt for extra-terrestrial life in our own solar system. It works impossibly well. The acting, the visuals, the production, everything feels real and not like some staged performance act. The crew interactions are natural, the commentary of other scientists and snippets of news footage with computer-generated presentations add to the documentary filmmaking feel, and the camera angles from the ship itself showing the emptiness of space, bright blips of the Earth, Moon and the larger, illuminating Sun are haunting. Also, what makes Europa Report one of the greatest science fiction films in history is the fact it uses real science throughout, including the ramifications of finding cellular life on Europa, which is, eerily possible. Just ask yourself: what if extra-terrestrial life is alive and well beneath the icy surface of Europa? One of the crew members, portrayed by Sharlto Copley, is documented raising the big questions we would be asking and answering, like ""Where do we come from?"" or the more obvious one, ""Are we alone?""

I know there are more than a few people who don't care for sci-fi (which bewilders me, since it is the most inventive and creative genre), but regardless of what you like, Europa Report is an important movie, especially in our world today, and the coming future when something like a manned mission to Europa could happen. So, please, check this movie out. Just know, while still science fiction, it's a documentary, so don't expect much action, horror or anything fast-paced. There is absolute intensity, suspense and edge-of-your-seat thrills, but they're spread out to help fill in the gaps of the story, with what happened to the crew and what happened on Europa.",1374796800,4,2409,5.050251256281407

1198967,5,B000009S2E,"Since 2001: a Space Odyssey came out, the standard for a good ""hard science fiction film"" has been pretty high. Having grown up with the space program I often cringe at the stupid mistakes most films make.

I found this movie very entertaining and appreciated the amount of effort that went into making it look and feel authentic. A really good science fiction story can incorporate everything we know to be true and work it into the plot without having to come up with a bunch of fantasy technology to dumb it down for the masses. Things like artificial gravity, force fields, transporters, time travel are great when you want a fantasy, but then so are things like dragons, ghosts, magic, etc. The more you know about actual hazards faced with real space travel, the less you have to invent incredible plot devices to create danger. What I really liked about this story was that they used everything we know to be real about long-term space travel and made a good story within those boundaries.

Admittedly, I'm a nerd about this stuff. My dad worked on every space program from Apollo through Space Shuttle. My sister currently works on the ISS program. The kind of tech used in this movie isn't exotic, but the more you know, the more you'll really appreciate this film. But this movie doesn't have to be just for nerds. My girlfriend watched this with me and found it really enjoyable too. She's smart but I doubt she even knew what planet Europa orbited before watching this.

I'd suggest one tip while watching that will make the story easier to follow. The plot involves the spacecraft losing contact with mission control about halfway through the mission and what we see is a narrative put together from all the ship's logs as the ship finally reestablishes communication before the climax. Many of the events are told out of order and it's not obvious when the narrative jumps back and forth. Most shots are treated like video captured from hand held camcorders and closed-circuit cameras placed all over the spacecraft to record the mission, so there's a time-stamp that shows at what point into the mission that footage took place. Paying attention to the time-stamp clues you into where in the timeline that event happens.",1374192000,9,2235,4.7700258397932815

I think they could have shot it as a traditional film, similar to say ""moon"", and it would have been all the better for it.

My only complaint is, they still don't get the characters right.  There's no Chris Hadfield, or that woman behind the Seti project, or real science geeks--as someone above pointed out, they are a little behind the eight ball when it comes to identifying signgs of life given that they are there to find life.

1198980,2,B000009S2E,"Overall, the film goes for realism but doesn't do its homework.

1.) It's definitely not worth a 10$ rental.  I paid the nerd tax to see it early and it wasn't worth it at all.

2.) The editing really hurt the quality of this film.  The first half did a lot of jumping around which made following the film difficult.

3.) The characters were paper thin.  The only character that seemed to have the slightest depth was the engineer who has a son on earth.  There was little reason to care about the other characters.

4.) The plot was weak.  Like the crew, the plot is hard to care about.  It failed to set the mood and context of the film and tell a compelling story.  The most compelling element of the film is: are we alone in the universe (i.e. is there life on Europa)? It's glossed over in the beginning, but even that wasn't enough to carry the film.  As strong as such a discovery is, the film has to really make that theme, and why it's important, part of the film.  It didn't communicate that.

5.) I did like how the crew tries to explain everything away.  Not a good behavior, but typical of science/engineer types.

6.) The camera angles and  several shots are a little aggravating.  They are confined and obscured.  There was one particular shot where there is some kind of equipment right in front of the camera.  The shot was used several times and half the picture is occupied by this weird looking gizmo.

Minor gripes:  Why would the whole crew touch-down on Europa?  Who's going to operate the main ship with everyone on the surface?  The mission would have had to bring a bunch of fuel with them to launch the whole crew back into orbit off Europa.  It just seems like very bad mission planning.",1373846400,19,1715,4.402555910543131

1198987,3,B000009S2E,"First, I am giving this three stars because overall it is worth three stars. Parts of this movie were amazing, and parts of it really kind of sucked. Overall.... three stars.

The visuals are awesome! The set design is amazing. The ship and costumes are very well done. The zero-G effects are very well done, so much so I think some of the shots were done on that NASA Airplane (the vomit comet?). The overall story is interesting and reasonably well told.

But....(and this probably qualifies as a spoiler) the main problem I have is this the characters: This group of astronauts is sent to Europa to look for evidence of life. When confronted with evidence of Life they all stand around looking at each other thinking this is crazy because there can't possibly be life out here. I mean, its not like they came looking for life or anything.

If you like the 'found footage' method of story telling (Like Blair Witch but without the motion-sickness inducing visuals) then you will really enjoy this movie.

If you like a bit more Science in your Sci-Fi then you will probably enjoy this movie.

If you are looking for well told tale.... skip this one. The characters are a bit flat and predictable. And for supposedly super-smart rocket scientists and astronauts some of them do some really dumb stuff.",1373673600,4,1302,4.692982456140351
1198988,4,B000009S2E,An enormous amount of careful research and thought went into this movie.  It far surpasses movies with 10 times the budget.  I would have preferred toning down the flashbacks and having a somewhat more sequential telling of the story.  This is the only reason I stayed with 4 stars instead of 5.  Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.  It is easily among the top 20 sci-fi movies of all time.

1198992,4,B000009S2E,"By calling Europa Report a speculative documentary, I mean to put it in the same style category of Discovery Channel et. al. efforts like ""Supervolcano"" and ""Alien Contact.""  It invokes the feel of a National Geographic expedition documentary.

Overall, a great effort for a fairly low budget film. The bad science issues are minor - most notable are the rotating arm of the spaceship with no counter rotation of the rest of the ship (Newton's third law anyone?) and the apparently full Earth gravity on Europa.

The plot devices I consider flaws are unrealistic scenarios like: the problems encountered during the spacewalk, the lack of mission planning that threw such a huge wrench into the crew's plans after landing a mere 100 meters from their intended landing site, a lack of ANY redundant way to communicate with Mission Control, and a few questionable decisions by the crew. (I liken the extension of the surface walk to the classic 'space-explorer-takes-off-his-helmet-to-confirm-the-air-is-breathable' scene played out in SciFi movies from the 1950's right through ""Prometheus"").

Though the biggest 'suspension of disbelief' needs to be reserved for the possibility that we would send humans to Europa without first sending even a fraction of the robotic exploration we've sent to Mars.  I think the movie could have mentioned a few more advanced robotic missions as prelude to the manned mission to help with the authenticity of the premise.

While I agree with other reviewers that it's good to see a movie where scientists understand the importance of the data, I also applaud the movie for demonstrating the narrow-mindedness that scientists can show.  Whether this was intentional or not, the movie showcases the scientists refusing to believe something other than what their earth-developed theories suggest is causing the chaos on the planet.  Right up until the end of the movie, nobody is willing to step outside their own paradigm.  It reminds me of the X-Files - no matter how much weirdness Scully encountered, she still thought Mulder was nuts!

Overall, I enjoyed the movie enough to plan to purchase it when it comes out for sale.  This was a perfect movie to watch on Amazon 'Before It's in Theaters' because of the documentary style.  The movie is thoughtful and a bit thought-provoking and I'm grateful when such movies can cut through the summer blockbusters as well as this did.

P.S.  Don't let the disappointment of ""Apollo 18"" dissuade you from watching this movie.  Though billed with the similar 'found footage' advertising, this film is far superior.  Beyond that, ""Europa Report"" doesn't try to be a horror movie like the trailer slightly implies - though there are some tense scenes.",1373500800,214,2723,5.126696832579186

The hand-cam/ship-cam filming technique was reminiscent of The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield and is not my favorite style since it is so unstable but it does lend to the idea that these were real events.

The actual story though was a bit boring to watch.  It was difficult watching the obvious blunders committed by the crew members and there's very little character development done.  Only a small portion of the action is on Europa and the crew appears to be extremely inept at dealing with the challenges once they arrive. The interviews from the management board of the fictional Europa Ventures, LLC are not necessary:  they were good for establishing the reasons for going to Europa and maybe one more scene, but I feel they were overused.  Considering the budget, the effects are pretty good, but some stock footage has been used.

Europa was a bit slow at times and for the first 15-30min it jumps around in time so much without any context; your not 100% sure what's really going on.

When I actually played it I wasn't expecting a great deal. While the first third certainly could have lost 25 minutes with little impact on the viewer or story (there's a feeling it's been padded to get a feature-length movie), the final two thirds of the movie are absorbing and exciting.  It's once the team arrives at Europa that the movie really begins - then it delivers on both the science and the human-interest angles, building to a satisfying climax. The general balance of film-making elements in the film works, with set and costume design especially excellent. The special FX do the job in a convincing if not an overly spectacular manner.  The music is unobtrusive.  The actors are excellent, and their dialogue didn't creak.

1199024,5,B000009S2E,"Odds are, astronauts are selected because they don't go all Hollywood histrionics when they know they're going to die. Odds are, they accept missions with terrible odds because they believe in the science and advancing knowledge. Movie got that right.
Odds are, sexes can work together without this ridiculous sexual tension. Movie got that right. Nobody even hugged. I respect that.
Space travel is boring, the food sucks, you can't shower, you can't sleep, everybody smells funny. They got that right.
First movie I've seen in years that I didn't give up on in disgust because of the over the top histrionics.
This nerd here was most impressed. I watched it twice.",1372723200,7,666,4.955357142857143
1199025,4,B000009S2E,"I had heard that this movie was based on the book ""The Curse of Europa,"" which I read a few months back, but there are not many similarities.  Most books are better than their movie counterparts anyhow, but the characters and events were all different (except the same basic premise which is to search for life on Europa.)  So I don't know if it was based on it or not.  I'm guessing not.

I liked the realism of the movie but not really the ""found footage"" aspect. It doesn't really provide much character development and thus I never really cared much about what happened to them. I had heard so much about the ""science"" in this movie, but I thought it was a little bit of a let down.  What they had in there was awesome but I would have liked more.  The time line jumped around a bit which was confusing at times.  I really wanted to love this movie but I think it fell a little flat. I would like to say more about the first contact (which I was disappointed in) but I don't want to spoil anything.

The movie was decent and I liked it, I just didn't LOVE it.  If you like the premise, I would suggest checking out the Curse of Europa book.  The mission is the same but there is more (a lot more) action on and under the surface.  And there is true first contact in a cool way.  It is a bit more far fetched I suppose, but it was much more interesting.  It's not very long, if I remember right, and seemed to be geared to the Teen / YA market, but I liked it a lot.  I may actually re-read it now after seeing this movie.  Or maybe I'll check out ""Beneath"" or ""Frozen Sky"" which are also plotted behind Europa missions.",1372636800,,1623,4.140575079872204
1199026,5,B000009S2E,"Extremely taunt and engaging film....  I went into this movie thinking it might be okay, but was pleasantly shocked that it was in fact extremely well done.  SPFX, acting, script, storyline...all have the earmarks of a big budget film.  A great sci-fi story, well acted and edited.  My personal feeling is that Europa Report is a sci-fi thriller, not to be missed.",1372636800,2,364,4.82258064516129
1199027,3,B000009S2E,"I really wanted to like this video more. I had high hopes for it. It's a bit of ""Aliens"" meets ""2001/2010"" meets ""Blair Witch Project"". It was maybe a 3.5 at best (IMHO). There were several science/physics flaws (no spoilers here) that I let go b/c it was a relatively low budget film, but some of them could have been easily ""explained away"" with a few lines of dialog and no CGI special effects. The ending was a little too ""finite"" for my tastes, but still interesting. There was some good tension ramp ups with cerebral overtures and given the budget, there were some good effects. I am satisfied with this as a download purchase. I would have been a little disappointed if I had spent ""theater bucks"" on it.",1372636800,13,712,4.484615384615385
1199028,2,B000009S2E,"Average....very predictable.  Definitively not worth $10, and not sure why it is classified as a sci-fi horror. It's basically a"" lost footage"" reel from a exploration group that lost communications. Very similar to Mars  ""what if"" exploration type shows on  History or Discovery Channels.",1372636800,5,289,5.5227272727272725
1199029,5,B000009S2E,"I saw the trailers for this and have been waiting for it to become available On-Demand. I watched it last night and it is well worth the rental price. This is the kind of sci-fi that I really enjoy. The kind that has a sense of adventure into the unknown, realistic, and believable. This movie fit the bill perfectly. From the launch sequence, liftoff, through stage separation on through the long journey to Europa and the eventual landing on the surface of that icy Jovian moon. Even the EVAs were realistic. All of this was very well done and seems to pull the viewer into this amazing journey. The whole movie is done in a way as to depict the recovered video log of the entire mission which adds to its realism as well. Watch for the final few moments of the final scene. We get a very quick glimpse of what lives under the ice of Europa.

I think that this is the first time that I have seen a movie released first On-Demand and then the theaters. It is usually the other way around. That said, it is still worth seeing on a big screen of so desired.",1372550400,2,1056,4.28

7905712,5,B000009S2E,"In an age where we are bombarded with boring remake after remake I found this movie absolutely riveting. Though not quite an original concept, Europe Report, however, delivers a dose of epic wonderment for true fans of the hard SF genre. Leave the laser blaster and light saber at home as this movie explores scientifically on what discoveries might await us under the sea ice of this Galilean moon. This movie ranks right along with 2001: A Space Odyssey and Interstellar.",1525046400,,473,4.851851851851852

7905717,4,B000009S2E,"First although you can call this sci-fi, it is not an Aliens type movie or anything alike. I would describe it as a modern space travel sci-fi adventure. As the plot tells you, some time in the not so distant future, scientists have established likely life on the moon of Jupiter, Well life as in microbial, since there is signs of water under the deep ice etc. The mission is to travel to it obtain samples and return to earth. Of course there's is a twist when trying collect samples.....
The plays out much like a documentary style, but after a few mins it feels like a regular movie.
Its not an all action, explosions type movie, although it does have its moments of suspense. If you are a true sci-fi geek that enjoys watching the boring NASA channel every once in a while, then you will enjoy this one.
If your after Prometheus, Star Wars or Guardians of the Galaxy, you won't find it here.
The good stuff, the scenery, background, tech, ship all are very realistic to what you think we might be using in next 50 years, acting is top quality. I won't say any more as to not give spoilers, its a good true to life...enjoyable modern space travel flick.",1514419200,,1157,4.411214953271028

7905719,5,B000009S2E,"I watched this in a cinema and just streamed it again years later. While the storyline is disjointed this is, in fact, the point. it becomes more clear as the movie progresses.

Some of the dialogue seems stilted but that does reflect dialogue in real life. Just point a video camera at your aunt at christmas and see how long it takes for her to sound like this. The intent is to convey life aboard the ship among real people. Not everything is explained because not everything in life is explained. you get it from context or you do not, and move along.

the science and the imagery are about as solid as you can get. 2001 was great but everything was a bit too clean and managed. the more my mind lingers on europa Report the more I think they got it just right.",1512432000,2,765,4.268965517241379
