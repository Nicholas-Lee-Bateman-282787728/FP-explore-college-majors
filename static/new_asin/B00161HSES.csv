8260672,5,B00161HSES,"While the cinematic value for this production is not as high as either Zeffirelli's or Luhrmann's, it does very accurately depict the play.  Instead of cutting speeches and rearranging lines to fulfill the director's cinematic vision, it presents the play itself.  I have been teaching Romeo and Juliet for nearly 20 years, and I enjoy this production because the way it very clearly portrays what the text is communicating.  Added bonus is seeing Alan Rickman as Tybalt--great casting call there!",1455580800,2,497,5.1875
8260673,5,B00161HSES,"This video from what I have read is a pretty complete version of the text, about 3  hours long.  Sets and costumes are traditional Elizabethan.  Othellos costume is particularly unflattering to the actor in some regards and a little distractingenough said on that.  In terms of casting, Desdemona appears a wee bit taller than Othello, though she may not actually be.  She has a particular way with her mouth that reminds me a little of Carol Burnette, so I was a little distracted by that.  But as the play went, she played it all so well, and in her final scene before Othello returns, I really loved her here and throughout.  I believed her every bit to be a Desdemona. Hopkins interpretation instantly reminds me of Richard Burton, although I don't know if the latter ever played Othello.  Both are Welsh, and have similar ways of acting, both wonderful speaking voices. I am not tuned to the correct Shakespearean way to say the lines, so that was not a drawback, though I have read some mild criticism about it. What I was impressed with was that Hopkins brought a complexity of agony, subtlety, love, naivetyfelt like I got a very good look at the Othello character.  The interpretation of Iago I thought was great in its lack of over-acting the villain, but playing someone to be so cruel - not touched by the pain and agony of even Desdemona, while she puts her implicit trust in him. That he has no regard for the lives of either Roderigo or Cassio or Desdemona in carrying out his hate towards Othello.  I watched this in order to follow Verdi's Otello, the opera.  It was a great way to prepare for the opera, which I enjoyed immensely after having viewed the complete story through this presentation, but Othello is a difficult story to watch unfold - so cruel and you see it and you know how it will end.  I have only seen clips of the Olivier/Smith version, and was very impressed with that one also.",1446508800,,1915,4.551020408163265
8260674,3,B00161HSES,"Note: I saw this production via XFinity On Demand.

It's not a very good one, in my opinion, as Hopkins screamed a lot of his line when at times subtlety was called for, and Hoskins giggled a little too much, and the makeup job on Hopkins was obvious. Notwithstanding, the actors did a good job, and it is worth viewing to see Sir Anthony Hopkins playing a Shakespearean role before he became Hannibal Lecter. Not Rated.",1442793600,,420,4.526315789473684
8260675,5,B00161HSES,I used this production to offer excerpts of the play for my sophomore literature class. Even the production choices added to the class conversation.,1426982400,,148,5.208333333333333
8260676,5,B00161HSES,"This version, ""The Dramatic Works of William Shakespeare Tragedies (BBC): Othello"" (1981), is the one I grew up on. Each version or presentation has its strength and weakness. As so everyone will have a favorite version. This is my favorite version. I actually saw this first in a class in 1981. So this is the version by which I gage the others.

At first you are impressed at the list of actors that appear (Anthony Hopkins, Bob Hoskins, and others).  Then you are impressed with Anthony Hopkins (makeup and acting style).  Later you notice the great camera work that gives you the feel of the play and focuses in just the right place and time.  The set gives us the feel we are watching the play (not some epic movie).

The location is Venice. Othello and Desdemona are the perfect husband and wife.  They love and trust each other implicitly.  It seems that many other people especially men love Desdemona also.  However, his most trusted and ""honest"" friend decides to act on this by treachery and deceit to convince Othello of Desdemona's alleged unfaithfulness.  ""The best laid plans...""",1411603200,,1094,4.776595744680851
8260677,4,B00161HSES,"As a teacher who covers R&J each year, I wanted a version close to the actual text.  Overall, of those I've viewed, this one is the best in that regard.  From a students perspective, the acting is a bit dull in parts, the fight scenes are too staged and comical, and Romeo just looks too old.  Those are the main reasons not for a 5 star rating.  If you're a fan of Shakespeare, this is basically a 5 star version.",1387497600,2,414,4.1375
8260678,5,B00161HSES,"My granddaughter took a class in Shakespeare this year because it was the only English class she could fit into her schedule, and she loved it.  She knows more about Shakespeare then her parents, her aunts & uncles, and her grandfather (all college graduates) and can discuss it very intelligently.  I have since bought her a number of Shakespeare DVDs, which she has avidly watched.  I bought this because Anthony Andrews plays Mercutio and Alan Rickman plays Tybalt.  She loved it.  I hope to borrow it from her and see it myself, but I am basing this review on her reaction.  Andrews & Rickman are two long-time favorites of mine, so I look forward to seeing it.",1366675200,2,665,4.641025641025641
