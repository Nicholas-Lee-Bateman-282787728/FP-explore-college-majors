8529593,4,B008QOH1L8,"Midnight F.M. Was an entertaining thriller worthy of a viewing.

The film centers around a late night DJ whose about to take a break from her job to spend more time with her children. She's been extremely successful in her time slot, Midnight to 4:00 A.M. And she has a large fan base. But for her, family must come first. Of course most of the radio producers are not happy with her decision and her crew thinks the station will lose ratings once she's gone.

 In any case, the film soon turns into a nightmare for her when she discovers that a scisophrentic listener, who has followed her broadcast since the beginning, decides to dictate how she will run her last show...including making him  a part of it. He has a deep connection to her, all in his mind and he resorts to taking her kids and sister hostage, to get his demands met. The result is a turbulent ride of suspense, action and terror until the story reaches a conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

I liked this film overall and I think it presents the larger picture of how volatile a person of fame can be. In fact Sun -young, the DJ, has two fan stalkers to deal with in the film, although they come from different ends of the spectrum. In any case the whole idea of trying to continue on with a radio broadcast, while knowing your loved ones are in the clutches of a crazy stalker, was quite compelling. And the acting in the film is good all around. I definitely felt some of Sun's stress and frustration as she tried to deal with the situation.

But the film's not all a box of chocolates. There is a point where you have to suspend your sense of reality as the plot progresses. Some elements, if you think about them, could have easily been thrawted by authorities in real life. And it almost felt like the psycho had a little to much control over the goings on in a big city. Sure he had time to plan things out, but the film makes the police and the radio station appear as if they were mindless puppets that he easily manipulated.

In any case, if you can see past that small complaint, Midnight F.M. is still a very entertaining ride, especially if you like watching suspens/ thrillers.

Tech aspects include the film in Korean with English subtitles. No dub is available.

My final rating is a 4 for crafting a griping plot and giving us a turbulent ride. This is a great film if you like thrillers in general, or if you just like watching Korean cinema.",1438041600,,2431,4.37250554323725

8529597,2,B008QOH1L8,"I would first off like to state that I am a huge fan of films from South Korea. I've enjoyed A Bittersweet Life, A Tale of Two Sisters, JSA, Oldboy, Shiri, Lady Vengeance, I Saw the Devil, Sympathy for Mister Vengeance, I'm a Cyborg, The Host, Memories of Murder, Mother, Chaser, Thirst, The Good The Bad The Weird, and numerous others. However, I did not like this movie. The one five star review that was on here at the time of this writing made me think that it was going to be a truly great film. I was less than pleased. I believe I should point out any positive traits first and then move on to the negative. Yu Ji-tae is amazing. He's really intimidating in this film. If there is one reason to watch this film, it's for his performance. That's it.

Now on to the negative bits. There are two things about this film that every time I've watched it bother the crap out of me. I would like to state that I've watched it in full once and half way through on three separate occasions, I can't make it through again because of these problems. The first problem is cinematography. I understand that when you don't show something that it is more powerful. However, you must at least set up what it is you're not showing. There are certain points where something happens but they don't set it up and then they show what happened. An example of this is at the beginning when Ji-tae's character breaks into the house and hits a character with a hammer. This scene looks really weird because we know he's not near her head and he swings down and she passes out. There are other examples of this but I'm not going to waste the whole review picking them out. There are other shots throughout the movie that just look terrible and often have you wondering what's going on. It can be too dark at times as well.

The second problem is the female lead, she's a despicable person. You're supposed to be rooting for her to get her family back but I found myself rooting for Ji-tae's character instead and he was a creep. I understand that maybe she could have started off that way and slowly developed into a tolerable character but that didn't happen. She treats a lot of people like crap and I keep finding myself wanting terrible things to happen to her. It really pulled my interest out of the movie. I could probably deal with the crappy shots if she was at least a tolerable or even interesting character.

There are other stupid bits but those are the two that really stand out. I really wanted to like this film and still try to (which is why I've tried to go back to it). It's just disappointing.",1365033600,,2593,4.375518672199171
8529598,5,B008QOH1L8,"There have been a handful of South Korean thrillers that have earned a bit of hype over the past few years: ""The Chaser"" (2008) and ""I Saw the Devil"" (2010) being the two obvious choices, though ""Mother"" (2009) could also be considered if one classifies it as a dramatic thriller. I recently posted an IMDb user comment on ""No Mercy"" (2010), which I personally enjoyed more than the aforementioned films in terms of pure entertainment value. However, ""Midnight F.M."" (2010) has now ascended to my top spot.

Here's a reworded plot summary from AsianMediaWiki: Popular TV anchorwoman & late night radio host Sun-Young (Soo Ae: ""Sunny"" 2008, ""Once in a Summer"" 2006) prepares to work her final radio program, after which she will prepare to take her daughter to America the following morning. During the radio show Sun-Young receives a startling text message from a man named Dong-Su (Yoo Ji-Tae: ""Oldboy"" 2003, ""One Fine Spring Day"" 2001), who has broken into her apartment and taken hostages. Dong-Su then sends the text message to Sun-Young instructing her to follow his directions and not to tell anyone.

Oh man, this is non-stop suspense from start to finish, with efficiently constructed tension and very good performances by everyone. The conventional premise is outshined by its sheer execution and avoidance of any and all dull filler material. At first the protagonist is forced to retrieve specific information from her previous shows and duplicate those moments on the air, but the storyline branches out in a variety of ways and eventually introduces themes of vigilantism and media responsibility. Soo Ae gives an inspired, energetic performance. This thriller is extremely exciting and a lot of fun to watch, relying more on pure suspense instead of graphic violence. A must see for everyone.",1346198400,7,1806,5.097972972972973
