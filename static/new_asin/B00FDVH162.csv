5978341,5,B00FDVH162,This TV series was one of my wife and my favorites when it was on TV so many years ago. It is great to have the complete series now to watch without commercials and in the order they were created. The complete set was very reasonable considering you receive 21 DVD'S. I recommend it to any of you who miss the type of programs that made up earlier TV.,1416787200,16,351,4.101449275362318
8614531,4,B00FDVH162,"Technical details- This is a really nice looking boxed set of the classic mystery movie series, McMillan and Wife. The video quality varies a bit due to the vagaries of old footage, and the music loop on our season two disk in the menu was stuck, but there were no problems in playback of the shows themselves. I was a bit disappointed that the ""bonus disk"" was just two movies already included on their respective season disk; perhaps these are a different cut of the movies, but I have not watched the bonus disk so I can't confirm one way or the other. Show details- If you are unfamiliar with McMillan and Wife, it's actually a fun show to watch. The chemistry between Hudson and St. James is what really sells it, at least in the early seasons. I first found it back in the 90's in reruns, and this is my second re-watching of the series since then. Unlike some older shows, this one is less prone to cringe-worthy moments due to changing cultural standards than a show titled ""McMillan and Wife"" might suggest, though there are a few of those cringers sprinkled through. The thing that has impeded my enjoyment of the show most in this re-watching is that ironically, having the seasons available in order for sequential viewing exposes the myriad plot continuity errors and odd writing choices that plague the series. Perhaps the best example of this is the mystery Mac never solves- The Great Disappearing Baby. Sally is suddenly pregnant for one episode at the end of season one- though I read in an interview with one of the writers that this was briefly touched on in the first episode of the second season, it must have been so brief I missed it, because that pregnancy is never mentioned again. Throughout season four, she is pregnant again, and it is a big part of the ongoing season four plot- however, past a couple of vague mentions of the baby offscreen in the first episode of season five, we never see the McMillan baby again. Not only is this vexingly illogical, it really undermines the characters of Mac and Sally. They are supposed to be a very in-love, happily married couple. They are both made out to be caring and loyal. Then all the sudden, they have a baby and never mention it again? You just feel weird about them as characters watching the rest of the episodes. In general, they begin to lose their way with the Mac and Sally relationship in later episodes, as Sally sees less screen time and they toss in some uncomfortably flirtatious banter between Mac and other women. And of course, the last season should be avoided in it's entirety, as the ""death"" of Sally is handled abysmally, and Mac's character becomes almost wholly unlikable as he flits from love interest to love interest. I actually recommend watching the episodes from seasons 1-5 out of order, so you don't really expect continuity, and the plot issues become less jarring.",1532044800,,2873,4.6463654223968565
8614532,5,B00FDVH162,What a time capsule this set is! I grew up watching this show as an NBC Movie of the week way back in the day. Rewatching it now after all these years is quite enjoyable. The clothing styles alone makes watching this series a hoot! Rock and Susan St. James really have chemistry in this series. If you love vintage television as its best (at the time) then by all means get this box set and enjoy!,1524614400,,397,4.1688311688311686

8614536,1,B00FDVH162,"Like the series but has a great many problems with the disc.  Skips, locks and freezes.  Whoever creates those discs should look at the ""quality control"" part of their operation.  AMAZON, if it wants to keep selling these ""complete series"" products, should make sure that the recording quality is there as well.  There are other ""complete series"" I would like to purchase but, based upon my experience with this set, I don't believe I will.",1456531200,8,440,4.826666666666667
