8245303,5,B0012DT21W,This was a very interesting view into life in South East Asia.  It covered many countries in that region.  The video quality was amazing.,1454198400,,137,4.666666666666667
8245304,2,B0012DT21W,"This DVD is made up of little more than a rapidly-changing slide show of adequate-quality photographs. In many places, however, the narration is completely out of sync with the pictures on your screen, sometimes ludicrously so. Even more frustrating, the narrator will frequently throw out a one-sentence remark which introduces what is undoubtedly an interesting, complex, revealing topic - cultural, political, social, historical - but will offer no elaboration or explanation whatsoever. Putting it all together, this DVD offers far too little to anyone who truly wants to learn something about Southeast Asia. I cannot recommend this disappointing video.",1365033600,3,658,5.656565656565657
