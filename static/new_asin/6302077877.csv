422225,4,6302077877,Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds team up again after their success in Singing in the Rain to offer a wonderful comedy with great dance numbers by O'Connor and wonderful spoofs on Astaire and Kelly.  A little known but highly entertaining 50's musical. Watch it and be prepared to smile and tap your toes.,997142400,4,307,4.7924528301886795
422226,4,6302077877,"Probably the best routine is ""A Lady Loves"" and takes place  before any of the movie's action, but that doesn't detract from the rest of  the film. Lighthearted and endearing, ""I Love Melvin"" showcases  the talents of two of MGM's talented 'song and dance men', as well as a  number of well loved character actors of the era. A great pick-me-up.",968889600,3,345,4.60655737704918
422227,4,6302077877,"Why on earth is ""I Love Melvin"" so ignored by film buffs?  Even people who can lip-synch to every Arthur Freed musical ever made generally don't know this one, and it's a shame.  It was the movie that put Debbie  Reynolds over the top; her work before this one (even in ""Singin' In  The Rain"") was essentially as a supporting player.  In ""I Love  Melvin"" you can actually SEE Debbie becoming a full-fledged star; it  happens as soon as the movie starts, in a number called ""A Lady  Loves"".  Debbie bursts onto the screen in thousands of dollars' worth  of high Helen Rose drag with a bevy of chorus boys, and proceeds to show  everyone she didn't need Gene Kelly holding her hand any more.  She's also  a delight clowning in ""Where Did You Learn to Dance?"" with Donald  O'Connor; Debbie dances as well as anyone ever did onscreen while refusing  to take herself seriously for a moment.  O'Connor's fine, too, offering up  several terrific dances of his own, one of them on roller skates.  As  Debbie's little sister, Noreen Corcoran is one of the best things in the  movie; she is that rarity, a child star who knew the value of putting a  little spice with the sugar audiences expect.  She's cute, droll, wistful  and astringent by turns- almost a pint-sized Marjorie Main- and by the end  of the movie, you find yourself wishing she'd had much more of a career.  If you like musicals, you could do a lot worse than to buy ""I Love  Melvin"".  Let everyone else worship the more famous M-G-M musicals;  this neglected film is a little gem!",953942400,41,1538,4.514598540145985
422228,4,6302077877,"""I Love Melvin"" reunites Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor (from ""Singin' In The Rain"").  It is a charming musical.  Both Debbie and Donald give wonderful performances.  The songs in this movie are  wonderful.  I especially love ""Where Did You Learn to Dance?"" and  ""A Lady Loves"".

422330,4,6302077877,"The plot is a simple, sappy story's: awkward, clumsy boy meets beautiful, graceful girl.  Father disapproves wanting girl to marry wealthy, debonair man.  Guy makes a mess of it.  But, in the end, true love triumphs and guy wins girl despite himself.

You don't buy this film for the ploy

By the way, it takes an enormous amount of skill and polish to play awkward and clumsy.

You buy this film for the dancing... and specifically for Donald O'Connor dancing... and especially for the Life's Little Ups and Downs scene wherein O'Connor tap dances on roller skates.

As you watch this, look for one thing:  camera cuts.  A camera cut is an opportunity for the director to change perspective.... but it is also a way for an editor to splice together footage from one take with that from another.  In the Life's Little Ups and Downs dance, the camera pans and zooms to follow O'Connor, but they're are only four cuts, and none during the tap-dance sequence.  O'Connor did that.  No editing.  No CGI.  No computer animation.  No special effects.  He just did it in one take. It is amazing dance.  And that is why you buy this film.",1472169600,4,1129,4.592964824120603

Melvin lies to cover his tracks and tells her he's landed her on the cover, but of course, that isn't true!

It's a simple story used mainly to pad the plentiful musical numbers and the many costumes Debbie has to flaunt. It's very similar to Funny Face, but it's nothing special. Just an enjoyable but hardly memorable way to spend 77 minutes.",1304899200,3,625,4.63063063063063
422437,4,6302077877,"""I Love Melvin""  is a very good MGM musical that is often overshadowed by classics such as ""The Band Wagon,"" ""Easter Parade,"" and ""Meet Me in St. Louis.""

Made right after ""Singin' in the Rain,"" it reunited Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor and was, in fact, Reynolds' first starring role.  She plays Judy LeRoy, a Broadway chorus girl.  He is Melvin Hoover, a Look magazine photographer.

Melvin convinces Judy he can send her star aloft by putting her on the cover of Look.  Now he has to make it happen.  The plot is routine, but the musical numbers are great, from ""A Lady Loves,"" with Reynolds and a male chorus performing in a dream sequence, to O'Connor's solo, ""I Wanna Wander,"" and the spirited duet, ""Where Did You Learn to Dance?""  There's even a number in which O'Connor dances on roller skates, a feat Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly accomplished in bigger films before and after ""I Love Melvin.""

But when the movie came I put it in my TV and it didn't work. It said it could not read the disc. I tried it in a my computer too. Same thing. Soooo...I sent it back and bought the same item, thinking the disc I had bought had just been defective. Well, same story over again. Then you have to go through the hassel of returning it and getting a refund. Trust me, this movie is a definate no-no.",1299456000,,524,4.048076923076923
422497,4,6302077877,"Right from the opening credits when Debbie Reynolds scrawls the movie title on her mirror with her lipstick, there's this lively, energetic vibe onscreen.  I LOVE MELVIN came out in 1953 and it reunites Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds one year after SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, and this time O'Connor plays the romantic lead. This time, Cosmo gets the girl. O'Connor may not be as dashing as Gene Kelly, but I think he's more unassuming and more likable. Gene Kelly always had this smugness about him. I LOVE MELVIN is a fun little movie but, in an era of fabulous musical films, it doesn't hold classic status. The roster of not quite A-listers has something to do with it, as does the mediocrity of the songs. Maybe O'Connor aping Kelly's iconic pose on the lamppost from SINGIN' IN THE RAIN has something to do with it. This gesture might have been a homage, but it sort of smacks of wannabe.

It's not new, the plot. It's about another aspiring performer trying to catch that big break. In this one, lowly, klutzy photographer's assistant Melvin Hoover falls in love with young Broadway actress Judy LeRoy. Trying to impress Judy, Melvin promises to put her on the cover of Look magazine. This, of course, backfires.

Pair up Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds and the movie can't help but be bright and breezy, and these two are the primary reasons to check out I LOVE MELVIN. This was still before Reynolds got glammy and sort of annoying. At this stage, she was still this bubbly, unaffected, wholesome girl next door, and she is marvelous to watch. Donald O'Connor is a talented performer, and his fans all know that he should've been a bigger star. But he never had those leading man looks and that probably hampered his career. I mean, they paired him up with a talking mule, for cripes' sake, and I'm not sure that the mule wasn't better looking.

The songs aren't bad, just not memorable. It starts with a dream sequence as a glitzy gowned Reynolds sings ""A Lady Loves"" and does her best ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"" routine. But the two musical numbers which stick to my brain most are the clever football ballet number - in which Debbie gets cheerfully tossed around dressed up as the football - and ""Where Did You Learn to Dance?"" in which O'Connor and Reynolds are simply terrific as they cut a rug. O'Connor once more demonstrates his impressive physicality while on roller skates as well as in ""I Wanna Wander."" Unfortunately, ""I Wanna Wander"" didn't work for me. I can't help but feel that it's trying too hard to be another ""Make 'Em Laugh."" But I liked it that the nine-year-old girl gets to sing her own song.

The script does come up with some funny bits, but what cracks me up the most, for some reason, is the little girl fingering Richard Anderson's character to the police. And while the leads may not be top box office draws, the supporting cast has got their backs. If you watch classic films then you've seen Una Merkel before. Here, she plays Debbie's mom. Allyn Joslyn has several entertainingly grouchy scenes as Debbie's irascible dad, and here's a party drinking game: take a drink each time Joslyn mentions how much his boss hates him. Richard Anderson plays the handsome but blah Harry Flack, Judy's other suitor, and I get a kick out of his lame punchlines ( ""I know - I just stepped in a poodle.""). But Jim Backus trumps the rest of the supporting cast as O'Connor's very cranky boss. Check out the facial expressions the guy comes up with. Oh, and Robert Taylor (at the time a big, big movie star) steps in for a quick cameo in one of Debbie's dreams.

Sure, MGM has produced bigger, glossier musicals. I totally get how I LOVE MELVIN has gotten overlooked. But I'm saying, if you get a chance to catch this fun little musical, then you're in for a good time. It's worth it alone, really, just to see Debbie Reynolds maintain great humor in the bits when ""She's a football on Broadway.""",1273449600,6,3931,4.592592592592593
