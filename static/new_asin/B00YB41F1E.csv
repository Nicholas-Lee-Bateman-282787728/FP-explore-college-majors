In terms of acquiring knowledge of our complex new technology, I can not think of a better example that demonstrates this adage than James Bendewald's instructional DVD "" Phantom Knowledge"" for the DJI Phantom.

Documentation and user manuals are obviously important, but they can be very frustrating. Those who write them are ALREADY well familiar with the product and at times lack the perspective of a newbie who may need more to assimilate the material. Frankly, even after having read the user manual for several weeks, the thought of sending this $1,400 phantom to the skies Gave me the jitters.

The "" Phantom Knowledge"" DVD gave me a visual perception of how to handle the basic and important aspects of flying the drone. James' instructional narrations are well presented, comprehensive and easy to understand.

I played the DVD on my large TV screen, with all the Phantom equipment on a table in front of me. My ""Fear of Flying"" was soon replaced by an eagerness to go out there and do it. I have since then flown my Phantom successfully numerous times, and received high praise on the resulting videos.

I figure that if studying the "" Phantom Knowledge"" DVD prevented even a minor ""beginner's crash"" of my Phantom, then I got my money's worth.",1436486400,,1292,4.806306306306307
