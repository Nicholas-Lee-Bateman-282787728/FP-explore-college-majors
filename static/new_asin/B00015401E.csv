8006588,1,B00015401E,"I reviewed this after I first bought it last Christmas.  At the time I was disappointed but have since changed my mind and feel that in all fairness I should post an updated review.

""Wonders of Nature in Our Backyard,"" takes a look at the animals, insects and flowers in Jerry Turner's backyard.  The first section focuses on birds, then butterflies and bugs, there's a section of flower shots, and a spot with frogs.  Accompanying each section is background music.  There is no voice over.

From what I could see none of the wildlife featured is particularly rare or unusual.  However, in a way that is one of the video's charms.  It's nice to really see what is all around us but generally hidden from view.

The photography is excellent and music is always pleasant.  There is a section with a passalid beetle that is quite amusing and always makes my son laugh out loud.  The frogs are particularly vivid and interesting.

My five year old son puts this in the DVD player on nearly a daily basis and sits quietly through the duration of it.  The only downside is the fact that you have to wait until the end of the video to see the names of everything that is shown.  (Also, they forgot to list the name of the last little frog.)

Be advised that the video is only 38 minutes in length.  While it is not very long, it is appropriate for the subject matter.

This DVD was released in 2003, the first part of a series that will follow each season.  I am eager to purchase the next one! If I could change the stars I would give it 4 out of 5.",1104451200,2,1544,4.320557491289199
8006589,5,B00015401E,"Viewing the animals, flowers and plants during the change from winter into fall in Jerry's backyard is simply captivating.  My children and I have viewed this film and the questions and comments from them flow endlessly. Their favorite part is when the music is silent and the natural sound of frogs fills our living room.  My favorite part is ""Stars of the Show"" where each creature in the film is identified.  I can see how an immobilized child or adult would enjoy seeing the shots Jerry has captured on this unique DVD.",1073347200,,523,4.663043478260869
8006590,5,B00015401E,Jerry Turner shows his appreciation for our natural world in a way that few people have ever seen.  We own both of his videos and enjoy watching them with our children.  A great investment!,1071360000,2,189,4.529411764705882
