1357284,4,B00004UGAY,"""We were robbed, he got the brown bag. Yes, that brown bag."" Jimbo is a young father who has a gambling problem. When he gets in deep to a local mob boss he has one choice. Pay him back or give him his son. With his back against the wall he decides to rob a fish market, but for a non-criminal things don't always go right. This first and foremost is a really funny comedy. Just seeing the events unfold on its own is really funny and entertaining to watch but when mixed with the dialog it makes it that much more fun to watch. This movie combines the best of British crime movies with American comedy. While this movie won't win any awards it is one of the most entertaining movies that I have seen in a while and I recommend this. The type of movie you can just put in and not really have to think about, just watch and enjoy. I liked it. Overall, very entertaining and very much worth seeing. I give it a B+.",1364169600,7,912,4.100558659217877
1357285,3,B00004UGAY,"This was a decent title all-around.  The robot combat is nothing spectacular but is not bad.  There's some strong language in this video.  The voice-acting is not exactly top-notch.  The girls are kind of ditsy, but it's done for laughs and is fairly funny.  The villain is as despicable as any I've seen in anime so far.  He's very brutal to women, but actually has a semi-logical reason for the things he does (though that's not revealed until a later volume).  The most noteworthy aspect of this video is the nudity.  The women get naked quite a bit, and it's up to you to decide whether this is for you.  Personally, I loved it.  There's also some lesbian innuendo.  Overall I've seen much better movies, but if you're looking for a decent sci-fi anime with a lot of naked women, this is a good pick.",971395200,2,804,4.475862068965517

1357307,2,B00004UGAY,"I really like Brendan Fraser but he actually has not much screen time in this movie.  Colm Meany is another actor I like but i just couldn't get into his character at all.  It just didn't get my attention. I got bored 20 minutes in, but kept hoping it would get better.  I ended up just feeling like I had wasted an hour and a half.  It's not worth watching a second time.",1410652800,,372,4.054794520547945
1357308,5,B00004UGAY,"Stand off with Brendan Frazer is a hit! It's a wonderful little gem of a movie that included Colm Meaney as the detective and David O'hara as the mob king. Everything that can possibly go wrong, does!  But, it makes for a really good comedy. Brendan Frazer is such an under rated actor and always brings such honesty to the roles he is playing (plus he is super sexy, as well, without even trying). It had me from the start. It is definitely worth watching this awesome movie and I will encourage friends and family to watch!",1409270400,,525,4.412371134020619
1357309,4,B00004UGAY,"Brendan Fraser was cute in this film.  He played the part well.  I do not know why they felt it necessary to make the leading lady African, it was about Ireland and Irish-American characters.",1400198400,,191,4.588235294117647
1357310,4,B00004UGAY,"While not my favorite Brendan Fraser movie, Stand Off was still worth watching at least once.  Brendan delivers a great performance, but the script he had to work with could have been a bit better.",1396915200,2,197,4.628571428571429

1357314,1,B00004UGAY,Very disappointed in this movie... I guess Brandon is just taking movies cause he is out of work... This is not the type of movie he usually does and it was hard watching it the whole way through!! Please save your money and don't bother purchasing this film,1372291200,,258,4.395833333333333
1357315,4,B00004UGAY,I'm a Brendan Fraser fan so I had to see this movie (even though I had never heard of it before).  I thought it was going to be more of a thriller but it was more comedic.  It was surprisingly good with a few unexpected twists.,1371168000,,227,3.9130434782608696
1357316,1,B00004UGAY,"Ouch! Watching the absolutly retarded behavior of the characters - particularily the son - made you wish someone would beat him to death just on principle.  The plot was bad, but the execution was horrible.  With so many talented actors, I was expecting better.",1369785600,,261,4.909090909090909
1357317,4,B00004UGAY,"Any fan of Brendan Fraser and Colm Meaney will definitely want to see this one.  It is watchable by most the family.  Fraser plays a man that tries to escape his wife and her mafia family in New York by going to Ireland.  There he runs his Uncles Antique shop while he's away. Meaney plays the officer in charge at the hostage negotiations.

Spoiler:  He gets caught up in the escape of a fish market robber in the shop, and to make matters worse the bag he took is wanted by the Irish mafia.  Then what he would never expect is to meet his son and grandson while he is there.  This is a fun movie and not at all what I expected.

Some occasional funny parts, some swearing, thick accents. Brandan appears on the front but he is not the main chracter, likeable none-the-less. Also, an odd character twist that not even Brandon is sure about.",1366588800,4,979,6.458015267175573
1357320,4,B00004UGAY,"STAND OFF is a surprisingly engaging dramedy from Irish director Terry George.  The script involves a young American relocated to Belfast to manage his cousin's curio shop; a young gambler indebted to a ruthless loan shark; a dedicated lawman with a son trying to follow in his dad's footsteps, and an odd assortment of village locals.
It's all presented with lots of comical coincidences and physical humor.  The cast led by Brendan Fraser and Colm Meany is excellent and the movie is really quite entertaining.  I recommend STAND OFF for anyone seeking something a little different.",1366416000,3,584,5.0625
1357321,4,B00004UGAY,"This is a combination crime-drama comedy which is light on both, but entertaining just the same. Joe Maguire (Brendan Fraser) is watching a shop for his cousin in Ireland. Due to a number of odd circumstances Joe becomes the hostage of a young desperate man (Martin McCann) who recently robbed a crime boss (David O'Hara). As they are held up in the shop, Detective Weller (Colm Meaney) is outside negotiating.

Fraser and Meany provide the proper light comedic element to this film filled with quirky characters from our stars down to the gypsy Travellers. Meany is the old fashion home spun detective, our Andy of Mayberry. He tries to keep the situation real and low key while there are other departments who make this out to be something which requires major intervention.

The film also includes father/son relationships, Joe's love interest, and of course the Irish mafia. This feature is definitely worth a view. It would make for a good date night film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1366070400,3,1004,4.894117647058824

If you like British farcical shows, you'll enjoy this
I found it a bit disjointed and over-the-top
Poor subtitling didn't help - while it distracted, it gave new unintended meaning to things.",1364947200,4,214,4.972222222222222
1357323,5,B00004UGAY,"Very funny movie.  It is set in Belfast Ireland and the cast is mostly Irish and British, other than Brendan and YaYa.  Fast paced with lots of action and humor.  I am a fan of Brendan Fraser from the Mummy movies.  Colm Meaney provides a strong perfomance as well.  The film is directed by academy award winning director Terry George.",1364515200,4,335,4.516666666666667

1357325,5,B00004UGAY,"This movie was alot of fun to watch, and very enjoyable. It starts off a bit slow as you are introduced to the various characters, However, after that it really takes off, and the longer you watch, the better it gets. The actors were all very very good and the plot was great. The interaction between the actors makes for rich humor with out being stupid, and you never know what will happen next. So, you have humor, action, budding romance, hitmen, mob bosses, crime, upset mothers, and all kinds of wonderfull characters to enjoy. Filmed in Northern Irland, so sometimes the accents are a bit hard to understand, but not often. This movie can be viewed by the whole family. No F-bombs, no nudity, no sexual situations, and what violence there is was done with taste and consideration. If you decide to see this movie, I'll bet you will not be dissatisfied.

7924029,5,B00004UGAY,"Offbeat, totally stoned and quirky fun. Micky Dolenz is marvelous! It is a trip back in time, not perfect but neither were those days in history. Watch it for Micky's performance primarily.",1503446400,,189,4.9375
7924030,5,B00004UGAY,"I am honored to have been part of the commentary track on this DVD along with the rest of the 'Zilch - A Monkees Podcast' crew. Ken Mills, Melanie Mitchell, Sara Clark, Craig Cohen and I had a great time discussing the movie as we watched it together and we are all especially grateful to producer Iain Lee for giving us the opportunity. We hope you all enjoy listening along :)

As a Monkees fan for most of my life I was anxious to see this film. As the previous reviewer said, Micky Dolenz does play quite a different role than we Monkees viewers are used to, but that's not to say there aren't shades of the zany Micky to be found here and there. Especially in the opening sequence. Often crossing back and forth between drama and comedy, the movie is a strange and interesting take on hippie culture, its relationship with the establishment and how easily the lines between the two can blur given the right circumstances. There are a lot of laughs along the way as well as plenty of head-scratching moments that'll leave you wondering.. but all in all, a wonderful time capsule.",1485820800,4,1083,4.49746192893401
7924031,4,B00004UGAY,"A sweet fable disguised as a stoner film--there actually is almost no drug use in the entire movie!  The title refers both to Micky's character's eager attempt to grow a baby pot plant in a tiny patch of earth, and to the hippies' efforts to establish a viable community of their own in a dilapidated,  abandoned town.  Issues of ownership, boundaries, and economic imperatives are given a brightly humorous wink.  See Micky Dolenz play against type as a sweet, innocent man-child trying to convince a woman--any woman--to give him his first sexual experience.  Also watch out for a young and stunningly handsome Gerald McRaney as a strait-laced law student trying to join the hippy community; once you throw away your shoes, there's no going back!

Iain Lee has been very frank about the physical condition of the restored film; it is not perfect.  But it is certainly watchable, and the sound is just fine.  If you love Dolenz and/or McRaney, and want to see them young and playing a different sort of role than you're used to seeing, this is well worth a try!",1480809600,11,1062,4.733695652173913

7924033,5,B00004UGAY,"This film is called ""Whole Lotta Sole"" in Ireland ( where it was made) and the UK; it's a little gem that tells it's tale and life's lessons with loads of charm and humor.  Perhaps promoters in the US thought they'd sell it better here as some kind of tough, violent gangster movie?  Yes, some of the characters are or are related to gangsters but that's so much beside the point!  This movie is deserving of far better ~ Though it doesn't have the same touch of the fae,it belongs more with films like ""Into the West""and ""The Secret of Roan Inish"" and even some of the intent of ""Snatch"".",1456012800,3,589,4.336363636363636

7924035,5,B00004UGAY,"Watched this because of David O'hara.  Wasn't expecting much, but I was surprised.  Bit slow in the beginning but then the plot began some twists and turns.  The main characters wind up in a hostage situation, which on the surface doesn't sound funny at all, but sets up in this film as hilarious.  Those who found it boring must be looking for more ""action"" type movies.  This has ""characters"" rather than action.  Takes place in Belfast many years past ""The Troubles"" but event that is part of the plot.  Really funny charming film from Northern Ireland.  I plan on viewing more, and hope this part of the world produces more films like this.",1445817600,,644,4.6371681415929205
