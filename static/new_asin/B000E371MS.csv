8104680,5,B000E371MS,"I love history and love Modern Marvels even more. This particular DVD was hard to find, but definitely worth it once I was able to purchase it. This DVD gives a good historical view of West Point and how it fits into today's ever changing landscape. I recommend this seller as my video came at the right time.",1403568000,,309,4.344827586206897
