8480809,5,B005NWS27I,"This is a military history treasure.  It tells the story of the U.S.S. Franklin CV-13, a WWII carrier, hit by two 500 lb. bombs.  It was one of the heaviest damaged ships to remain afloat after battle damage.  The crew saved the ship and became the most decorated U.S. Navy crew in WWII.  This program was a documentary production of a Norfolk, Va. TV station.  The ship had been towed to Norfolk for scrapping and the producers invited survivors (including the Captain, other key officers, and enlisted men) to tell their stories.  Brilliant testimony aboard the ship (it had been repaired and had been in mothballs until this trip to the scrappers in 1967) evokes strong emotions utilizing actual combat film of the ship exploding and burning for several hours.  These heroic survivors retrace their actual pathways of action on the silenced, inactive ship.  I have a direct link to this story.  I was stationed aboard a destroyer (DD-712) at a nearby pier and identified the Franklin by her stern nameplate as we moved past on a trip out to sea.  Hundreds lost their lives in the attack by a Japanese suicide plane.",1426636800,,1118,4.746113989637306
