2839125,5,B000QQDEZG,"There are specific wonderful, magical moments in most young boys' lives when they realize that they have an attraction to the opposite sex.  Such was the case when hottie JoAnna Cameron donned her ancient Egyptian amulet and chanted toward the sky ""Oh zephyr winds which blow high, lift me now so I can fly,"" and I was awakened to such childhood wonders!  Isis was a generational inspiration in the pantheon of heroic 70's television babes that included Linda Carter's Wonder Woman, Lindsay Wagner as the Bionic Woman, Charlie's Angels and Erin Gray's Wilma from Buck Rogers.

As science teacher Andrea Thomas, she had found the ancient amulet of Hatshepsut during an archeological dig which endowed upon her the powers of the ancient Egyptian goddess with the gifts of flight, speed, strength and telekinesis which were summoned when she intoned the sacred chants and using her powers selflessly to help those in need.  Her secret identity was concealed even from her closest friends Rick Mason, Renee Carol and Cindy Lee, but known only to her faithful feathered companion, a black crow named Tut.

The Secrets of Isis began as part of the Shazam!/Isis hour on CBS in 1975 consisting of 15 episodes and spun-off into her own series the following year but lasted only 7 episodes.  Isis would also crossover and appear in 3 episodes of Shazam! and later she appeared in animation form as a character of the Freedom Force on Tarzan and the Super 7.

""Oh my queen!"" said the royal sorcerer to Hatshepsit, with this amulet you and your decendants are endowed by the goddess Isis, with the powers of the animals and elements.  You will soar as the falcon soars, run with the speed of the gazelles and command the elements of sky and earth!""

3000 years later, a young science teacher dug up this lost treasure and found she was heir to... the secrets of Isis!

And so, unknown to even her closest friends, Rick Mason and Cindy Lee, she became a dual person - Andrea Thomas, teacher...

""Oh Mighty Isis!""

But after realizing that I purchased ALL of the episodes, I was more than pleased.  I was elated.  The Secrets of Isis (along with Shazam) is a gem from the Filmation people when Saturday morning television was both live action and cartoons.  Isis had actual stories, great special effects (for the day) and wonderful production values.  Some of the episodes crossed with Shazam - Captain Marvel (with John Davey) and they were very enjoyable.  Like The Adventures of Superman which has been a fan favorite since 1951, Secrets of Isis continues to be the role model for young women and a wet dream for young boys.  Every Baby Boomer will be very happy with owning this series in either format -- Video on Demand OR the actual DVD.  I would heartily recommend this series.  5 Stars!!!",1366243200,2,940,4.614457831325301

2839157,3,B000QQDEZG,"Wonder Woman she is not, but this was entertaining to watch to see what was hot in the 70s (fashion, slang, etc.).  There were too many questions unanswered: why does the incantation work, how did she find out the words, what is with the necklace, why those powers, etc.  Not too sophisticated.  The acting is okay.  The plots are okay.  The lessons give it a wholesome feel.  There's a theme of being kind throughout the 70s, and this is probably the first show that I've seen with other ethnicities being embraced and not denigrated.  This show smacks of woman's lib, so it's a glimpse of history for the decade.  Three stars overall.  I enjoyed going back in time, as I wasn't there to see it.",1357603200,4,696,4.504
2839158,5,B000QQDEZG,I bought this collection based on the fact I always wanted this show on dvd. I am a fan of Wonder Woman and the ISIS tv show. I like and still do care for DC characters like this. Maybe DC Comics will find a use for this character and return her as a superhero to the comics like they did with the series a few years ago.

2839162,5,B000QQDEZG,"This really is a great show taken in context.
Yes, the acting can be a bit wooden.  That isn't the end of the world, the only one in the first few Harry Potter movies who could act was the Snape character - people still loved them - myself included.
Yes, it is low budget, and awkwardly filmed.  You just have to remember that is is from the mid 1970s and it was aimed at the kids watching Saturday morning cartoons.
The stories are a little simplistic, and the music score may have been stolen from the local mall muzak, but somehow it all just works together.
This may be a bit bad, but it is sooo bad its good.
JoAnna Cameron plays the young science teacher who digs up the artifact that allows her to channel Isis, and save the day for teens in almost, semi-danger, and you can often count the cast members on just your fingers...
It is so much better than it sounds.
Okay, maybe the first disc features more ankle injuries than plot points, but the my girlfriend and I laughed so hard at this, there were tears in our eyes.
And fellas, JoAnna Cameron in the Isis outfit, it still hot by today's standards.  For an almost 40 year old kids show, that says something.",1327795200,,1169,4.304545454545455

My best friend and I would spend hours playing Isis and we couldn't wait for the next week's installment. In fact it is the show that first introduced me to History and set me on the path to what my real life job is today. It showed little girls that they could be anything they wanted and at the time it was a pretty bold statement to make.

Over the years I had forgotten about the show until I saw it for sale on DVD a couple of years ago. It's now on my list of ""must-have"" shows.",1322265600,,623,4.024193548387097

Although not as good as Ark II or Space Academy, Isis is much better than anything the Krofts came up with and I like Bigfoot& Wildboy. One thing you will notice is that the clothing is sometimes revealing, more than you would expect from a kid's show but nothing obscene(mini mini skirt, etc.). But hey, it was the 70's! People were a little more free to be themselves! Miss Cameron and Miss Pang are VERY attractive ladies to this day. Joanna was a model after all. Storm from the X-Men would be a good example of Isis' powers but Isis also controls earth and not just weather; animals as well. Overall, THE goddess of nature. Kids will like this for the action; teen boys will like it for the abnormally sexy women on a kid's show.

2839174,4,B000QQDEZG,"Watching these old episodes bring back so many memories. It is so amazing how ""back in my day"" these live shows were so cool, but yet compared to todays technology in TV, it seems so lame now.  But I used to pretend to be ISIS at recess while other guys were Batman, Superman, Aquaman etc from the Superfriends!!  I LEARNED THAT NO power was greater than a womans will. I learned that from my Grandmother, Mother, 3 Sisters, GodMother and later, my ex wife.

The quality is GREAT considering the age. You should share this with your kids!!! Because at the end... there are still lessons to be learned that can still be applied if you disucss it with them,  even in todays world.

 No amount of technology can replace human feelings and the ability to love, yearn, empathize, and learn from each other the power of honesty and love.

You will not regret this purchase and going down Sat morning memory lane!! If you lived in that time when this was on TV.

What is really amazing is.....my 4 and 6 year old sons are watching these shows with me, and they are hooked!

""Ohhhh mighty Isis""",1250640000,4,344,4.666666666666667
2839176,4,B000QQDEZG,"DISCLAIMER: This review does not apply to the extras, which I intend to view shortly after writing this.

Oh, Mighty Isis, you're pretty cool if I do say so myself.  Along with Wonder Woman, The Bionic Woman and any number of their spiritual sisters since, Isis was a different type of crimebuster, a kinder, gentler one who, though nice to all, could still get the job done as well as any man.  A staple of the transition between strictly Saturday morning and the regular programming which resumed after noon, Isis (along with her much dorkier male counterpart, Shazam, a.k.a. ""Captain Marvel"") was fun to watch, though not quite as memorable or substantive as the others.  Like bionic Jaime Sommers, her alter ego was a teacher, and like Wonder Woman, she relied on magic and traced her roots back to an ancient goddess.  But UNLIKE these others, Isis only had HALF the hour to herself, less when the occasional crossover episode saw her asking Shazam for help (something else which would become a fixture on The Bionic Woman a year later, and would work MUCH better there).

The writing was a mixed bag, and a small but significant turn for the worse accompanied Isis' short-lived run independent of her predecessor.  Since Joanna Cameron didn't participate in the interviews, it's almost too bad you can't just get the first two discs.  To enjoy this show, you'll also have to be willing to accept the magic source of Isis' powers, a definite drawback of this show as compared to the much better Bionic Woman.  After all, Isis descends literally from on high most times, and simply tells the elements what to do -- not much of a challenge except for thinking up appropriate rhyming couplets.  Still, this allows her to capture everyone without hurting a soul.

And in the end, it really doesn't matter, at least for the golden run of the series, to be found on the first two discs.  Standout episodes?  ""Fool's Dare"", where she is truly tender in her capture the bad guys, with a net and old tires, respectively, and the one later on, which is set in a ghost town, where she temporarily loses her power-bestowing amulet, and has to have her students help out.  Worth a miss?  ""Lucky,"" about the death of a pet -- too raw and real -- and ""The Hitchhikers"" on the last disc, for its cavalier treatment of a serious subject even as the rest of these final episodes were getting too serious, and alter ego Andrea Thomas was beginning to talk -- and sound -- like the smart alec Dianna Prince of Wonder Woman's second season.  As for the final two-parter, let's just say that the only REAL weather control device on TV of that era premiered four days later on rival network ABC as a FAR better THREE part combo Six Million Dollar Man/Bionic Woman story.  Please do NOT watch these back to back; stick with the first two thirds of Isis' run, minus ""Lucky"".  It's well worth it, and ultimately deserves to be rated on ITS OWN MERITS, not compared to its betters unless you're REALLY into female superheroes, in which case you'll probably feel as I do.

So, Oh mighty Isis, perk me up from feeling low, entertain me all night with your cool TV show!!!",1250380800,5,3147,4.617594254937163
2839177,5,B000QQDEZG,"Some memories are dulled by time, but after seeing this DVD set since its original airing on TV my recollections of this show were just as fondly rekindled as if I had seen them yesterday with a bowl (or box) of cereal in hand crouched in front of the set. (This scene being repeated in millions of homes on Saturday morning) JoAnna Cameron - at first - turned down the offer of playing Isis, however, I could not imagine anyone else but her being this character. Yes, there is a camp quality to the series several decades on but Ms. Cameron delivers her lines with a regal quality (She also has a beautiful dulcet speaking voice) There was something for everyone here in this series. If you are a male of a certain age - as I am - she was probably your first crush. For girls, she probably represented a female role model to look up to. And yes, I am sure some fathers were tuning in as well (I will admit she does have superb legs) For an introspective small town girl from Colorado to inspire such devotion from her fans is saying something. JoAnna Cameron was probably deserving of much better roles and there was probably some typecasting as a result of taking a role like this but without any disrespect to the other cast members, she really was this show. Her wholesome sex appeal and ""girl next door"" quality brought this very low budget affair to a higher level. On behalf of the legions and legions of prepubescent boys who were transfixed by your gaze on Saturday morning, Thank you Kamali'I wahine Isis.

2839182,5,B000QQDEZG,"Yes, I think she really is. Wonder Woman is good, and so is Supergirl and the She-Hulk, but Isis stands out with some major differences.

1. She can control the earth and the sky, essentially, EVERYTHING. How cool and powerful is that?!

2. You have to admit, the transformation process is really good.

3. The most important part of all is the moral of the episode(s). Superman really can't say that. And considering that the ""villains"" aren't necessarily people who wear ski masks and black gloves, it shows that even the most ordinary of people can make a mistake that needs super help.

The commentary is informative and the interviews with all the other casts members and behind the scenes people are wonderful and detailed. There's even a bonus cartoon featuring Isis and a collection of pictures of Isis toys and memorabilia. I wish every DVD set were as well put together as this set is.

I watched Isis as a kid. I had some of the comic books based on the show, too. I loved her. I wasn't interested in boy superheros. I wanted girl superheros, and at the time, the only other 3 I knew of (being only 8) was Wonder Woman, Batgirl and Supergirl. Wonder Woman was not a show on TV yet, nor was Supergirl and Batgirl was only seen here and there on Batman reruns. Isis was the first live action girl superhero to have her own show. However, it wasn't because she was first and only, but because she really is cool, that I loved her and still do. The power to command earth and sky pretty much covers it. Isis can fly like Supergirl and is strong like Wonder Woman, but unlike them, she can command air, time, water and land. She controls physics. That kind of makes her about as powerful as you can be, really.

Sure the picture is a little washed and looks dated. That's part of the charm, especially for those of us who watched it on TV first. But for me, I watched it on an old black and white TV, so this was a real treat to see it in color. Also, the lessons taught on the show still stand up today. We've come a long way on some issues, but there's still plenty of bigotry around and other lessons about ""being good"" or ""being responsible"" are as meaningful today as ever, maybe more so. I'm so glad to see these again and be able to share them with my daughter who thinks Isis is pretty cool, too.",1233792000,4,1927,4.262295081967213

This program was short-lived. Also shown as part of the ISIS/SHAZAM! POWER HOUR. But every episode has been digitally remastered and restored on three discs.

Though some of the episodes are corny (by today's standards), they had a lesson and there was no needless display of sex or cursing.  The special effects were obviously not very special (limited budget), but it's a great ride into the past, learning morals and values that should be applied today.

This DVD was a pleasure to watch and I recommend it to all who grew up during the 1970's because ISIS will fly back into your heart's once again!  Also, back then people didn't have to buckle up their seat belts or lock their vehicles.  The states didn't force citizens back then to buckle up or be fined heavily for what is considered breaking the law today.  Is that progress?  Or socialism?",1207353600,,598,4.342342342342342

With the exception of SHAZAM! they have all been released to DVD, which enables us all to go back to a simpler time, and a much more innocent time.

ISIS is a great series when you have the nostalgia to appreciate it. It is absolutely cheesy, and cheaply produced, but star Joanna Cameron always played her part with pride and nobility, and the stories contained morals and guidance for the young audience they were produced for.

Superhero Captain Marvel also makes a few appearances.

Recommended to fans of the 70s, and of superheroes!",1203897600,4,711,4.672
2839213,4,B000QQDEZG,"I saw an episode from the fourth season of Columbo called ""Negative Reaction,"" which starred Dick Van Dyke as a murderous photographer, and couldn't help but take note of the incredibly beautiful young woman that played Dyke's girlfriend. I looked her up on imdb and discovered that the woman, JoAnna Cameron, played the titular heroine in the 70s Saturday morning series ""The Secrets of Isis.""

This explains my interest in picking up this ""Isis"" dvd set, as I only vaguely recall the show as a kid; so there's very little nostalgic factor with me.

The set features all 22 episodes on two dvds and a handful of extras, including a 2-hour piece involving interviews with producers and stars, etc.

The show beat out the similar primetime series ""Wonder Woman,"" debuting Sept. 9, 1975. ""Wonder Woman"" didn't appear until sometime in 1976.

""The Secrets of Isis"" was a low-budget Saturday morning series and obviously geared toward kids. Each episode has a moral; the cast is upbeat, likable and multi-cultural; the vibe is simple and wholesome; and the F/X are cheap. Each segment only runs 20 minutes (not including credits) and the last two episodes feature Captain Marvel of ""Shazam!"" All that said, the show possesses a certain charm. One can't help but respect that JoAnna Cameron took the role seriously.

In the interview section the producers admit that they chose JoAnna to play Isis because she had ""great legs."" And so she does. In fact, it's the first thing I noticed about her when I saw that episode of ""Columbo."" JoAnna is fairly short and kind of thin, but curvy at the same time. In any case, her legs are truly exquisite. Her face and presence also exude great intelligence and poise. A very uniquely beautiful woman, to say the least. Lynda Carter of ""Wonder Woman,"" by contrast, was tall and ultra-voluptuous (I personally get sick at the sight of nigh-anorexic women). Another great 70s beauty was Erin Gray of ""Buck Rogers.""

BOTTOME LINE: Despite its numerous shortcomings noted above, ""The Secrets of Isis"" is worth picking up for those nostalgic of the show or those fascinated by JoAnna Cameron's great beauty, intelligence and poise; or both. And, by all means, watch it with your kids.",1203552000,6,2213,4.888
2839214,4,B000QQDEZG,"Nothing beats the 70's first TV heroine like Isis. Before Wonder Woman this Saturday morning superhero was the first of it's kind.

With great morals and some of the first issues brought up on children's tv such as a death of a pet, this groundbreaking series is a must. Great for all ages.",1203120000,2,381,4.617647058823529
2839215,4,B000QQDEZG,"First of all, I could not believe this was actually available on DVD.  Second, I could not believe I was buying it.  But the fact is, when I finally got around to watching it all I did was giggle like a little kid.  I remembered this show from years ago and watching it again brought back a lot of memories. The production value is totally cheesy (that's what happens when you have zero budget) and the acting isn't the greatest, but Isis is still a fun show to watch and I am glad that I bought it.  The extras were just OK.  Nothing much to write home (or a review) about, but interesting none-the-less.  I liked seeing what everyone in the series was up to these days.  My biggest regret was that Isis, herself, JoAnna Cameron, was not involved.
Overall, if you remember the show like I did from when you were a kid and you're feeling like you want to get in touch with the child you used to be, I'd say that you would enjoy watching this again.  I guarantee that if you did, you'd end up giggling just as much as I did.",1202774400,9,1023,4.183673469387755
2839216,4,B000QQDEZG,"They don't make 'em like this anymore, and it's a shame that they don't. If someone decided to ""re-imagine"" ISIS today, it'd most likely be a dark, dreary, serialized mess (two words: BIONIC WOMAN), chock full of  violence and lame attempts at being hip or ironic. Sure, ISIS had special ""effects"" that Ed Wood would've laughed at, and the show required not just a suspension, but an outright EXPULSION, of disbelief (for example, Isis's dimwitted male teacher pal could never figure out her obvious true identity, yet at one point we're supposed to believe that in his spare time he just so happens to be working for a secret government project in which he's invented a weather-controlling machine!) But this show was charming in its innocence, and star Joanna Cameron was very easy on the eyes. And it always had a positive message and a happy ending.

The extras are a mixed bag. The inclusions of an ISIS cartoon and production stills are to be applauded, but commentary from the show's producers is a waste of time (they don't remember a lot of specifics about the show, and their self-congratulatory remarks about creating a show that respected women are dealt a blow when they state that their main goal in selecting an actress to play the part of Isis was to find someone with ""great legs."") My advice: skip the commentary and interviews involving the producers, but check out everything else.

The audio-visual quality of the episodes themselves isn't as sharp as that in the ""Wonder Woman"" DVD's, to make the closest comparison that comes to mind as far as genre and era of production. However, it's hardly unwatchable, and as others have mentioned, it's all brightly lit (mainly because the series was shot pretty much entirely in daylight to keep expenses as low as possible.)

So watch the adventures of ISIS and her friends and I'm sure you'll agree, they just don't make 'em like this anymore. Long live ISIS on DVD!",1199836800,17,1931,4.78978978978979

2839228,5,B000QQDEZG,"Here's another series from the 70s that's been shelved for far too long.  At 40 years of age I'm among those who watched Saturday morning TV during this time, and Isis was one of my favorites.  Watching it 30 years later we understandably notice things we didn't back when we were 9 or 10, but it doesn't matter that much.  The nostalgia factor here is way off the scales.  With many of the storylines deriving from the Scooby Doo school of script writing this is 70s kitsch for sure, but as with Scooby Doo there's enough substance to render it still watchable today.  Many viewers will howl with laughter at some of the situations these teeangers get themselves into, and we all know there has to be a willing suspension of disbelief when it comes to no one ever figuring out that Andrea Thomas and Isis are the same person.  Even as a kid I laughed at how no one knew she was Isis, and how unbelievable some of the situations were.  Hard to believe any school would allow an uncaged pet crow or a homemade uranium-powered forcefield into a classroom, even in the 70s.  I didn't need to have morals instilled in me because I had a good family upbringing, but I did recognize the lessons that were being put across.  These morals are still relevant today.  The special effects are dated (the bear and gorilla suits would really make great Mystery Science Theater 3000 material!), as are the clothing and hair styles, and we also wonder when Miss Thomas and Mr. Mason actually taught classes since they spent a good deal of their school hours playing detective and helping their students out of trouble.  Also, how is it that everyone, villains and all, immediately recognizes Isis when they see her?  She appears and they invariably say something like, ""Oh, wow, it's Isis!"" Again, willing suspension of disbelief!

So what makes this so much fun?  First off, JoAnna Cameron is just so lovely to look at.  She has gorgeous legs and just oozes sex appeal without even trying.  Even as a kid I enjoyed looking at her every Saturday morning.  She made Andrea Thomas the hottest teacher ever, and Isis was really more sexy than Wonder Woman in my opinion.  They just don't have great-looking women like this in movies or on TV today.  Joanna Pang was attractive too in a different sort of way.  JoAnna Cameron also comes across as very sincere in her role, and you can almost believe she is playing herself.  In a few of the episodes she appears to really be having great fun playing Isis, such as in the scene where she uses a pile of old tires to capture the villains.  One of my favorite scenes in the entire series is in the Bigfoot episode when she walks up to the group of boys in the woods and tosses her hair back and says ""Hello, fellas!""  Pretty sexy for Saturday morning TV, but not smutty or demeaning in the least.

There's some really neat photography and locations here too.  In the Dreams of Flight episode you get to see some real murals that are somewhere in Los Angeles (one of the interviews on the DVD tells where they actually are).  There's lots of nice nature photography on display, such as a great (but brief) shot of a family of owls.  The locations all appear to be out in the country, with lots of panoramic views of tree covered land and blue sky.

Another fun aspect is some of the gadgetry that shows up.  There's the Circle Guard, a super-strong forcefield powered by uranium.  There's a projector that looks like a ray gun out of an old sci-fi flick that projects images of fake UFOs onto the clouds.  There's a singing Indian magician who has pellets he can toss on the ground to create explosions of light and smoke, and in Andrea's laboratory/classroom there's a gold leaf electroscope and a Van de Graaff generator among many other things.  Then there's Operation WeatherMaker, a device that can create storms.  Any of these gadgets could give the folks at GLUBCO or Amazing Concepts Inc. a run for their money, and as a person who builds Tesla coils, electrostatic machines, rockets, and other scientific curiosities as a hobby, they increased my enjoyment of this show both as a kid and now as an adult.

There's also a lot of familar guest stars, mostly character actors.  In the Sound of Silence episode there's Leigh McCloskey who went on to star in the cult favorite ""The Bermuda Depths.""  ""Lights of Mystery Mountain"" features Kelly Thordsen in one of his final roles, and ""Spots of the Leopard"" has Paul Jenkins, who made many later appearances including a few episodes of ""The Rockford Files.""  Mike ""Bobby Brady"" Lookinland also turns up in ""To Find a Friend.""  One reviewer stated that the show is ""full of people who never worked again"" but that is certainly not the case.  In addition to the many guest stars that graced the episodes, both Joanna Pang and Brian Cutler have had successful careers (her as a dancer and him as a teacher of acting).  JoAnna Cameron went on to do the brief Spiderman TV series and, later, a documentary on the Blue Angels.

Picture quality is good but probably not great.  Please remember this was a low budget 70s show, and was probably shot on cheaper film.  I watched it on both my laptop and my 27-inch Sony Bravia, and it looks pretty good for its age.  It's very bright and even washed out in some spots, but this is partly due to its having been shot in the summer and entirely in the daytime on hot sunny days. The extras are all good, especially the interviews with the cast and producers, but as others have pointed out JoAnna Cameron is not among those interviewed.  There are places on the net where you can read about how and why this unfortunate fact came to be.  There's lots of pictures of the cast and trailers for other Filmation shows, and even scripts which you can read on your computer.  Finally, it's not that expensive considering the nice packaging and all the extras that are included.

For any fan of the show or of JoAnna Cameron, buying this DVD should be a no-brainer.  It's great to have some of her work available, as it's still impossible to find her two films ""B.S. I Love You"" and ""It Couldn't Happen to a Nicer Guy"" (where, I kid you not, she plays a female sexual predator!) either on VHS or DVD.  Her Blue Angels documentary is out there to buy on VHS I think, but Isis is her real legacy.  This well-produced DVD set is a fantastic tribute to the show, even if she is not present in the interviews.  Seeing her in the Isis costume again is in itself worth the price of the DVD.

One of the best saturday morning super hero shows made.
The music is great.
The casting is great.
Isis was created as a companion show to Filmation's Shazam! (which featured DC character Captain Marvel).
The episodes were soon shown back to back as ""The Shazam/Isis Hour"".
Now BCI owns the Isis series, and Warner Bros owns the Shazam! series.
In 3 episodes, Isis calls on the help of Captain Marvel, creating a crossover. Subsequently, in episodes of Shazam, Isis guest stars occasionally. In the first of these Shazam! episodes, Billy Batson says (in reference to Isis's bird Tut), ""That's the bird that contacted Captain Marvel, when Isis needed help (a pretextual reference to a scene from the Isis series). So the continuity between both shows was well written in 1975.

But when I say fond memories I mean that I remember seeing and enjoying it but my actual recollection of the individual episodes is almost zero save for the fact that Isis had a secret identity and could fly and control the weather.
Watching the episodes have transported me back to the age of saturday morning cartoons and live action series like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ark-II-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000IU37UC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ark II: The Complete Series</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jason-of-Star-Command-The-Complete-Series/dp/B000NDI3OY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jason of Star Command - The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;and of course the Shazam-Isis hour.
The episodes ara fantastic, but only if you lived through the era of saturday morning cartoons, otherwise they will seem hopelessly corny. Isis is played with serene dignity by the beautiful Joanna Cameron who has the power of flight and many others like stopping time and telekenisis. Despite having the powers of a goddess, Isis dedicates herself to helping kids in trouble or who have gone astray. The lovely Joanna Pang as Cindy Lee (first season) and Rick Mason round out the cast nicely as friends of Andrea Thomas (Isis' alter ego).
Some have complained about the image quality but I saw it just fine, with the exception of some of Isis' flying scenes which do seem a bit blurry, but hey, the show is 30 years old!
The extras are very good, comprised mostly of interviews, however the recollection by the producers regarding anecdotes about the series was hazy at best. The best one was the interview with Joanna Pang (Cindy Lee) who spoke fondly of her time on the show. A glaring omission is commentary by Isis herself - Joanna Cameron!

Writing a review for this childhood series of mine is more a labor of love than anything else.
The Shazam/Isis hour and later ""The Secrets of Isis"" series were two shows that have stuck with me since childhood, and one I shall take with me through the sands of time and throughout my lifetime.
Why did these two shows resonate so much with me growing up? What did these shows convey that made them so memorable for me are things I want to express here in my review. I also want to convince fans to buy this wonderful series that still holds up today over 30 years later. Finally available on DVD, The secrets of Isis, is a long time in coming, and it is a series that I want to express my sincere feelings about. These are the topics about this wonderful DVD and Saturday Morning television show that I want to write about are: The interviews and the commentary; JoAnna Cameron's speaking voice (so calming and soothing), the famous (thought provoking 30 second morals) at the end of each episode and the background music, which became an extra in the DVD as ""the isolated background music,"" tracks.
Growing up in the 1970s I watched Saturday morning TV. I don't remember the first time I watched Shazam, but I do remember really liking it and making a connection that would forever stick. I am a very emotional person and really noticed and connected to the background music in a profound way. It would never leave my soul and at the age of 41 still lives with me. Then Shazam introduced Isis, and she would have her own show following his and the two shows merged and became, ""The Shazam/Isis hour."" I would look forward to seeing Isis in her own series each and every week in a new exciting adventure. Like all good things, these shows 28 episodes for Shazam, and 22 episodes of Isis came to an end including airing repeats the shows would not be seen or heard from again. Shazam reruns came back for a short time in the early eighties plus 3 episodes with guest star Isis, and that was that. The shows may have left the air but they never left my soul especially the background music, JoAnna Cameron wonderful speaking voice and those morals. Everything in its proper place, but when something has a profound effect on you you don't want to lose it, and when it was gone there was an empty space left inside me.
Finally after thinking I would never see this Saturday morning show ever again, I did get a chance to obtain them on Video in the early 1990s, with most deleted of the wonderful morals, however I was lucky to obtain 5 of those 30 second morals on some of the videos. Now finally on DVD I like so many fans not only have a chance to see the episodes clear and crisp and not a copy of a copy of a copy, but also filled with wonderful extras. Interviews with

the main cast (despite the biggest disappointment not having JoAnna Cameron the star, not wanting to be included in this one-time-only event) Interviews, with the creator and writers, designer and directors, were wonderful except that the interviews were in small box, why not a full screen. (I hope they do the Shazam interviews on a full screen not a box in a box. Otherwise they were wonderful to see and learn about the making of such a wonderful series. I was very happy to see commentary on at least one episode called, ""Dreams of Flight.""
  For years since I obtained the shows on video I would put the episodes on audio to listen to on the road on my headphones. I would also tape all the scenes with the same background music from the show and put them on audio as well. Yvette Blais and Jeff Michael wrote some of the most beautiful background music I have ever heard and will cherish them until the day I leave this world. I saw the background music as important and a part of each scene and episode as the actors and the storylines were. Both the theme songs for both Captain Marvel and Isis were incredibly awesome. There was action music to fit the scene, or when the scene needed to be tender and emotional, I felt it and connected with it. If you really listened you could hear the different instruments being played for each piece of music, a harp, flute, and a sweet violin. I can get overly sentimental and mushy over the music, but that is how it has made me feel all my life to this day.  I just wished something or anything was said about it, which made this show even more memorable in the interviews and commentary segments.  Thank you Yvette Blais and Jeff Michael for the music you both so beautifully created. I truly wish I knew where to write and thank you and obtain a photograph of what you both look like.
JoAnna Cameron was the perfect person to portray both Andrea Thomas and Isis. She was beautiful to look at and sexy in the Isis mini skirt and shoe boots. She didn't have to say a word, and would say a million things with her eyes, facial expressions, and body movements. But the one thing that grabbed me about JoAnna portraying both characters was her speaking voice. Her voice had an innately calming, soothing effect when she spoke. Her speaking voice, a gift from G-d exuded caring, compassion, kindness and a calming effect that could put anyone at ease. I always say, if I or someone were suffering a traumatic experience or going thru a trauma in their life that JoAnna Cameron's calming voice could get them thru it. I have always been attracted to wonderful speaking voices whether they are male or female and always compare those to JoAnna Cameron's. When I die and hopefully go to heaven it is the speaking voice of JoAnna Cameron's that I hope welcomes me into the gates of heaven. So thank you JoAnna Cameron, I hope your life is a healthy and happy one

and sorry you couldn't join the interviews. When the Shazam series becomes available there is still hope that JoAnna Cameron is available to be interviewed for the interview segments.
I enjoyed the rest of the cast as well including Brian Cutler, JoAnna Pang, Ronalda Douglas, and Albert Reed. From Andrea Thomas/Isis, to the rest of the cast each had wonderful qualities and if we have friends in our life like them we should consider ourselves very lucky. Andrea Thomas portrayed a teacher that made her students feel they could do and achieve anything no matter what the odds. As we grew we may also have been lucky if
 we had teachers like that in our own lives, because we will always remember them as I have Andrea Thomas and Isis.
It was great to have commentary on the ""Dreams of Flight"" episode, and would have been just as wonderful to have another episode with the cast members doing a commentary.
Watching the show for years on Video and as each episode would end minus the morals I knew something important was missing and there was. Those thirty-second thought provoking morals. Each story gave a message and a moral and it made each story complete. Each moral was never ever preachy; it just gave you a piece of wise sage to think about and hopefully follow. I thought I would never see them again, and when my friend Max told me that they were cut out of the original masters it made me so sad to think I would never get to see them again, they had meant so much to me. As the theme music played in the background Isis' soft soothing voice gave the moral to the story that had just ended. When I heard that in one of the ""special features"" on the DVD, they would have rare scenes such as the morals, I became happy, but thought they would only include the ones that myself and collectors already had and nothing more. But as I bought ""The Secrets of Isis"" on my birthday I went straight to the morals and I was surprised beyond belief. Not only did they have the morals that I already had but many, many more I did not. I was so overwhelmed and emotional  that my dream had come true, for the first time in almost thirty years those cherished thirty- second morals that I missed so much and thought would never see again was here to watch, enjoy and remember. The series and the morals still holds up today for me as it did when I first watched them on Saturday Morning in the seventies. I felt so blessed to see them again.
Excitedly, I looked forward to the ""isolated background music"" since I am a major fan of the shows background music. But I do wish they would have included episodes such as ""Lucky"" and ""Dreams of Flight"" since the background music was incredible in both, and wondered if the episodes that were chosen for the ""isolated background music"" were the only ones available or just chosen at random?

I hope when the Shazam series becomes available that they use more ""isolated background music"" since the background music in Isis was the same as Shazam. I hope they include such episodes as  ""The Odd Couple"", ""Riptide"" and a couple from season one that had the same music as in ""Dreams of Flight"" from the Isis series. Andy Mangels if you read this please use your contacts and tell the powers that be when doing the Shazam series please tell them what the fans want, including the Shazam morals. As fans we would be so thankful. Thanks for your help and thanks so much for the wonderful work on ""The secrets of Isis DVD.""  Many times through the years, I thought I would never, ever see this series again and now not only do I have them, but they are wonderfully restored with the morals and so many extras.
So this is my homage, testimony, sincere love and sincerity that my favorite series of all time due to JoAnna Cameron, her soft soothing speaking voice, the compassion and kindness she exuded, the background music and thirty-second morals that were so powerful, that it in part helped me to become the man that writes this today. I hope I am a more caring, compassionate and honorable individual because of this show. So yes go out and buy this DVD and show it to the next generation so it will never be forgotten. This is a show with substance and meaning that should travel through time never losing what it set out to do, to entertain and include a message and a moral to young viewers as I too was once.",1188777600,9,10094,4.439050701186623
2839237,4,B000QQDEZG,"Most people probably won't appreciate this set, but as a kid watching this with the companion, Shazam will find themselves trasported back to when they too were sitting there before the limited number of channels we had then and the innocence of Saturday morning cartoons.  I couldn't give it 5 stars simply because of the acting is pretty lame at times, but it shouldn't keep anyone from appreciating it simply for the camp value.  I still love it and I am glad to have it apart of my dvd collection.",1188777600,5,501,4.555555555555555

2839250,5,B000QQDEZG,"After watching ISIS again on dvd's, I realized how much has changed over the past 30 years.  We don't see these kind of shows on tv anymore. Our children need positive role models to show them the way to act morally and responsibly.  ISIS and CAPTAIN MARVEL both team up occasionally to teach lessons and save lives.  In the end, the ""victims"" have learned a valuable lesson that I am sure had helped them shape their destiny toward becoming responsible adults.",1187827200,10,461,4.666666666666667

2839252,5,B000QQDEZG,"As a kid I got up every Saturday morning to watch Isis.  Over 30 years later it's still fun to see these episodes again.  Technology has changed so much in the past several years and these special effects might seem hokey to today's kids, but in my day it was great seeing her fly and work her powers over nature as Isis.

Joanna Cameron is one of the most beautiful actresses and I wish she had done more.  She was able to deliver lines like ""Oh zephyr winds that blow on high, lift me now so I can fly"" with such believeablity, even by today's standards.

The extras show interviews with Brian Cutler, who played Rick Mason, and Joanna Pang, who played Cindy Lee.  But there was none with Ms. Cameron.  I wish there were more information about her as to how she felt about being an icon of the 70's and what she's doing today.

If you were a fan of this show I think you'll really like it.  It was good to watch a TV show from a more innocent time where there was a hero who would win in the end.  I was able to watch this with a five year old and not worry about any ""adult"" content popping up.  That was refreshing!",1187136000,43,1119,4.110599078341014
2839253,5,B000QQDEZG,"I have already watched the entire DVD set and extras.  I thoroughly loved it and was left wishing they'd made more episodes.  Too bad the ""lessons""/""morals"" had been omitted from the master episodes in the 1990s.  I really missed those tagged at the end of every episode.  On the extras, however, there are a few gleaned from video transfers.

The stories are surprisingly relevant and I was happy to get my 6 year old niece into Isis.  She loved it!  It's just long enough to develop a plot, but not too long to bore kids.

I found myself surpised at how many episodes I remembered from childhood.  It was just great and I wholeheartedly recommend the set.

One teensy thing: I was really wishing Joanna Cameron was interviewed for the DVD extras, but oh well. *shrug*  The other principal actors are there.

Now, if we could just get Shazam! released, we'd have ALL the Isis-containing live action episodes made by Filmation, since Isis guest starred on Shazam! several times.",1187049600,8,978,4.72189349112426

2839255,5,B000QQDEZG,"The show you all know you watched is back,in an excellent DVD.Its the mid 70s,and it sure screams it....1974 VW Things,1975 Firebirds,old Galaxies,Camaros,even a Toyota Corona thrown in. Yet,all of this does not distract from the core message that still holds true to this day...respect one another,respect nature,and do the right thing. The message of this show and Shazam! was always positive,and for that Filmation did a good deed. Not all childrens shows pushed such positivity...Popeye promoted beating up the bully,RoadRunner made the mistake in saying that one (Coyote)cannot injure or kill themself with explosives (or large drops onto stone),...and it goes on and on...
The missing link in this release is the lack of commentary or interview with Joanna Cameron. Obviously they ignored her,or else she refused,but her glaring omission is the major flaw in an otherwise complete work. Hopefully they do their homework when Shazam! is released...even including any vintage interviews Les Tremayne may have did regarding his time on the show.",1186790400,4,1048,5.396341463414634
2839256,4,B000QQDEZG,"I remember watching 'Isis' on TV long ago with my niece. Both of us loved her and the series. A superheroine/goddess who bends the laws of Nature to her will by verbalising rhyming couplets is simply 'cool'. :) It's a joy in this respect to see her in action again after all these years, and relive all the fond memories. The picture quality of the DVDs is reasonably good on the whole. My only complaints concern the concept and storyline.

First, Isis is the ONLY being from Egyptian mythology ever to appear in the entire series. I can't understand why. To me this amounts to a total failure to exploit the core concept of the series, which could be where its greatest potential lies. Imagine if other members of the Egyptian pantheon or other elements of ancient Egypt were to appear at times, some to help and others to cause trouble. Maybe Andrea's friend Mason could assume the role of Osiris in one episode? Maybe a mummy in a museum could be awakened by the power of Andrea's amulet in another? If you're not gonna have such things, then what significance is there in having a superheroine based on Egyptian myth? She might just as well be based on Celtic myth, or advanced alien technology, or whatever.

I also can't understand why Capt Marvel is put into a couple of the episodes. How does he fit in? There's no account of his origins and how he met and teamed up with Isis. He's just placed liberally into the series, that's it.
The action also feels inconsistent at times. In one episode, Isis had to jump into the sea and swim to a drowning boy and his dog to save them. Why? Couldn't she just call on the winds to lift them out of the water? If there's any special reason, the series didn't say what it is.

Finally, why is there no interview with Joanna Cameron herself?

But I guess I might be nitpicking. It's still an enjoyable series on the whole. Always love the little moral lessons offered in Filmation productions. :)",1186617600,,1942,4.492917847025495
2839257,5,B000QQDEZG,"I find it interesting that we compare the quality of current film to that of the 1970s.  I remember watching this on a TV, with a pair of plyers as a remote.  I was impressed that the quality correction was as good.  Yes, some grainyness will occur, but think of what they had to work with. It did not look bad at all on my HD 50 inch.

For those of us that have waited since childhood to see our favorite Goddess,  little chance you will be disappointed.  Be true fans of the series, not the shortcomings of our film ancestors.

It was more fun watching the irregularities, such as flying in heals, landing, then flat shoes are on her feet.  How the Red car with WHITE interior, became a Yellow car with BLACK interior. (the paint is explained).

Buy to have fun with and figure out why we could not wait for the Shazam / Isis hour.  You will be just as trapped.  If you are a film snob, maybe you should pass.  When TV aired all these great classics that are now remasted, remember they became classics in the ""grainy"" mode.  We didn't seem to mind then.  Thats half the fun.  Cant wait for the Shazam DVDs.

Watch, smile, laugh and enjoy.  Maybe we did learn a lesson or two from this as kids.",1186444800,9,1196,4.221238938053097
2839258,4,B000QQDEZG,"THE SECRETS OF ISIS dvd set is a show that only people who grew up in the United States (and Canada, I'm told)during the 70s can appreciate. It's part of the historical phenomenon that has become known as ""Saturday Morning"" tv, which was a programming block on all three major networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) with shows aimed specifically at children. The block began around 7AM till about 12PM (if memory serves me) and always on Saturday mornings. No matter what walk of life a person has come from, if you ask anyone of a certain age that grew up in the U.S., they will remember Saturday mornings as waking up early (without being asked), sitting in a bean-bag chair, eating cereal and glued to the the tv set.

I only mention this because those who are not familiar with these Saturday morning shows might be disappointed with this dvd set. First off, as one reviewer has stated, the picture quality isn't as good as one would hope. Even though the shows have been digitally remastered, they seem to be a little washed out in color. The picture itself is sharp, but has a fuzzy quality that either has to do with the lighting or the deterioration of the original prints. Either way the shows look dated.

The second thing that might bother some viewers is the special effects. This was before the digital age and many of the special fx shots are painfully obvious. Most consist of superimposing Joanna Cameron as ""Isis"" against a filmed backdrop of aerial shots for flying scenes, I think they call this a process shot, and of running film backwards or pausing it. Anyway, it makes shows like ""Wonder Woman"" seem light years ahead in the special effects department.

And I'm not knocking it! I know THE SECRETS OF ISIS was done in 1975 and the budget was very SMALL so they did the best they could. And again, this was aimed at kids but I thought you'd want to know. Also, if you were expecting lots of action scenes between Isis and the bad guys you'll probably be let down. There were more fight scenes in the second season of ""Dynasty"" then there are in ""...ISIS."" Most action shots consist of Isis flying, landing, saying an incantation and making things all right...don't expect the heroine to be running around and jumping and throwing grown men around like rag dolls i.e. ""Wonder Woman"" or ""The Bionic Woman."" Perhaps this was due in part because THE SECRETS OF ISIS was the first live action female super hero to have her own show (Batgirl was part of BATMAN) and they didn't know how far to push the envelope.

Anyway, the dvd set contains 22 episodes with a couple of appearances by Captain Marvel (SHAZAM) and each show presents a moral or cautionary tale i.e. don't hitchhike, don't cheat, respect yourself etc., that teaches kids (without them knowing) about values, and does so without being too scary or preachy. Another thing that was a big plus is the use of a multi-racial cast. Even though they were minorities, the supporting characters like ""Cindy Lee"" and ""Rennie Carol"" come off as just other Americans and not stereo types. Didn't realize it then, but I see it now.

Also included is bonus features like interviews with producers Lou Scheimer and Richard M. Rosenbloom, and co-stars Brian Cutler (Rick Mason), Joanna Pang Atkins (Cindy Lee), Ronalda Douglas Lomabardo (Rennie Carol), as well as writers of the show and the assistant director Henry J. Lange Jr. Joanna Cameron is not included in the interviews.

One thing that I didn't like about the interviews, and I saw this same thing on another Filmation dvd set of ""The Archies,"" was that the interview is shown picture-in-picture. The interview is in a small box that's placed over scenes from the show. It's not too big a deal but annoying. And on the ISIS dvd, you have to play the interviews one at a time.

Also in the special features is an animated episode of ""The Plant Soldiers"" from the show The Freedom Force, starring Isis. A small tri-fold pamphlet is included in the dvd set with a brief synopsis of the show, episode titles (including air and shoot dates, description, trivia), and info on the special features.

All in all this set should satisfy any ISIS/SATURDAY MORNING fan. But again, if you're not familiar with the show, rent it first. And if you do remember the show but can't remember any specifics about it, as long as you can live with the stuff I mentioned above you'll enjoy THE SECRETS OF ISIS dvd set.",1186272000,22,4408,4.649550706033376
2839259,5,B000QQDEZG,"I just got this DVD box set yesterday. I'm very happy since I already wait more than 15 years to watch back this series.

I still remember I watch Isis during I still in primary school. During that time, I didn't know this series call ""The Secret of Isis"". But I love this series. Unlucky, this series very short and only 2 season with 22 episode. After it finish, no more reproduction until today.

During that time, I hope our Malaysia TV will repeat few year later. Unlucky, I wait a so many year also no repeat. Finally, I choose to buy the whole series but fail.

Begining of this year, I try to get from internet. Finally I got it but the quality was very bad cos that was transfer from VHS Tape. I'm very disappointed for this thing happen.

Lucky, I know the original DVD for this series would out by 25/7/2007. So I buy it again from amazon.

When I get the DVD, I'm very happy. Eventhough the quality of picture not so high as per I expected, but at least 10 times better than my previous one. A lot of additional features regarding this series on this DVD where we hard find it from internet.

Excellent packaging, extras and special features made it seem like this set of DVDs was what I've been looking forward to for so many years.  Then I played one of the DVDs....to say the picture quality is poor is being nice.  I thought it was just the first episode, but I checked through all the others....same problem and same washed-out looking print.  Honestly, these episodes look like an old 38mm film that has been setting out in the sun for 20 years.  Audio reproduction is a little better than the video, but not by much.  The overall quality, despite the dvd box claiming the episodes have been ""digitally remastered"", is akin to that of a 4th generation bootleg you'd buy off of some auction site.  This has really and truly depressed me.  To be fair, I do have to hand it to Entertainment Rights and the other parties involved regarding their efforts in finally bringing this (formerly) great series to DVD.  However, I find it hard to believe that these are the best prints available of this series.  I saw several clips from ""Isis"" on the VH1 show ""I Love The 70's"" and they looked much better than what is present on these discs.  I hate to give this series a less than ""Rah-Rah"" review, but less than die-hard fans of ""Isis"" may be disappointed with what they find here.",1185667200,16,1446,4.498084291187739
2839262,5,B000QQDEZG,"TV show box sets are great, but every now and then one comes along that just catapults you back to your childhood and ""ISIS"" is one of them.  I had so much fun watching this over the past week that I felt like I was seven years old all over again.  The show was really well done considering the obvious lack of budget.  I've pretty much like all of the live action shows that Filmation did and can't wait for them to release ""Shazam!"".  ""ISIS"" was my favorite though!  She's a very different type of super hero.  After she turns from Andrea to ISIS, she sort of just poses for the camera, not really in a hurry to save anyone.  And when she gets there she pretty much just points at rocks or tree branches and has them do her work for her.  If you check out the manicure on ISIS you'd know why she doesn't want to ruin her nails.
The extras are outstanding as well.  An ISIS cartoon I've never seen before, and several interviews are included.",1185667200,47,943,4.223463687150838

2839264,5,B000QQDEZG,"It has been entirely too long for ""The Secrets of Isis"" to be released on DVD, but when the rights to the show go into the hands of the right company, magically things can happen, and that's exactly what has happened here.

All twenty-two episodes of the show are here in amazing quality. The menu graphics and box art are outstanding. Unfortunately Hallmark owned the rights to the show for several years and during that time they transferred the original prints to PAL and then trashed the originals. Why they did this is beyond me and quite frankly they should be ashamed of themselves. In the process of this transfer, they chopped off the ending ""moral message"" that is found on many Filmation Productions programs. Thankfully, the rights were sold to BCI Eclipse and that's why we finally have the DVD release.

The DVD set for ""The Secrets of Isis"" contains almost two hours of extra features. There are indepth interviews with all the cast members, unfortunately aside from JoAnna Cameron and with many involved with the production of the show. In addition to the interviews are photo galleries, copies of all the scripts in PDF format and many commercial bumpers and alternate credits. In addition, almost all the ending ""moral messages"" from the first season have been included. These have been compiled from the videotapes of fans throughout the world, most of which were captured on Betamax back in the late 70s and early 80s. The quality of the morals vary wildly and come nowhere near the quality of the episodes, however, BCI Eclipse should be applauded for allowing the inclusion of these on the DVD set. As a child during the original run of the show, the moral messages strengthened what my parents taught me and had a definite hand in the moral foundation of my adult life.

For any fan of quality Saturday morning programming, Filmation Productions, comic book superheroes or for just a trip to memory lane, ""The Secrets of Isis"" is a must have and a no brainer!!",1185494400,13,1983,4.775510204081633
2839265,5,B000QQDEZG,"It's about time they officially released this series. Too bad the people who own these series always wait so long to release them. They are just lucky they have die hard fans that loved some of these shows or they'd make zilch on them now. They would sit on some studio shelf rotting away until their destroyed.
  What I always loved about ISIS is it's sense of wholesomeness and its ongoing sense of adventure. ISIS was a hero to look up to, and better portrayed it than any of todays so-called ""hero's"" She was not violent and didn't carry a machine gun. She did not use foul language. No wonder it's not on tv anymore! The point is, today we have do not have positive heroes to look up to. Todays kids are introduced to mostly violent programming and inappropriate content. The Simpsons are a good example of that. I do not find the show funny or good for kids.  I grew up with ISIS, SHAZAM, WONDER WOMAN, THE BIONIC WOMAN, THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN. When my generation were kids we all wanted to be one of these heroes. We had a reason to stay home on a Friday and Saturday night with our families and watch these shows together. We still talk about and cherish those times now. I'm at the age of 41 now and they have just finally released the first 2 seasons of the Bionic Woman on region 2 dvd and the Six Million Dollar Man, and 2 years ago Wonder Woman series. I own all of what is available of these shows and I have the kids I work with view them now and then. Some kids love them, and others are not even slightly interested in them. The ones that don't like them think they don't have enough action. What they really want is all that phony computer generated and overly fast paced junk that looks much more fake than when they actually used to do it the hard way and have actual stunts.
  Oh well, I could go on and on, but the important thing about ISIS and SHAZAM is that these shows were kid friendly, had morals to be learned, and showed young people to they could be real hero's too. I saw the comments about her being a sexual device, but that was never part of the shows intention. JoAnna Cameron was lovely and in my opinion had the look of innocence and purity much like Lynda Carter always has, but the show was not about sex for me. Funny though, JoAnna was one of the prettiest women I have ever seen and when she was ISIS, ""WOW!"" Even though she wore much more than Wonder Woman, she was still incredible.
  I would recommend this show to anyone who has small children, and it is just so much fun for adults too, especially if you like the transistion to good ""clean"" viewing.",1185148800,5,2602,4.276422764227642
2839266,5,B000QQDEZG,"Way back when, Isis was my favorite TV show. Unlike SHAZAM!, Isis was more a crimefighter than a social worker. But, beyond that, I was always intrigued by star JoAnna Cameron. The actress even than was rather distant and reclusive. I remember reading stories that she would always keep to herself rarely speaking to the other actors. So, it's a shame, it appears she was not interviewed for the DVD release. That I still remember the show and it's star so well after more than half a lifetime speaks well for the quality of the entire production.",1184889600,9,547,4.649484536082475
2839267,5,B000QQDEZG,There was two shows I was addicted to on Saturday mornings as a kid one was Sabrina The Teenage Witch cartoons the other was ISIS!! I LOVED this show and I CAN'T wait to see her again after almost thirty something years!! Why they haven't ran these on American pay TV is a surprise to me. Even if it was for Saturdays on a TV channel like TV Land it would have been great but at least now we can OWN these fun shows from our childhood.  Reading the extra features and seeing the bang up cover art is awesome and looks excellent!! I can't wait to see this again....Only wish theyd release Sabrina cartoons too..Come on Filmation owners give us Sabrina too you gave us Groovy Goolies and now The Archie Show & Isis WHERE is Sabrina!!!????:),1184284800,16,738,4.3478260869565215
