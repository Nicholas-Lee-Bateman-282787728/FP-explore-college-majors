This is what I have been waiting for. Several people gave this 1 or 2 stars because everyone is spoiled by HD. It still looks very very good, I don't need to be able to count the spots on Mikey's head to enjoy this incredible show. To everyone who rated this awesome product low because ""boo hoo its not on Blu-ray"", quit being such babies and be glad we even got a complete season. 5 stars all the way!",1412467200,,577,4.254545454545455

6492934,5,B00LN87984,"I too would love a Blu-ray release, but the show is just far too good for me to rate it anything lower than a five.  If you are a newcomer and wondering if it is worth buying a whole season sight unseen, IT IS.

If you find yourself having trouble adjusting to the style of the show, stick with it.  If you get to the third or fourth episode and you don't love it, I'll eat my hat.

I came late to the show, so this full season release is perfect for me.  I can't wait for the second season full set though, so I'll be grabbing the single disc ""sucker"" releases.

The animation is excellent, there's equal measures of fun and action, the storyline is long-running and well thought out, and the characters all shine as well-developed individuals.

I went out and bought the first two DVD sets out of curiosity since I heard they have love interests and had to see it for myself. Then I was hooked and went out to buy them all and binge watched them straight through the fourth of July. It's my favorite incarnation and I seriously doubt any other will be better than this one. Buy this set together as it's the best bang for your buck, but you'll also most likely binge watch them too.

6492983,5,B00LN87984,"- Sensei Splinter: ""The first rule of being a ninja is do no harm... unless you mean to do harm, then do lots of harm.""

There's much to love about this Nickelodeon CG-animated series. Creators Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird won't be turning over in their graves because this show honors their source material and, also, because they're not dead yet. It takes its cues from the original comic books yet contructs its own mythology. Anyway, old-timey fans of the turtles are already clued in that each iteration plays havoc with established continuity. Splinter may simply be a rat mutated to sentience or he may have been originally a human mutated into a rat. Karai may be Shredder's adopted daughter or merely a high-ranking official in the Foot Clan. April O'Neil may be a news reporter or computer programmer or a teenaged girl. So it goes.

In terms of broadcasting history, it's third in TMNT's animated runs on television, fourth incarnation overall if you count that short-lived live action show (that had the female turtle Venus de Milo). But it may be my favorite of them all. Nickelodeon has assembled a strong vocal cast (ie: Sean Astin as ""Raphael,"" Jason Biggs as ""Leonardo""), and I happen to think that Hoon Lee's Splinter carries much more gravitas than Danny Woodburn's lightweight take in the 2014 Michael Bay-produced film.

The Shell Racer. ""This is Carlos Chiang O'Brien Gambe, reporting..."" ""Booyakasha!"" Those are just some of the things I love about the show. I love the scads of smart-aleckry going on. The humor is infectious, with Michelangelo the standout in bringing the funny. Mikey is very endearing. Each episode is packed with high-spirited action but also with a sense of family. These 15-year-old siblings indulge in petty bickering and rivalries but they always come together when it really counts. The CG work is amazing, and I don't know if it was done tongue-in-cheek but I also savored the occasional Matrixy/Michael Bay visual/audio effect. Mutagen, that familiar ooze, is very much in play when it comes to originating a batch of villains (and the occasional ally) for the turtles. My favorite bad guys are, hands down, the Kraang. I love everything about them, their tortured syntax and their visual aesthetic (icky alien brain lodged in a robot host's torso). Nickelodeon has successfully introduced the ninja turtles to a new generation.

The Season One episodes:

- Episode 10 - ""Panic in the Sewers"" - Already demoralized by their recent defeat at the hands of Shredder, the turtles hear a rumor that Shredder plans to attack them in their sewer home.

- Episode 22 - ""The Pulverizer Returns!"" - Thanks to copious turtle beatdowns, the Shredder's ninja Foot clan is so decimated it recruits even someone as non-athletic and oblivious as the Pulverizer. As Mikey muses: ""Wow, they must really be hurtin' for dudes."" As a lesson against complacency, Splinter orders the turtles to swap weapons.

Iwas behind the curve on this new series so i missed the first season, and when i watch it for the first time i was reluctant since it wasn't my famed original cartoony turtles. But once i started watching, i realized that they did a fantastic job of bringin these characters and the whole concept back to life.
  This box set includes the previously released ""Rise of the Turtles"" dvd, ""Enter Shredder"" dvd, and ""Ultimate Showdown"" dvd, all in one boxset. Im not sure why they released the season in three different volumes (like they are doing for season 2 also), other than too make money by releasing them seperatly, then releasing them together in a package a year later. Still, this is a great package and it also includes a booklet containing a brief history of the turtles.

It features three DVDs:  Ultimate Showdown, Enter Shredder, and Rise of the Turtles.  The show aired 2012-2013.  I like that it is broken down into three DVDs, with a total of over 600 minutes.  I will say though if you are buying this as a gift, the child may already have the DVDs separately so consider that.  Having the DVDs separate makes it easy to watch one or more episodes at one time.  While they are not the same Turtles I grew up with, they are great for a new generation.

I've been of a TMNT fan ever since I saw the first episode of the original series back in 1987, but I was a little skeptical of the computer-animation being used for the new incarnation. Once I saw the Rise Of The Turtles, all my worries were over. The series is actually well-made, has a great voice cast and it has become its own show, but at the same time it has paid homage to the 1987 and 2003 cartoons. Last year, Nickelodeon released the entire first season in three volumes (Rise of the Turtles, Enter Shredder and Ultimate Showdown), which did upset some diehard fans as they wanted the complete season set. Now, those fans are finally getting their wish, but they might be slightly disappointed with this release. Besides from the cool cover-box and the coffee table booklet, there is nothing new here. Actually, the same three volumes are included in this set, so if you have already purchased the previous releases, then there is no reason to buy it. The good news is that the set is only retails at $35.98 and is currently being sold on Amazon for $12.96, which is about the same price of just one of the volumes. Overall, I did enjoy watching the episodes on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Complete First Season. If you don't already own the volumes, then I recommend buying this set as you can't beat the price.

6492992,5,B00LN87984,"This show is great. From a content perspective, you can't lose. I am a fan of the original cartoon and movies and i feel like this is a much better series. The turtles are fun and their is a peristent story.

This collection is literally a repackage of the 3 season one dvds. I was really hoping for a blu ray release, but the quality here is quite good for a DVD collection.

This is a good buy for fans of the original and new comers alike.",1412812800,,442,4.068965517241379
6492993,4,B00LN87984,"5 stars for value, 3 stars for packaging, overall 4 stars.  First of all, to those who already own the original sets and are thinking of picking this complete season up to relieve your shelf of some bulk, don't ""shell"" out the dough!  I repeat, it is NOT worth picking up if you already own the three separate volumes because this set IS the three separate volumes packed into a slip cover that says the complete first season. Yes, you read that right, the box set INCLUDES three separate DVD cases that are each standard DVD size.  DVD one says nickelodeon TMNT Rise of the Turtles, DVD two says nickelodeon TMNT Enter Shredder, and DVD three says nickelodeon TMNT Ultimate Showdown. The artwork is exactly the same as the individual releases, nothing has changed. The only thing new you get here is a huge slipcover that houses all 3 dvds.  When I recieved this in the mail today I was surprised until i realized this was released by paramount.  Paramount is NOTORIOUS for ""re-shelling"" the same old stuff over and over again.  This is why it took so long to get a complete season set, and why the complete season set is the same exact thing already released!  So packaging for this product gets 3 stars, and that is probably more than it deserves.

Now on to the positive side of things!  The set overall get 5 stars for value because the show is great, and the value was hard to pass up.  I didn't mind ""shelling"" out the $13 cash because I didn't feel like I was flushing money down into the ""sewer"".  Personally, I am glad I waited, because the price I paid for this entire set was the cost of one individual volume.  I basically got all 3 volumes for the price of one!  Can't complain and the show is great, and my son and I love to watch it and will look forward to re-watching it at our leisure.

Overall I rate the product 4 out of 5.  Sure the packaging could have...  SHOULD HAVE been better, but the value was hard to pass up.  I would have loved to see the show released on blu-ray disc because I just really don't buy anymore DVDs.  I would have ""shel...  er, been willing to pay a little more for a blu-ray release, but I wouldn't have gotten such a deal.  So if you have not picked up any of the individual releases, then this is definitely the way to go.  If you already own the releases, you already own this, minus the over-sized slipcover.  I would have like to see a more condensed box set, because that is how I am as a collector, sleek packaging is always something I look for, and this set is a behemoth!

6492994,5,B00LN87984,"Such a great series and I am so glad that they came out with a cheaper way to get the series. Buying all those single releases is way too expensive. This series is great, Mikey is my favorite and always has been. He is just hilarious. I can't wait to actually own this and rewatch from start to finish. The villains in this series are so unique to the series. April being in school is a different turn on the character. I also enjoy the Krang.

This doesn't need a Blu ray release. It's an action packed cartoon not a high def movie. Not everything needs to be released in Blu Ray, not to mention Blu ray costs more. This show is generally meant for kids so why do kids need a Blu Ray of a cartoon. It's just practical to release a DVD set not a Blu Ray set and more cost effective. Blu Rays would be warming the shelves where the DVDs would be gone.",1412640000,,850,4.089820359281437
6492995,5,B00LN87984,"What the fudge? A reviewer giving this a 1-star just because there is no blu-ray edition? Will you please give the show its deserved merit? You are reviewing the show, not the format. A lot of movies and TV series release dvd-only editions until the movie/TV companies know there is a substantial market. It takes 4 to 5 times the cost of dvd production to produce a bluray equivalent: from re-enhancing of images to the actual production of the hardware in Mexico or China.

The show is dubbed as the best franchise ever, beating even Michael Bay's recent film adaptation. There is more character development than the original show in 1987. In the original series, Shredder was Splinter's student who wanted to take over the foot ninjas. In this franchise, they were best friends who were torn apart by jealousy over a girl. The ninjas are patterned over today's teenagers and are more realistic in terms of character development. April O'Neil is also a high-school student now versus a middle-aged news reporter in the 80s.
What stands out in this franchise is the incorporation of anime-like elements. Heads become bigger, eyes become white and large, and exaggerated sweat drops come out in response to high-emotional response, just like japanese cartoons. And this appeals to cosplay-loving generation.

It is also unfair for mature audiences to give a negative review (read other reviews) over this franchise was created for audiences 16 years old and below. They are like those mature reviewers of the movie Frozen giving it 1 star just because they think 1960s Cinderella was far better. My 3-year old son loves this and it appeals to him. There is no blood or gore and the fight scenes are not violent.

So before giving bad reviews over technicalities and not on the show's merits, know first that there are people who handle such problems. I think they are called ""customer service representatives"". (Wink, wink!)",1412553600,5,1924,4.95046439628483
