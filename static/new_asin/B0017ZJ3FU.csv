8267899,5,B0017ZJ3FU,"Tony MacAlpine is arguably one of the most inspiring and under-rated guitarists of all time. Starting to play the violin, then the piano in his early childhood, as a teenager he was able to perform all pieces of Chopin's Op. 28 with ease. In this particular video, you get to learn about technique (not so much theory, actually) including many tricks and very personal licks excerpted from his early albums (like 100s of 1000s ending for instance). MacAlpine is really the kind of person that makes you wanna improve your level and play.
Out of stock for many years now ; if you have the chance to get one copy, do not hesitate. I am still impressed to see how a 20-year-old VHS can be top-notch in terms of quality compared to the cheap divx copy you can find on the web.",1387324800,,772,4.443661971830986
8267900,5,B0017ZJ3FU,"What can you say about Macalpine? The guy is a guitar master. He is amazingly diverse and creative as his albums over the years showcase. This video offers good pointers for beginners and shredders alike. He doesn't talk to you like your are 4 years old and at the same time doesn't assume you know everything already. However the exercises have some complexity to them, I don't recommend this for someone who only has a guitar for 2 months. However on the same note, this video is great for getting down some licks. What I'm saying is the exercises are a little more challenging than playing hot cross buns. Of course like anything it just takes time and practice. Those who have played guitar for awhile know what I'm talking about. I just enjoy watching Tony play, he is unbelievably smooth and creative. Hopefully one day this classic will be on dvd. For all I don't know maybe it is already? I'm sure like everything there are pirated copies in circulation. However I'm satisfied with the old school VHS. This video was worth the 20 dollars I paid. It is an hours worth of quality. I'd rank it up there with Paul Gilbert's first instructional video.",1238803200,2,1154,4.606796116504855
