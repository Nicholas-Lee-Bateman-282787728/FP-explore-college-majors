6604759,5,B00MZ3VOEG,"What a beautiful sad story of a father's struggle in finding his lost son. In times of technology, he doesn't know how to use the camera in his mobile phone. He doesn't have a single pic of his son when he goes to file the report to police station. There are so many such instances that show the struggle of a poor family for things that the rest of us take for granted. All the characters in this movie are so real! Hats off to the team and special applaud for Rajesh Tailang who plays the father - he's put his soul into the character and moves you deeply with his performance! From leaving no stones unturned to find his son, to accepting the possibility of never being able to find him, he's portrayed every emotion so beautifully!",1437436800,,735,4.333333333333333

6604764,5,B00MZ3VOEG,"During a particularly lean period, a Delhi man (Rajesh Tailang) who earns his living repairing clothes and jewelry on the street sends his adolescent son away to a distant factory.  They need the extra income, and there is an understanding he will return by Diwali.  He does not, and so begins the parents' nightmare.  The ambivalent factory head says he ran away.  One of his friends, however, believes foul play may be involved since he left his belongings behind.  The son's vanishing shines a harsh light on certain parental inadequacies on the part of the father, previously prone to complacency and distraction.  He is not sure whether his absent child is 12 or 13.  He has no photograph of him, either.  He begins a desperate search, wheeling and dealing to earn the cash required to travel around India by bus or train while also contending with a painful truth:  he released his only son into the exploitative and volatile world of child labor, and now he may never find him.  This is a strong film by Canadian writer/director Richie Mehta: involving as a mystery, persuasive as a social document, and devastating as a family drama.  It expands and enriches as it goes, leading to one of the year's most memorable and profoundly sad conclusions.  The on-location, on-the-fly photography is electrifying:  a colorful, nervous, whirlwind, and highly detailed visual portrait of marginalized urban life in the world's second most populous country.",1417737600,3,1453,5.004166666666666

8675371,5,B00MZ3VOEG,"Realistic and haunting depiction of a poor family grappling with with the abrupt disappearance of their twelve-year son.  Excellent portrayal of familial and personal tensions and struggles.  Be warned however, expectedly, this is not light-hearted fare.",1501718400,,254,6.027777777777778
8675372,4,B00MZ3VOEG,"Beautifully paced and directed, with theme music perfect for the story. The acting is subtle and natural, congruent with the way that emotions are not overtly expressed in Indian culture. It's a story worth telling, mostly to give a voice to the plight of the poor, which anywhere in the world renders them powerless even over the most important and devastating events of their lives. A person of any means would never have ended up in this situation- and if they had, would have had the resources and connections to find the missing son. Here, a father does his best to rectify a terrible mistake-- but one made out of desperation, innocent enough to hope for the best and put his faith in people that he didn't know.

Child exploitation in 2017 is no better than it was 100, or even 200 or 300, years ago. It just hides in the shadows now, and affects only the most vulnerable. As humanity progresses onward with amazing feats of technology and development, we still have not figured out how- or perhaps cared enough- to take care of each other. I watched this film because people need to see this, not because I expected to be entertained. A beautful heartbreak and call toward evolving ourselves as human BEINGS in society, not just human doings.",1500163200,,1250,4.656108597285068
8675373,4,B00MZ3VOEG,"Siddharth, a powerful drama about working-class life in India, opens with a heartwarming scene:The protagonist, New Delhi handyman Mahendra (Rajesh Tailang), gently waves goodbye to his 12-year-old son, Siddharth, after putting him on a bus for a monthlong sojourn far away.

Is Siddhu, as everyone calls the precocious cricket fanatic, going to a sports camp? Is he staying at the seashore with cousins?

Afraid not. The boy is headed 325 miles away to a trolley factory in Ludhiana, where he'll work full-time and live in a dorm with other teen laborers.

Mahendra is a chain-wallah, someone who walks door to door offering to fix zippers. Business has been slow, and he really needs the extra income his son can bring in.

As he tells Siddhu on the phone, the entire family is proud of the boy for his sacrifice.

Mahendra, wife Suman (Tannishtha Chatterjee), and their girl, Pinky (Khushi Mathur), wait in vain in their windowless, one-room cinder-block home for Siddhu to return. He never does.

The police treat the disappearance as an abduction, telling Siddhu's parents that hundreds of kids regularly are sold into forced labor, used as sex workers, or killed for organ harvesting.

Cowritten and directed by Canadian Richie Mehta (Amal), Siddharth is a spare, lean, and decidedly unsettling account of the ugly reality of child labor and child abduction in India.

It's a real film about a real problem: No Liam Neeson-like hero arrives, guns blazing, to help his abducted child. Nor is the film filled with endless weeping, therapeutic navel-gazing, and soppy, wall-to-wall strings and piano.

Mehta's no-nonsense verite style makes the film all the more shattering. So does his ability to present characters who have complex, conflicting moralities. Mahendra, for one, is neither all good nor all bad for sending his little boy to work.

Chided by a cop for breaking India's child labor laws, he forcefully announces, ""Why would I have a son, if not to work him?""

Yet it's clear the man deeply loves his son and would do anything for him.

So he spends the rest of the film looking for his beloved boy, traveling hundreds of miles to track down the most tenuous clues. The stories of the lost children he meets on his travels - runaways, laborers, sex workers - will break your heart.",1474588800,,2297,4.937662337662338
