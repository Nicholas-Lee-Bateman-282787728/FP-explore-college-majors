8052741,1,B0007WFUTM,"If I could leave this set of movies less than one star I would.  I could not even watch Cybernator for more than a couple of minutes it was so poorly acted.  It was like a high school production with porn stars.  I bought this set of movies to watch  ""The Digital Prophet""  .  This was one movie that I did not like Jeffrey Combs in.  It is perhaps his second worst movie.",1404345600,,372,4.013698630136986
