1668056,3,B00005UV33,Ray winston plays a retired thief living a nice life under the son. That is untill Ray Logan(Ben Kingsley)pays a visit to pursway winston into one last job. Winstons stands to decline his offer and off we go with some good performances between characters with neither of the two willing to give into another. The accent of the characters made it sometimes hard to understand. The music stands out well and the picture quality is good. Overall its an o.k. film not quite as good as Locked cocked...or The LIMEY,1016409600,3,509,4.666666666666667
1668057,4,B00005UV33,"When I first heard about this film in a local newspaper I thought to my self, 'How could Ben Kingsley be scary?' Although a good question when I saw the movie I saw that he was one of the most frightening charactors I have ever seen. Kingsley plays Don Logan a phycotic gangster who goes to Spain to pull Ray Winstone (a retiered gangster) out for one last job. He dose not want to but finds that saying no to Logan is even more scary that a rock crashing into you'r swimming pool (see the movie and you will understand).  The acting is first rate and Kingsley recieved a much deserved Oscar nomination for his role. The movie sags at the end slightly but it can be forgivin.",1016323200,,675,4.2734375
1668058,4,B00005UV33,"`Sexy Beast' shares the same plot premise as David Mamet's ""Heist"", also released in 2001 - a retired thief is lured into doing one more job. This British film, though, is a different animal. Both dark and comic, director Jonathan Glazer's first movie is highly energetic and has both style and substance.
Gal [Ray Winstone], along with his ex-porn star wife, Deedee [Amanda Redman] has happily retired to a villa above the glorious Costa del Sol in Spain. Back in dreary old London, gangster Teddy [Ian McShane] needs his services for a bizarre robbery plan sends Don Logan [Ben Kingsley] to convince him. Completely mad and with all the warmth of a pit bull, he's a hard man to refuse. Caught between a rock and a hard place, Gal plays along. Or does he?
Kingsley is brilliant, and it's hard to believe this is the same gentle guy who played Gandhi. He's deservedly been nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Highly recommended for fans of film noir.",1016064000,2,959,4.714285714285714
1668059,5,B00005UV33,"This one passed UK cinemas by VERY quickly, getting some fine reviews, but no audience. I read a bit about it, then rented it when it came out. I was totally floored, even though i expected it to be good, it blew me away. I had to rent it again a couple of days later to show my friends. Then a couple of days later again. I have bought the film 3 times on DVD, as i keep giving mine away to try and spread the word about this amazing film. It's best not to know too much, just check it out.

The acting is amazing (Ben Kingsley rocks!), the director and DP are a genius team, the story is great and the sets and locations are beautiful. This is a movie to both study and enjoy if you are involved in the entertainment business. If you're not, just have fun and enjoy, and hopefully you'll be able to see what makes this movie such a masterpiece.",1013472000,,423,4.5064935064935066
1668061,5,B00005UV33,"There's a line in a Monty Python sketch about the effect a criminal has on his underlings: ""I've seen men pull their own heads off rather than see Doug."" That's the effect the news that Don Logan is coming to town has on retired criminal Gal. Gal's settled into his relaxing, lazy days under the Spanish sun, until a boulder the size of a small house flies over his head and rolls into his treasured swimming pool. Can you say ""symbolic foreshadowing,"" boys and girls?...because Don Logan's about to slam into Gal's leisurely life with all the force and violence of a landslide, sent to recruit Gal out of retirement for one last heist, and absolutely NOT taking ""no"" for an answer .
In a movie where much of the first half consists of conflict through dialogue (it's almost a stage play in set-up), the performances are key, and ""Sexy Beast"" has no weak links. Ray Winstone has the unenviable task of holding his own against Ben Kingsley, and succeeds uncannily without resorting to caricature. His fear is palpable--you can almost smell the sweat at his being cornered like a rabbit with no way to break out. Even perennial TV guest star Ian McShane excels in the role of a slick and cunning criminal boss, a performance that breaks out of his usual pattern and won't remind you in the least of Lovejoy (McShane's most famous character, the genial art forger/detective).
But the standout performance is, of course, Ben Kingsley. Kingsley is brilliant as the manic, menacing Logan: fulfills the standard clich of performing ""a role that will surprise you""-Don Logan is sort of role Michael Caine made an icon in 1960s movies like the original ""Get Carter""-tough, brutal, smooth, sexy, manipulative, and more than a little bit of a maniac: a man you don't say ""no"" to if you want to survive. The whole movie, in fact, has the feel of a 1960s British crime drama like ""Get Carter"" with the modern sensibilities of directors of today like Guy Ritchie. The movie may be a little too much a crime-genre film to garner Academy Award nominations, but both Kingsley's and Winstone's performances are worthy of an Oscar nod as a driven hunter and his prey.
Although once it gets to the heist itself, innovative as it is, the main drive of the film is lessened. Once Kingsley's off the screen, I began fidgeting, waiting for his return, and McShane's character matching wits with Gal is no substitute for vicious Don Logan. But that's the sole weak spot in an exceptionally powerful, dark-humored, violent but stylish movie that's not so much a heist caper as it is a sharp and penetrating look at the violence men visit on each other...and on themselves.",1010707200,21,2646,4.729437229437229
1668151,5,B00005UV33,"This is a good, solid British gangster film, with three great actors who do their best (or worst, depending of point of view). Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

Beowulf is a very happy man. Retired in Spain after all his tribulations, financially comfortable (""I don't have much money - but enough"") he lives a carefree existence with a former porn star, now also retired ""but whose fan club still gathers every Friday evening"". His happiness is however greatly disturbed when his old pal Gandhi arrives. Gandhi is a vicious, violent, cruel, manipulative, oversexed, foul mouthed psychopath, haunted by demons called Ego, Attitude, Prejudice and Blasphemy. He has also horrible toilet manners.

Gandhi is however only the messenger, send by Captain Blackbeard, a ferocious character who doesn's sail the seven seas anymore but rather haunts the upper class secret refuges. He is a non-nonsense guy, who puts his back (and significantly more) into his living, suffers no fool, carries no change, doesn't take no for an answer and NEVER leaves loose ends. He is currently preparing a daring criminal endeavour which involves indeed navigation, although mostly in brown water (pun very much intentional) rather than of oceanic nature. And he is calling Beowulf to him, to be part of his crew...

Trapped between Gandhi and Captain Blackbeard, poor Beowulf will find himself in a pickle and it will be one hell of a ride to crawl out of it. In fact it is not even certain if he will be able to ever come back to his beloved Spain, join his old friends, sizzle near the renovated swimming pool and eat calamaris with his lascivious former porn star... It is in fact quite possible that Captain Blackbeard will have him walk the plank - after getting his bowels for garters...

I liked this film a lot. All actors did a great job but even if Ray Winstone and Ian McShane are great it is Krishna Pandit Bhanji, a.k.a. Sir Ben Kingsley, who completely steals the show in this one - he is INCREDIBLE! Just a fair warning - the language used in this film is so strong that it can kill plants in your living room as surely as ""Agent Orange"". It certainly shocked my chipmunks - they didn't talk to me since we watched this movie (they can see the TV set from their cage).

Bottom line - a great moment of cinema. To buy, watch and keep! Enjoy!",1385424000,,2350,4.694174757281553
1668152,5,B00005UV33,"Is Ben Kingsley the world's greatest actor?  Watch this film & hold your breath.  I will take his performance with me to the grave.

1668155,5,B00005UV33,"I am a fan of Ray Winstone. But in this film it is two things which snatch the prize and throttle the life out of this just being another Brit crim flick. It is the character of Don Logan played by Ben Kingsley and the script. I am prone to sometimes compare pieces of cinematic dialogue to being Shakespearean. A lot of Kurosawa for example. Well, this is worth the comparison. Why, because the film pottles round until slow burn Kingsley starts to take off. Then, it appears there is no word not needed. In comedy with sheer psychopathic horror, it matches anything in Othello (Iago on steroids) or Richard III combined with the Krays. Winstone's role seems to be that of anchor to the terrifying force unleashed around him. In unlocking what might be termed evil in a human being Kingsley's portrayal of Don Logan is close and uncomfortable. There are laughs in this film and I laughed at some of the dialogue and interactions, but at what and on reflection what does it tell me about myself and my reactions and responses to horror/inhumanity, someone who is loathsome? At the end it left me scoured and wanting to read a copy of the script. Silence of the Lambs it is not, more a journey into increasing darkness where the soul is left behind to howl.",1350604800,2,1256,4.537444933920705

It is a stylish, fun movie with notable performances and gangster drama...It paints a pretty picture of a cool, retired guy in love and what he has to deal with because of a jack@ss he used to know in the thieving business...

Unique elements to this movie; worth watching at least once. :) I personally didn't find the material too cliche or overdone... but that's just me...I enjoyed it. :P

Actual rating is 3.5.. but for Amazon, I'll tip it to a 4 instead of a 3 due to overzealous crabs tossing out 1 stars.",1348963200,,564,4.413461538461538

The movie is 90 minutes and (spoiler next line)
the first hour is just the mafia guy showing up, sticking around and trying to get the guy to go do the heist job.  An HOUR just on that ?  I started fast forwarding through some bits because I started to think the whole movie was like that.  The heist itself takes up 5-10min of the whole movie.  You get about an hour of ""you will do it !"", ""no  I won't"", ""you will!"", ""no I won't"".  Not for my tastes, disappointing.",1325030400,,532,4.0673076923076925
1668159,4,B00005UV33,"Your jaw will be on the floor upon viewing this facet of Ben Kingsley's acting.  I had not known he was capable of this.  A friend suggested this to me, claiming that I would find his performance haunting, and he was right.

One thing that I felt was an unfortunate bit of misdirection on the director's part was the whole boulder thing at the beginning.  I had assumed that there were someone stalking the man's residence, as payback for something in the past, and that the Spanish kid was somehow complicit.  Did you get that feeling?

What I should have been focusing on was Kingsley!  BTW, he supposedly based this role on his grandmother, whom he has said was ""an extremely unpleasant woman."")

His performance was so incredible, so disturbing, it could have carried the movie by itself.  All that business with the rabbit-headed man was a waste of screen time.  From the minute Logan appears on the screen, you want to know more and more about him, and press deeper and deeper into how he became the way he is and where he wants to go in life.

Unfortunately, the director didn't give us much of that.  Just some rabbit-headed dude running around and a red-herring boulder in the pool.  What a waste.",1316390400,,1206,4.579439252336448
1668160,2,B00005UV33,"I bought Sexy Beast years ago and just put it on the shelf waiting for the right time to watch it.  Yesterday, after buying another movie from the writers, 44 Inch Chest, and reading that Ben Kingsley's performance is one of the 5 time best mobsters in film, I decided I had to watch it.

I didn't really like it at all for a couple of reasons:

1)  I couldn't understand the characters' dialogue.  And this is because I am used to the American accent.  Nothing against British accents at all, but I just have trouble understanding them when spoken too quickly and in lower tones.  I had no problem understanding Kingsley though, cause he was always yelling... or talking in a menacingly slower voice, as he does on the airplane (great scene).

2)  What was that dream sequence crap?  I immediately thought of Donnie Darko and the rabbit/man thing that showed up throughout that film.  There was no purpose for it here.

3)  And the job that the main character didn't want to do...  I thought it would be something horrific, like a hit job.  Nope.  It was clean and neat, not the climax that I thought was being built up to.

If you want to watch a GREAT performance by Kingsley, this is one.  But if you want to watch a great performance by him and a great/memorable movie, watch The House of Sand and Fog.",1309737600,,1307,4.420168067226891

1668190,4,B00005UV33,"A very modern Brit-style film with plenty of swearing and bluster, SB is well worth seeing for Kingsley's tight little turn as a much-feared London gangster. Along with the typically powerful McShane, and Winstone's nicely nuanced take on a hood trying to leave it all behind as he bakes in the Spanish sun, Sir Ben ratchets this one up a couple notches.

The script and direction are both quite good, with some very nice camera work and a splashy, colorful palette. It gets rather nasty at times, but with some funny lines to leaven the tension it all plays out well, and in a crisp 87 minutes. Things pick up towards the end after a rather talky opening, and unless one can't take a large amount of f and c-bombs, plus occasional brutal violence, this is certainly worth watching.",1274745600,2,782,4.625899280575539

Though the plot isn't that interesting or original, Sexy Beast's character interplay between evil and frothing (for a change) Ben Kingsley and mild-mannered (for a change) Ray Winstone is so compelling that the movie is still worth watching; it's no gem, but it's definitely worth seeing if you want to see Gandhi let loose strings of expletives.",1233619200,,364,5.066666666666666

By comparison, Sexy Beast is a very different film from Layer Cake.  It feels perfectly European (not American) in terms of its careful, methodical pacing and gradually building tension.  I never knew what would happen next in this film, and I loved that.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  Also, the beautiful scenery at the villa on the Spanish coast was a treat for the eyes (and makes me want to retire to the Costa del Sol just like the lead character).",1230854400,3,598,4.5

1668198,5,B00005UV33,"`Sexy Beast' is just that; it possesses a savage sexuality that rivets through the audience and draws them in, never letting go.  It's not your average gangster film.  It's smart and original and thrilling.  Couple the tight script with elegant direction and a marvelous cast, that includes two brilliant performances by the male leads (Kingsley and Winstone sizzle), and you have one of the finest films of 2001.  It's hard to find a single flaw within this breathtaking film; so why bother looking.  Let's focus on everything it has going for it.

The film follows a retired British gangster, Gary `Gal' Dove, as he tries his hardest to resist the temptation to reenter the game.  He's visited at his home in Costa del Sol by notorious mobster Don Logan who forcefully attempts to persuade him to jump back in for one more heist.  Gal refuses but like I said, Don is very `forceful' in his persuasion.

The greatest facet of this film is the pitting of Ray Winstone (who is quite the sexy beast if I do say so myself) and Ben Kingsley against one another.  Their masterful performances elevate this film into that `must-see/must-love' territory.  Winstone plays Gal with such emotional connection that you can feel his soul stripping as he contemplates the consequences of his actions.  I have been a fan of Winstone's for a while now and with each performance I fall deeper and deeper into his trance.  He says so much with his eyes, with his face; he becomes a canvas of unrelenting emotion.  Kingsley is the polar opposite of Winstone here, splicing the screen with ravaging brutality.  His character has been described as a pit-bull, and that is a very astute observation.  There is a scene where he converses with himself in the bathroom mirror; that scene alone is a spark of genius.

Amanda Redman is flawless as Gal's wife Deedee and Ian McShane is marvelous as Teddy Bass.  They support the two powerhouse performances of their co-stars with fervor and grace.

The film is magnificently constructed.  It's tight and smart and effective at what it's looking to do.  Jonathan Glazer knows what he's doing and delivers a near flawless film.  It is savage and brutal and elegant in all the right places.  It's sexy, it's provocative and it's a total beast.

In the words of Gal himself; ""It's bloody hot!""",1208390400,3,2312,4.78030303030303
1668227,5,B00005UV33,"These words, ""I won't let you be happy, why should I?"" are spoken by ""Don Logan,"" homicidal, sociopathic enforcer for London Mob boss ""Teddy Bass,"" AKA, ""The Man With The Plan."" Logan is the central protagonist in ""Sexy Beast,"" to ""Gary 'Gal' Dove,"" a comfortably retired blagger - bank robber - living in Spain with his wife, and ex-porn star, ""Deedee."" When not hanging 'round the pool of their villa, Gal and Deedee spend time in bars and restaurants with another couple, ""Aitch"" - as in the letter ""H"" - and ""Jackie."" Aitch is another ex-blagger spending his twilight years soaking up the Spanish sun and living the good life... such as it is.

Gal may be an ex-criminal, a safecracker by specialty, but he's paid the price for one job too many, done his time inside, and he's good people. You can see that by the way he jokes around with the couples pool boy, ""ordering"" him to clean-up the place while he, Gal, lays around on his lounger, bemoaning the current state of ""Dear Old Blighty"" and its people, in a somewhat forthright, expletive laden manner! LOL!

The plot of Sexy Beast is as brutally straightforward as is its protagonists. Bass has worked out how to knock-off the most lucrative, most secure vault in London, outside of the Bank of England, and he wants - doesn't necessarily ""need"" mind you, but for his own reasons wants - Gal in on the job. Gal, as we know, is retired, unfortunately for him he's definitely wanted, and Don is dispatched to bring him back... one way or another.

The first time we hear about Don is when Gal, Deedee, Aitch, and Jackie, sitting in their favorite restaurant, discuss the phone call Jackie received from London letting her know he'd be flying out to see them shortly. Like ""Kaiser Soeze"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Usual-Suspects/dp/B00005V9HH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Usual Suspects</a>, Don is a character of fearsome, almost mythic reputation, but unlike Soeze, there's no doubting the existence of Don; a real-life bogeyman, monster, psychopath, capable of acts of the most extreme violence in return for little or no provocation. As the foursome sit 'round their table, appetites suddenly gone, their hushed and plainly frightened tones tell us all we really need to know about Don Logan.

Next we see Logan being driven out to Gal's villa from the airport by Aitch and Jackie. They ride in silence, Don looks out the window at the passing countryside with the dead, emotionless eyes of a shark; Aitch and Jackie make sure they give Don no reason to talk to them. They pull up outside the villa, Gal nervously comes out to greet his unwelcome visitor, but Don is not happy, he doesn't like the heat, he's sweating, and he announces his displeasure to those present with a stream of profanity laced invective that would make a drunken sailor blush! (I watched this with a friend a while back, and his reaction to this scene was classic, the shocked look on his face said it all; ""WHAT?!?!?! This is the guy who won an Oscar playing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gandhi/dp/B000KX0IOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gandhi</a>?!?!?!"" LOL!)

The film has a wonderful ensemble cast, but is dominated, and rightly so, by Ben Kingsley's terrifying, murderously savage portrayal of Don Logan, perfectly described in the Amazon Editorial above as, ""human nitroglycerine;"" everyone around him avoids making eye contact, as if he was a rabid dog. Ray Winston, as Gal, gives another one of his seemingly effortless performances of an ordinary bloke - no saint, but not ""bad"" either - who you'd buy a pint for if you met him down the pub. And a special mention must go to Ian MacShane as the mobster Bass, all hooded reptilian eyes and blank face, who's act of coldly executed murder towards the end of the film is just as shocking as Logan's frequent outbursts of hysterical violence. Kudos also to Amanda Redmond as DeeDee, Cavan Kendal as Aitch, and Julianne White as Jackie.

Sexy Beast comes from a long line of venerable British gangster films such as Michael Caine's original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Carter/dp/0790750716/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Carter</a>, and the incendiary debut of Bob Hoskins in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Long-Good-Friday/dp/B000EDWLNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Long Good Friday</a>. So be warned, there's a rawness, and an in-your-face brutality about the film that you don't find in most US movies, especially in the script, the one exception I can think of at the moment is the NC17 version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bad-Lieutenant/dp/B00005OM6L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bad Lieutenant</a>.

1668232,2,B00005UV33,"I'm late coming to this one, but after seeing the highly positive reviews, I just had to chime in.

Ben Kingsley is awe-inspiring as Don Logan, the presumed sexy beast of the title, who has come to Spain to demand that a retired thief come back for one more job.  As the commercial review pointed out, this is about as far away from Ghandi as you could get.

Other than Mr. Kingsley's performance, I just didn't find much there, there.

Ian McShane inhabits his character with a mostly silent menace.  He's the closest thing I've ever seen to Richard Stark's Parker character, other than Lee Marvin in ""Point Blank.""  He just doesn't have much to do or to say here.

My apologies to Ray Winstone, but, as the retired thief, he seems to drift through this picture by means of grunts and facial tics.  I don't really know his work, but I hope this isn't his best.  His character, with his wife's serious help, manages to put down the sexy beast -- but then he goes and does the job anyway.

And the job, the burglarizing of a safe-deposit vault company by drilling in through a turkish bath next door, is bizarre.  I started to wonder if I was still watching the same movie.

Just as the old TV Dragnet series had its distinctive beat, and just as Roger Miller's songs had their own England Swings Like a Pendulum Do fractured meter - so ""Sexy Beast"" rides along on a kind of poetry slam staccato. Ray Winstone sets the pace in his opening monologue, where he basks in his and his wife's lucky, luxurious life on the Mediterranean. ""Simply Fabadocious.""

This is only the second movie I can remember seeing in which a wealthy couple lives in pure, harmless delight in their wealth. (The other movie was ""Six Degrees of Separation."") In most other movies, the wealthy are automatically depicted as being either unhappy, villainous, or both. But here we have people we immediately like. And when Ben Kingsley darkens their door, threatening to destroy their lives, we root for them to be able to maintain their happy, reveling existence.

It's not completely clear how the Kingsley character can wield such power over people, causing them to quake at the mere mention of his name. However Kingsley does create plausible menace with his driving intensity. He ups the volume of negative vibe with his pounding, punctuated, ""No, No, No!""

It's Ian McShane though who is the most truly menacing character here. The dark, raw threat of brutality about him creates almost overwhelming tension at some points. One might ordinarily expect that he would be ""the sexy beast"" of the movie, rather than Kingsley.

However, it is the nature of this film to be syncopated throughout. None of its stressed beats fall quite where you expect them to fall.

I knew he was a good actor from Schindlers List and Ghandi but this is something completely different. Its one of the best portrayals of a hard-man you'll ever see. The other surprise for me was the performance of Ian McShane who is utterly convincing as the crime boss behind the scenes. Almost as terrifying as kingsley's performance.

Sporting brilliant performances by Oscar winner (and nominee for this film) Ben Kingsley as well as one of my favorite actors Ray Winstone (so amazing when he plays the vulnerable tough guy, refined and wounded none the less), this film is full of reasons to watch and love what you see.

As gangster Don Logan, Kingsley is viscous and unrefined, charismatic, sarcastic and ferocious and that makes him all the more magnetic as he comes to single handedly force retired British gangster Gal (Winstone) to come back in for one more job.  When Gal refuses Logan is forced to change his mind.  The outcome is one I won't spoil but just say that this is a must see for any fan of gangster films, British films or anyone in the cast and is sure to be a memorable movie experience.

Kingsley delivers as usual, and the raves he received were just as you can imagine, but it's Winstone (a true sexy beast) who really steals to show, to me at least, with his multi-layered performance that went completely overlooked by almost every critic, why I'll never know.

Nonetheless -- Ben Kingsley as the psychopathic gangster Don Logan is over-rated; his upstaging of the other actors is unnerving and annoying, but, thankfully, he doesn't completely get away with it. For Ray Winstone is perfectly cast and absolutely brilliant and so overshadows Kingsley even for viewers not quite aware of the feat, as does Ian McShane, whose genial laughter is beyond scary.

Cinematographically daring and interesting, this is a visually memorable film. It also has many surprising and subtle touches in its portrayal of character, for instance in the tender avuncular relationship between Gal and Enrique, and in the deep love that binds Gal to his ex-porn-star wife, played magnificently by Amanda Redman.

Well, let me give you guys a tip, if you like this you'll love Ray Winstone's new movie, Te Proposition.  But why did I hate and despise both of these flicks?  In part because they announce and never stop announcing that they are ""important"" films that need to be taken seriously.  They have great actors giving psychologically penetrating and important character studies. We should all aet up seminar groups forthwith to discuss them and to compare Dostoevsky vision of Rakolnikov's maniacal violence to Ben Kingsely's.  Oh balls.  It's all too much for me to take.  It's a nasty little film about gangsters with some too too hammy performances, especially by James (or is it Edward? do I care) Fox that produces a lot of violence and never justifies its use of it (recent violent film that justifies its use of violence: the Beat the my heart skipped). Casting Ray Winstone as a gangster is as tired as Ian Mcshane as a cockney.  Even Kingsley is pretty much reprising. A Fox as a toff is absurd.

1668265,5,B00005UV33,"If you like gangster flicks, especially of the Cockney 'firm' variety, then you need to see this movie. SEXY BEAST is a fantastic but underrated indie classic. Like some of the other reviewers, I could watch this movie over and over again.

Gal Dove (Ray Winstone) is a retired London mobster now living in Spain, going to fat in idyllic bliss with his former porn actress wife Dee Dee (Amanda Redman) and their best friends, a married couple they've known from when they were back in the life. Into their domestic paradise enters Don Logan (Ben Kingsley), another 'old friend,' showing up unannounced, telling Gal he has a job for him and ""No is not an answer.""

Logan is one of those small wiry guys who make up for what they lack in height and muscle with an extra dose of psychotic meanness. Crime boss Teddy Bass (excellently played with menacing reticence by Ian McShane) is planning an ambitious heist on a prestigious bank, Logan is to help assemble the crew. Logan wants Gal in on the job and, as far as he's concerned, he's already made Gal's mind up for him. For Logan it is only a matter of how little stroking he will need to do before he strikes.

In one scene, it's late and everyone is in bed, except Logan who is in the bathroom shaving. Standing in front of the mirror he starts thinking about Gal's refusal earlier in the evening. He begins muttering. Needing to relieve himself, he continues thinking and muttering as he urinates all over the floor. By now, having worked himself up into a rage, he runs out the bathroom with shaving cream still on his face, down the hall and, screaming ""No! No! No!"" storms into Gal and Dee Dee's bedroom kicking and punching the poor man out of his own bed.

Another scene in the movie shows Logan sitting on a plane which will soon depart. Thinking nothing of consideration for fellow passengers, or rules and regulations, he lights up a cigarette. When one of the passengers mildly protests, Logan calmly but coldly informs the man that if he must put out the cigarette, he will be putting it out on him. When a flight attendant intervenes, Logan gets up, grabs his bag and --after telling all onboard he hopes the plane crashes and they all die-- demands to get off. After being removed and brought to airport security, Logan explains to the security officer the incident was all a case of nerves. He concocts a tale about a male flight attendant groping him while boarding! With a straight face, he tells the man that he felt violated and was literally in shock, not even realizing he was smoking a cigarette! Of course, he doesn't wish to make a fuss about any of it and would just like to leave and forget the whole thing.

He walks out the airport, right into a taxi and back to making Gal's life hell. I couldn't stop laughing!

Ben Kingsley does for SEXY BEAST what Joe Pesci did for GOODFELLAS. Both portray sociopaths, incapable of true consideration and comapassion. The way they selfishly crash through life is so disturbing it's comes off comical.

Not giving too much of the story away, but Gal does return to London to do the job. However, not for the reasons you might think. Instead, something occurs which makes Gal feel it necessary to get to London, complete the job and return to Spain quickly as possible.

Ben Kingsley is one of the most menacing villians to ever grace the screen and like nothing you have ever seen before. And the funny thing is Ian McShane is equally as menacing and evil as Teddy Bass in a totally different way. The story is great and the dialogue is at times hilarious but also emotional, intelligent and sometimes scarey. This is one movie I can watch over and over and with the surround sound on the musical score and soundtrack is awesome. I recommend this movie to anybody and everybody.

Ben Kingsley's performance is riveting, and, as someone said earlier, is so different from the parts he usually plays.  His performance as the rage filled mobster, Don with his obsession with getting the retired mobster, ""Gal"" to do ""one more job"" and the things he does and says to ""persuade"" him are like a series of hammer blows.

The other surprising performance, at least to me, is that of Ian McShane as mob boss, Teddie Bass, the Prince of Darkness.  After seeing McShane's Teddy in action, I wouldn't have wanted to go back to London and tell him ""Gal"" said ""no"" either.  I have been familiar with McShane's work for the past forty years.  He has always been a very capable actor delivering good performances consistently  However, he always played light comedic roles.  I was very surprised when he was chosen to play another Prince of Darkness, Swearningen in HBO's ""Deadwood.  I wonder if it might have been this performance as Teddie which caused him to be chosen for the Deadwood role.

Ray Winstone gives his usual excellent performance as the retired safe cracker, afraid of the damage Don can do to his family and friends if he refuses to join the ""job"" but not wanting to do the one more job which could land him in prison long enough for it to be a life sentence.

The story is intriguing; the performances are amazing.  This is a must see movie for all noir mystery fans.

One retired gangster is forced into a  hold up  of a very special type, not by the special agent coming from the boss, but by his own wife who kills the agent. The break-in works but the boss knows what must have happened to his agent, a boss who is definitely bizarre due to the killing he does after the break-in and the fact that he lets our hero go though he is not secure any more. It's the type of thriller that is concentrating on the completely psychotic psychology modern gangsters have who live against the law and yet live by a law that is even stricter than the one they break. But, all in all, that's slightly easy and I just wonder if the main interest of the film is not the four letter words the agent uses in abundance.

He says in the commentary that one of the young sassy actors was very respectful to him -- and to no one else in the cast.  But Ben, you have BECOME a world-class blood-thirsty psycho.

1668281,5,B00005UV33,"Gary ""Gal"" Dove has found bliss in retirement; Nirvana in the sun-drenched blistering heat of the Costa Del Sol, Spain. His hillside villa is a billion miles away from his old life: safe-cracker and thug in gloomy old England.

Within seconds of landing into the arid, teeming battleground of ""Sexy Beast"", we see Gal Dove (Ray Winstone, ying to Ben Kingsley's yang---see below) supine, 250 pounds of Yorkshire fat, happily simmered and broiled, and long-relaxed muscle, happily slack upon his lounger, baking by the pool.

Happy. Reflective. Content.

He lumbers up from his lounge-chair, snug in a Euro nad-hugger speedo (as only a happy man can carry off without shame), and starts to launch his portly bulk into the pool. Seconds before he does, a boulder, tumbling from the Andalusian heights, thunders inches away from him into the pool.

That's what they call Foreshadowing.

The boulder, of course, is the Emissary of the Devil, already on its way to Gal Dove's retreat. The Name of this particular Devil is Don Logan (Ben Kingsley, the very incarnation of Rage and the movie's black heart), and he does Hell a credit. Stop the tape a second. Don Logan shows up at Dove's Spanish villa, maybe hours after the boulder pays its respects to Gal's swimming pool.

Logan is preceded by the Dread Black Spectre of his Reputation: everybody Dove knows---his wife and former porn star DeeDee (Amanda Redman), his hapless gin-drenched mate Harry (James Fox), Harry's wife Jackie Julianne White)---all of them know Logan. His wrath is legendary.

Sometimes, God knows, it's hard to say ""no"" to Don Logan.

Now: you see this flick for three reaons: 1) Ben Kingsley 2) Ben Kingsley 3) Ben Kingsley. When Kingsley's off the screen, frankly, you can turn off the DVD and go to sleep. Well, you'll wanna find out what happens, but Kingsley, one of the greatest actors of any age and doubly admirable, in my estimation, because he takes work whenever he can get it (from ""Gandhi"" to ""Species"", from ""Schindler's List"" to ""Bloodrayne""---some sneer, I respect)---Kingsley electrifies.

He owns ""Sexy Beast"", consumes it, dominates it with his legend before he enters the picture, stuns, terrifies, brutalizes, bullies his way into sheer and complete hegemony over every living soul on or off the screen when he's in the picture. Don Logan rules, and Kingsley brings him to life: this skinny, wiry, muscular, tattooed, aggressively in-your-face bald, snapping, hyper-kinetic little creature of hate and hell and fury.

He runs ""Sexy Beast"", he owns this movie: and---he demands---on the part of his crime boss---that Dove return to the world of crime and hate and potential prison time for ONE LAST HEIST.

You've heard that before? Good. Dove doesn't wanna go. Who would blame him? He's happy, for once in his life, and he's relatively safe. I lived for a while in Andalusia; I knew men like Gal Dove. Dove drinks. He lounges. He soaks up rays. He's plump, flabby, soft. You think he can stand up to Logan, the very incarnation of the blood-soaked and hungry-for-more avatar of War?

You'll see. What's the butcher's bill for Paradise?

Anything more than that and I'll spoil your fun: suffice it to say that when Kingsley is on-screen, the flick is electric; absent the sneering, snapping Logan, and things drag a bit---but they're still intriguing, in a ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" kind of way. But Kingsley brings this sick little gutter masterpiece to life: he makes you flinch. He is brutal, possessive, dangerous, monstrous, insanely funny. I'd hire him, or buy him a drink, or mebbe even befriend him, but then I'm as much a monster as he is.

Truth is, Kingsley is so good, so brutal, so crackling with cruel insane energy, that he basically chews up the flick: he's like a Black Hole, draining everything else white. But it would be wrong to say the other members of the cast don't hold up: they do, in spades. You'll see. Winstone, particularly, is good; stoic, steady, oddly pathetic and noble. Ian McShane, of course, turns in a role as a mafioso sleaze. Dove, Harry, and pool-boy Enrique (the impossibly glorious Alvaro Monje) go hunting a rabbit; that same rabbit---with a few modifications and a better arsenal---returns to Gal Dove in dreams. The Hunter becomes the Hunted.

Now that's a Sexy Beast. Indeed.

1668282,5,B00005UV33,"Ben Browder, at a Farscape convention (yes, I am a huge geek), recently explained what makes a great actor:

""The doctor's coming into a room.  But he's not there yet.  Actor #1 says: Get the doctor!  Actor #2 says: The doctor will save him! Actor #3 says: Here he comes! And we know without a doubt that the person who enters the room next is a doctor, and he hasn't spoken a single word.""

Ben's point was that memorable characters are formed by interactions with other actors.  Which is why it's silly to give just one person kudos for a particular part, because all the actors who interact with that character help make that actor's character believable. And therein lies the beauty of Sexy Beast.

Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) doesn't show up for the first half of the film.  What we see instead are the straw lives of four other people that hurricane Don will blow to pieces. There's Gary ""Gal"" Dove (Ray Winstone), a big shlub with a bad tan and tight swimming trunks. He is madly in love with his attractive wife, Deedee (Amanda Redman).  They seem to spend all their time hanging out by the pool, chatting about very little of substance, with another overly tanned chap named Aitch (Cavan Kendall) and his stunner of a wife Jackie (Julianne White).

Until Don shows up.

As it turns out, what we thought were just a couple of middle-class folks living the retiree life turn out to be washed up, worn out criminals and ex-porn stars.  And unfortunately for Gal, his life has finally caught up with him in the form of Don.

Winstone and the rest do a fantastic job of exhibiting bone numbing, pee-in-your-pants fear.  They are nearly paralyzed by the thought of Don showing up and terrified of saying no to him.  Because of course Don wants poor Gal for one last job.  But Gal has good reason not to want to play along; he has enough money, a beautiful wife, and he was in prison for the last nine years.  His love of the sun, of the simple things, is understandable.

Doesn't matter though.  Don is coming to town.

When he finally shows up, Kingsley does an excellent job of making Don as horrible as we feared.  He's a psychopath of King Kong proportions; a snarling, spitting, peeing (yes, peeing) pit bull in human form that chomps on everything within reach.  The rest of the film follows the job itself, a dark tale of a crime boss (Teddy ""Black Magic"" Bass, played by Ian McShane) who wants to break into a vault to prove he's a better man.

Sexy Beast's parallels to Donnie Darko, which came out the same year, are uncanny.  Both characters begin radical when a massive object (a boulder in Sexy Beast, an airplane engine in Donnie Darko) smashes into their lives.  And both characters have a deranged man-rabbit hinting at darker things to come.

Oh, I'm sorry.  You didn't hear about the rabbit part?  A lot of reviews seem to skip it.

Scattered throughout the film (three times, to be exact) are references to an uncredited, angry rabbit in human form.  He haunts Gal's nightmares.  He represents everything that Gal is and was, and could be.  It's telling that the rabbit-man only appears after Gal and Aitch try and fail to shoot a rabbit at point blank range.  Everything goes wrong...even the rifle falls apart.  Accompanying them on their hunting trip is their hired help, a young boy who remains mute for the entire film.  He's his own rabbit and it turns out he's one of the few people willing to stand up to the scary hunter.

Indeed, if there's a moral in this film, it's that God favors the meek.  Sometimes it's because the strong don't think they're a threat.  Sometimes it's because the meek get lucky.  And sometimes, it's because the meek grab sticks and gang-beat the strong to death.

A fantastic, tightly focused film that deftly wields profanity and terrified looks with the same measured approach.  The director, Jonathan Glazer, knew what he was doing when he cast Ben Kingsley.  You'll never look at Gandhi the same way again.",1128556800,4,3964,4.596291012838802

1668285,4,B00005UV33,"Gal (Ray Winstone) and DeeDee (Amanda Redman) are living a quiet, tranquil life of retirement in Spain. Gal is perfectly content to lay out and bake in the sun all day. Gal is a retired thief and is not happy to hear that an old acquaintance, Don Logan (Ben Kingsley), is traveling from London to convince him to help out with a 'job'. Upon his arrival, Don turns heaven into hell. Gal and DeeDee have to deal with the problem.

""Sexy Beast"", the new British film from first-time director Jonathan Glazer, is a promising debut. The director, reportedly one of the most sought after commercial directors, has a cinematic eye and composes very interesting shots. He does not fall into the trap of other former commercial-directors-turned-film-directors. He doesn't edit the film excessively. Scenes play out as they probably would in real life. He allows us to get to know the characters and to see what they are doing, gives us time to get into their skin. This is very helpful and effective. During the opening scenes, of Gal sunbathing, I could feel my skin heating up.

Glazer does fall into a trap that is very common. He composes some shots in a way calculated to make them look interesting or pretty, forcing them to appear unnatural. uy Ritchie does this a lot, but his films have the feel of a cartoon and it becomes a part of the film. Glazer does some strange things with point of view which serve to pull the viewer out of the film. We see the action from the POV of a car door as it is closed, we see the action from the POV of a revolving door in a hotel as it turns, etc. POV is a tricky thing and needs to seem as though it is actually coming from someone. In these shots, no one is at this level, so the shots appear unnatural.

Also, Glazer provides too many literal images. The audience is smart and it is more effective to leave things to the imagination. A critical plot point happens near the end of the second act. Just as it is about to happen, Glazer cuts away to a new scene in London. I was very surprised. The scene was very effective, leaving the consequences of the action, the consequences that we didn't see to my imagination. I was thinking that some very bad things happened. However, the remainder of this scene is intercut with parts of the next. I no longer needed to imagine anything as everything was portrayed for me. Not as effective.

Kingsley and Winstone are the best things about the film. Kingsley is electrifying. Everything about Don is menacing. From the moment he fist appears, we get the image of a lifelong thief, a tough guy. Then Kingsley builds upon this, creating one of the most menacing characters I have seen in a long time. Every word out of his mouth is meant to hurt and harm, to cause damage.

Winstone is just the opposite. Gal is a former gangster, and we get that immediately from his character, but he i very determined to live a new life. He has a wife, whom he obviously loves dearly, and he is very happy. Don threatens this life, but he manages to maintain his cool and stick by his guns. He has a quiet, steely resolve which proves very effective throughout the film.

""Sexy Beast"" is far from a great film, but there is enough going on to keep people interested and entertained. It also makes me eagerly anticipate Glazer's next film. Perhaps he will learn from his mistakes and create something very memorable.",1113264000,,3382,4.491056910569106

Don Logan is the antithesis of the Mahatma in every way. Kingsley's  character is as vicious and unrelenting as any character I can recall. Sexy Beast centers around a ""retired"" thief (Ray Winstone) who is ""asked"" out of retirement to do one last job by his old boss Don Logan (Kingsley). The majority of the running time of the film consists of Kingsley badgering, harrassing and degrading Winstone into doing the job. Kingsley's English Cockney accent is so spot on and acerbic it's as if he's spitting venom. This film has some of the best one liners to come along in some time, all from Kingsley of course, such as:

Gal: I'm happy here, Don.
Don: I won't let you be happy, why should I?

OR

Don: You skin looks like leather...like crocodile, big fat crocodile.

OR

Passenger on airplane: Why don't you put out the cigarette?
Don: I'll put it out, provided your prepared to let me put it out on your eyeball.

AND, OF COURSE

Gal: ""I'm sorry, I'm just going to have to turn this opportunity down Don.""
Don: ""No, your just going to have to turn this opportunity YES!!""

Ian McShane rounds out this fantastic cast playing Teddy Bass, one of the most feared gangsters in all of England. McShane's deadpan glares are as scary as they come and he does a fantastic job as always. Overall, this is one of the best films I've seen in the past ten years.

Winstone still holds his own and really is the barometer of this film.  He perfectly portrays a former hood who although used to be good has become soft and does not want to go back.  He has no choice and momentarily slips back into his old skin.

Scenes to remember are these:

1) The dialogue where Kingley's recounts his learning of the heist and who is behind it.

2) The robbery scene is incredible and really a spectacular work of cinematography.

This movie is awesome and I totally recommend it.",1103673600,3,684,4.680672268907563
1668302,4,B00005UV33,"I enjoyed this film and, with only a few reservations, recommend it as a fine way to kill an evening with a the girl friend or a buddy.

One shouldn't bring presumptions and expectations along when seeing any film for the first time. Just hit play, sit back, and soak it in the first go around. Having said that, for me, the first go around felt kind of flat.

Ben Kingsley, for all the hype about his character ""Don"", doesn't present us with a two dimensional character. Don Logan isn't simply an insane antisocial tough guy but a genuinely complex emotional character study.

While the emotional payoff of the film isn't all that it could have been, it's redeemed in part by Ray Winstone's warm and endearing performance. Winstone does a superb job playing opposite the films antagonists as a truly sympathetic character.

Also, the chemistry between the four friends in the first half of the film is just marvelous, the whole supporting cast really give the film it's structure.

Ian McShane is really a sight to behold. In many ways Ian McShane's Teddy Bass character is even more frightening than Kingsley, with Teddy there are no clues as to what motivates his malevolence.

And, despite the critics, I though the dream sequences involving the anthropomorphic rabbit-man were terrific, almost the most intensely unsettling part of the film. Watch the body language of the rabbit-man, that is the sexy beast.

The cinematography is done with a light and easy touch. It's some of the best unassuming and inobtrusive dp work i've seen in a while. It has just enough flash to suite the genre without anchoring it in predictability

There certainly were moments in the film when I said to myself,""wow what a great shot"" or just loved the acting skill on display throughout the film. However, I think where the film faltered was in maintaining a consistant air of dread or tension.

Of course, without this, there can't be any real emotional payoff.

The scene upon which the film is supposed to pivot also fell somewhat short, despite my liking the scene, it wasn't presented with a solid enough feel to give it the gravitas it needed. Without the umph in this scene the second half of the movie doesn't build to anything meaningful. In spite of all of that the film is still a joy to watch.",1102032000,2,2292,4.7218045112781954

1668304,1,B00005UV33,"Why does anyone like this kind of movie?  None of the

stars are attractive, well, except in this movie a local

native teenage boy who might have been a good choice for

the protagonist, since he tries in vain to comprehend what

is going on from time to time and even attempts to get rid

of ""Don"", the Ben Kingsley character, when one has been wondering

for some time why the others put up with his histrionics and bizarre behavior, especially

since it has been clear that Don was an unwelcome houseguest from the beginning.

""Don"", ominously affiliated with deranged associates, shows

up trying to persuade the main character, an indolent retired

criminal, to participate in a heist supposedly because his

expertise is needed, even though ultimately the heist is

executed so crudely that it seems obvious that no special

skills are required, other than looking bad in a Speedo

(the heist is done from a pool in a Turkish bath next to the bank

and involves a large gang of divers and swimmers,

most of whom look like they could not carry it off).

The praise heaped on Kingsley for this ""Tony Soprano""

role is bewildering.  I guess he plays a criminal psycho

pretty well, but how hard is that?  A complex psycho,

like the character played by Kevin Kline in ""Sophie's

Choice"" is one thing.  This character is cardboard,

and he doesn't even dominate the action, such as it is,

and most of that is pretty stupid.  What he does is

splutter obscenities and illogical exhortations that

are so offensive that one again wonders why someone

doesn't decide to blow his brains out--or call the local

cops--before the kid finally picks up a gun and appears

from nowhere.

As some of the more perceptive reviewers have noted, the

dialogue in this movie is all but unintelligible.  The

motivations of the characters are illogical---why would

the lead character, nicknamed ""Gal"", a retired criminal who wants to just

enjoy life now with his wife, put up with ""Don Logan"",

the Kingsley character, showing up at his villa in Spain

and making a nuisance of himself?  When the kid finally

shows up with a gun and seems poised to kill Don, it makes

no sense unless he has been privy to more than has appeared,

and we wonder why he is the only one who takes charge.

Given the story's setting, this might have been a promising

study of how expatriates attempt to plan a crime back in

London and still manage to observe ""honor among thieves"",

and there are some wasted ambiguities here and there,

including for example the boy's relationship with ""Gal"".

The opening scene is highly suggestive of some kind of

complexity there, perhaps even some kind of sexual relationship,

and the boy-servant's loyalty and

instinctive sense of danger could well make sense and what's

more, offer an attractive character in the tradition of such

sensible and acute observers as Jim in Huckleberry Finn or

Kim in Kipling's novel.

But that, or even having one or more of the women characters

in the movie show something more than a sullen resignation to

her situation, might make for a character that one could identify

with or care about, and movies like this---and HBO's ""The Sopranos""

--are determined to avoid such old-fashioned notions

of entertainment.",1099180800,7,3268,4.776576576576576

Much of the first part of the film consists of Logan bullying Gal Dove, his wife (Amanda Redman), and friends (Cavan Kendall and Julianne White) in order to get Gal to agree to do the job.  Don disappears from the film, with no particular consequences for anyone.  The heist goes off in peremptory fashion, hardly seeming to be worth all of the build-up.  All through the film, I felt that director Jonathan Glazer and screenwriters Louis Mellis and David Scinto were setting me up for something surprising, but it never came off.

It is the later figure, the gangster Don Logan, performed by Ben Kingsley in an Oscar nominated role, that dominates every moment on screen where he either appears or simply is being talked about, but the former, Ray Winstone as ""retired"" safecracker Gary ""Gal"" Dove, is a compelling, but much more subtle, character as well.  Gal is living the good live in his villa in Spain, sunning himself by the pool, when something happens that we soon understand is clearly a warning shot from the gods.  Gal is happy in his retirement, married to the woman he loves (Amanda Redman), who happens to be a former porn star.  Then word comes than Don is on his way with a offer that Gal intends to refuse.  However, nobody says ""no"" to Don Logan.
The scenes between Gal and Don in this script by Louis Mellis and David Scinto strike me as what Harold Pinter would produce if he was writing about gangsters and went overboard on the profanity.  A conversation with Don is taking your life into your hands and Gal knows it, quietly dancing around the fatal rejection for as long as he can.  Kingsley's Don is one of the scariest men ever to appear in a film, although I am not sure how much of that has to be the sheer shock at the idea that it is ""Gandhi"" on the screen who is launching into foul-mouthed tirades and radiating danger with every look and action (all without ever having a gun in his hand, I should add).  This performance is astounding, and if it is unexpected that is only because we have taken Sir Ben for granted for a long time.  Kingsley lost the Best Supporting Actor Oscar to Jim Broadbent, who had an advantage with strong performances in ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""The Diary of Bridget Jones"" to go along with the one for which he won in ""Iris,"" but this is an unforgettable performance, assuming you get around to seeing the film.
Kingsley's performance is so overwhelming that you may well fail to notice how strong Winstone is as the film's lead.  After all, it is Gal who is the title character, but Winstone's performance is so understated that it is can be rather underwhelming, especially in the face of Kingsley's performance.  The other thing that almost gets lost is the plot, because there is something that can be gotten if only there is the will, because the way will be right behind.  The caper is just crazy enough to make sense given the proceedings and we have to keep in mind that no matter how much of a mad dog Don Logan might be, there is somebody holding his leash at the other end.  ""Sexy Beast"" is a very good film with more than one outstanding performance, but it is not going to be to everyone's taste given the violence and the profanity, although both are true to the world of these characters.",1074124800,33,2958,4.44547134935305

Ben Kingsley might be the draw, but the pay off is not only in his powerful performance of a character you really don't want coming to stay overnight.

The last person you'd ever think of pulling off such an act is Ben Kingsley.  Well, it only takes a minute or two to figure out that Kingsley can play one mean and frightening S.O.B. that could perhaps even make Joe Pesci soil himself and run home crying to Mommy.  ""Sexy Beast"" is a suspenseful, and even sometimes humorous gangster movie that is unlike any other.
Gal used to be into the life of crime, but has ever since retired to the hot surroundings of Spain.  And, he is quite happy with his life.  That is, until Don Logan (Kingsley) decides to drop by and offer him a job.  Under normal circumstances, Gal would just say ""no"" and never look back, but Don Logan is NOT your normal circumstance.  He's a violent and hot-tempered man who doesn't like to take ""no"" for an answer.  Refusing the job from Logan could mean Gal sealing his own fate.
This film was a complete surprise for me.  I had no idea what I was getting myself into and was in awe with what I was experiencing.  Ben Kingsley definitely steals the show and makes you feel cold all over with his chilling and brutal persona.  The film is not about numerous murders or killings; this movie relies more on dialogue and the psyches of its characters.  This film wouldn't be nearly as effective if it were non-stop violence galore.  Ben Kingsley is extremely frightening in his ""potential"" to do harm to others; such as Anthony Hopkins as the notorious ""Hannibal Lecter"" in ""Silence of the Lambs.""
This film may not appeal to everybody; especially those who are looking for a non-stop action extravaganza.  ""Sexy Beast"" heavily relies on dialogue and character development than on anything else.  Do not go into this movie with the expectations of seeing another ""Casino"" or ""Goodfellas.""  This is a different type of beast (pardon the pun) in the gangster genera.  The movie is short, but it doesn't overstay its welcome and gives us exactly what we need.  We may be left with the feeling of wanting more, but the overall impression is that the movie does a great job of entertaining us for 90 minutes.
The DVD has some cool extras to offer.  The picture and sound quality are not lacking in any way, shape or form.  Extras included are commentary by Kingsley and the producer, theatrical trailers, and a featurette.  While it might not be a ""fully-loaded"" DVD, it still has some entertaining features.  English Subtitles might be helpful for those who have a hard time getting used to the British accents of the characters.
""Sexy Beast"" was a complete joy to watch.  It's wild, intense, and even funny at times.  While it may not appeal to everybody, I think it's something that should definitely be checked out by others.  If you have any doubts that Ben Kingsley can play a terrifying and violent mobster, well just have a seat and pop this baby into your DVD player.

However, the best single scene in the film *doesn't* include Kingsley.  It's the part where the four main protagonists - Ray Winstone, Amanda Redman, Cavan Kendall, Julianne White - find out about Logan's impending visit.  The fear and dread on their faces, and in the words and actions, is palpable.  It's a tremendous display of acting.
Everyone who reviews this movie will talk about Kingsley and Winstone.  That's entirely justified.  But for a US viewer, discovering Amanda Redman - as Gal's wife DeeDee - is a real treat.  Finding out she's a trained Shakespearean actress convinced me of her incredible range (given that DeeDee is desribed as an ""ex-porn star"" & is the only one who rises to meet Logan's challenge).
Incidentally, Cavan Kendall - as Gal's best buddy Aitch - died shortly after filming wrapped up.  The film is dedicated to his memory.",1061769600,9,1015,5.0
1668341,4,B00005UV33,"Expectations can lead to bitter disappointments. For over two years hearing friends and acquaintances bemoan the fact that I'd yet to view "" Sexy Beast "" and Ben Kingsley's Academy Award winning take as bilious and vengeful career criminal Don Logan I, at last, was able to fully digest ths marvelous picture. And though I may not share my friends complete enthusisasm for this movie I did find it completely engaging ( with reservations! )...though not completely satisfying.
Obviously with Mr. Kingsley's role as the contemptible Mr. Logan the movie does rather revolve around a character that is neither completely fleshed out or indeed perhaps not even wholly worthy of all of this incredible word of mouth that it seems to have been awarded. Obviously Logan is a dark and disturbing ( and somewhat socially challenged ) character who pays the protagonist Gal ( lovingly underplayed by Ray Winstone ) a visit in an attempt to have him do one more job back in London for his old boss Teddy ( the ever sinister Ian McShane ). And while I found Kingsley's Don Logan to be just erratic and evil it sadly reached the point where I found him to be little more then an errant child in need of a good spanking as well. By giving Don so very much dialogue I found that, as time went by, his character became less a study of evil ( and far less threatening ) and more in a study of a lonely man who is seeking love  from a past flame and one who needs solace and empathy.  The scene on the airplane with Don heading back to London and subsequently thrown off due to his bad behavior seemed neither threatening or cruel. If anything it seemed rather contrived ( I've seen questioable behavior such as that myself while travelling ).  For this viewer Don Logan was simply far too accessible as to his insecurities ( hence his relationship with the ever attractive Jackie ) and on the screen far too much thus taking away some of the mystery as to why he was supposedly so intimidating. Mean-spirited yes but it seemed as though the film was trying far too hard to make him seem as though he was the epitomie of some dark and forboding presence. For me, after a while he was little more then a nuisance and I was glad to see our protagonist off to London to do the heist.
That being said, I did find Ian McShane as Teddy the crime boss to be of a particularly dominating presence and the one role where you simply did not know what he was going to do next. At once he was not only deeply threatening but oddly devoid of possessing any true emotions. The scene with Teddy driving Gal back to the airport, for this viewer, was one that frightenly real simply because you never knew what Teddy might do, or say, next. For me, Ian McShane almost stole this film and without him the movie wouldn't carry half the weight that it does so well. To be completely honest I felt that Ian McShane could say more with just one look then Don Logan did in one of his tyrants that the films protagonists are subjected to. The role of Teddy was so forboding and oddly entrancing simply due to the fact that here was a man who, unlike our talkative Mr. Logan, didn't say much ( thus not giving away too much of his character ) but seemed to constantly be taking everything in and you half expected him to erupt in a blind rage at any moment. With a ruthlessness and sheer abandonment that no other character was capable off. And it was all imaginatively done with extreme subtlty and aplomb thus showing the viewer how terribly banal evil can at once be.
Overall, this was a film that while I enjoyed very much but, as previously stated, with some reservations. The murder at the end of the movie seemed rather pointless, though it seemed to be thrown in for little more then for effect not because it helped along the story line. Though I did find the murder at the house in Spain to be particularly ruthless ( and graphic ) though necessary to the films emtional impact and was not only well done but perhaps was the most honest scene in the entire film. Overall, a interesting twist on in the gangster genre ( and dramatically more honest then what we see made over here in America ) and one which should be seen more then once. If nothing else to enjoy the final scene which comes as not so quite a shock but shows a sense of grisly humour that ends the movie on a high note. You be the judge!",1056326400,2,4370,4.392592592592592
1668342,5,B00005UV33,"""Sexy Beast"" opens on a scene of simple, Hockney-like geometry.  A square pool.  A horizontal white plinth of lounge chair.  A male body, roughly rectangular.  Many shades of blue.  The establishing shot marvels at a near-African sun.
Two overlapping pink hearts, candy-shaped, feature in mosaic at the bottom of the perfect blue pool.  These are the kind of hearts that, like tiki torches and umbrella-laden drinks, suddenly look agreeable, even touching, and so deeply right in a tropical setting.  Totally tasteless and totally sincere.  No impoverished labourers created that mosaic, no: those hearts are made of pure love.
The body looks edible, tenderized, like a slab of medium-rare steak.  The slicked-back hair is a glorious honey blond, striped with white.  The body is doughy and middle-aged but still lushly beautiful, tanned the ridiculous mahogany of vacationing Englishmen.  It is covered only with tiny yellow Speedo briefs.  The body can barely rouse itself to deliver a rapturous monologue on its pleasures.
Sun, semi-nudity, solitude.  It's all right there on the surface.  A vision of calming hedonism, of gorgeousness in exile on the Costa del Sol. The souped-up reggae of ""Peaches"" by the Stranglers is a perfect, cheerily insinuating soundtrack.
Gal Dove, retired Cockney gang member and burglar, is enjoying an eternal poolside junket in a world without melanoma.  Reflecting on a former life in England, he mutters: ""It's a dump.  Don't make me laugh.  What a toilet.""
Gal clambers up from his white sun bed to appreciate his existence from a rare perspective of verticality.  Suddenly, a massive boulder rolls without explanation down a nearby hill, just clears Gal's shoulder, and crashes into the perfect square pool, filling it almost completely and breaking the two hearts.
It feels all very Aesop's Fables, somehow.
That night, news arrives of the immanent descent of criminal middleman Don Logan from London to this Spanish paradise.  Gal (Ray Winstone) lives with his beloved wife, former porn actress DeeDee, and two close friends from London, Aitch and Jackie.  All wilt with fear at the mention of Logan's name; his arrival for an overnight visit brings new meaning to the term home invasion.
Logan is played by Ben Kingsley, best known in the title role of Richard Attenborough's ""Gandhi"".  Both the casting and the performance are shocking, and here Kingsley brilliantly and easily earns his Oscar nomination.
Logan turns out to be a swami of ultra-violence, as spare as a shark: a rage-machine in a short-sleeved dress shirt and cheap flannel trousers. His bony, bumpy head, as he sits rigid in the back of a taxi, is bald, still.  He is given to paranoid dialogues with the mirror in the dead of night, winding himself up until he literally kicks Gal out of bed.  His speech is disturbingly speedy, and he has the habit of repeating the pigtails of sentences with brawling disbelief.
Previous collaborations with Logan in high-line robbery have already earned Gal nine years in prison.  Logan, himself under pressure from decadent crime boss Teddy Bass, has come to recruit the unwilling Gal to empty the safety deposit boxes of a London bank, whose vault is billed as one of the most inaccessible in Europe.  (The planned entry is fittingly swank: eight thugs will tunnel through the pool of a Turkish bath adjacent to the bank, creating an underwater ballet of snorkelling and welding gear.)
Gal's clean, spacious hacienda is instantly infused with claustrophobic tension and the atmosphere of domestic violence.  Logan's momentary kindness (shot through with homoerotic yearning, as in his confession to Gal: ""I love you.  You are loveable.  Big loveable bloke"") only wrong-foot the audience, making the next assault sting all the more.  ""Dove the love,"" rhapsodizes Logan.  ""Glamorous Gal, big Gal.  Gorgeous.  You used to have a great body, great physique.  Handsome.""  Logan pivots to invoke DeeDee's resume of old super-16 porn films: ""Dear me.  What a stain on your life.  All the Persil in the world couldn't shift it.  She's disgusting.""
Don Logan won't take no for an answer.  ""Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,"" he screams.  Kingsley unleashes the black comedy in Logan's rage by playing him deadpan, implying Logan's ratty cunning, not Kingsley's irony.
Gal is a bullyboy no longer.  He is touchingly devoted to his marriage and the simple pleasures of lounge lizardry.  He acts as a father-figure to the local pool-boy.  Appraising Gal's beefy, sun-blackened body, Logan hilariously spits out: ""You should be ashamed of yourself.  You look like f***ing Idi Amin.""
Power is exerted through the criminal chain of command through sexual bullying.  Teddy Bass is offered a crack at the bank's vaults by a suavely nude bank president at an orgy they both attend.  Logan veers with terrifying arbitrariness from spasms of homophobia to hints at inconceivable violence.  ""That can all change,"" he threatens Jackie, remarking on her beauty.  ""You've got very nice eyes, DeeDee.  Never noticed them before.  They real?""
Prior to Don's arrival, Gal and Aitch take the pool-boy shooting, and comically fail to bring down the tiny bunny in their sites.  Soon come dreams and hallucinations to haunt Gal featuring a giant, homicidal man-rabbit.  Staged by debut film director Jonathan Glazer, these arty interludes have proven virtually impossible for critics to assimilate, though they are as successful as they are ambitious.  Imagine Matthew Barney splicing the Manx iconography of ""Cremaster 4"" into a hybrid psychodrama-gangster film.  The gun-wielding man-rabbit first appears an emblem of Don Logan, then of Teddy Bass, but later seems to signify dread itself.
Glazer finds a textured ensemble piece in a gangster film, and employs photography of exquisite quality.  His keen formalist instinct enables him to subtly refract audio-visual effect through Gal's first rapturous, later panicky perspective.  The verbal duels of Gal and Don are as captivating as a shoot-out, elevating what might have been a genre film to the status of art.",1053993600,3,6085,5.172978505629478
1668343,5,B00005UV33,"Lovers of bright, airy, farcical British humor are apparently not Jonathan Glazer's target audience. If you enjoy the occasional foray into the dank, dark underbelly of grimy black comedy, however, this should be right up your alley.
No plot spoilers here, but would say that there are certain parallels between what befalls the evil, soul-chomping antagonist, Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) and what eventually happens to the equally insensitive British mobster, Albert Spica (Michael Gambon) in Peter Greenaway's The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover. Kingsley is definitely the menacing lynchpin holding this movie together, though Ian McShane is not far behind him in his portrayal of a believably evil crime lord. Ray Winstone is an inspiration to middle-aged, beer-bellied Buddhas everywhere. Amanda Redman is a revelation as Gal's ex-porn star spouse. She plays the slow boil to perfection. Julian White is also superb playing the wife of Gal's slightly dim buddy, Aitch.
 Which brings us to one of the minor qualifiers I have to warn viewers about. Unless you've grown up in one of the grubbier, East End sections of London, a lot of the dialogue is going to be incomprehensible to you. This is particularly true of Aitch (Cavan Kendall, Kay Kendall's brother). I would definitely recommend the DVD, as opposed to the VHS purchase, as the DVD has a subtitle feature. I can honestly say I was lost without it, before I utilized the function. Kendall also mumbles his lines, as do several other characters. Mumbling and thick, cockney accents do not make for easy comprehension on the part of American viewers.
 This film has a workmanlike plot, with strong performances from all hands. It's great, gritty, black comedy. The funniest thing I've heard for a while is the statement made by Kingsley that he based his character of Don Logan on his grandmother. She must have been quite a lady! I've also discovered, via IMDB, that there may be a link between the guy in the bunny suit and the anti-Harvey in Donnie Darko.

At night, while Don is shaving, he begins taking to himself getting himself worked up.  Suddenly he walks into Gal's bedroom, who is sleeping with his love, and beats Gal while he slept.  Gal and Don have another talk.  Don still tries to pressure Gal into doing the hitman job.  Don finally leaves in a cab to the airport.  Don causes a problem on the flight because he wants to smoke his cigarette during take-off.  Later, he goes back to Gal's house with a vengeance.  Don is out of control.  Gal is hurt.

1668357,4,B00005UV33,"Following the recent tendency set by young british directors like Guy Ritchie (""Lock, stock and two smoking barrels"" and ""Snatch""), Jonathan Glazer's ""Sexy beast"" is fast paced, colorful (even if it's based on dark grounds), with an unusual script and more unusual camera angles and shots (there's a scene when we see a roling boulder through the boulder's point of view!).
The story is about retired gangster Gal, played by Ray Winstone. He's about forty-five, a little bit overweight, living with his beautiful wife in a glamorous and sunny spanish villa. Then word reaches him a guy named Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) is looking for him for a final j ob. When we're introduced to Don Logan, he's not even on screen, but the faces the characters make when they're talking about Logan are enough to foresee what Logan's presence means. But in fact it's worse. Ben Kingsley, in an excellent performance, brings to life a raw, machine-gun-swearing, tactless person, a character created to bring rage even to eventual old-ladies who will watch the movie. Everything he does and says is directed to do harm to someone else. His job is to convince Gal to do this last job, but he's not going to have an easy time, brute or not.
""Sexy beast"" is different from other movies of the genre, because its story concentrates not on the making of the ""final job"", but rather on the relationship of Don Logan with the other main characters, and that made the difference for me. Also, the fact that, except for Kingsley and James Fox, I knew none of the other actors, made the movie more believable. The funny thing is that Kingsley based the Logan character on his grandmother.
Not a light entertainment, but no plot twists every five minutes either. An OK movie whose foundations lay on Kingsley's outstanding performance.

""Sexy Beast"", though marketed as  a gangster film, is only the skeleton of one. In fact the film's sole point of interest is its jilted protagonist , Don Logan .

In an attempt to convince Gal to return with him to London, Logan abuses and assaults everyone he encounters with Kingsley spitting cockney profanities and throwing his strange body around like a spoilt child .

  A retired gangster is enjoying ""the life"" in his villa in Spain along with his ex-porn star gorgeous wife and friends. This idyllic setting is about to get seriously disturbed though when his former ""employers"" call him back to work for one ""last"" major job.
  His initial thoughts are to refuse to have any part in this and resume kicking it big under the sunny spanish sky. Not so fast. The man who comes to convince him to participate is a man with the reputation of a psycho played superbly by Ben Kingsley (yes, the ""Gahndi"" Kingsley). Alerady before ""Don""'s (kingsley) arrival the whole household goes on red alert as they know that this is a man who won't go back with a no for an answer and who will let his psychosis out in full blow to get the ex-gangster to join in in his hand-picked team.
  As Don arrives, we are entertained by brilliant dialogue, as both characters engage in a verbal confrontation. Don is clearly winning the battle but the ex-gangster is heroically not caving in till the very end where a nice surprise ending is in store as the last big job takes place.
  Kingsley's performance is nothing short of unforgettable. He puts new dimensiions in the genre of cinematic psychos. While the film is actually barely violent it's Kingsley's portrayal of ""Don"" that makes it very intense and will keep you captured for the entirety of the movie. There is constantly an atmosphere of things about to explode, of constant tension and human insanity.
  In fact, there is no actor doing a below par job here. The directing is excellent as is the script which is great mostly due to its astoundingly intense dialogues.

There are scenes that are very tense. Just good cinema. The director had his roots in the music industry and it is another reminder of the great debt cinema is now owing the music video industry as a testing ground.
So what exactly is the sexy beast? There is a beast in the film and he - or she - is not remotely sexy.

The movie receive excellent reviews for its incisive script, sharp acting and non-sensational treatment. He played ""the Brain"" the real life man that masterminded a heist of a bank in the Riviera, where they tunnelled under the vault in very elaborate and high tech fashion.
This movie, once again, showcases McShane as the mastermind of a super heist, this time as Teddy Bass ""Mr. Black Magic Himself"" and it show that 23 years has not dulled McShane's black magic one bit. Though not the star of the movie, he steals the show, which is no mean feat with the super cast which includes Ben Kingsley and James Fox.
Ray Winstone plays a former London gangster that has retired to the good life in Spain. As far as he is concerned he is out of the business, happy with the lay-back life and wants nothing to do with the old 'business'.

1668378,4,B00005UV33,"Sexy Beast is a likable(but dark) English Mob film with a special ingrediant.  Ben Kingsley plays Don Logan, who is perhaps the most memorable, over the top character to appear in a film since Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth in Blue Velvet.
Gal and his other English ex-patriates have retired from the crime scene of London to the sunny coast of Spain.  Here they live a life of leisure and contentment, until storm cloud in the person of Don Logan looms on their once sunny horizon.  Logan appears as an unstoppable force of violence determined for Gal to return with him to London for one last heist.  The relaxed air of the seaside Shangri-la is suddenly thick with tension and dread. Paradise has been lost.
The film moves on to London where we meet the menacing crime boss Teddy Bass who persents a different level of evil than Don Logan.  A creative heist occurs and then Gal must find his way back to Spain.
I feel that the film peaks in the middle with the arrival of Logan then peters out toards the end. When Don Logan is not involved in certain scenes after his arrival, the level of electricity dimminishes somewhat. Another item that can make this a difficult film are the thick Cockneye accents which take a while to acclimate to.

A lot of people spoke well of Ben Kingsley's intense performance and it was intense, but that doesn't make up for lack of plot or story.
Ok, now that all the Sexy Beast partisans hate me, I will say that the cinematography was top notch and the commentary track was worthwhile.  There were great moments of tension in the movie between Kingsley and anyone, and later between the mob boss and our hero, Ray Winstone.

Most of the movie revolves around a few retired gangsters that are trying to avoid being pulled back in by the dominating character that Kingsley portrays.  While there are a few moments of interest overall it fails.  I would recommend ""The Suicide Kings"" before this movie if you are looking at off beat movies about gangsters and friends.

1668383,3,B00005UV33,"Ben Kingsley delivers a bone-chilling performance as the man everyone loves to hate, a role for which he earned not only universal critical acclaim but a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination as well.  Don Logan is so evil that even his fellow mobster buddies fear and hate him.  From our very first glimpse of him high-strutting his way through an airport terminal, Kingsley hits just the right note for his character.  Cleverly, writers Louis Mellis and David Scinto have paved the way for this entrance by introducing Logan ahead of time in a series of conversations in which just the mere mention of his name sets off portentous reverberations amongst the people discussing him.
Chief among those people is the film's protagonist, Gal, Logan's ""retired"" ex-partner in crime, who wants nothing more than to be allowed to enjoy life undisturbed in his seaside Spanish villa with his swimming pool and the wife he loves so dearly.  But Gal soon discovers that a person cannot escape his past forever, when Logan suddenly shows up at his doorstep demanding that Gal join his own personally hand-picked gang of seasoned criminals whom Logan has brought together to pull off a major heist back in Merry Olde England.  Gal would like nothing better than to send Logan home packing empty handed, but he also knows that defying Logan can be the fastest route to an early demise.  It is this atmosphere of fear and dread that director Jonathon Glazer uses to make ""Sexy Beast"" such an engrossing and off beat little crime drama.
In fact it is the THREAT of violence, far more than the violence itself, which distinguishes this tale.  Without the use of weapons of any kind, Logan is able to cow and terrorize a roomful of reasonably fearless adults simply by his steely-eyed demeanor and the unpredictable nature of his temperament.  Seemingly controlled and rational one moment, he can suddenly erupt into a volcano of exploding anger the next.  One of the most chilling moments in the film occurs aboard a departing airplane in which Logan refuses to douse his cigarette, thereby precipitating a confrontation with the flight crew.  Logan has that quality that distinguishes all great villains:  he throws us back on our heels by his refusal to conform to the social amenities that the rest of us simply take for granted and which put us at a decided disadvantage when faced with the evil characters of the world who know no rules and flagrantly disregard the ones we follow.  He reminds us of how weak and vulnerable the rest of us really are.
Logan, for all the intensity generated by his character, is not, however, the focal point of the film.  Gal, brilliantly played by Ray Winstone, who provides a fascinating counterpoint to Logan's no-holds-barred villainy, occupies that position.  Despite his criminal background, Gal wins us over by his openhearted frankness, his sincere devotion to his wife, friends and neighbors, and his obvious desire to lead a straight life from hereon out.  Winstone underplays his scenes superbly, yet he never allows himself to be acted off the screen by the fiery Kingsley.  (One should mention that the heavy accents of the characters make what they are saying a bit incomprehensible attimes).
As is not uncommon in gangster movies these days, Glazer manages to inject an element of black humor into the proceedings.  The comedy often takes the form of twisted surrealism, such as when a giant boulder rolls down a nearby hillside and lands plop in Gal's beloved pool, barely missing taking Gal to the bottom with it.  The filmmakers also have an effective way of heightening the tension through indirection, particularly in the early scenes which prime us to dread Logan's entrance as much as the characters who don't want to see him - and we haven't even met him yet.  This technique of telegraphing information ahead of time contributes immensely to heightening the suspenseful quality of the film.
""Sexy Beast"" provides superb performances, a nasty sense of humor and a fascinating glimpse into the dark side of human nature.",1027641600,2,4066,4.935483870967742
1668384,2,B00005UV33,"Once you get over the shock of seeing Ghandi's evil alter-ego swearing, prowling and generally spreading menace, it becomes all too clear that Sexy Beast is a shallow, lowest common denominator heist flick, that looks to cash in on the strong returns of other recent Brit-gangster movies. As in the unbelievably overrated Snatch, the presence of strong, exaggerated cockney accents and an endless stream of profanity and violence seem to constitute both the plot and humour of this supposed 'dark' comedy. What is hilarious is hearing critics like Peter Travers fawn over the 'deadly, and darkly comic, duel of wits' between Logan (Ben Kingsley) and Gary (Ray Winstone.) Apparently lines such as ""Tell me you'll do it,"" ""No I won't"", ""Yes you...will!"" constitute sharp dialogue and edge-of-seat tension. For me, hearing Kingsley say ""Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes!"" over and over again leads to irritation followed quickly by boredom. Any semblance of a plot is largely absent, and it was hardly surprising to find out that first time director, Jonathan Glazer, used to make music videos. Like Guy Ritchie and David Fincher, Glazer relies on video-clip trickery, rarely keeping the camera still for more than several seconds at a time, except when focusing in on Kingsley's menacing stare. Such effects are of course necessary, lest the glaring lack of plot and well-constructed dialogue be exposed.",1026345600,2,1393,5.195555555555556

At the end, I said ""IS THAT IT!?!""  I was truly surprised.  I didn't feel like I had watched a movie.  It wasn't terrible or anything, just disappointing.  Guess it just depends on your taste.  Maybe if there was more character development?  Honestly, it seemed more an exercise for Kingsley as an actor, or perhaps a one-dimensional display of a crazed, violent personality.  This film missed something.",1026259200,2,579,4.927083333333333
1668386,4,B00005UV33,"This is a strangely compelling film, made so by the riveting performance of Ben Kingsley, who plays vitriolic, psychotic, British gangster, Don Logan. With a pulse pounding, rat-a-tat-tat delivery of lines and with a totally sinister and utterly ruthless persona, Don Logan, spewing cockney accented venom, is about as frightening a gangster as one may imagine. It is no wonder that Kingsley was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance.
The plot is simple. Retired thief, Gary ""Gal"" Dove (Ray Winstone), is living a relaxing, carefree life with his wife, DeeDee (Amanda Redman), an ex-porn star whom he clearly adores. With their ill gotten gains, they live in a beautiful, luxurious villa in Spain. They have a pool boy, Enrique, a local boy of whom they are clearly fond and who, it turns out, is fond of them. Former gangster, Aitch (Cavan Kendall) and his significant other, Jackie (Julianne White) also live in Spain. They all hang out together, living the good life.  Their idyllic and carefree, expatriate lives are all shattered one day by the unwelcome intrusion of Don Logan, who comes to see Gal, as he wants to bring Gal out of retirement and back to England for one more heist. Don makes him an offer that, ultimately, due to a series of events, Gal finds that he cannot refuse.
The film is really not so much about the heist itself, though it is an integral part of the film. It is really about love, and what one will do to protect those that one loves. While Kingsley's performance is a showstopper, Ray Winstone gives a notable performance as a teddy bearish kind of guy. He is a retired gangster who has gone soft and just wants to live the good life in peace with his wife and with the company of a few friends. He truly does not want to be involved in the heist. He just wants to get out from under. Amanda Redman give a strong performance as DeeDee, a woman who will stop at nothing to secure the sanctity of her home and the safety of those whom she loves. Ian McShane is appropriately menacing and single minded as the mob boss heading up the heist. The rest of the cast is also superlative, making this an excellent, though different, gangster flick.
Be forewarned that the language employed by Don Logan in the film is absolutely filthy and offensive, and it is intended to be. So, if your sensibilities are easily offended, this is not the film for you. Moreover, the cockney accented delivery of lines was sometimes so fast, that I ended up watching the widescreen version with the English language subtitles on, so that I would not miss a thing.

1668408,5,B00005UV33,"The film is a psychological character study disguised as a heist film. The dream sequences with the rabbit and Don Logan himself embody the subconscious fear and shame that people have. Don Logan is a walking metaphor for this subconscious fear - he is a man without inhibitions, strangely Tourettic: an Id personified. He forces people to confront their pasts and inferiority complex in a horrifyingly painful and gleeful manner. There's nothing else like it in my memory of other films. It's a crime that Kingsley didn't win the Oscar for the role of Don Logan. I don't recall ever seeing such a forthrightly menacing performance from anyone in movies.
There's fine acting by everyone involved. The writing is superb - the dialogue is tough and crisp and poetically underwritten. The director Glazer understands well that tension is at its most unbearably taut point when the silence reaches its deepest, most awkward point. The nervous energy of suspense of some scenes in this film is awful and intense.
The story of a main character Gal, a heistman who is hapless and in love, is touching. Through it all, it's his story of love that tempers the violence of the film. It's a great move on the writer's part to choose this character's story as the main through-line.

However, like a boulder which comes from nowhere, Ben Kingsley's character descends on the little family unit of two retired criminals and their wives.  Ben Kingsley's performance is similar to Denzel Washington's in Training Day -- they chew up every scene.  The acting was good throughout.  There's also some neat scenes where the main character imagines the devil.
What's the problem with the movie?  There's no character development, nobody really changes their minds or attitudes, the heist is boring, and the final destination of Ben Kingsley's character is no surprise (but the movie seems to think it is).",1022976000,2,791,5.0

One mean little sob, Logan terrorizes his reluctant hosts and Kingsley is absolutely riveting and believable as this vicious rat-terrier of a man who will NOT take ""No"" for an answer.
Ray Winstone is ""Gal"" Dove, a retired gangster living on the coast of Spain, accompanied by his wife and another retired hood & his wife.  Gal has become relaxed, tan and comfortable in his retirement villa, and the announcement that Logan has called and is on his way to Spain puts a pall of dread on everyone.
Justified dread as it turns out, because Logan has come to pull Gal out of retirement to do a job with his old crew in London.  Gal wants none of it, but Logan is not going to be denied. Logan is the embodiment of the criminal's code that once ""in"" you can never get out.  He is ruthless & determined and Kingsley's performance is a tour-de-force.
There is a heist, there is the ever present threat of violence and the violence itself, and other characters and complications I won't spoil by divulging.  Suffice it to say this is a neat piece of work, and well worth seeing.
Ben Kingsley is one of my favorite actors.  Superb in everything from his Oscar for the role I cite in the title, to Stern in Schindler's List, to the tormented chess teacher in Searching for Bobby Fisher, to the unforgettable Don Logan in this film.  The man has range!

Ben Kingsley as psychopath/sociopath Don is outstanding - he really is not someone you would want to have around - hence the retired criminals real fear of having him visit. The script writing for all of them is superb, as Don is a recognizably different kind of criminal to all of the others. Ian McShane is excellent too, but he is the standard stuff of movie hardmen. Don is different: his sociopathic tendencies: no small talk, inappropriate and bizarrely obsessive talk and observations, single mindedness, but also every now and then his ability to manipulate situations (when in custody at the airport was unusual and believable). Clearly he is one person who has the potential to do absolutely anything to get his way. When Don is off screen the film becomes much more an ordinary heist job.

His domestic life in Spain has repressed his former rogueish self.  The latter is now relegated to creepy appearances in the sub-conscious (the beast?).
Kingsley has quite a task in creating a character as fearsome and intimidating as Logan, especially without the help of any background information.  And he does a great job at it.  What plays out on the screen seems like an abstraction of an inner conflict between the protaginist's id (the beast) and his superego (Logan AND domestication).  This makes for a complex battle that offers no perfect solution, until, of course, love conquers evil..  what?!?!?!
Well, at the beginning, love is injured symbollicaly by a giant boulder (earth's immoveable counterpart to Logan crashes into the pool and smashes the twin hearts on the floor).  Then the real boulder, Logan,  comes into the scene and forces out the Spanish boy (protaginist's inner child and ego) and pulls our hero back into the crime life. In London, we get to see some fancy heist-movie stuff (to satisfy the target audience of the marketers, I suppose) and learn a little more about what transpired back in Spain.  All the criminal characters are great, by the way.
Once all the nasty business in London is taken care of, our protaginist (I don't usually use such language but I forgot the guy's name..)  returns to domestic life and repairs his love life, both figuratively and actually..  The hearts are repaired, and a nice surprise is waiting underneath (totally predictable, but a nice touch nevertheless).  The last scene with Ben Kingsley, however, is ridiculous, even though it offers a clever denouement to the subconsious battle suffered by the protaginist.  It seemed like something out of ""From Dusk Till Dawn.""
If you like picking apart accents and clever dialogue, this movie is worthwhile.  I don't agree with some people that this is a great film, but it is an interesting study with fabulous acting.

As for Kingsley: believe all the raves you've heard. He creates a truly frightening character in the violent, foul-mouthed, abusive Logan.

1668433,2,B00005UV33,"unsure why this got so much hype(then again,im still miffed by the kudos the abysmal training day received!).here we have what amounts to a jealous tough guy(ben kingsley)who forcefully recruits a long time business associate.seems like theres ONE MORE JOB to pull of.and hes not taking no for an answer.this so called bad guy is so under developed its sickening.for the most part,its him asking/telling and his would be recruit to take this job,and then having recruit say no.this volleys back and forth until even the director/writer got sick of it and sent ben to airport.this is where the jealousy enters.without giving everything away,i found this to be pretty dull.theres some nice yelling and a couple of quirky moments but they quickly fade and give way to alot of nothing.i do not suggest anyone waste their time/money on this.instead,get mean streets.",1017100800,2,861,5.113475177304965
1668434,3,B00005UV33,"First off, I found this movie hard to understand at times, the English accents were so thick, I really had to force myself to pay very close attention to everything.
There came a particular scene in ""sexy beast"" that forced me to turn it off as it held no revelence to the film whatsoever.  If it was to the director and writer, I failed to see what this was supposed to bring to the film.  Also, the over used foul term that begins with c and ends with t was used more like it was a regularly used word.  Well, it is a very disgusting word, and I don't know why the writer chose this word.  It must be a very frequently spoken in England.  Also, I just think there is far too much swearing.  Do screenwriters really think that making the characters swear is going to make a film?
The reason I started my review with this gripe is because this is what brought it down to just three stars. I thought it was a very entertaining, fast paced, in your face love story/heist/gangster movie, and I liked it.  It's original and daring and is bold.
Ben Kingsley, who is playing perhaps the most evil I have ever seen him play, is outstanding!  What an actor!  Here is an actor who is so versatile, and his performance is so amazing.  I just can't believe the audacity of Don Logan, his character here.  This is one of the most menacing characters on film.  The dialogue that springs from his lips is truly mouth dropping and just down right shocking at times.
Gal, played with great precision by Ray Winstone, is a just retired ""gangster""  and is asked by Logan to do a job.  Logan, is beastly and was once romantically linked to one of them women in the film. Gal is married to Deedee, a former porno actress.  She isn't the one from Logan's affair.  She is very happily married to Gal who totally seems to adore her.
I will not give much more away about this film, but it is very much worth viewing to the viewer with an open mind.  There is some gore and graphic scenes that may be disturbing to some.
However, it has a good plot that kept me watching to the end once I cued the dvd back up.  It has biting humour, strange visions of bunny rabbits, and is one the best films of 2001.",1016755200,,2177,4.242718446601942
1668435,4,B00005UV33,"This the movie that earned Ben Kingsley a best supporting actor nomination. He played Gandhi but you'd never believe it after seeing him in this part as a psychotic Cockney crook. He is so intense and scary -- really spooky! It's an English film about a couple of retired crooks and their wives who are enjoying a leisurely life in Spain. Then they get a call from London from one of their former cohorts, who intends to make one of them an 'offer he can't refuse' to go back to London and take part in a job. The former crook REALLY, REALLY doesn't want to come out of retirement and there is the crux of the matter. The four ex-patriots are really likeable and it's hard not to envy their idyllic lifestyle, so it makes you feel the intensity of their desire NOT to stir things up and get caught up in the old, bad times. It was really a good movie, very different, with some unexpectedly likeable characters and some actors that have always been likeable in previous roles who definitely are NOT likeable in this one. It isn't so much violent as very tense with a slowly building anticipation of violence to come that makes you sit on the edge of your seat. The cinematography is great and this is that rare thing -- an original movie.",1016409600,5,1238,4.4104803493449785
1668436,4,B00005UV33,"When you get past the kinetic violence, language, and mildly disturbing sexual imagery, the center of this film is the big, lumbering, sweet character of Gal (Ray Winstone) and his love for his wife and the life they have in southern Spain. Yes, Ben Kingsley is typically great (although I am a bit bewildered by the critic's shock at his ability to portray such an evil character, as if he's played nothing but saints all his career. Did anyone see Bugsy?) But the true anchors of this film are the wonderful performance of Ray Winstone, the script that keeps things simple and focused, and the strong supporting characters (particularly Ian McShane as the slimily charming Teddy Bass). Not a date movie, but definitely a love story.",1016409600,,734,4.833333333333333

7955372,3,B00005UV33,"I purchased this DVD after hearing a glowing review on TV.  I should have known what to expect- the reviewer spoke endlessly about the great performance given by Ben Kingsley.  But haven't we come to rely upon Kingsley for a great performance?

What is missing here is any sort of a story worth committing to film. Okay, Sir Ben can play a scary man - yes.  But, (spoiler alert) a criminal retires to Spain only to have an old accomplice arrive (Kingsley) to insist the retiree join in a caper - retiree doesn't want to - but of course does. Kingsley's character bullies four adults in secluded spot - things do not go well.  Violence ensues.  Ho hum.

Better to watch him in a film worth your time.  3 stars because, yes, Ben Kingsley can act.  But he cannot salvage this thin scrap of a story.",1390780800,,795,4.390410958904109
