8609231,5,B00ET9EV7Q,"Sinawali (for those not in the know) means pattern or weave.
It is performed in FMA with two weapons.  There may be many patterns.  Most Ive seen are symmetrical...and necessarily so...because the training method with a partner necessitates synchronicity (equal timing).  SO WHY IS THE AIM OF THIS DVD DIFFERENT?

Consider this quote from the DVD  ""We can hit sticks or not hit sticks it doesnt matter""  ""There is no difference between our sparring method, and that we would utilize in combat""
Unrealistic?  Please consider this...

The aim of bladed combat is not to hit the weapon...the aim of weapon contact that should be made is blade on BODY!
Sinawali?  Please, YOUTUBE ANY VIDEO of Sinawali and THEN watch this.

Sinawali is a STYLE, The implications of this it has a range where it is preferentially utilized has its own advantages and is effective in its own right IF THE OPPONENT STAYS IN THAT RANGE DESIGNATED FOR THE PATTERN PRESENTED.
PTK is a SYSTEM, not a style, not a collection of techniques.  Among other things, this means that its PRINCIPLES of combat strategy adhere to ALL weapons categories.  OF course, certain weapon categories have certain advantages....and THAT is where the lesson of this DVD aims.  HOW TO USE THIS WEAPON CATEGORY MOST EFFECTIVELY

The brilliance of PTKGO's articulation of PTK is the emphasis of the training methods utilized.  Training with a solo weapon with dynamic footwork is not easy....TWO weapons, edged or impact is exceptionally challenging...and its not intuitive as to how training in this method is to be accomplished....but its laid out here in a progressive way from SYMMETRICAL PATTERNS toward ASSYMETRICAL striking ....the presentation aim of this weapons category on this DVD as with all of Tuhon Waid's is to show how the training method integrates directly to the practice of dynamic combat.  Dynamic because the best striking patterns mean little without observing and understanding the proper range and timing to execute them...and unlike the sinawali you'll youtube....you'll see just how different it is to successfully launch an attack with your weapons to hit your moving target...who, armed ambidextrously, can corner and quarter you on EITHER side of your defenses....which you are forced to reckon with ambidextrously at every angle, timing, and range.  THAT is FMA flow and that is what this DVD SERIES showcases uniquely and effectively.  Reconsidering Sinawali, perhaps this is how Sinawali was meant to be utilized as a STRATEGY ...at least in the symmetrical striking pattern aspects.",1422835200,,2565,5.169491525423729
8609232,5,B00ET9EV7Q,"Once again Tim Waid demonstrates mastery of movement, not only with impact weapons (rattan) but also double long blades. Great drills and tactics for fundamental development of Doble Kalis material  solo training and partner drills. The training in the video is fundamental for acquiring the ability to manipulate impact weapons (rattan) effectively and will also directly translate to bladed weapons with practice. The DVD offers solid tactics for double weapon applications as well as building the foundation needed for advancing in the system of Pekiti-Tirsia. Tim Waid and assistants also demonstrate what is being taught in live, free-flow sparring. Watch closely for the great details that are physically shown in drills, tactics, and free-flow sparring.",1420761600,,760,5.608695652173913
8609233,5,B00ET9EV7Q,The instruction in this video is valid and worth the purchase. The one star rating is obviously some sort of slander attempt by a small minded individual. If I could make any suggestion in the future I would slow some of the movements down while explaining or include slow motion footage to supplement the regular speed footage.,1418774400,2,328,4.771929824561403
8609234,1,B00ET9EV7Q,This is like a very simplistic sinawali variation DVD. Not worth it in my opinion. Don't waste your money.,1418083200,,106,4.631578947368421
