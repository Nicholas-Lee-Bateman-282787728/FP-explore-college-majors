7807966,5,6300215067,"A fun session with prop comedian Gallagher. In this show he is using the old sledge-o-matic but he has a few other things up his short sleeves, like a former mouseketeer tap dancer, a whimsical model airship and how not to wear bathing costumes. Some of the jokes might be predictable (if you've seen some of his shows in the 80s), some of the jokes might be dated, but overall it works really well and everybody has fun!",1429315200,,421,4.410256410256411
7807967,5,6300215067,"I remember Gallager while I was growin up. Tried to go see him several times in Atlanta, Ga and Charlottee, NC, and could not get tickets. I did see him several time on HBO specials. He is so funny is his own way. So now I have part of his collection.",1347926400,,251,3.9411764705882355

7807969,5,6300215067,"This is a classic of all gallagher movies. He is one of the
funniest standup comedians in the world. I've been watching
him since I was little boy he is so outragous & smart. He makes you think about things that you normally don't think about. So buy this movies you won't be disappointed. GET DOWN!!!",999734400,2,301,4.392857142857143
