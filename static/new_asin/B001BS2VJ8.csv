8284488,5,B001BS2VJ8,"This series does a great job of highlighting some of professional football's greatest teams.  As a football fan, I really like the historical feel that brings back games I remember as a small boy.  As a Dolphins fan, this is quite simply a ""Must Own.""
I love this series!",1371081600,,271,4.510204081632653
8284489,5,B001BS2VJ8,"Great DVD.  Exactly what I wanted.  Packaged very well and quick delivery.  Huge Dolphins fan, so it was nice to see entire season in 1 hour of video.",1360886400,,150,4.285714285714286
8284490,5,B001BS2VJ8,"Look for the boxed set of the whole series and buy it instead.  It is the best thing that NFL films ever produced.  One thing I will say about this particular video.  There are 40 in the set, with 3-4 players/coaches on each...out of 120+ people on this whole series.  Mercury Morris is the only one I couldn't stand after watching.  The 1980 Raiders one even made me like Matt Millen...and I am from Detroit.  Personally (and if you watch this video you'll know what I am talking about) I think that Merc said ""I am sorry Mr Kuechenberg, let me find some music to your tastes.""  Bob would have crushed him",1267660800,,606,4.357142857142857
