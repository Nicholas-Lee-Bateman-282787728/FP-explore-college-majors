This is a Good Collection of Crime, Thiller and Mystery, However the title should be called ""Mass Murderers and Serial Killers"" because Speck (mass murderer) and Manson (killer cult leader) like Gein (not on the list as the necrophiliac turned desperate) are not Technically Serial Killers. Why they are included, I truly don't know.

But without further a do, here is a brief review of each movie. Each disc is not in order that is stated on the cover, therefore the list is on the disc surface.

1) 2:13 has the atmosphere and lighting as Seven, and a troubled Man working as a forensic Profiler is out to catch a Brutal Serial killer.

Likes: starts off nice, some twists to the story, good effects, intriguing characters, few unknown actors carry the movie wonderfully, script is well written.

Dislikes: the Therapy scenes could be reduced, more scenes on the Killer doing onscreen deaths should have been done. The ending is like many movies on troubled cops who kick the habit eg Sea of Love

2) the Prophets Game stars the legendary Dennis Hopper is another troubled Cop, and a menacing Serial killer wants to play with his head with riddles.

Likes : Cameo of Don Swayze, the Saw quality of cat and mouse game, surprise identity on who is the killer

Dislikes : the film took a while to get to where it needs to go, predictable at parts.

3) All God's Creatures is about Handsome Jon, works as a Barista by day, and a Hunter of ""filthy Women"" by night, meets his Destiny in a form of a Troubled but Pretty Prostitute, Delia, who tries to get clean but struggles to support herself in the process, so Jon faces his demons, can he see her for more than what she is? They both hide their darkest Secrets of who they are, but as the friendship becomes a passionate sexual affair, the more they get closer to the truth of each other. Also had Award nominations in 2011.

Likes : the unconventional love story that came out a year before the 50 shades of grey novels, where two different Human beings try to compromise, the innocent or milder one discovers their darkest side to link with the dysfunctional Lover who is the darker one who develops sensitivity. Great idea and original bold Movie, you care about the main characters.

Dislikes : the photography can get unfocused, the lighting can be dull, but overall, I had a good time watching it for its unique plot

4) Room zero is a clever Documentary style on a Biopic of Serial killer Wayne Adam Ford, as model and actress Victoria Redstall is his confidant and reporting presenter

Likes : the Style of the movie is good, the acting is absorbing, and how the narrative dialogue and imagery can hold the viewers interest

Dislikes : I guessed where the movie was heading, especially between the characters.

5) Speck is about a Real life mass murderer and rapist of apprentice nurses in Chicago city

Likes : the actresses that played the Novice Nurses are amazing and You really care about them, angry at the brutality afflicted upon them. You are as helpless as they are watching them.

Dislikes : this is the most irritating movie I ever watched, because the entire script of Richard Speck is filled entirely with recognised quotes of Henry Lee Lucas, Richard Ramirez, Ted Bundy etc and it is so blooming annoying, for those who want to know Speck will get misinformation because he is a mass murderer, different to a Serial killer, and yet quotes of confessions on different Serial killers that are in their youth in the mid sixties. It is lazy script writing and waste on the viewers time. The angled camera shots are annoying. Most of the movie is annoying, accept the Actresses are the only highlight.

6) the Ted Bundy Story: Ann Rule the Stranger beside me, Barbara Hershey plays the best selling crime novelist who realised that her Friend Ted is not all he seems

Likes: great cast, Billy Campbell who has more sharp angles and thinner visage than the real Ted, but he has the aloof, cocky, cold attitude and superficial charm like the actual Ted, the best so far since the young and handsome Mark Harmon (who terrified me as a young child), because other Actors that played Bundy were cartoon like as a buffoon with catchphrases, and lacked the dangerous, cunning, scary personality that he is (especially when he mentions in a real life interview that he would kill a man to cover his tracks). I like how they go deep into Bundy's past, even Ted's First Girlfriend Victoria also known as Stephanie Brooks makes an appearance. Enjoyed the movie and the script is good.
Ted is one of the most effectively creepy Criminals that ever lived.

Dislikes : they missed out Kimberley Leach murder, and using Ted to find the Green River Killer. They had to rush the movie in the end, but I suppose Ann Rule did have a lot to tell. Plus the targeted Victims are ought to be brunette long hair, but not blonde, the same mistake is in another Ted Bundy movie stars Michael Reilly Burke with that same falsified illustration.
Also the true habits of Bundy as a kleptomaniac, constant nose picker, and flunked student of Law and psychology isn't embarked, he was immature, incompetent and vile which is why Stephanie dumped him, despite he was great at professional skiing she felt he wasn't serious enough, in other words, Ted's superficial suave and personable manners are a show, an act to make a mockery in what Women want. Stephanie who is Victoria in the movie may be an object of jealously and admiration; she had Beauty, Brains, a middle Class Princess, not as witchy as people think, she felt he wasn't ready emotionally - you could say he pinned his hopes on her, Stephanie reflected what many Ted Bundy movies always cut out, and that is Ted Bundy's original personality.

7) The six degrees of Helter Skelter, is another documentary movie based on what really went on before, during and after the murders of Tate-polanski and the La Biancas, and how each one is connected in a ""small world"" kind of way

Likes : starts off okay, rebukes some myths, and puts the light into the case that is so sensationalised by notoriety, and how most people want to be a part of the most famous case in American history.

Dislikes : it is not 1:03 minutes, it is a tedious 1:42 minutes, the last half is about showing signs of name places, unsteady camera shots, the narrator is garrulous, could have interviewed some Manson family members, and La Bianca relatives, but no, it was monotone, dragging, and boring, at one point the Narrator wanted to find the ""family"" Bus in death valley, and he comes across a heap of metal and goes "" that must be it"" what a bore, who cares.
Also another point I like to make is where did he get his ""new found"" Information from to debunk events or create new events, I could understand the heavily Pregnant Sharon Tate's mood, but what about the other theories, any reference to support his claims are real, interviews on law officers, Lawyers, the Orderly perhaps? It is the most poorly described and made, disastrous documentary I ever sat through. That is why I am giving reviews to save lives.

I recommend a better Movie called ""The Manson Family"" stars Marcelo Games as Charles, and it is Brutal, compelling, and shocking, watch that instead.

8) Interview with a Serial Killer is set in my hometown London, England. When Attractive novelist of true crime allows her new tenant in her home, she suspects him to be the Angel of Death killing blonde women, but things take a drastic turn as she probes further

Likes : good twists to the movie, watchable, the acting is good, script is clever to lead the story

Dislikes : The characters did not seem believable and one dimensional, Ellen is a novelist, but lives off One female tenant before the Guy came along, a free lance writer is not a journalist on a regular job, but a free lance novelist. Living is tight to survive, plus a house of her own, I'm confused.

So there you have it, they are low budget films, some better than average. Still enjoyed the collection, I do have personal favourites though.",1497225600,,8112,4.634146341463414
