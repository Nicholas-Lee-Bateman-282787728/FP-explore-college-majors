The high production values are especially impressive. The film includes many re-enactment scenes that are very authentic-looking, better quality than what one typically sees on the History Channel. And the balance of scholars from the Islamic, Jewish, and Christian traditions yields a satisfyingly broad perspective.

3086188,4,B0012911D8,"This is my first year teaching 7th grade history and since our textbook covers material very quickly and not in much depth, I am always looking for supplemental material.

This was perfect to help cover the chapters on Islamic history.  It provided wonderful detail, highlighted the architecture, and areas discussed and was at an appropriate level for my middle school students.  The only downside was that we were unable to access the captions.  I'm hard of hearing and my students kept asking me how to spell the names of people or to go back so that they could get the details right for their notes.  Without the closed captioning available, it made it difficult to provide accurate information to my students.

In addition, PBS on-line had a wonderful lesson plan to highlight the information.  My students enjoyed the film.  The only catch is that it is quite long.  With only a 45 minute class period, it took us over a week to view and discuss this one film.",1414713600,,966,4.7023809523809526

3086190,5,B0012911D8,"This is the most balanced and fair documentary I have ever seen on this subject. I use it every semester in my college level classes. All other programming I have ever found seems to want to follow the age-old story-line of how awful the Muslims were and how the Christians liberated Spain, when that isn't even remotely close to the truth. Even while getting my MA degree this period of history was mostly ignored by the department. I spent hours talking to my professors privately about it since for some reason schools don't seem to want to teach about the cultural Golden Age for Muslims and Jews and Andalusian Christians. Even outside of Spain this time is known as the Golden Age in Jewish and Islamic culture.

This video at least brings something to balance out 1000 years of bias.",1388361600,,790,4.642857142857143

3086193,5,B0012911D8,"Wonderful review of the period of Moorish rule in Spain and the many positive influences that Islam had on the peninsula itself and ultimately on Europe as a whole. The Muslims brought science, medicine, and a love of literature and the arts, things lost to Europe in the Dark Ages following the collapse of the Roman Empire.
Did this provide the seeds of the Renaissance?

The relative tolerance of Muslim rule and their equality of treatment of ""people of the book"" allowed harmony between Muslim, Christian and Jew, perhaps the only time and place this had occurred extensively. Could this lesson on tolerance be helpful in today's troubled times?",1370476800,,650,4.963302752293578
3086194,3,B0012911D8,"Too much Hollywood-style dramatization of events - especially battles, and not enough of the actual cities. Although 'When The Moors Ruled in Europe' is far better, the Jews were only mentioned once. In this documentary the contributions the Jews made to Islamic Spain were very much emphasized.",1359590400,,295,5.297872340425532
3086195,5,B0012911D8,"This film is a balanced overview of the history of Islam in Spain.  In fact, it provides an accurate historical account with the mostly positive contributions of Muslims to a civilized society and one which practiced tolerance for Jews and Christians.  At the same time, it does not overlook actions by a minority of extremists who sought to destroy tolerance at certain historical periods.  One must remember Islam existed in Spain for some 700-800 years.  I would recommend this film as a study tool for students of Islamic History in Spain.",1353628800,,543,4.934065934065934
3086196,4,B0012911D8,"First of all, this is a documentary that stands out for its cinematography and its editing. It's wonderfully crafted and feels very cinematic without coming off as gaudy or too Hollywood. The people who are interviewed are knowledgeable experts in their field and provide much insight into the historical facts that the documentary presents. The only thing that I felt held back the documentary was the fact that the film focused more on the utopian moments of cultural interaction and influence and didn't put a lot of time into discussing the political history of the Iberian Peninsula.

While Andalusia was one of the centers of development of intellectual and artistic thought in the Medieval Era and a meeting point for the scholastic traditions of the three particular Abrahamic faiths, this does not mean there was not political drama even in this pluralistic environment. Rulers on both sides could and would exact ruthless vengeance on anyone they felt for whom they felt it necessary and were certainly not above sectarian violence. Even in Andalusia under Muslim rule, Christians could be executed if it was felt they publicly and shamelessly blasphemed the icons of the Muslim faith by the rulers there and the Muslim rulers weren't by any means averse to laying down their law on other Muslims in their territories who refused to obey them or followed an opposing Muslim ruler or sect. Insurrections, followed by bloody executions of dozens or even hundreds of people, were not any less uncommon in the lands ruled by the Muslims, Spain or elsewhere, than in the lands ruled by their Christian counterparts, and lands in Iberia re-conquered by Christians did experience ethnic cleansing of Muslims and Jews. It felt to me like some important characterization of the political powers active in Spain at the time was overlooked in the documentaries focus on intellectual personalities and its desire to craft a more uplifting narrative about opposing religions coming together.

But of course, that is a real charm of this documentary. This documentary isn't an overview of the political history of that region or time period. The facts it gives surrounding the political situations are basic and don't go into too much detail. While it doesn't deny what I've mentioned above at all, it just mentions such things in passing without going into them too much. And that's okay, because the documentary isn't about the political personalities or the violent intrigues between rival Muslim or Christian so much as it is about the positive cultural developments and the growth and preservation of the world's intellectual traditions by a combination of Muslim, Jewish and Christian thinkers and artists in or at least linked to the Andalusian area and its intellectual circles. The documentary only spends as much time on political personalities and events as is relevant to the emergence of intellectual thinkers such as Maimonides, Ibn Rushd or Thomas Aquinas, who are the real sort of star heroes of the documentary. The only times caliphs, emirs and kings (Christian or Muslim) are ever really given any serious attention is when a more critical historical event is concerned (such as Abdul Rahman I's rise to power, the Al-Mohad takeover, or the Spanish Inquisition) or they are mentioned when a particular leader was instrumental his or herself in facilitating the intellectual and cultural interaction between the three great religions (Abdul Rahman II's reign, which was marked with much rebellion and tension, and the events of his time are passed over, but Abdul Rahman III's part in the easing of some of those tensions and creating more unity between Iberia's faiths is given more considerable attention than his predecessor).

So, in short, if you are looking for a documentary on kings and wars and religious conflict, you might have better luck going elsewhere, but if you are interested in the history of the positive contributions to philosophy and the arts made by certain key figures across the three religions or if you want to learn more about those friendlier moments of cooperation and interaction between people of different faiths in Iberia (of which there no doubt were, as there were in many other parts of the world), moments which some who falsely portray the medievals as stupid, over-zealous primitives may think to have been impossible in those medieval days, then you will really enjoy this documentary as an introduction to the subject. I just would not limit the studies of medieval Iberia to this documentary and would recommend it as part of a broader, open-minded curriculum.",1346976000,,4618,5.105820105820106
3086197,4,B0012911D8,very interesting unfortunately it is not possible to watch it in Spain on the TV as it is only made for Stateside viewing.  Perhaps you could change that or at least write it on the information about the DVD. I watched it on my Computer.,1315612800,,237,4.266666666666667
3086198,1,B0012911D8,"Of course, it is good for westerners (or any culture) to see history presented from the perspective of another culture. But this fantasy is not in any way an objective or representative depiction of either the history of Spain or even of Al-Andalus. It is about as balanced and accurate as, say, 19thc western fantasies about ""progress"" and colonialism (or a Cecil B. DeMille epic depicting Middle Eastern history). Read a good book on the topic and skip this pretty but shallow, biased presentation.",1306195200,,500,4.964285714285714
3086199,5,B0012911D8,"Excellent documentary and a much needed lesson to learn from this documentary.

3086200,4,B0012911D8,"Although it doesn't say so, either on the screen credits or the package, this video uses a lot of material from the History Channel, and is of comparable quality.

What it describes is the Golden Age of Medieval Spain when Christians, Moslems and Jews lived together in harmony, resulting in a flowering of art and achitecture and substantial economic growth. Then Ferdinand and Isabella began their own reign of terror, kicking out the Muslims and Jews and initiating the Inquisition, and Spain (similar to Italy's experience post-Galileo) became a scientific and economic backwater.

The best part of this video is the scholarly commentary by experts from Catholic, Jewish, Muslim and non-sectarian institutions, effectively replicating the diversity and tolerance of Moorish Spain.

Highly recommended.

3320681,5,B0012911D8,"An excellent film in all senses of the word. It's extremely informative about an era of history about which most people understand little. The high production values are especially impressive. The film includes many re-enactment scenes that are very authentic-looking, better quality than what one typically sees on the History Channel. And the balance of scholars from the Islamic, Jewish, and Christian traditions yields a satisfyingly broad perspective. The only minor thing that detracts is that when the music or other sound is at a crescendo, it drowns out the narration, but this happens only briefly a half-dozen times or so.",1429056000,,633,5.2772277227722775

3320685,4,B0012911D8,"This is my first year teaching 7th grade history and since our textbook covers material very quickly and not in much depth, I am always looking for supplemental material.

This was perfect to help cover the chapters on Islamic history.  It provided wonderful detail, highlighted the architecture, and areas discussed and was at an appropriate level for my middle school students.  The only downside was that we were unable to access the captions.  I'm hard of hearing and my students kept asking me how to spell the names of people or to go back so that they could get the details right for their notes.  Without the closed captioning available, it made it difficult to provide accurate information to my students.

In addition, PBS on-line had a wonderful lesson plan to highlight the information.  My students enjoyed the film.  The only catch is that it is quite long.  With only a 45 minute class period, it took us over a week to view and discuss this one film.",1414713600,,966,4.7023809523809526

3320687,5,B0012911D8,"This is the most balanced and fair documentary I have ever seen on this subject. I use it every semester in my college level classes. All other programming I have ever found seems to want to follow the age-old story-line of how awful the Muslims were and how the Christians liberated Spain, when that isn't even remotely close to the truth. Even while getting my MA degree this period of history was mostly ignored by the department. I spent hours talking to my professors privately about it since for some reason schools don't seem to want to teach about the cultural Golden Age for Muslims and Jews and Andalusian Christians. Even outside of Spain this time is known as the Golden Age in Jewish and Islamic culture.

This video at least brings something to balance out 1000 years of bias.",1388361600,,790,4.642857142857143

3320690,5,B0012911D8,"Wonderful review of the period of Moorish rule in Spain and the many positive influences that Islam had on the peninsula itself and ultimately on Europe as a whole. The Muslims brought science, medicine, and a love of literature and the arts, things lost to Europe in the Dark Ages following the collapse of the Roman Empire.
Did this provide the seeds of the Renaissance?

The relative tolerance of Muslim rule and their equality of treatment of ""people of the book"" allowed harmony between Muslim, Christian and Jew, perhaps the only time and place this had occurred extensively. Could this lesson on tolerance be helpful in today's troubled times?",1370476800,,650,4.963302752293578
3320691,3,B0012911D8,"Too much Hollywood-style dramatization of events - especially battles, and not enough of the actual cities.

3320692,5,B0012911D8,"This film is a balanced overview of the history of Islam in Spain.  In fact, it provides an accurate historical account with the mostly positive contributions of Muslims to a civilized society and one which practiced tolerance for Jews and Christians.  At the same time, it does not overlook actions by a minority of extremists who sought to destroy tolerance at certain historical periods.  One must remember Islam existed in Spain for some 700-800 years.  I would recommend this film as a study tool for students of Islamic History in Spain.",1353628800,,543,4.934065934065934
3320693,4,B0012911D8,"First of all, this is a documentary that stands out for its cinematography and its editing. It's wonderfully crafted and feels very cinematic without coming off as gaudy or too Hollywood. The people who are interviewed are knowledgeable experts in their field and provide much insight into the historical facts that the documentary presents. The only thing that I felt held back the documentary was the fact that the film focused more on the utopian moments of cultural interaction and influence and didn't put a lot of time into discussing the political history of the Iberian Peninsula.

While Andalusia was one of the centers of development of intellectual and artistic thought in the Medieval Era and a meeting point for the scholastic traditions of the three particular Abrahamic faiths, this does not mean there was not political drama even in this pluralistic environment. Rulers on both sides could and would exact ruthless vengeance on anyone they felt for whom they felt it necessary and were certainly not above sectarian violence. Even in Andalusia under Muslim rule, Christians could be executed if it was felt they publicly and shamelessly blasphemed the icons of the Muslim faith by the rulers there and the Muslim rulers weren't by any means averse to laying down their law on other Muslims in their territories who refused to obey them or followed an opposing Muslim ruler or sect. Insurrections, followed by bloody executions of dozens or even hundreds of people, were not any less uncommon in the lands ruled by the Muslims, Spain or elsewhere, than in the lands ruled by their Christian counterparts, and lands in Iberia re-conquered by Christians did experience ethnic cleansing of Muslims and Jews. It felt to me like some important characterization of the political powers active in Spain at the time was overlooked in the documentaries focus on intellectual personalities and its desire to craft a more uplifting narrative about opposing religions coming together.

But of course, that is a real charm of this documentary. This documentary isn't an overview of the political history of that region or time period. The facts it gives surrounding the political situations are basic and don't go into too much detail. While it doesn't deny what I've mentioned above at all, it just mentions such things in passing without going into them too much. And that's okay, because the documentary isn't about the political personalities or the violent intrigues between rival Muslim or Christian so much as it is about the positive cultural developments and the growth and preservation of the world's intellectual traditions by a combination of Muslim, Jewish and Christian thinkers and artists in or at least linked to the Andalusian area and its intellectual circles. The documentary only spends as much time on political personalities and events as is relevant to the emergence of intellectual thinkers such as Maimonides, Ibn Rushd or Thomas Aquinas, who are the real sort of star heroes of the documentary. The only times caliphs, emirs and kings (Christian or Muslim) are ever really given any serious attention is when a more critical historical event is concerned (such as Abdul Rahman I's rise to power, the Al-Mohad takeover, or the Spanish Inquisition) or they are mentioned when a particular leader was instrumental his or herself in facilitating the intellectual and cultural interaction between the three great religions (Abdul Rahman II's reign, which was marked with much rebellion and tension, and the events of his time are passed over, but Abdul Rahman III's part in the easing of some of those tensions and creating more unity between Iberia's faiths is given more considerable attention than his predecessor).

So, in short, if you are looking for a documentary on kings and wars and religious conflict, you might have better luck going elsewhere, but if you are interested in the history of the positive contributions to philosophy and the arts made by certain key figures across the three religions or if you want to learn more about those friendlier moments of cooperation and interaction between people of different faiths in Iberia (of which there no doubt were, as there were in many other parts of the world), moments which some who falsely portray the medievals as stupid, over-zealous primitives may think to have been impossible in those medieval days, then you will really enjoy this documentary as an introduction to the subject. I just would not limit the studies of medieval Iberia to this documentary and would recommend it as part of a broader, open-minded curriculum.",1346976000,,4618,5.105820105820106
3320694,4,B0012911D8,very interesting unfortunately it is not possible to watch it in Spain on the TV as it is only made for Stateside viewing.  Perhaps you could change that or at least write it on the information about the DVD. I watched it on my Computer.,1315612800,,237,4.266666666666667
3320695,1,B0012911D8,"Of course, it is good for westerners (or any culture) to see history presented from the perspective of another culture. But this fantasy is not in any way an objective or representative depiction of either the history of Spain or even of Al-Andalus. It is about as balanced and accurate as, say, 19thc western fantasies about ""progress"" and colonialism (or a Cecil B. DeMille epic depicting Middle Eastern history).

3320697,4,B0012911D8,"Although it doesn't say so, either on the screen credits or the package, this video uses a lot of material from the History Channel, and is of comparable quality.

What it describes is the Golden Age of Medieval Spain when Christians, Moslems and Jews lived together in harmony, resulting in a flowering of art and achitecture and substantial economic growth. Then Ferdinand and Isabella began their own reign of terror, kicking out the Muslims and Jews and initiating the Inquisition, and Spain (similar to Italy's experience post-Galileo) became a scientific and economic backwater.

The best part of this video is the scholarly commentary by experts from Catholic, Jewish, Muslim and non-sectarian institutions, effectively replicating the diversity and tolerance of Moorish Spain.

Highly recommended.
