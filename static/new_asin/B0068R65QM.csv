8494911,5,B0068R65QM,I loved this picture it immediately became on of my favorite films.  A great cast of kooky characters....a film that is both funny and touching!,1376870400,,144,4.76
8494912,5,B0068R65QM,"Both guys and gals will enjoy this movie.  The three intersecting stories are sweet, humorous, touching, and entertaining.  John Putch's writing and directing coupled with the talents of an all-star cast make this 88 minutes worth watching.  (And the special features are a wonderful addition on this DVD.)",1347753600,,306,5.333333333333333
8494913,5,B0068R65QM,This is the epitome of an indie film. Three stories in one from an area near where I grew up...and I've always loved Dana Delaney!!!,1326153600,,132,4.32
8494914,5,B0068R65QM,"We showed Route 30 on a big screen at our house for friends last week, and everyone screamed with laughter! It's funny, smart, and completely heart-warming. It gives you a local-flavor of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania that has very little to do with the Civil War, and all to do with people arguing about getting shot in the but. Dana Delaney (Desperate Housewives, China Beach) stars as a cigarette-weilding, beer drinking Amish woman and David DeLuise (Wizards of Waverly Place) plays her ""supplier."" Curtis Armstrong (Booger from Revenge of the Nerds) and Kevin Rahm (Desperate Housewives) play deer hunters who refuse to shoot deer, except with a camera, and eventually stumble into Big Foot! The film also features Lee Wilkof, who played Seymour in the original Off-Broadway production of ""Little Shop of Horrors,"" and Natalie Boltt, who was in this summer's ""District 9.""

If you want to see a non-Hollywood, totally original movie, buy this one. It's amazing.",1321747200,,961,5.160256410256411
