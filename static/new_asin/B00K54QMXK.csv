6402892,5,B00K54QMXK,"Towards the end of the film, I found myself sitting in the theater, enraptured, and thoughtfully reflecting: I love this movie.

The Triumph is a bold film. It makes a lot of courageous choices, creating an original, edgy, and unapologetic experience at the cinema. Using fast-paced camera-work, unconventional angles, a thrilling sound-track, and vivid re-enactments of the first days of the apparitions (which have a touch of the whimsical to them, honoring the otherworldliness that is a mystical encounter), the documentary is a cool, stylish movie filled with raw energy, creativity, and an intensity that is often absent when it comes to films on spiritual matters.

I recall that when Randall Sullivan, as a secular journalist years ago working for RollingStone Magazine, began researching Medjugorje, he was critical of all the books that seemed like devotionalist drivel to him on the subject. Essentially, he ended up writing one of the best journalistic accounts of the apparitions ever written with The Miracle Detective: An Investigation of Holy Visions, a book that can appeal to both secular and religious audiences.

If we were to transfer the same perspective to films, you could say that the Triumph is anything but devotionalist drivel, having an appeal that could easily open the hearts and minds of a bigger  meaning both a secular and a younger  audience.

Worlds collide in this movie as if East meets West. The Triumph follows an American named Ben, a 28-year-old man - fun-loving, youthful, adventurous, filled with energy and life yet also a bit immature, vulnerable and tragicomic in so many ways, with a deep-seated emptiness and angst within his soul that the world cannot satisfy, searching for somethingsomething deeper.

Ben, who is struggling with addiction, ends up in Medjugorje in search of peace and inner freedom. At first, hes not sure whether he believes in the supernatural experiences of the visionaries or not. Receiving an invitation to be present at the apparition of visionary Mirjana Soldo, who is a reoccurring and powerful presence throughout the film, Bens ambiguous faith is testedwith monumental results.

A climactic moment comes in the film when Ben gets a chance to sit down and speak with Mirjana; a beautiful and priceless encounter. The reality of polar opposites coming face-to-face is evident here, as Ben, who in many ways resembles a Johnny-Knoxville- MTV-generation type faces the Slavic visionary who experiences monthly visits from the Mother of God. Of course, what is most endearing is Mirjanas obvious normalcy.

The authenticity of her joy, her sense of humor, the sincerity of her faith, her wisdom and spiritual motherhood, are all conveyed in this exchange in the most human and natural ways, beyond the grasp that any interview (no matter how thoughtful or sincere) could capture. Few things are as revealing as the sublime intimacy of two human beings spontaneously conversing with each other.

This is a scene that speaks wonders to Medjugorjes authenticity through Mirjanas witness; watch it, watch the way she treats, and interacts with, Bennotice the depth of goodness, empathy, genuine interest, appreciation and joy that emanates from this visionaryyou see an encounter which behind the mask of simplicity uncovers the depths of holiness in various ways. It is a pleasure and an honor to watch.

One of the most fascinating portrayals in the Triumph is how well the film depicts the struggle with addiction, a reality addressed by a psychiatrist, by priests, by a visionary, and by an addict, as well as numerous recovering (or recovered) addicts, in the film.

One of my favorite interviews came from Dr. James Paul Pandarakalam, a U.K. psychiatrist who has published scientific papers on the events in Medjugorje, personally examining the ecstasies of the visionaries. Dr. Pandarakalam also spoke eloquently of addiction, making a fascinating comparison between chemical and spiritual solutions, examining how human beings yearn for a higher state of consciousness  for a purer and deeper state  and often succumb to chemical methods (drugs or alcohol) in attempts to reach such a state when they should, in fact, be seeking the true solution: spiritual methods (an encounter with God, with the interior life, with true peace and freedom).

These are deep, fascinating and important issues which are seldom addressed so purely and eloquently. It made me think of a few things. Consider that one of the 12 Steps to Recovery in the Alcoholics Anonymous program is a spiritual experience  monumental for the conversion to transpire. Consider that Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa, the papal preacher and such a holy man, writes of the deeper encounter with the Holy Spirit  an encounter of pure experientialism with the divine  using the language of sober intoxication (again, a state of intoxication - but spiritual, not chemical; thus truer).

It made me reflect about how when I first wrote an article sharing my testimony of my past struggles with addiction, and the liberating consolation and freedom that I found in faith, I originally titled the article In Search of Ecstasy. For me, as for so many countless others, the deeper ecstasy came when the experience of God came into my life. That is when a higher state of consciousness, an intimate mystical reality allowing one to find freedom and empowerment, penetrates our lives: when we give ourselves to the Lord and develop a meaningful, growing relationship with Him, one of constant conversion and interior depth.

Sean Bloomfield is no stranger to such a reality, as I read before the screening how he went through a period of alcohol abuse in college before discovering a life of faith and meaning in God through Our Ladys apparitions. The filmmaker thus is no stranger to the seriousness of the situation that his art depicts through this powerful documentary.

I was also glad to see that the Triumph does not shy away from the anthropological situation surrounding the history of Medjugorje and the other regions of the former Yugoslavia, as being areas of historic (and horrific) conflict between Croatian Catholics, Serbian Orthodox Christians and Muslims. Here Ben (as the films protagonist) plays a double-role.

Beyond being the subject of the movie Ben becomes a facilitator (almost an MC, of sorts) who conducts interviews with Serbian Orthodox priests at a monastery and with Muslims at a mosque, entering these sacred places of worship and becoming an actor in the play, so to speak, as the camera follows him and records his exposure to these sites and the inter-religious encounters that come with themencounters which ultimately are able to balance moments of the solemn with the comic, presenting a perfect paradox that is so often experienced with experimental efforts at ecumenism and with an encounter with sacred joy, which frequently arrives as a result of such efforts.

The Triumph is a different film, unique from any other Medjugorje film. Theres an emphasis on the youth. Theres great emphasis on the annual Youth Festival in Medjugorje and on the joy and spiritual freedom that so many young people meet there. Theres emphasis on the struggle with substance abuse that so many young people encounter throughout the world, and also a great depiction of the Cenacolo Community in Medjugorje which helps young addicts overcome that which enslaves them. Theres emphasis on the inter-religious importance of all that Medjugorje represents, as the Queen of Peace introduced herself as a Mother of all people, not just Catholics. Theres striking emphasis on the severity of the Medjugorje secrets and world events which vividly speak of how far humanity has gone from God, conveying the urgency of the situation in an electrifying wake-up call.

The most original thing about this film is its style. As mentioned, it has a very edgy, fast-paced style that is intense, energy-driven, and free of any restrictive boundaries underwritten by conventional filmmaking. I like to think that when dealing with such edgy and intense issues like addiction, mysticism, and a world in need of spiritual transformation, then its not a bad idea to take such an innovative and electric path in conveying the realities depicted. So many young people, and so many in the secular world especially, will relate well to how this is done. Judging by his testimony, I think Sean Bloomfield has a gift for connecting with (and evangelizing) such audiences. This movie  and its spreading  makes an important contribution to efforts in the new evangelization.",1435795200,10,8589,5.170028818443804
6402893,5,B00K54QMXK,This film is amazing!!!!  I saw it in the theatre and had to own it.  It is wonderful in so many ways.  I love it that it tells a personal story but it is also an incredible movie about the Church.  This film left me feeling so hopeful and proud.

improvement..",1428019200,2,452,3.768421052631579
6402897,4,B00K54QMXK,"This was an excellent documentary. It really told the story of a young man's struggle for Truth, hope, and healing against the modern world's allurements. It's a great movie to help young people (and older) who are going through similar experiences that we all can identify with. This movie is more about a personal conversion story as opposed to a movie all about Medjugorje although they do touch on various topics like the messages, the secrets, etc. I think some parts could have been edited out and I would have liked to have seen more footage actually about Medjugorje. The re-enactments were a little silly but overall this is a wonderful film. I think it's a great tool of evangelization to share with others. It really gets to the heart of what Medjugorje is all about!",1424131200,,778,4.727941176470588

8655875,3,B00K54QMXK,"I have been to Medjugorje, I have read many books and have seen many films about it. For me, this one was not worth the cost. I could not relate to the young man who was the star of the film. He was so self absorbed and asked so many irrelevant questions. He was a young man of either no faith or little faith who was seeking something - I am not sure he knew what he was seeking. I saw no transformation in him. The experience did not seem to affect him in any way other than to be more confused than he was at the start of the film. His 2 week binge at the end was shocking. That he went back to rehab and was still there 2 years later tells me he had still not found the answers he was seeking. What was special about the film was seeing Mirjana and listening to her. I was also brought up to date on what has happened in the area since I was there pre-Bosnian war. I was pleased to see all was a peaceful and prayerful as when I was there. The place remains simple and God-centered.",1490313600,3,986,3.935

More subtitles would be helpful.",1456704000,,174,5.214285714285714
8655881,5,B00K54QMXK,"At first I thought this documentary could not decide what it wanted to be.  But the more I watched, the more I got into it.  It is not your typical Medjugorje documentary in that it is not presented in a structured, highly spiritual and informational way as most documentaries.  That being said, it may be the most honest and effective documentary for young people with addiction issues as well as for anyone questioning their faith.  Like many of us, the main character seeks, questions, opens his heart, becomes a believer then runs in the opposite direction. (Rinse and repeat).  Seriously, Medjugorje is a gift to us all.  Whether we accept that gift is up to us.  It is a lifetime journey and going to Medjugorje can be the journey of a lifetime.",1454544000,2,751,4.643939393939394
