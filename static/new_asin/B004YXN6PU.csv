But this one with Seu Jorge, when they were younger, is very sweet and personable..Brazilian popular music (MPB) is often overlooked by the US public because of the language barrier, but much of it is better than today's American pop music. It's not all samba or what we call bossa nova.  AC is a Brazilian treasure. I wish she would come to the US again.",1488240000,,393,4.444444444444445

It is absolutely brilliant. So many track on there that is not on the album. Beautifully shot, the dvd is good clarity. Sure to be one of my favourites.

Thank you!",1389225600,,329,4.061538461538461
8449040,5,B004YXN6PU,"This is by far one of the best music DVD's I have ever had the pleasure of watching and owning. The DVD is a recording of a live performance by the 2 vocal/ instrumental masters Ana Carolina and Seu Jorge. The DVD includes wonderful additional scenes from before and after the show, including a get together in a typical local Brasilian bar after the show, filled with spontaneous singing and playing by the two artists and their friends.

The show includes long solo segments by each one of the artists, starting with Jorge and ending with Ana Carolina. The mid-segment is where the show comes to a climax with an incredible live collaboration between the two artists. Both artists play various guitars as well as bass and percussion. On several songs, a cello player joins them, and on one song Jorge plays clarinet as Ana Carolina plays guitar and sings. One of the most exciting songs starts with virtuoso bass playing by Ana Carolina, of an incredibly complex and somewhat funky bass line, to which she adds complex and intense melody. Jorge joins in harmonizing with his perfectly matching voice and playing his guitar, to form an intense musical experience.

The skills and musicianship level of these two performers, is world class. The level of the compositions and arrangements does not fall behind either. I highly recommend this DVD.",1188518400,3,1345,4.868995633187773
