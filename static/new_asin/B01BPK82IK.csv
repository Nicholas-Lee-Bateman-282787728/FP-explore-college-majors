8750997,4,B01BPK82IK,"First of all you get your money's worth on this with 12 DVDs.  The presentation by John Stoneman and explanation of underwent life, shipwrecks, etc is very interesting.

HOWEVER:  Don't expect the same quality as say Blue Planet.  This apparently was made before advanced technology in underwater photography and tho it may have been great at the time now the quality is lacking.  Brilliantly colored fish and coral are dull and some shots look fuzzy and blurred.  Reds run together.  So if you're expecting top quality you'll be disappointed.  If you're willing to overlook the above you'll get a lot of ""bang for the buck.""",1469318400,,625,4.885714285714286
8750998,4,B01BPK82IK,The material in these videos is quite interesting and there's lots of it. The picture quality is vintage. Made before the days of high definition. Probably would look better on a small screen.,1463702400,2,192,4.848484848484849
