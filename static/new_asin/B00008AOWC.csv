1834324,5,B00008AOWC,I have waited anxoiusly for this movie to be released.  One of the funniest movies you will ever see.  You will be quoting lines from this movie forever. Tinker and Junior make this movie. I promise you'll love it....a can't miss.,1045094400,,230,4.585365853658536
1834325,4,B00008AOWC,"Lone Star State Of Mind is an intelligent and hysterical comedy.  Joshua Jackson as well as Ryan Hurst kept me laughing throughout the entire movie.  If you are a fan of quirky comedy this film will keep your eyes glued to the screen.  Interesting, original, and by far one of the best movies to come out of 2002.",1043712000,2,313,4.362068965517241
1834326,5,B00008AOWC,This is no doubt hands down the FUNNIEST movie I'be ever seen. It's a family favorite!!! Would love to have sound track.,1509148800,,120,4.5
1834327,5,B00008AOWC,If you don't laugh in the 1st 5 minutes.. Just turn it off. You have no sense of humor & this will go right over your head somehow. Just a fun movie that everyone I've lent it to has enjoyed.,1506297600,,191,3.8

1834331,5,B00008AOWC,"This movie had me laughing from start to finish. It has fast become on of my families favorites.... cause I aint stupid. You can tell when my family has set down and watched this again as the quips from the film are flying!
I can honestly say it will have you laughing in the first 5 minutes of the movie. If your in need of a good laugh... take a chance and get this. It wasn't highly marketed so I didn't even know about it till a friend recommended it to me. My family has loved it and to be honest... I prob need to order a second copy in case something happens to the first.",1498867200,,579,4.0

1834333,5,B00008AOWC,"""Never pop your bubble gum in a stand off lest you start the gunfight"" - that's the take away life lesson from this awesome movie. I absolutely love this movie, it's one of the few that I'm willing to watch every time it shows up on cable. I laugh out loud every single time.

Growing up in small town Texas means we know the vernacular and dialogue throughout the movie and it's true enough to be hysterically funny. I swear, we know a Junior and a Baby - actual names. The characters are just over the top enough to skip campy and roll right into great. There's real chemistry among the cast and the riffing back and forth feels natural more than scripted. Tinker is played to perfection with surprisingly precise comedic timing - like old school slap stick used to be. This is clean enough that I have watched it with my 12 year old nephew and now he greets me with ""Didn't I already kill you once, boy??!!"" Gotta love a comedy connection like that.",1496275200,,952,4.378531073446328

1834361,5,B00008AOWC,"Starts out hilarious and ends up hilarious. Tinker (Ryan Hurst) does comedy so surprisingly well, his timing is spot on. His line ""I'm gonna kill you Earl"" is delivered throughout the movie; never the same way twice but always perfect for the context of the scene. The casting of this movie was genius. The drug lords are overdone in a just enough of a hammy way as to add to the fun. Even the killer stalker ends up on a funny note. This is one of my all time favorite movies. P.S. I live in Texas and I can see it really happening here.",1471651200,,538,4.1826923076923075

1834490,4,B00008AOWC,"This is a simple ""good ol' boy movie and even if you aren't really into this type of movie you should watch it anyway...just for the fun of it.  It's a no-brainer and when you finish watching, I can promise you won't have any philosophical questions haunting you or be afraid of being home alone.  :) The cast does an excellent job and THEY ARE the characters they play...very believable.

Earl (Joshua Jackson) and Baby (Jamie King), are engaged and live in their parents house.  They are step-brother and sister and Earl gets really annoyed when anyone calls her his sister, especially when he is kissing her.  :)

The story takes place in a small town in Texas and begins with Tinker (an ex-con) and Junior (a rather stupid cousin to Baby, Earl's girlfriend) robbing a pizza delivery guy.  They unwittingly strike it rich when they find the black tote contains $20,000 and 3 large bags of cocaine.

Tinker makes arrangements to sell the stuff to Juan Vasquez and his boys.  But before he can finalize the deal Junior grudgingly tells Earl (while embraced in a headlock) what he and Tinker have done.

Earl and Junior go to Tinkers house, where Earl takes the bag of 'stuff', then proceeds to hide it at the bowling alley until the real ""owners"" come for it (basically to protect Junior, who he can't stand but looks out for because he is under orders from Baby.)

Tinker already has it in for Earl because he botched a get-away after holding up a liquor store, so he goes to Earl's house to try get info about the hiding place.  Earl tells him nothing, that is, until Baby comes around a corner which gives Tinker the leverage he needs to get his 'stuff' back!  After getting his 'stuff' Tinker stops the truck and shoots Earl (not fatally).  Baby backs the truck over him and takes Earl to the animal doctor.  :)

Juan Vasquez threatens Junior and wants the stuff, so Junior and Earl go to give it back (not knowing that these gentlemen are not the true owners).  There is a shortage in the money, so long story short Junior loses his ""pinkie"" finger.

Junior shows up at Earl's house all beat up and says the real owners want THEIR 'stuff'.  So Earl, Jimbo (Earl's homosexual best friend), Junior, and Tinker go to Juan's house with heavy artillery to get the 'stuff' which they take to a rich guy (the real owner) in a huge ranch house.  While there Earl get's a phone call that Juan has kidnapped Baby and he wants the 'stuff'!!!!  So they head back to the wearhouse, but so does the rich guy.  A big gunfight ensues, baby is rescued, and the bad guys are either killed or injured!

On the way back to the car, after the gunfight, Junior accidentally shoots Earl in the leg.  Tinker, in damaged condition from being backed over by the truck, is on the ground after threatening Earl for umpteenth time.  They leave him with the 3 bags of cocaine.  :)

Earl and Baby split the money with friends and family and literally head into the sunset to their new life in Los Angeles.  :)

My pick for the most amusing scenes:  When Tinker and Junior are planning the pizza guy robbery and they wear Maxi Pads for masks and when Tinker is trying to get Earl to tell him where the 'stuff' is.  :) :) :)

1834501,2,B00008AOWC,"So, I first saw this movie upon the request of my boyfriend, who like me, lives in Texas. It's not an awful movie, it has a few spurts of comedy, but for the most part it's just one cheesey cliche moment after the other.

And I'm also worried that out-of-state viewers of this film (though God knows why they would want to watch it in the first place) might get the wrong impression of Texas. It's not just a bunch of BBQ joints and bars and boots and cowboys. Sure, we've got it all, but this movie makes it seem like California is salvation in comparison.

The acting was not terrible. The script was less-than-clever, and an actor can only do so much with what he's given. But accents go in and out a bit, and it just wasn't entertaining. It was cute at best.

She said it was the funniest thing she's ever seen and I said ""Joshua Jackson, funny?"" and she said ""JUST WATCH IT""...and she was right...this movie is downright histerical. Earl (Jackson) is engaged to his step-sister Baby (Jamie King, the hot former model) who is determined to be a soap star and thus is intent on moving to LA.  They live in some rinky dink Texas town.  Baby has a wayward cousin Junior (DJ Qualls) who she entrusts Earl to keep an eye on, but Junior is almost more trouble than Earl can chew.  You see junior and his delinquent friend Tinker (Ryan Hurst from Remember the Titans) just robbed a pizza delivery boy, the only problem is that he wasn't a pizza delivery boy, but more like a drug runner for some important coke dealers and now Tinker and Junior (mostly junior) find themselves in deep $hit when these men want their drugs and money back.  Earl then enlists the help of his gay best friend Jimmy (Matthew Davis) to help him deliver the goods that Tinker won't hand over.  Problem after problem arises and someone loses a pinky finger resulting in some of the funniest dialog in movie history.  I'm a huge fan of this film.  The cast is spot on, and even though Jackson isn't funny in this movie (he's the serious hero type who hardly cracks a smile) the rest of the cast, including John Mellencamp as Earls hilarious stepfather (Baby's father), is downright brilliant!",1144108800,9,1475,4.5606060606060606

Maybe you have to be from Texas, but I bought this DVD the day it came out, and never tire of watching it. And as far as what have been called ""lame stereotypes"" of Southern people? Apparently you've never ventured into ANY of the small towns that make up not only Texas, but most of the South. No, all people from the South aren't idiots and screw-ups. Quite the contrary, most people in the South are very intelligent. They just don't feel the constant need to prove it to the World on a daily basis. The point is this is a ""silly"" comedy, and if you don't find that kind of stuff funny you won't like this movie.

The ""comedy,"" if you really want to call it that, is beyond juvenile... and not even the funny juvenile humor that makes other movies good.

1834513,5,B00008AOWC,"Definitely give this movie a try.

It's stupid and definitely cheezy, but very funny in many parts. Dont rent this and expect the story to be extremely serious and don't expect it to go by the rules cause it doesn't. Just go with it's flow and you'll laff. Definitely have the popcorn out for this.

It's a story about Earl Crest (Joshua Jackson who plays Pacey on Dawson's Creek) who's engaged to a beautiful cow girl named Baby (Jamie King). Her cousin Junior (DJ Qualls who plays in The New Guy) is a moron and Earl always has to watch over him. Well Junior always hangs around another moron named Tinker (Ryan Hurst who played in Remember the Titans, who is ABSOLUTELY tear-jerking hilarious in this movie). Tinker is ALWAYS looking for trouble and finding it. Him and Junior really screw up trying to rob a pizza delivery boy. Come to find out, they steal a lot of drugs and a lot of money from some big time drug dealers. Earl finds out and tries to get Junior out of trouble by trying to return the drugs, all while not letting Baby find out what's going on. From the beginning to the end, the movie is full of laughs and even some crazy plot twists. This is just a really fun movie.",1097107200,5,1190,4.3558558558558556

They make plans to go to Hollywood so Baby (girlfriend) can become an actress.  Due to a promise that Earl has made to Baby to help her cousin Junior, Earl gets himself in hot water.

Geez, I couldn't believe they robbed the dude at gunpoint while he was making his rounds. (He has to make an honest living like the rest of us.) As for the film's premise, it centers around the miracle of forgiveness. The moral of the story: Lending a willing heart to forgive your enemy of their trespasses.

1834523,2,B00008AOWC,"Featuring:  Jamie King, Joshua Jackson, John Mellencamp
Rating:  ** (not the worst, but not good)
This movie was a little shy of average.  It certainly had it's moments though, one being Jamie King's portrayal of the lead female character, Baby.  She shined as both the sensitive and driven young waif.  As well as showing the flashes of anger that result if you cross her or her loved ones.  Joshua Jackson did a fine job as the lead male character of Earl.
In a nutshell, Earl and Baby are planning on moving from small town Texas to big L.A. when all hell breaks loose around them.  Nutty relatives, drug dealers, two-bit criminals and stupid folks abound.  Through it all Earl, the normal one, and Baby, the sexy one, keep plugging away trying to move forward in their lives and help the ones they love.
Although it had a lot of cliches and was at times stupid there are worse ways to spend an evening than watching this movie.  Jamie Kind is the one that kept this movie from a one star rating (don't bother).  If you rent it, it should be for her performance alone.",1068508800,7,1071,4.474226804123711

This movie is lighthearted and good entertainment. I was pleasantly suprised.",1066176000,,413,5.0

I can't even tell if she's a good actress or not, because I can't think of anything other than how incredibly good looking she is. Jaime King has won my heart.

Lone Star State of Mind is one of those movies that forces you to take the giant stick out of your butt and stop looking so hard for reasons to hate a movie.  The movie opens with two mentally incapacitated criminals, and i use the term loosely, robbing a pizza delivery guy with maxi pads on their faces, like not so fresh superheros.  Sure, DJ Qualls and Joshua Jackson shined in this movie.  Sure, Jamie King is probably one of the most gorgeous woman alive.  But people, lest we forget the true star of this movie.  One word.  Tinker.  Ryan Hurst deserves some sort of medal for his acting in this should-have-been blockbuster.  Tinker is the kind of character that makes watching movies not only enjoyable, but necessary, just to make it through the day alive.  I have to admit, when I saw Hurst in Remember the Titans, he was barely memorable.  But his role in Lone Star will most definitely earn him a place in my list of most memorable movie characters.  I suggest a sequel in which only Tinker stars.  That's it.  No Earl, no Junior, no Baby, okay maybe Baby.  All in all, Lone Star State of Mind is an indy gem, and deserves to be credited as such.

7981403,5,B00008AOWC,"Hands down, the best aspect is the amazing, natural chemistry between Joshua Jackson (Earl) and Jaime King (Baby).  I also enjoyed all the supporting actors - Ryan Hurst, John Mellencamp, DJ Qualls, and Matthew Davis.  The comedic timing is spot-on in the characters of Junior, Jimbo, and Tinker.  Unfortunately the awesome Thomas Haden Church was saddled (heehee) with a terribly written side story/character that added nothing to the movie.

The only other thing I had seen Jackson in was Dawson's Creek and although this seemed to be a non-challenging role for him, he was definitely charming and likeable.  The real surprise for me was the lovely Ms. King whom I knew as a model but never an actor.  She played Baby perfectly:  down-home and sassy and in love and tough and winsome and sexy-sweet.
