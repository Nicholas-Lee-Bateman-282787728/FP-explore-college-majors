8327122,2,B001NH4CE4,"First off I am a big fan of grade Z trashy films of the 1970s, I like beat up old prints and am not by any means a demanding stickler for sharp and perfectly clear film restoration. I've also enjoyed many of 42nd Street Pete's vintage stag films and sex loops in the past. I've been wanting to add some Uschi Digard films to my collection for a while now and this disc has her name and face all over it. I figured given what I'd seen from After Hours Cinema in the past this would be just the thing to expand my ever growing vintage sleaze collection. As expected Pete comes on with his usual introductions, sitting behind a movie projector with rolls of film sitting around, giving some informative tidbits about the history of Times Square theaters, more specifically the make shift store front theaters that showed these type of 16mm sex films. He explains to us that these films usually ran about an hour long and that since there are three of them included on the disc (I found it strange that a two disc set with three movies had all three on the first disc, even if only an hour a piece) along with the extras we were in for well over three hours worth of entertainment. Nothing could be further from the truth. Two of the three movies here, Marriage American Style and Bull's Market, clock in at around 37 minutes each. The other film, Love Me Or Leave Me, can't be any more than about 50 minutes long. And that's with Pete's intros attached to each one. Watching these films they are obviously missing entire reels and you get the feeling that After Hours tacked on some of the exterior transitional shots themselves from other films so things seem to make a little more sense, which they rarely do. Marriage American Style even has a newly added text insert explaining the plot of the film (after Pete has done so already) because it's obvious not enough of the film survives to make heads or tails out of it. The plots are explained yet again in the booklet that's included. Right away you know something's wrong when during the opening credits we are informed of the enhanced edition being copyrighted. It's obvious what is meant by ""enhanced""; terrible music has been dubbed in. I thought this was fine for the 8mm sex loops as they are silent anyway, but for these films it's hard enough to hear what anyone is saying on these beat up old prints as it is, you dub droning music into it and forget it, you can hardly understand a single word. As far as Uschi Digard is concerned we get to see her for the first 15 minutes or so of Marriage American Style and that's about it, which is pretty much the only scene that's enjoyable on this entire set. Most of the women here are dog meat so don't expect to be turned on in the least watching these. On the second disc Pete insults us further by giving us a ""handful"" of sex loops. My math is not very good but I think I'm smart enough to know that a handful means at least four or five and not TWO which is the exact number we're given here. And they run about five minutes each. Other special features include trailers to Bavarian sex comedies most of us have already seen on other After Hours DVDs, and a few minutes of audience participation at one of Pete's porn screenings (none of which are the ones included on these collection, everyone would have wanted their money back) in a movie theater, which are fun, but could have been a lot longer. We never get any audience reaction either during or after the screening of the films which was what I was hoping for. These weren't just sleazy old men either there were lots of 20 something women present to see vintage porn up on the big screen. All in all disc 2 feels pretty pointless, as a dual layer DVD will hold over six hours of footage and disc 2 is maybe a half hour total. In other words it all would have fit fine on one disc. Pete in his introductions also has the gall to tell us his is the best company for grindhouse porno. I think companies like Something Weird, VCX and the new wunderkind of clear, widescreen, 2K porn transfers Vinegar Syndrome might have some dispute with him on that point. I can't say I'm totally put off 42nd Street Pete for good after viewing this collection, but I'll be approaching any further After Hours discs with a lot more caution in the future.",1444608000,,4303,4.386733416770964
8327123,3,B001NH4CE4,Have to say this film really bombed and it was not even worth the price that they charge really stupid film. I'm not even the only one who has said this but i was dissapointed seeing that the other classics are really good at times guess depends on what it is i guess. I never even got disc one only disc 2 on the inside have to get again hopefully this time its right.,1368057600,,369,4.0

8327125,5,B001NH4CE4,"This is one of the very rare movies made in the old golden days of sexploitation, and before the rating,It is full of nudity, and sexuality, and mostly the natural women breasts, and I think it is worth what you pay for it.",1315440000,3,223,4.209302325581396
