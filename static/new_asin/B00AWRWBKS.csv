5524693,5,B00AWRWBKS,"Tabatacise is one of my favorites from the Xtrain series.  It is an extremely versatile DVD.

There are 5 rounds of Tabatas.  Each round lasts 4 minutes (20 seconds of Max intensity work, 10 seconds of rest .. for 8 rounds), then Cathe challenges you with a 'Recovery Blast'.  Well, according to my heart rate, it isn't much of a recovery.

If you are a beast, then perhaps you do all 5 Tabata's.  If you are like me, you start with one and work your way up.  Right now I am at doing 3 at a time.  They are intense.

I love also being able to add on a Tabata when I have shorter workout days.  I skip the warm up, since I'm coming off another workout, and just go straight into the Tabata.  4-ish minutes later, I've blasted my heart rate through the roof, sweated enough to soak the clothes, and burnt off a few extra calories.

If you are curious what the calorie burn will be, I did two tabatas in around 22 minutes and burned 200 calories for my weight and height.",1386633600,2,968,4.172972972972973
5524694,4,B00AWRWBKS,"I enjoy the workout, it was definitely what I was looking for.  This is a great Tabata work out DVD",1379980800,,99,3.95
5524695,4,B00AWRWBKS,"I am really happy I got this DVD. I love tabatacise cardio and have been a fan of Amy DIxon's two Breathless Body workouts as well as Cathe Friedrich's other tabatacise like dvd. I really liked how this one has the short high intensity intervals than the step section for the recovery. The options are nice also. I like to do the 5 tabatacise followed by the abs section for a good 55 minute workout.

I have not yet tried the back section. I did go to it today just to see what it was like. I was disappointed that it looked like very heavy weight use and I don't have weights over 15 pounds at home. So I am not sure I will be able to make a lot of use out of this section. Otherwise, I think the workout is fantastic and will make good use of it.",1378166400,,749,3.993333333333333
5524696,5,B00AWRWBKS,"Don't expect Cathe to go easy on you. The tabata workouts give you a great workout. Cathe puts a lot of effort in creating new moves and combinations, so this is also good for the brain.",1373673600,,186,4.194444444444445
5524697,5,B00AWRWBKS,"I've worked out for the last 10 years rather consistently. I've done most of the Beachbody programs, step aerobics, elliptical, and I jog occasionally. I was looking for a new program because I could tell that I wasn't challenged the way I should be.  I was getting through really difficult workouts without feeling it much.  Enter Xtrain Tabatacise: The first day I tried it, I thought I was coming down with the flu or something because I couldn't make it through the first one let alone 5 of them.  I had to take breaks and I had to stop before she reached the count of 20 and try to catch up on the next set.  Then I realized that this was going to be hard. I mean really hard.  I'm happy to say, I am now up to 3 tabatas at a time, but it took time.  I plan to try to incorporate the 4th soon, as I can't hide from it any longer.  I really feel a sense of accomplishment with this set. I can honestly say, it's the most challenging thing I've ever done, and that alone makes it worth the money and worth my time.  Love it!",1372291200,17,1027,4.1
5524698,5,B00AWRWBKS,"This is one tough workout. I love Cathe's HIIT style workouts, and this one is one of the best. It's a serious calorie burner. I am sucking wind all the way through. And, I love how you can customize it to your level of fitness by adjusting how many rounds of the tabatas you do. Once again, a fabulous workout from Cathe! It's a must have to add to your Cathe/fitness DVD collection.",1371081600,8,384,4.273972602739726
5524699,4,B00AWRWBKS,Cathe is a great instructor and presenter.  All the exercises are explained and great detail and the workout is very challenging.  Another hard workout from a great teacher.,1368144000,,173,5.142857142857143
5524700,5,B00AWRWBKS,Love this DVD when I need to workout at home. Great workout with minimal extra equipment required. Only a step is needed:-),1366329600,2,123,4.636363636363637
5524701,5,B00AWRWBKS,"This is one of the toughest DVDs from Cathe Friedrich's Xtrain series.  Tabata is a form of high intensity interval training. Each set is usually 4 minutes long with 20 seconds of very intense training, 10 seconds of rest, done for 8 rounds.  If you do Tabatas 1 -5, plus warm-up and cool down, the workout is about 45 minutes.

I have yet to do any of Cathe's Xtrain rotations, since I'm in the midst of an Insanity rotation, but I was dying to try the Xtrains, so I've incorporated them into my latest rotation.  Even after 2 months of Insanity, this workout was hard for me.

A step with two risers is the only equipment you'll need.

Why I enjoyed this workout:

* The versatility.  Not only can you do 1 to 5 of the Tabata routines, but there are also lots of premixes to choose from.  My favorite is Tabatas 1-5, Burn Sets Back and Core #2.  This workout clocks in at about 70 minutes.  All I can say is ouch!  (In a good way, of course.)

* The music fit the workout.  Normally I don't like Cathe's taste in music, but this time I was enjoying the workout so much, or rather I was so busy gasping for air that I didn't really notice the music, except for the driving beat.  I really need that driving beat to get me through a tough workout.

* The extra-long and thorough warm-up.  Your muscles and joints really need to be ready for this intense workout.

* The variety of Tabata routines.  I loved how some moves and routines were easier than others.  It gave me a chance to catch my breath and get re-focused on giving it my all.

I would caution that this workout is not for beginners.  This is one tough workout!  I am also not sure how one could modify this to be low impact.

I highly recommend Tabatacise for anyone wanting to increase their stamina and have fun!  Even if you only have 20 minutes or so, you can benefit from this workout.",1363651200,24,1854,4.258620689655173
5524702,5,B00AWRWBKS,This is a great DVD if you are already fit and need to up your game!  Very motivating! Cathe's voice is always so calm!,1361059200,,119,3.9583333333333335
5524703,5,B00AWRWBKS,This one will leave you breathless even if you are an advanced exerciser.,1425600000,,73,4.6923076923076925

5524705,5,B00AWRWBKS,So glad I bought it to add to my collection of workout dvds.,1421798400,,60,3.6923076923076925
5524706,5,B00AWRWBKS,"I am an advanced exerciser and love to be worked hard by the likes of Insanity or Jillian Michaels. This DVD doesn't disappoint! It has five tabata workouts and I do them all and then do one of the abs sections. There is a step section at the end of each workout but I just mimic the step exercises as I don't have a step. This has improved my fitness no end and when I am doing a phsical activity like working or running, I don't get out of breath half as much as I used to. Cathe is fanatastic as a trainer and I am fairly new to her DVDs. I only wished I had discovered her years ago, I actually prefer her to JM!!",1421366400,7,617,3.9047619047619047

5524708,5,B00AWRWBKS,Cathe F always gives a great workout.  No exception here.  Great video.  I'm a fitness instructor and always looking for new moves.  This one is great.,1411689600,2,151,4.6923076923076925
5524709,5,B00AWRWBKS,I just started instructing a tabata class.  This cd is tough --- love it.,1411603200,,73,4.214285714285714
5524710,5,B00AWRWBKS,"As always all of the Cathe Friedrich videos that I owned are great. The XTrain Tabatacise dvd is definitely intense. When I first did the dvd I was able to get through the 1st three tabatas. Now I can do all 5, but I am thoroughly drenched when I am finish. I also do the bonus core part of the dvd. As always Cathe is an excellent instructor, her cueing is superb and I will continue to purchase her dvds.",1410220800,3,406,4.0875
5524711,5,B00AWRWBKS,Very good workout! I thought I was in pretty good shape. This one kicked my butt :),1405641600,,83,3.9411764705882355
5524712,5,B00AWRWBKS,"I love this workout!  I don't like the kinds of tabata routines that repeat the same exercise or exercise set too many times.  Cathe does a set of four twice, and then moves on to the next set.  I also really like the active recovery, rather than just marching in place.  It's perfect!",1404086400,6,285,4.320754716981132
5524713,4,B00AWRWBKS,They drills are great . The two sections of ab work are not working properly so I do not have that. Did not discover in time to return . Cathe is one of the hardest trainers and I have many DVDs and have been doing this for a long time and find it hard to find anything that challenges me.,1399593600,,289,3.8333333333333335
5524714,5,B00AWRWBKS,"I am a regular of P90X.  I wanted something different.  Consider myself to be ""fit"".  I researched and read reviews then decided to go with Cathe.  I have never done or even heard of Tataba.  It is truly a pulse raising, sweat dripping, work out!  Yes for this 53 yr old It took a couple of times to get some of the steps down smoothly BUT it is worth it.  I love this work out.  I love Cathe!  I wish today that I had learned of her years ago. This is exactly what I was needing.  I still love Tony Horton and P90X but this has given my muscles a new jump.  I am only in my 2nd week but I can feel that I will be seeing changes very soon!  I am very pleased I made the purchase.",1397433600,25,679,3.805755395683453
5524715,3,B00AWRWBKS,"This exercise video was okay. It was challenging. The exercises are similar to insanity, but less intense. I don't think I will be purchasing another product",1395878400,,157,5.076923076923077
5524716,5,B00AWRWBKS,"This work out is great, however, I do not have a step and I am sure it would be nicer with it. When I purchase one in the future I will workout with it again.",1395014400,,158,3.5428571428571427
5524717,4,B00AWRWBKS,"Great workout using exercises that allow me to increase resistance (on my own with weights, depth of squats, height of jumps, etc.) as they become easier for me to do.  I dislike the extra time given twice for the 10-second cool down -- it goes against what I was taught about the Tabata method of exercise.  I love Cathe, but the quality of the manufacture of her DVD's is questionable.  I own five of them and four out of five have some type of freezing or skipping problem.  And, no, it's not my player -- it happens on every player I've ever tried them on.",1394150400,3,560,4.304761904761905

5524720,4,B00AWRWBKS,"The workouts illustrated are great.  However, I didn't give this a perfect rating because the music is not on a separate track or separate disc to allow me to use the music as I lead a class.",1389830400,,191,4.162162162162162
5524721,4,B00AWRWBKS,"Good workout.  I don't have a step tho and altho I do program w out it I think I'm missing a fair amt modifying.  They do tell u u need a step tho. I've been doing the 4 tabata one.  For me burns about 400 calories. I like it because the avg hr is high and max is what I would expect,  based on other hi intens cardios.  Time goes fast.",1389657600,3,336,3.676056338028169
5524722,4,B00AWRWBKS,"Great cardio workout.  My legs definitely feel the burn also.  Love that I can do just two segments if I just need a quick workout or I can do all segments if I want a longer workout.  I normally do HIIT workouts, but not tabata.  This is my first foray into tabata.  It's 20 seconds of intense work, 10 seconds of rest- repeat the entire segment.  Great workout but I still prefer HIIT where my heart recovers more between segments.  That doesn't mean though that this workout isn't on my regular workout rotation list!  Not as intense as something like Insanity, but less harsh on the knees and will definitely get your heart rate up- more so if you add in weighted gloves or ankle weights.",1388188800,7,692,4.436507936507937
8558556,5,B00AWRWBKS,great workout,1493337600,,13,6.0
8558557,5,B00AWRWBKS,"I am a long time Cathlete, but just tried this workout for the first time today. I did the pre-mix with all 5 tabatas and core workout #1 (approximately 55 minutes). Wow, it is a killer!! While I didn't keep up with Cathe and her crew during every single tabata set, I was still sucking wind and got a fantastic workout! It follows the traditional tabata format of 20 seconds of intense work followed by 10 seconds of recovery. In between each of the 5 tabatas (which are done 2x each) she kicks it up a notch from regular tabata and inserts ""recovery blasts"" using a step with 2 risers on each side. Whoa, mama!!

While a lot of the moves are high impact, it could easily be modified for those that either can't or don't want to do a lot of jumping. Also, you really don't need a step for the recovery blasts - you can follow along with the moves and do them standing on the floor. I did this a couple of times when I was extra winded. :-)

While this is a tough, tough cardio workout, it is also very do-able, in my opinion. This is due to the fact that each tabata move is only 20 seconds long and there is a timer on the screen, so you know exactly how long you have to suffer (haha) through the rest of the set. Also, the many pre-mixes allow you to choose how many tabatas you will do with each workout. You can work your way up, even starting out with just 1 tabata! For me, all of these things cut back on the dread factor that I often get from other HIIT workouts, where the intense sets seem to go on forever and I don't know how much time is left. 20 seconds is NOT that long, although it can certainly feel like it! Just when you think you need to stop, you are motivated to power through by seeing only a few seconds left on the timer. Also, this workout seemed to really fly by!

As always, Cathe is at the top of the fitness game and has delivered another amazing workout.  If you have never exercised to one of her DVDs, trust me, you are missing out!",1482710400,,1967,4.114583333333333
8558558,3,B00AWRWBKS,Requires a step and 2 risers.  My fault for not reading the description closer I guess. I will do it without the steps.  True Tabata has been the miracle shaper for me at age 40. Looking forward to revising my review once I have done the workout.,1476230400,2,246,4.212765957446808
