8751113,4,B01BQ7HRO2,"Not sure I'm willing to buy a universal DVD player just to see this series again!  That's what I get for not checking the specifications carefully.  The seller tried to help, but really there's nothing to do.",1535673600,,208,4.594594594594595
8751114,5,B01BQ7HRO2,"Houdini & Doyle is a winner. The mysteries are the type that Conan Doyle would have loved - a bit of horror, a bit of paranormal (for instance, Doyle's Hound of the Baskervilles or Sussex Vampire). Having two men who had such contradictory philosophies - Doyle fascinated by the paranormal/Houdini spending his whole life debunking mediums and seances - was a brilliant idea. Half the fun is their arguing whether the mystery is caused by spirits or real life murderers - usually reality wins out but with a touch of doubt that the paranormal might have been really behind it all. The female constable and women's rights are constantly coming up, but that was typical of the era in which these men would have lived - and totally relevant to our era as well. The actor who plays Doyle is very believable and his history with this father very accurate from all I have read about the creator of Sherlock Holmes. Houdini seems accurate as well - down to his daring a bully to hit him in the stomach - that was to be a factor in his death, although there's some dispute about why he actually died. But someone did punch him in the stomach when he wasn't ready here in my city of Detroit which lead to his death. I can only hope that people will pick up on this series and there will be more, since I would love to see more seasons.",1529798400,,1326,4.394308943089431

Loved the show and concept. Miss it.",1492214400,2,82,3.823529411764706
8751120,5,B01BQ7HRO2,When I watched a few of the episodes on TV I didn't quite get into it. But then I did a marathon of the series and now wish they'd make a second season. I think at first keep seeing Dirk Gently and Oscar from Elementary. Then they clicked. Season two please. Anyone listening?,1489449600,3,276,4.226415094339623
