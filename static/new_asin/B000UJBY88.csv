If it weren't for a small snippet about pumpkin ""procreation"" (wrapping the flowers in pantyhose to prevent fertilization), I would show this to my class because we are studying giant pumpkins.  I watched it on TV last week and had to own it.  My mom watched it with me last night and she just loved it too.  It is funny, tender and genuine Americana.  You will love it, too!",1193529600,6,399,4.337837837837838
2922062,5,B000UJBY88,"My husband and I watched this on PBS last night, and loved it.  It is very tongue and cheek in its presentation, while at the same time capturing a niche of the world I knew nothing about.  Who knew raising these behemoth pumpkins involved so much labor (and obsession)?  We were laughing constantly, and were very much drawn in by the stories of the individuals.  Definitely recommended!",1189036800,5,388,4.746268656716418

8213425,4,B000UJBY88,"I got this for my husband because he grows giant pumpkins. There wasn't any new information given out in it, so if your familiar with the process of growing these massive fruits then you won't be learning anything new. However it is entertaining to see the different steps people take to ensure there's is the biggest pumpkin.",1465689600,,326,4.7368421052631575
8213426,4,B000UJBY88,"Tales of folks that aspire to grow giant pumpkins with seeds from other large pumpkins. They must battle the weather, critters, insects, and even sabotage. Insightful and entertaining. Some attempts at humor. There is also a book about this.",1447804800,,241,5.205128205128205

8213428,5,B000UJBY88,"I already had this DVD, but I must have loaned it to someone and never got it back.  I bought another one, as even in this day and age of downloading, I consider it essential to own a real copy of this DVD.  It is one of the best pieces of tongue in cheek humour, combined with sympathetic observation of human quirkiness I have ever seen.  The only thing that would make it better is if it came packaged with some giant pumpkin seeds  ;-p",1433548800,2,439,4.129411764705883

8213432,5,B000UJBY88,"Lords of the Gourd, by Mark Lewis, who also made Rat, The Wonderful World of Dogs, The Natural History of the Chicken, and Cane Toads, among other comedic documentaries, is one of his best. It treats the subject of growing huge gourds in the same pseudo scientific light as the other subjects, slipping in quite a few really interesting pieces of information about gourds and gardening, while presenting it all in the droll but gripping atmosphere that has made him famous. Several individual growers are featured, all of whom have delightful if problematic relationships with their personal gourds. The climax of the film is the weight competition, where you begin to hold your breathe along with the rest of the local audience watching the drama. But you don't know who to root for, since all of the competitors are equally appealing and in love with their gourds. An all round fun film for the whole family.",1307145600,2,910,4.839743589743589
8213433,5,B000UJBY88,"This video does a top notch job at capturing the trials, tribulations and elation that can be part of raising a giant pumpkin and entering it into a competition. Very funny at times--the producer did an excellent job in relaying the dreams and nightmares of these pumpkin growers as the season progressed.

There is some how-to information, but this is mostly individual growers preferences. It is nice to see the contrast in techniques because it highlights that there are many ways to approach raising a prized fruit.

I'm going to try my hand at a Dill's Atlantic Giant pumpkin this year, so I'll be re-watching this video through the season for inspiration and an idea here and there.",1239408000,7,688,4.822033898305085
