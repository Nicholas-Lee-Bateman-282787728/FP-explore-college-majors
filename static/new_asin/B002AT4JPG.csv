8360265,3,B002AT4JPG,"Received this in great condition. As far as the dvd is concerned, it was good but it wasn't great. Only a few of the comedians (Roz, Rudy Rush, Lavell Crawford, Gary Owen, Redd Grant, Deon Cole-just to name a few) had hilarious routines that kept the audience and myself included rolling. Most of the other comedians were just average like it was their first time on stage and that threw me off. One of the acts actually got booed off the stage! The host, Doug Williams, seemed like he got more spotlight time than the comedians did. In my opinion, he wasn't all that funny; it was hit or miss with his material. Also, there is a some false advertising on the dvd. The back side states that there are 40 comedians but in actuality, there are only 36 (host not included) because some of the same comedians have ""comedy bits"" on the second dvd, and not another full routine. Plus there are no extra's or behind the scenes footage on either dvd.",1442966400,,942,4.4508670520231215
