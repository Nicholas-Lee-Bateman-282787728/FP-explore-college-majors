6983928,5,B00SHEOUMA,"This is truly a great set of episodes.  What we see here is the final of Thriller Bark and Brook's backstory.  The voice actors did a fantastic job and I would even say that this is some of their best work yet.  Best part about this set though would have to be that they were able to dub binks sake, or binks brew in the English dub, and it sounds amazing.  You also get two episode commentaries and and new feature called in the galley.  The two commentaries are great and pretty hilarious, and the in the galley feature is a sorta of Q&A video with some of the straw hat VA, and it is pretty entertaining to watch.  Overall all of the episodes are great to watch and brings an end to a really good story arc.  saboady starts next, and I cannot wait for that.",1428451200,2,760,4.129251700680272

6983933,4,B00SHEOUMA,"Covering episodes 373 up to 384 this set will take you through the end of the Thriller Bark Arc and all the way up to the episode before the beginning of the Sabody Archipelago Arc.  The Strawhats are battered and beaten up in their fight against the giant Oars and the Warlord Gekko Moria, and their attempts to rescue their shadows is further hindered by the true strength of Moria's devil fruit powers.  But their victory is short-lived when Bartholomew Kuma first encounters the Strawhats and displays his mysterious and dangerous new devil fruit abilities.  The Strawhats begin to realize that the endurance and strength they had displayed against their enemies up until now may no longer be enough to face the strongest enemies the ocean has to offer.  This arc also manages to properly introduce you to the humming swordsman Brook as his backstory is flushed out and we are shown just what a torturous existence a life in the fog of the Florian Triangle has been.

I am only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because while this set contains some awesome moments (including one of Zoro's greatest moments as a Strawhat and a character) the last three episodes are filler episodes.  While One Piece filler can be entertaining and usually serves as a fun way to tell an enjoyable story as well as pad out the anime so the manga can get ahead, these fillers are a little subpar.  Plus it is helped by the fact that Funimation is a little slow on the dub releases and so every filler episodes only adds to the lack of canon content (This fact is not factored into my review, but rather just a gripe I have with One Piece as an anime).

All in all the Thriller Bark Arc wraps up with a bang and the anime is about to enter some of the greatest arcs in its considerable runtime as the Strawhats are about to be faced with a series of events that will change their lives forever.",1426118400,3,1875,4.478005865102639
6983934,4,B00SHEOUMA,"Funimation doing a great job getting these voyages out after the awesome One Piece Z Movie.  Keep bringing these voyages out and I'll keep buying them.  Can't wait for season 7 and the Supernovas!! I also heard FUNI is considering dubbing the current episodes from Japan with a month delay on the One Piece Podcast.  I think that'd be an awesome idea as long as the current voyages keep coming out in the same pace you're going now.  I'd watch the current episodes and buy the voyages as they're released.  Go for it Funimation!
I recommend this voyage based on the previous 3 in season 6.",1425340800,7,589,4.518867924528302

6983964,4,B00SHEOUMA,"One of the most joyful moments in the entire One Piece series is contained in this volume.  After all of the enemies are defeated and Brook's somewhat tragic story is told, Brook leads the Straw Hat Pirates and Lola's pirate crew in singing ""Bink's Booze.""  And what could be more joyful than a room full of pirates drinking grog and singing YO HO HO?  You'll be rewinding this part and singing along, I guarantee it.

OK, just a couple spoilers.  Captain Lola mentions the Pirate Empress Boa Hancock for the first time (we don't actually get to see Hancock for a few more Voyages yet, but she is worth the wait).  Lola also mentions her mother who is a great pirate captain in the New World (there are some theories that Lola's mother is the Yonkou Big Mom, but I kind of hope not since Luffy and Big Mom are enemies presently).

This may be the last One Piece DVD for while.  It took about a year and a half to get from Season 3 to Season 4 and the better part of a year to get from Season 5 to Season 6 so I'm expecting a similar delay in getting to a whole new story arc in Season 7.  Season 7 should cover the Shabondy arc (the last time we see very much of the Straw Hat crew besides Luffy for about 80 episodes), the Amazon Lily arc (where we meet Boa Hancock), and the Impel Down arc.  These episodes had perhaps my favorite opening theme of the entire series, ""One World.""",1428624000,2,1381,4.216730038022813
