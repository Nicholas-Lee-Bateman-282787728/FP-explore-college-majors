5237494,5,B00915G6OE,"Much to the relief of its fans, ""CSI: NY"" dodged cancellation at the end of the 2011-2012 TV season. It was renewed for a ninth season of 17 episodes, with all principal cast members returning.  The show continues to feature compelling crime of the week mysteries, to be solved by a closely knit ensemble cast working with the latest CSI techniques in New York, the City that Never Sleeps.

As always, the show shines a spotlight on individual season regulars from week to week.  Among the highlights: Senior Detective Mac Taylor (Gary Sinese) returns to the CSI lab after surviving a nearly fatal gunshot wound at the end of season eight.  Mac is crustier than ever, and struggling with the after-effects of his wound, which include troublesome short term memory loss.  The affliction affects his relationships within the lab, especially with close friend Jo Danville (Sela Ward).  Mac and Jo will have to work it out on a case that takes them to San Francisco.  Mac's relationship with girlfriend Christine Whitney will evolve in unexpected ways, and will be the subject of a cross-over episode with CSI in Las Vegas.

Detective Lindsey Monroe (Anna Belknap) works to balance marriage (to Detecter Danny Messer) and motherhood with her job.  In one extended story arc, her youth in Montana will reach out to touch her present life in New York, when she is called back to testify in an old and very personal murder case.  Detective Don Flack (Eddie Cahill) will work through some longstanding family issues early in the season. He will spend much of the season working with a new partner, an attractive former undercover cop named Lovato, who presents a number of professional and personal challenges.  Lab rat Adam (A.J. Buckley) will get a love interest and a startling episode featuring his father.

Several episodes will feature clever constructs. One of them will pit Mac and his lab against a killer playing a life-sized and lethal game of ""Clue.""  Another case, involving a woman found dead in a pond, requires the crew to find a missing witness based on the thinnest of evidence.  Still another case will feature Lindsey's not so secret search for a prankster in the lab.  The season finale features an especially tough and emotional case that causes Mac Taylor to question the trajectory of his life.

""CSI: NY"" continues to be a good police procedural that invests in its characters, and is highly recommended to its fans in its ninth season on CBS.",1354320000,53,2460,4.849282296650718
5237495,5,B00915G6OE,"Very good quality, and a bonus of no commercials. Excellent episode! Highly recommended to anymore who enjoys the show. Best season so far!!!!!",1353888000,,143,5.260869565217392

5237497,5,B00915G6OE,I am very pleased with my purchase. This season of CSI NY is another great season. I have to say this is one of my favorite shows.,1353369600,,130,3.8518518518518516
5237498,5,B00915G6OE,"I still love watching the CSI's in New York lead by one of the best actors out there, Gary Sinise.  Keep up the good work!",1353369600,,122,3.88
5237499,4,B00915G6OE,"Because cbs unwisely put this on 8 pm slot on friday night,  I have to buy the show so I can dvr ""fringe' and 'grimm' which are also at this time.  WHy they don't put this on an hour before the other two shows is beyond me. This one has the crew traveling to san francisco to locate a missing girl. It's typical csi ny with the cast doing a fine job and there's the twist of gary sinese's character Mac struggling with his brain injury. I can relate to that one.  The hd looked pretty good on the instant order. sadly this show has been cancelled now. But it had a very good run to be sure.",1351296000,,590,3.983050847457627
5237500,5,B00915G6OE,"This episode begins season 9 of CSI NY.  This episode is a bit unusual for CSI NY as the initial suspect, serial arsonist Leonard Brooks, ends up helping Mac and the team to some extent in solving the crime, which is an interesting twist.  The 6 month period of Mac's recovery from the injuries he received during the season 8 season finale get explored some in flashbacks.  This episode is important to watch as the story line of Mac Taylor's health is clearly something that will be continuing for a number of episodes.  It is also important to watch this episode prior to watching episode 2 of this season as that episode continues the Leonard Brooks story line.",1349827200,,665,4.610169491525424
5237501,4,B00915G6OE,"This episode of CSI NY continues a story line started in Season 9 Episode 1 involving a serial arsonist, Leonard Brooks, and concludes that story line.  In order to understand it and who the serial arsonist is, be sure to watch Season 9 Episode 1 first.  This episode involves much more psychology than many CSI NY episodes, as they try to understand the motivations of the arsonist.  Do be forwarned that the deaths in this episode are much more twisted than your typical CSI NY episode and involve fire.  The corpses are shown in some detail, and as a result of the methods of death, are shown more graphically than is normal for the majority of episodes.",1349827200,,657,4.589743589743589

5237538,5,B00915G6OE,"The final season is pretty good.  By the ninth season the whole production crew and cast knew just what they were doing and what worked.  Every show was good.  We like this series because the mysteries are always interesting, and we like the characters.  The final two shows in season nine - the last two in the entire series - are, frankly, rather smaltzy, feel-good romance stories about the cast, tying up their personal storylines in a ""and they lived happily ever after"" way, but we liked them. And why not? Not ever series needs to end like The Shield or Breaking Bad.",1485475200,,574,4.543689320388349

5237651,2,B00915G6OE,"A tired and somewhat disappointing final season. The main actors are all back again and they all seem burned out. Even the Flack/Lovato romance seemed contrived and hurried, and Sid's cancer sub-plot never saw much development (guessing he was planning to leave the series had it been renewed?)  Gary Sinese is excellent as usual, and happy to see one decent way in which they wrapped up the series (spoiler alert) with his proposal to Christine, which made for a nice series bookend considering the first episode of the series touched on Mack lamenting the loss of his wife on 9-11.  I thought the series started a lot better and gradually got more sappier as it progressed. There were a couple decent episodes this series (such as the ""Northern Exposure"" pyro guy) but otherwise nothing much here. Good they brought the series to an end when they did.",1462752000,,853,4.795918367346939
