5324047,5,B009FB3ZAW,"This movie has many twist and turns and great character development.  I really enjoyed this film, for the entertainment value and a completely different take on all the other Bigfoot movies out there I give it 5 stars.",1358899200,2,218,4.7368421052631575
5324048,1,B009FB3ZAW,"The ""film"" was horrible.  Not only did it portray the residents of Siskiyou County as a bunch of pot growing yokels, it was poorly made.  I guess when you buy a low-budget film, you get what you paid for !",1357948800,,205,4.1
5324049,1,B009FB3ZAW,Wether you like like bigfoot or manlove this movie will give you both...if your really into rednecks raping dudes this movie is for you..with a couple of quick shots of big foot...worst movie ever,1357257600,8,196,4.794117647058823
5324050,1,B009FB3ZAW,This movie stinks worse than the real bigfoot! Dont wast your time. or your money. they should have named it something else cause you never see bigfoot!,1356739200,2,152,4.666666666666667

5324052,1,B009FB3ZAW,"This was terrible - we've reached the zenith of the found footage movie - this is one of the all time worst. Absolutely awful. Bad acting, everything terrible. A complete waste of time.

And what's worse is of course, the director Richard Halpern has written a review here, the first one (5 stars! Saw this at a packed screening blah blah blah). I assure you there was no packed screening for this amateurfest. The same guy also reviewed one other movie called ""Burned"" and guess who the director was? I've said it before, I'll say it again - people who worked on the cheapo amateurfests should not be allowed to also ""review"" them and pretend to be someone who watched it. It's dishonest and unethical.",1355184000,10,703,4.624
5324053,5,B009FB3ZAW,"I saw this movie at a packed theatrical screening in Los Angeles and I was floored! It's truly chilling with many twists and turns, with one really great plot twist that blew my mind!  I love it, the audience loved it, you must see this movie asap!",1354838400,5,248,4.276595744680851
5324054,1,B009FB3ZAW,Worst movie I ever seen.,1437004800,,24,4.0
5324055,1,B009FB3ZAW,"I started out with low expectations for a found footage BF movie. I just wanted a B movie romp where the unseen creature scares people in the woods.  I didn't bother reading reviews, that was my mistake.  Over the years, insomnia and boredom have driven to watch some terrible movies, but this was honestly one of the worst.  Do not waste your time with this stinker!",1427068800,,367,4.53030303030303
5324056,1,B009FB3ZAW,"The older brother is an annoying big mouth and the movie isn't about Bigfoot-tho you will see him. I like found footage movies, but that brother (I forgot his name) ruined it.",1426723200,,175,4.5
5324057,1,B009FB3ZAW,"The trailer voiceover is definitely the highlight of this microbudget, weekend shoot, c-horror video. The two male leads turned in a tolerable performance (the old man was laughably over the top), but the script, plot, and directing were all terrible. The DVD cover does a pretty good job of showing you what you're in for: cheesy, boring, run-of-the-mill Bigfoot found footage (I think there are five or six of these currently available on Amazon, two of which are definitely worth catching and ones I'd recommend (""Exists"" being the best, followed by ""Willow Creek"") ... Definitely take a pass on this one.",1423872000,2,608,5.02970297029703
5324058,1,B009FB3ZAW,"If getting sodomized by hillbillies is your idea of a bigfoot movie, then this is for you.",1422144000,3,90,4.352941176470588
5324059,1,B009FB3ZAW,"Anyone watching this expecting a Bigfoot movie will be sorely disappointed. Anyone who thought Deliverance was great might like this one, though, as all it's missing is the banjo playing. The creators of this movie had no respect for fans of Sasquatch, he gets one shot at the end, at distance, no less. As for the rest, well the plot, even the lines are ripped off, sometimes word for word, from the Blair Witch Project. I mean, there isn't even a hint at anything even remotely original in it. The villains are homosexual rednecks and both the heroes (if you want to call them that) end up raped and dumped someplace. And that is the end of the movie...wow!  Who was this piece of crap made for anyway..? NAMBLA?  Kids are interested in Bigfoot, you don't want them seeing a POS of like this. And the last tiny shot of the Sasquatch looking out from the woods, very insulting. There are a lot of bad Bigfoot movies out there, this would be the worst of them, save that he is only in it for, like, a second (the rest of it devoted to homosexual hillbillies), so it doesn't really qualify as a Bigfoot movie. I'd want my money back, save I rented it from the library, still, it was a big waste of time. The fact that someone even invested in this thing being made is the only mystery involved here.",1421539200,2,1298,4.381742738589212
5324060,1,B009FB3ZAW,"I've seen most of these bigfoot flicks and I think that there's something that's a bit creepy about any movie that involves being in the wilderness after sundown. Do yourself a favor. Go out on the porch with nothing but a flashlight for light instead of wasting two or three bucks renting this terrible movie. To be fair about it, the acting wasn't that bad, in just about every other aspect, this movie fell flat on it's face, even for a bigfoot movie.",1421452800,,454,4.481927710843373

5324062,3,B009FB3ZAW,Lots of shaky cam menace just most of it from hostile rednecks and interpersonal conflict. This could've been a movie or something more and it teetered on the edge but didn't quite make it.  Three twentysomethings go looking for Bigfoot and find all manner of menace and violence in the woods just not from the source you would expect. The discovery in the last few seconds of the film was almost a cheap shot to Blair witch rather than an homage.,1417910400,,447,4.518518518518518
5324063,1,B009FB3ZAW,The worst of all i've seen thus far. Nothing to do with bigfoot. Some morons going into the woods and getting messed up by the local pot growers.,1414972800,3,145,4.214285714285714

5324066,1,B009FB3ZAW,"I do not normally write reviews.  However, this was such a misleading title and description I felt people should be warned.  It is NOT about BIGFOOT; it is about backwoods halfhuman/dogs.  This was insulting.  Not worth a cent and a waste of my time.",1409616000,2,250,4.613636363636363
5324067,3,B009FB3ZAW,"A generic look at the Bigfoot phenomenon, with cookie cutter characters and benign dialogue.",1405641600,,92,5.642857142857143
5324068,1,B009FB3ZAW,Not sure about this one I don't remember it at all so it couldn't of been too good.  I'm doubting it was much good.,1402272000,,115,3.7916666666666665
5324069,2,B009FB3ZAW,"I love the idea that their 'may' be a Bigfoot creature hiding in the woods, and their are very few movies that highlight this belief. This movie was fantastic, edge of the seat , and despite no name actors, was really well done , UNTIL THE END!! The way this movie ended was s***. Sorry to curse, but wow, they ruined it. It was confusing and disappointing and has the potential to be rewritten, reshoot the ending sequence and rereleased with HUGE success. At least they could have offered an alternate ending.  And, IF THE PRODUCERS, WRITERS OR DIRECTOR IS READING THIS,  I HAVE AM IDEA FOR AN ENDING THAT WOULS MAKE THISOVIE AMAZING...just saying.",1394323200,,650,4.643478260869565
5324070,1,B009FB3ZAW,"Haha okay, you got me.  I fell for it, I rented this thinking it was actually going to be a BIGFOOT movie.

I rate this: 250 ""F"" bombs that were dropped during the film.  Absolute torture to watch.  The most pointless film EVER.  I literally turned the volume off so I could get through watching it.  I should have just turned it off.",1388707200,3,334,4.222222222222222
5324071,3,B009FB3ZAW,Movie was a lot better than the reviews I read. It's keeps you guessing and it was really filmed in bigfoot country in Northern California.,1388016000,2,139,4.6

5324073,1,B009FB3ZAW,"This movie has nothing to do with bigfoot - this is about hicks who kidnap, homosexual rape, and murder.

5324074,1,B009FB3ZAW,"One of the worst movies ever.  Story was ridiculous; had nothing to do with Bigfoot.  Language was atrocious. If the ""f"" word was said one time, it was said 1,000. Total waste of time and money.",1373587200,2,194,4.361111111111111
5324075,1,B009FB3ZAW,"Think Blair Witch meets Deliverance.  We bought this because it said it was about Bigfoot country and we thought it would be something creepy but fun.  Unfortunately, it abruptly went to rape and violence without any warning and was absolutely horrible.  I'm with the guy that thinks whoever made this movie owes EVERYONE a refund.
What a total fraud.
We threw it in the garbage.",1370995200,6,379,4.8

What did I learn about wilderness survival from ""Bigfoot County?""
1. You must always antagonize your creepy guide, and accuse him of being lost even when it is obvious you are not.
2. When your guide begins to leave, you MUST stay right where you are. You'll be fine out in the mountains all on your own!
3. When threatened at gunpoint by crazy hillbillies, who give you five minutes to ""leave my land"" or suffer severe consequences, agree with one another to comply and then quickly decide to ignore the threat (at gunpoint) and stay the night right where you are. After all, what's the worst that a shotgun-wielding crazed hillbilly who almost just raped your girlfriend can do? Just be sure to put all of your survival necessities in a bag, so they will be safely left behind if you have to leave quickly.
4. When being stalked by crazed hillbillies, be sure to stop and yell as loud as you can every few yards; would not want them to be able to find you and kill you, now would we?
5. Hillbillies in NW California are magical. They can cast a spell that suddenly yanks away your companions through thick forest, with no explanation. The proper way to respond is not to immediately pursue your companion, but instead to stand still yelling their name over and over, to yell to them you plan on coming to rescue them, and THEN to begin to move. Some cynical persons would suggest this delay obviously gives the film crew time to hide, but in reality this counters the magical hillbilly spell.
6. Never arm yourself when fighting for your life. Even when the hillbillies leave a highly effective weapon for you, be sure to throw it into the woods.
7. Always leave a light on at night. Some would wonder why you would want all the hillbillies to know where you are sleeping, but the light actually keeps the magical hillbillies away.
8. If you are caught, you will be raped. If you are male.

I could go on and on, but will stop here. Please do yourself a favor, and skip Blaire Bigfoot County.",1369785600,7,2016,4.475543478260869
5324078,1,B009FB3ZAW,"The worst Bigfoot Movie I ever seen in My Life.please Read ALL the 1 star reviews About this trash Before Buying it,I was lucky I Didnt Pay anymore than $6.00 for it from the Video Store. Wasnt even any sightings in this Movie hardly @ all. Then there was some homosexual activity I Dont Know what to do with this Movie. I don't want to stain My collection of Bigfoot Movies by adding This movie To My collection Bigfoot movies. Alls It is,is a queer movie disguised as a Bigfoot Movie.

5324080,3,B009FB3ZAW,"Had some cool moments but it rips off ""Blair Witch Project"" in a ruthless way.
Not as bad as a lot of others say. It's worth a look at but don't expect too much.
Has some creepy people in it that adds a little but should have concentrated more on the creepy people.  The scene at night where the pack of Bigfoots are chasing them is pulled off well.
Interesting twist at the end to kind of create a Nightmare scenario.

Last shot is kind of disturbing too.  It plays off like a dark nightmare.",1362096000,2,493,4.168421052631579

This was seriously the worst movie I have ever spent money on! Terrible actors AND characters! I couldn't wait for them to die and never darken my sight again!! It had absolutely nothing to do with Bigfoot either.
