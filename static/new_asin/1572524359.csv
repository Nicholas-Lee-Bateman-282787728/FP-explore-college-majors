189059,1,1572524359,"George is a young and irresponsible bus driver from Glasgow, Scotland. He ends up getting fired for, among other offenses, giving free rides to a Nicaraguan immigrant named Carla. George then becomes romantically obsessed with Carla and buys two plane ticket so they can go to Nicaragua and search for her ex-boyfriend Antonio. What the hell is this guy thinking? But wait it gets even weirder.

From there George follows her like a puppydog through various Nicaraguan warzones full of good guy Sandinistas and bad guy Contras before Carla finally discovers her lost love Antonio. Then George happily makes his way home to Scotland.

This most unlikely ""love story"" is also a Communist propaganda film. Yes, Somoza was a horrible dictator and Reagan, Oliver North and crew were certainly wrong to covertly and illegally fund the Contras, (remember the Iran-Contra scandal). But the Sandinistas were no saints themselves. They formed a totalitarian Marxist-Leninist government which censored the free expression of dissent and received military support from the Soviet Union.

Because of Reagan's funding of the Contras, American liberals, like myself, tended to romanticize the Sandinistas in the 1980's. But the truth is that they were just another corrupt, authoritarian Latin American regime, like Castro in Cuba or Chavez in Venezuela. Because of Cold War politics, the war in Nicaragua raged on for more than a decade and victimized the ordinary people of the country, who were murdered and brutalized by both Contras and Sandinistas. But this movie declines to present a balanced portrait.

By the way, I am still a liberal. But the maturity and education that have come to me with age, along with being married to a wonderful Latina, have helped me develop a more knowledgable and realistic perspective on Latin American politics.

It's hard to say which part of the film is worse - the totally ridiculous ""romance"" between George and Carla or the Sandinista propaganda. Also the thick Scottish accents in the early part of the movie are nearly incomprehensible and the second half of the movie is mostly in Spanish. Yet the film has no subtitles. Stay away from this one.",1187049600,7,2179,5.109550561797753
189060,5,1572524359,"As always, Ken Loach made of a simple story, a revealing, breathtaking and hard to forget movie around a Scottish bus driver and a Nicaraguan woman.

Inch by inch, a worthy film to watch.",1160438400,5,187,4.5
189061,3,1572524359,"The first Loach flick that left me somewhat unmoved. A Glaswegian buser falls for a beautiful yet shell-shocked Nicaraguan refugee. She had witnessed some of the contras' attrocities (they were trained and armed by the US military). Under his large socialist umbrella, Loach stays outside of the perimeter on this one. No particular depth of the story, little warmth save the obvious sympathy. He's done much better in his starker, more uncompromising and less ""romantic"" flicks such as ""My Name Is Joe"" or any of his early Brit working class masterworks. Still, even the sentimentally toned down Carla's Song, mostly due to the terrific Robert Carlisle (spelling?)-is highly watchable flick.",1140652800,2,692,5.3
189062,5,1572524359,"In this film, Director Ken loach sucessfully crystalized his unshaken belief on humanity.
 there's clear difference between his former film ""land and freedom"", both films descrive one indivisual goes through wartime in foreign country and the end of personal relationship they confront in the middle of chaotic situation. However, unlike ""Land and freedom"", the hero,Jorge,bus driver in Glassgow,never has been politically motivated character in the first place. He went to nicaragua together with his girlfriend, Carla, to help her to face her past by finding her ex-boyfriend and to overcome inner trauma and scar. Jorge eventully started being frustrated with his powerlessness against the inhuman crisis ongoing in her homeland.
 Contrally to ""land and freedom"" The story moves on from personal reality to political reality. Yet more importantly, this film beautifully captures one's spiritual growth through relationship.
 I think that's what makes this film so real, powefull and thought provoking one.",1062201600,15,1008,5.662251655629139
189063,4,1572524359,"in carlla's song, ken loach explores love in the midst of hell when a reckless and irresponsible bus driver (robert carlyle) falls in love with a beautiful but suicidal nicaraguan refugee(oyanka cabezas). she is suffering  from severe case of survivor's guilt and as the driver falls deeper and  deeper in love with her, it becomes obvious that he is going to have to  quelle her nigtmares  and that means taking her back to a nicaraguan war  zone to confront her demons. Ken loach's matter of fact ease with  situational dialogue translates well into all of the necessary languages,  and the result is a very special movie.",951436800,25,624,4.830188679245283
189064,5,1572524359,"Possibly Ken Loach's finest work. If you only know Robert Carlyle from The Full Monty, then view this. Thee won't be a dry eye in the house. The DVD transfer is disappointing & the extras are minimal to say the least but  the quality of the story & film making outshine any technical  misgivingd",928368000,27,295,4.444444444444445
7797574,4,1572524359,"Its a very nice story about a Scottish man falling for a fornign girl. This was done with no script and there are great moments of acting. Some people might need subtitles to watch it because some talking is in Spanish. This girl definitely, is going through a certain mental illness,but George just wants her to be happy. Theres a bit of chaos that goes on after both of them get to Nicaragua. Very nice ending.",1522713600,,412,4.434210526315789
7797575,5,1572524359,"Robert Carlyle portrays how a young Scottish bus driver's  sense of decency takes him deep into the heart of a warring country in South America.  He knows the young immigrant dancer, poignantly performing in  a ruffled costume over her jeans has a deeper story,  And he accompanies her to SouthAmerica to find her home and her life,  The warring faction has made it a place of pain for those who rebel and yet in their spare moments they still have time to celebrate life.  He has  to decide whether to rescue her from the gunfire, cruelty and blood or to reevaluate if he could live her way with her.",1493251200,,601,4.458715596330276
7797576,5,1572524359,Awesome movie,1423958400,,13,6.0
7797577,4,1572524359,Would have been 5 stars had it been easier to understand. The actress playing Carla had a vary soft voice. There was too much Spanish dialogue without subtitles. The acting by all was very good. I'm glad I bought it.,1413763200,,216,4.425
7797578,5,1572524359,I like this version better because it has the song and dance elements in it that gives the audience a little relief from the harshness of the situation in Nicaragua and Carla's nightmares. Both versions are beautiful.,1372291200,,217,4.891891891891892
7797579,1,1572524359,You can't understand 98% of the dialogue. No wonder Robert Carlyle didn't come to Hollywood to do movies. He can't enunciate! He peaked with Full Monty! It's a ridiculous plot! I bought it because I do like Carlyle on Once Upon A Time but not this.  This movie is stupid and a waste of time and money.,1354320000,,301,4.280701754385965
7797580,3,1572524359,"I'm fortunate because I grew up in McAllen, TX and I therefore have a solid, working understanding of Spanish. I, therefore, didn't realize how much it was being spoken without subtitles until my husband asked me what the characters were talking about.

Although the sudden obsession Robert Carlyle's character has for Carla is rushed and the fact that he's actually engaged (to his best friend?) while all this takes place is almost completely bipassed, it's still a nice drama.

I admit I expected more when he follows her to Nicaragua. More explanation, more political problems, more ...just MORE. I can understand an instantaneous infatuation/obsession, it does happen, but it seems rushed in order to 1. ceate the relationship and 2. get them the heck out of Scotland and off to Nicaragua where the action is supposed to take place, yet it doesn't.

All this, plus he's with her to help her search for her long lost boyfriend???

And then there's the whole Spanish thing. It's no wonder that Robert Carlyle felt the need to learn some Spanish for this role. He'd have been completely lost without it. Fortunately for everyone involved, Carlyle does that thing were he can manage to be amazing in just about anything and makes it watchable. Makes it dramatic. Makes you involved even when, at times, you're completely lost.",1343260800,5,1327,4.937219730941704
7797581,5,1572524359,I received this in great conditon and enjoyed the story. I have watched it several times and enjoy it very much. Thank you for my order so quickly.,1338768000,,147,4.285714285714286
7797582,4,1572524359,This was a good movie the players did an excelant performance. The only problem was some of the dialog was in Spanish and I didn't follow along with Carla. Otherwise wonderful love story.,1267315200,,187,4.696969696969697
7797583,1,1572524359,"I thought it would be a nice love story, but it is hopelessly depressing and not a happy movie.  The worst thing about the movie is that somewhere in the middle; the director stop translating the spanish dialogue into english, and left us non-speaking spanish to figured out what was being said.  The best part was the ending.  No place like home.",1236211200,,347,4.564516129032258
