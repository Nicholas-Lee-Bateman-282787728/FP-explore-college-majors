After purchasing, I realized I already had two copies from my BOSU purchases. It's a good video if you bought a BOSU secondhand or repackaged, withouth the free DVD.",1237766400,13,282,4.4423076923076925
3049820,5,B0010SQ780,"I bought this VHS tape shortly after purchasing a BOSU.  It it hard to find much out there for the BOSU.  A lot of it is too advanced if you have balance issues, which I do after just having a cervical fusion. The video that comes with the Bosu is way too tough for a person that isn't FIT and highly aerobic.  This video is doable and that's what I like about it.  I didn't feel like a failure because I couldn't do it.  They had a normal version and a modified version which was quite helpful.",1213574400,5,495,4.061855670103093

8238414,5,B0010SQ780,"Update 1/11/16: I am still surprised at how challenging this video is.  I did it yesterday and struggled as it progressed, as I just transitioned from the very small Bosu sport to the larger and taller Bosu pro.  Different sized Bosus will really change the difficulty level as well as the comfort level.  The large blue Bosu makes all my Bosu workouts a lot harder than when I was using the small pink Sport model.  this is why I'm updating my review and star rating.  Anyway, I really experienced an incredible workout with this video and recommend it for people who want to keep Bosu workous as their main or as part of their workout routine. There aren't many Bosu videos out there.  This is a good one and, even better, I was able to do the whole thing barefoot.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This workout had me sweating.  I would describe this as a formative experience going from basic acclimation to some pretty darn challenging moves that I could barely do.  This is a 30 minute workout that is perfect for weeknights.  No frills.  Nothing fancy.  I did it barefoot on a Bosu Sport Trainer and it was not easy.  The ambiance reminded me of the 80's for some weird reason. :-)",1447113600,2,1195,4.6380952380952385

8238417,1,B0010SQ780,"Can only give this one star.  I ordered this dvd, and ended up getting a book for a core workout with a full balance ball.
For some reason they will not let me take the book back or exchange it-----another item that will join the others----under my bed.",1381968000,,253,4.270833333333333
8238418,5,B0010SQ780,I love this exercise DVD because anyone can work out to it. It is easily understood and makes working out on the Bosu ball satisfying. A great workout!,1334102400,3,151,4.428571428571429
8238419,5,B0010SQ780,"I got this DVD with my Bosu but I'm getting ready to buy it again because I lost it.  I have 3 other Bosu videos, a package deal that Bosu sells, but they were nothing in comparison with this first training video.  I love that the exercises are simple to follow so you can focus on technique and not foot work.  As simple as they seem every move is a challenge when you first start BOSU.  Every step is now a balancing act.  I felt results and improvements by the second week I was doing the video.  Balance is a great way to gauge strength gained.  I could feel myself get less wobbly, I graduated to the advanced poses little by little, and once I was strong and deep into the moves I added hand weights and started all over.  Now I do the leg work and presses, curls, and raises with the rhythm of the other moves.  I can just keep adding weights, this will never get old.  The video is quick and well laid out.  It's broken up into 3 segments so you can do what you have time for. I always feel like I've really exerted myself in my living room.  I miss this workout video.",1263600000,10,1077,4.100478468899522
