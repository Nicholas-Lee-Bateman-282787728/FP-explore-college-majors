Any of them would have failed director Hiroshi Ishikawa. If you ask me; however,  that rule should be violable and the key questions should be the ability of the film to maintain a cinematic standard and to speak to the viewer at some level.

Ishikawa hails from the world of TV advertising, which is odd as everything about Tokyo. Sora (Tokyo Sky) is the polar opposite of any commercial anyone has seen. The director must have had his fill of that world. In contrast, the film is minimalist, beyond downcast, short on mono or dialogue to the point of being a silent movie cross, shot with a plethora of stationary camera techniques and those are often incomplete with the actual action not shown and out of the view. There is a scene where one of the characters deliberately cuts herself, but it remains off-camera and the viewer is treated to the trickling and collecting blood instead. Yes, there are not any major developments, climaxes, explosions or revelations, but would that be a concern? Not in these quarters. The same could be said of another Japanese film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Japanese-Movie-Kamome-Shokudo-w-English-Subtitles/dp/B001OTPDE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Japanese Movie "" Kamome Shokudo"" w/ English Subtitles</a>, which was as enjoyable as it was subdued. What would be troublesome is the absence of a beginning or an ending - as much as that might be the point of the film. What also becomes apparent in Tokyo. Sora is the existential care for the ""little things in everyday life"" and not the big picture.

Tokyo. Sora is the day-to-day story of six girls in that city. One is a Chinese girl learning Japanese and posing as a model at art school. The second is a nerdy girl who aspires to be an actress. She makes money by passing out promotional tissues in the city. The third girl is going to school and wants to enhance her body and become more attractive. Girl number four has a steady job waitressing at a caf, but has as much business as she receives reciprocated affection from the bartender-cum-chef. Then there is the girl who wants to be a hairdresser and makes money as a hostess. She is followed by the girl who wants to be a novelist and (remember this is Tokyo) makes money as a hostess. There is an unofficial seventh character who is a cat. Each is lonely and awkward, slow and tedious and so much so that the city's ambient noise takes precedence and wins over their lives nearly every time.
Their stories are shown not in overlapping sequences but by mostly jumping from one to the other.

Tokyo. Sora is a story of communication and contact or, in this case, absence thereof and lost opportunities. The Chinese girl not being able to communicate with a man she crushes on is an obvious set-up, but the film throws one such situation after the other at us to the point that the two hostesses work at the same girl's bar and do not even know one another. What these girls are up to in Tokyo is the story, yet it is far from banal. Similar to real-life it is the pandemonium of the ordinary. It depicts empty lives unfulfilled. It shows girls who have not made it and probably never will. It shows that all contact under the sky is desultory and ultimately unfruitful. Why bother when happiness is not a consequence? Isolation is the norm in the city and there is hardly anyone or any prospect to communicate.
The film allows a glimmer of hope when one takes a chance and communicates, which leads to the film's rare moment of joy when, as an act of vengeance against everything described thus far, Haruka Igawa (who has a nice role in the other Tokyo So..., namely&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tokyo-Sonata/dp/B003B2C980/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tokyo Sonata</a>&nbsp;) and Yuka Itaya cast off their layers to joyfully run in Tokyo. However, before the audience is allowed to raise its hands in triumph and just like the discussion of the menu at the caf, the freedom one feels watching the girls run around with wind against their skins ends up in ultimate tragedy.

So here is a conclusion, a comment, learning and some advice. The film's slow crawl to nothingness is faintly made up for with the clever way the women brush against each other. It makes the viewer question who one has come across without knowing it. Machida Ko is a punk writer and somewhat cool in Japan. We also learn that women (and men) love to smoke beyond the average in Tokyo. Most importantly, however, is this: do not watch Tokyo. Sora if you currently suffer from solitude.",1404604800,,4729,4.921052631578948
