2179460,5,B00069DMC8,"In this series (parts 1-3) Batman doesn't just kick butt (Batman Begins).  He's also a detective and scientist.  In this cartoon, the character is a balance of intelligence and training.  Bruce Wayne can laugh, Batman can even tell an occasional joke, but the character gets more convicted and consistently driven as the show goes on.
Characters like Robin, Clayface, and Mr. Freeze, who were at one time quite silly in nature, are given an overhaul, and a terribly dark tragic side.
The show also tries to flesh out a series of characters, experiment with which ones will work and which ones won't and create some sweeping episodes.  ""The Demon's Quest"" feels like an Indiana Jones movie (or Lara Croft for you kids).  Some characters were misses (Lock-up, Invisible Man, Clock King, Sewer King), while some were so spot-on they've been included in the comic or film continuum (Harley Quinn, Lucius Fox).
Bits of trivia, homage to classic DC, and references to literature and history, flesh out some of the most creative stories (Tyger Tyger, Zatana, The Gray Ghost).
I strongly recommend all of these.  As well as about anything else where Bruce Timm and/or Paul Dini are working with the Batman character.",1225065600,,1208,4.955445544554456
2179461,4,B00069DMC8,"Quite honestly, I bought this set for myself. Seeing so many animated shows from the 80's and 90's make their DVD debut (thank you, WB!), it was like reliving my after-school & Saturday morning childhood all over again.

Seasons 1 and 2 of Batman: TAS is superb. While the animation isn't quite up to par with today's cartoons (or, honestly, even some of the better shows of its day), it is still terrificly done. Also, I'm finding the stories just as engaging and the action just as exciting as an adult as when I was younger.

The best part (aside from getting to watch my favorite cartoons w/o commercials) is the fact that my kids really like watching it, too. So many of today's toons are nothing but senseless violence, mysticism, or worse yet, completely brainless anime-inspired garbage. Batman: TAS episodes often come with a moral, a thought-provoking and meaningful problem with which our hero finds a solution using brains, THEN brawn, to rectify. Getting to experience these all over again, this time with my kids huddled up on the sofa with me, it's great. It's like reading a story at bedtime, without having to do the voices myself.",1162598400,,1148,4.763819095477387
2179462,5,B00069DMC8,"BATMAN the Animated Series. Boy did I wait a long time for it to finally grace the DVD. But it's out and it's great. Volume 1 & 2 both have some of the most amazing episode, in my opinion. Since it was the beginning of the series, they have to introduce the villains (giving the origin of the likes of Two-Face, Clayface, Clock King and most importantly - Mr. Freeze in the very well made episode Heart of Ice). Not only villains are introduced though, Robin's Reckoning tells you the origin of Boy Wonder. Beware Of The Gray Ghost hints at what was the inspiration for BATMAN himself.

Besides establishing characters, some episodes make a superb job of just making you laugh - most episodes with the Joker (obviously), with The Joker's Favor and Joker's Wild being the funniest in my opinion. Another hilarious episode is Almost Got 'Im (not solely with Joker) and it has a nice twist.

Heart Of Steel is pretty interesting too.

It's the other episodes that make BATMAN so appealing to me. Ones that have to do with the emotions.

Nothing To Fear brings back the tragedy of Bruce Wayne that continuously haunts him. Perchance To Dream does the opposite - it's Bruce Wayne's dreamworld, call it a ""what if"" episode. Night Of The Ninja & Day Of The Samurai both provide nice backstory about Bruce Wayne, his training and his resolve to be the best there is in martial arts.

Now I would be perfectly happy with just the episodes, but there are special features as well. They're not lame at all: several audio commentaries, and some featurettes (Voices Of The Knight actually shows the man behind the mask and, of course, Mark Hamill as the Joker). One special feature even is a Pilot Promo episode!

I watched BATMAN the Animated Series as a kid on TV I loved it then and I love it now. It IS something special, because this cartoon is far from being cartoony (unfortunately the New Batman Adventures were heading there, some episodes quite so). They just have this great mood, the producers of the series call them ""minimovies"", and that's what they truly are. Believe me, many are waaaaay better than actual movies (not only the Batman ones).

5 star rating, definitely.",1143417600,4,2173,4.643229166666667
2179463,5,B00069DMC8,La serie esta muy bien hecha... la calidad de la serie es la misma que la television.. el sonido es 2.0 .. una mejora hubiera sido 5.1 pero por lo menos viene con 2 tracks importantes la voz original en ingles..  y la mejor parte el track en espaol ya que leer subtitulos algunas veces es muy aburrido... en fin cosas para mejorar .. me parece que solo el sonido .. ya que la calidad del video para mi siempre es mejor si es la original,1130284800,,436,4.069767441860465
2179464,4,B00069DMC8,"My two boys are big Batman fans. This was a good deal for me. We have one night everyweekend for the boys to choose a movie to watch and stay up late. It was pretty good, and stretched pretty well with this series (just started the second season). They just kept wanting to see what will happen next. It is not the greatest cartoon ever for Batman, but the children like it.",1115769600,2,374,4.208333333333333
2179465,4,B00069DMC8,"Great Price if you want both series, at one time, packaging could have been better, but overall it was very decent.",1107993600,3,115,4.523809523809524
8040711,5,B00069DMC8,"Obviously we all want this. I just wish WB would come out and say if It was possible to put on bluray or not. If it's not going to happen then it'd be nice to know. Batman TAS isn't only the best cartoon I've ever seen but it's one of the best shows I've seen period. My kid is now the age I was when this came out and he loves it as much as I do but if we could watch it together in HD it would be a new experience for us both that we could enjoy for the first time together. I'll always have a place for this series in my watchlist, HD or not but until we know for sure, it's hard not to keep my hopes up.",1460851200,,607,3.606060606060606
8040712,5,B00069DMC8,"With all of the GARBAGE that gets re-released in the upgraded BLU-RAY format, you would think that the masterminds running the Warner Bros. vault that they would no doubt release what is the greatest animated series ever produced (with the exception of the Looney Tunes). Warner Bros. is totally dropping the ball on this. Batman has to be their most profitable and recognizable brand names. Unbelievable.",1421625600,2,405,5.151515151515151
8040713,5,B00069DMC8,This is most likely the greatest nostalgic cartoon.  I check weekly to see if it has been announced for blu ray. Can't wait!,1395532800,5,124,4.391304347826087
8040714,5,B00069DMC8,By far the greatest animated adaptation of one of the greatest super heroes of all time! If this does not deserve a blu ray release........ There is a problem! All comic book fans and super hero fans alike deserve this masterpiece in its highest quality.,1381017600,3,254,4.666666666666667
8040715,5,B00069DMC8,"Shut up and take my money!

This needs to be released on blu-ray as of yesterday!

I can't think of another show more deserving to get the blu-ray treatment.",1380758400,6,157,4.379310344827586
8040716,5,B00069DMC8,When is this show to be released?!! Such a great show deserves a proper Blu ray release  of the complete series,1378080000,4,111,4.285714285714286
8040717,5,B00069DMC8,"This show is definitely deserving of a bluray release. If it does get one, I'm hoping for more exclusive features. The DVDs had some excellent featurettes and it is this that I wanna see more of on the bluray version.

A lot of people are always bringing up HD on every site I see. Some say this show won't be on bluray since it predates HD. But then again, a lot of movies hat predated HD were released on bluray. I don't own them so I don't know if they were upgraded to HD or not. But if they were, maybe this show might be able to be upgraded too. Not sure though.

On the flip side though, there's more to bluray than HD. You don't need HD to have better picture quality. The Justice League bluray sets prove that. The sound quality will probably be upgraded if BTAS was ever released on bluray and that counts as well.

I already own the series on DVD. But since I own a bluray player now, I will definitely buy this if it ever came out. I hope it does.",1344816000,10,959,4.090425531914893
8040718,5,B00069DMC8,"This is without a doubt one of the best Animated TV shows out there. This has everything, atmosphere, good characters, good stories, awesome art direction, why hasn't this show been on Blu-ray yet?!",1315872000,18,198,5.03030303030303
