8413648,4,B0042FSR72,"So this video has all the kata.  They're filmed outdoors in black and white done by some well known guys to include M. Nakayama doing Unsu in the end.  The kata are shown usually from two angles, there is someone reading the same outline from JKA books saying things like ""...it consists of 20 moves done in 40 seconds..."" and reading the names of techniques that are during during the kata.  Some of the kata also show choreographed bunkai, and others don't have any bunkai.  You can also immediately notice the difference in technique, which is great for beginners who will learn that gedan barai for example looks different depending on the demonstrator based on the individual's body size and dynamics and will learn that techniques can be both effective and JKA-approved even if there are minor modifications.

My only big criticism is that the navigation is not easy.  There is no central menu, and going back between the different ""Volumes"" is a bit confusing at times, depending on your DVD player.  Things like Home Menu or Menu on your remote might not get you back to where you want to be.

I really recommend this DVD for JKA Shotokan practicioners, even if just for historic value.",1435104000,2,1194,4.734299516908212

8413651,3,B0042FSR72,"Historical monochrome vhs to DVD conversion. Very grainy poor quality. It is however ""not to miss"" for karate enthusiasts whose practice goes back to these big names in Shotokan.

My copy came as a PAL dvd and not NTSC as advertised. Luckily in my dojo I have a DVD player that plays both!",1330819200,3,289,4.452830188679245
