5026176,5,B006WQUI8K,Bogart doing comedy? Yep...and he's brilliant. A very funny film with gangster Bogart hiding out with two little old ladies who mother him not knowing he is a wanted man. He ends up saving their home from the bank liquidators. Anne Sheridan (pant pant) sparkles in this almost forgotten gem.,1363046400,,291,4.84

5026182,4,B006WQUI8K,"George Raft sure made a dumb habit of rejecting roles that Bogie would later take up and make into his own. It All Came True is another one. It's one of Humphrey Bogart's lesser known pictures, but don't sleep on it. It's sort of a departure for both Bogie and Ann Sheridan. I don't remember Sheridan showing a more gentle, vulnerable side while staying true to her cynical, street-savvy character. And Bogie, while still exhibiting that grit-teeth edge, subverts his onscreen gangster creds. Sprinkle on top a solid supporting cast of character actors and what we get is a watchable study in maudlin Americana and a send-up of the gangster genre.

The plot: Shady nightclub owner ""Chips"" Maguire (Bogie) flees into the night when his joint is raided by the police, but not before he plugs him what's ratted him out. On the lam, he inveigles (cough*blackmail*cough) his reluctant crony and ivory tickler, Tommy Taylor (Jeffrey Lynn), to take him to his mother's boarding house, a choice place to lay low, never mind that Tommy hasn't seen his mum in five years. At the boarding house, Chips (or, now, ""Mr. Grasselli"") professes to be an invalid who requires absolute privacy so as to recover from a nervous breakdown. This promptly kindles Tommy's mom's nurturing instincts.

A key subplot presents itself in the opening minutes. The boarding house, host to a number of eccentric tenants, is in dire straits. The two broke, old landladies (Una O'Connor, Jessie Busley) owe $1,189.64 in back taxes, else the bank will foreclose. It doesn't help that the hot-tempered daughter (Sheridan) of one of the landladies has come home to smooch money off her. Is it so preposterous that the reclusive new boarder can salvage the day? Mr. Grasselli, fugitive from the law and climbing the walls from sheer boredom, extends a business proposition to the lovely old birds: why not convert the boarding house into a nightclub? A bustling nightclub that hearkens back to the old-timey vaudevillian era, that recalls that turn-of-the-century nostalgia? Well, okay.

This movie was a bag of fun, rife with good comic bits and nice moments of Ann Sheridan belting out songs (my favorite is the first time she sings ""Angel in Disguise""). She's just great as the brassy canary with the warm heart, and there are moments when she just glows onscreen. The hook for me, though, is Bogie who, at this time, was a year or two away from his star-making roles in The Maltese Falcon (1941) and Casablanca (1942). Given, what Bogie does in It All Came True - the spoofing of his gangster persona - isn't a pioneering thing. George Raft (1935's She Couldn't Take It and Edward G. Robinson (1938's A Slight Case of Murder) did it before. But, here, he shows his knack for deadpan humor. You don't get a lot of chances to see Bogie poking fun at himself, and I love how, in this movie, his character retains his toughness and cynicism even as he develops a sentimental streak. It's a carefully guarded streak, mind you. Up to the film's closing scene, he's shuffling back and forth on the crossroads. Don't let the fact that this is a musical comedy sway you, or that the two old ladies view him as a kindly impresario. Chips Maguire is a hood and a straight-up killer, not to mention, a self-confessed hater of mothers. Conversely, there IS that one scene where he sings to himself a snippet of ""While Strolling Through the Park One Day."" Yeah, there's a reason Bogie doesn't sing much. Even his singing feels like he's threatening me.

Oh, yes, there's also a mild love triangle involving Sheridan, Bogart, and Jeffrey Lynn (the piano player what's ""tired of playing for peanuts and promises,"" remember him? He turns out to be Sheridan's childhood pal). I almost didn't mention this because Lynn gets so overshadowed by Bogie.

Keep an eye out for the Elderbloom Chorus, a group of sprightly old women singers. They start out with a sedate rendition of ""Silver Threads Among the Gold"" but then delightfully ramps it up with the jive ""Flat Foot Floogie.""",1397520000,,4023,4.807803468208093
5026183,5,B006WQUI8K,"IT ALL CAME TRUE (1940) is a unique film for it puts Humphrey Bogart's gangster persona in what can almost be called a musical setting. Here he's a hood who's hiding out at the mansion-like home owned by the mother of one of his employees (Jeffrey Lynn). She (Jessie Busley) and her best friend (Una O'Connor) have turned the stately old place into a boarding house seemingly for the eccentric. In fact both these ladies are a couple of Irish-accented characters who quickly take to Bogie as if he were a long-lost son.

It's in this picture that we hear him say in resigned exasperation,  ""Now I have TWO muddahs!"" (You have to see the moment to fully appreciate it.)

Zasu Pitts plays the nosy boarder down the hall, and she's great! There's also ex-vaudeville magician ""The Great Boldini"" (Felix Bressart) and his undying dream of making a comeback. Best of all is Ann Sheridan as the other old lady's daughter. She's a nightclub chanteuse who knows the truth about Bogart's shady past, but isn't saying.. at least for now. Sheridan in her vocalist role does two songs that any Boomer who grew up watching Warner cartoons will instantly recognize: ""Angel in Disguise"" and ""The Gaucho Serenade."" (Check YouTube for a movie clip of Ann singing the latter.)

This would not be the last time Bogart had a film part that combined comedy and his ""tough guy with a soft spot"" image.

The rest of the cast, including Bill Demarest, Jackie Gleason and Phil Silvers, is outstanding.

In this Michael Curtiz-directed French stageplay adaptation, Bogart, Aldo Ray and Peter Ustinov are three Devil's Island cons who take it on the lam and hide out over the Xmas holiday at the home/shop of a local merchant. They soon get involved in the lives of this man's family. Another top-shelf cast here includes Leo G. Carroll, Joan Bennett, Gloria Talbott and Basil Rathbone, who's spot-on as arrogant Andre Trochard, an overbearing boor who'll soon pay for the heartless treatment of his relatives.",1386633600,,3001,6.135714285714286
5026184,3,B006WQUI8K,"The Warners Archive series offer no frills DVDS of many films which might be unavailable otherwise. This is the upside. The downside is they are very expensive, have no extras, not even a scene selection and the prints are usually unrestored in any way.

In 1939, Anne Sheridan was promoted as the ""oomph"" girl, a publicity stunt which helped catapult her to the top but irritated her for the rest of her life. ""It All Came True,"" a 1940 Warner Brother's release, was the first film to feature her above the title and it is quite a showcase.  She easily dominates a creaky vehicle in which gangster Humphrey Bogart hides out in a boarding house run by Sheridan's Irish mother, Una O'Connor, and others. The story is corny and cute but Sheridan plays tough, romantic, dramatic and sentimental, one after the other, and steals the show. She dances a little and sings a lot so the film is a good example of her range as a performer. One song, ""Angel in Disguise,"" became a big hit and can be heard endlessly in Warner's cartoons of the period. Humphrey Bogart plays some comedy here too and he is very entertaining. The direction is featureless and the film could have done with some tighter editing to pick up the pace because some of the scenes drag a little.

The print is only adequate and the soundtrack has background noise at times. The theatrical trailer is included.",1375574400,,1372,4.614754098360656
5026185,5,B006WQUI8K,"Bogart in a comedy - who knew?! It is a comedy of a style that is no longer as popular as it once was. But it surely gives this gaggle of stars a chance to ""chew up the scenery.""",1374019200,2,178,3.58974358974359
5026186,5,B006WQUI8K,"I really enjoy all these older films and this one is up there. Bogart as a likeable not so bad bad guy who takes his ""Due"" with dignity and humor. A great script, very entertaining.",1372377600,,181,4.2

5026188,5,B006WQUI8K,"This is one of Ann Sheridan's best movies in my opinion. One of my favorite parts of the movie is when she dances and sings. Ann Sheridan was a tough cookie but I found her to be funny, cute and tough in this movie. It's her movie even though Humphrey Bogart is not too far behind in an underrated performance. He was both tough and funny. He did so many gangster movies it would have been nice to see him play more characters like this. He was mostly used as the rotten evil irredeemable gangster who both made Jimmy Cagney and Edward G. Robinson likable and is usually shot by both of them. Bogart's character was so likable and this movie was a treat.
  I didn't want to buy this due to the price but when I saw it I know I made the right decision. I've rewatched it a few times and every viewing gets better. It's a nice funny movie. It has good acting but if you are looking for an Oscar worthy movie you might want to see another movie. This is a must for Bogart fans. It's great for Sheridan fans too she was always great in They Drive By Night and Angels with Dirty Faces along with others but this is one of her best performances.

Bogart wonderful Ann Sheriden is wonderful and the treasure of the movie is Una O'Connor, an Irish actress with a great Irish brogue, feisty, loving, so funny and a pleasure to watch.

8505848,5,B006WQUI8K,"I've loved classic Hollywood movies all my life, then recently was reminded of Ann Sheridan's considerable talents in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Torrid-Zone/dp/B000MTEFX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Torrid Zone</a>. She was terrific in playing strong, funny, no-nonsense characters and also had the talent to perform in musical numbers. Naturally, I wanted to see more movies in which she starred. When I ordered this particular movie on DVD, I didn't know much about it. Then, the opening minutes of this light-hearted tale seemed a bit slow: We spend some time meeting the eccentric boarders in a New York rooming house.

But, rest assured: Ann Sheridan shows up with a bang! I won't spoil what happens but she makes short order of a would-be stalkerand we're off to the races! Bogart's entrance in this film is equally surprising. At this point in his career (1940), he was known as ""tough guy"" and often played the ""heavy"" in gangster films. Audiences still feared him from movies like the 1936 drama&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Petrified-Forest/dp/B0006HBV2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Petrified Forest</a>&nbsp;and 1937's terrific&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-End-DVD/dp/B00J2THBGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead End (DVD)</a>.

This seems to be a transitional film for Bogie. As he is introduced, he steps into a nightclub much like the gangsters he played in earlier crime classics. We see the old stereotype emerging. But, then, we realize that lets the writers immediately start to poke fun at that kind of role. Again, I won't spoil the fun by describing what happens, but Bogart's tour of the boarding house is hilarious!

In an hour and a half, this movie has everything: A shoot out. Romance. Quirky Vaudeville-style performers. Endearing character actors from Hollywood's Golden Age. Even several oddball production numbers. There's a musical revue of elderly women belting out show tunes that is sure to put a smile on your face. And, through it all, the writers are having fun with us as they twist and turn our expectations.

What a delight!",1504051200,,2674,6.809941520467836

8505851,3,B006WQUI8K,"It All Came True is a 1940 black and white musical comedy gangster film notable as one of Humphrey Bogarts last films before he became a big star. Little need be said about Humphrey Bogart (1899-1957). In the 30s, Bogart played second fiddle to Warners biggest stars James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson in films like Bullets or Ballots (1936), Kid Galahad (1937), and Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), but in 1941 Bogart starred in High Sierra and The Maltese Falcon and from that point onward, Bogart became a big name star, eventually surpassing both of them in 1943 on the tail of his performance in Casablanca. Bogart plays a mobster on the run.

The film stars sultry Ann Sheridan (1915-67) as an aspiring singer and daughter of a boarding house manager where Bogart hides out. Sheridan appeared in more than 50 films, mostly in the late 30s and 40s, where she earned the nickname Oomph Girl, before she made a move to TV. She appeared with Jimmy Cagney in Angels with Dirty Faces (1938), with Bogart in They Drive By Night (1940), with Ronald Reagan in Kings Row (1942), and with Cary Grant in I Was a Male War Bride (1949).

Jeffrey Lynn (1909-95) plays Bogarts henchman and the son of the boarding house owner. She and Sheridan have history. Lynn appeared in dozens of films in the 40s.

The film has some of the best comedians from the 40s, including Zasu Pitts, Una OConner (Sheridans mom), and Felix Bressart.

The film was directed by Lewis Seiler (1890-1964). He worked with Tom Mix in the silent era and subsequently directed nearly 100 films including Pittsburgh (1942) and Guadalcanal Diary (1943).

Somehow the romance (between Lynn and Sheridan), the comedy (Pitts, OConnor, Bressart), and the gangster (Bogart) elements don't mix in an entirely suitable manner. The NY Times said  sometimes, in a mystic limbo outside the pale of these dominant categories, there will occur an effort like ""It All Came True"" which is neither comedy, strictly speaking, nor good red gangsterism, nor an altogether creditable combination of both Variety said that the story has as many angles as a Hollywood agent.

The top grossing films in 1940 were Fantasia, Pinocchio, Rebecca, Boom Town, and Santa Fe Trail. Rebecca won for best picture, James Stewart (Philadelphia Story was best actor, and Ginger Rogers (Kitty Foyle) was best actress. Other notable films that year were westerns like Spencer Tracy in Northwest Passage, Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan in The Westerner, and Errol Flynn in Virginia City, comedies like Irene Dunne and Cary Grant in My Favorite Wife, Cary Grant and Roz Russell in His Girl Friday, and W.C. Fields as The Bank Dick and with Mae West in My Little Chickadee.

All things considered there isn't much to recommend it. Its interesting to see Bogart trying to play in the comedy, and Sheridan is always an eyeful, but otherwise your time can be better spent elsewhere.",1465430400,,2898,4.852226720647773
