8228961,2,B000XPU53Y,"I had heard positive reviews of this film before I saw it, but I was very disappointed in it. Paul Naschy stars as a troubled ex-acrobat (!) who is a prime suspect in the hunt for a killer who is murdering a string of women. Set in London, and filmed in the 1970s, the plot sees Naschy avoid capture as more and more murders happen, and the police try and catch him, and that's about as exciting as it gets.
Casing itself in the giallo mould, the film tosses in a lot of ""meaningful"" details such as a child seeing the shoes of the stalking killer, the revelation that a different knife is used for each murders, and the fact that the killer removes selected body parts from each victim. None of which particularly enhances the plot or the big reveal at the end.

The acting is all pretty poor, most notably from the women. The victims are played by women with no acting skill at all,and there's also a really terrible non-performance by a key female character who helps Naschy in the second half of the film. Naschy himself is not bad although he appears to be wearing a very bad toupee. Actually nearly all of the female parts are played by women in bad wigs as well!

The overall look of the movie is also quite poor. The print in this edition is widescreen, thankfully, but it's grubby and not very crisp. There isn't much artisty in the cinematography, many scenes are brutally lit with very harsh lighting, and a lot are overexposed. The english dub is awful, not just in the lip synching, but in the script - the lines that the characters come out with are very often hilarious. A lot of scenes are set in central London streets, and in nearly every one of them, the passers by gawp and stare directly into the camera, which totally distracts from the action, and should have been edited out. One man is even seen ducking out of the way!

I don't like being negative, but this is a very dull movie. There are a lot of murders but they are all exactly the same, an amateur actress screaming and the same close up every time of a knife digging into some rubbery fake skin in extreme close up! I have seen a lot of giallos and I am a fan of the genre, but when I sit through stuff like this I realise that it takes some skill to make what are essentially crime thrillers look stylish and suspenseful, and this movie does not have that skill.",1427328000,,2345,4.325
8228962,5,B000XPU53Y,"7 MURDERS FOR SCOTLAND YARD opens w/ a leering POV -the killer's- shot of the Soho adult theater district. A prostitute is picked up, followed, and murdered by the silent maniac. Next we are introduced to Peter Dockerman (Paul Naschy- HORROR RISES FROM THE TOMB, VENGEANCE OF THE ZOMBIES, THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THE DARK), a poor disgruntled schlub, haunted by visions of his days as a trapeze artist (!!). Dockerman's career was prematurely ended due to a fall. He now lives w/ a prostitute, and seems to know just about all of them! After his ""girlfriend"" is butchered, Dockerman really hits the skids, eventually becoming a suspect.  Meanwhile, the killer strikes again and again. Scotland Yard is running down clues, soon noticing eerie similarities between these latest murders and the Jack The Ripper case! 7MFSY is a Giallo-type thriller, complete w/ an unknown, gloved assailant, and an ocean-full of red herrings. I especially enjoyed Naschy's grim, humorless character. Contains much gruesomeness, including a ""special delivery"" package for the police, that prefigures SE7EN! A must-see for any / all Nashy film fans...",1405123200,,1125,5.181318681318682
8228963,4,B000XPU53Y,"This DVD from Substance ( also now out in the UK ) is unauthorized but is really the only way to see the film other than a rotton old Italian VHS.  This DVD was sourced from a 35 mm print of the English dubbed version, and seems to be a covered or clothed print.  In Spain at the time, some scenes would be shot twice, once with the actor wearing clothes ( covered ) and also in a nude version.
So no nudity here, but there is some violence.
Goergous Orchidea de Santis stars with Naschy, who plays a down on his luck ex circus performer who becomes a suspect in his wife's murder.  Someone is killing women and removing various organs.  This is still fairly early in Naschy's filmography and is not quite up there with his best, but fans will find plenty to enjoy.  The giallo aspects of the plot are fairly well handled ( keep in mind this film came right at the start of the Italian giallo boom ).
Maybe someday we'll see a release of the uncovered English version, btu for now this is as good as it gets.",1346976000,,1008,4.175257731958763
8228964,2,B000XPU53Y,"I was disappointed in this film. I was expecting to enjoy it, but only in parts. This film falls into the genre, ""Giallo"". It is sort of hard to find, but only for hardcore ""Giallo/Thriller"" fans.
Other rare gems to look for would be: ""The House of the Yellow Carpet"", ""The Killer Wore Gloves"", ""Cosi Dolce Cosi Perversa"", ""Eyeball"", and ""The Iguana with the Tongue of Fire"". These are worth looking for!!!",1229385600,,406,4.652777777777778
