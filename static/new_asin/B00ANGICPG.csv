5459396,5,B00ANGICPG,We have accumulated the entire series including the movies and wish there were more!  The subtitles are a big plus so you don't miss the intimate exchanges.,1371340800,,156,4.777777777777778
5459397,5,B00ANGICPG,"We have watched seasons 1-4 borrowed from the local library, season five just was made available on March 5, 2013 and the library doesn't have it yet...  We knew nothing about the series until a month ago (May 2013) when I found it at the library.  Since then we have purposed to watch each evening, of course we love it!  It is quite addictive, as is CW's Arrow series, Person of Interest, and Elementary, and of course NCIS!

The Murdoch Mystery series is delightfully different though, and that difference is important enough to hubby and I to purchase the commercial copies for our home library.  It is closer to Arrow, where the writers have developed the personal of each character to give the viewer quite a deep personal view of the family relationships as well as this kindness and compassion in the work atmosphere - during EACH episode.  The continuation of the plot builds for each character and relationship as the season plays out, however, the writers were wise and any episode could be viewed out-of-order without loss of the  storyline ruining any episode.

We LOVE the historical storyline parallel to modern day inventions!
And what a HOOT, we LOVE the constabulary office activities!

Be sure to know the character personalities are well-developed, the romance is there, but handled well, though not totally Victorian in activity! ;)

One question to those who have had chance to view BOTH DVD and Bluray discs of at least one of these episodes, we would love to know the precision difference between the DVD discs and the Bluray disc presentation.  Is it just the same answer as all other; clarity of both visual and sound?  Does anyone know if there is really a great difference between the presentations of either disc type to the eye AND ear of those around 60-years old?

I would like to also mention, though hubby and I are near, and just over 60-years old by no means is this series for old people!  The young actors are finely skilled actors and the storyline is about young people!  I urge you to support this series and ask the producers for more seasons!",1370649600,,2085,4.720994475138122
5459398,5,B00ANGICPG,"I just love this DVD and am glad that they are continuing the Series, it is great to see how Murdoch goes about solving the problems in regards to the different murders, he is the Sherlock Holmes of his times and he thinks outside the circle, putting the future and the past together in a series to solve the murders would be quite difficult as you would have to be careful to make sure it is believable to the viewer and I think they have done this with Murdoch as I said the Character's are very believable and love that Murdoch & Dr. Odgen get back together I just love both Actors performances and the supporting actors are great too.",1368662400,,638,4.325
5459399,5,B00ANGICPG,"I purchased season 1 to try and my wife and I both really enjoyed the people and the settings in Canada. The story lines and the characters are really very good, would recommend the series highly, plus the different shows are all a G rating. We bought seasons 1 thru 4 after viewing season1.",1368662400,,291,4.407407407407407
5459400,3,B00ANGICPG,"After watching Sue Thomas FB ""Eye"", I ordered this collection because Yannick Bisson (""Jack"") plays a leading role in this series too. This show doesn't have the fun cameraderie and great lines that I was hoping for, but the historical aspects are interesting and I was say it is still worth watching.",1368403200,,301,4.8076923076923075
5459401,3,B00ANGICPG,Acting is just ok. The scenery is repetitive. Plots fairly simple. Borderline boring. I would not order if I knew what I now know.,1365638400,3,130,4.458333333333333
5459402,5,B00ANGICPG,"Love the writing and how famous people of that time period are in the episodes, along with future inventions.  Thank you for such smart and enjoyable viewing experience!!
I first discovered this series on Netflix and became hooked, watching episode after episode and couldn't wait for the next to come, then discovered the 4th season on Amazon and was able to watch instantly (thanks!!).  Couldn't hardly wait for season 5, and decided I had to have this series in my collection.
You won't be disappointed!!!",1364428800,14,508,4.964705882352941
5459403,5,B00ANGICPG,"The Collection IS fantastic. SIX star worthy.

Murdoch Mysteries Collection is truly one of the finest Historical Crime TV series on TV, and it continues now with Season 5 on DVD, and season 6 is also a future reality. All wonderful news for fans of this show.
IF you have not seen any, this Collection is the way to buy at a lower price. Each of the seasons are available individually, but at a significant higher price than what this listing on Amazon is asking at present, being $111.99. Original retail was $239.96. Get them and watch in any order, but watch.

It's all about a Toronto detective from late 1890's who manages to use inventive forensic modes now common in today's crime solving venue. Historic aspects of the show are as good as period sets and costuming. Historical personalities occasionally cross paths with Murdoch (Yannick Bisson). Novel adaptations of Maureen Jennings' writing, this has become a show demanded for continuation. Always intriguing, always satisfying to the eyes and mind. An intellectual and entertaining hot fudge sundae, if they had those in 1895. Sprinkled overtop are bits of Victorian romance too. Humor as well, the series has it all.
Crabtree (Jonny Harris), Brackenreid (Thomas Craig), beautiful romantic Dr. Ogden (Helene Joy), & Higgins (Lachlan Murdoch).

SDH SUBTITLES on all 52 episodes. YES, 52, that's over 41 hours of fantastic entertainment, many guest stars, and perhaps the most unique period cop show ever produced. Better than Sherlock. DVD or Blu-Ray, content is great. Honest!

5459421,5,B00ANGICPG,"Addictive mysteries set in a time when inventions were beginning to speed life and crimefighting up.  Sort of a more refined and button-downed Hec Ramsey, with a younger handsomer and much more technically savvy hero.  Very well-written mysteries which sometimes play with real historical events and persons.  A lovely and intelligent heroine, a gruff but supportive boss, and an imaginative and steadfast constable round out the rest of the cast.  Do not binge watch, LOL.  Has a bit of a steampunk flavor though most of the inventions used in the episodes probably were invented about the time the episodes are set in.  There is a beautiful and slow-burning romance that also winds through all of the stories.  Cautions:  Has some CSI moments in the morgue, some violence, some adult themes, some Canadianism and Canadian humor that I'm sure I'm missing but overall is the TV series I just can hardly put down.  Have 1-4 (rewatching), 5-8, 9, 10 (haven't watched yet), Christmas Special #1, and Christmas Special #2 (saving for after #10).  Two thumbs way up.",1515283200,2,1061,4.9772727272727275

5459446,5,B00ANGICPG,"This series is so inventive as a historical period piece and a police procedural while also having elements of humor and romance. That the main protagonist is an upright and moral individual who sometimes struggles between the letter of the law and justice as well as doing what is right for others and following his own heart is both refreshing and frustrating at times. I also love that the Victorian setting allows for the writers to explore cultural values and norms, which we take for granted now.

The production values adhere to a standard of excellence, and the cast is fabulous in fleshing out the personalities of their roles. Any chance they can keep producing this series forever? (I'm now on my third viewing of the series from start to finish in the past two months!)",1512604800,,781,4.742647058823529
5459447,5,B00ANGICPG,"Murdoch mysteries is a delight in many ways. Its 1900 Toronto is a spiffy, delightful city with large Victorian mansions, huge flowering gardens, clean streets, and, seemingly, no poverty. In short, a fantasy-----what we want this era to be. This fantasy continues in the costuming, especially the women's hats; they are tongue in cheek as is the whole production. Wry humor, subtle jokes connecting that past to our own time are fun to ferret out as the episodes continue. Murdoch himself is eye candy. He is extremely handsome, dedicated to his job, his religion and his Julia. The opposite of most detective in our current 21st century based tv dramas.  HIs three piece suits are a particular relief to our shabby unpressed world. Sometimes melodramatic, sometimes fall down funny or quaint. But it does get serious at times as when it deals with the era's laws against birth
control, abortion, women's rights. Watch it. You'll love the fantasy that sometimes gives way to humor and a way of evaluating how laws and expectations have changed since then.",1512000000,,1056,4.966101694915254
5459448,5,B00ANGICPG,Murdock is an amazing series. Some issues in storyline show a parallel of my own life so it makes the story/show that much more interesting and intriguing to me.,1511740800,,161,4.586206896551724

5459465,5,B00ANGICPG,"The series takes place in early 20th century Canada. It's a mix of famous inventions/technology with top notch stories and sleuthing. The acting is superb, the indoor sets are very well done and the outside scenes are so realistic. There's a lot of ""pushing the envelope"" with female doctors who run the local morgue (and are love interests) for the main detective and a constable, spying (with emphasis on US/Canada jurisdictional squabbles) and lots of colorful cameos by famous inventors, writers, etc. I think they just finished the eleventh season.",1506816000,,553,5.155555555555556

I first started watching this program every day at 5pm on CBC, when I moved into the Charter /Spectrum cable TV area.  CBC has such amazing programs that I have no idea why other satellite or cable networks don't pick it up.  This program is just one example.  If you don't live in an area where CBC is available, I strongly recommend that you start from the beginning and order seasons 1-4 of Murdock Mysteries.

5459508,5,B00ANGICPG,"The Artful Detective (Murdoch Mysteries) is right up there with the intrigue, unique story lines and visual beauty of Midsomer Murders. This series is set in the late 1800's-early 20th Century which gives a different twist in crime. A far cry from the hampered, PC environment in which police must operate today. The criminals don't get a free-pass via liberal judges. Law and Order prevails in non-socialist Canada of that day, as it also was in the USA of those times. Love the characters, the acting and  the old-fashion dresses. The women of those times actually were educated- doctors, lawyers, newspaper reporters and spoke out even while the Suffragettes  were fighting for the vote. It makes you wonder when and who invented the alleged ""Glass Ceiling?"" LOL",1495756800,,765,5.015748031496063

5459512,5,B00ANGICPG,There are many TV series which we have come to love and Murdoch Mysteries must rank among the very best. They give the viewer much to reflect on from this second decade of the 21st century while looking at life in a major North American city at the end of the 19th century! I find myself watching episodes more than once to absorb their richness. Highest recommendation. In some way the series calls to mind the treatment of Glasgow in Taggart and its more than 100 episodes.,1494374400,,475,4.471264367816092

5459525,4,B00ANGICPG,"I'm on the fence with this series as I like the time period it's set in and the mysteries themselves are good. I guess what's unbelievable is the fact the Murdoch seems to have invented every crime detection method and tool that was every discovered. I'm waiting for the episode where he contemplates the possibility of DNA and how it might help in solving crimes. I know this series has Murdoch being like a Sherlock Holmes (and a Sir Arthur Conan Doyle character appears in several episodes getting ideas for future Holmes stories), but I'd prefer if they concentrated more on the Murder mystery stories themselves than Murdoch's inventions.",1488672000,,643,4.908256880733945

5459530,5,B00ANGICPG,"Brilliant show. A police procedural set in late 1800/early 1900 Toronto. We see Detective Murdoch of station 4 solve all kinds of crimes. He is also a bit of a scientist and makes things like luminol and UV light to ""see"" blood, a recording device for interviews, develops ""finger marks"" (we call them prints now) and a series of card pictures so witnesses can build a picture of who they saw. We quite literally see Murdochs mind at work - as he thinks you see several versions of him going around a crime scene as he works out different scenarios. If that wasn't interesting enough many famous folk are woven into the stories. Nicola Tesla, Edison, H G Wells, Houdini and Arthur Conan Doyle to name a few. Murdoch is assisted by Constable Crabtree (played by the hilarious Jonny Harris) who is always making some madcap idea-trying to figure out words on a page he thinks you could make a game out of it and call it ""something like Scramble""! (He almost comes up with a frisbee and ""clue"" to name a few). Of course Crabtree's colleagues think his ideas are crazy. We have the lovely coroner Dr Julia Ogden (also Murdochs love interest). It's great to see a woman in this role-she points out herself how rare it is for a woman to even get accepted into medical school. Her and Murdochs affair is a significant back story-Murdoch is so wonderfully awkward he can never seem to get the courage to really make a move on Julia (it's a slow burn but great to watch!). Really can't recommend this enough. It's light hearted and funny - but can be somber as the police work through the hate/ill will/family dramas that lead to the crimes. So glad Canadian TV approved more series",1485907200,6,1673,4.543046357615894
5459531,5,B00ANGICPG,"Dear Canada:

I hate you.  Really, I do. I was content to sit and watch reruns of Leverage, Star Trek, and the occasional splice of Doctor Who. Then... y'all make this crap. Seriously? You hate me too, I know it.  I caught this on Netflix and though, oh.. might well try this show since I'm getting ready to relinquish my stomach content if I have to watch ANOTHER rerun. Now, after watching Seasons 1-7 three+ times each and reading the Book about how the TV Show is made, I'm starting for a fourth time...

Why?  Why did you do this to me? I didn't hate you before! You had snow.. and steak.. and (from what I hear) some place called Tim Hortons that might sell donuts.  You had Hockey and mountains and lake born ice storms. And you kept a positive attitude....

Now, I truly despise that you have made this TV show as I cannot seem to find my way to stop watching... I'd ask you to stop making it but... don't... please... keep making the shows... or more TV movies with the staff...

Btw, fix Crabtree up with someone and make it stick.  Just don't have them named after a flower.. That would be creepy.

Signed,
Me (not the Doctor Who Me, just me).

p.s., I'm not gonna put reviews on the other products, I'll just tell people to see this one.  I lazy. Just don't be mad when I show up for a vacation up there.

p.p.s, Send me an audio track of Doctor Ogden saying ""William"" and I'll forgive ya... just kidding...

5459545,5,B00ANGICPG,"It took me a couple of tries watching this show to get into it.  I didn't really care for it, to be honest.  Then on the third or fourth try, I was hooked.  I became invested with the characters and wanted to see what happened next.  The channel I watch them on don't play them in canonical order, so I've never seen them in any sort of story order, but that really doesn't matter to me.  The characters are extremely well written and are completely relatable even though it takes place at the turn of the century.  You can see something of yourself in them as they navigate through the revolutionary times.  The story lines are fresh and engaging and very relevant to todays society.  I also like that its filmed in Canada, so I get to see a lot of my favorite Canadian actors guest star, also some unexpected American stars.  I fully recommend it as a series to watch to anyone.",1476316800,,880,4.3496932515337425

5459560,5,B00ANGICPG,"We got hooked on Murdoch watching old episodes on one of our local TV stations.  The setting is Toronto in the late 1890s [and now in the latest years] the early 1900s.  So, I bought all the seasons from 1 through 8 [the first four in this package and the next four as individual years].  It is a quirky police procedural with a small core cast of about a dozen regulars.  And, there are a few guests who show up about once or twice a season.  And almost every other episode, there is a reference to a future invention, as was the case with a giant machine that could cook people from a great distance.  And, Constable Crabtree, who gets most of the great straight face lines in the series, sees houses with a room set aside just for cooking using these microwaves.  Who knows, they speculate about even cooking a potato.

Also, you have a variety of guests who pop in 0 some for a single episode and others for several episodes.  In year eight there are a couple of episodes featuring women's suffrage.  And, in one a little girl tells a lady who has run for Parliament, that she hopes to grow up someday and run herself.  The name of the little girl in the episode was the actual name of the first lady to be elected to Canada's Parliament about 20 years after the time of this particular episode.

I can hardly wait for year 9 to appear on DVD in August.",1466985600,,1357,4.2784313725490195

5459568,5,B00ANGICPG,"It is the cast and characters that make these episodes so delightfully compelling.  The weekly mysteries combined with the subplots keep the viewer interested and in close relation with the entire cast.  It is clearly apparent that the actors are enjoying their roles.  Murdoch's subtle humor along with his deep sincerity add color to the stories.  These are what I call ""light-hearted"" murder mysteries because they are entertaining and the main characters are optimistic and positive in the outlook on life.  The fact that they are set around the turn of the last century is another plus.  Period pieces nearly always appeal.",1462406400,,628,5.107843137254902

The stories are well-done with wit and humor as well as some tear-jerking too.

5459611,4,B00ANGICPG,"This was a Christmas present for my 12-year-old, who is in love with 'Murdoch Mysteries'. The series is a throwback to the turn of the century in Toronto, Canada, as Det. William Murdoch of the Toronto Constabulary (forerunner to the Metropolitan Toronto Police) solves crimes using early investigative methods that today's CSI people would have been proud of. Along the way, Murdoch often touched base with prominent historical figures, including Alexander Graham Bell and Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Prominent guest stars included Victor Garber ('Titanic') and even current Prime Minister Stephen Harper in a cameo role in Season 4. Murdoch also found himself facing very human problems such as his relationship with coroner Dr. Julia Ogden as well as the odd run-in with is boss, Inspector Brackenreid, but found himself a great ally in eager co-worker Constable Crabtree.

This is a great series that is still going strong today. I expect I will pick up more seasons later on.",1444780800,,973,5.158227848101266

5459633,5,B00ANGICPG,"I came across The Artful Detective on Ovation and instantly became a fan.  I came in late in Season 4 and have watched all the subsequent seasons, some episodes more than once.

I ordered seasons 1-4 and was gratified to find that the series started out fully formed with well-developed main characters from the very first episode.  The episodes range from dark and somber to a comedic romp and there was the inclusion of historic figures and introduction of recurring characters such as James Pendrick, Terence Meyers (and ""Concession 51,) Darcy Garland and arch-villain James Gillies.  The episodes are crafted such that I had no feeling of having missed anything by not watching seasons 1-4 first.  Further, I appreciate how much the stable of gifted writers has contributed to this show's success.

Now that I am all caught up, I will content myself with re-watching favorite episodes while waiting for season 9.  (I'm confident that George Crabtree, Edna and Simon will all be exonerated.)

For me, The Artful Detective is an oasis in the vast wasteland of television.",1438732800,,1073,4.98876404494382

When we got it, we started over at the beginning and are enjoying each episode all over again and looking forward to the three seasons we haven't seen.

As the episodes I was seeing most definitely showed evolving relationships among the characters, I decided to purchase earlier seasons if they were evailable so I could start from the beginning.

5459678,5,B00ANGICPG,"My review of the show

I love the show every season gets better.  It had a slow start with the first episode, but most series do.  It's a mystery show set in the late 1800s, just before the turn of the century in Canada. It's based on Canadian historical fiction.  It is a CSI show set in the past with the technology of the day.  The series is clever and interesting.

Review of the DVD set 1-4

I heard that there is no closed captioning, but it's subtitled and works with my blue-ray player.  I guess it doesn't work with the closed captioning on your television, but I'm not sure why that would matter.

The DVD does seem quieter than it should on our old sound system, but on our new one it's pretty loud.  We watch it on a movie projector.

We only had one glitch, their voices on a DVD on series 4 didn't match their moving lips.  I turned it off and on again and then it was fine.

There is no booklet that describes the episodes and they do not describe the episodes on the DVD.  They list the episodes on each DVD on the episode selection page and show silent clips of each episode, showing you key things that happen under the title of each episode.  I think this would only be annoying if you weren't watching them straight through and were look for specific episode and didn't know what season it was on.  It doesn't bother me to look it up on imdb.com.com",1426982400,,1369,4.227799227799228

The first three books were made into movies about 2002 to 2005, prior to this TV series if I recall correctly, with different actors. These movies are expected to go on the market late spring of 2015, according to the author's web site. We purchased the DVD's through season 7 and we will most certainly l buy future DVDs when they come out.

I read the books on my Kindle after we watched the TV series. The difference is very interesting...I will say that the author does a great job of research and the use of dialog and vocabulary: Did Canadians at the turn of the century really talk like this?",1426118400,,648,4.355371900826446

And I cancelled my TV service more than 6 years ago, disgusted with the reality, the cop shows and the ever downward dumbing down that American TV has served up for us.  So, for the past several years, we have looked for entertaining DVDs that were the best of the best for an hour in the evening.  We were not just pleasantly pleased with Murdock, it is a treasure.  There are great historical, scientific and industrial elements woven into many of the plots, which are used by Murdock and the rest of the cast to shed light on their cases.  And while it IS a murder mystery series, it is not grizzly in any real way, so my 11 year old only gets squeamish with the few tame love scenes shown.  So now, I have all Seven of the series and my only disappointment is that they do not do twice (or five times) more stories each year.  Want engaging, well plotted entertainment?

5459728,1,B00ANGICPG,I love Murdock Mysteries. What I DO NOT LIKE is Acorn Media's rendition of these. There is no indication on the disc which episodes are on the disc. The sound is terrible. I have two CD players and on BOTH the sound needed to be turned up almost the maximum to hear it. There are only 3-4 episodes on a disc.

All police officers should be so handsome and debonaire. I can't wait to watch all of them and the on going romance between Murdoch and the pathologist. Murdochs superior, the inspector, is surly, gruff, rough, and surprisingly supportive of Murdochs efforts.

Murdoch is mellow & fairly quiet but a great thinker & tinkerer, always working with new technologies and ideas to help him solve cases. Crabtree & Brackenreid provide lots of fun & comic relief. Murdoch's relationship w/Dr. Ogden is palpable. They are really cute together, until she goes off & gets married to someone else (what?). The cases are fun & unusual. They bring in characters from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle & Tesla  to Henry Ford & Edison. Unlike many of the shows on TV today, esp American shows I don't feel like I have to be teenaged & have ADD to watch it. The actors do not all look like gorgeous models (not that many of them aren't attractive, they are, but they are mostly normal, people next door not all glamorous, tanned & super thin), there are not constant chase scenes & explosions, there is a just an unfolding of the case and evidence in order to find a killer.

5459755,1,B00ANGICPG,"Very early on we find out that Murdoch is a Roman Catholic who frequents the sacraments and apparently lives his faith. But one show after another moral issues come up and he fails to speak out or just caves in completely. It's not believable that someone with a very logical mind who always has the answers would be stumped by the lamest objections to the Church's teaching on mediums, homosexuality, abortion, contraception, prostitution, etc. Season after season I watched him gradually lose faith in the Church on every issue, egged on by the woman he supposedly loves, until finally he has to make a choice between an adulterous relationship with her and fidelity to God. Well it was pretty predictable which he would choose, considering that he Never had the backbone to stand up for his beliefs. He'll probably continue to make the Sign of the Cross when he sees a dead body, but it takes more than that to make a Catholic.",1411516800,9,930,4.711656441717792

5459761,3,B00ANGICPG,"This is a TV series from Canada and I gave it a rating of ""okay"" for the following reasons:
The production cost seems to be very limited as much of the series takes place in the same studio backlot.
The feel of the series is also low budget Saturday afternoon quality like the old Highlander and Forever Knight series.
Most of the characters lack depth and seem like cartoon characters.
The lead actor is way too tan, wears way too much eyeliner and seems overly stiff.
The plot of each story is pretty much the same (the evil Americans did it). That is the part that I really did not like about this series, if anything went wrong in their little town it was the Americans who did it and that really sucks. It totally put me off and when I noticed that this theme kept popping up it became very annoying making the show unenjoyable.

While murder and other dark topics are covered and the main characters have to fight their own demons in this series, hopefulness and a positive spirit remain and there is even humor and wit thrown into the mix.

Using discoveries and inventions from that time period to solve crimes, and set in the context of that period's political and  cultural issues make for interesting stories.",1410048000,4,522,4.853932584269663

5459781,5,B00ANGICPG,"I'm glad I took a chance on MURDOCH MYSTERIES COLLECTION: SEASONS 1-4 BLURAY set. It was offered as a Gold Box deal a while back and I kept seeing it advertised in Acorn Media's catalog, so I was curious and bit. For some reason I thought that this was a series that takes place in the UK -- I've been watching other British mysteries (Poirot, Marple, Rosemary & Thyme, Hetty Wainthropp Investigates) -- and I wanted a show to bridge the gap until the final Poirot series comes out and so I chose MURDOCH MYSTERIES.

The show actually takes place in Toronto, Canada, during the Victorian era (1890s), and even though I was a little disappointed at first I got into the series fairly quickly and now I'm hooked!

Since it takes place in the late 1890s there are no computers or any of the modern conveniences that crime fighters use nowadays and so it's up to detective William Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) to come up with very clever ideas and devices to help solve the crimes (they foreshadow real items that do come into play today). Whereas another show I enjoy SHERLOCK brings those characters into modern times this one is the opposite. Although it isn't necessarily a unique idea to set these characters at the turn of the last century it places them far enough back in history that most investigative techniques and gadgets are in their infantile stages, if thought of at all, and so this allows Murdoch -- who reminds me of a Victorian era ""MacGyver"" -- create all sorts of unique and interesting devices.

The four main characters Detective Murdoch (Bisson), the crotchety Inspector-boss Thomas Brackenreid (Thomas Craig), bumbling but clever in his own right Constable George Crabtree (Jonny Harris), and modern free-thinking pathologist Dr. Julia Ogden (Hlne Joy), make a great combination and the actors have fantastic rapport with each other. As the series goes on another character gets added, Constable Henry Higgins (Lachlan Murdoch), and he provides support to the ""Crabtree"" character.

There is romantic tension between Murdoch and Ogden, but it isn't sappy, and lots of conflict develops between them as the series goes on and you're constantly wondering and rooting for them to end up with each other.

In the meantime, Murdoch and company encounters famous/infamous people from the past including Nikola Tesla, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Buffalo Bill Cody, Anni Oakley, and H.G. Wells among others, some popup from time to time throughout all four seasons, and that's another interesting plot device. Also, the characters are always working, whether day or night, and you'd think that would stretch credulity, but I don't mind it at all.

The costumes and scenery are fantastic and I like how they do this bird's eye view shot of what looks like a still photo of Toronto at that time and superimpose people walking about, so you get the sense of what the area looked like back then and how these characters live and work and in what context .

I've never read the books or seen the other versions of ""Murdoch,"" so I don't know how well this show stands up to the original.

Can't wait for season 7 to be released.  This is one Canadian show I wish we could get as it's being shown to our neighbors up North.",1399334400,2,570,4.035714285714286
5459846,4,B00ANGICPG,Not like Sherlock but it kept us wanting to see what each episode was like. Unusual series and just different enough to make viewing enjoyable. We would purchase more of Murdoch Mysteries and would recommend to friends and family. Great actors but wish he could get rid of the bike and use a different mode of transportation!,1399161600,,325,4.719298245614035
5459847,5,B00ANGICPG,We started watching Murdoch a few seasons ago and had missed these earlier seasons so we bought them to catch up. We love the scientific aspect to each episode and the period details. We think the actors do a very fine job and we have become rather attached to them and their fates :),1399161600,2,284,4.277777777777778
5459848,5,B00ANGICPG,I bought this series for a Christmas present for my husband.  We both really love this series.  It was so unusual for a mystery series.  The characters and actors are wonderful.  The writing of this series to include science is spectacular.  I wish it went on longer,1398988800,,266,4.574468085106383
5459849,5,B00ANGICPG,"I like the Murdoch Mysteries because, even though the stories are based in Victorian Toronto, Detective William Murdoch is a man with one eye toward the future.  Besides using his shrewd mind to seek out murderers, he is constantly experimenting with gadgets that can enhance the practice of crime detection.

In a number of episodes, he encounters real historical figures like Arthur Conan Doyle and exchanges ideas with these celebrities.  This adds to the authenticity of the stories.",1398816000,,487,5.217948717948718

5459852,5,B00ANGICPG,First came across this series as The Artful Detective on Ovation channel.  Absolutely love it and had to have more.  I subsequently ordered seasons 5 and 6 and am awaiting season 7 (which I believe is now running in Canada).  I also heard they were renewed for Season 8 and I am delighted.  Can't recommend it highly enough.,1397520000,2,324,4.5344827586206895
5459873,5,B00ANGICPG,"What a fun and wonderful show. I picked this up for two reasons the many 5 star reviews and the great bluray price. So even though I had never seen this show I gave it a try and can tell you, I was not dissappointed.
The show is well put together and the actors go through the episodes with just the right amount of humor and drama. The show is a police show but takes a lot from Sherlock Holmes right down to having Conan Doyle show up. I can tell you this was money well spent and time watching it is also well spent.
Never heard of most of the cast before but I hope they stay going with this show for years to come. I feel safe in recommending this show for those who like police shows well acted and written and are not bothered that it also has it's light moments.",1396656000,5,770,4.0064935064935066

Great TV Series. Picture quality great on all BluRay's.  If you like mysteries you will enjoy this series.  I really like that it is set in turn-of-the-century Canada.  Easy watching, good for family night viewing.

Highly recommended.

If you just order one series, you will want to order others after viewing the first one.

Next weekend,.,, the second season.

Good mystery series - Eh?  I like the historical characters in to sub plots.  Seems Murdoch invented everything, before it was marketed, but,,, it's entertainment.  I'll give them a break.  Not like Edison actually MADE all the things he patented.  People worked for him and turned over the patent rights - - for their paycheck.  Still goes on.",1395014400,,459,4.7215189873417724

5459903,5,B00ANGICPG,"I read many stellar reviews for this series but was hesitant to take a chance on it. Finally, I did. I then put on the first episode and was not quite as blown away as I expected to be. Then several hours later I realized that I had just watched the first five episodes straight through. How did THAT happen? Because I had a blast watching them! I very quickly came to like all the characters, was very entertained by the charming writing and found the stories/mysteries to have a unique feel to them. The time period, location and occasional inclusion of historical figures really gave this show a fresh perspective on the crime story. The episodes have a light and fun feel to them, but some of the stories are fairly serious stuff. I would describe the series as very family-friendly, but I'm inclined to recommend an adult watch them first before viewing them with young teens. That's just my opinion, though.

The blu-ray picture quality is excellent, helped by the interesting and beautiful locations. The sound is only stereo, but it worked just fine. Like I said, I was greatly surprised and pleased by this purchase and am planning to get the rest of this series as soon as possible.",1394755200,4,1192,4.622641509433962

5459906,5,B00ANGICPG,"This series is a ""light hearted, sometimes comical version of a Victorian Era Toronto Constabulary and its challenges as it tries to solve the crimes of the day. My wife also enjoyed this actor, Yannick Bisson, in the series ""Sue Thomas F.B.Eye"", a modern ""Americanized"" version of this Victorian series of ""Who Done Its""...a slower and less explosive version of Robert Downey Jr's Sherlock Holmes.
I was happy to buy this four season set on Amazon.com for her because it was half the price as offered by Amazon .ca
which more than compensated the difference in our dollar values and the fact that I had to pay for the shipping to my Canadian address.

5459965,5,B00ANGICPG,"We have started watching ""The Murdoch Mysteries"" on TV. This series caught our attention due to the fact that the series treated the 'police procedural' topic in a new, very effective manner. I liked the connections to the great scientists, inventors, and literary characters of the 1890's-1900's. The dynamics between the principal characters in this series really entertain the viewers without resorting to the usual gimmicks seen in the modern 'procedurals'. A few minor gripes with the DVD's produced for 'Murdoch' are firstly the variance in picture quality between scenes, and secondly the 'bare bones' menu. We will try the Blu-Ray versions of 'Murdoch' in order to see if these minor concerns have been addressed. All in all, a really great show!!",1389052800,,755,5.19672131147541

5459970,5,B00ANGICPG,"I was first acquainted with this series when it was shown on Ovation network under the title of ""The Artful Detective"". I had a hard time finding it under this title. I really enjoy well-done period mysteries, especially when they are as true to life (in the period) as these are, peopled with colorful characters and entertaining mysteries. My favorite is probably going to be ""The annoying red planet"", although a couple of others run close. Word of warning here: if you are expecting modern (PC) sensibilities of sensitive subjects like abortion, cross dressing, civil rights or  gay rights you won't find it here. As a person who likes history to include all the warts and imperfections, I found this series delightful.

5459985,5,B00ANGICPG,"I discovered Murdoch Mysteries on Ovation TV (under the name ""The Artful Detective""), where I doubt it will get much promotion and it will be very difficult for the U.S. audience to discover in the ""high numbers wasteland"" of cable TV. This series is a terrific mix of slightly-steampunk Victorian costume drama, MacGyver-tech police procedural, X-Files-meets-Scooby-Doo unmasking of the supernatural, and clever mysteries and secret histories sprinkled with quirky comic moments and all the struggles of true love. Murdoch Mysteries has the addictive quality of genre TV even as it defies or transcends all categories. It crosses the intelligence of British TV with the pacing and eye candy of American TV, and produces a miraculous hybrid.

Murdoch Mysteries is set in Toronto, which for most U.S. viewers will be the equivalent of another planet, but this isn't ""alienating"" at all -  the time period is familiar enough that the location could be Any City in the Victorian Era. Better yet, this series is Mom-safe: the humor doesn't go near the toilet (though it often finds its way into the morgue) and the modernizing values are cloaked in old-fashioned courtesy. In fact, I bought this series for my Mom for Christmas, and I know she's going to love it. Yet there's plenty for younger demographics to enjoy, from clockpunk gadgets to shipping favorite couples. (Though I must admit that the show occasionally teeters into rather awkward fan service on the shipping front - I'd rather see the passionate kiss than Constable Crabtree musing on when those crazy kids will get together.) Also, there is enough ""angst"" and outright depressing turns of events to enthrall the moodiest of Millennials. What more can the sick-of-reality-TV jaded American TV watcher ask?

Murdoch Mysteries is now in its 7th season in Canada, where the show is a big hit and the quality remains high. I just hope it will somehow be discovered by American viewers soon so the syndication money will pour in, and this wonderful show will continue for years to come.",1387152000,2,2044,5.041420118343195

5459991,5,B00ANGICPG,"Great entertainment and very interesting. It has a lot of side plots and period references. The love interest is a bit awkward, but doesn't detract greatly from the total effect.",1386288000,,178,4.966666666666667
5460002,5,B00ANGICPG,"What a wonderful series.  The characters are wonderful, the cases are interesting and the time period is very beautifully depicted.  The sets are lovely and the costumes are very authentic looking.  It is not violent or gratuitously gory despite being a murder solving drama.  Has a very "" live theatre experience"" to the viewing.  If you enjoy Agatha Christie or Sherlock Holmes, you will likely enjoy this as well.  Also deals with many themes we still struggle with in a forward thinking manner for that time period, yet still thought provoking for our own.  Examples include racism, abortion, women's equality, and religious issues to mention a few.  The main character is a decent man, and a highly moral character who is open minded to the individual struggles others face.  He has compassion and understanding.  And he is also very easy on the eyes!  They also incorporate many inventions and historical characters into the plots.  Quality programming appropriate for all but the youngest ages.",1385510400,,1001,5.07361963190184
5460003,2,B00ANGICPG,"My husband and I were misled by all the reviewers who ""loved"" this show.  It is REALLY boring.  I have fallen asleep during two of the episodes, and the second time, I did not bother to watch the next day to see what I had missed.  I didn't care.  The characters are not appealing.  The plots are not interesting.  We ""love"" good detective shows.  We thoroughly enjoyed Morse, Lewis, and now Endeavor.  We are fans of Frost, George Gently, Prime Suspect, Cracker, and even Midsomer Murders.  We enjoy period shows such as Foyle's War, Poirot, Joan Hickson's Miss Marple, and Nero Wolfe, another Canadian show.  (Some of the actors from Nero Wolfe appear in Murdoch Mysteries.)  THIS SHOW WAS A WASTE OF OUR MONEY.  We have not gotten all the way through season one, yet when I suggest to my husband that we watch an episode of this show, he suggests watching reruns of another show instead.  And I am relieved.  Would anyone like to have our copy?

P.S.  I do not often give reviews, unless I feel strongly that my opinion may make a difference to someone who shares my viewing interests.",1384905600,9,1088,4.5595854922279795
5460004,5,B00ANGICPG,"My husband found this series a little late into this last season.  Once we got hooked on what was available, I ordered the earlier ones to see what we missed and we are both thrilled that we did.  Excellent Early Victorian CSI Mystery series - but much more!  It has everything!  Intrigue, twists and turns to keep everyone guessing, mini-romances that often act like glue to hold your interests looking for more and lots of Victorian frustration!  Everything is set in early Toronto, Canada in the late 1890's.  You have to ""like"" English-based themes to try this one on but if you have a love of History and want to see what it was like living during that time period, you get that and much, much more, as well.  The perspective is ""God Save The Queen based - very Protestant - Canada.""  The main Character, William Murdoch is quiet, yet very persistent in his pursuit of the truth.  There's creative tension as well as prejudices of the time.  Very insightful.",1384905600,,963,4.6117647058823525
5460005,5,B00ANGICPG,I just by chance caught the Murdoch stories on TV and became intrigued with the characters as well as the mysteries.  Now I can enjoy the stories anytime and want.  What makes my purchase even better is the stories are in chronological order not out of order like on the TV show.,1384387200,,279,4.346153846153846
5460006,5,B00ANGICPG,"This series is one of the best on TV.  Leave it to the Canadians to produce a must see show.  Great stories with fabulous acting.  The cast is perfect.  Especially enjoy Thomas Craig as Inspector Brackenreid.  Great period piece with historical figures make the show very enjoyable.  I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan forever and these stories are as good, if not better. I recommend this series to young and old.  Great family entertainment.  There is nothing off color or distasteful -- it's just a wonderful series.",1384214400,,516,4.850574712643678
5460007,5,B00ANGICPG,Wonderful!  We love it!!  We have watched them all twice!!!  Our family would highly recommend them - they are good clean fun!!!,1383782400,,128,4.7272727272727275
5460008,5,B00ANGICPG,"These cd's arrived perfectly and in record time.
They are amazing stories and I can't stop watching. They are my
healthy addiction. Yannick Bosson is awesome.",1383436800,,158,5.115384615384615
5460009,5,B00ANGICPG,"Very entertaining.  Only rarely misdirects to personal information and pretty much sticks with story and good plotting. Interesting settings, lots of machinery and inventions to enjoy.",1382832000,,184,6.076923076923077
5460010,5,B00ANGICPG,"Came across this series when re-broadcast in the US as The Artful Detective and fell in love with it - the characters are delightful and the the incorporation of (relatively) authentic events, inventions, and conventions of the time are intriguing.  Rarely do I purchase television shows on DVD or download, but I picked up seasons 1 - 5 and, considering the 'plot twist' on the last episode, am eagerly awaiting 6!",1382400000,,415,4.845070422535211
5460011,5,B00ANGICPG,"Absolutely love the writing and acting.  Little different than your average mystery.  Intend to purchase the other seasons.
Have not watched the entire 4 seasons yet.",1381363200,,166,5.346153846153846
5460032,5,B00ANGICPG,"A nice change from high-tech questionable tv shows on today.  Love the history of forensics, even if shown with literary license.  A charming Canadian import.",1381190400,3,158,5.28
5460033,5,B00ANGICPG,"I really love all the characters.  The stories are sophisticated, historically interesting and very believable.  Can't wait for number 6 to arrive.",1381017600,,147,5.636363636363637
5460034,5,B00ANGICPG,A detective far from perfect eventually always gets his man. Most of the episodes are first rate. I highly recommend them,1379808000,3,121,4.809523809523809
5460035,5,B00ANGICPG,I look forward to watching these episodes each night.  Will definitely have to get the next season 5 after this as these are so good.  Once again feel as though I have discovered a treasure.,1378944000,3,190,4.4
5460036,5,B00ANGICPG,Love Canadian Mysteries especially how Murdoch solves the cases.  We started watching it up in Canada while visiting family. As soon as we came home we had to buy all the seasons.,1378598400,3,179,4.59375
5460037,5,B00ANGICPG,"This is a great take on the standard police/CSI-type drama.  Wonderfully Canadian and yet funny for our American friends too.  We currently live in the states and have friends here that love the show (although there is the odd reference that they might not get).  One thing is for sure, you will be entertained.",1378166400,4,311,4.722222222222222
5460038,5,B00ANGICPG,This is one of the showes I wish we had here in the U.S.A.  Hopefully PBS might pick up on it.  It's a nice program to watch and the characters are great.  The show is well written and acted.  It's not full of shoot 'em up and big chase scenes but the coroners table might not be for small children.,1377907200,,299,3.933333333333333
5460039,5,B00ANGICPG,"I have to say, I jumped on this bandwagon along with everyone else who watches these shows.  Great period background and the cast is perfect.  I thought after watching the three movies that I wouldn't like a change in the lead character, but after watching two episodes, the change was seamless.  I like the twists that always seem to pop up right at the end, you think you have the culprit figured out and wham!  Totally turn in the road.  I also like the storylines, using turn of the century new advancements in solving crime that only a few seem to accept readily.  Fingerprinting, insect larvae age, etc., it all adds to the great entertainment.  It seems like you sit down, start the show and before you know it, it's ending.  Now that is both great story telling, and acting.  If you are into mysteries and are looking for older settings and BBC can't air enough Masterpiece Theatre to quench your thirst, these are a definite buy--and a fantastic deal at this price.  Entertainment at it's best!",1376956800,33,1003,4.6158192090395485
5460040,5,B00ANGICPG,"I absolutely adore Murdoch Mysteries! Nearly every episode is enchanting and clever, and the characters are like good friends (except for Julia, who is like a cheese grater on my nerves). The detectives use old-fashioned C.S.I. type investigative techniques (while making little jokes to the modern audience about it), and there are real-life characters such as H.G. Wells and Nikola Tesla on some of the episodes, since they were alive during the time period in which the show takes place. I gobbled up the first 5 seasons as if they were gourmet Fettucini Alfredo, and now I'm going to get my garlic bread (season 6). I can hardly wait to devour it!",1375660800,28,651,4.821428571428571

5460063,5,B00ANGICPG,"When we signed up for Netflex I scanned all the titles and chose this one because I like the Victorian Era.  What I didn't count on was how much I would enjoy this series.  I asked my husband to watch it with me because we never agree on what to watch (he's into all those CSI type shows).  We both loved it from the start.  The set designs, the period costumes, the story lines, the early forensic investigations and most of all the personalities and interactions of all the main characters who work in a Toronto police station during the late 1800's.  We couldn't wait until we watched the next episode.  When I realized that Netflex would no longer show Murdoch Mysteries (they only aired Seasons 1-3 until early July of 2013), I searched Amazon and ordered this collection and Season 5.  You can be certain that I will be looking forward to Season 6 (2012-2013) and Season 7 (2013-2014) .  I only hope that Murdoch Mysteries continues for a long time.  This program is produced by CBS in Canada; why doesn't CBS air this wonderful entertaining program in the United States instead of all the ""reality? junk"".  I recommend this program to anyone with good taste, who longs for bygone days.",1374278400,77,1192,4.580188679245283
5460064,5,B00ANGICPG,"Too bad we can't get this in America (what exactly is wrong with BBC America?)  I first saw a few episodes of this series while on vacation in Vancouver, B.C., and fell in love with the actors, the settings, and the stories.  It is billed as a ""1890s CSI.""  Good description:  innovative and creative.  You have to get this boxed set and start with Season One, Episode One, and follow it through in order to fully appreciate the excellent story lines and characters. And Amazon's price is far better than anywhere else you can get it!  Don't miss out if you love quality mystery!",1373587200,5,579,4.519230769230769

5460070,5,B00ANGICPG,"If you love old time mysteries like Sherlock Holmes, you'll love this show!  I haven't been able to stop watching it.  The detective is cutting edge for the 1890's, using forensic tools that we would laugh at now but back then were unheard of.  The stories are very interesting, the characters are fun, and it shows you the beginning of women working in a ""man's job"".  I would strongly recommend this!",1371686400,2,402,4.619718309859155
