8502241,5,B006OT0U3S,If you watched this game (on TV or otherwise) you'll want to see it again on this DVD.  See Andrew Luck at his best in his last college game.,1365638400,,141,3.8620689655172415
8502242,5,B006OT0U3S,"I bought this for my boyfriend.  He loves it.  Of course, he loves anything that involves his alma mater Stanford!  The only downside is that Stanford lost this game in overtime.  C'est la vie.",1333324800,,193,4.588235294117647
8502243,5,B006OT0U3S,"It's pretty much just the game with no commercials, not a lot of filler from the pre-game or half-time shows.  They do include the quick half-time interview with the Stanford coach, the post-game interview with the OSU coach, and the trophy presentation  The package also includes a code to access additional material online.  I haven't done that yet, so I will have to update my review after I've seen what's there.

If you watched the game in hi-def on ESPN, then this won't look as good as the original.  This isn't blu-ray, so no high-def, just plain old NTSC.  This looked just fine on my old-style standard definition television, just as detailed as any other standard DVD I have.  No regrets at all about the purchase.",1333152000,,725,4.7063492063492065
8502244,1,B006OT0U3S,"Sadly, the company that produces these reproductions seems to be anchored in the analog world while the rest of us have plunged happily into the world of HD sports. I received this DVD and was deeply disappointed in the quality of the image on a HDTV. Why even use a DVD disk for this production - a VHS tape would have been more appropriate! I still have the recorded game on my DVR and compared the production of each. I'm now trying to figure out how I can get the DVR recording on a DVD...Don't buy from these people. It really is a rip-off.",1332720000,,545,4.25
