But it also occurs to me I don't even know how to praise them anymore. The Mission has been the soundtrack to my life for decades, for most of my life. How do I express why I've done that?",1438214400,,300,4.101694915254237
8188151,4,B000P1KPJK,"Any Mission fan will love this however, Butterfly is actually missing the first verse and chorus!  [seriously, the master was edited to fade from black into the middle of the video]  obviously someone at Universal seriously mucked this up.

Apart from that it's brilliant and the best copies [quality wise] of these videos I've ever seen.

Also, deliverance is edited to begin at the ""fast"" part [without the intro] but this is probably just the single version and not an obvious mistake like the butchered butterfly.

The Golden Nuggets are little factoids [any fan would already know] running during the videos and easily can be turned off.

Probably should just wait for the Sum & Substance DVD due out soon. :) UPDATE: The Sum & Substance video is better by having more videos, however, the overall picture quality is not nearly as clear - looks almost as if it were mastered from the VHS.",1217203200,2,893,4.766233766233766
