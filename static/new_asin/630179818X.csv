358122,4,630179818X,"""Little Murders"" is another of the obscure films I saw at base/post theaters during my military days. It was certainly better than average and many of the images (especially the wedding scene with Donald Sutherland) have stayed with me through the years.

While I found it less funny during a recent viewing than I remembered, the message was still disturbing and contemporary. It is certainly satire and black comedy, but you often lose yourself in the story. It is a very individual film, different people will laugh at different times and at different things. During a theater viewing it seemed to isolate audience members from each other.

Jules Feiffer's screenplay is about Alfred (Elliot Gould), a NYC photographer and self-described ""apathist"", sort of an unengaged existentialist. He is completely disillusioned and has deadened himself to the cries, smells, sights and pains of violent city living; in a Big Apple even more adversarial than that of ""The Out-Of-Towners"".

Alfred can't feel much anymore but he takes an interest in Patsy (Marcia Rodd), a controlling interior decorator optimist, who wants to change him. Patsy has been able to stay upbeat and involved despite daily encounters with muggers, snipers, obscene callers, and a family that leaves a lot to be desired.

The film seems to be saying that harsh urban life cuts its people off from gentler human emotion. As an interior decorator Patsy's life is largely defined by her ability to control her possessions and the attitudes of those around her.

Patsy's father, mother and younger brother are living a painful parody of ""family life,"" and Alfred's weirdness eventually allows him to fit right in. The dinner scene where he first meets her family is one of the funniest in film history.

The film illustrates that neither apathy nor constructive engagement are successful mechanisms for coping with the modern world. It seems to be saying that the only rational response to living in an insane environment is to vigorously participate in the insanity.

358123,5,630179818X,This old cult classic was seen by myself and a few friends more than 40 times at all the old neighborhood theaters back in the early to mid seventies. It was a great escape from what the world was then. We laughed at all the crazy stuff that happened in the film. I happened to think of this movie and decided to look it up.

358124,3,630179818X,"that left me singularly unengaged. So, the world is going to heck in a handbasket and the characters respond to their situation by howling in the storm, apart from the lead, who has given up. A very able cast each get their chance on stage (and it betrays its stage roots at every turn), and boy do they make the most of it. The female lead's archness was so irritating that it was a positive relief when - well, enough of that. She wasn't alone though: the saliva flowed and the carpet fibres flew freely throughout.
It's an odd film, in that it contains some very vivid scenes that stick in the mind, along with many very long, self-indulgently-delivered speeches that bog the story down and leave the viewer wanting it to be over.",1184284800,2,733,4.477611940298507

358126,5,630179818X,"I stumbled on ""Little Murders"" on HBO back in the 70's and loved the dark and intellectual humor. Recently, I bought a copy and snuck it into our family movie night rotation. Having not seen it in so many years, I was a little worried it might not live up to my recollection. However, it did not disappoint. Quite the contrary... it turned out to be one of the best movie viewing experiences I've had in years. I saw both my wife and daughter laughing, though to be fair.. I think they expected things delivered a little faster.

In my opinion, Little Murders is the gold standard of dark comedy. Generally, attempting to analyze why a particular piece of art ""works"" is a silly exercise, but some comments on the high points for me... First, the cast. Vincent Gardenia was one of the finest character actors ever to stand in front of a camera and this was, in my opinion, his magnum opus. Alan Arkin too holds a very special place in ""comedies for people who think"" and he delivers in Little Murders as well. The underlying vision of the film takes ""dark"" to never-seen-again levels, and gets there primarily under the power of five of the all-time most perfect rants/soliloquies in the history of film:

* Lou Jacobi as a judge speaking on the presence of The Deity in marriage vows gives a brilliant, extended, passionate rant on how difficult life was for his generation. The camera angles are *perfect*. The details are perfect. I would have paid just to watch this.

* Vincent Gardenia, who is to avant garde 70's comedy what Steve McQueen is to prison camp escape movies, delivers an exquisite, progressive, meltdown as he finally gets his arms around, and then recongizes his place in, the mega-apocalyptic nature of the NY he lives in... I wept. (Example: [police are taking a Stepford Wives looking woman out in a body bag as Vincent and his wife step past and around it, barely taking notice] -  Wife: ""I saw that nice detective again today.. he was here investigating another murder.""  Vincent: ""Who got it this time?""  Wife: ""I don't know.. some woman from the other wing""  Vincent: <relieved> ""Thank *GOD*."").

* Alan Arkin was the director and had a cameo as the detective.. His attempt to reassure the family after 347 unsolved murders in their neighborhood is spectacular.

* The marriage vows scene with the radical priest Donald Sutherland interacting with the rest of the cast is rich in exquisite detail.

* Finally, this introspective, quiet moment with lead character Elliot Gould in the dark.. unfolding very slowly..  when he recounts how he once monkey wrenched his FBI mail watcher in college.. It was slow and intellectual.. It didn't advance the plot of the movie.. but when you were done watching it, you were left sitting there reeling from the brilliance of the scene. It too was almost it's own short subject.

If you enjoy dark comedy, find some quiet time and watch this film. Give it time to build. It does start slowly if you compare it to modern films, but I promise you will enjoy it.",1167350400,4,3023,4.672316384180791

358203,5,630179818X,"Little Murders (1971)...I really had no idea what I was getting into with this film, as I had neglected to read any reviews.  Often I may buy a film, without any prior knowledge, if it looks interesting enough and if the price is right, which was both the case here (involvement by Arkin, Sutherland, and Gould peaked my interest).  It's not unusual that I might find disappointment in such a haphazard, grabasstic method of picking a movie, but this one looked promising, and it turned out to be much more than I ever would have thought.  Based on a play by syndicated cartoonist and social commentator Jules Feiffer (I Want to Go Home), the film was directed by Alan Arkin, who also appears in the film, stars Elliott Gould (M.A.S.H.) and Marcia Rodd (Handle with Care) in her feature film debut.  Also appearing is Vincent Gardenia, who many may remember as the effervescent and kooky Frank Lorenzo from TV's All in the Family, Elizabeth Wilson (Nine to Five), Lou Jacobi (Amazon Women on the Moon), Jon Korkes (The Day of the Dolphin), John Randolph (Serpico), Doris Roberts, who can most likely now be seen as the interminable pushy Marie Barone on the popular TV show ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", and Donald Sutherland (Kelly's Heroes).

The film begins with an unlikely relationship developed between Alfred Chamberlain (Gould) and Patsy Newquist (Rodd) in what can probably be characterized as a very normal circumstance (in New York, at least) of getting harassed on the streets for no real reason other reason than someone thinking you're asking for it by giving them what they perceive as a disrespectful look.  Anyway, Patsy, who's an optimistic sort, sees Alfred, who's a self-described apathetist, as sort of a project or cause, someone who needs to be shown that there are reasons to embrace life.  Their relationship progresses, more so due to Patsy than anything else, and this leads to Patsy taking Alfred to meet her family, and, eventually a nuptial performed in a very untraditional ceremony.  Patsy's still having difficulties in changing Alfred's outlook on life in general and tensions arise, a breakthrough does come, but at a very inopportune moment to which I won't comment on any more as not to spoil the effect.  Sounds fairly simple, doesn't it?  Well, my synopsis hardly begins to relate the absurdities that emanate at nearly ever turn of this movie, some obvious, others a bit more subversive, for lack of a better term.

I do love the darker comedies, and this one is about as dark as they come.  While watching the film, I couldn't help but notice perhaps the characters presented where meant to be representative of certain elements of society.  You have Alfred, the uncaring, apathetic individual who's content to live in a world to which he has no control, allowing the chips to fall where they may, succumbing to forces rather than trying to face them head on and deal with them.  Pasty represented to me those who would try to make things better, knowing that while there is plenty of unpleasantness in the world, each day brings forth new opportunities to make a change.  Patsy's father Carol (Gardenia) appears to be akin to those who would value institutions over progressive change, constantly seeing the world in comparative terms of how different (and better) things where to how they are now, forever critical of the current state of affairs, more often only seeing the superficialities rather than understanding the true nature of issues faced by a contemporary society.  And then there's Patsy's mother (Wilson), a woman that seems to understand little outside of her own world, content to live happily within one of her own making, one that isn't affected by forces she can't control.  Finally there's Patsy's brother Kenny, who's just strange, but possibly due to something within himself that others might find beyond their ability or desire to understand and accept.  Well, aside from all my pontificating, this is a really wonderful film for those who can deal with it...so often with a film of this type it finds difficulty in acceptance, as some people just don't relate the possibility that absurdity, taken to this level, can be funny.  There are any number of great sequences throughout the film, but the highlights to me where the ones featuring The Judge (Jacobi), The Reverend (Sutherland, who's cast perfectly here), and Lt. Practice (Arkin) as each came into the film, left their indelible mark, and left.  There's also an excellent scene involving Gould's character on the subway, to which I won't say any more, but given the reactions by his fellow riders to his `situation', it exemplifies what most of us would readily assume about life in The Big Apple.  Not only is the film filled with great performances, but also wonderful lines, a couple of my favorites being `Are you really so down on people or are you just being fashionable?, and `So many complications when you marry a man shorter than yourself.'  Given my descriptives of various characters, you may be able to tell who said what, but to get the full and total effect you really should see the film, that is if your sense of humor is broad enough to include what some might find offensive or not open minded enough to appreciate a thoughtful and enjoyable journey into the absurd.

The wide screen anamorphic (1.85:1) picture on this DVD is very clean and clear, but I do suspect a little bit of cropping as there was a very minor bit of the titling credits missing, but certainly nothing to get upset over.  The Dolby Digital stereo comes through very sharp.  Extras include a theatrical trailer, a couple of television spots, and a commentary track by Jules Feiffer and Elliot Gould.  As another reviewer has already mentioned (to which I was thankful), avoid looking at the titles to the chapter stops as not to give away some very important elements of the film.

358204,5,630179818X,"By all means get this movie--it's a keeper. LITTLE MURDERS seems to have gotten lost in the shuffle of auteurist favorites of the 1970's, but it has always been a favorite of mine. This and SMILE (which is much sweeter and gentler)are the two best American social satires of the era. LITTLE MURDERS treads the fine line between the surreal, the prophetic, and the familiar with (mostly) stunning fluidity. The cast is wonderful--I have always wondered if Donald Sutherland was spoofing hippie guru Alan Watts in his performance of the minister....

Two minor complaints:

1.)DO NOT READ THE CHAPTER TITLES IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM BEFORE! They give too much away in a movie that is otherwise unpredictable.

2.)No commentary from director Alan Arkin.

Great to have on DVD, though. This film has aged surprisingly well.",1093219200,3,824,4.949275362318841
358205,5,630179818X,"Top o' the heap, far as the black comedy thing goes.  First film directed by Alan Arkin; he also plays a neurotic paranoid detective who does more than stumble over his words; he sputters them out due to mental freneticism that is completely unavoidable, some form of psychosomatic willies going on there, for sure.  He's investigating the 345 homicides in the preceding six months (these days, that may not be so far from the truth, in New York City), and one of them has affected the family of our hero (see below).

Donald Sutherland is absolutely hilarious as a free form minister whose hedonism knows no bounds.  He takes pains to let the entire wedding party know of his tremendous pleasure at making them squirm in their seats, using the word masturbation (remember, this is a 1971 film!) a few times in his diatribe as he marries off our hero and heroine, Elliot Gould and his leading lady, Marcia Rudd.

Gould plays a photographer whose passive nature results in his getting beat up a lot by neighborhood youths who have nothing better to do, and Rudd, the girlfriend he meets when she saves him from yet another drubbing.  Of course, being passive and all, he does nothing at all to save her when she herself gets set upon by the same ruffians.  She cottons to him anyway and takes him to meet her parents, played by the always great Vincent Gardenia (here, he plays an uncannily foreshadowed version of the husband in Moonstruck) and Elizabeth Wilson.

Gardenia is definitely one of the stars here, with his ""So young fella, what's your pleasure?"" to Gould, over and over again.  He's a comic gem.  With a first name of Carroll (""I told you never to call me that""), his threatened masculinity is always on display (here is where the foreshadowed Moonstruck character thing comes in), and he's spot on, trying to prove how valuable he is to his family.

Also here is Lou Jacobi as a portentous, stertorous judge in probably his funniest role on film.  He has never been better than he is here.  His monologue is one of the true comic masterpieces in American cinema and MUST be seen.  The movie is worth seeing for Jacobi alone, but there is so much more here, it's a true classic.

Rodd is constantly ""attacked"" by phone calls from The Breather, and in one punchy little scene, describes to Gould her typical day in which one small thing after another goes wrong (the real meaning of the film's title).

The ending is a zinger and makes this film completely up to date, not at all obsolete.  A great piece of cinema for those who find joy in how pain can make us laugh.  Or how laughter accompanies pain.  Or how it HAS to accompany pain; otherwise, what fun would we have at all, at all...in this world?

Punchy, smart--written by the brilliant Jules Feiffer.  See it.",1091923200,27,2780,4.598377281947261
358206,4,630179818X,"Whose bright idea was it to reveal a major plot twist in the scene menu? They could have put 'The Shooting', or something. Not everyone has seen the film. In fact, very few have. I have, but didn't understand it. It's gratifying to discover that Elliot Gould didn't either, at the time. He's proud of the movie and his performance, and only occasionally strays into repitition (the crew) on the commentary. He takes things a bit too wee seriously.

Fieffer, I heard, had not liked the film and I was surprised to see he had done a commentary. It appears that he disliked Arkin's turn as the detective, thinking it was too broad and took you out of the movie. He has since changed his mind, but I think he was right the first time. Arkin over-acts the way only he can. But it's what the film needed at that point, a few laughs, or else it would have all been too heavy. Fieffer did not reveal too much to help me with my comprehension of the film, other than some suggestion of a collective American nervous breakdown after Kennedy's assassination.

Little Murders is prophetic about the fear of crime creating gated communities but has been proven wrong over the breakdown of belief in law enforcement. I don't live there, but apparently NYC has made inroads into cleaning up crime. The so-called 'zero tolerance' policy.",1091491200,2,1321,4.617021276595745
358207,5,630179818X,"If you look at reviews for this film, you will notice that they fall in two categories: people who praise it to the stars as one of the finest American comedies ever filmed, and people who had no clue what they were in for when they sat down to watch it. Well, as far as the second group goes, if you don't want to see a depressing movie, definitely don't watch this. But as hard as it may be to believe, considering that practically nobody has even heard of it, that first category of reviewers is NOT EXAGERATING: this REALLY IS one of the best comedies ever filmed. It is literally the blackest comedy I have ever seen, but I have loved it for more than twenty years now, ever since I found a copy of the then-out-of-print VHS. Thank heaven it's finally available on DVD, and with a full-length commentary track by actor/producer Gould and writer Feiffer, maybe, just maybe, this film will FINALLY get the serious attention it deserves. The performances of Vincent Gardenia and Elizabeth Wilson are among the finest comic acting ever done by anyone EVER. (And no, I'm not being overblown in saying that.) And the 3 major cameos (all of which are long, brilliant monologues) by Sutherland, Jacobi and Arkin are nothig short of show-stoppers. Nobody's heard of this movie because it's so uncommercial, but if there were any justice in the comedy world this movie would have at least six or seven reasons to be in the Hall of Fame, not least of which are Gould at his peak and Feiffer, one of our greatest social satirists. Even more depressing, and even more relevant, today than when it was first released (and that's not true of a lot of late-60s/early-70s-era stuff, which often dates fairly poorly) Little Murders belongs on the shelf of any serious fan of what comedy is meant to be. A STUNNER, A CLASSIC, AND A NEAR-MIRACULOUS ACCOMPLISMENT BY THE CAST AND FILMAKERS. ENOUGH GOOD THINGS CANNOT BE SAID ABOUT ""LITTLE MURDERS.""

Elliott Gould is fascinating as the world weary and world famous photographer who spends his afternoons taking pictures of Dog feces.

Lo and Behold, he continues to win awards for his work.  Deepening his sense of the meaningless of life.  That's the strange part.
The dangerous part lies mainly in the film's underlying current of social unrest. Stemming largely from the idea that life is meaningless and essentially without value.  Random beatings, random murders, all help our protagonist over the edge.  Yes this a comedy, but it is a dark comedy.

He is then brought into Patsy's insular family with their own brand of self-contained lunacy (as in all families)and absolutely hysterical sidetrips and surprises follow to a disturbing, yet hilarious, ending.
Not to be missed are the following:  Lou Jacobi as the pompous judge railing about the good old days from the bench.  Donald Sutherland as the hippy existential priest conducting the funniest wedding ever filmed. Gould's liberal parents, rearguard 30's leftists over-intellectualizing and full of theories while being totally inept at real life and unable to relate to their only child. Alan Arkin as Lt.

It displays a collapsed and paranoid urban environment in which people are combative with words and isolated by them.

I feel it should be essential viewing for any writer, as it contains four of the best-- if not the actual four best-- monologues I've ever heard in a movie. Arkin and Sutherland have amazing monologues that are only marginally upstaged by those given by Gould and Jacobi.

Originally starring Eliot Gould and Barbara Cook, the play opened on Broadway on 25 April 1967 and then closed four days and seven performances later on April 29, nothing short of an absolute debacle.  Surprisingly, the play was well received in a London staging, and a 1969 off-Broadway revival starring Eliot Gould and Linda Lavin proved critically and popularly successful, racking up four hundred performances and winning awards for both Feiffer and Lavin.  During his association with the play, Gould acquired the screen rights, coaxed Feiffer into adapting the play for the screen, and signed Alan Arkin to direct.  The resulting film, shot on a shoe-string budget, opened in 1971 to mix reviews and box office indifference.  Over the years, however, it has slowly gained a cult following, and today it is generally regarded a small masterpiece.

According to Feiffer, the play had its genesis in the assasination of JFK, the several political assasinations that followed, and the rising tide of street violence that beset the 1960s in general.  Although the play and the film differ in a number of ways, they retain the same general sense of America--as Feiffer puts it on the audio track--in the middle of a nervous breakdown.  Alfred (Gould) is a photographer whose career has gone from fine arts to commerical arts and now back to fine arts, fueled by series of photographs of excrement.  He is, however, an ""apathist"" (not to be confused with ""pacifist"") who declines to feel, fight back, or behave in any way that impacts society or the people around him--even when he is being mugged.  As fate would have it, he attracts Patsy Newquist (Marcia Rodd), a pushy and domineering young woman who looks upon his apathy as the opportunity to mold him into the perfect man.

Patsy's family is less enthusiastic, particularly when Alfred, an atheist, refuses to have a wedding ceremony that makes any reference to the diety.  The wedding turns into a riot, but even as Patsy begins to sink into the apathy that characterizes her new husband, he decides that he is the one who must change and become more like her.  At this point, however, the random violence of the city steps in and changes the game, sending not only Alfred but Patsy's entire family over the edge.  What with screaming judges (Lou Jacobi), nutty preachers (Donald Sutherland), police officers on the edge of a nervous break down (Alan Arkin), and a supporting cast that includes Vincent Gardinea, Elizabeth Wilson, and Doris Roberts, LITTLE MURDERS is truly one of the most memorably cast and performed films of its era.

It also has a tremendous flaw, for about two thirds of the way into the film the whole thing comes to a screeching halt--for the simple reason that we've come to like Patsy (Marcia Rodd) too much for the film's unexpected twist to be read as funny.  The movie does soon regain steam and it ends on a wickedly funny note, but it is easy to see why it failed at the box office.  Whatever the case, this is easily Eliot Gould's best screen performance, the rarely seen Marcia Rodd turns in an excellent performance as well, and the cast is a knockout from start to finish.  Feiffer's adaptation is not quite as sharp as his original play, but it comes damn close, and the audio bonus that shifts between Feiffer and Gould is well worth a listen.  Recommended.

Sometimes very funny, occasionally disturbing super-black comedy about
the absurdity of modern urban life.

On first viewing, while some of the performances were wonderful (Donald
Sutherland), some were merely OK (Elliott Gould in the lead) and some
are over the top and annoying (Lou Jacobi, and, surprisingly, the great
Alan Arkin - who also directed, perhaps taking on too much).

Too often the cast feel like actors are in different movies, with
different styles and levels of reality.

This is a very brave and odd film, with some unforgettable moments, but
a few that feel awkward and trite.

Most reviews were stronger than my reaction, and I could definitely
imagine this being one of those films where the strengths would seems
stronger, and the weaknesses less annoying on repeated viewings. Nice
cinematography by Gordon Willis.",1301875200,,895,5.1875

Its quirky, dark humor and avant-garde message could easily have made it a cult classic, but most people I know have never heard of it!  I'm happy to own my own copy, now, and to know it's a movie that stands up to time. It was more than worth the small investment!",1289433600,,363,4.112676056338028
