8201825,4,B000LMPLN8,"This has become one of my favorite videos.  Of course, it humanizes the illegal aliens.  They are human!  The  character development of the main character, Adam, who was part Mexcian, demonstrates how bigotry can exist even within a biracial individual.",1207094400,,253,5.25
8201826,1,B000LMPLN8,"Just another movie trying to persuade the average American Citizen to feel sorry for Illegal Aliens.

Do IA's often get raped, beaten and worked by the coyote's that smuggle them. Sure they do, but it is a fate they freely accept.

Just like our Great Nation's Airmen, Soldiers, Sailors and Marines, they freely accept the possible of death when signing their enlistment contract. These IA's know full well the possible consequences of their decision to hire a ""Coyote"".

Moreover, the movie consist of poor acting, bad picture quality and a lack of suspense when the Border Patrol Agent crosses into Mexico.",1203811200,,608,5.0
