8306900,1,B001GT9DSO,"Do NOT buy this dvd! Funimation utterly ruined this release. The video quailty is absolutely atrocious. In a lot of dark scenes there is noise and grain everywhere. Some reviews i read thought this was possibly intentional from a stylistic point of view. Well, its not. Ive compared them with the fansub versions and the fansub versions do not have this grain. Really, this show is almost unwatchable because of it. I cant belive this passed quality control. Avoid this release at all costs. I don't know if the individual dvd releases are in better shape than these box sets, but as it stands this is not worth anyones money

you can find pictures of how bad this looks on this thread over on the funimation forum, unless they remove it

8306901,3,B001GT9DSO,"It centers around four girls in New York whom basically wake up one morning only to find out that they died the night before, of which they have no memory. The four girls are from all walks of life. First of all there is Kate..honor roll type of girl. Then there is Claire..a girl that lives alone and pays her own bills and struggles to do,that sounds familiar, Rose is another type of girl who must take care of her little brother and sister. Last but not least is Rachel..the popular trendy type that is only concerned with herself and her circle of friends.
  They have no idea what they have become until they are all called together and meet a mysterious man & woman who begin to piece together the puzzle for them.
  There are two cursed clans and the clans hate one another yet each clan has a piece of what they need to lift their curse. There in is the battle..1 clan on the verge of dying out unless they can lift the curse. The other clan which Claire,Kate,Rose & Rachel belong to are trying to wipe their adversaries out in order to lift their own curse.
  When ever the four girls are called together they must kill and that creates a moral problem of its own. One day they are high school girls and the next they must kill to survive.
  There is action and some blood but for the most part of it the story is about how they cope with their daily problems of being teenage girls.
 Why did I give it 3 stars if the anime is so horrid..Well I enjoyed the story quite well. There are no stand alone episodes so it plays like one story. There are parts were the anime is well done but those parts are few and far between. Once you reach the OVA ""Dead Girls"" then suddenly the anime is far far better and continues the story well into the future.
  This is hard for me to recommend but I did enjoy collection 1 and Collection 2...that is after you get past animation.
 These are thin-pak collections in a wide screen format.",1239840000,2,1933,4.265753424657534
