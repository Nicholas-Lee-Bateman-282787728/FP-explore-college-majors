2762947,4,B000NA1WDQ,"I have ordered this product from Amazon.com which I consider a great buy. It has two movies, City of Angels & Michael on one dvd. The price is great and if you are a fan of John Travolta & Nicolas Cage these are two movies that are a little different for both actors.

The subject matter is Angels for both movies, and both actors made these movies before they started making action/drama movies with lots of violence. I guess it was a kinder & more gentle time.",1269561600,,462,4.310344827586207

2762949,4,B000NA1WDQ,"Since City of Angels and Michael are two of my favorite movies, I definitely wanted to own them. But, with limited storage space, I don't have a huge area to store my DVD collection. So, this double-feature disc fit the bill.

The only problem with these types of discs is that they have to be handled more carefully to avoid scratching either side of the disc.",1266451200,,361,4.46969696969697

The CD jacket says that there are special features with scene-specific commentary, making-of and visual effects commentaries, etc. The CD says that the special effects are on side B.

2763015,5,B000NA1WDQ,"City of Angeles is a deeply moving story of an angel, Nicolas Cage, who's curious about human emotions. He meets a caring lady doctor, Meg Ryan, whose struggling with her own emotions, when she loses a patient. The angel is drawn to her. She can see and talk to him, but she feels his lack of emotions. He tries to explain what he is, but she doesn't believe him. He meets a former Angel who chose to become a human for the love of a woman and helps the Angel on his journey to become human. The characters are believable and moving  I saw MICHAEL several years ago and I liked it. I didn't think Angels could be anything like this character, John Travolta portrayed. Sloppy, smoker, dirty mouth. Really? An Angel?  But inspite of it's flaws, this angel was as caring and as good, as one would want an angel to be.",1438905600,,814,4.313725490196078

2763018,5,B000NA1WDQ,"This double feature dvd set of City Of Angels and Michael are definitely films that help bring an exuberant movie. The City of Angels movie is on one side of the disc while Michael is on the second disc.  The City of Angels stars Nicholas Cage as an angel named Seth and he is shown helping a young female child cross over to the next world as her mother understandably grieves at what his happening (with the mother being unaware). Seth speaks with angel Cassiel (Andre Braugher) about his feelings and curiosity on what it may feel like to experience human life. The angel Cassiel listens with love and compassion for Seth, but is careful to avoid telling Seth what to do when he meets and falls very much in love with Meg Ryan (Maggie Rice). Seth begins to entertain the idea of trying to live as a human when he meets a man named Nathaniel Messinger (Dennis Franz) who explains why he is able to easily see Seth and other members of the heavenly realms. Messinger then also mentions about the people in his life that he wanted to mention this to but really cant such as his family members (played by Robin Bartlett and Joanna Merlin).Complicating matters to this equation is that Maggie Rice is also romantically with Jordan Ferris (Colm Feore). Dr. Rice also begins to question her role and place in the world after a patient that she tried to save died despite her best efforts to prolong his life.  The movie Michael stars John Travolta as Archangel Michael who is sent to help certain people fulfill part of their destinies. Tabloid emmployees Frank Quinlan (William Hurt), Huey Driscoll (Robert Pastorelli), and Dorothy Winters (Andie MacDowell) are joined together through a job assignment to Iowa that is spearheaded by their boss Vartan Malt (the late Bob Hoskins). They arrive to Iowa and are greeted by a woman named Pansy Milbank (the late Jean Stapleton) who is actually harboring Archangel Micheal (John Travolta) as she said that she is/ However, at the least, Dorothy Wiinters is one of the first to initially express skepticism despite his wings because Michael expresses affinities for things that appear to not be attributed to celestial beings on an earth vacation such as smoking, the way he talks etc. Apparently, Michael has the gift of also getting them out of trouble after a bar fight. This is due to a scene where he and his new entourage are summoned to court after the brawl and their fate is decided by Judge Esther Newburg (Terri Garr). The scene illustrates how Michael is able to use his charms. However, there is a scene where he tells Dorothy Winters that she is not charmed by him because he put a spiritual  block on her that prevents it from happening. There is so much more to both of these delightful movies, yet I prefer to now go into some of the extras listed to both of these dvds; 2 commentaries of the City of Angels movie, one from the director and the other from the screenwriters, scene specific commentaries by the cinematographer and production designer, making of and visual effects documentaries, additional scenes, interviews with Alannis Morrisette and Peter Gabriel, music videos by the GooGoo Dolls and U2, Music Only Track with Gabriel Yared commentary, theatrical trailer gallery. For the Micheal dvd are these listed bonuses; full-screen version, production notes, and the Michael movie trailier. Some of the things that I enjoyed about the bonuses from this double feature of City of Angels (Side A) and Michael Side B; A feature of other movies that contain references to heaven and angels such as Wings of Desire, Faraway So Close, Angels In The Outfield (1954), 1994 version of Angels In The Outfield, A Guy named Joe (1944), Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941). Heaven Can Wait (the 1978 version is mentioned in the bonus but there is also an earlier version of Heaven Can Wait from 1943. Here Comes Jordan (1944) and Steven Spielbergs Always (1989)movie are also mentioned in the bonuses. Of course, there are also more angel/heaven movie references featured in the bonuses. The bonuses also include some information on the actors and actresses attributed to both movies. There is also some career details on the screenwriters. For instance, Delia Ephron and her sister Nora Ephron worked closely together for the Michael movie (credits include Nora Ephron as an associate for the Sleepless In Seattle movie and a written novel called Hanging Up in 1996, which was listed to have gotten rave reviews. The song Spirit In The Sky by Norman Greenbaum was featured in the movie trailer extra for the double feature set of Michael and City of Angels (of course there are more details included in the bonus that could take up the span of another review).",1438214400,4,4710,4.7908979089790895

2763083,2,B000NA1WDQ,"Had this been fully acknowledged in the advertising I would just have purchased City of Angels by itself.  As our blu ray player controls the formatting, it took awhile to figure out how to change the formatting to full screen, as we haven't had to do that in the 2 years we've owned the blu ray. If you can't do that, everyone will be very stretched to fit the screen. Our Elite wouldn't change the format correctly.

Along with that, the quality was poor, even for City of Angels. I've purchased DVDs rather than blu rays several times, which all look great on the screen. These did not. These are like movies that have been run through a Sony DVD copier--homemade.

I still gave this 2 stars because I really like the movies.",1405555200,3,728,4.458646616541353

2763119,1,B000NA1WDQ,"I bought this for the movie Michael.  The description said it was wide screen.  When i got it, only City of Angels is widescreen.  I could have saved some money buy buying Michael alone, but i ordered this cause i thoght it was widescreen.  Aparently, Michael is not available in wide screen.",1355875200,5,292,4.5576923076923075
2763120,5,B000NA1WDQ,"Two extremely fine films, Cage and Ryan extremely good in Angels, Travolta great in Michael. Twin successes for minimum investment",1355616000,,130,5.55
2763121,5,B000NA1WDQ,"Michael is a great movie and I love John Travolta in this role!  He is lovable, a different sort of character for him which is another reason I loved this movie... I love that he is not the typical angel role in this movie!

City of Angels, Oh My Gosh!  I was so touched by this movie...I love, love, love this movie!  A friend recommended I watch it and it has had the strongest impact in my life... it is wonderful!  Get your tissues!  And I will send you a hug before you watch it... it is phenomenal!  One of the five most touching, heart warming movies I have ever had the pleasure to watch.",1355529600,4,596,4.130434782608695
2763122,3,B000NA1WDQ,"I bought this because I mostly wanted City of Angels in widescreen, and this was actually cheaper than buying the DVD with only City of Angels.

First of all you would expect both movies to be in widescreen format from the description on the Amazon product page, but only City of Angels is.

Second, there is this big textual description on the back of the DVD about all the amazing extras about City of Angels. However, when you try to watch them, it says they are on the B side of the DVD. The only thing on the B side of the DVD is Michael. I suspect they took the A side from the regular wide screen edition of City of Angels, and instead of that B side just threw on Michael.

I like both movies, and for both movies the price is pretty good. But it doesn't excuse the incorrect marketing. It only misleads the buyer.",1332720000,21,822,4.222929936305732

No big deal.  But I still want Michael in wide so I wasted my money.  Yes I'm a fan of City of Angels and yes, it's in widescreen, but I would not have purchased this DVD had I known Michael was full screen.",1316217600,10,377,4.314285714285714

John Travolta is brilliant in this movie and I watched it over and over again and you always see new things that you never saw before.  John plays Archangel Michael so well and whoever wrote this movie had good insight. This is a movie that holds your attention all the way through.  It deals with the way people normally behave in this world and shows a different way of being.",1302048000,,535,4.115384615384615

I'm very upset over this and will never buy from this seller again!

Thanks for one movie when I should have received two!
