1192865,5,B000006DAL,"First off, I love the story. Although I only recently read the novel, it story of D'Artagnan, Richelieu, Louis XIII, et al has been one of the most fascinating and thrilling stories I've ever experienced. While some of the older film adaptations were pretty good, and the 1993 version with Charlie Sheen and Oliver Platt among the cast was midly amusing.
However, the Richard Lester films by far are the most faithful adaptations, and they're most comical.
The humor is derived not so much from one-liners and witty dialogue such as that delivered by Platt in the later adaptation, although they do help. It is more of genuine clumsiness, mainly on the parts of Raquel Welch as Constance and Frank Finlay as Porthos and even Michael York as D'Artagnan. ""Leave to Porthos to invent new ways to disarm himself"" is one of the great movie lines of all-time, as it follows a sequence where the eccentric musketeer, in showing off a ""new trick"" in throwing his sword into an dummy fails to take into account the possibility that an armed enemy might deflect the strike, which Aramis (Richard Chamberlain) does with ease. The action is splendid, and the swordplay is the best of any movie of the genre. Finally, the characters are as realistic as they get. The musketeers, for example, are often clean and well taken care of. But in these films, as in Dumas' novel, they were one step ahead of the soup line - often gambling what little money they had to get a meal. One of the most amusing sequences comes when Aramis and Porthos stage a fight at a cafe, during which the four companions - along with D'Artagnan's servant, Planchet (Richard Kinnear), steal enough food and drink to get them through the night. The sets are fabalous, the costumes outstanding and even the background details seem authentic.
Don't settle for one, as The Four Musketeers isn't so much a sequel as it is a conclusion to Dumas' novel.",1015200000,,1906,4.709580838323354

1192867,5,B000006DAL,"One scene in particular exemplifies why I like these movies.  In ""The Four Musketeers,"" troops are bombarding La Rochelle with cannon fire.  We see a long line of cannons, each going off in sequence.  In the foreground, we have a priest quietly blessing the cannons (in Latin, I think), and then between the cannons and the fortress, a herd of goats runs frantically along the line of the troops.
There's always at least three things going on in any given scene, and many times unusual things.  Many times, these elements represent (seemingly) contradicting ideas (war/peace/animal herding), and so there's a touch of surrealism to many of the scenes -- it takes a moment to sort out how you feel about what you are seeing.  This lends itself to multiple viewings.
Another note:  this regards this advertised twin pack of The Three Musketeers/The Four Musketeers.  I discovered that the credits in The Four Musketeers are in another language ... French, I believe.  It also seems to me that perhaps the soundtrack is not quite synchronized with the rest of the film in some places (but that may be just my imagination)...
But soundtrack anomalies don't bother to me with this film, as the visuals are the important thing with these films, and that is not spoiled at all.  This was an odd thing, though, and I'd previously wondered why they were selling this twin pack at such a reduced cost ... there's your answer.
Both films are still very enjoyable anyway, and I recommend not only getting the films but watching them many times, as you will see something new in them almost every time!",997833600,5,1589,4.7700729927007295
1192868,4,B000006DAL,"The Three and Four Musketeers I recommend to anyone who loves swashbucklers and the writings of Alexandre Dumas. These films remain pretty faithful to the original novel. Michael York does an excellent job as D'Artagnan. The musketeers excellently played by Oliver Reed(not as attractive as Athos in the book),Frank Finlay (not as tall or large as Porthos in the book or other screen versions),Richard Chamberlain (perfectly cast as Aramis).Raquel Welch did a great comedic turn as Constance but did not fit the characterization in the book. Faye Dunaway perfect in her acting ability as Milady de Winter. Christopher Lee and Charlton Heston great in their rolls as Count de Rochefort and Cardinal Richelieu. Simon Ward,Geraldine Chaplin,Jean Pierre-Cassel,Roy Kinnear and Spike Milligan also very good as the Duke of Buckingham,Queen Anne,King Louis,D'Artagnan's servant Planchet and Constance's cuckold of a husband Monsieur Bonancieux. The costumes,acting and scenery excellent for this period swashbuckler. I highly recommend it. Be sure to watch both parts to get the full story. Part 1 deals with D'Artagnan and the musketeers saving the Queen's honor from the machinations of Cardinal Richelieu and his agents ""The bad and beautiful Milady de Winter and her lover Rochefort two birds of prey in fine feathers"".Part 2 known as the Four Musketeers deals with the Cardinal and agents going for revenge against D'Artagnan and the Musketeers and viceversa. To fans of this version Ursula Andress was also considered for the part of Milady de Winter (an excellent choice,good actress and a real blonde beauty) and Charlton Heston was first wanted for the part of Athos but demanded the part of Cardinal Richelieu and got it. For those who love this version also be sure to see the sequel The Return of the Musketeers:The Musketeers 20 Years After. It has the same cast as the Three and Four Musketeers filmed 14 years later and also might add it has some new character additions. It's ashame that Oliver Reed and Roy Kinnear are gone. There could have been a fourth film about the Musketeers final days. If you want full film treatments of this novel I recommend The Three Musketeers-Gene Kelly version,The two part French version of 1961-62(quite similar to this one)the 1999 145 minute made for video stageplay and the Douglas Fairbanks 1921 version and its sequel the Iron Mask which not only deals with the Man in the Iron Mask Story but with the second half of the Three Musketeers novel (Fairbanks versions were Richard Lester's (Director of the Three,Four and Return of the Musketeers)favorites.

1192870,5,B000006DAL,"This is the best movie presentation of the Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas novel made thus far.  Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlain, Charleton Heston, Michael York, and the attractive Faye Dunaway and Racquel Welch are just a few in this all star cast.  The movie follows the novel quite well and the locations in France are spectacular.  Most of all the dry wit and humor in these movies are hillarious and make them a gem to watch over and over again.
Charleton Heston plays the evil Cardinal Richelieu, who barely puts up with the stupidity around him and is quite ambitious in power.  Oliver Reed, Spike Milligan, Richard Chamberlain are Athos, Porthos and Aramis and Michael York is the eager to do well D'artagnon.  Each of these actors are brilliant and very believeable to watch.
In my opinion these are the movies that Dumas would enjoy, full of adventure, wit, comedy and some tradgedy that will keep you watching these over and over again.",972604800,5,952,4.815950920245399
1192871,4,B000006DAL,"THE THREE and FOUR MUSKETEERS prove there was a time when big-budget spectaculars did not have to be stupid to be successful. The films are exceptional in many ways: George Macdonald Fraser's tightly condensed script actually improves on Dumas's prolix novel; the remarkable cast is made even more remarkable by the fact that not once does an oversized star presence dominate a scene; the direction and editing are both sharply controlled and imaginative; even the Achilles heel of Hollywood, the music, though written by two composers, is tastefully discreet.
This superior execution makes the films smashing entertainment. What makes them distinctive is their rich sense of the past. This is more than just a welter of period details (some of which, in fact, are anachronistic). It is a matter of interweaving the evocative backgrounds with the story until they are inseparable. The filmmakers' vision of the 17th century is certainly beautiful when we would expect it, such as the scenes at court, a constantly moving, dizzying texture of silks, satins, brocades, damasks, pearls, diamonds, crystal, gold and marble. More importantly, the details are striking when we would *not* expect them to be, in scenes of ordinary life. A woman has her teeth pulled in public, a man sits innocently under a window when a bucket of slop is emptied on his head, sewage runs open in the street, beggars are everywhere and no one ever has clean fingernails. Even the rich and powerful are barely one step above the pervasive filth.
These details, embedded in the very fabric of events, never slow things down or darken the film's light mood, they are just there, silently, slowly adding up to a persuasive recreation of the past. For example, in one conversation with d'Artagnan, Athos puts his hand to his mouth as he thinks, revealing the frayed, grimy cuff of his shirt. It looks as if it hasn't been washed in weeks. As a detail, it's nothing, but it speaks volumes about both Athos's lack of concern for his appearance and the tolerance for such slovenliness in an era when everything had to be washed by hand. (An activity we also see, incidentally.)
Other filmmakers, particularly Pasolini, provided precedents for such raw period environments. The difference lies in the way Lester and company balance these details against the forward push of the story. (Pasolini tends to wallow in them.) This was the first of several period films directed by Richard Lester in the 1970s. All of them share the same fast pace, slapstick action, cynicism about heroics, lush design and radiant cinematography. Few have made it to video. Let's hope that changes.",970790400,10,2643,5.009090909090909
1192872,5,B000006DAL,"Everybody says it, and it's absolutely true.  These two films are about as perfect as action/adventure filmmaking gets, with liberal doses of humor  rounding out the swashbuckling.  The cast is superb and the screenplay by  George Macdonald Fraser is a brilliant adaptation of the Dumas novel, full  of period color and comedy.  Richard Lester adds madcap visual gags and  clever asides and directs the action sequences with tremendous style and  flair.  Fencers will tell you that these are the best swordfights ever  filmed.  Rejoice that these are available again on tape and DVD, and don't  waste your time with the limp and phony Disney remake.  You'll find  something new to laugh or marvel at with every viewing.

These are the very best of swashbuckling movies, with great actors  and a fantastic scenery. Christopher Lee is fantastic as Rochefort and  Michael York is a great D'Artagnan. Actually it is hard not to fill this  review with praise for all the actors, because this is one of the rare  movies where no actor was miscast!
The best part is that all the  characters seems real, not the ordinary action heroes, they fumble, they  drop their weapons, everything done with good humour.

What I was left with was a bloated boring exercise in tedium.  Certainly these are handsome productions but all for naught.  Narratively these films are disjointed and confusing.  A lot of talent in front of the camera but few of the participants make any mark.  Oliver Reed and Faye Dunaway have their moments.  Then the moment passes.  This is situation where two films were made from material that probably could have been cobbled into a single coherent one.

Here we have a Double bill featuring two popular comedy films directed by Richard Lester. In THE THREE MUSKETEERS' [1973] it is set in the 17th Century Paris, when a young nave DArtagnan leaves home to seek his fortune as a swordsman. He soon makes friends with the three musketeers: world-weary Athos, comically arrogant Porthos and chivalric Aramis. Their enemy is aristocratic schemer Cardinal Richelieu, who plots to prove the infidelity of the Queen to King Louis XIII to increase his power.

In ' THE FOUR MUSKETEERS' [1974] with DArtagnan officially enrolled in the kings service, his army besieges the rebels at La Rochelle and Cardinal Richelieu is determined to prevent any meddling by the English before the city falls. He dispatches Milady de Winter to London with orders to assassinate Buckingham. But she has a price  carte blanche to dispose DArtagnan and the slut Bonacieux as she sees fit. Our heroes, in-between dodging musket balls at La Rochelle, must once again outwit the Cardinal Richelieus henchmen to save the day.

From Director Richard Lester and featuring a stellar cast Oliver Reed, Raquel Welch and Christopher Lee 'The Three Musketeers' and 'The Four Musketeers' are faithful adaptions of Alexandre Dumas' classic novel, with belly laughs a-plenty and endless swashbuckling.

FILM FACT No. 3: According to George MacDonald Fraser, Richard Lester became involved with the project when the producers briefly considered casting The Beatles as the Musketeers, as Richard Lester had directed two films with the group. The Beatles idea fell by the wayside but Richard Lester stayed. In late 1972 he hired George MacDonald Fraser to write the scripts, saying he wanted to make a four-hour film and cast Richard Chamberlain as Aramis. It was later decided to turn the script into two films. The Three Musketeers was shot by David Watkins, with an eye for period detail. The fight scenes were choreographed by master swordsman William Hobbs. On 19th September 1988, Roy Kinnear fell from a horse during the making of 'The Four Musketeers' in Toledo, Spain, and sustained a broken pelvis and internal bleeding. Roy Kinnear was taken to hospital in Madrid but died the next day from a heart attack, brought on by his injuries. Roy Kinnear was 54 years old. Roy Kinnear is buried in East Sheen Cemetery, which is also known as Sheen, and is a suburb of London in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Every generation has its own screen adaptation of The Three Musketeers. In 1921 there was Douglas Fairbanks as D'Artagnan. In 1939 the Alexandre Dumas novel became a musical comedy starring Don Ameche and the Ritz Brothers. An all-star cast including Gene Kelly, Lana Turner, June Allyson and Van Heflin brought the tale to life in 1948. And most recently, in 1993, the brat pack made their own ghastly atrocious Musketeer film with Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland and Chris O'Donnell. So what does the 1973 version of THE THREE MUSKETEERS have to recommend all you sword fighting swashbucklers out there?

After many versions of the Alexander Dumas classic adventure, along comes THE THREE MUSKETEERS and I was when I viewed the film for the first time extremely impressed by this particular adaption that has been divided the story over two films. The cast, comedy, adventure and quirky humour are somehow never at odds with the original story, using spectacular locations, lush cinematography, and historical accuracy. Alexandre Dumas pre (novel) wove fact and fiction together around historical events and characters.

Richard Lester also exploited some beautiful European locations for THE THREE MUSKETEERS. More than fifty locations and one hundred sets were spread across Spain. The crew made use of small towns, like Salamanca, where the local magistrate said he collected enough fees off the film's production to feed even the poorest person in the town for a year. And they had access to several castles, such as the beautiful Arnjuez Palace, often called the Versailles of Spain. But despite the gorgeous scenery, the spring and summer weather in Spain was gruelling because of the intense heat. On one day of shooting at Arnjuez, especially the scene where D'Artagnan is inducted into the Musketeers, the temperature reached 122 degrees Fahrenheit. A reported 7000 bottles of water were said to be consumed by the large cast and crew necessary for the elaborate scene. The sets for THE THREE MUSKETEERS were also closed and the European press didn't like it one bit. But Richard Lester was concerned about having his ideas stolen as four other adaptations of the Alexander Dumas classic were also in production at the time that consisted of two Italian, one French and one animated film.

While the photography is not as dark and candlelit realism as other previous films of this type of calibre, despite this, the lighting still evokes the period of time long before electricity became available, but with the slightly more romantic look of a Dutch master painting. Together with the astonishing costumes and palaces on display, this these two films definitely deserves getting this new digitally restored Blu-ray release. The two films were popular hits and was perfect at the time for the British summer of 1974 and 1975, and beyond.

Both films raised the benchmark for realism by adding blood and exhaustion to the swordfights. Some are played for laughs, but you always knowing that the swords and sabres are deadly weapons and that the bloody wounds really hurt. Here, all the history is kept quirky because of the well-researched screenplay by George MacDonald Fraser, author of the still-cherished Flashman books and they too inspired a lavish location-rich film calibre starring Alan Bates and Malcolm McDowell, in the film Royal Flash [1975]. George MacDonald Fraser also wrote a cutting book rounding up Hollywood's greatest historical inaccuracies.

The cast of actors in these two Musketeer films is an impressive mixture of European, British and American stars, and all are totally convincingly cast. Watching it now on this double Blu-ray disc release and especially in an 1080p digitally encoded image for the first time, it was very apparent that the entire dialogue track had been re-recorded afterwards and especially being looped. Even at the time, we could tell that some of the extras had had humorous dialogue added in later, such as the sedan chair carriers complaining about Faye Dunaway, and saying, ""She's put on weight..."" and passers-by commenting on Raquel Welch running around the streets in her nightgown at night, and saying, ""Put some clothes on, you saucy bitch!"" Also Jean-Pierre Cassel [Vincent Cassel's dad] as the confused French King appears to be performing in English but sounds more like the British actor Richard Briers.

Producers, Alexander Salkind and Michael Salkind brothers, made news by filming THE THREE MUSKETEERS and THE  FOUR MUSKETEERS back-to-back, with the cast under the impression it was going to be one long epic film. So despite the story being released as two films, all the actors only received one fee. Christopher Lee points out in his Christopher Lee: The Authorised Screen History that the small print mentioned they were being paid for a project, not a film. The producers tried the same manoeuvre five years later with the first two big-budget Superman films, but this time less successfully and especially having director Richard Lester having to complete Superman II after the production lost actor Gene Hackman and a stand-in is used in many scenes, and director Richard Donner who eventually released his own more serious version.

Filming THE THREE MUSKETEERS and THE  FOUR MUSKETEERS films were apparently an easier coup, but listening carefully it sounds to me like the American cast didn't return to loop their characters' voices. Charlton Heston, Faye Dunaway, Raquel Welch and Geraldine Chaplin do not sound like themselves in the film THE FOUR MUSKETEERS. While THE THREE MUSKETEERS is an outright and very funny adventure with almost non-stop action, THE FOUR MUSKETEERS has far more dramatic weight. No less brilliant, the many downbeat moments are worthy of any major historical drama of the time. While there's just as much action, initially I was slightly disappointed that it wasn't as funny, but it is still a joy to watch. But the shocks and dramatic turns still left a totally lasting impression. For both films to show such range, makes them definitely all-round entertainment for all ages, without compromising on the source material or characterisations.

Each swordfight has a unique twist to keep them fresh, without being unbelievable. For example, set in a royal laundry, amongst a firework display, a convent, or even on ice, fight arranger William Hobbs sword fight choreograph is all totally impressively imaginative and later worked on Ridley Scott's The Duellists, Flash Gordon, John Boorman's Excalibur and Terry Gilliam's Brazil among many others. William Hobbs appears in the film and, like all the main cast, does his own sword fighting. Christopher Lee and Oliver Reed had previously crossed swords in previous Hammer Films. Despite good safe sword fighting practice in the Musketeer films, that didn't protect them both from suffering injuries, Oliver Reed for example even impaling his wrist on a blade.

In both Musketeer films, they are definitely my favourite band of Musketeer actors. Michael York is well cast as an over-enthusiastic, floundering upstart. Frank Finlay is excellent comedy relief, both physically and verbally, and rarely so well used despite the relatively small part. Richard Chamberlain is distinctive as an effete ladies' man. But Oliver Reed gets to deliver his most sterling performance ever, somehow keeping his scenes deadly serious through most of the shenanigans, especially the heart-breaking showdowns in THE FOUR MUSKETEERS. It is also rewarding to see Charlton Heston back in period costume, effortlessly menacing as a behind-the-scenes villain, though still a fleshed-out character, Cardinal Richelieu. Note how aged he appears to be, knowing that this is in-between his 'action man' roles of The Omega Man and Earthquake. Also seeing Charlton Heston in his brief sparring with Christopher Lee is very electric in his performance. An important role for Christopher Lee, as he tried hard to escape his Dracula typecasting, demonstrating that Christopher Lee can act with the best of them, swordfight like a  professional, and effortlessly playing a very droll, romantic baddie with Faye Dunaway as his lover.

Faye Dunaway is at the top of her game, underplaying the villainess Milady. While Cardinal Richelieu is the mastermind, the head of church trying to depose the King, Christopher Lee and Faye Dunaway's characters do the Cardinal Richelieu's very dirty work. Faye Dunaway's touching performance rounds off her character so much that it makes it hard to fully condemn her villainess performance.

Raquel Welch plays the pivotal role of Constance the Queen's dressmaker as an accident-prone simpleton so well, that I initially thought Raquel Welch was indeed not all there. After seeing more of her films, I learned she was not just voluptuous but an excellent comedy actress. In Britain Raquel Welch was seen as the sexiest of  Hollywood female stars at that time period and as luck would have it, Hollywood were keen to make films in the United Kingdom at the time, meaning Raquel Welch appeared in many British comedies at the time, spoofing her image of a sex goddess. Hence Raquel Welch played Lillian Lust in the film Bedazzled offering two lumps with a cup of tea to Dudley Moore, and whipping half-naked slave girls in The Magic Christian.

Roy Kinnear almost steals his scenes in THE THREE MUSKETEERS as the hapless, maltreated sidekick Planchet, the workhorse of the many musketeers, often getting the last laugh in the comedy scenes. One of the biggest laughs in the first film is his character failing to steer his galloping horse around a tree. Although the gag is done by a stuntman, it is now no longer funny knowing that Roy Kinnear would have the serious and fatal accident and of course eventually passed away following a horse stunt during the filming of latter day sequel The Return of the Musketeers [1989], which reunited many of the cast and crew from these two films, and again directed by Richard Lester.

Richard Lester re-used many more British comedy actors from his time with The Goons BBC Radio comedy broadcasts and from The Beatles' films A Hard Day's Night and Help!, like Graham Stark and Bob Todd. But best of all, The Goons writer Spike Milligan shares scenes with Charlton Heston and in bed with Raquel Welch, who plays his wife! That's funny in itself, but Spike Milligan builds up his scenes, as well as showing great flair for more serious acting. While the first film maybe tries a little too hard to milk amusement out of every last onscreen character, there's little else to fault in these two wonderful gems.

So all in all, THE THREE MUSKETEERS and THE FOUR MUSKETEERS are both rousing adventurous yarns brought to vivid life on the screen by the brilliant director Richard Lester. They are the true old fashioned Hollywood type entertainment that is timeless in their appeal. Rarely have any films so combined action with humour; and together, the two films make for the perfect Saturday matinee double-feature. The rest of the cast are all equally impressive, from Christopher Lee in the scene stealing role of Rochefort to Faye Dunaways scheming temptress Milady. Once again, a special mention for the costume design, which is truly magnificent throughout. So all in all both films are non-stop fun and because Richard Lester shot two pictures in one go, you get two films for the price of one. Much of the two films are played for the physical and the verbal comedy, as well as you feel everyone had a brilliant time filming both films and it is such a shame we do not get to see documentaries of behind-the scene filming or personal interviews, but despite this, both films are just so brilliant to watch and you will never get bored, as each film has its own merit and some people prefer one to the other, but to me personally I love both films, but I have to admit the first film has a slight edge over the second film, and because so much action is going on both films are well worth viewing several times.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Optimum Releasing and StudioCanal brings you this Blu-ray double disc package with a 1080p encoded quality image and an equally impressive 1.78:1 aspect ratio and is not too bad given both film were release in 1973 and 1974, although the images can be slightly grainy at times and there is some dirt on the print. The picture doesn`t have a great deal of detail, particularly on long outdoor shots, and in some cases there is a slight halo effect on distant buildings. As far as the visuals go, the film is quite well made, with large sets and good use of location and everything on offer looks reasonably authentic for the time period settings. The relatively good news is that partial corrections to cover these limitations and make the film look sharper and smoother have not been applied. There are traces of filtering throughout the entire film, but they are clearly not as damaging as they could have been. The most sever examples are during the majority of the panoramic daylight scenes where detail and contrast have clearly been affected. Many of the close-ups, however, are quite easy to view and the colour reproduction is also very decent. Overall, however, the colour scheme is certainly so much more satisfying and much more superior than it was on the release of the inferior Anchor Bay DVD release.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Optimum Releasing and StudioCanal brings  you this Blu-ray double disc package with a 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Mono sound experience, and therefore doesn`t offer much in the way of audio aural excitement, although the dialogue is always clear and understandable. The English DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 track on both Blu-ray discs are quite good and with some of the more elaborate action scenes in the film have clearly benefited with the audio boasts that familiar crispness and fluidity all good audio tracks deliver. Similarly, the sound effects and music on both Blu-ray discs are very exciting, especially composed by the brilliant genius of Michel Legrand and Lalo Schifrin, they are well produced and don`t detract from the film.

Finally, with this Optimum Releasing and StudioCanal Blu-ray double disc release package, which can also be purchased as two separate Blu-ray discs if you prefer. Despite having no extra special features, but I am very happy to report that these Blu-ray double disc release package is such a great presentation. Sadly many of the cast are not around these days, but Richard Lester is, and it would have been a great opportunity to get some recollections on the making of such two epic swash buckling film epics, and with these oddball pair of films we could of at least had some kind of audio commentary if not a full documentary. Alas, it seems that these films are never to receive the respect of being remastered which they deserve this totally unique, eccentric and brilliant energetic missing link between the great Hollywood epics of the 1950s and 1960s and the huge Hollywood blockbusters we have had since. The lush soundtracks that were composed by Michel Legrand and Lalo Schifrin are respectively both available on a brilliant Compact Disc release, so all in all a definite must purchase, especially if you are a fan of both films, like me, and well worth adding to your Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

1192933,5,B000006DAL,"This is not a review of the two films as I love them. The problem I have with this set is the way the Blu - Ray menu works. The viewer Is presented with a list of languages for the first screen with no label as to what the lists represents. It turns out to be sub-title options but I couldn't get any of them to highlight what choice I was making and ended up with Japanese ! Grrrr ! I tried to access the main menu but was given a ""Unavailable""  message. So I let the film start hoping it would at least be in English. It was, but with Japanese Sub-titles. Fortunately I have a ""Tools"" button on my Blu-  Ray player and was able to turn them off. The quality of the transfers seems to be excellent so I'm happy there but  I found the menu system to be very confusing at first. To be fair this is the first ""All - Region"" DVD I have ever bought so maybe this is common and would make sense as selecting Sub-Titles (and menu Language) would be a logical first step for Non-English persons. That said, why doesn't the first page highlight your choice ? I was 3 feet from the TV and I couldn't see any change as I selected up and down arrows. The second time I tried it I ended up with German.

Now that I know how to make the disks play as I wish I'm going to sit back any enjoy two movies that I haven't see since they were in theaters.

1192943,5,B000006DAL,"In my opinion best version of the 3 Musketeers story. Sword fighting is down dirty and realistic, and lacks a lot of the typical Hollywood flash. How do I know this, because I've been in historical reenactment for over 20 years and much of that time has been spent studying the rapier both for stage and actual combat use. As for the setting and costume this is an exceptional production capturing the wide separation between peasant and noble casting the musketeers someplace in the middle. As noble solders, they are left largely to their own devices as how to maintain the appearance of their station.",1461196800,2,604,4.761904761904762
1192944,5,B000006DAL,"I'm not sure, but I think these were the first non-Disney films meant for older people that I had ever seen.  The art direction and direction for these two movies is superb.  And Lester's own direction for understated comedy really shines in these two films.

The humor that might have been played up had an American director helmed this thing, is kept subtle and pointed.  The grittiness of late Renaissance Paris is shown to be a mix of bland colors and uppercrust decorum living with and next to common street filth that pervaded 15th century Europe.

Charlton Heston, though physically perhaps miscast, does an excellent job acting the role of the French Cardinal.  His ""living blade"" is expertly portrayed by veteran actor Christopher Lee.  In fact this is indeed an all star cast.  From Geraldine Chaplain to Michael York to Frank Finlay to Oliver Reed and the ever memorable Raquel Welch (yes, she did more than just that dinosaur film), this film is filled with talented actors who give excellent performances from frame one all the way to the end credits.

The fencing isn't the clean clash of blades that so often were shown in older classic Hollywood films, but outright brawls as they often were, where the blade only served as one of many weapons in the combatants bodily arsenal.

An excellent film showing us a story of infidelity and gallantry all rolled into one.  And now they are available with more detailed prints on bluray so as to appreciate the textures of the wood, the fabrics, the skin of the very characters themselves in these two finely shot pieces.  What more could anyone ask?

My only kvetches about these two movies are minor: the second movie is maybe 20 minutes too long-lasting the director gets a little too fond of multiple cuts in the last big battle scene and it loses some continuity for me.  There's also a major change in tone from the first movie but that is in the source material also and really could not be avoided while remaining true to Dumas.  These films stick very close to the book overall and that's worth a high rating of itself.  Too many adaptations take gross liberties with the storyline.

When I came across both movies on DVD for a great price, I couldn't pass it up.  Once I got it, I watched both movies in one sitting.  It looks great on DVD and the way these movies hold up over time still amazes me.  The fight scenes are still great, the dialog is funny, and the authenticity of the set blows today's CGI crap away.

1193016,5,B000006DAL,"Richard Lester (A Hard Day's Night, Help, Superman II, Petulia, Robin & Marian) directed The THREE MUSKETEERS in 1973 fully expecting to release a single film at three hours length. Instead it was decided to split them in two and release them as THREE MUSKETEERS and FOUR MUSKETEERS. While it must have been difficult to re-adjust the pacing for stand-alone films instead of a single 1st, 2nd, and 3rd act film- you wouldn't know it. Both films are brilliant works of action adventure, farce, ribald humor, and pure cinema escapism.  You can FEEL the celluloid 'parental D.N.A.' of movies that would follow this example: STAR WARS, RAIDERS, PRINCESS BRIDE, THE MUMMY, etc.
The cast from top to bottom is peerless; and the action scenes are SO inventive, you don't know how they can keep topping them! Obviously, many have 'borrowed' from these films over the years- but they still feel fresh and not dated. If you love stuff like RAIDERS, you'll love this. (No supernatural element, but Raquel Welch IS kind of a special effect!)
I don't think there is any finer rendering of the classic on film. Yeah, it takes some liberties to amp up the fun, but why carp? Nice to have both films in one BLU-ray package. Go buckle your swash! All for one!
**NOTE- If you are/become a fan, note that years later, in 1989(!), LESTER returned to make a sequel. RETURN OF THE MUSKETEERS. All the principles returned (adding C. Thomas Howell?!!), and the result was pretty good.",1396915200,3,1460,4.770750988142293

1193019,4,B000006DAL,"I have seen many of the movie versions of the Dumas tale and this is my favorite, by far. Adhering more closely to the novel than other movies, it tells the tale of a poor nobleman, d'Artagnan, who travels from Gascony to Paris to join the King's Musketeers by way of letter from his father to the commander of the Musketeers, Monsieur de Treville. At an inn along the road, he confronts an older man, feels himself affronted by the man's ridicule of his horse and challenges him to a duel, only to be beaten by the man's escort. Robbed of his letter, he still meets with Mon. de Treville, who cannot accept his application without the letter. At a window, d'Artagnan recognizes the older man and rushes out of the office only to do affront to three Musketeers who are in the hall forcing him to schedule duels with the three. Failing to catch the older man, who we learn is the Comte de Rochefort, an agent of Cardinal Richelieu.

D'Artagnan must still face the three Musketeers and goes to his first appointment. He introduces himself to Athos, a fearsome soldier and swordsman. Athos' seconds are Aramis and Porthos, d'Artagnan's next opponents. As he and Athos begin to cross swords, the Cardinal's guards arrive to enforce the no dueling law. Though outnumbered, Athos, Porthos and Aramis refuse to be arrested and begin to battle the guards. D'Artagnan throws himself into the fray against the guards. The four overcome the guards, with d'Artagnan doing serious injury to Jussac, a renowned fighter.

So begins the adventures of the Three Musketeers and d'Artagnan. Through a service to the queen, they acquit themselves as heroes and friends. It would be difficult and somewhat redundant to recount all of their adventures, suffice to say that the four men have become the epitome of valor and friendship. Through the second movie, ""The Four Musketeers"" we learn the origin of Athos' resentment of women and retirement from the world.

What sets Richard Leslie's version apart from other offerings is the natural feel of the movie. Costumes, conduct, social environment, etc., all feel eighteenth century. Just enough elegant drabness to support the period. Yes, clothing is elegant, but with just enough sleaze to round off the corners, so to speak. Their swordplay is not beautifully choreographed fencing, but brutal thuggery, fought with knives, swords, clubs, anything at hand, which is exactly how, I have read, battles were fought in the 1750's. The cinematography and sets are wonderful evoking the landscape of a undeveloped France countryside.

There is sly humor, as in the delicious rendering of a slightly cuckoo Constance de Bonacieux by an astounding Raquel Welch and the clunky athleticism of Michael York (as d'Artagnan). Performances by Charlton Heston, Oliver Reed, Faye Dunaway, Frank Finlay and Richard Chamberlain bring these characters and novels to vivid life. One can smell the dust in the taverns, the perfumed handkerchiefs to keep the odors of the world away from one's nose and the smell of cordite in the firing of muskets.

This is my favorite cinematic rendering of the novels. In my opinion, all others have too narrow a focus on the story, emphasizing one part over another, one character over another or eliminating all but the basic tale. By way of contrast, the 2011 version starring Logan Lerman and Orlando Bloom has been my least favorite. Get these DVDs and enjoy a rollicking tale of adventure.",1395619200,3,3443,4.9601386481802425

of this classic) this one by Alexandre Salkind is about the lousiet ! This movie is about the Three (or four) Musketeers...the greatest
and famous swordsmen in old France under Louis 13th. This means they must show in the movie a lot of fencing, swordsplay and
duellings. It is here that I was thoroughly disappointed....there were no TRUE fencing but a LOT of horsing around...punching, kicking ,
jumping and .....minimal swordsplay !  You see, fencing is an art, an acquired skill which needs lots and lots of practice, which skill
these guys had none (except perhaps Richard Chamberlain... the ""Count of Monte Cristo"" ?). So they disguised this defect with lots of
of punching and kicking ! No this won't do! You cannot substitute fencing and swashbuckling with kicking. And the worst was Michael
York who was supposed to be D'Artagnan...he just couldn't live up to that famous swordsman D'Artagnan...he knows nuts about
fencing ! And there's his girl friend Constance....whose supposed to be sweet and goody....Here she is somebody's wife...a married
woman sleeping with a rouge D'Artagnan, taking advantage of her! Do you want your kids to see this infidelity ?

1193023,5,B000006DAL,"Folks who criticize the change in tone of this duology clearly haven't read the work it was based on.  Dumas' novel begins as a light hearted adventure and then shifts to a darker tone.  So do these movies.  Beginning as a brilliant comedy based on the novel-- but not necessarily true to every detail--this magnificently costumed period epic is a joy to watch, and by far the best musketeer movie ever made.  The darker notes toward the end give the story a depth that is lacking in the usual rehash. The movies are a visual feast, and except for some liberties taken with Raquel Welch's costume, both settings and costumes are amazingly accurate.  Combat scenes are varied and interesting, often amusing in their choreography, and the showdown between two female characters trying to kill each other while dealing with their voluminous period gowns is a classic.

The film is written and directed superbly, delivering an amusing action-adventure film that also has the depth of serious literature.  In fact, everything about this film is of top quality - acting, editing, cinematography, set and costume design, makeup, and exceptionally well staged and plausible sword fights.

The Star list and acting, 5 stars.  The story line, and the way it was presented, 5 stars.  The movie wase done in a way that you felt like you was there, at that time.  And it was done in a light hearted way, almost humorous in some areas; a pleasant presentation.  The Four Musketeers, in blu ray, had the same quality.

Michael York is spectacular as the impetuous and earnest D'Artagnan, Faye Dunaway represents the evil Milady with passion, while Charlton Heston portrays Cardinal Richelieu with an effective combination of subtlety and sinister machinations.  Oliver Reed and Richard Chamberlain are huge favorites of mine, based on ""Oliver"" and ""Count of Monte Cristo"" performances.  However, as a teacher, I appreciate this production's commitment to Dumas' novel.  Most of the plot is represented well, and the period costumes and sets are accurate.  Mme.

THE MOVIES as a set is in my top 25 movies of ALL TIME!
Is that enough praise? Or to much? The very idea of a set of primarily 'British' actors coming together to play a group of the most famous Frenchmen in the history of the country. It's unintentionally amusing when Michael York tells the duke of Buckingham (with his o'so British accent) that his First duty is to FRANCE!
IMHO the opening credits of the 3 Musketeers with the slow swords and building music is hands down the best opening credits in the history of cinema. And Mr. Heston receives 4 stars by himself for the funniest scene I've ever seen him in just by picking up a potato!
This amazing ensemble cast, every one of them who alone could carry a movie put their 'bloody back into' bringing us a romp that stands above most of the trash that's being put out nowadays.
The Three Musketeers is no new story in cinema. The story was first told as a silent movie and was remade as one of the first talkies.

The contrast is a tad light, rendering night-for-day scenes as regular daylight (prompting a smile when the Duke of Buckingham spears of 'in the middle of the night' and the sun is shining), but that's the tiniest of quibbles compared to the incredible improvements this version has over any other release of these films.

Mind you the 1948 version had better swordplay but that was the era of over the top fights and a little over acting by Kelly.

1193071,5,B000006DAL,"These are two of the best swash-bucklers going, with a great cast and energetic direction from Richard Lester. I treasure these movies for the additional reason that the wonderful George MacDonald Fraser (of ""Flashman"" fame) wrote the screenplays, and probably had great fun doing so. The production values are superior (wonderful costumes and sets), and the swordplay different from strict swordplay--these guys were fighting to win, and swords were just one of a variety of weapons they used--the others being knees, elbows, feet, and yes, furniture. Probably more realistic than ""pure"" swordplay, now that I think of it.

One problem with these discs--the sound is indeed a bit muffled, and I had to crank the volume *way* up to hear all the dialogue. I hope subsequent releases of these discs will have the sound corrected.

Overall--comedy/action/romance/court intrigue/historical background. A great combination!",1346025600,2,918,5.50354609929078
1193072,4,B000006DAL,"I've had a good DVD of these two movies for some time, but have been hoping for a Blu-ray upgrade that would add a lot of value to the package. Having found myself in a Three Musketeers mood, I decided to go with this set. I was pleased at how good the picture looks: sharp, good color, well-lit (sometimes a bit TOO well, which can wash out the picture slightly, but those are rare instances). One of the fights toward the end of the movie appeared to have some strange color flashes. I went back to my DVD to check them out, and confirmed that they were intentional parts of the movie (they are fireworks occurring simultaneously with the action). But the Blu-ray has them in solid colors, while the DVD shows them almost as gray. Definite improvement in the visuals.

However, the sound mix leaves a lot to be desired. It's no worse than the DVD, but no improvement, either. It's basically 2.0 Mono (why not 1.0?), but the dialogue is often difficult to understand completely. It's not helped by director Richard Lester's trademark use of ADR, adding bits of dialogue that were clearly not recorded during the shot. And with the often-mentioned lack of English subtitles, there's no compensatory factor. There are subtitles for several other languages; why not English??? The music, on the other hand, sounds very good, particularly Michel Legrand's score on the first film. No criticism intended to the great Lalo Schifrin on the second; I just wish that some of the incredible chords and instrumental harmonies that Legrand wrote for ""Three"" would have been reprised on ""Four"".

I'm tempted to take yet another star off the package for the lack of extras. The DVD set had a two-part documentary, one part on the first disc, the other on the second. Those are missing here. And there is still no commentary for these classic movies. I'm giving the set four stars primarily for the picture upgrade, and for the fact that these films are still refreshingly enjoyable. I'd still like to see a sound and feature improvement on Blu in future.",1345334400,5,2041,4.730337078651686

The script is intelligent and witty, the action superb, the actors excellent. The adaptations made after this are third rate but this one shines. Charlton Heston, in a small role, is the perfect Cardinal Richelieu. Thought the only flaw was Michael York's casting as D'Artagnan. He did a good job but just didn't really think he fit in the role. But others may well disagree.

1193074,5,B000006DAL,"There are a number of different takes on the tale of The Three Musketeers, and out of all of them, I feel this one stays closest to the flavor of the original story.  While it does get a bit carried away at times with humorous bits that exist only in this particular production, and has a LOT of continuity issues (mostly involving swords that mysteriously reappear when they'd make an action awkward, and reappear conveniently in the next shot), it's a very enjoyable telling of the tale, and for all that it was filmed in the early 70's, it does have a certain timeless appeal...I don't feel like I'm watching a forty-year-old film when I watch it.

I know some won't care for it...it does build a lot of the plot around marital infidelities, that other productions either gloss over casually or re-write, and I have some friends who dislike it on the basis of how strong adulterous relationships are, in terms of plot devices.  However, that's one of the things that makes it very faithful to the original story.  The humor can get a little bawdy, at times, but never crosses over to being crude or crass, and I remember watching this as a little kid and being utterly enchanted by it.

The passage of the years hasn't changed that...it's still one of my all-time favorites.",1340150400,3,1277,4.607929515418502

It was with a packed theatre up in Connecticut and the audience had a blast. Richard Lester's style of directing was still fresh back then and it was like watching this huge, mega-star epic as if done by Monty Python. Now, 38 years later, it just seems tired and getting through scene after scene of the musketeers fighting, 3 Stooges - style, is just tedious. I can't deny the excellent performances, especially by Oliver Reed, Christopher Lee and Charlton Heston, and Michel Legrand's enchanting score is perfect for the film. However, the rediculous faux ""love scenes"" between Michael York and Raquel Welch on one hand and Simon Ward and Geraldine Chaplin on the other are worn out. I guess I can recommend this film to first time viewers, but unfortunately, like some other previously tresured gems, it wears out it's welcome on repeated viewings. I would WHOLE HEARTEDLY RECOMMEND the 1993 WALT DISNEY VERSION which stars Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell, Charlie Sheen, Oliver Platt, Rebecca DeMornay and Tim Curry.

Looking at the reviews for this dvd release it seems like Anchor Bay has done a great job. I do not yet have this release and am not in a position to comment on the dvd quality.
The purpose of this review is really to give my thumbs up for Richard Lester's Three Musketeers movie adaptions and to ask if Amazon has any other Richard Lester films for sale - particularly am referring to the sequel to this 2 part adaption  called 'The Return of the Three Muskerteers' filmed in 1989. Have been searching for this but no luck to date.
Does anyone who are fans of or who like Richard Lester's 'Three Muskerteers' know where I can get hold of the sequel 'The Return of the Muskerteer'?

There were no apparent negative consequences for these behaviors. The whole thing was rather confusing and after a while boring. The fighting was unrealistic and the costumes rather ridiculous.  I gave it 3 stars because it has a stellar cast and because I have to admit that the movie is not unlike the book, giving a somewhat satirical account of the mores and politics of the period.

1193093,5,B000006DAL,"An all-star cast brings the best-loved of Alexandre Dumas's long string of historical novels to the big screen in one of the best and most enjoyable of the 1970s' crop of movies.  Director Richard Lester and scriptwriter George Macdonald Fraser (best known for the picaresque novels following the adventures of Harry Flashman of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Brown-s-School-Days/dp/B004K6LY8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom Brown's School Days</a>) sensibly decided to tell the story in two parts to allow full scope for its complexities.  In the first half, the young Gascon D'Artagnan (Michael York), whose father served ""the late King Henry,"" arrives in the Paris of King Louis XIII (Jean-Pierre Cassel) seeking a commission in the King's Musketeers, falls afoul of the patch-eyed Rochefort (Christopher Lee), and first offends and then befriends the three best swordsmen (and brawlers) in the corps--gloomy Athos (Oliver Reed), vain Porthos (Frank Finlay), and dandy-lover-intended priest Aramis (Richard Chamberlain).  When he falls in love with his landlord's young wife Constance (Raquel Welch), who serves Queen Anne (Geraldine Chaplin) as personal dressmaker, D'Artagnan and his friends are drawn into a whirlwind of intrigue as the powerful Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston) and his beautiful agent, Milady deWinter (Faye Dunaway), attempt to disgrace the Queen by exposing her love affair with the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward), England's prime minister.  The second half, darker and more violent, continues their clashes with the Cardinal, Milady, and Rochefort against the background of the religious wars between the Catholics and Huguenots of France.

Besides the wonderfully choreographed swordfights (which often include any and every underhanded tactic in the book) and York's surprisingly effective portrayal of a country innocent (he was 31 at the time of the first movie's release but manages to appear little more than 20), what really makes the film work is the ambience of it.  It's clear that Lester and his crew immersed themselves in the social and material atmosphere of the 17th century, where great luxury and appalling poverty existed almost side by side, nobles were arrogant yet honor was a buzzword, and fantastically opulent dress was worn by people walking through filthy streets.  Heston, Dunaway, and Lee provide a triumvirate of villainy of the kind you love to hate--especially Heston's Richelieu, who clearly thinks he's in the right.  (It would be nice, admittedly, to have some explanation of *why* Richelieu so hated Anne of Austria.)  Best suited to teens and adults but a thoroughly enjoyable romp, this duology defines ""classic swashbuckler"" as nothing has since the days of Errol Flynn.",1303171200,12,2788,5.698795180722891

No other films capture the humor, the sweep, and the camaraderie as these two films from 1974.  The casting is excellent, across the board, and the film transfer on this Anchor Bay release is vivid.

My only caveat with Lester's vision: the fencing almost always devolves into a fight with fists, furniture, and laundry.  I wish he'd stuck to the classic Fred Cavan's-style dueling.  Still, that's a minor quibble with an otherwise splendid pair of films.

Sorry Raquel, yes you look wonderful but out of period.  The pace of the movies is brisk but there is still ample time for the viewer to look deeper into the characters.  Oliver Reed is such a treasure as Athos!  All of the acting is competent but he simply shines in his own dark way.  My quibbles are strictly cosmetic.  There are a few jarring things to me that most wouldn't notice.  Milady de Winter's pistol is just a Philadelphia derringer from the 1850s.  Only off by two hundred years.  And Athos forgets to remove the spanner from his wheel-lock when he confronts Milady.  He's risking a couple of beat up fingers if he pulls the trigger.  And the two pistols in Milady's carriage are Harper's Ferry flintlocks from about 1804.  The swordplay may be the most realistic ever filmed and is a joy to watch again and again.  The commentaries on each disk are quite enlightening and do add to the package and lend even more enjoyment to viewing the finished product.  Forget all of the other versions!

I watch this movie in french in the late seventies and the traduction was also excellent.,1286064000,,348,4.629032258064516
1193110,4,B000006DAL,"This film, aside from being one of the most faithful and best cast versions of the Musketeers story by Dumas I can remember seeing, is a Rembrandt painting that moves! With VERY faithful costuming and better than average cinematography, there is also a realism and wit to it that few previous versions had. The only standout as a concession to Hollywood thinking in the cast is plastic Richard Chamberlain as Aramis, kind of a peripheral character to begin with. Another criticism is a blasphemous throwaway scene involving a mental case with a smudge pot on his head in the middle of the film.

The actor to watch in this film is Oliver Reed, whose Athos is the center of the film and the small Musketeer band that is the center of the story itself. The rest of the cast is a quintessential 70's A-list of actors: Faye Dunaway, still hot as a pistol after ""Bonnie & Clyde"" and ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" plays the scheming Lady De Winter; Raquel Welch, in what is her best movie to date, plays a bumbling Constance Boniceur; Simon Ward, two years off of ""Young Winston"" plays the Duke of Buckingham (he's also, oddly enough, the most French-looking character in the movie in his ""Duke"" makeup despite the fact that his character is decidedly English!); Michael York, whose ""Murder On The Orient Express"" and ""Logan's Run"" made him a semi-superstar along with this movie, plays the young D'Artagnon; Frank Finlay, an obscure actor who nonetheless lets his hamminess make for an enjoyably vain Porthos; Charlton Heston as Cardinal Richelieu, (good casting,); Geraldine Chaplin, (Charlie's daughter,) as Queen Anne; Christopher Lee as Rocheforte and Richard Lester's trademark repertoire man, Roy Kinnear, as Blanchet. They all come together to make a movie, (split into two for length,) that is without a doubt the best version of this story in wide release in the last forty years. At least that I'VE ever seen!

Oliver Reed's Athos is parlayed perfectly....Reed really seems to get into the period mindset and the character's ""elder statesmen"" cast. He also heartily throws himself into the brawls they have, taking young D'Artagnon under his wing, reveling in the spirit and fun of the role as the band's ""wise man"", and probably doing the most furious fighting of all the actors. Michael York is also perfect as D'Artagnon, having just the right attitude of semi-reckless adeptness as the young Gascon. Welch comes off a bit like a bubblehead in her role of Constance Boniceur, but she was STILL a knockout! Dunaway gives us a hint of what her ""Network"" Oscar-winning role will be like as the vicious Lady De Winter, a former paramour of Athos, and a future paramour of the callow D'Artagnon. Christopher Lee is in what is probably HIS best role to date as Rocheforte, Cardinal Richelieu's own man Friday.

For some reason, only Blanchet is represented of the Musketeer manservants, although, in the Dumas original, ALL the fellows had assistants that followed them through 2/3 of the story. Athos' attach, Grimaud, AAMOF, had more story time than Blanchet, but there you have it. The Gene Kelly version of this story, (well photographed but laughable,) did the same thing, excluding ALL the other right-hand men except D'Artagnon's! Lester is obviously following this predecessor's lead, but that is the ONLY lead he follows in this movie! Kinnear plays Blanchet comically, pretty much like he played Victor Spinetti's assistant in ""Help!""

I would recommend this even over the more recent and to me cheesy Disney version that certain members of the brat pack starred in.

1193119,4,B000006DAL,"Everybody knows (at least vaguely) about ""The Three Musketeers"" -- evil cardinals, diamonds, and a gang of rather riotous guys whose motto is ""All for one and one for all."" Fortunately the two-part story of ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers"" has plenty of charm even if you've read Alexandre Dumas' original novel -- they sparkle with humor, romance, swordplay and political plotting.

Farm lad D'Artagnan (Michael York) arrives in Paris to try to become one of the king's elite Musketeers. After being challenged to three duels within five minutes, D'Artagnan ends up befriending three of the Musketeers: wry alcoholic Athos (Oliver Reed), naughty priest Aramis (Richard Chamberlain), and lovable fop Porthos (Frank Finlay). Even though D'Artagnan isn't a Musketeer yet, the three Musketeers take a liking to him -- as does his landlord's sexy wife, the queen's lady-in-waiting Constance (Raquel Welch).

However, the evil Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston) is seeking to overthrow the queen, who is having an affair with the Duke of Buckingham. So he arranges for her infidelity to be exposed by a pair of ruthless assassins, Milady de Winter and Comte de Rocheforte (Faye Dunaway and Christopher Lee). But Constance gets D'Artagnan to go to England to retrieve the gems the queen gave the Duke, along with the help of the three Musketeers.

""The Four Musketeers"" is the second half of the original novel, and appropriately called ""Milady's Revenge."" Milady is, unsurprisingly, very peeved that the Musketeers thwarted her in the previous film. So she gets a special pardon ""in advance"" from the Cardinal -- she wants to murder D'Artagnan and Constance, and be unscathed by any punishment.

D'Artagnan sends Constance to a convent, hoping that that will keep her safe. Then, idiotically, he starts an affair with Milady, only to discover the harlot's brand on her shoulder. Milady's machinations spread over the English channel to engulf the Duke of Buckingham. Now only the four Musketeers can hope to bring Milady to justice -- but not before a terrible price is paid.

The art of the action-comedy is pretty much lost -- making action funny. And ""The Complete Musketeers"" is a prime example of that. One good example is the fight with the Cardinal's guards, where Aramis gleefully dodges sword thrusts, and Porthos attacks with rocks and sticks. Another is the scene where the Musketeers use a fake fight to shoplift food.

But the film never quite descends to slapstick, and there is plenty of drama and even tragedy, as one of the important characters dies, and others reveal not-so-pleasant secrets. The sets are outstanding, lavish and full of detail. And the scripting is equally solid, getting across plenty of information in a series of solid one-liners.

All four of the Musketeers are outstanding: York has that naive Luke Skywalker vibe, while Finlay is a lovable hothead, Chamberlin a charming rogue priest, and Reed a tormented soul. Raquel Welch gets to play a fun, comedic character as the clumsy Constance (who, as soon as we see her, falls down the stairs). Heston seems to be relishing the role of a bad guy, and Christopher Lee exudes icy menace as the Comte. Faye Dunaway is also excellent, though she doesn't get to shine until ""Four Musketeers.""

The spirit of Alexandre Dumas seems to live on in the solid, entertaining, tragic, action-filled ""Three Musketeers"" and ""Four Musketeers"" It's a period piece with a wink and nudge.",1268438400,9,3469,5.084358523725835

While it does have some very funny moments as well as some ridiculous incidents, it's much more serious than most of the Musketeers movies made both before and after this version.  It brings to life the time, court and politics of the original books.  This is probably the best adaptations of the Dumas novels on screen.  The cast is stellar and everyone is perfect for their parts.  See it and enjoy the world of Dumas through the glories of film.  I can't think of many movie watching pleasures of action/adventure as well as politics as much as this set.  Enjoy, everyone.",1267660800,,687,4.628099173553719
1193121,5,B000006DAL,"This was a big budget production all the way - all star cast, first rate director, and all that. But what really makes this movie stand out for me is the no expenses spared wardrobe, set, and location shots. Everything about this movie looks like it was shot in 17th century France (and England).

This version really plays up the slapstick and comedic elements without breaking faith with Dumas' classic novel. The fencing scenes are really first rate. The producers really seem to have done their homework on the style of weapons and techniques of the period. Check out the number of times a combatant has a blade in each hand - a longer one for offense, a shorter for protection.

The DVDs are really well done. On each disk there are both widescreen and full screen versions. Extras include the Saga of the Musketeers and the Making of the Three Musketeers shorts, trailers, TV and radio spots, cast bios, and still gallery. Perhaps too much was packed on each disk because there are a few places where artifacting is evident.

1193124,5,B000006DAL,"This is a great movie series! Despite the slapstick, the film sticks very close to the original material. The swordfights are incredible - no sped up wizardly or silly prancing about. It's tough and gritty with the slapstick actually giving the fights a grim humor of the slip-ups which could occur in real situations.

All the actors are superb - Oliver Reed very much fits the role of Athos on and off screen, Michael York is excellent as the dashing but bumbling country bumpkin turned hero, Finlay and Chamberlain play off each other well thru-out the films with their banter, Charleston Heston as the scheming Cardinal Richelieu an odd but very effective choice, Faye Dunaway as one of film's scariest assassin femme fatale, Raquel Welch as the goodnatured but clumsy Constance, and Christopher Lee as the villainous Rochefort - older than the musketeers but more than their match. There's also Spike Milligan whose hilarious as the innkeeper and Roy Kinnear as York's hapless porter.

The DVD extras are bit thinner than one would like such as no subtitles only captions but you get a 25 minute saga on both DVDs with interviews of Lee, York, Welch, producer Salkind, Heston, and two others. You learn how real the stunts and sword fights were and the cuts and bruises the actors incurred. Heston recounts a great line of the historical Richelieu which director Lester when told of it by Heston insisted that the line be put into the film.

Heston's Richelieu I feel is one of the best representations of the character because he didn't go in for chewing the scenery as Tim Curry's character does in the 1993 version. His Richelieu was not so much an evil villain but a true politician who you believe honestly wanted to help France - in his own way, of course. I know some dislike Heston for his other scene-chewing roles and his later NRA stance but here he gives an excellent  performance of a dynamic, complex character who dominates everyone and everything with a quiet but powerful presence.

If you like adventure and action, get this DVD today! You won't be disappointed!",1241136000,3,2085,4.812849162011173

Oliver Reed, Michael York, Charleton Heston, Christopher Lee, Richard Chamberlain, Faye Dunaway, Raquel Welch...what a cast!!! a truly outstanding adventure/action film, a true classic!

1193140,5,B000006DAL,"Everything about these two movies is first rate.  The production, direction, script, and performances deserve high praise.  The music and locations are excellent.

These movies are a template for future adventure stores.  They perfectly mix action, suspense, humor, and romance.

I think the producers intended to make two movies all along.  They had a single script and must have known the relationship between script length and movie length.  The two movies sometimes have parallel scenes.  For example, in both movies the musketeers have meals under unusal circumstances.  There are sword fights in unusual environments.  The first movie has a sword fight at night in the woods.  The combatants can barely see each other.  The second movie has a sword fight on ice.  The duelists often fall down.  These scenes would have been redundant in a single, epic length picture.

The musketeers seem to have influenced the initial Star Wars movies:

1.  D'Artagnon is a young man from the provinces who becomes the center of major events.  Luke Skywalker is a young man from an outlier planet who becomes the center of major events.

2.  The musketeers fight duels with swords.  Star Wars uses light sabres.

3.  In The Four Musketeers, D'Artagnon's hand is badly cut in a duel.  In The Empire Strikes back, Luke loses a hand.

4.  The musketeers mentor D'Artagnon.  Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda mentor Luke.

5.  The Four Musketeers identifies a past relationship between two enemies.  Ditto for The Empire Strikes Back.

6.  The Three Musketeers ends with the king and queen presiding over a ceremony where D'Artagnons receives awards. Star Wars ends with the princess presiding over a ceremony where Luke and his colleagues receive awards.

7.  The Four Musketeers is more serious than The Three Musketeers.  The Empire Strikes Back is more serious than Star Wars.

As for the films themselves, what can be said? The acting is top notch: Heston is a fantastic, understated Richelieu, York seems to have been born to play D'Artagnan, and everyone else is cast perfectly as well.

But when it's based on a book with the caliber of romantic heroes such as D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis - that is a crime.

Alexander Dumas wrote two great books; The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo. I encourage you to read the books instead of watching the movies.

1193183,4,B000006DAL,"When this movie was originally filmed, the actors had been told that they were making one movie, and it was filmed as such.  What they didn't know, though, was that the studio had it edited as two movies, and if my memory serves me correctly, the actors did not know about this until the premier, when the film ended at what should have roughly been the half-way point!  They were a bit perplexed.  They were also quite upset.  And, when the studio told them that they had to reshoot some scenes for the ""second"" movie, they all refused!  They had been paid the fee for making one movie when two were in fact made!  The studio finally gave in and the actors got the money they deserved.

That aside, I enjoyed both of these movies.  While I agree that it can be disturbing when scenes in a movie are shot out of sequence, I understand that movies by their nature are different from books.  With all the information being compressed into an obviously much shorter time frame the scenes, if present as they were written, might not flow smoothly on the big screen.  So, I can forgive some ""screen writer's justice"" when they convert a book to a script.  In my opinion, this movie doesn't alter the book in any way that is a mutation (like the heavily doctored love story in Last of the Mohicans, but I won't get started on that!) of the original work.

So, if you love swashbuckling with some humor thrown in, and if you enjoy the ever lovely Ms. Welch, then plop these movies in your DVD player, sit back, and enjoy them!",1164585600,2,1519,4.405017921146953

True, the book has 67 chapters and covers a lot of 'ground' in telling the story. However, taking some of the events out of sequence with the book is something I have always disliked about going from novel to film. And purposely making the story go into an obvious sequel to tell the second half of the book...

Originally it was to be one long movie. However the producers did what they did with Kill Bill, divided this epic up into two parts...the Three and Four Musketeers.

These two films had an all star international cast  which will rival any version (including the Disney ones) of the Musketeers. Such Stars as Charles Heston, Christopher Lee, Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlain, Simon Ward, Micheal York, Rachael Welch, and Faye Dunaway brought this production to life. The action and adventure was partion with comedy and It works well

And the humor...it doesn't hurt that the screenplay was written by the superb and sly George McDonald Fraser of ""Flashman"" fame...(if you haven't partaken of the Flashman novels you should seek them out immediately - that is, if you like this sort of raucous, swashbuckling thing)....

1193203,5,B000006DAL,"The Musketeers of the King of France were created in order to give the sons of aristocratic families the chance to fight, brawl and go adventuring, all with the official sanction of the King himself. One wonders if this was in order to channel all of the restless energy of the idle rich into a more productive vein than thoughts of royal insurrection. This pair of films captures all the fun, friendship, loyalty, intrigue, and adventure of the timeless novel by Alexandre Dumas.

One of its greatest strengths is the creation of a fully realized period setting; one that seems to exist far beyond the range of the camera lens. For instance, if you listen carefully, you can hear the muttered comments of the servant class, a people who tended to exist below the sightlines and notice of the nobility. Example: one of the carriers of Milady DeWinter's sedan-chair. ""My bloody arms! Why doesn't she get a horse?"". Another fine example of this is the army of little people who bear trays of sweets and cakes on their heads at the royal ball. As King Louis XIII selects a dainty from one platter, its bearer exclaims: ""He's having one of mine! He's eating it!"" The King and the other nobles are completely oblivious. Who listens to servants? The audience does, and delights in looking into the corners of this intriguing world.

""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers"" are also notable for the astonishing swordplay depicted in the numerous fight scenes. The 1940's version starring Gene Kelly was very entertaining, but the swordplay was a little unrealistic; all flashing swords and fancy footwork. In Richard Lester's version, the fights are real fights, with kicking, punching, biting, and wrestling all thrown in with the clashing of rapiers. The duellists get winded and exhausted, as they would in real life. And the films portray a mind-boggling assortment of fights in every conceivable setting: a convent courtyard, a steaming laundry room, a dark forest lit only by hooded lanterns, a frozen  river, a burning stable, the chapel of an abbey, the list goes on and on. Because I never tire of watching these great films, I have always possessed copies of them; at first a poor-quality full-screen VHS tape, with grainy resolution and a number of scenes excised. Then in the initial DVD release, which looks beautiful on screen and has most of the missing scenes restored. It has no extras, however, and I'm looking forward to purchasing the new ""Complete Musketeers"" DVD release. If you've never seen these films, don't wait one more day. Treat yourself to Richard Lester's blend of high drama and low slapstick as soon as possible!",1135987200,5,2648,4.90625
1193224,4,B000006DAL,"Of all of the Musketeer movies, I consider these second only to the most recent ""Man in the Iron Mask"" (see below).

For some reason, I liked these movies better than the older one starring Alan Hale, aka the Skipper from Gilligans Island.  I did not at all like the newer one starring Dom Delouise's son, Charlie Sheen, etc. The Complete Musketeers just seemed to better capture the flavor of the period better: sword duels, rivalries, forbidden romantic liasions, war, and political intrigue.

However, the action, plot, screen writing, and sets/costumes in the Man in the Iron Mask with Leo DiCapprio, John Malkovich, Gerard Depardeau, etc. were better. (True enough this wasn't a true ""Three Musketeer"" movie in the strictest sense, it did incorporate the same characters in a sequel story).  The Complete Musketeers and Man in the Iron Mask differ in that the Complete Musketeers are more light-hearted and offer some slapstick comedy, the Man in the Iron Mask was intended to be more dramtaic to capture the anguish of a fathers loss and thirst for revenge.

The action scenes in the Complete Musketeer series are gritty and there is plenty of light-hearted banter in the first movie (The Three Musketeers). The second movie (The Four Musketeers) is definitely darker.  The gorgeous Rachel Welch is strangled for revenge by Lady De Winter who in turn is beheaded at the request of Athos, her former lover, for her crimes.

I particularly like the fact that the director of the Complete Musketeers did not depict a sanitized version of this period of history for the audience.  Filthy streets resmebling open sewers, animals, mud, dust, and a city over crowded and teeming with life are all there to fill out the screen.",1129248000,4,1725,4.924137931034482
1193225,5,B000006DAL,"This pair of films is almost certainly the finest film version not only of The Three Musketeers, but of any of Dumas' novels.  While it may not be truly ""great,"" it is superbly made and one (or rather two) of the most enjoyable films I have ever seen.  Under Richard Lester's direction, it is a light-hearted adventure story, but with enough genuine edge for those who demand some dramatic tension.

George MacDonald Fraser's screenplay (full of clever, sharp dialogue) sticks much closer to the Dumas original than do other adaptations of The Three Musketeers, most of which transform the story into a standard good guys vs. bad guys plot with little more substance than the average B-Western (e.g., the more recent, one-step-above-awful Sutherland/Sheen/O'Donnell version).  The Lester/Fraser version is essentially about four friends trying to survive and be true to each other (and, oh yes, to enjoy life along the way) while getting caught up in the neverending intrigues of the court of Louis XIII of France.  The Musketeers are not conventional heroes, and with the partial exception of Milady, their opponents are not conventional villains.

Besides superb direction and a great script, these films have a fantastic cast.  All of the Musketeers come across as sharply drawn individuals.  Michael York is a very suitably nave, impetuous D'Artagnan.  Richard Chamberlain makes a perfectly suave and sophisticated Aramis, the future priest, and his foil Porthos is brought to boastful but good-hearted life by Frank Finlay.  Best of all is Oliver Reed's melancholy Athos, who gives the film some of the ""edge"" I spoke of above.

Two other cast members give performances as good as anything they have ever done.  Charlton Heston is a tremendous Cardinal Richelieu, subtle, intelligent, ever-scheming, but capable of taking a temporary setback with good grace.  Raquel Welch may have given the finest performance of her career as D'Artagnan's lady-love, Constance, the queen's lovely but accident-prone dressmaker.

Richelieu is ably served by Christopher Lee as a rugged, dangerous Rochefort and by Faye Dunaway as a ruthless Milady.  The intelligent actor Jean-Pierre Cassel portrays the near-idiot Louis XIII very well, while Geraldine Chaplin succeeds in winning some of our sympathy for the selfish and spoiled Anne of Austria, his queen.  Rounding out this impressive case are Roy Kinnear as Planchet, D'Artagnan's servant, Spike Milligan as Constance's husband, and Simon Ward as the Duke of Buckingham.

One of the best things about this pair of films is the quality of the fight scenes.  They combine a high level of excitement with a very realistic feel.  One noteworthy touch is that each of the Musketeers shows an individual fighting style--e.g., D'Artagnan is a whirlwind of speed, while the older Athos fights more of a battle of attrition, wearing his opponent down.  Another plus is that each fight scene has its own clear identity--they never seem repetitive.

Like the fight scenes, the overall look of the film seems authentic.  I am no expert on 17th century France to truly judge, but the sets and costumes give a great appearance of realism.  Each film has a separate score, the first by Michel Legrand (with a bit borrowed from Giuseppe Verdi), the second by Lalo Schifrin.  Both are quite effective.

The DVD offers the choice of either the full-screen or wide-screen versions.  Even on a modest sized 20-inch TV, I preferred the latter.  The primary extra is a featurette titled ""The Saga of the Musketeers.""  Appropriately, given that the originally intended one film was split into two features, the featurette is split into two parts, one on each disc.  It is very good, with interviews with co-producer Ilya Salkind and several cast members-York, Welch, Finlay, Heston and Lee, as I recall.  One nice element is a sort of ""in memoriam"" segment saluting cast members Oliver Reed, Roy Kinnear and Spike Milligan, all of whom died before the release of the DVD.

For some 40 years, from classics like ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" and ""The Sea Hawk"" down through John Huston's ""The Man Who Would Be King,"" Hollywood turned out great adventure films that had more to offer than just special effects and slam-bang action set-pieces.  Although the Salkind Musketeers films were not Hollywood productions, they are worthy to stand among the very best films in that tradition.",1127865600,12,4395,5.129213483146067
1193226,5,B000006DAL,"Except for the obvious (and deplorable) faux pas in Raquel Welch's personal changes to her character's costuming (evidently if she'd worn the correct costuming for the period her most important assets - her boobs - wouldn't have been as prominently featured) it's absolutely beautifully done.

Plus it's FUNNY! Turn UP the volume to make sure you catch all of the murmured asides cause they're worth hearing!

1193227,4,B000006DAL,"Forget everything in that putrid ""Three Musketeers"" remake starring Chris O'Donnell. A lot closer to Alexandre Dumas's original novel is ""The Complete Musketeers,"" a pair of movies that sparkle with humor, romance, swordplay and political plotting. It's a period piece with a wink and nudge.

At the beginning of ""Three Musketeers,"" farm lad D'Artagnan (Michael York) arrives in Paris to try to become one of the king's elite Musketeers. After being challenged to three duels within five minutes, D'Artagnan ends up befriending three of the Musketeers: wry alcoholic Athos (Oliver Reed), naughty priest Aramis (Richard Chamberlain), and lovable fop Porthos (Frank Finlay). Even though D'Artagnan isn't a Musketeer yet, the three Musketeers take a liking to him -- as does his landlord's sexy wife, the queen's lady-in-waiting Constance (Raquel Welch).

However, the evil Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston) is seeking to overthrow the queen, who is having an affair with the Duke of Buckingham. So he arranges for her infidelity to be exposed by a pair of ruthless assassins, Milady de Winter and Comte de Rocheforte (Faye Dunaway and Christopher Lee). But Constance gets D'Artagnan to go to England to retrieve the gems the queen gave the Duke, along with the help of the three Musketeers.

""The Four Musketeers"" is the second half of the original novel, and appropriately called ""Milady's Revenge."" Milady is, unsurprisingly, very peeved that the Musketeers thwarted her in the previous film. So she gets a special pardon ""in advance"" from the Cardinal -- she wants to murder D'Artagnan and Constance, and be unscathed by any punishment.

D'Artagnan sends Constance to a convent, hoping that that will keep her safe. Then, idiotically, he starts an affair with Milady, only to discover the harlot's brand on her shoulder. Milady's machinations spread over the English channel to engulf the Duke of Buckingham. Now only the four Musketeers can hope to bring Milady to justice -- but not before a terrible price is paid.

The art of the action-comedy is pretty much lost -- making action funny. And ""The Complete Musketeers"" is a prime example of that. One good example is the fight with the Cardinal's guards, where Aramis gleefully dodges sword thrusts, and Porthos attacks with rocks and sticks. Another is the scene where the Musketeers use a fake fight to shoplift food.

But the film never quite descends to slapstick, and there is plenty of drama and even tragedy, as one of the important characters dies, and others reveal not-so-pleasant secrets. The sets are outstanding, lavish and full of detail. And the scripting is equally solid, getting across plenty of information in a series of solid one-liners.

All four of the Musketeers are outstanding: York has that naive Luke Skywalker vibe, while Finlay is a lovable hothead, Chamberlin a charming rogue priest, and Reed a tormented soul. Raquel Welch gets to play a fun, comedic character as the clumsy Constance (who, as soon as we see her, falls down the stairs). Heston seems to be relishing the role of a bad guy, and Christopher Lee exudes icy menace as the Comte. Faye Dunaway is also excellent, though she doesn't get to shine until ""Four Musketeers.""

The spirit of Alexandre Dumas seems to live on in the solid, entertaining, tragic, action-filled ""Complete Musketeers."" Just sit back and enjoy the ride.",1095811200,17,3375,5.112522686025408
1193228,5,B000006DAL,"Anchor Bay deserves a great deal of credit for this informative and entertaining double feature of the two classic Musketeer films from the early 1970s.

 Originally planned as one long epic movie (including a then standard intermission in the middle) the decision was made at some point during the production of THE THREE MUSKETEERS that they would either have one four hour movie or two separate movies. Rather than cut out some of the fantastic scenes that had been shot to make the movie more manageable the production company made the more sensible decision to cut the production in two releasing THE THREE MUSKETEER' one year and then THE FOUR MUSKETEERS shortly after.

 Not everyone involved in the production of the movie was happy about the decision. Actress Faye Dunaway publicly stated that (had she known about the splitting of the movie into two) she would have refused to do it since her role in the first was so small. The move led to some litigation and was eventually settled but today movie contracts include what is termed ""The Salkind Clause"" (named after the Salkind's who produced the MUSKETEER movies) to protect actors from such moves.

 It is perhaps for this reason that Faye Dunaway is one of the only still living members of the main cast who does not appear on camera for the excellent hour-long documentary THE SAGA OF THE MUSLETEERS that Anchor Bay has put together for this release.

 Perhaps a deliberate reflection of the movie (or perhaps simply due to limited space on the DVDs) the documentary is split into two half-hour parts on each disc. Recounting their memories of the production are actors Charlton Heston, Raquel Welch, Michael York, Frank Finlay and Christopher Lee who cover nearly every aspect of the production from their casting to some of the close calls and injuries the actors sustained performing their own stunts and swordflighting with real, very lethal swords.

 Lee, himself an expert swordsman, had to remind a rather over enthusiatic Oliver Reed (who abandoned the staged moves for a fight for some more improvised swings) that it was ""only a movie.""

 Also on camera for interviews are producers Ilya Salkind and Pierre Spengler (who would both go on to produce SUPERMAN) who discuss not only the actual production of the movies but also where the initial idea came from and the recruiting of Director Richard Lester. Salkind recounts how Lester initially turned down the invitation to direct the movie, referring to it as ""a children's book"" (as it was seen at the time). It was not until Salkind actually sent him a copy of the actual Alexandre Dumas novel that Lester became excited by the prospect of directing the adaptation.

 With a screenplay by George MacDonald Fraser (of the FLASHMAN novels and later of 1983's OCTOPUSSY) these two movies work remarkably well. Even though there are some surprising stylistic differences (surprising since it was originally meant as one movie). The first movie is definitely more comic in tone and the second darker and more dramatic. This is not to say the second movie is lacking in humor - just witness the Musketeers eating lunch as the prefer for battle with the Protestants.

 Of the two I actually prefer the second movie much more because I feel the characters are more drawn out and the intrigue more involving, The climatic sword fight and Oliver Reed-Faye Dunaway subplot are both highlights in my opinion. The second movie also features the shocking deaths of two of the more likeable major characters.

 Overall, a fantastic job by Anchor Bay. One can only hope that the third movie in the series, 1989's THE RETURN OF THE MUSKETEERS which was also directed by Richard Lester and included the majority of the original cast, will one day be released on DVD.

 Well recommended.",1091145600,90,3795,4.9

1193232,5,B000006DAL,"The Complete Musketeers finally arrives on DVD! This ultimate edition of the classic Lester films are finally given the royal treatment they deserve.  It's a modern take on a classic tale and although there was at least three more films inspired by Dumas' novel (among them the so-so Bratpack version with Keifer Sutherland, and Peter Hyams horrible The Musketeer), these two films (actually shot as one film back-to-back much like Superman  and Superman 2 were to save money).
Presented in the original widescreen aspect ratio, with a nice print (though the picture does occasionally look a bit too soft) and with no edge enhancements, Musketeers is presented in very close to pristine condition. While the sound is a bit dull and flat (not a surprise due to the fact that its a mono recording), I would have preferred to have Lester do a remix to stereo or a 5.1 surround mix (although the elements may be lost so that might not be possible), the soundtrack sounds pretty good given the time (1973)when the film was made and the age of the masters.
Everyone involved gives terrific performances from Michael York to the marvelously underrated Frank Finlay. Richard Chamberlin is at his swashbuckling best. Oliver Reed brings a brooding, dark quality to his performance. Lester's inspired casting of Charleton Heston as the villan was a stroke of genius. Christopher Lee, Rachel Welch and Faye Dunnaway round out a strong international cast.
There are a few flaws. 1) Richard Lester is alive and well and could have provided a very interesting commentary. The question is was he willing or asked to do so? 2) The surviving cast members (York, Dunaway, Chamberlin, Lee and Heston)could have provided an interesting and enlightening commentary. While the documentary is interesting, there's always something missing. Watching the film and commenting on it at the same time usually makes for an interesting and fun time. It's like seeing the film all over again with a fresh set of eyes.
All for one and one for all, this is a marvelous package and Anchor Bay has done a terrific job putting together these two great movies. A 4 star rating for the packaging and a 5 star rating for the the two movies. Well done!",1057881600,14,2211,4.877659574468085

1193245,5,B000006DAL,"When I was growing up in the early '70's, I saw the original theatrical premieres of both Musketeer movies. To a suburban nine year old, there is nothing more rousing then seeing someone shout ""one for all and all for one"" and then go off and kill half the evil Cardinal's guard in a sword fight. But seriously, as a kid I loved these two movies. Now, nearly thirty years later, director Richard Lester's 1973 ""The Three Musketeers and it's sequel, ""The Four Musketeers"" more then hold up as the best film versions of the often told classic, Alex Dumas tale. Richard Lester (director of the classic Beatle's movie ""A Hard Day's Night"")has created two rousing movies that are equal parts humor, pathos and adventure. The well known story moves on at a fast and furious clip without any detriment to the well rounded characters. The movies feature a marvelous 1970's international cast. The young and niave, D'Artagnan is wonderfully played by Michael York. His Musketeer cohorts are also well played with distinct personalties and good characterizations (Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlain and Frank Finlay). Reed is particulary good as the drunken, dark and melancholic musketeer, Athos. On the other side of of the coin is is the cunning and politically motivated, Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston) and his nefarious underlings Rochefort (Christopher Lee) and Milady d'Winter (Faye Dunaway).I mean how can a movie not be great with these three actors as the bad guys???? The story is not treated as some musty old tale from bygone days. The script is very fast, funny and witty. The characters are not wooden with thees and thou's coming out of their mouths. They act like you or I, with many human foibles and for the most part, are motivated by normal needs (such as love, sex, money, and power).Besides some great acting, the films also feature some of the greatest swordplay and stunt work ever put to film. The second film's last sword fight between D'Artagne and Rochefort in a cathedral, keeps my pulse beating hard no matter how many times I've seen it! The two films are now together under the DVD title ""The Complete Musketeers"". The picture and it's remastering is a lot better then previous DVD incarnations. The sound quality is just fair. The extras on the DVD are excellent. Both films feature wonderful documentries, that include participation and comments from many of the actors and production people. For great adventure and comic entertainment, I highly recommend the ""The Complete Musketeers"".",1048550400,17,2516,4.992857142857143
1193246,5,B000006DAL,"I just received my copy of ""The Complete Musketeers"" and, well, what can I say but bravo to Anchor Bay.
The two movies are in the correct 1.77:1 anamorphic aspect ratio of their theatrical release and remixed in Digital Dolby Mono (although, you also have the choice to view both movies in their full-frame format! Important for those with small TV screens).
The anamorphic format has been formatted to fit today's 16x9 TV screens.
Excellent packaging layout, practically spells a Deluxe edition.
The picture quality is sharp and colors are as brilliant as their original theatrical releases, some scenes have actually been visually enhanced.
My only critique to Anchor Bay is, that by naming this collection ""The Complete Musketeers"", they either forgot, or had some licensing problems (having been released by Universal and not by 20th Century-Fox) with the third installment of the filmed classics, called ""The Return of the Musketeers"", which was filmed sixteen years later, in 1989, representing Alexandre Dumas' other classic tale, known as ""Twenty Years Later"" (Vingt Ans Apres).
It is really a pity, since the third installment has the same cast (York, Reed, Finlay and Chamberlain) as the previous two and was also directed by Richard Lester.
This would really have been the ""Complete Musketeers"" collection par excellence.
My only hope is that, since Universal doesn't seem to catch up on their best titles by decently releasing them in their theatrical format on DVD, that at least someone or some Company may buy the rights off their hands and release also this last title (together with other long missing ones) in its appropriate format.
Back to Anchor Bay's version. It is filled with extras.
Two newly filmed documentaries of 25 minutes, for each movie, filled with highly informative interviews and comments by the principal cast and production staff (York, Welch, Chris Lee, Salkind, Finlay, Heston, and and and...).
On the first DVD, they also included the original 7 minute documentary of the Making of ""Three Musketeers"".
All the rest, and on both DVDs, is composed by theatrical trailers, TV Spots, Radio Spots, tons of stills and posters and very detailed bios of the Director and Cast of both movies.
Really remarkable, since I had given up any hope of ever watching these movies resurface in their original theatrical format.
The sound, even though a simple Dolby Digital Mono (remember, both movies were recorded in Mono and as far as I know, there were never stereophonically tracked copies around), but despite this, it is spatially astounding. A very plastic sound, for being Monaural.
This, in my view, is the definitive version of the filmed ""Three Musketeers"". No version before and none thereafter came even close to these two masterpieces.
They are both filled with excellent dialogue, swift and spectacular action (the fencing scenes are still considered the best ever filmed and represent study material) and lots of humor, in the true spirit of Alexandre Dumas.
The cast is stellar to say the least, having reunited the best, England and the United States had to offer at that time. From Michael York to Charlton Heston, from Faye Dunaway to Geraldine Chaplin, including everyone who's everyone in the stage and movie business, such as Christopher Lee, Roy Kinnear, Frank Finlay, Oliver Reed, Raquel Welch and Richard Chamberlain.
This is also a family movie, suitable for all ages and promises a lot of entertainment for all ages.
On to High Adventure then, and don't forget, the Four Musketeers did really exist, maybe not as glamorous as described in books and movies, but they truly walked the Earth and therefore are also part of a history lesson.
If you wish to offer an adventurous movie to your kids, without neglecting a touch of history connected to it, then ""The Complete Musketeers"" is the perfect choice.

Or may I say, All for Two and Two for All?",1044921600,11,3926,5.013782542113323

1193249,5,B000006DAL,"You can tell that the folks at Anchor Bay Entertainment love movies. It shows in every disc they release (like last years wonderful ""MAD MONSTER PARTY"" DVD). And this new release of director Richard Lester's delightfully enjoyable 70's comedy/ swashbuckler's ""THE THREE MUSKETEERS"" and ""THE FOUR MUSKETEERS"" in one 2-disc set is yet another example of their care and love. This is a wonderful release and a superior job over the DVD's Fox-Lorber have had on the market for the last couple of years. No one ever mentioned it (maybe nobody noticed it), but the Fox-Lorber DVD of ""3 MUSKETEERS"" was missing about 1 minute of footage in a scene between Charlton Heston and Christopher Lee. These new discs have the complete versions of both films and they look and sound great! For the first time they are presented in anamorphic widescreen in their proper aspect-ratio (full screen versions are also included but I haven't yet viewed them so I can't comment on them). The extras are also very nice. Two half hour documentaries on each disc includes interviews with stars Raquel Welch, Christopher Lee, Charlton Heston, Michael York and Frank Finlay and producers Ilya Salkind and Pierre Spengler. Trailers, tv spots, radio spots, photo & poster galleries and star biographies (that are actually informative and worth reading) round out this very pleasing package! Buy it, watch it and enjoy!",1044662400,186,1388,5.039130434782609
1193250,5,B000006DAL,"Anchor Bay puts together a fabulous package with this 2 disc set containing the Lester/Salkind films 'The Three Musketeers' and 'The Four Musketeers'.
The first menu option that comes up on the discs is to choose between a 1:77.1 Widescreen version and a Full-Frame version.  Above each menu option on this screen is a Frame Grab which gives one an example of the widescreen vs the full frame.  One does lose a small amount of edge information on the full frame version.  I personally recommend going with the widescreen version, which only gives one very small black bars on the top and bottom, but not enough to be a real distraction to those who hate widescreen presentations.
The quality of the film to DVD transfer is great on both films, in my opinion. The colors are just bright enough. The picture seems quite sharp to me, too, for being 30 years old.  According to the back of the box the films have been '...completely restored from original vault elements...'.  The picture quality on 'The Three Musketeers' is far better than the Fox/Lorber tape I bought about 6 years ago. The transfer on that one seemed to me to be a bit on the dark side.  The audio track is clear, though it won't give your sound system a workout, being in mono, as the original theatrical release was.
The extras are terrific, too.  The first disc has a 23 minute documentary called 'The Saga of the Musketeers'-Part One.  It features new interviews with Ilya Salkind, Michael York, Christopher Lee, Frank Finlay, Charlton Heston, and Raquel Welch, along with a few others that I can't think of. All of them speak very fondly of the experience. It covers the making of 'The Three Musketeers'.  There is also a 7 minute featurette called ""The Making of 'The Three Musketeers'"", which was produced in 1973 and mainly consists of interviews with Richard Lester and Ilya Salkind.  There is also a theatrical trailer, a TV commercial, a number of Radio Advertisements, a poster and still gallery, and bios of cast members.  The second Disc extras consist of a 25 minute documentary 'The Saga of the Musketeers' - Part 2, which is about the making of 'The Four Musketeers'.  The same folks interviewed in Part 1 are interviewed in Part 2.  It also has some nice tributes to Oliver Reed (Athos), Spike Milligan (Constance's Husband) and Roy Kinnear (D'Artagnan's Servant), who have died since the films were made.  The documentary also talks about the fact that the actors were rather angry at the fact that they had been paid to do one 3 1/2 hour epic film and then the Salkinds decided to split it into two films.  In addition to the documentary, there is also a theatrical trailer, a number of TV and Radio commercials, Poster and Still Gallery, and Actor Bios.
I wish that Anchor Bay could have roped some of the cast into doing an audio commentary and that they could have persuaded director Richard Lester to participate in the documentaries or, at least, a commentary.
Stiil, I can't give this package any less than five stars.  Anchor Bay has put together a wonderful package and the films have never looked better.  They are, in my opinion, the most enjoyable version of the Musketeers' story. The casting is perfect.  A splendid blend of action and comedy. They never fail to bring a smile and, at times, fits of laughter to me.
One last note, many people have complained about the fact that this set doesn't include the 1989 sequel to these films, 'The Return of the Musketeers'  I agree that it would have been a great addition to this set.  However, 'The Three Musketeers' and 'The Four Musketeers' are owned by 'Studio Canal' in France, while 'The Return of the Musketeers' is an MCA/Univeral property. Obtaining the rights to 'Return' would probably be a nightmare for Anchor Bay, as I don't think they have distributed any Universal films.  Anchor Bay already has an arrangement for the distribution of Studio Canal's film library in the US.  I don't think the name 'The Complete Musketeers' is misleading.  The set is a complete adaptation of Dumas' 'The Three Musketeers'.  'Return' is an adaptation of another book about the Musketeers, ""Twenty Years After""",1044576000,,4153,4.760111576011157
1193251,4,B000006DAL,"Anchor Bay's re-release of both the 1973 film, The Three Musketeers and the 1974 film, The Four Musketeers, sees an all new packaging of these movies.
Both movies have been remastered and are presented in 1.77:1 Animorphic Widescreen AND 1.33:1 Fullscreen on the same ONE-SIDED disc (one for each movie) via a type of selection typical of choosing a sound track.
For picture quality, if using Widescreen Reviews ratings, I'd give them 4.75/5.0.  The picture is clean with no apparent artifacts or film grain.  Looks about as good for a '73/'74 as you can get.  (This is the oldest movie on DVD I have, BTW)
However, the downfall of this release is that sound is only Dolby Digital MONO.  Thus leaving a lot to be desired for soundstage.  This is surprising since other movies that have had mono soundtracks remixed into DD 5.1.  One such movie was ""The Terminator - SE"" which converted a mono soundtrack into a pretty convincing 5.1 mix.
Spread out over both discs contain a brand new documentary shot in 2002 which includes interviews of some of the actors including Christopher Lee, Charleton Heston, Michael York, and Rachel Welch.  Very interesting to see Rachel in all her 62 years of glory.  She still looks good!  LOL!  But anyway...
If you're interested at all in the ""Three Musketeers"" saga, pick this copy up.  Oh yeah, almost forgot.  The packaging is one of the most attractive 2-disc set I've seen since, well I think ever.  It's a cardboard book-fold type of package with inside flaps that cover the DVDs inside.  On these flaps is a montage of all four Musketeers along with still photos of the films on a blue background.  Open those up and you're presented with a ""3-page"" white background montage of pictures of the secondary characters with the DVDs themselves being as part of the montage. On the 4th page, the far right flap, is a chapter stop list for both films which is written in 17th Century script.  Very attractive packaging overall.
I give the release 4 stars due to the DD Mono soundtrack, but other than that it's a great set of films.",1044230400,3,2066,4.697222222222222
1193252,3,B000006DAL,"Just FYI, the previous reviewer from London commented on the Fox-Lorber releases of ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers"".  I purchased the two movie set as a gift for my brother as we had seen these in the theaters together when we were, well, much younger!  The two movies were the same as the individual copies I purchased seperately for myself.  It is possible that Fox-Lorber has issued another edition of ""The Three Musketeers"" with ""The Four Musketeers"" in Fullscreen, but this edition of ""The Four Musketeers had a slight letterboxing of about 1:66:1, non-anamorphic, yet indeed still seemed virtually identical to full-screen TV/cable editions I have seen.
  For the bargain price I paid for both films I am satisfied and my brother was thrilled to get the set which likewise was very inexpensive.  The retail had been much higher and had I shelled out that much I would also have been unhappy as there are no extras on the Fox-Lorber editions, not even a trailer.  To be fair, I would point out that they were also very early (1997) DVD releases.  However, The two films are being re-released in a new two movie set by Anchor Bay in Feb 2003.  As Anchor Bay has steadily improved their DVD product it should be a nice edition.  I hope, at the very least, it contains the correct Widescreen edition for each film.  Even better would be a dual Widescreen/Fullscreen edition for each film (like their THX edition of Halloween) because I would love to compare the  correct Widescreen and Pan and Scan formats after reading all the interesting reviews here.

1193253,5,B000006DAL,"I first saw Richard Lester's ""The Three Musketeers"" during a very
troubled period in my life (during the film's initial release).  When I walked out of the theatre, I felt at least 10 feet tall--I had experienced one of the great ""uplifts"" of my adult life.
Maybe it was just the emotional circumstances of that particular time, but I have treasured this film ever since.  The absolute perfection of the cast, and the finely balanced direction are the film's chief assets, along with the awesome, detailed AUTHENTICITY of the settings- the costumes, props, and sets.
None of the actors playing the title characters were in the prime of their youth when this film was made, but they are amazingly virile, agile, and powerful in their fight scenes, and
fantastic actors to boot.  Frank Finlay, greatly respected for his ""legit"" theatre work in England, is especially energetic.
(Watch for his double-role as the befuddled jeweler in Buckinham's court).
Simon Ward is breathtakingly regal as the Duke of Buckingham, the amazingly off-beat Spike Milligan is a joy to watch as Raquel Welch's buffoonish husband, Christopher Lee is a terrifying presence as Rochefort, and Roy Kinnear, another fine
actor and comedian, is an engaging Planchet.  And the internationally renowned cast goes on and on!  Welch, York, Dunaway, Heston, Chaplin, the Frenchmen Cassel and Georges Wilson....
And the action!  Imaginatively designed and superbly staged---
swordfights in a convent courtyard, a laundry, a tavern, near a huge water-wheel, etc----all of these settings beautifully intergrated into the plot.  This is a harsh, gritty world full of blood, sweat, mud----the Musketeers are not supernatural creatures, but very real men who grunt and gasp under the strain of hand-to-hand combat.
But, after one particluarly vigorous fight is concluded, the first line we hear is Porthos' ""My hair...!""  Yes, Richard Lester's wacky sense of humor pervades the entire film, balancing witty asides along with the visceral intensity of this violent and dangerous period in history.
Finally---the music---one of the great soundtracks of all time, and that's NOT an overstatement.  Michel Legrand's score is one of power, briliance, and, in spots, an unearthly sort of beauty, combining elements of authentic Renaissance music with his own
robust and sensuous style.  The fight in the inn underscore is
a true gem, and the music for the final scene in the sunlit courtyard (when heard in its entirety on the soundtrack recording) is nearly overwhelming, and really takes me back to the dynamic experience of my first encounter with this film in April of 1974.
It's a pity that ""The Four Musketeers"" is such an incredible emotional downer---but the unbridled joy and rousing spirits of ""The Three Musketeers"" is something that I will always treasure.",1041984000,4,2821,5.221238938053097
1193264,4,B000006DAL,"Don't listen to the reviewers who say these films are faithful to the book. I am reading the book right now and while there are a lot of similarities these films ARE NOT faithful to the book!
The comedic aspect of these films is way over the top and is not so extreme in the book. Aramis is a different character and D'Artagnan and Constance are not so damn silly!
Anyway that having been said these are still great films!
Excellent casting of our favorite swashbucklers and very funny.
It would be nice to have the third film out as well even if it doesn't measure up to the first two as well.
If you want other interesting versions check out The Man In The Iron Mask with Jeremy Irons, Gabriel Burn etc... not a bad film and the Disney Three Musketeers, while also a severe departure from the book is very funny and the ages of the actors are actually closer to the ages of the characters in the book.

Of all the movies based on Dumas' Musketeers, these two are, by far, the best.  Maybe not by today's special effects standards, but for excellent storytelling and cinematography.

1193267,4,B000006DAL,"I would just like to add a footnote to the DVD aspect ratio observations made by other contributors shown here. It appears that the first DVD `The Three Musketeers' has been originally taken from a full screen (1.33:1) high quality digitised master used for international television broadcast. The second film `The Four Musketeers' does not appear to have a digitised master and so has been taken from a decent, though nowhere near as good, a print of the French version that has had the original English dialogue put back with some syncing problems. This second DVD has been made semi-letterbox (1.66:1) with full image height but some loss of picture to the sides.
In an attempt to make both films of this set  appear similar Fox Lorber have taken the dubious decision to cut off the top and bottom of the image of the first film to match the black bars of the second. You can verify the cut off by comparing the opening credits of `The Four Musketeers' with the key scenes from the first film that it reprises.
At the time of writing (September 2002) amazon.com appears to have for sale a newer (February 2001 release) full screen version of both films separately on DVD, again through Fox Lober (according to the amazon.com technical information -if you buy it would you please add a review to confirm this is correct). The customer reviews made here and elsewhere may have led to FL's change of heart. I presume the first film to be taken from the same digital master but with the daft cut offs removed and guess the second has more removed from the sides to fill the screen top and bottom. So if you have the cash and want the best possible versions of both films it seems you will have to buy both this first films single DVD and the set to use the second DVD! This may seem steep (too steep for me as I have to add UK delivery) but its the only way to get maximum image. You may also care to know that the customers reviews to the single DVD's are different from those shown here so you may like to read them also; so long as they are still available on amazon.com. that is.
I would not advise waiting for better versions to become available as they may never appear. Marvellous as these films are, (and the reviews here confirm) the fact that Fox Lorber have not released either `The Return of the Musketeers' or an earlier offshoot `The Prince and the Pauper' on DVD and have only released these first two films as region 0 DVD's indicates that the apparent market for these classics is made up of a small but enthusiastic bunch that is unlikely to grow with time. Hence I suggest you get these flawed transcriptions while they are available rather than live in hope.
P.S. I was surprised no one else has mentioned the score to `The Three Musketeers' by Michael Legrand. I have the L.P. Album of this and its great fun; far better than the workmanlike but uninspiring score to `The Four Musketeers' by Lalo Schifrin. You can tell precisely how good it is by the fact that it keeps on popping up in TV and radio adverts to this day. Especially the short recorders & strings theme to D'Artagnan's seduction of Constance. It starts as a simple woodwind chant, spills into the pastoral and builds to a gloriously overblown thousand stringed wave of emotion.",1032220800,7,3263,4.530508474576271

1193272,5,B000006DAL,"This film, aside from being one of the most faithful and best cast versions of the Musketeers story by Dumas I can remember seeing, is a Rembrandt painting that moves! With VERY faithful costuming and better than average cinematography, there is also a realism and wit to it that few previous versions had. The only standout as a concession to Hollywood thinking in the cast is plastic Richard Chamberlain as Aramis, kind of a peripheral character to begin with. Another criticism is a blasphemous throwaway scene involving a mental case with a smudge pot on his head in the middle of the film.

The actor to watch in this film is Oliver Reed, whose Athos is the center of the film and the small Musketeer band that is the center of the story itself. The rest of the cast is a quintessential 70's A-list of actors: Faye Dunaway, still hot as a pistol after ""Bonnie & Clyde"" and ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" plays the scheming Lady De Winter; Raquel Welch, in what is her best movie to date, plays a bumbling Constance Boniceur; Simon Ward, two years off of ""Young Winston"" plays the Duke of Buckingham; Michael York, whose ""Murder On The Orient Express"" and ""Logan's Run"" made him a semi-superstar along with this movie, plays the young d'Artagnan; Frank Finlay, an obscure actor who nonetheless lets his hamminess make for an enjoyably vain Porthos; Charlton Heston as Cardinal Richilieu, (good casting,); Geraldine Chaplin, (Charlie's daughter,) as Queen Anne; Christopher Lee as Rocheforte and Richard Lester's trademark repertoire man, Roy Kinnear, as Blanchet. They all come together to make a movie, (split into two for length,) that is without a doubt the best version of this story in wide release in the last forty years. At least that I'VE ever seen!

Oliver Reed's Athos is parlayed perfectly....Reed really seems to get into the period mindset and the character's ""elder statesmen"" cast, taking d'Artagnan under his wing, reveling in the spirit and fun of the role as the band's ""wise man"", and probably doing the most furious fighting of all the actors. Michael York is also perfect as d'Artagnan, having just the right attitude of semi-reckless adeptness as the young Gascon. Welch comes off a bit like a bubblehead in her role of Constance Boniceur, but she was STILL a knockout! Dunaway gives us a hint of what her ""Network"" oscar-winning role will be like as the vicious Lady De Winter, a former paramour of Athos, and a future paramour of the callow d'Artagnan. Christopher Lee is in what is probably HIS best role to date as Rocheforte, Cardinal Richilieu's OWN man Friday.

For some reason, only Blanchet is represented of the Musketeer manservants, although, in the Dumas original, ALL the fellows had assistants that followed them through 2/3 of the story. Athos' attach, Grimaud, AAMOF, had more story time than Blanchet, but there you have it. The Gene Kelly version of this story, (well photographed but laughable,) did the same thing, excluding ALL the other right-hand men except d'Artagnan's! Lester is obviously following this predecessor's lead, but that is the ONLY lead he follows in this movie!

Kinnear plays Blanchet comically, pretty much like he played Victor Spinetti's assistant in ""Help!""

This film has been hard to trace down for home video before this because it has been bandied about among a handful of obscure video releasing companies, but there's no way masterpieces like this could be lost forever. Snap it up before it disappears again!!",1016928000,,3484,4.938566552901024

7904063,5,B000006DAL,This was the first Musketeer movie I saw after reading ALL of the books. These two movies do a really great job of covering The Three Musketeers. Dick Lester handled the major plot points and managed to keep a lot of the bits that are generally not covered in movies. I understood he actually had 6 hours of film but had to cut it down to these two. I mourn for what was left out! Wish there was a directors cut with all of it.,1516320000,2,427,4.035294117647059
