8274998,3,B0019QPWSY,Got this for my mom she likes this guy.... there are a lot of skit things mixed in would have preferred it be straight up stand up comedy. Not horrible but not what we expected.,1507075200,,177,4.085714285714285
8274999,5,B0019QPWSY,David is one of the best ventriloquist I have seen and very funny.  I couldn't stop laughing...  Not sure the too short review as this has the TV show episode as well as the full program which is excellent and over an hour long.  I highly recommend this video.,1377993600,,260,4.26530612244898
8275000,3,B0019QPWSY,This is quite funny but WAY too short.  Wouldn't buy another one for this price.,1260835200,,80,4.333333333333333
