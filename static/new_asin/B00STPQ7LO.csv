8699227,5,B00STPQ7LO,Moments from the life of a beautiful young woman who lived way more fully and wholeheartedly with a relentlessly aggressive disease than many will ever do who have a relatively healthy body.  The love and commitment shown by her parents to care for her and help her reach for her dreams is steadfast and touching.

8699232,4,B00STPQ7LO,"I watched this because a friend whose daughter has EB recommended it highly. So there were parts I knew--the hours-daily skincare regimen, the ongoing pain, that something as simple as eating can cause blistering and the esophagus to close up. But even after knowing her for 16 years and seeing the unbelievable daily regimen involved for basic skin care, I learned a lot about the disease I didn't know. It's well filmed and has good background music provided by the dad, who's a musician, but mainly it's just a candid and moving insight into the disease, trying to live a normal life with it, other people's reactions (good and bad), and how it affects the whole family.",1433721600,,673,4.760683760683761
