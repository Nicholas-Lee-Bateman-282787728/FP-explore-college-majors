The other review on here says the customer didn't even get the right movie. If Valerian has anything to do with Buzu, your disgraceful customer service and pricing doesn't surprise me at all you theiving SOB. It's a great story told by the guys who lived it as soon as they came home from it, but it's not a $90 DVD. Unless you're one of the guys or the family of one of the fallen or maybe a loved one of one of the guys who've fallen since production. Buzu, maybe you don't care about ripping off Vets and Gold Star families, but my name is on this film. These are my brothers and this is their story. It's a $20 DVD at most. You should fix yourself.",1473120000,,821,4.012195121951219
8146322,1,B000ILZ6KK,"I bought three different, new DVDs and it does not have ""Make Peace or Die"" on it.  It has a Marilyn Monroe documentary.  Very strange.

I pointed this out to Amazon and did not get any answer.  Too bad because I would really like to see ""Make Peace or Die"".",1170720000,9,258,4.1
