6258625,5,B00ID3TPA2,"One of the greatest television shows of the 80's, in one of its, if not thee finest season of the entire run, in one simple package.",1434758400,2,132,4.115384615384615

6258628,5,B00ID3TPA2,I watched both the movie and the series and Don Johnson made a better Crockett.,1432166400,,79,4.333333333333333
6258629,5,B00ID3TPA2,"I have the old DVDs with 3 double sided discs.  Before Law and Order, there was Miami Vice.
I started watching this when the TV Land Channel showed a marathon of several
episodes and I was hooked.  Got the first two seasons at my local Circuit City store.
Here we meet Sonny, Rico, Switek, Zito, Gina and Trudy,  Lou Rodriguez was the
original boss of the Vice Squad until Lt. Martin Castillo came in the ninth episode (One
Eyed Jack).  This first season set features five documentaries on the show - behind
the scenes, the style of Miami Vice, the music heard on the show, the show's role
in changing television, and Miami after the show ended.  I would have liked if whoever
had put these sets together to include a booklet (even of pictures of cast members or
trivia) and I wish that they had summaries of each episodes like they do in the later three
seasons.  Must watch!

Favorite episodes - Golden Triangle, Pilot, Heart of Darkness, Calderone's Return, One Eyed
Jack, Evan, No Exit, Lombard.",1431129600,,999,4.578651685393258
6258630,5,B00ID3TPA2,"The show is awesome to this day and this season is one of the best, and the DVD production quality is good.  When I bought this on Amazon the price was far less than the current $32, though.  I could see myself paying that much or even more if Miami Vice was remastered in 720p or higher, and with updated extra content with more focus on the cast.",1411344000,9,348,4.102941176470588
6258631,4,B00ID3TPA2,"This is NEW ? Product had 2 disc's with several scratches,damages make it impossible for new. Still this seminal series a must see for all.
This is the great writer director Michael Mann's television foray into undercover cops in Miami drug scene of the 80,s. Introduces James
Edward Olmos in his award wining role.",1409356800,2,315,4.851851851851852
6258632,5,B00ID3TPA2,Purchased for hubby Bday. He was stationed overseas when this was a hit in the states and never got to see many episodes. He loves it and watched all episodes in a matter of days. Great gift for someone who remembers the 80's. Good story lines but we also enjoy laughing at things we recall from the era.,1408838400,6,304,4.258620689655173
6258633,3,B00ID3TPA2,"One of my favourite 80'S TV series MIAMI VICE has been re-issued on DVD again
This time by Mill creek entertainment, i read on TVshowsondvd.com/news/miami-vice
that Mill creek have gained the copyrights to season 1 & 2 of Miami vice from Universal
and this time apparently Mill creek have newly remastered all the episodes from season 1 & 2 in High Definition,
which i find hard to believe how can you put HD transfers
on DVD Discs which is completely different format to Blu-ray quality
tragically that's all Mill creek have done with season 1 & 2, there are no Bonus features at all from season 1 Universal dvd
all you get is new upgraded transfers for both seasons the sound quality is the same 5.1 dolby surround
so each episode is suppose to look more sharp & clearer than the old Digital remaster transfers from the Universal dvd versions
Mill creek's packaging of both seasons is terrible in my opinion
Mill creek has 6 episodes on each Disc, 4 Discs in total all packed on top of each other in black rectangle plastic case
where is the Universal dvd has 6 Discs, 4 episodes on each Disc on Flip trays inside plastic clamshell case
which is the 2014 reissue the other versions before were fold out Dig-pak's with 2 sided Discs
so if your not concerned about the packaging & also no extras from the Universal season 1 dvd set
but you want much better picture quality in 1:33:1 close to HD as your going to get
then buy the Mill creek dvd's of season 1 & 2
otherwise just keep your own copies of the Universal seasons 1 & 2 dvd's
2-3 stars for the Mill creek dvd's based on supposely new High definition remastered episodes
but none of the extras from season 1 universal dvd have been carried over",1406160000,28,1702,4.458333333333333
6258634,5,B00ID3TPA2,"The music! The cars! The clothes! The hair! The first season of Miami Vice had it all. The first season also has a cheerful, tongue-in-cheek spirit that quickly got lost as the show became popular and started taking itself too seriously.

6258640,5,B00ID3TPA2,"This new DVD Mill Creek edition boasts the best picture quality I have ever seen of Miami Vice. They have a Complete Series Blu Ray box set available soon and I'm sort of kicking myself because I could have waited for that version for even better picture quality. However, I have a newer blu ray player and with the upconversion the HD transfers look pretty damm good. Sound is good, I'm hearing all those classic songs but I don't have a list of anything that has been edited. Good job",1472860800,,486,4.411111111111111

6258644,1,B00ID3TPA2,The mill creek version of the first season is missing episodes and it seems that the violence has been cut from unrated to a kindergarten version. Buy the universal version of season one and two. Also the mill creek box set has double sided disc's and I had trouble playing them. I bought the universal version and had no problems playing all the disc's.,1468281600,,354,4.546875
6258645,5,B00ID3TPA2,"The greatest TV SERIES ever.  Ushered in a whole era of sartorial elegance.  Every man wanted to be Sonny Crockett.  Every woman wanted him.

The tunes of Phil Collins and Glenn Frey playing in the background.  ICONIC!  Long live ELVIS the pet alligator.",1466812800,,415,5.119402985074627
6258646,5,B00ID3TPA2,"As a kid I could not comprehend the incidents in Miami that influenced this show.  Im kicking myself for not taking an interest in Miami Vice when I was sixteen years old.  The style, themes and music makes Miami Vice one of those mid-range classic shows, I cant put it up there with M.A.S.H., Sopranos,  GOT or The Wire , yet it is memorable.  Well, Season 1 is memorable.",1465948800,,373,4.36231884057971
6258647,3,B00ID3TPA2,"Mill Creek Entertainment reissued the first two seasons of  Miami Vice on DVD in May 2016, the picture quality is remastered and improved compared to the earlier Universal releases (2005, 2014). The dirt and scratch has been noticeably cleaned up, the picture is not as dark, looks sharper, definite improvement, this is based on comparison of the Pilot episode between Mill Creek's 2016 Region 1 NTSC reissue and Region 2-4 PAL Australian release from 2008 by Universal. The Mill Creek source apparently comes from new HD remasters, too bad they are not pressed on Blu-Ray discs.
The new DVD sets are priced really cheap, $14.99 suggested retail and half off on Amazon. All episodes are on just 4 DVD discs (as opposed to six discs for Universal's single-sided reissues a few years ago or even fewer episodes per disc on 2008 R2 release which had 8 discs) which has to affect overall picture quality but not noticeable to me. The MillCreek Disc 1 has the Pilot (not the two-part version as on the Region 2 release but as single movie of 1 hour 37 mins), and episodes 2 (48:45), 3 (48:46), 4 (48:53), 5 (47:42), all on Disc 1. That's six episodes on one disc! (One of the four discs has just 5 episodes, all others six!) The Mill Creek DVD  does not have the 20 secs Universal intro/logo at the beginning of each episode, otherwise they seem to be identical episodes. I have compared episodes between Mill Creek 2016 release and Universal Region 1 2014 reissue (Disc One was not present in my set):
Pilot: 1:36:43 (2016)
Heart of Darkness: 48:44 (2016)
Cool Runnin': 49:01 (2014), 48:46 (2016)
Calderone's Return:Part 1: 49:02 (2014), 48:53 (2016)
Calderone's Return: Part 2: 47:56 (2014), 47:42 (2016)
One Eyed Jack: 48:58 (2014), 48:47 (2016)
No Exit: 49:03 (2014), 48:50 (2016)
The Great McCarthy: 49:04 (2014), 48:48 (2016)
Glades: 48:28 (2014), 47:45 (2016): 40 secs difference here could be significant
Give a Little, Take a Little: 48:42 (2014), 48:31 (2016)
Little Prince: 48:23 (2014), 48:10 (2016)
Milk Run: 48:58 (2014), 48:45 (2016)
Golden Triangle Part 1: 48:30 (2014), 48:17 (2016)
Golden Triangle Part 2: 48:35 (2014), 48:20 (2016)
Smuggler's Blues: 49:00 (2014), 48:51 (2016)
Rites of Passage: 49:01 (2014), 48:47 (2016)
The Maze: 48:58 (2014), 48:47 (2016)
Made For Each Other: 48:57 (2014), 48:46 (2016)
The Home Invaders: 49:18 (2014), 49:07 (2016)
Nobody Lives Forever: 49:02 (2014), 48:51 (2016)
Evan: 48:58 (2014), 48:41 (2016)
Lombard: 49:02 (2014), 48:48 (2016)
Audio on 2016 release: 5.1 Dolby Digital and 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo, no additional languages. The 5.1 has a problem on Episode 2 in several scenes when the audio sounds echoed, the Dolby Digital Stereo is fine.
There is no booklet, all 4 discs are on top of each other in a regular DVD case.
The biggest problem is that there are no subtitles for this 2016 reissue and also no bonus features, the ones from Universal's Season 1 sets were not ported over but they weren't that essential anyway, yet some bonus features would have been nice. The 2014 reissue had English, French, Spanish subtitles and I think all Universal season sets have at least English subtitles.
I recently also purchased the Universal single sided disc reissue from 2014, which had duplicated Disc Six, just hope someone will get this Season 1 release right someday: on Blu Ray, with subtitles, better Bonus features, no audio issues, all discs present, I am hoping!",1463270400,17,3426,4.92560553633218

6258653,5,B00ID3TPA2,"The absolute best season of a legendary show. Each episode was its own motion picture. There was nothing small about this show. You had the clothes, the cars, the boats, the women, the future stars, the incredible Miami landscape, etc.. The writing was topnotch and the acting was superb. If there is one knock on season one, it is maybe that the season was too good. Not going to lie, everybody associated with this show got a big head after season one. Season 2 was a huge downward slide compared to season 1, too self congratulatory. Season 1 highlights, ""Evan,"" ""Cool Running,"" ""No Way Out,"" ""Glades,"" ahh heck, it was a strong season from start to finish.

6258660,4,B00ID3TPA2,"Good series, but not as good as I remembered. Tv wasn't as deep and detailed back then as it is now and didn't carry the characters beyond each episode.
