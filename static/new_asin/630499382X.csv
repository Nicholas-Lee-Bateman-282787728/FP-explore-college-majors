8194095,1,630499382X,"I actually attended one of Guy Magar's (the director of this film) filmmaking seminars and this was the main work he referred to throughout the class. I thought the storyline was very predictable and the characters very flat. However, the film was a good reflection of Guy's personality -- It was sloppy and completely filled with profanity. This film was one that need not have ever been made and it's one that you need not see.

Don't waste 90 minutes of your life on this one.",1093219200,5,479,4.569767441860465
8194096,4,630499382X,"I watched this film with an open mind having seen LeBlanc in Friends & Lost in Space. I was very pleasantly suprised to see what a talented actor he actually is. He showed a full range of acting skills & made the  character of Anthony appealing, he could have failed & just made him  obnoxius. The plot is good, characters strong & the film enjoyable.  Glad I bought it.",944870400,10,370,4.333333333333333
