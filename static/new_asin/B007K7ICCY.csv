5092265,5,B007K7ICCY,"Todd Rundgren has given us so many works of heart,soul and genius. This album was so far ahead of it's time. The subject of the album,well it wasn't what the rest of the kids were playing,thank God for that. I came in on the Something/ Anything album in 72 so I've been listening to Todd for a long time. This concert is even better sounding than the album. But then he has some of the best musicians playing with him. The album was originaly done by Todd alone,as were many of his solo albums. The playing singing and video production all exellent. The young choir so wonderful all of them. Buy this and the Todd dvd also, both superb. I saw the first Utopia album tour live in Chicago in 74 so this completes my favs, Todd,1st Utopia,Healing. To put the icing on the cake, the Roy Firestone interviews,pt1 on the Todd dvd, pt2 on Healing,they are very definitive. The audience is polite and is pretty quiet, but I've never met any rude people at a Todd show.",1354838400,,960,4.398876404494382
5092266,5,B007K7ICCY,"This copy is excellent.. The camera work is great, as with the first half of the show (Todd - Which you can purchase here too)... Very Fast Shipping!!  Thank You  :-)",1354752000,,166,4.32258064516129
5092267,5,B007K7ICCY,"Todd has been doing concerts of his old albums, but this is by far the best album and concert. I flew from CA to OH to see the concert because I missed it when it was closer and it was well worth it. The recording helps me relive it. It is close to my heart - I played this album as I was birthing our first son. But it also brings me back to that young idealistic time when everything was possible. Not that it isn't now - but I hope you understand the 'magic' I am referring to.",1354406400,,480,3.8585858585858586
5092268,5,B007K7ICCY,"I will admit that although I have been a Huge Todd Rundgren Fan for about 37 years now, ""Healing"" had never struck me as being one of his better works. I tend to gravitate more towards Todd's Heavy Guitar work.
After purchasing ""Todd"" DVD and being totally blown away, I was very curious about this ""Healing"" basically being the 2nd set.
I very much enjoyed it the first time I watched it. Although Todd only straps the Guitar on twice, he definitely makes it scream during the frenzied ending of ""Shine"". This DVD and concert is not about Todd's Guitar playing or mastery, you got that with the first set!
This is Todd's Heart being worn on his sleeve for all to see, hear and feel!
I watched it last night for the second time (as a follow up to hearing Neil Young & Crazy Horses- ""Psychedelic Pill"" for the first time)and it hit me hard.
The Music and the Spirit of this DVD is encompassing. You are moved about the stage by the cameramen to the places where things are happening...Whether it is Musical, or Vocal or the amazing rapport with the audience YOU are there if you allow yourself to be!
Unexpectedly during the final song, ""Sons of 1984"" I burst into tears. This doesn't happen with me. I haven't cried in a long while! It felt good. The Tears were Healing Tears of Joy. The emotions came out through the Band into my Soul and created sheer Magic.
God Bless You Always Mr. Todd. You are a Healer and made me Realize that I am too!",1351987200,10,1443,4.368029739776952
5092269,5,B007K7ICCY,"This is the best music DVD I have seen in years.  You would be crazy not to buy it.  If you like rock, it's good, if you like harmony, its good, it you like spiritual, its good.  Take my advice, this one will be a valued part of your collection.",1344988800,7,245,3.86
5092270,5,B007K7ICCY,"This had a lot to live up to for me. Healing is my favourite Todd album of all. It Is in my opinion his most personal and most philosophical and congruent work. It oozes good karma and a made a real spiritual connection for me from the first time I heard it. My hopes were more than realised. This is a work of sheer brilliance. Todd gives one of his most powerful and moving performances of all time. His vocals are beautiful and reach  a searing intensity. The performance captures the majesty and spiritual essence of this unique album. The other vocalists and musicians all aquit themselves brilliantly and Bobby Strickland particularly stands out with his saxophone  solo and flute playing. Todd s vocals are superb and they are beautifully complimented by the fine choir. Their beautiful voices, youthful good looks and the passion they display for the music under the masterful direction of Dirk Hillyer is sublimely moving and it adds an extra dimension to the music. The audience are also totally engaged with the performance and that adds to the feeling that you are watching something g truly special. From a technical viewpoint too, the quality is excellent with a very clear picture and lots of good camera angles.
If you love Todds music and especially if you have a love and a spiritual affinity with this record then you will find that this DvD adds new dimensions to your relationship with this trully wonderful record.
Highly recommended - and don't miss the second half of Emmy winner Roy Firestones insightful, no punches pulled interview with Todd.",1342915200,19,1569,4.828996282527881
5092271,5,B007K7ICCY,"I had the great privilege of seeing the ""Todd / Healing"" tour last year in Hartford, CT. After seeing TR in concert at least a dozen times prior (going back nearly 30 years), I can safely say that this was the finest set I've ever seen him deliver. No small thanks to the material; 1974's ""Todd"" double LP was, in my mind, the zenith of Todd's explosive creativity, though the (musically and thematically) new-age concepts found in 1981's ""Healing"" are no less innovative or compelling. The two distinct periods contrast each other, within the one concert, with seriously satisfying results.

Todd made the decision to split off the two halves of the show into 2 separate DVDs, but each one is well worth the coin. Most of this material is not available on any other video format, and much of it has never seen live performance, prior to this tour. Most of the material from the ""Todd"" record couldn't be replicated on stage, in its time, before the advent of easy, on-stage sample-triggering that we see today. The ""Todd"" DVD half was released a few months back.

So, on to this DVD. What can I say? The quality of this recording is beautiful. A full complement of multiple, HD camera angles capture every aspect of the performance. The sound is fantastic, although Todd's vocal could have been a little higher in the mix. At times, when the choir is at full-tilt, they drown out TR's voice. A shame, too, because Todd's voice is in RARE form on this one. ""Healing"" is a real showcase album for Todd's sensitive vocal side, and he didn't miss a thing with this performance. Truly impressive. The high-school choir that backs Todd up on this show do an admirable job. Not the best, by any stretch, but the juxtaposition of their youth with the elder statesman's show of conviction sets the tone for many of the album's themes of birth / death / rebirth; the cyclic nature of the universe and its karmic energy. It was really uplifting to see some of these kids' faces, during quiet passages of profound lyrical depth that the MAN delivers. It seemed to mean something to them. Musically, the band does not disappoint, either. Todd picks his people well, and there isn't a guy on stage that isn't a seasoned multi-instrumentalist. Any one of Todd's stable can pick up a bass, guitar or keyboard and just go. Reliable Kas, Tubes drummer Prairie Prince and The Cars keyboardist Greg Hawkes; guitarist Jesse Gress and reed-man Bobby Strickland round out the tight, ambient performance.

I'd love it if Todd would re-mix the album, sans vocals. Granted, the lyrical / vocal component of the piece is crucial, but seeing it live (both on stage, and on this DVD) obliges me to focus on the complexities of the composition and arrangement that are 50% of what make ""Healing"" such a masterpiece.

Hard to believe one man could have done it alone. But easy to believe, if that one man is TODD.

Five Stars.",1340150400,34,2896,4.670588235294118

5092297,4,B007K7ICCY,"I don't know how Todd keeps the enthusiasm at such a high level, but he does. It does not always come through, but the majority of this performance is inspired and emotional. Overall, very well done and recorded. The video would be better in HD, naturally, but I was not distracted by the quality. If you a re a Todd fan and liked the album ""Healing"", this is right in your wheelhouse. Good stuff!",1409529600,,397,4.378378378378378

5092299,5,B007K7ICCY,"Timely and in great condition. As to content, I had been eagerly awaiting it, and although I don't always get off on the costuming, it was aweinspiring to see a flawless live production of this work, one of his best (aren't they all?)",1399248000,,234,4.465116279069767
5092300,5,B007K7ICCY,"I'm not a big fan of live videos, but this one is fantastic.  I've been listening to it on YouTube for the last month and I thought it was so good that I just had to get the DVD.  Good thing I did too, because it's since been taken down from YouTube.  The studio album for HEALING is good, but the live material comes off much better.  And the teen chorus they got to sing on stage just adds to it all.  I wish Todd would put out more of his material in new live performances, like with the Amsterdam Metropole.  I'd love to be able to buy a CD or 2 CD set of their 2012 and 2011 performances.  The music benefits immeasurably from having the orchestra with Todd.",1392681600,2,663,4.053846153846154

5092303,5,B007K7ICCY,"The DVD ""Todd"" and this DVD ""Healing"" were BOTH recorded on Sept 14, 2010. It was one show divided into 2 separate products. Both are really great additions to any Todd Rundgren fan's library.

A few questions though:

The ""Todd"" DVD has a stereo mix PLUS a 5.1 mix. The ""Healing"" DVD only has a stereo mix. Why?

The artwork on the Healing DVD I bought from Amazon has a different cover than what's shown here. Why?
(My DVD cover has the same photo that is used on the audio CD of this concert.)
And by the way, my DVD does not appear to be a bootleg...both are made by ""Smore Entertainment"".

I sent an e-mail about this to Todd's website store....got ignored.

DOES anyone out there have a DVD of this that DOES contain the 5.1 audio?

Just curious.",1372118400,,752,4.335714285714285
5092304,2,B007K7ICCY,This still seems like TR is living out some kind of mythological way back machine. The different costumes and the music performd from his Healing album is something you either like of don't. I didn't....,1370476800,2,203,4.828571428571428
5092315,5,B007K7ICCY,Todd at his best with a great band and a choir. You won't be dissatisfied with this DVD. Todd performs an extremely complex album very well.,1369008000,,140,4.423076923076923
5092316,5,B007K7ICCY,"If you follow Todd Rundgren's career, you know he released Healing  in the seventies. Todd, over the last few years ,has been playing some of his classic lps in their entirety live. This Is a recording of one of those performances. All the elements of the record are there. You now get the joy of watching the concert time and again.if you buy it. Also included is part two of a lengthy interview Todd did to a small group of people. Part one of this interview is on the TODD concert DVD which was released by the same DVD company. If you crave facts about Todd's career and life, this interview will provide answers. So you get a recording of a live performance, plus 1/2 of a 3 hour interview for the price of purchase.",1369008000,2,721,4.340740740740741
5092317,5,B007K7ICCY,"Loved the Todd healing album when it was first released. Seeing him perform this 30 odd years later live was a breath of fresh air. I would have loved to have been at that concert more than anything, but living in Australia makes it hard to attend his concerts.  Todd is touring Oz in July this year though, so very much looking forward to that.",1363824000,,345,4.3076923076923075
5092318,5,B007K7ICCY,The music is meditative and masterful.  The visual effects of the stage and costumes are soothing and beautiful.  I love the way Todd brought the young fresh faces and voices on stage to enhance the messages of these songs.  This is a magical DVD.,1363651200,,247,4.568181818181818
5092319,5,B007K7ICCY,"Fantastic production, with part 2 of the excellent interview that began on the DVD of the first half of this show, which was the performance of the Todd album.  The interview alone is worth the price; the show is like the icing on the cake!",1361750400,,240,4.333333333333333
5092320,3,B007K7ICCY,Not as fun as Todd but still a good performance there. Great interview with Roy Firestone as well.  Its almost a meditation.in concert.,1359244800,,135,4.869565217391305
5092321,5,B007K7ICCY,What can you Say its a concert you always wished to see ( and I seen the sows back then and he never played the full album) But to see it and hear it the way it was on the LP is great.  The band is right on and the sounds from the keyboards and synths are the same as they were back in 1980s when the LP was released. this is one of a series and all of them are good. I like the interviews at the end as you get to learn a lot about Todd career and why some things happened in his life.,1358985600,,486,3.542056074766355
5092322,5,B007K7ICCY,Don't miss out of this one.  Todd and company at their best - it's a thrill to see HEALING performed live!,1357516800,,106,4.0476190476190474
5092323,5,B007K7ICCY,Dont really have to say more than just TODD! An under recognized pop contemporary musical genius performs the healing album live. Great musicianship and a enjoyable interview segment,1357430400,,182,5.535714285714286
5092324,5,B007K7ICCY,A fabulous DVD. It was greazt to see it again as I was in the audience for the filming of the show.,1355529600,,99,3.5454545454545454
8518680,5,B007K7ICCY,"I bought Healing and Todd to relive the show I attended. What I discovered as a bonus was a THREE HOUR interview with Todd done by Roy Firestone who worked his butt off to make it a GREAT interview. So do yourself a favor and buy TODD and HEALING and then watch Todd, then part one of the interview. Change discs and watch part two of the interview before you delve into Healing. You will not be disappointed.",1529798400,,409,4.256410256410256
8518681,5,B007K7ICCY,"For Todd fans, this was truly sublime!  Fascinating interview with Roy Firestone; Todd answered questions with candor.  The music was great--Healing was my favorite Todd album back in the day (along with the album called Todd); he really is, still, a master of all things musical.  The haunting melodies stick in the head (and watching him do those albums, in song order, is pure fun!).",1487548800,,386,4.907692307692308
8518682,5,B007K7ICCY,Bought it as a present. He loved it!,1472947200,,36,3.625
8518683,4,B007K7ICCY,"The band did great.  The chorale is a bit amateur, but young and quite endearing to match this spiritual concert.  I think this would be accessible to a wide audience, and refreshing.",1455494400,,183,4.6875
8518684,5,B007K7ICCY,"As a long time Todd fan, there is, admittedly, a certain degree of bias regarding my appreciation of Todd's work. Regarding the performances, they are exactly what you would expect from Todd, which is as close to perfection as possible in a live environment. The band is comprised of former band members and key musicians from Todd's various group incarnations and the songs, in my opinion, are finally brought to life in a way that only a live performance can deliver. If you are contemplating purchasing this concert then there are a couple of things to consider: 1) Are you familiar with the studio album ""Healing""? 2) Are you interested in watching the second part of a 3 hour interview with Todd and Roy Firestone? If you want the complete package, then buy the ""Todd"" concert when you purchase this one. Both shows were performed on the same day, with the same band, and part One of the interview with Todd is on the ""Todd"" concert, whereas part Two of the interview is on the ""Healing"" concert. The lineup of musicians is the same for both shows and the performances will delight you beyond anything you could imagine by merely listening to the studio albums. The point is that these concerts bring the full blown edition of both studio albums to life including all of the silly Rundgrenisms like ""How about a litte fanfare, fanfare?"" from ""Todd"" and the quirky sound of the ""Golden Goose"" from ""Healing"". These shows are only available on DVD, as far as I can tell, but the visuals and the sound will not disappoint you, whether you're a neophyte or a seasoned fan of Todd's work. It's difficult for me to separate the two disks primarily because of the interviews and, again, in my opinion, the interviews are worth the price of each disk alone. For those of you who are curious and interested in learning about Todd's career, from his experiences with his early bands to the production side of the coin regarding albums he has produced for other artists, these two concerts present a joyful journey into Todd's music from a live perspective and the dissemination of historical information about the man and his accomplishments.",1430870400,,2137,4.747311827956989
8518685,5,B007K7ICCY,"I'm in my forties so Todd is really out my generation but I was introduced through my parents who are both lifelong Todd fans as I am after I checked out his catalogue when I got old enough to appreciate it.  Healing may as well be Todd's ""What's going on?"" of his catalogue.  Really has to be listened to as a whole to appreciate because it takes you through an experience from beginning to end.  That being said Todd does tinker with the song sequence a little but not enough affect the arc of the concert.  We watched this new years eve this year (2014) after being dismayed at how horrid all of the entertainment for the ny eve specials were.  The line up includes Jesse Wess,  Kasim Sultun,  and Prarie Prince who have been playing with him for years,  youth choir from a performing arts school and several others.
  I think hardcore Todd fans are more than a little spoiled by this unparalleled pop songwriter.  He continues to work his butt off touring (he toured 3/4's of the year for his album, a solo tour, and with Ringo Starr) and releasing albums (I think around 7 in the last 10 years) well into his sixties now.  I guess my point is take or leave it with hardcore fans griping...  ...He has nothing to prove to anyone anymore and I'm happy that he still wants to put music out and perform still.  It's not always perfect but when it's good really good and really hard to compare to anyone except maybe him...
  Ok anyways for my little aside...  The performances really start to give goosebumps a quarter of the way in with ""Pulse"" and ""Flesh"" really setting the stage for the three acts of ""Healing""...  I found it incredibly moving at times as did other friends with limited awareness of Todd's catalogue.  My best friend was almost asleep before we put the DVD in and was at the edge of his seat when the concert ended.  The content of the songs is just the best of everything we hoped and still hope music can be.  Uplift and inspire not just entertain and dumb down...",1421884800,2,1988,4.406593406593407
8518686,3,B007K7ICCY,"Like another reviewer I had the good fortune of seeing Todd perform this music live in Hartford 2012. It was, to say the least, a religious experience. My quibble with this release is not the music nor the performance but the sound quality. This DVD sounds more like a really good bootleg than a modern day live recording. On the audio option screen one is teased with a Dolby 5.1 surround sound option but when selected only delivers Dolby 2.0 Stereo. If you revel in surround sound, like myself, this will be an almost unforgivable error. So I deducted two stars, one for not delivering 5.1 as promised and another for the MP3 like quality that is delivered only in stereo.",1420329600,5,675,4.586776859504132
