5102665,5,B007P9HVJC,"No Tyler Perry Bashing here.  Get over it already.  I really enjoyed this play a lot.  The message was about a bitter mother who was divorced with 2 kids and making her ex husband who has married a younger girl life miserable.  She has became a drunk and has been brain washing her slow son with lies and giving him drugs.  Her daughter is a good girl and loves her daddy but is so sad that her mother has crossed over to such a dark side.  Aunt Bam does a really good job at holding this one together and keeping you laughing.

In the end I felt uplifted, inspired & happy and because of that I have decided to add this one to my DVD library",1339459200,4,642,4.0476190476190474
5102666,1,B007P9HVJC,"Although TP put together a brand new cast. He got singers who are mediocre actors instead of actors who can sing. If this was a opera musical where the actors sang for 2hrs... My review would be different.

The theme was under developed. Plot melodramatic.  Actors lackluster. In essence ""Aunt Bam's Place"" is... WHACK! However the non-actors made a decent attempt to be any good with what they had to work with in regards to the script.

In conclusion ""Bam"" is a sidekick and should have stayed as such. Not worth her own show. This was thrown together to make money from DVD sales (genius btw)  because this production didn't tour.

I can't hate. Until TP has some competition this is what we get. Welp David E. Talbert is bringing it... A great producer in his own right. Let's give credit where credit it due, both men have different approaches. But one has moved away from the ""chitterling circuit"" while...

Oh gee didn't I say ""in conclusion"" like 2 paragraphs ago?

Okay... Done!",1339459200,3,987,4.670520231213873
5102667,1,B007P9HVJC,"I love Aunt Bam's character. She is the perfect sidekick for Madea and Cassi Davis's comedic timing is amazing, but not even her antics and humor can save this play. Its a little more dramatic and over-the-top than Tyler's usual plays and while the singing is AMAZING, the script and subject of the play is weak and at times way less than entertaining. Hopefully Tyler will do Cassi Davis justice and write a play that is deserving of her skill and presence.",1339459200,34,458,4.597560975609756

5102672,5,B007P9HVJC,I love Tyler Perry plays! As far as I am concerned this is a great play. It has a scene in it that will make your head spin. The things some folks will do to destroy others. A great message about dealing with personal pain and how to treat others.,1502409600,2,247,3.96

This particular play though, while it had some wholesome points, and a few jokes, it didn't have that much weight without Madea. There were moments I literally was searching for a laugh but my expectations weren't met. I watched it anyway and will definitely keep in my Tyler Perry Collection.",1470009600,,361,4.838709677419355

If you looking for a Tyler Perry play just To laugh don't buy it. yes they are funny points in this play, but this play tackles serious stuff,  and I thank God he did. A lot of times we want to avoid seriousness but we have to use laughter to help us reach the ones in need.  not everything in life is so happy but its good how he uses his gift to help others.

You can take from this Tyler's wisdom and knowledge so its never a waste of money to purchase a Tyler Perry production.,1386633600,,279,4.283018867924528

5102791,5,B007P9HVJC,"Tyler Perry has done it again. Aunt Bams Place the play is about alcoholism and how to talk to people who have a problem, a loved one or a friend. i felt this was very imformative, to help recognize the signs or figure a way to bring it to someone you care abouts attention while having a little fun with such a serious situation. Tyler Perry always has a message in his movies or plays and they deal with life events. A must see even if you don't buy",1375142400,,451,4.078651685393258

I have since showed it to a few people who really needed to know that their not alone in this world and Thank You to Tyler Perry for this roller coaster ride  of faith that alot of people don't have today.  You have to have faith that everthing will work out , maybe not the way you expect but the way it's suppose to go.
Thank You Again Tyler",1370995200,,449,3.9555555555555557

The play was very intense and I was not expecting it to be that intense. It did not have that humor that Tyler other plays have.

5102867,3,B007P9HVJC,I love tyler perry movies. the play was ok there was a good message to it. But myself i think i will stick to his movies. Plays just aren't my thing. But tyler perry is really good at movies.,1349740800,,191,3.923076923076923

5102870,2,B007P9HVJC,"Tyler Perry's Aunt Bam's Place was okay to me. A bit too deep and not as funny as his other plays! I have nothing against deep and meaningful messages, but I love to have my laughs with Tyler Perry's plays, and this one wasn't as fuuny!",1348531200,2,236,4.1521739130434785
5102871,5,B007P9HVJC,A great and funny movie.  Mr. Perry did it again. Aunt Bam is just like many aunt's in the past and now.  Family is important and this is a reminder of that and that Jesus should be in with us all.,1348185600,,197,3.7804878048780486

5102874,2,B007P9HVJC,Ok. I never cared too much for Aunt Bam simply because she is soo freakin loud! All the time! Trying too darn hard to be funny! I decided to be more open minded but that was an epic FAIL. I don't know if I am just outgrowing stage plays but I am pretty sure it's the character Aunt Bam throwing me off with her loudness. Not all black aunts are loud and obnoxious. Bring it down a couple notches.,1347494400,,396,4.025316455696203
5102875,3,B007P9HVJC,"I give this play 3 1/2 stars. It was good, but not as good, as some of the other plays I have seen by him. I liked ""What's Done in the Dark"" better and it was cheaper. I paid $3.99 for Aunt Bam's Place, and $1.99 for What's Done in the Dark, maybe because it's an older play (not sure) but it was funnier.",1347148800,,305,3.78125

5102880,3,B007P9HVJC,"I love Tyler Perry, I own all his plays and movies. I really like Cassi Davis (Aunt Bam) she is halarious. Great story line but it seemed rushed. It seemed everything happened so quickly I didn't get an understanding of what was really going on, then it was over. I will watch it again and again I am sure but it will not make my list of Tyler Perry favorites.",1345161600,2,360,4.1571428571428575
5102881,5,B007P9HVJC,"I liked this musical and I do not usually care for them. But Tyler Perry made you feel like you were actually in church when watching the musical portions.

5102883,5,B007P9HVJC,As always Tyler never lets me down. Funny and also brings messages of hope and redemption. Love the aunt bam character she is a hot mess lol,1344384000,,140,4.222222222222222
5102884,2,B007P9HVJC,"This is not one of Tyler Perry's better plays. Although the message in the play is awesome, the total play itself is rather boring, it really needed an appearance by Madea.  Aunt Bam is funny, but not funny enough to handle the entire play by herself.  If I had saw this play from someone buying it first then I wouldn't have purchased it myself.  If you are a parent and trying to send a  message to your young teen about drugs, then this is a great teacher play but as far as entertainment, there are funny parts but overall you'll be rather disappointed.  Sorry Tyler.",1344297600,2,571,4.4
5102885,3,B007P9HVJC,"but this play-not so much. I enjoyed Aunt Bam, I loved how they sat on the couch together and sang I Just Cant Give Up Now, and i was SOOO impressed that Melonie Daniels is in this!!!! I wish she could have sang a whole lot more, she is super talented, much sought after in the gospel and secular world.

I didn't care for the childrens acting nor the married couple. I think maybe I am just used to the vibe of all the TP casts and this cast didn't connect for me. Ive seen all of them in other plays and they have all shined but in this one, with them all together, NO MAAM! Cassi did her thing as the Veteran!!! She tried to anchor the whole thing...She was super funny as usual and she held her own as the voice of authority and reason.

Im still glad I supported TP. I love the whole cast, just don't want to see them alone...in a play....together...ever again...",1344038400,6,868,4.160714285714286
5102886,4,B007P9HVJC,I enjoyed the play.  It was not Madea but it was good.  I just wish they would have given Aunt Bam more spice.,1343865600,,110,3.739130434782609
5102887,3,B007P9HVJC,"Cassi davis funny and awesome. Kudos to the new actors
However, there was way to much singing . He should have made it a musical.",1343260800,,129,4.2
5102888,5,B007P9HVJC,"This was a good play, it dealt with real life stuff that actually happens in some messed up families and as you know all of our families comes with some type of issues most people just try and hide them. The young Ms. Bennett did her thing. Even though we take the time out to criticize the actors, the producers but do we really stop to think how hard it is to put all this together, weather it's good or bad? I don't think we do because complaining about it seems so much easier. It was a good story line I liked the movie and it will be in my collection very soon,I used Amazon's online rental to check it out first because I read so many bad reviews first.",1343001600,,660,4.084615384615384
5102889,5,B007P9HVJC,I bought this DVD to see if I would love her more by herself  and it was a great play with alot of meaning everyone should own this PLAY. You go Aunt Bam smooches.,1342656000,5,163,3.7941176470588234
5102890,1,B007P9HVJC,"Most times people will go to movies and plays to get away from life's situations or drama's, (not to be reminded of the troubles constantly facing them each and every day).  Maybe Tyler Perry was trying to deliver a message, but I think this message would have come across a little better in a movie vs. a play.  That way when it is presented as a movie you will also get the rating, therefore you kinda know what to expect.  I didn't think this play was funny at all, and I hope Tyler Perry wasn't trying to convey a christian message, because these days in Tyler's plays and/or movies there is no more christian values present.  He said that he would not let Hollywood change him.  What happened?",1342483200,2,698,4.421875
5102891,5,B007P9HVJC,"I was pleasantly surprised by Aunt Bam's Place.  I expected a typical Tyler Perry play, and I was greeted with a refreshing change of pace.  While I have never seen a Tyler Perry production that I didn't like, the acting and singing in this play were incredible.  My favorite performer in this work was Taral Hicks. I've been a fan of hers for years, and I never knew she could sing, too. Of course, all of the actors delivered great work.

I highly recommend this play - the ensemble number at the end makes the entire experience worth your time.",1342483200,,547,4.44
5102892,5,B007P9HVJC,This was the first time I rented video to see on line.  The movie was fantastic.  One of the funnest movie I have ever seen.  Thank you again Tyler Perry.,1342483200,,154,4.066666666666666
5102893,2,B007P9HVJC,This movie was scary and I did not like it. Do better on this because it was not the best,1342310400,,89,3.5
5102894,5,B007P9HVJC,"I have all of Tyler Perry's DVD's of his movies and plays.  Whatever he puts out, I try my best to get it.  This is Tyler Perry's season and he is doing well.  He cares about people, he tries to help as many people as he can and he loves what he does.  Many people try to bash what he does, but he presents things in a funny way, but it has a true and deep message in whatever he puts out.  When he takes on serious roles, he is also just as good.  This goes to show you what a phenomenal actor he is and a producer and writer.  Continue to good work Tyler and never mind the negative things people have to say.  People will never agree with everything we do so he has to keep writing and producing good movies.  You must have this DVD.  Cassie Davis is a good actor anyway.  I really enjoy watching her act.",1342224000,,808,3.9565217391304346
5102895,5,B007P9HVJC,"Some people have no concept of the real world and life issues,I saw this play I brought the DVD and was glad I did. Tyler Perry did not drop the ball on this one, He just moved to another court and played ball there. You see the negative people all want to see Mabel Simmons ( aka Madea ) in all the work that Mr. Perry puts out. This man has a mission from God, and the word of God says go ye therefore and teach all nations not just the people that want to laugh. What happened at Aunt Bams place is so real it hurts but if you have never been down that road you could not even begin to comprehend the play, I live in a real world where life is not all laughs we cry sometimes and if you ha ha hee hee people would open your hearts and not just your eyes maybe just maybe you will see more than just the forest for the trees. My Hat go off to Mr. Tyler Perry because he hit on a subject that few people talk about. By the way this peticular play knocked on my doorsteps because I have a family member going through the same scenario right now. So if you want to laugh all the time don't look for it always in His plays look for the message and maybe you too will laugh to keep from crying I detest ignorant people and I pray for your undertanding. The Bible says in all your getting get understanding. Mr. Tyler Perry I aaplaud you because you are going where few men and woman dare to go. God Bless You!",1342137600,3,1406,3.954225352112676
5102896,5,B007P9HVJC,Tyler Perry has done it again.  Aunt Bam's Place touches your life in a sensitive and funny way.  The players bring the message loud and clear with a touch of humor and a message to the heart.,1342137600,,192,4.162162162162162
5102897,5,B007P9HVJC,Very good play displaying difficult times that may arise from substance abuse.  Tyler I think this may help others who may be in this circumstance.  Very well written.  We need more Aunt Bam's in this world!,1342137600,,207,4.694444444444445
5102898,4,B007P9HVJC,"It was a good play, had very good advice on some of today's serious topics, a play just isn't a play without Madea...",1341792000,,117,4.130434782608695
5102899,2,B007P9HVJC,"What can I say about Aunt Bam's Place, like all of Tyler Perry's movie they have a great message.  Aunt Bam could have been a lot funnier, maybe she needed her sidekick my girl Hattie to help her out with the laughs.",1341792000,,216,4.142857142857143
5102900,5,B007P9HVJC,"I thought this play was really good. I was caught off guard by the intensity of the storyline because Tyler has never taken me there before, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. There are a few laughs, but like I said the storyline is a lot more intense, so there was only so much comedy you could fit into the dialogue. If you enjoy intense stories that deliver a STRONG message then you will probably like it, but if you're expecting the comedy that Aunt Bam and Madea are known for, then you may not like it as much because the STORYLINE overshadows the comedy. In this case I can see why there wasn't AS much comedy, but like I said there were a few laughs that were needed to lighten the mood.",1341705600,16,691,4.242424242424242

I just didn't like this one.",1340841600,15,318,3.9076923076923076

5102904,5,B007P9HVJC,"I really enjoyed this play. Tyler Perry did his thing. I wasn't as emotional with this one as I am with the other plays he's done but I enjoyed it. The singing was awesome and Paris did her thing. And OMG the song ""You Don't Understand"" I kept rewinding it...I truly enjoyed the play and Aunt BAM, Aunt BAM, Aunt BAM I cracked up when she talked about riding the lawn mower, I couldn't get enough I kept rewinding that part too...oh and ""I wish, I wish, I wish....that baby don't know nothing, you cant do that to her."" I was too through...but seriously though I kind of connected to the mother only because my dad was a alcohol abuser when I was young around 8 years old and my dad was a really bad man. But thank God for Jesus cause he's been clean for almost 18 years. Anywhoo and that song at the end ""I just cant give up now"". My former pastor would wipe out a church singing that song so that really touched me...I will say it would have been awesome for Madea to come in and slap ""Gloria"" upside the head but I believe Aunt BAM verbally slapped her when she was in that bedroom. Great job Tyler Perry now I cant wait to see ""Witness Protection""",1340236800,,1151,4.1891891891891895

Her ex-husband is happy, and now married to another woman. Aunt Bam walks into the situation of anger that's brewing, and attempts to help out in every way she possibly can. I am a Big Fan of Tyler Perry, and have Enjoyed this play as much as I enjoy his movies and sitcom. The character who portrays Aunt Bam is the Miss. Ella who we all have come to love and adore on 'The House Of Payne.' In this Play, once again, she comes to the rescue in a family drama, trying to teach Right-From-Wrong and she does it well as she usually turns gloom into sunshine. The cast of characters are Superb, and the play is Educational as well as funny and entertaining. Highly Recommended!",1340064000,2,808,4.429530201342282
5102906,5,B007P9HVJC,"I've been a Tyler Perry fan since the very beginning. I've seen every single stage play & and movie of his. This has to be his best Madea-less play! Cassi Davis (Madea 2.0) was an absolute joy to watch in this. She was the glue that held everything togther. Other highlights were the singing of (American Idol Season 5 finalist) Paris Bennett & (Youtube Sensation) Melanie Daniels! These two ladies can sing the heavens open! All of the singing was on point. I know some of you might think that this is the same ole Tyler Perry play with the same ole message. This play hit home on so many levels (acholism,drugs,love & lies) to name a few. Tyler always leaves his fans with some kind of message or teach them something they didn't know beforehand. It might be a little redundant @ times. 'But it never gets old in this cruel & evil world'.",1339977600,2,840,4.425806451612903

5102911,3,B007P9HVJC,"I've all but given up on TP, and this play hasn't done much to win me over again. The only reason I even considered seeing is because Paris Bennett (who I've loved since American Idol) is in it. She did the best she could with this script (don't even get me started on the script) andI think she could have a real future in acting with a bit more polish and training. I also got a kick out of Aunt Bam's antics. And of course, the singing was phenomenal (par for the course in a TP play). Other than that, nothing really sticks out about this production. I'm glad I saw it, but I really could've saved the $14.99.",1339545600,6,613,4.159663865546219
