There are 2 DVDs in this 1995 Rugby World Cup DVD set. The first DVD shows all the tournament highlights, inclusive of the Grand Final itself.  The second DVD shows the Grand Final only, with some pre-match and post-match celebrations and interviews. There's some great action here!

Please take note - the DVD set itself is recorded in the PAL colour system. And it states that it's Region-Free or All-Region. That helps a little, I guess.

For myself, I had no trouble playing the DVDs, but only because I played it on my PC. I hadn't played it on an actual DVD player. But I guess there's no reason why it shouldn't be able to play.

Overall, It's a great DVD, worth your while getting it for your collection!
