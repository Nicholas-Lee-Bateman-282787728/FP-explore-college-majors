5657462,1,B00BNADY8Q,"Shout Factory dishonestly markets these as having Chinese language tracks in addition to English, which they don't.  As someone who dislikes dubbing, not only am I disappointed at the lack of a Chinese language track, but I'm appalled by Shout Factory's dishonesty.  I've contacted them about this, both by email and their forum, but I never heard back from them.  I had to notify Amazon about the inaccuracy so that nobody else would be duped.",1406764800,4,444,4.8933333333333335
5657463,4,B00BNADY8Q,"After an initial budget priced release of The Killer Meteors & New Fist of Fury through Shout! Factory's Timeless Media label, Shout quickly followed it up with another overlooked pair of Jackie Chan films from the Golden Harvest library. Below is an overview of this particular release...

Shaolin Wooden Men (1976)
One of Jackie Chan's earliest attempts at displaying his natural comedic talents (even if only in a few scenes), he shows some incredible martial arts skills all the while nary saying a word (his character having taken a vow of silence). Ignore the Lo Wei directing credit (he really only produced this), ""Executive Director"" Chen Chi-Hwa is the one who really deserves credit for allowing Jackie his first chance at breaking away from the ""next Bruce Lee"" image Lo Wei tried to impose on him.

To Kill With Intrigue (1977)
Starring a more sullen Jackie Chan in a bad hair piece, he spends half of the film wandering the cold Korean countryside crying out for his beloved, with the other half having him passed around between several characters who all want a piece of him for differing reasons. A Lo Wei-directed mess of a story saved by its excellent fight scenes.

Video:
Both prints have been remastered by licensor Fortune Star, but several instances of print damage are still on display, with the most obvious occurring during the final reels of both films. Shaolin Wooden Men's final fight scene includes several instances of slight discolorations and occasional dropped frames, likely removed because of excessive print damage from the original negative having been recut in the past for theatrical re-releases. To Kill With Intrigue's final fight includes some inconsistent contrast issues during scene changes, which appear to be inherent to the original print used for the remaster. Despite these flaws, this is still the best either film has looked in decades. Both prints have also been ""pinkified"" like most Fortune Star remasters, causing reds to push more towards magenta and giving our lead characters the occasional tomato face (although not necessarily as bad as the previous release for The Killer Meteors & New Fist of Fury).

Audio:
Audio on both films is English dub only, which is disappointing but not a surprise for what's meant to be a budget-priced release. Audio quality is a mixed bag, with several bouts of background hiss and crackling, especially on To Kill With Intrigue. The first couple dialogue scenes of Shaolin Wooden Men is also missing its original English dub because of damaged source material, so newer (and obviously much clearer) replacement English dialogue has been substituted in its place. There are also several instances of new Foley sound effects overlaid into the film's audio, with To Kill With Intrigue being the biggest offender. One sequence in particular takes place next to a waterfall, and if you can keep yourself from yelling at your TV to ""turn down the damn waterfall"" for it's entire duration, you are a true Zen master!

Extras:
Extras include trailers for both films in their original language but without subtitles, a minor annoyance. There is also a brief on-screen text article included outlining Lo Wei's attempt at making Jackie into the next Bruce Lee, and touches on the making of To Kill With Intrigue. However, despite being about To Kill With Intrigue, the article was erroneously included only on the menu for Shaolin Wooden Men (whoops). Also, unlike the previous Shout/Timeless release of The Killer Meteors & New Fist of Fury which listed Stills as an extra but included none, this disc DOES include Stills as an extra, mainly comprised of promotional images and lobby card scans.

Overall:
Although this release cuts corners the same has the previous The Killer Meteors & New Fist of Fury disc, improvements have been made in terms of extras, and it carries the same low price as well, making this an easy purchase and another easy recommend. To Kill With Intrigue is a mess of a movie with great fight scenes, while Shaolin Wooden Men is an underrated classic. Buy it for the Kung Fu.",1402876800,8,4085,4.9824046920821115

8571523,3,B00BNADY8Q,"Shout factory has unveiled two jackie chan films from his lo wei era. Shaolin wooden men is mediocre at best with its cliched story and terribly choreographed fight scenes. On the other hand, to kill with intrigue is a good film. The story is interesting if convoluted. The acting is great. Jackie really shines as a sorrowful, lovesick sole named siao lei. Jackie convincingly plays the somber and grim lord of the lei family. I am not even going into the plot because it is quite hard to explain. The action scenes are top notch. The finale fight is in my top five favorite fight scenes of all time. The films are in a nice widescreen presentation. The dvd includes the original trailers for each respected film and some bonus info on this lo wei stage of his career and how lo wei tried to make jackie into the next bruce lee. Despite shaolin wooden mens shortcomings, i recommend this dvd for to kill with intrigue and the widescreen presentations, and the original trailers.",1459123200,,979,4.632183908045977
