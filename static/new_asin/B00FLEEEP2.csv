8616698,5,B00FLEEEP2,"We watched ""The Assassination of Jesse James"" in anticipation of the Oscars ceremony where Casey Affleck was nominated for Best Actor. (We were rooting for him there, so were glad when he won.) It was fascinating to see Casey Affleck's portrayal of the young man who shot Jesse James. He showed a range I hadn't seen before and also demonstrated how his ""Manchester by the Sea"" acting was really acting. Brad Pitt is charismatic in his role as Jesse James so you get a sense of why Jesse James was such a folk hero. The last 30 minutes of the movie were outstanding.",1488672000,,566,4.504854368932039

8616700,5,B00FLEEEP2,"The Assassination of Jesse James...  this movie should have received acclaim or awards.  Casey Affleck gave a riveting performance. He was believable in this film.  I was on the edge of my seat saying, ""Can't you see this guys motives Jesse?!""  Brad Pitt was great in this film and I don't usually subscribe to his films.  The cinematography alone in this movie should have won an academy award.  Some of he scenes in this movie will take your breath away.

Appaloosa was good move; Harris and Mortensen are exceptional actors- intense and convey the depth of their character. Renee Zellweger character... we could have done without.  This was a good western to a certain point.  I felt like it all fell apart about 40 minutes into the film, but redeemed itself towards the end.",1434240000,,778,4.746268656716418
