Star Wars is a great franchise, I prefer the later episodes of this show personally, but this attempt at a dvd release is like buying the single before the album comes out.

Fans make excuses for Lucasfilm all the time in relation to their releases, and their paying for it.

DON'T BUY THIS DVD, PLEASE SHOW THAT THE CUSTOMER, NOT THE STUDIO, IS ALWAYS RIGHT!!!",1232668800,22,576,4.519230769230769
3545670,2,B001E533E0,"The announcement of this bare bones, single disc has caused quite a stir in some fan communities..and apparently here on Amazon as well.

Here's the skinny: At the bottom of the press release for this single DVD, Lucasfilm clearly states a box set for Season 1 (with extras) is in the works, including Blu Ray. I have to give them credit for at least telling us up front that this DVD is not intended for the people that will want the whole season. Although I am not sure who the intended consumer is for this, I guess almost an hour and a half for $14 is enough to keep the little ones quiet in the back seat of the SUV and make it so you don't have to worry about losing a disc from your box set.

For releasing a no frills single DVD: 1/5
For content: 3.5/5
For telling me to wait a few months for a season box set: 5/5",1232582400,134,822,4.067901234567901

I was going to dive in and purchase this, but once again the movie makers have decided to give you and I the usual ""rip off""
Here are the first four episodes, that carry on pretty much exactly from where the movie finished, and make no mistake the stories, animation and acting (voices) are all excellent, but I ask again, 4 Episodes???
My kids have seen at least 12 screened on TV at around 25 minutes per episode. Are you telling me that we need to buy 3 or 4 separate DVD's to get a whole series already shown on TV? That's a joke.
My advice, when it's all old news (in a few months) a ""complete collection"" will come out, and I guarantee it will be cheaper. Vote with your wallets folks, stop letting them rip us off.",1232236800,118,874,4.208333333333333

I wasn't sure if this was going to be a good show or not, and if it would be corny, and it ended up being good. This is a good additive to the Star Wars collection and I can't until it come out on DVD to buy and add to my collection.

3545677,2,B001E533E0,"Good ole $tar Wars... If I'm chillin', looking at some TV, I'll sometimes watch this show. Like today there was a marathon playing on Cartoon Network. What I was thinkin' is this product here goes to show you what Lucas is about. A friend owns it and found out *after* purchasing from the store it isn't the whole season. Lol. For starters, it is a quality show. I enjoy it, but it is for the kids mostly. The little kids in my life really love it. Seems obvious now that Lucas always wanted Star Wars to be mainly for small kids. To the extent he wanted the movies to be for adults too just shows what a weirdo he is. (I'm thinking of the prequels in particular.) ""The Empire Strikes Back"", the most adult friendly of the series, is according to Lucas himself his least favorite! The other thing is this product is simply shameless cashing-in by a media empire and that's all there is to it. LOOK, NO good reason to release the series like this. But no big deal, this is just typical. Media mogul Lucas is gonna milk it for all it is worth baby! Just like the Hollywood swine he loathes. But whatever. If your an unabashed Star Wars nerd *still* even post-prequels, watch your pocket book. Look into the future, and you need not big strong with the Force to have a vision of yourself clicking buy buttons or checking out at Best Buy with DVD collections and re-releases and re-re-re-re-releases -- the Super-Duper Deluxe Ultimate Platinum Collection Blue Laser 3000 versions and what-have-you -- for years and years to come. You WILL be spending countless thousands... AND on movies and TV shows you already have copies of. Blue Ray will be sooo outdated in a few short years and you will want the best picture and sound available, and then what replaces Blue Ray will come and go. At least be wise with your hard earned money. Lucas has enough. Skip these rip-off collections. And if your a spoiled rich kid and yuppie or middle class person with money to burn and don't care about dumb purchases at least realize your why there are so many dumb products like this in the first place.

3545679,1,B001E533E0,"Once again Lucusfilms tries to milk the fans of Star Wars for everything they got. As in the Star Wars release, they released the film, then with extras, then with extended scenes, then remastered, then boxed. So rather than do what other companies do and release the full season, they're leasing them at 4 episodes at a time. Yet with no release date announced, the entire series will in time be released in a box set. With the next dish set to be released 9/14/09, you maybe better off waiting for the box set and say no to the 4 episode DVD.

The series once you get past the animation is great, great voice acting, stories and new characters. They've showed that the Stormtrooper clones are more than just cannon fodder that films 4-6 showed them to be. That Anikin's and Padame's marriage did have it happy moments.

3545690,1,B001E533E0,"No, No, No, and a thousand times NO. Listen up Lucas, there is absolutely no value and no market share to be had in attempting to release ANY kind of TV series one-shot or 4-shot or whatever. The public will only allow you to START with one thing, we will gladly pay for the ENTIRE season in a single box set with no questions asked, but we will be d$#@ned if we will shill out even a single cent for this kind of underhanded flimflammery. I pretty much like the series, and can tolerate even Ashoka in it, as long as absolutely outstanding set pieces like the Y-wing story or Yoda's patrol or the Clonetrooper station continue to flow. I want to buy the series. I will buy the series, but, we WILL NOT buy it piecemeal. I will give you a hint, look at something like the X-files (Black Oil) or Star Trek-TNG (Q), the SEASON comes first, then if you want to release ""specialist"" titles, like ""The Yoda Stories"" or ""Ashoka's Tale"" or ""Sith Revealed"" as ""Best-of"" anthologies, go ahead and you may indeed find buyers, but NOT UNTILL THE SEASON (or whole series) is IN THE CAN and already on the market in it's entirety!!!!!!!!

The Writer's Strike was the original excuse for all the shows that decided to put out a ""half-season"" set to try to cling to their fanbases, but even that was a tough pill to swallow. Guess what, the strike is OVER now and we can see the mercenary glint in your eyes quite clearly and it will not be tolerated.",1238112000,3,1436,4.358208955223881

3545692,5,B001E533E0,"Being an avid Star Wars fan I truly love this series. There is an excellent voice cast and the animation is very real life. I truly find there is not a single episode that I haven't enjoyed and hasn't made me feel, even for less then 30 minutes (show minus commercials)as excited as I do watching the movies.

As to the whole issue with only four episodes, perhaps because I am also an anime fan, this whole four episodes a DVD for a series is nothing new to me, happens all the time with anime series, and for the pre-order price of about thirteen dollars this series for as good as it is and compared to what I sometimes pay for four or five episodes of anime, does actually look like a deal at first.

That said for a Star Wars series that seems to be so loved in general, a four episode DVD being released a little less then one week after season one finished its CN initial run and moved in part to AdultSwim, seems to be a very poor marketing choice. With a twenty-two episode season one (and the same estimated for season two) each season will have five or six DVD's (estimating either four episodes for three DVD's and five for two other DVDs or four episodes for four DVDs and three episodes for two others) which again speaking from anime experience can get very expensive very fast when collecting an entire season.

With the cost therefore of collecting that many discs more then anything else that can be taken into consideration, perhaps patience is the best course to take at present. If they do follow the pattern of anime releases they seem to be following for this non anime series, perhaps once all the DVD's are released on their own a complete collection will be released too probably somewhere in price from thirty to sixty-five dollars, still expensive but cheaper then buying about five or six discs at about twenty dollars each.

So overall a great series (five stars for ir), just a very unwise way to release it (but can't deduct stars since I think too many have already for the release pattern).

In that light I think we have to be very careful, I know why most have rated it one star, not for the series but for the release pattern of four episodes per DVD; yet for the many out there that still must learn patience and only skim quickly over different things this series is starting to look, just on the overall two stars it has based on nineteen reviews they may not read, as if everyone dislikes the series itself and not the fact the series is being released only four or so episodes per disc; so I advise caution in just how many stars are taken off for a season one most seem to love but dislike the four episode dvd release pattern taking place.",1237593600,3,2683,4.401209677419355

Yeah, on a widescreen tv you get the smooshed picture with black bars on top and bottom. I realize the cover does say 1.33:1, but the series is widescreen (broadcast 1.78:1).

Not even the Dolby Digital audio had any redeeming qualities. While the dialogue was easy to understand, overall it was flat: weak bass, little/no surround effects. Please DO NOT BUY this DVD.

8296414,4,B001E533E0,"The premiere of Star Wars: The Clone Wars was met with some skepticism by fans when it debuted October 3, 2008 on the Cartoon Network.  However, thus far most of the feedback from fans and critics has been mostly positive with many expressing surprise at how much they've enjoyed it.  The first DVD of the series has just been released and collects the first four episodes.

In ""Ambush"", Yoda is on a mission to meet with the King Katuunko and convince him to allow the Republic to build a base in Toydarian territory.  However, Count Dooku has dispatched the Dark Jedi Asajj Ventress to make a counter offer to the King.  A challenge is made between Yoda and his three Clone Troopers against Ventress and a battalion of Droid troopers.  The King will join whichever side wins!

An interesting first episode to start in that Yoda was allowed to be the main star.  It showed the Producer's confidence in the show that they didn't feel the need to go overboard with the pilot episode.  Nearly all the action takes place on a small moon as the two sides battle for victory.

The next three episodes on the DVD comprise the Malevolence saga, a three-part storyline which makes a near feature length film if you watch them all together.

""Rising Malevolence"" finds Jedi Master Plo Koon investigating rumors of a new secret weapon that the Separatists are using.  This weapon turns out to be an Ion cannon aboard a massive new warship named the Malevolence and commanded by General Grievious.  The Ion Cannon knocks out power to Plo Koon's ship, and eventually he and three clones drift helplessly in an escape pod, hoping someone can rescue them before their air runs out.

""Shadow of Malevolence""  Dooku orders Grievous to destroy a medical station where 60,000 wounded clones are being treated.  As the medical station races to evacuate the wounded, Anakin leads his Shadow Squadron bombers through the Balmora Run to a desperate attack on the Malevolence.

""Destroy Malevolence""  With the Malevolence severely damaged, Republic warships give chase, looking to destroy it once and for all.  But Dooku still has some tricks up his sleeve.  He's tricked a Republican Senator into the middle of the battle, leaving them to become a hostage for Grievous and a bargaining ship as well.  That Senator is Padm&eacute; Amidala and now Anakin and Obi-Wan must stage a daring rescue attempt on board the Malevolence that is crawling with Droid Troops.

The three-part Malevolence saga is still the highlight of the first season.  This was an epic storyline (at least in cartoon format) that rivals the films themselves.  The plot was much more detailed than I'd expect from a weekly show and featured an enormous cast of characters.
In general the animation is well-done.  The characters are as photo-realistic as I've ever seen in animation although they tend to suffer from the ""big head"" syndrome.  The animation of the action and the ships is a high point.

Two minor annoyances in regard to the voice acting is the cheesy narration at the beginning, which seems to be influenced by the old, overly dramatic Super Friends Cartoons.  Secondly is the incessant wisecracking of the droids for purposes of comic relief.

The only other complaint is the release of this DVD with only four episodes at a list price of $19.99.  I suppose that it's because they're aimed more at something cheap for kids while the more costly, full season DVDs will be geared towards adults, but I'd still like more bang for my buck.",1258588800,,3499,4.822147651006712
