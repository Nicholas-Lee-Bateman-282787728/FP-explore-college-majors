8543577,5,B009PAO5SO,"We just got this in the mail today and my son was pretty happy with it. It came well recommended by friends.  It's the first DVD I've bought for him and I felt confident that the materiel in this DVD would all be appropriate - and it is .  Cute story line and educational. Overall pleased with it.  For those with younger children I would like to note that my son (almost 2 1/2) found the talking fruits and especially the talking challah in oven to be, I don't want to say scary, but he felt the need to have to have me sit next to him and tell him that it was okay.  I think if your children are used to animation they will love this.  If they're not, just plan to watch with them the first time.",1410998400,2,698,3.9928057553956835
