8008030,2,B00018WMUW,"This is the film I used to break out from time to time and show friends back in the day because NOBODY saw it at the theatre. It always got a very good reaction because it is a very creepy film. Even today the stop-motion effects will give most folks the creeps even while they're busy knocking the older effects model. The film seemed to be a labor of love from director Phillipe Mora because there are some genuine creepy moments that still work to this day 22 years later. Ronny Cox is the sole ""name "" in this movie although many may recognize R.G. Armstrong, Don Gordon, or L.Q. Jones. Don't let my positive review so far sell you however, there are plenty of lousey acted, slow paced scenes that add up to nothing here except filler acting as background info for the scenes of the ""change"" that takes place for the lead actor. The real emphasis in the movie is the special effects which were for the day awesome, but today are a bit goofy, but genre buffs will appreciate the effort nontheless. Still a good rent or cheap purchase.",1124150400,2,1037,4.40625

8008032,3,B00018WMUW,"I saw One of the movies on this set, Collinsville, at it's premiere, It is a very good first offering, with the amount of money they had to make it with. The acting is very good, especially the blind shop owner, and the screenplay is first rate. For the price i would recommend this DVD to anyone who likes low budget horror.",1073088000,2,325,4.258064516129032
