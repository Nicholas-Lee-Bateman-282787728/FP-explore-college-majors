8128476,4,B000G1R3ZS,"A little dry on the production side, but solid acting.",1425513600,,54,4.5
8128477,5,B000G1R3ZS,one of my favorites of all time.  this movie brings back memories and well as continuing to tickle me as I watch it again and again,1385164800,,131,4.038461538461538
8128478,2,B000G1R3ZS,"I'm 66, love Shakespeare, but years in the artillery, and running a jackhammer have left my ears aged and calloused like my vision.  So I have a sound need for subtitles or at least very clear dialogue,just so I could catch some words.  No subtitles means I may just throw these out.  Wish I had read the reviews carefully and noticed in the description of the dvd that there were no subtitles.  The sound quality is equally bad especially Macbeth.  MY BAD.",1364428800,8,457,4.524390243902439
8128479,5,B000G1R3ZS,"Two of the greatest names in British theatre lead a superb cast in the definitive version of ""Macbeth.""  It was filmed in a small theatre, so we feel the intimacy and claustrophobia of the whole history.  It's my favorite version of ""Macbeth,"" a play hard to produce and hard to maintain balance.",1354838400,3,296,4.673076923076923
8128480,5,B000G1R3ZS,THis is something you must have if you are interested in understanding Macbeth! Outstanding acting!!!! Dench and McKellen are  superb!!!! The only drawback is that it is not captioned!!!,1275782400,3,186,5.413793103448276
8128481,5,B000G1R3ZS,These DVD's are high quality acting with an excellent rendition of Shakespeare's classics.  Affordable luxuries are always the best.,1266105600,9,132,5.947368421052632
8128482,4,B000G1R3ZS,"The acting and sets are kind of corny. But they're old made-for-BBC productions, so what might one expect?",1259280000,,106,4.944444444444445
8128483,4,B000G1R3ZS,"This is a WONDERFUL production, well acted and interestingly staged, using modern costuming.  McKellan and Dench are in fine form, both as malevolent as they need to be.

As a teacher, however, I found this DVD to be a major disappointment, because for some silly reason the publisher did not bother to offer subtitles (which are immensely valuable to aid students' comprehension of a fairly difficult text).",1230422400,31,408,5.074626865671642
8128484,3,B000G1R3ZS,"I was disappointed... the films of live plays are visually flat, and the sound was mushy, and I really wished there were subtitles. In my opinion, the BBC productions are much better.",1184544000,40,183,4.75
