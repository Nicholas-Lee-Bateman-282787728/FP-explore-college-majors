8323598,5,1584961066,"I highly recommend this video. The presentation is high quality and includes the use of on-screen tab and titles (which made it easy to find the sections I was searching for when fast-forwarding.) Dan offers specific advice on which type of pick to use and how to hold it, how to strike the strings, how to anchor your picking hand, how to move your wrist, and much more regarding the small details of flatpicking that you can't get from a book or CD. Dan also gives brief, but highly detailed, demonstrations of how to tune your guitar, how to put strings on, and how to use a cassette tape player to learn songs. Dan gives measure-by-measure lessons on how to play the songs with specific instructions on how and when to down-stroke or up-stroke while moving from string to string. Based on my experience with this video I'll be purchasing more instructional material by Dan Huckabee.",1034726400,4,886,4.685897435897436
