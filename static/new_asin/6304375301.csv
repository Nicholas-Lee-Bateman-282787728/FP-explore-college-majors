However, he is confronted by his cousin Fred Munster (Terry-Thomas) who'll stop at nothing to get the wealth for himself. Fun to watch.",1049760000,9,319,4.818181818181818
858728,5,6304375301,"Despite alot of Munsters items out there that are bad quality, its still better that they are out there than if they weren't. These days it's hard to come by Munsters videos/books/dvd's, nearly anything, I miss them and I really hope the series comes out on dvd, but it is not likely, they will never be forgotten, they are legends in classic horror, the funniest family to ever grace a tv will never be matched, this film only raised their status, a must have for fans of the Munsters, fantastic!",1036540800,,497,4.533333333333333
858729,5,6304375301,"I was overjoyed when I saw this availabel on DVD. I only saw part of it once on TBS many years ago, back in the days when they used to show cheesy, rare or obscure but good movies, and it was never available on video until recently.
I got the DVD last night, watched it, and was extremely impressed with the clarity of the mastering, and the film print they used was superb! You would never know that this is a budget-line DVD, as the quality is that good! ...
For the movie itself, I really enjoyed it. You had Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher doing the writing, and so it's as every bit as good as the TV show. Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis were and are one of the greatest (though underrated) comedy teams; I esepcially liked Herman's shout of ""Car 54, where are you!"".I see there's another Marilyn here, which can be a little hard to take, especially if you like Pat Priest. ""The Munsters' Revenge"" is good in its own way (though it seems a little dated now), but this is required viewing if you're a Munsters fan. Go get it!",1035849600,4,1019,4.230769230769231
858730,4,6304375301,"In their first movie, Herman's uncle dies and bestows upon him lord of Munster Hall, which is in England. The whole family packs up, Herman, Lilly, Grandpa, Eddie, Marylyn, and head to England. The trip is on a cruise ship where Herman gets sea sick, Grandpa turns himself into a wolf and can't turn himself back, and Marylyn finds romance with a rival of the Munsters. Once they arrive in England, Lady Effigy and Freddie Munster, who throws a temper tantrum because he was not named Lord Munster, greets them. The greeting is in the form of a haunted house that make Herman and Lilly feel at home. Herman enters an auto race to uphold the family honor and he and Grandpa discover the secret of Munster Hall.
The quality of the DVD is good.
Herman is really Green!",1023062400,14,765,4.510791366906475

This movie still contains the magic of the show and the times unlike the later movie made ""Musters  Revenge"" which is also in my collection but not nearly as good as this  one.

858733,5,6304375301,"When the home video release of this minor classic was issued by Good Times Video (for the first time ever) a few years ago, I was overjoyed -- that is, until I saw that it was recorded on inferior stock at slow speed! Well,  weep no more, Munster fanatics!  This DVD release by Good Times makes up  for their earlier mistake.  The picture and sound quality is superp -- and  the source material is clean and crisp.  Finally, ""Munster, Go  Home!"" as I remember it -- in all of its Technicolor brilliance.  At  last, Herman is REALLY green -- the same color your friends will turn if  they don't own one. By the way, I really don't understand the disclaimer at  the beginning of the program.  The print as seen on DVD is exactly the  right aspect ratio.  ""Munster, Go Home!"" was shot in 1.33::1 --  just like the series.  The disclaimer leads the viewer to believe that the  film has been ""modified"".  Not true!

858918,4,6304375301,"Based on the classic B&W TV show this is a wonderful silly movie. Loved the Munsters as a child and still enjoy them. The movie is typical Munsters. It's ridiculous, stupid, G-rated fun. Little kids would love it (and some of us grown-ups).",1482537600,,240,4.604651162790698
858919,5,6304375301,"This was one of my favorite childhood movies and to finally get to watch it in Color was really cool, it basically picked up where the TV show left off, with an added twist of the Munster's getting to go to England was such a neat story, my only gripe was Marilyn was played by some totally different from the TV show. (But I got over it once the movie got under way). Lily Munster show's that she was very athletic with a lot of the stuff she went through trying to get to Herman when she and Grandpa found out someone was trying to hurt Herman.
If anybody wants to buy a copy of this movie, they have the DVD on Amazon Prime for under $10.00, and for digital purchase on prime also.",1481932800,,684,4.111940298507463

859181,4,6304375301,"Until here recently, I've never seen this vintage 1966 Munsters movie in it's entirety. Personally, I liked the Munster clan better - while viewed in vivid color. Quite refreshing. You get the usual slap-stick / bumbling Munster humor through out this flick. Several clever twists and memorable scenes. I got a good laugh when cousin Marilyn's date Roger was kissing her (twice, during the movie) he thought he was seeing things - when he caught a glimpse of her gruesome family. Also, when Herman is coaxed into participating in the car race. Avoid ALL later Munster remakes - keep with the irreplaceable original.",1316476800,,615,4.980582524271845

859186,4,6304375301,"The Munsters go to England, and of course end up in a car race. Grandpa builds a race car from a spare coffin, Herman drives it to a win. The race car was a variation of the George Barris ""Drag-U-La"" classic. Of course it was absurd to think Herman could win a race with the drag tires front and rear, but then the Munsters is all about suspension of disbelief. I have fond memories here, the Munsters was about the coolest show you could watch back in those days and George Barris was everywhere! I've got it on DVD; but unfortunately there is not a ""making of"" or retrospectives by the surviving cast.",1111190400,7,603,4.345132743362832

7869567,1,6304375301,"I have only one question--why?

I grew up watching the Munsters and The Addams Family (which was sooo much better) and faintly remember this movie. Saw it again on our favorite Saturday night horror show and couldn't believe how BAD it was. I am a fan of vintage movies and TV, but the plot for this messterpiece was ridiculous. I know it's campy but still--c'mon. The laughs were few and far between for me. One thing that really stood out is that sometimes makeup that looks good in black/white doesn't necessarily translate well to color. Although I loved the way Lily's dress and hair looked, there were flubs where at times it didn't work well at all. There were several instances where one can see the obvious line where Eddie's makeup ended just a bit past his chin, showing the line of demarcation where the makeup ended and his normal skin began. Also the very glaringly cheaply made sets demonstrated that sometimes black and white is a huge improvement over using color and can hide imperfections that stand out all too much when colorized.

This whole affair was way too silly for my taste. The major difference between the two ""ghoulish"" TV shows (both came out at the same time) is that the Munsters really were a typical family despite their odd looks but the Addams family were outright weird from the get go. I have to wonder what a movie would have been like if the Addams family had been transferred to the big screen back in the '60s and would it have been so, well, dumb as this one.

Yes, I know, I'm a spoilsport. Just my opinion; please don't flame me. We do get to see some great comedians of the era, and it's nice to watch Richard Dawson in an earlier role. But within the first ten minutes I could hear the ""gobble, gobble"" of a turkey in the background, which became ever more evident as the movie rolled on. Actually, one would have to pay me to sit through this one again.",1493510400,,1903,4.478386167146974
