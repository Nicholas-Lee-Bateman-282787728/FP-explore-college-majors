8379984,5,B002T6V6GU,"I was going to buy the complete boxed set, but it went up $30 from one week to the next, so I looked for other options and found this.  I received the set from CG Movies and Games (fulfilled by Amazon).  Each season was wrapped in factory packaging and the 8 seasons were taped together as one ""brick.""  After opening each of the 8 packages the pictures show what I received.  All of mine are new and have never been opened or viewed.

This set has the first season DVD with the extras, including the unaired pilot (see picture).

Our whole family enjoys this.  My husband and I like that it's entertaining, yet clean for our teen and toddler.",1435881600,,643,4.352941176470588

8379986,1,B002T6V6GU,"I bought this series from supermariobrosshop n I was soo excited to receive it. Unfortunately their discription was a total crock! ""Like new"" and they said they previewed it n had no problems... LIARS! Only 2 seasons outta the eight seasons box set worked. Most of the discs blurped n distorted the picture makin it hard to watch n some didn't work at all saying ""error please eject"". The worst thing is that THEY WOULDNT REFUND ME!! They wanted me to spend more to send it back to resurface to resell it to the next poor sucker. If there was a way to rate them in the negatives id give them a --",1405900800,,596,4.283185840707965
