8462794,4,B00596767A,"Being an avid lover of Schumann's music I was very happy to add this DVD to my collection. The video quality is not
great and the audio is decent. The performance of the German actor playing Manfred is excellent. The orchestral
playing is quite good, not the Berlin Philharmonic. The conductor is no Beecham or Szell. Still I am happy to add this DVD to my collection as it helps one to have a better appreciation of Byron's epic work.",1380758400,3,435,4.45
8462795,4,B00596767A,"Schumann's magnificent overture and interesting incidental pieces to a reading of Byron's closet drama MANFRED is  given a very effective and interesting production here directed by Johannes Deutsch, with the Dusseldorf Symphony conducted by Andrey Boreyko, and with Johann von Bulow as Manfred. Filmed in 2010, in the Tonhalle in Dusseldorf,  the town where Schumann lived at the time of the composition of this and many of his other late pieces, this production was part of the celebration of the composer's 200th birthday.  The orchestra may not be world class, and the overture alone, which is familiar to most listeners, is available in several other great performances, such as that by George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra, available on Sony, but Andery Boreyko gets generally very fine playing from his Dusseldorfers of all the music, making this the one to get for the complete score. It's far superior to either of the two cd versions, and is more complete, because it's an attempt to stage the entire work in a manner close to what Schumann had in mind.

  First to the music itself. The Overture is, of course, a great classic, and one of the incidental pieces may remind listeners of the solemn fourth movement of the ""Rhenish"" Symphony, while another seems to have been inspired by Berlioz's ""Dance of the Will o' the Wisps"" from his THE DAMNATION OF FAUST, though Schumann is the lesser orchestrater. However, the use of Alpine cow bells in another piece shows us that Mahler's Sixth Symphony is not the first work to use those non-pitched instruments.

  Schumann skillfully selected about 1,500 or so lines from Byron and apparently added a few of his own as transitions to provide the basic plot of the drama which sounds natural and effective in German, showing a close familiarity with Byron.  This production centers on an excellent dramatic reading in German by several actors, with the part of Manfred, the well-known Byronic, Faustian rebel, well done by Johann von Bulow.  The music tends to set the mood, while the actors and singers try to push things along as well as they can, so this is really a play, or a shortened version of one, with music. Those who don't relish listening to all that German, since Schumann knew Byron's poetry in a translation, may be put off, but the English subtitles provide us with Byron's words. I found myself wishing for more music, though, since we can always read the play in a collection of Byron, but there doesn't seem to be any other live production of this poem as a play, so lovers of Byron and of drama may be interested. For those interested in Schumann's music alone, you might want to stick with the Overture in the recording already mentioned, since the short incidental pieces add little to our appreciation of this early Romantic composer. Byron is not a truly great poet, as Goethe is, for example, so while his MANFRED has many beautiful lines, it's not a fully realized work, as FAUST is, and the Overture expresses everything there is in the poem, being a kind of tone poem similar to Beethoven's ""Leonora"" Overtures 2 & 3.  Better to get the new Naxos cd of Schumann's SCENES FROM FAUST, written shortly after MANFRED.

  Johannes Deutsch's production deserves mention since he uses technology which Schumann obviously didn't have, though I think Schumann would have not only approved of the electronic and video magic,  but probably would have used it actively himself. His MANFRED seems to cry out for just such an approach which attempts to integrate the imagery of the drama with the performance; projected videos of Alpine scenes and other appropriate backdrops help to set the scene and show us where the play takes place. Some of the live projections of von Bulow's face are perhaps too fuzzy, apparently intended to create a dream-like image, but most of the visuals are clear, and the general picture quality and sound of this disc are excellent. Interesting program notes fill in the background of this unique production which is certainly a welcome addition to the Schumann catalogue.",1321488000,7,4078,4.879884225759769
8462796,4,B00596767A,"Robert Schumann had been exposed to Lord Byron's epic poem ""Manfred"" when the composer was a teenager and the implicit angst and call to self discovery within the story appealed to the young Schumann. When Schumann was older, as an adult in his early thirties, it is known that he met and was intrigued by Franz Liszt who, in turn, was taken with the works of Byron and other literary giants of the time. Schumann's 'gesamtkunstwerk' (a ""complete"" art work) has never received many performances in its original guise, as a nearly evening long music drama for actors, chorus and orchestra. This new DVD of a 2010 performance from the Tonhalle Dusseldorf is visually stunning and gives us a very contemporized glimpse at what Schumann intended. The ""staging"" here is minimalist but effective in the ultra-modern confines of the Tonhalle. Film director and visualist Johannes Deutsch creates what is basically a slide show with computer generated castle mounts, mountain scenery and cathedral-like arches onto which live camera footage of the actor Johnann von Bulow as Manfred is projected. Von Bulow performs off stage and his task is spoken melodrama of Byron's words, as edited and borrowed by Schumann. In point of fact, the real boon in this performance is that of von Bulow. As he recites the words of the 19th century romantic Count Manfred, in his railings against the futility of existence diametrically pondered against the possibilities of man and even some suicidal threats, von Bulow struggles, sweats, nearly screaming (well, actually shouting out many times) in a tour de force of recitation. The philosopher's muse, Astarte and his devil's advocate or 'geist' are also well played by Tina Amonson and Stefan Wilkening respectively. The Dusseldorf Symphony under Andrey Boreyko plays wonderfully. Some viewers will have heard ""Manfred"" in its more often performed orchestral suite or in selections. Film maker Johannes Deutsch's vision is a little abstract, not literal. and the very nature of the performance is something that very few are familiar with. The scope and structure of Schumann's ""Manfred"" make it too unusual, too dependent on dramatic forces to get it the amount of play that it, perhaps, deserves. This performance is excellent and worthwhile. It is a work for - basically - actor and orchestra. Viewers should approach it patiently; this is neither opera nor oratorio. If you become immersed in the look and the unbelievably manic work by Johann von Bulow you will find it well worth your while.",1316995200,12,2526,5.103864734299517
