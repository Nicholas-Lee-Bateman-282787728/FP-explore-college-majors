8587149,1,B00CX7AN7I,"Perhaps the most biased of all of the great course. Whenever Churchill was removed from a position according to Fears it was due to jealousy. But with so much jealousy how did he win the appointment to begin with? Churchill rode a daring escape as a POW to incredible fame, and the inside track to many opportunities. To his credit he was one of the first to recognize the threat of Hitler, and to his great glory he was likely the best person to lead Britain through the war. Then due to his unpopular political beliefs and rigid, out-dated thinking he was quickly voted out at war's end. After hearing a comment by Fears regarding Churchill before relying on it you must do some more research.",1525737600,,695,4.523809523809524
8587150,5,B00CX7AN7I,"There is much here to praise,as Rufus Fears delivers an excellent and comprehensive look at the life of Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill. It is such a praiseworthy accomplishment that I thought that the word ""friend"" came from Winston Churchill. Winston Churchill made a difference and such a difference that something of both ""Brotherhood"" and ""Statesmen"" were integral to knowing the life of Winston Churchill. The two disc plus book presentation was very useful. The book served as a guide with extensive questions provided at the end of every chapter. The book was  an  in depth history presentation which you will get tested on, it was that interesting. Winston Churchill was a great friend to the American people. It was useful in its own right to know  that John Fitzgerald Kennedy as President of the United States bestowed upon Winston Churchill a designation of American Citizen. There are not many individuals whose life can be compared as he was involved, really involved. He was very successful even terribly successful. Books,Painting, there seems not a limit on just how much of a success  an individual can become because Winston Churchill seems to be it. This is simply put a very excellent presentation worth the time and effort to know this man in Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill and worth the time and effort to know this work of Rufus Fears in ""Great Courses"" series. Most Recommended !",1515196800,,1410,5.012820512820513

8587153,5,B00CX7AN7I,I really like Winston Churchill. I also like the late Professor Fears. He is an admirer of Mr. Churchill and it shows but he is also fair. Some really good info presented in a good fashion. I would order it again.,1467676800,5,213,4.219512195121951
8587154,5,B00CX7AN7I,"Very pro Churchill as other reviewers have said, but having said that it was still an interesting listen. The author often pointed out alternative points of view during the lectures, even though he admittedly chose the more favorable option himself. The accompanying handbook was useful.",1465776000,8,287,5.4
