4829052,5,B005LDH3M4,"I am currently doing Insanity, just started this week.  Today is my day off, hadn't tried this video yet and thought it would be a nice change of pace from Insanity and I could still get in a workout on my rest day.  This video is very challenging... but it is up to you how far you take yourself.  Angie gives you at least 3 options for each exercise and will even give a 4th at times.  You can and are encouraged to modify if you need to, there is no reason to give up... because you can do each move.  I completed circuit one and I am dripping with sweat, and I feel I am an avid exerciser and in pretty good shape.  The circuits are nice and compact, so you can fit it into a busy schedule, which is a lot like Jillian Michael's 30 day shred.  But, I find Angie to have a much better personality and attitude than Jillian.  The people working out with Angie are not fitness models, they are real people.  The video quality is not what you will find with a Beachbody video, but with her ability and instruction and personality, she's well on her way.

One of my favorite things about the dvd is that if you only have 5 minutes to workout, you can go to the main menu and select a specific exercise to only do abs, or legs, arms... whatever you need.  Every little bit counts, and when you have little children and a busy day, it's hard sometimes to give yourself that time to take care of yourself.",1334448000,,1401,4.151851851851852
4829053,4,B005LDH3M4,"Another great video from Angie.  I enjoyed her first video but found that I mostly did the weight section for a good strength workout using lighter weights I have at home.

This one is challenging but enjoyable.  I wanted to think I could do level 3 on each exercise but had to move between all of them at different points so it was good to have all the options shown to you.  I was glad that she also had a good amount of light weight work to mix in and the exercises were different then the other video.

The only thing lacking is the production quality and timing but it is still a great workout to mix in and I think her videos will only get better with time, experience and budget.",1323216000,,686,4.166666666666667
4829054,5,B005LDH3M4,I did the 3 circuit workout yesterday for the first time and wow my muscles are burning today! It really targets the areas everyone wants to work on and the availability to customize to your fitness level make this DVD a go-to! The circuits and the way it is all timed keep you focused and not bored- it didn't feel like an hour at all! I will definitely keep up with this program!,1321401600,,381,4.232876712328767
4829055,4,B005LDH3M4,I am a fitness instructor and have tried many work out DVDs and I really enjoyed this one.  I love how customizable the workout is by allowing you to select the number of circuits you want to do or even the exact moves you want to tackle.  Plus Angie offers 3 different levels of each move so that EVERYONE can get a great workout!!  I thought she was very engaging and gave some great cueing.  The work out was challenging - I did all 3 circuits and I can really feel it in my legs and its only been about 2 hours!  I would definitely recommend this for any fitness level.  The only critique I had of the DVD is that I think Angie should be a little more descriptive with some of the moves - although I knew the moves someone who is just starting out in fitness might need a bit more help to get the proper form.,1319846400,,813,4.05
4829056,5,B005LDH3M4,"This DVD makes it really easy to get a great all-over body workout. I love the three different levels and I often find myself switching between them depending on my energy level. Even if I work at the low-impact level, it's still an awesome workout. I really feel it the next day in my arms and glutes! Angie keeps me motivated and makes the program exciting. If you are looking to get your entire body in shape, this DVD will do it!",1319846400,,433,4.2926829268292686
4829057,5,B005LDH3M4,"Angie has such a wonderful energy in her teaching style throughout this video. Logistically, I like that her video has seperate menu choices to either do the full circuit or to just select a body part if you wish. As a professional massage therapist I personally appreciate that she has a safety section covering the basics of good form for her viewers to prevent injury. The format of the workouts were easy to follow yet allowed for a variety of levels to work at. It's a great workout for anyone else out there who gets bored quickly. The circuits will have you moving from one to the next before you even have a chance! A well thought out video...",1319587200,,651,4.4789915966386555
4829058,5,B005LDH3M4,"All I can say about this workout is WOW!!! I have numerous workout videos and this one is by far one of my favorite!!!  I like how there is three 20 minute circuits so if you do not have an hour then you can just do one of the workouts which is nice if your on the go or have a crazy work schedule. It has a great variety of arm, ab, lower body and cardio workouts so you do not feel like you are repeating the same motions, and what else is great is there are three different levels so if your looking to start working out or are bored with the same workout routine and are looking for a change then this video is a MUST!!!  This video will definately be a part of my weekly workout routine and I am hoping Angie will bring other great videos like this one in the future!!!!",1318982400,,775,3.9615384615384617
4829059,5,B005LDH3M4,"I liked Angie's 50/50 video so much i had to order this one. I have been able to do it a few times now and it is just as good, if not better, than the first. It's set up sort of like 30 day Shred by Jillian Michaels, but it's more customizable--which is the best part about these videos--and the moves are a bit more unique. I'll definitely have to work my way up to doing level 3 for all 3 circuits because doing that is INTENSE, so on some of the moves i have to drop down to level 2 or 1. The other day i only had a few minutes to squeeze in a workout before work, so i just did the first circuit at level 3. I was relieved to realize that i still sweat my butt off and got a total body workout just doing one circuit (about 20 min) because finding time to work out is my biggest challenge. Anyway-- highly recommend! I will be getting married soon and these two videos are going to be my saving grace to help me handle my wedding planning stress AND get me into tip top shape for my wedding!",1317168000,7,995,3.9306930693069306
4829060,5,B005LDH3M4,"I have purchased both of Angie's video.  The first has sections for cardio and sections for weights.  This video puts it all together.  It is a bit tougher than the first one, but to have the cario and the weights mixed makes it just as good.  Be prepared for a great workout.",1316822400,,276,4.25
8478089,5,B005LDH3M4,great thanks,1429660800,,12,5.5
8478090,2,B005LDH3M4,26YO consider myself advanced exerciser love HIIT training was excited about this DVD since thought level 3 would be a great work. I bought it since recommended as great/hard work out on a personal trainers list....but it's only a couple minutes of cardio and then weight and abs make up a major portion of the DVD... So I was very disappointed. I wanted a lot more cardio and this DVD did not provide this. Don't get me wrong the weights and and are great! But overall not a great cardio workout and not what I was looking for,1425772800,,527,4.387755102040816
8478091,5,B005LDH3M4,"I love how she utilizes 3 other women who do the workout at the 3 different levels at the same time because I can easily switch from one to the other depending on the move and follow that person. Also, there are no fancy outfits, background and crazy moves nor wasted video showing the workout persons face when I really need to see the moves. I became a fan of hers after purchasing the first DVD.",1413849600,,398,4.25
8478092,3,B005LDH3M4,"Angie moves too fast for me.  The video has 3 girls doing the different stages, beginner, intermediate and advanced.  Very confusing the first time I exercised to it.  It is my least favorite of all my excercise videos.  I excercise 5 or 6 days a week and am 62 and I use a different tape every day.  I don't use this one but about every 2 weeks.",1366416000,,346,4.104477611940299
8478093,5,B005LDH3M4,"I love these routines and the ability to customize it to your level.  This has been my savior for winter exercise especially since I am a full time working mother of a toddler and in school part time.  I am always able to squeeze in at least one circuit.  I love that it concentrates on all the problem areas that we experience as we get older.  I am looking forward to being strong and more cut once summer comes!  I already notice that my arms are more defined after 2 weeks.  I have not built up to level 3 or circuit 3 yet, but I plan to work on it.",1358208000,4,553,3.981818181818182
8478094,5,B005LDH3M4,"I was a huge fan of Angie's first 50/50 Workout DVD so I picked this one up and she knocked it out of the park again!  I think her exercises are more organzied and easier to customize than any other interval circuit DVD I have tried and I get a great workout every time.  Thank you, Angie!",1350691200,3,289,4.052631578947368
8478095,3,B005LDH3M4,"This is a good workout, but in the end it's just another dance routine. I have bad knees and this will just make them worse.",1348790400,,124,4.0
8478096,5,B005LDH3M4,"Well. What can I say? I love to work out, and I love a challenge. And that is what you get with this DVD. Cardio, with abs, and strength. There are 3 levels to choose from, so even a beginner can work out to this and work their way up. As far as Angie Gorr; I like her. I like that she's not real ""cutesy"". Just right to the point, but not in an in-your-face kind of way. I have a lot of work out DVD's and I can tell I will be using this one a lot.
Another thing, I really think the interval training is most effective when trying to lose weight and get into shape. But I also find it really fun. It's hard, yes. No doubt. But it's fun, and goes by fairly quickly.

And to everyone with a step; she has a step option, which I really love! I've had my step for a long time and kind of put it away. I was glad to bring it back out!",1348617600,,830,3.742857142857143
8478097,5,B005LDH3M4,"Both of the Angie Gorr videos have floated to the top of my large stack of workout DVDs. I really like the brisk pace and the variety. I finished P90X and usually exercise four times per week using my favorite P90X videos along with a mix of Bob Harper and Jillian Michaels DVDs.

You have to identify with the person doing the training and Angie is the most upbeat and the best at demonstrating and calling out the moves (Bob trying to act more macho and Jillian trying to act less macho get a little bit tiresome at times, but both have good programs). Angie uses normal-looking people who do all three levels at the same time, so you can switch among levels when you need to.

I firmly believe that circuit workouts deliver the biggest bang for the time spent, covering both cardio and strength in a single 40-minute workout. 20 minute workouts don't seem worth the trouble of changing clothes, but the 60-minute variety sometimes drag on inefficiently with endless stretching, breaks, and cool-downs.

Men might be predisposed to think of exercise DVDs featuring women to be good only for women, but not so. I do all Level 3 on both of Angie's DVDs and use 10-pound weights and I sweat and huff plenty.

My favorite DVDs other than Angie's, by the way, are Bob's Pure Burn Super Strength, Bob's Biggest Loser Boot Camp, Jillian's No More Trouble Zones, and Jillian's Banish Fat Boost Metabolism. All of these deliver a serious workout using nothing more than light weights and a mat. For men who are in pretty good shape, just push yourself harder, do the highest level exercises in the programs, and use heavier weights (again, 10-pounders push me exactly hard enough to feel the burn).",1347494400,,1691,4.6644295302013425
8478098,5,B005LDH3M4,"I bought this and the 50/50 workout DVD together. Both are terrific. I work out every day, rotating among yoga, walking and circuit training. I used to do the workouts on the now defunct ""Exercise TV"".  Angie Gorr is as good as the trainers they used to feature, and there were some big names. I hope she finds success with her DVDs.

The format lets you be flexible in terms of time, type of exercise, and intensity.  You can get a fantastic workout without being required to risk injury. Angie provides excellent instruction.  She is personable, articulate, well-trained and positive. It has  a bit of a step class feel to it, but I quickly got past that.",1341100800,,657,4.581196581196581
