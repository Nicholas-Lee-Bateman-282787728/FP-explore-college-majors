8471760,4,B005GKAELY,"I would rate this movie 3.5 stars but since they don't do half - I gave it four stars. Several things about this movie- I really loved the opening credits and the art work that went behind it. It was very cool. The music in the movie was fun too. The movie in general was a lot of fun. The killings were over the top fake which made it laugh out loud funny in several parts. This movie is not going for an oscar nomination but if you have the right type of sense of humor you will get this movie. I thought Nelson Oliver did a great job as the bipolar elf. I think the over the top laughter could have been toned down some. I thought it was hilarious sometimes when he would just appear and make faces without the noises. David Hawkins who played Santa was also very funny since everything he does as a Santa is so wrong which makes the movie so right. Couple of things, I will agree that the stare down contest in several scenes got a little old and found myself fast forwarding at times. I also thought the scene with the mother and father was very awkward. I thought the mother did a great job but the throwing up forever seemed to get old pretty quickly and I find myself fast forwarding during a lot of that main scene in the kitchen except for when the two guys appear who are also very funny. Some of the kill scenes in this movie made me laugh hard. I loved when Santa and the elf drag the guy behind the truck all over the place on roller skates- this was just plain fun. Overall, I would watch this movie again and again just because it was very humourous. The beginning and ending credits are excellent. I am not sure if Cullen did those  himself but they were outstanding. I also really enjoyed all the music in this movie for being very original. If anything, this movies is original. If you love black comedy and don't take movies with the name Slaughter Claus too seriously then you will enjoy this one.",1326412800,3,1918,4.226158038147139
8471761,1,B005GKAELY,"This is by far one of the worst attempts of a slasher flick I have EVER seen! I have seen thousands of horror flicks and this is by far one of the worst out there. This movie HAS ABSOLUTELY NO PLOT!! The gore FX are bad, the acting is horrible, the edits are bad, the script is that of a 12 year old, the music sucks, the audio is distorted in spots, and I could go on & on & on & on & on & on. The only good thing this movie has going for it is ""the cover art"". The annoying, evil side-kick elf does not make this movie any better either. What the hell is up with the LONG periods of silence/camera shots from the actors? Literally, the camera is on the actors face for long periods of time with no action, they say nothing! Ultra boring with agony to the eyes!! The only part of this movie I liked was the dog & he didn't say anything. I have never seen any of Cullen's movies before and do not know if I would check out another flick made by this guy. I always give second chances to directors for their movies and if the 2nd one is a piece of crap then that director is blacklisted from my movie library or viewing privilege. Nothing they produce will cross my eyes again. The director had some good ideas in this film but he does not know how to execute them properly. With some proper schooling in film, I could see this director making a half way decent film but until then, I say ""stay far away from Cullen's films"".  If there is one movie by Cullen's you horror fans could recommend then please do recommend it, I refuse to spend another dime on trash such as Slaughter Clause. I literally grabbed my bone scissors and cut the DVD in half & threw this piece of waste into my trash can. I don't even want dumpster divers to see this trash. I want the 74 minutes back that this movie stole from me. This is not even a bad movie that is good, BAD is BAD & this is a poor attempt for a slasher/horror flick. 2 bloody thumbs down.... WAY DOWN!!!!! Schroeder (Publisher/Owner) of Cult Movies Magazine & TV",1325894400,3,2008,4.122448979591836
8471762,1,B005GKAELY,"This movie is not like all the other Christmas Horror movies at all. It is not interesting, very boring, has awful editing, etc. The movie's runtime is only 74 minutes, but they have long strange 2 minute pauses in quite a few different scenes where someone just stares for almost two minutes without even speaking. It is very strange, annoying, and unnecessary. This just dosen't happen once either. Many, Many times. If you would take out all the pauses, this movie probably would last 57 minutes. Even then, it would be 57 minutes of agony, because none of the movie is good. It's not the fact that this movie is low budget, because there are alot of good low budget films. This movie is so bad, that when I watched it, I listed it on ebay immediately after viewing it to get rid of this stinker & get my money back before the bad reviews came out.",1323475200,4,851,4.426751592356688

I've been trying to think of a clever way to describe Slaughter Claus without making it sound so bad. I can't. It's the most atrocious, worthless piece of crap I've ever seen. Also, I loved every minute. If you've never seen a film by Charles E. Cullen before, then you can't really grasp the concept. It's like low-budget sketch comedy that middle-schoolers would post to youtube, except not as good.
