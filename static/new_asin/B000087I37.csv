1829240,3,B000087I37,"The movie starts with a 1969 flashback before the credits. Any horror mystery watcher worth their salt know who the killer is before the credits is over. It is just a matter of figuring out which person that is years later. 10 minutes into the movie, you should know why they are killing. It is just that predictable.

Knife stabs- When you play the Psycho sound track and make cartoonish squishy sounds with each plunge are we to assume this is a comedy?

The killer sends Dennis Hopper a post card and calls him at home. Apparently the killer knows him. He gives Hopper the first clue...""I'll leave the light on for you."" Immediately our minds race...Is it Tom Bodett?

There is an Internet game being played called the Prophet Game, based on  kid's game I was not aware existed. The game consists of riddles and players are pitted against each other. Patrick Thomas, an admirer of Curly plays a character reminiscent of the more disgusting Curly Joe.

Dennis Hopper plays Swan a retired detective who is helping the LAPD find the copy cat serial killer who kidnaps the losers in the game and kills them along with celebrities. Overly predictable. The clues apply to fictional characters the audience doesn't know so you can't play along.

1829241,5,B000087I37,"A fairly good suspense film, even a thriller, with a serial killer who comes back after having died on the scene of his last or latest crime. And he gets into a new series. We know from the very start who the killer or killers is or are. But we will only understand that very beginning at the end. It is a game among anonymous people with enigmas and riddles that prophesies the next victim. If you want the next victim to be saved you have to give the solution to the latest riddle you received. Of course the game is rigged. The killer gets some guarantee by menacing the players with some reprisal on some close relatives or friends. Of course the object of the game is to bring the cop who put an end to the first series of serial killings into the game to get some kind of vengeance. It's well done and it shoots in all directions with a few elements that will not get explained here and there. The riddles are obscure and the explanations are too quick for us to wonder what it really means and how they manage to get the solutions. We can also wonder how this killer can single-handedly kidnap or abduct an adult. But I guess everything has to remain slightly mysterious. The happy ending is of course very optimistic. The killer could have done a lot more damage if the end had not been too vain and had only considered vengeance. That killer being insane, definitely schizophrenic, does not explain why in the last moments of the adventure criminal reason departs and vanity takes over. But that's good entertainment.

1829242,3,B000087I37,"The world seems to be separated into two groups of people.... those who like Dennis Hopper and those who don't. I am from the former rather than the latter so whenever he turns up in something new in theaters or on DVD, I check it out. Prophet's game, for some reason, is one movie that I didn't know about in its original release. If we are to believe there are as many serial killers out there as hollywood wishes for us to believe, society as a whole is in trouble. Sick of the serial killer movies as I am, I must say that Prophet's game is a very taut and well done movie overall, and that's great considering it was a straight to DVD release. Direction is good and the acting is also good, but the story could have used one more rewrite before going celluloid. Thats not to say the writing is bad, but some dialogue is questionable as is the case with many low budget films. Predictability wise, even fans of the genre will be surprised with the ending as it didn't end the way I predicted, and that alone almost merits another star in the rating. The reason I find it difficult to tack on one more star is the lack of star power other than Dennis Hopper. He really is a terrific everyman actor who deserves at least 1 more similar high caliber actor to play off of. I suppose though that I should be happy that Hopper is part of the cast at all as nowadays many of these features are hitting the video store shelves with nothing but no namers. Indeed, without Hopper, Prophet's game might have been a completely dismissable film, but with his charisma, it is elevated to a higher level, so kudos to the filmmakers for recognizing their movie needed Hopper. If you're not completely worn out from too many serial killer movies, go ahead and test run Prophet's game. Its a good thriller to use as a follow up to Seven or Kiss the Girls or Along came a spider or Saw or Bone Collector or Jill the Ripper or.....",1183507200,2,1915,4.322222222222222

1829280,4,B000087I37,"Released in 2000 and directed by David Worth, ""The Prophets Game"" is a crime/thriller starring Dennis Hopper as Vincent Swan, a retired detective from Seattle who is asked to fly to Los Angeles to help solve a new rash of murders similar to a case he supposedly solved a dozen years earlier. Stephanie Zimbalist co-stars as ""Al,"" a frustrated officer assigned to keep an eye on Swan while Joe Penny plays the hardboiled chief of detectives. Robert Yocum, Shannon Whirry, Greg Lauren, Michael Dorn and Sondra Locke are also on hand.

While this went straight-to-video in the USA & most other countries it had a theatrical release in Spain and Korea. Having a more modest budget than feature thrillers, it lacks the polish of the similarly themed ""The Dead Pool"" (1988), not to mention it lacks a super-cop like Dirty Harry and the corresponding fast action, although it has some action. What ""The Prophet's Game"" has in its favor is an impressive character-driven script by Carol Chrest only hampered by convolution. On top of this you have zesty performances by all the principle cast members. Both Swan and Al are nicely fleshed-out and you care about them and the outcome of the story. Penny and Locke also give knockout performances, although their roles are relatively minor. Shannon Whirry shines as one of the most beautiful women to walk the earth in a peripheral part.

This is an R-rated flick and therefore contains cussing, gruesome gore and female top-nudity, but none of these are overdone. Some people don't like it because of the limitations of its modest budget, but I was nicely entertained from beginning to end. You'll probably like it too if you favor dialogue-driven stories and don't insist on blockbuster budgets. I wouldn't want to pay top dollar to see it at the theater, but it works well for TV, DVD or rental.

AN INQUIRY: There's a scene well into the second half where Swan (Hopper) is walking with two other characters through a campus and a few extras pass between the camera and them. One is a woman wearing white pants who is talking to another person. She is seen again in the same sequence in the background. I need to know who this woman in white pants is. I presume she's an extra provided by the casting agency that hired extras for the movie. I must see more of this actress; it's of the utmost importance.

The movie runs 106 minutes and was shot in Ventura and Santa Barbara, California.

I'd put Blue Velvet in the ""gems"" category; Prophet's Game is Number One on the list of stinkers. Everything about this show, from the plot to the acting to the lighting and sound, is utterly terrible. Stephanie Zimbalist provides a bit of brightness to the film just because she's Stephanie Zimbalist.
