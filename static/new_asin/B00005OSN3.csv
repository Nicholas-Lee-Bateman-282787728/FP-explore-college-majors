The story is simple and a bit predictable, but the acting is decent and if you are a Holt McCallany fan like I am, you will love him in this one, especially the way he looks: absolutely sexy!",1175126400,,385,4.5
1641793,3,B00005OSN3,"Intrigued by Holt McCallany in CSI:Miami, I have been on a quest to find other works by him.  This is definitely not his best.  The acting is contrived and the plot is old and not well executed (parole officer falls for ex-con who's out of prison and trying to settle a score).  If you are looking for good movies with Holt in them, try Below or The Fight Club.  If you insist on buying this movie, make sure you buy a bottle of Electric Reindeer White Zinfadel (or another alcoholic substitute--I was in the holiday spirit at the time).  The alcohol will help you make it through to the end.  Sorry, Holt!",1071100800,7,606,4.366071428571429
