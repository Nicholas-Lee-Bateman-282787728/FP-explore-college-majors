8251526,4,B0013K2YNW,"I must confess, I haven't yet watched all 8 of these (yet)

If one grows tired of 90 minute or 2 hour or 2.5 hour movies, an alternative is to watch short films, such as this collection.  I read that they ranged from 5 to 15 minutes; actually I think the longest was 21 minutes and I didn't finish it yet.

Like the comparison between novels and short stories, short films and movies have little in common except the use of the same medium.  The goals and means for achieving them must be substantially different.  This is a collection of short films which won awards at film festivals including: Toronto, Vancouver, L.A. Shorts, Stuttgard, Young Digital Creators, Clermont-Ferrand, Calgary, Seattle, Mieres, Dresden, Tehran, and Cannes.  That's 12 festivals and there are only 8 short films, so obviously some won multiple awards.

I watched (so far) almost 6 of the 8 and would only call some of them ""fair"".  Out of the six I saw, my favorite was only 5
minutes long and from France, titled ""The Dance Lesson"".  This is a one-person act; no animation or special effects (except
a bit of strobe lighting).  It begins looking like anything but a dance lesson, and in fact rather boring and absurd.  By the
time it is over, I think most viewers will have radically changed their minds.

No two films are from the same director nor have anything like the same presentation.  There's sure to be a few you would enjoy, and some you can skip.",1415491200,4,1438,4.592156862745098
8251527,4,B0013K2YNW,"I use this in a film class I teach. The short DIAMONDS is a great example of a rotten short. NO BIKINI is alone worth the price. Interesting fact: all these shorts are NON-USA shorts (Canada, France, Germany, etc.) so it is a neat international perspective. BUY",1401321600,2,261,4.574468085106383
8251528,1,B0013K2YNW,"I ordered this because I wanted the short ""Love and War"" -- which is fabulous, by the way.  Looking up that short took me to this collection which I assumed included that short.  No!  And furthermore, the quality of these films was soporific.  It's in the  recycle bin.",1362873600,,269,4.520833333333333
8251529,5,B0013K2YNW,"(Porno) I like this short little movie.  I don't really understand the title. The title makes it a b@$ch to find without bringing up all sorts of trash on my computer. It's about a teenage girl who seeks affection from boys in the entirely wrong way. She moves to a new apartment building and focuses on one particular,  quiet boy.  Interestingly, he's not that into her very forward approach.  It makes you want a sequel to see how things might have developed between them. This was the only movie I was interested in watching in this compilation.",1353628800,,548,4.618556701030927
8251530,5,B0013K2YNW,"Visually stunning, with a heart warming message that will literally lift one's spirit. It will appeal to kids and adults alike.",1325635200,,127,5.095238095238095
8251531,5,B0013K2YNW,This is a solid short. It's well done and pretty funny. There's no reason not to spend five minutes watching this.,1318377600,,114,4.476190476190476
8251532,5,B0013K2YNW,"It's pretty much as the synopsis tells it--a 15 minute, animated opera, sung in Italian with English subtitles, performed by animal puppets. Sexy nurse (bunny) waits for fighter-pilot boyfriend (bear) to come home from WWII. By far the weirdest thing I've seen on the internet this week.",1316995200,,287,5.127659574468085
8251533,4,B0013K2YNW,"I feel lucky to find these at my local library. I love short films, and these movies are hard to get unless you buy them. I have seen a handful of the Film Movement films, and they are always excellent.

I didn't like all of the short films, but 5 out of 8 is not bad! They range from 5 to 15 minutes, and they are filmed all over the world. My favorites were:

Aided Migration- An animated story about a bird who isn't well enough to migrate, so he has to take a plane, but it goes the wrong way. Lucky for him, a vengeful animal in disguise has a plan.

The Sickie- A dedicated, hard-working man takes care of everything (and everyone) in the office, but he needs a break, so he decides to call in a ""sickie."" Can he actually stay away?

Man in the Moon- Another fun animated film where a man who lives on the moon realizes that he will have some visitors very soon.

A Half Man- This one was a little depressing, but very strange and interesting. A man with only half of his body (animated) does his best to work and take care of his little girl, without letting his body parts fall out.

The Great Zambini-  A man, who used to be in the circus, tries to win back the affection of his son. It appears to be filmed in Spain, but you would never know it, because there are only 2-3 words spoken throughout. The sign of a great story is that there is no need for the characters to speak, because they show you everything, not tell. This one was my favorite.

The other three films were pretty good, but I liked these the most. Well worth a viewing. Recommended!",1226966400,11,1561,4.162790697674419
8251534,5,B0013K2YNW,"I generally like Film Movement selections and these shorts were first of the kind I saw offered to the public.  I decided to try them, since they are compilation of the 8 (eight) short movies from various short film festivals in Europe and North America.  Some of the films are animations, some are computer graphics and others are just great short stories interestingly setup.  The absolute best of all is the film called ""Dance Lessons"" by a French director.  It has not a single spoken word in it but will make you laugh all the way.  The second one I like most is the short British film called ""Sickie"" about overworked and under-appreciated office worked who decides to take a sick day off until he realizes that VIP will not get all his servcies in order for that day unless he personally takes care of it.  The music in ""Sickie"" is absolutely great.  And the next one I really liked was animated movie abnout bird's migration.  What is bird to do if he cannot fly to the warm climate?  Totally cute one.  The selection is very interesting and the thought process behind these short muvies in deep, not accidendal.  Do not think that because these films are short that they were slapped on quickly without serious effort.  To the contrary, these young directors have said a lot with only 5 minutes of time alloted to them.  But the ""Dance Lesson"" is movie no one can forget - ever!!",1213574400,3,1388,4.548387096774194
