Sophia is still as beautiful as she was then, but there was nothing gripping about this movie that has not be done before.  The voices do not match the lip movements (so I am not sure if the original was in italian and this version was dubbed-- seems like it).  The person playing the daughter was obviously too old for the role and it made her seem ""slow"" rather than vulerably young and innocent.

736831,5,6303934315,Great neo-realist telling of the myth of women which involves hardship in war and bonding. Loren is more than adequate as a sexy woman who cares about her innocent child. Most of the film centers around her interaction with the Italian country people who forge a bond with each other under fascist harassment. The last scene in the film is powerful because it shows a mother and her daughter in close moments which center around forgiveness.,1389139200,,441,4.815789473684211
736832,1,6303934315,"Having purchased over 1000 movies from Amazon in the past ten years, I believe I have earned the right to call attention to an ever-growing problem on this site, which is, if you're going to offer a product, you need to do due diligence in verifying the authenticity of it....
Specifically, if there are several versions of a film being offered, you need to pinpoint more accurately what each version actually contains, not what the package claims it contains, and thus to the point....
The Turner Classic Movie channel recently aired ""Two Women"" or La Ciociara..the picture was STUNNINGLY PERFECT...images were clear & crisp, subtitles easy to read and did not detract from viewing.  ""well!"" I exclaimed to myself ""now, at last, it's time to buy!"" Since the picture was so flawless, I thought there might be a Criterion Collection version out there...In performing my search on Amazon, I was confronted with six or seven choices of the product.  I had read the numerous reviews submitted about the poor quality of the film, and Amazon's various selections did not offer any advice toward pointing this customer in the right direction--price didn't matter, this is a film that I've long wanted to add to my collection...so I went for this version...'LA CIOCIARA (ENHANCED) 1960...and on the product description, ""digitally enhanced for better picture quality..."" Let me tell what I got:
Somebody took what looks like an old vhs tape of the film, DVR'd it to multiple recorders at once, slapped on some english dialogue, so you never hear the voices of those who acted in it, clipped the film to 2:35 to 1 aspect ratio (not the way it was filmed)and offered this drivle up as a ""collector's edition""...The images of what i did see were so poor, were I not already familiar with Sophia Loren, I would not even recognize her....And on a big screen HDTV system? A HORROR movie!  I Feel VIOLATED!!  Ladies & Gentlemen, DO NOT PURCHASE ANY VERSION OF THIS FILM UNTIL, in the product description area, you see a line indicating THIS IS THE VERSION THAT AIRED ON THE TCM CHANNEL! And Amazon?

736834,4,6303934315,"I've been a fan of Sophia Loren since I was a kid. Her sexy and exotic looks are one of kind. She is one of the most beautiful women every to have graced the cinema.
I think of Loren has as a romantic comedy actress, although I know she has done many dramatic roles Usually in the dramatic roles, Loren is the romantic partner for the male lead but in TWO WOMEN, she is the star. This is her movie and no doubt it was a role of a lifetime. It's clear why she  won the Academy Award for Best Actress.

In TWO WOMEN, we see not only Loren's stunning beauty but also her remarkable beauty. Loren stars as the feisty and independent Cesira. The young widow runs a small grocery store in war-torn Rome.  Cesira is trying to give her 13 year old daughter Rosetta a normal life despite the regular arial bombings and dangers. Finally a bomb strikes too close to the shop and Cesira decides that the countryside would be safer. She and Rosetta embark on a hourney to the safety of her small childhood village near Naples.

We see the horrors of war on innocent civilians as the pair head south by train and then on foot. There is danger around every corner. Cities are bombed out and civilians are doing whatever they can to survive. No worries for tough Cesira. No one will hard her or her daughter. Eventually they find safety in the mountains near her village with people she knows.

One of the refugees is Michele played by French actor Jean-Paul Belmondo. Michele (pronounced Me KEL A in Italian) is an idealistic young man who like many falls for the beautiful Cesira. He professes his love for Cesira, but what does fate have in store for them?

I knew what the main premise of the story was and what happens to the ""two women"", but that incident comes very late in the movie and it is distburbing and heartbreaking. I had heard so much about that part of the story that it to all happen much earlier. This is a story of survival and a young mother's determination to protect her child. Loren shows her amazing acting ability in this once-in-a lifetime role.

Like other reviewers, I have to take note of the particularly bad quality of this DVD. The cover shows a sultry Sophia Loren when most covers and pictures I have seen show her in the agony of war.  The video and audio qualities of this version were very substandard. I'm referring to the version listed as coming from Pro-Active Entertainment Group. The quality was almost unbearable and I am sorry it destroyed the artistry of the film. This is definitely not the version to buy if you are serious about film.",1331510400,,2569,4.439490445859873

736858,4,6303934315,"This is a dark portrait of how war affects people and communities. From the beginning when we see bombings destroying homes in Rome all the way to the end of the film constantly shows us the destructiveness of war. The main character, Cesira, abandons Rome taking her daughter Rosetta with her and goes to the village where Rosetta was born. During their stay in the village we see how everyone in the community has been reduced to the most basic needs because of the war. They have to think only about food and staying alive. Cesira and Rosetta also meets a young intellectual in this community, Michell. He represents innocence and hope. He believes that the world will change for good after the war. He also falls in love with Cesira, but she refuses to accept his advances because he is too idealistic for her taste. Later on, Michel is chosen by a group of Nazi soldiers to lead them through the mountains and gets killed. Cesira and Rosetta have to return to Rome when it is clear that the war is approaching its end, but they get raped in an abandoned church by soldiers who are clearly mercenaries that work for the Allied troops. This is the most shocking scene of all. With the rape, Cesira faces the reality that no one can escape from the destructiveness of war. Her daughter has lost her innocence in spite of all her attempts to protect her from the violence of the world. It is also interesting that this scene takes place in a church, which gives this tragic scene a greater meaning. The war is so pervasive that it filters through everywhere, leaving no human institution untouched. Also noticeable through the film is that we don't know exactly who is attacking or bombing. We get to see English soldiers, German soldiers, American troops, and even a Russian deserter, but the film presents them in an objective way. The film focuses on how people get affected by the war: people are dislocated from their communities, homeless, hungry, and have little time for the everyday rituals that keep people together. The scene where Michell tries to read the Bible story
about Lazarus and then walks out in anger because the people are not really paying attention to him shows clearly how the war makes people think about basic needs. The most shocking scene is the one showing a mad woman holding one of her breasts and offering milk.

Although the DVD quality is not as great as a remastered version, the picture is good enough. It is enough for me to view and listen to the story. There is not one scene that I cannot understand. I had seen this film when I was an adolescent, and I am glad to have the opportunity to watch it again.",1310947200,2,2647,4.572631578947369

This ""collector's edition"" released by Big D Productions is just another awful video and audio transfer like all of the others.  The picture quality is so blurry you can't even make out facial features when the characters are filmed at a distance.  Audio is even more attrocious, as once again the movie has been released with the bad english overdubbing instead of the original italian language track with the english subtitles.  So far, the only time I have gotten to see this wonderful film in all it's beautiful glory is when I catch it playing on the Turner Movie Classics channel on TV.  Maybe one day someone will be able to use their print of this film to make a decent DVD transfer.  Until then, this copy I bought will be added to the pile of other bad copies I have been fooled into buying, and I will have to check the cable guide to see when TCM is replaying this classic so I can enjoy ""Two Women"", and won't cringe every other second while watching it!!!",1257292800,3,1083,4.444444444444445
736861,5,6303934315,"Mrs. Loren who is still a sex symbol at her age, was the first actress to win an Oscar for a foreign language film with this movie.  The story is simple and elegant.  Loren and her daughter, played by Eleanore Brown have to leave Rome becuase it is being bomed by the Allies as it is occupied by the Nazi's.  The political situation is messed up and Mussolini is overthrown.  The Nazi's send in troops to meet the Allies at Salerno and a 21 day battle ensues (you can watch a great movie about this battle in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Walk-In-The-Sun/dp/B002FY7WSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Walk In The Sun</a>).

This movie isn't about the war tough, it's about these two women surviving all of the horror that comes along with it.  These Two Women (La Ciociara) endure hardship and horror but make it through together.  The only drawback to this film is that most of the spotlight is on Loren's character while the rest of the movies actors are in the background.

As other reviewers have said, the character development is extremely well done, and by the time the movie is half over, I felt the drama was realistic, not overly done at all. The bond between mother and daughter is sensitive, caring...all the right stuff.
Loren's acting in this piece was waaaay ahead of it's time, and treats a theme that is now 'chic' in current cinema - the ravages of war.
Where other films might glamorize the topic, this one went all the way in realism. And for that it is an uneasy view.

736964,5,6303934315,"For some reason, the Italian cinema has done a number of excellent movies about civilian life in WWII.  Such movies as ""Open City"", ""Paisan"", etc. have done an impressive job of showing the challenges of life in a world turned upside down by the effects of war.  ""Two Women"" is another excellent example of the genre.

In ""Two Women"", we follow a woman and her daughter in Rome as they attempt to avoid the dangers of the encroaching war front.  The daughter is becoming too nervous from all the bombing and mom (Sophia Loren), is a young widow with a number of concerns herself.  They sell off their assets and head towards the home place out in rural Italy.  In their journey for security, they encounter a variety of individuals from pacifist to fascist.  The bombs still fall and the soldiers still fight.  Each place they go to has it's own liabilities and they continue on until disaster strikes in the form of Allied Moroccan soldiers.  The results of this encounter bring out a clear message that was is Hell for everyone and the presence of good guys and bad guys doesn't change that fact.

""Two Women"" tells a tale of confusion, dispair, and tragedy and it does so in a way that seems so innocent at first.  After all, it is in attemting to escape the dangers of war that leads Loren and her daughter to even greater dangers.  In telling this tale of futility, we are given an impressive view of the terrors and horrors of war.  The title of the movie acquires a true yet ironic meaning as we stumble to the end of this brilliant and dispairing movie.

Sophia Loren deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in ""Two Women"".  It was, I understand, the first such award for a foreign-language movie.  Early in the movie, she is speaking to a male friend of hers who asks her what it was like to have married and loved her late husband who was such an old man.  I chuckled when I realized that the producer of ""Two Women"" was Carlo Ponti, the elder spouse of Loren's.  I have no idea if this movie was made before or during their marriage but it was a funny scene to contemplate.

De Sica held with impressive loyalty and absolute commitment, searching for inspiration those minuscule and abominable and unsaid little disgraces of common people. The WW2 was a powerful compendium of inspiration that eventually would lead him to make this prodigious masterpiece around the penuries of two women crossing over no one' s land where the wasted territory worked out as sublime metaphor of the inner and outer feelings of the distorted and defeated human soul in many people.

Sophia Loren won an Oscar and fame with this portrayal of a young widowed mother who escapes war-torn Rome in 1943 with her 13-year-old daughter (played by Eleanora Brown), only to encounter worse hardships on the road, including rape. Loren is feisty and earthy; when she meets an intellectual and idealist (Jean-Paul Belmondo) who falls madly in love with her, she doesn't understand him and rejects his loftiness. The rape scene, especially of Brown, whom Lauren has protected all her life, is brutal, and it unhinges Brown temporarily: her body and soul just shut down - until they learn of the death of Belmondo, whom Brown had loved more than Loren did. De Sica directs brilliantly: every frame has purpose to it, nothing is wasted.

The acting is absolutely superb, and the young JP Belmondo is a great surprise.  The mother leaves Rome with her daughter for the bomb-free countryside, where she finds family and hides.  Of course, it doesn't work out that well, first for danger and hunger, then their fate at the hands of rogue soldiers.  The end is tragic but hopeful, as a new society is set to arise.

Unfortunately, the quality of this dvd is extremely mediocre - fuzzy images, muffled sound, etc.

Most of the film centers around her interaction with the Italian country people who forge a bond with each other under fascist harassment.

Oh, boy! The movie is of 1961, but I have seen better quality TAPES by early Charlie Chaplin. Not just KOCH spent no time cleaning and re-mastering the original, it also seems that they have used the worst original available. On the top of it, the box says it's black and white - what a lie! It is, actually, green and yellow. What else? I could not move further then the scene 8, then the picture stalls, surrounded by yellow squares.

737025,5,6303934315,"'Two Women' is a stark film from the neo-realism school that still packs a solid punch.  Sophia Loren plays a beautiful widow who seeks to protect her teenage daughter from the ravages of World War II Rome.  She's proud, opinionated, but protective and loving toward her daughter Rosetta.  The two women flee to the widow's village, where they meet an idealistic young man to whom they are both attracted.  The tragic events occur quite late in the film, but by the time they do, we really know who these characters are, making the film extremely powerful.
Loren looks stunning and acts wonderfully, but all the actors in the film are wonderful as well.  But Loren had (and still has) that quality that makes her the center of all attention every time she is on-screen.  A stunning actress in a stunning role.
I cannot finish this review without commenting on the abysmal video transfer to DVD.  This is without a doubt the worst looking and sounding DVD I have ever seen since the medium was invented.  I wish Sophia Loren would sue this video company for the travesty they have done to this fine film.  How in the world with all the technology at our disposal can such a poor product be released on the market?  I only hope a proper version can be released soon.  This is criminal.

This movie is very serious drama with some light moments but you'll see termendious acting by everyone. This is a rare reminder of the terror of World War II, the stuggles, the hardship that people had to endure. My only problem with the DVD is the audio. I don't want to discourage anyone from buying this great motion picture but the sound is TERRIBLE. I don't understand how the studio could let something like this be sold with such a terrible audio track. It's scratchy and tinny in sound. Other than that the picture quality if pretty good but is still worth owning. It's a great Italian movie.",1031702400,45,776,4.630434782608695
737028,5,6303934315,"I saw ""Two Women"" on VHS, an Embassy Entertainment edition whose cover doesn't look like the cover shown here on Amazon.  The film quality wasn't great but it was certainly adequate.  It's worth looking for decent copy of this film for it's one that shouldn't be missed.
This is a film showing the tragedy and pain that befalls ordinary people in the time of war.  It's also a film about the relationship of a mother (Sophia Loren) to her 12 year-old daughter, a relationship that is warm and loving yet one that war tries to tears apart.
Those who are convinced of the ""necessity"" or the ""logic"" of military action should watch ""Two Women"" and see how such action disrupts and tears up individuals, families and communities.  The dislocation, food shortages, rape and death depicted in this film are all vestiges of war that have not changed and still affect war-torn areas today.
The characters in this film are all very real, very believable;  and this gives it greater credibility.  The foremost example is Sophia Loren whose stunning beauty is tempered by her down-to-earth character. It's easy to see why some of the secondary characters fall in love with her. You will too.",1030838400,6,1180,4.788177339901478
737029,4,6303934315,This is one of the best Italian dramas.  Powerful performance.  Strong movie.,1029888000,2,77,5.333333333333333
737087,4,6303934315,"In 1961 TWO WOMEN was considered a shocker; over time, however, we have seen the trauma central to the film depicted on screen so often and so much more graphically that many will feel the film has lost its edge.  Even so, Sophia Loren's justly famous performance is powerful enough to keep one focused on the film, and she is extremely well supported with strong performances by the likes of Eleonora Brown, Jean-Paul Belmondo, and Raf Vallone.  De Sica's very simple, unpretentious presentation also continues to serve the film extremely well.
Loren is a widow who runs a small grocery store in Rome during World War II, and when the war moves in upon the city she decides to take daughter Rosetta (Brown) to the small village where she herself was born, but safety proves elusive.  The trip to the village is frought with danger, and although the villagers have some safety in their isolation even they are subject to peril.  When the Allies begin to close in on Rome, Loren decides to return to the city on foot with her daughter--and unwittingly places both her and her daughter at the mercy of renegade soliders who, in a scene once considered extraordinary violent, rape both mother and daughter in a bombed out church.
Loren's performance here is simply extraordinary, and she gives us a woman of peasant mentality who has acquired a somewhat urban edge through her life as a shopkeeper in Rome, totally believable in her tunnel-visioned toughness; if any one ever had doubts that Hollywood essentially wasted her talents, they need look no further than this film for proof.  Unfortunately, however, one need only look at the reviews here to realize how incredibly bad the prints of this film are.  And not to put too fine a point on it, the Madacy release (which shows Loren and Brown in black and white on the cover) is easily one of the most incredibly shoddy videotapes it has ever been my misfortune to encounter: the picture slips in and out of focus, is consistently grainy, and the sound quality is atrocious.  This is a film in desperate need of restoration--but until that happens, fans of world cinema will have to put up with it, for this is an important film that should be seen.  Four stars for the film, zero for video quality.",1020384000,13,2250,4.707379134860051
737088,5,6303934315,"Sophia Loren was apparently well acquainted with war and hunger. When TWO WOMEN was released, the film magazines depicted her as having experienced the horrors of war first hand as a young Italian girl during WWII. Like Audrey Hepburn, she was purported to have been saved from starvation by the advancing Allies.
TWO WOMEN was released about 15 years after WWII. The film storyline follows the day-to-day struggles of a young mother and her teenage daughter who are refugees fleeing the violence of the war brought to their Italian village during WWII. Fleeing to a place of safety, the two endure many hardships.
The film does not include gratuitous violence, but it does not pull any punches either. Many of the scenes are horrifying, or at least they were to me in the 1960s. In one scene women are raped by a gang of deserters from the Italian army. I was very young when I saw this film, but I cannot recall a more horrific scene even though the actual act of rape is not shown. In another scene, women who have betrayed their fellow villagers are punished in a way that I still find shocking--although very Italian (the Nazis would have shot them!!).
Unfortunatley, the horrors shown in this film have always been and apparently always will be commonplace wherever men are fighting. The title of the film TWO WOMEN comes from the ""coming of age"" of the young girl who must deal with the rough existence of her world gone mad.
This film is about the moral courage of women and as it was released at the beginning of the resurgence of the women's movment it was incredibly salient.",1010793600,4,1586,4.647686832740214

737091,5,6303934315,"All of the truly great movies deal with people we care about. They're about people we want to spend 90 mins or two hours with. We feel as if we know these people by the time the film ends. Think of ""The Godfather"", ""Wild Strawberries"", ""A Street Car Named Desire"", or ""A Rebel Without A Cause"". We feel these characters struggles, and go along with them. Vittorio De Sica's ""Two Women"" follows in this tradition. Like De Sica's other film ""The Bicycle Thief"", the characters in this movie seem real. There's a deep understanding between the viewer and the characters. The characters in this movie have simplistic needs that we all can understand. I'm kinda shocked to actually come across all these 1 and 2 star reviews. When I first saw this film, I was really taken with it. The movie which is based on a novel by Alberto Moravia and was written by De Sica and Cesare Zavattini is as I put in my title, simply a masterpiece. Sophia Loren stars as Cesira, a lonely mother of a teenage daughter,Rosetta (Eloenora). With a war going on, Cesira (Loren) decides that her daughter and herself should leave Rome, and head to a place they feel they will be more safe. After their store gets bombed. Now, for those who don't know what the movie is about I'll tell you. It's about the brutal rape of a mother and daughter. Now, if you've seen this movie, you see how De Sica is almost teasing us. He sets up so many situations where we feel, oh! OK, now this is where it's going to happen. We see men stare at Loren. They're never seen anything so beautiful before. You could see the pure lust in their eyes. De Sica is trying to ""trick"" us. He's keeping up our suspense. So that when it finally does happen, we've been watching the characters so long, and have come to care about them, that we find the event to be truly tragic. Before I saw this film, I thought the rape would happen early on in the movie, and the rest of the film is about them dealing with it. As you can tell, De Sica is a heck of a lot smarter than me. He makes us develop a relationship with the characters first. Because think about it. If it happened in the beginning of the movie, would you really care? I mean, yes, probably you would, but it wouldn't be so much because of the characters. It's because your seeing a terrible act being committed. Besides the heartfelt ating by Loren and Brown (Rosetta) there's wonderful music by Armando Trovajoli. And very good cinematography by Gabor Pogany. From what I've seen by De Sica, this is probably his second best film (Behind ""The Bicycle Thief, which is my favorite movie of all time). This is a truly outstanding piece of work. And, as many know this is the first movie where a Foreign actor(male or female) won an Oscar for acting. A must for all film lovers!
 p.s.- As mentioned by other reviewers this movie really needs to be restored. The movie is in terrible condition. I think even worst than ""famous"" awful dubbing job on Truffaut's ""Day For Night"".",994377600,9,2977,4.442413162705667
