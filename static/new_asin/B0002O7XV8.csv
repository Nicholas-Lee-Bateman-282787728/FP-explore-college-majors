8029853,5,B0002O7XV8,"As far as I'm concerned, this is one of the best worst films of all time.

Here's the synopsis from IMDB:
Billy, 10, a dreamer, wants to be taken seriously so he can live with his toy-designer father on Catalina Island. Billy's plans get seriously spoilt when Sherlock, a talking police dog, demands his help to rescue his police detective handler kidnaped by smugglers. But Sherlock likes to keep his talking a closely-guarded secret. So now no one will take Billy seriously until he rescues the kidnaped detective and catches the smugglers...
- Written by Richard Harding Gardner <rhgca@aol.co>

What Richard doesn't mention is that Sherlock is a very grumpy, inexplicably Scottish talking dog detective. Even stranger is the fact that Sherlock gets kidnapped fairly early in the film, and is out of action for a great deal of the movie (!) It's a weird little kids B-Movie that had my friends and I in hysterics - the kind of movie you'd love to see on MST3K.",1450742400,,962,4.754491017964072
8029854,3,B0002O7XV8,My daughter really liked this movie.  She is eight.  It is an older movie and is definitely for kids. It is probably not something that you'd want to sit down and watch over and over with your child though.,1275696000,,206,4.256410256410256
8029855,1,B0002O7XV8,"I think Sherlock is a horrible movie for kids. Why would I want my kids to learn how to smoke? My daughter now thinks our dog talks, which is annoying.  ""Dad why isn't Muffin talking to me?"". This movie is also a 99 cent stores, so save your money if you really must buy this movie. Also the little kid in the movie doesnt seem like he takes many showers. Very dirty child.",1227916800,2,373,4.109589041095891
