5188696,5,B008XAT0Z0,"We had visited Alcatraz in October, and once you go, you just want to learn more! This DVD was very interesting, and told us things we didn't know when we visited........I especially enjoyed listening to the criminals, guards and wardens and family members who lived on the island......(which I never realized!)
If you have ever visited Alcatraz, you will love this DVD!!",1357257600,5,371,5.0
5188697,3,B008XAT0Z0,"The history of Alcatraz prison is varied, fascinating, and at times tragic. The federal prison on Alcatraz Island in the chilly waters of California's San Francisco Bay housed some of America's most difficult and dangerous felons during its years of operation from 1934 to 1963. Among those who served time at the maximum-security facility were the notorious gangster Al ""Scarface"" Capone (1899-1947) and murderer Robert ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" Stroud (1890-1963). Allegedly no inmate ever successfully escaped ""The Rock"", although more than a dozen known attempts were made over the years. After the prison was shut down due to high operating costs, the island was occupied for almost two years, starting in 1969, by a group of Native-American activists. Today, historic Alcatraz Island, which was also the site of a U.S. military prison from the late 1850s to 1933, is a popular tourist destination. This Documentary tells the story of Alcatraz and the people who lived there.

I think this is an interesting release by Mill Creek Entertainment, and people who have an interest in the history of Alcatraz and the history of American law enforcement will enjoy this DVD Set. The main documentary is very interesting and very informative. In this documentary you'll find interviews with former Alcatraz inmates and interviews with people who worked there ( Captains, Guards, etc. ). These people all have very interesting stories to share, and these interviews really gives you an inside look at how life was inside the prison. It was great to hear from Clarence Carnes, the man who was allegedly the ""Godfather"" of Alcatraz, very interesting interview. The narration is great, the footages are very good, overall this is a very solid documentary and a great watch.

Now the bad: If you are looking for a documentary about the legendary 1962 escape by Frank Morris and the Anglin Brothers then don't buy this DVD, very little amount of time is spent talking about the escape. The main documentary is very good, but the extras are very disappointing. What you'll find on Disc 2 is nothing more than 5 old black and white film clips, including one from 1935, and to me it just wasn't a good watch. Also included on disc 2 is a 1938 movie called ""Prison Train"", and I seriously don't know why Mill Creek decided to include this movie on this set, this is simply not a good idea and the movie itself is not really good.

So overall I still recommend this DVD to anybody who have an interest in Alcatraz and to anybody who enjoy watching historical documentaries. Remember that very little amount of time is dedicated to the 1962 escape by Morris and the Anglins, and that the extras are disappointing. But I'm sure you won't be disappointed by the main documentary, it's a good watch. Enjoy ! :)

5188706,3,B008XAT0Z0,"The video is very, very old. Certainly most of this history hasn't changed, but an update is desperately needed. Some of the episodes are long and drawn out, not keeping the attention of a 21st century audience. With as many people visiting Alcatraz today, I would think there could be a fresher version.",1423440000,,304,4.754716981132075

There are a few photos included that I have not seen before, but not worth the tedious hours it takes to make it through this documentary.  It would have been much better with a scripted narration rather than the personal accounts that tend to ramble on and on.",1406419200,,321,4.333333333333333

5188718,4,B008XAT0Z0,"The movie is a good ""addition"" for anyone interested in some history of Alcatraz, but like everything in life it is something you need to truly see for it yourself and of course we can never truly know without personal experience in prison or from working there.

The video is presented in it's original footage unremastered so, it is historical low vhs-like quality. Although I was disappointed in the video quality, I enjoyed it and realize we are fortunate to have anything at all. As usual, the historical value was not realized until it was too late. There are a lot of historical 'bits and pieces' of footage pieced together from news media and interviews, not just a story.

The guards, wardens and even the overall video itself, all explain that the media exaggerated the stories and that life there was much more subtle and uneventful. There was a lot of denial from prison authority (unfortunately to be expected) about the escapes and the true nature there which reminded me a lot of the movie ""Murder in the First"".

There were only two prisoners interviewed, which was only a small sample of the overall number of prisoners held there. I would have liked to hear more perspectives on life there, especially as the interviewed prisoners themselves stated, that they were so secluded from overall daily contact inside and especially outside that they were mostly limited to there own perspectives.

I grew up in the San Francisco, Bay Area and remember passing by Alcatraz often, viewing it from the Oakland Bay bridge, and my father telling the family about it. The stories, the look of the structures built there, and the fact it was on that little island secluded all by itself, only accessible by boat, made it more intriguing to me.

My elementary school went to Alcatraz on a field trip when I was about 10 yrs old, so about 1984, and I loved it.  I have not been back since and often wonder what I have forgotten and have heard they don't do as thorough of tour anymore.

I remember the ferry, seeing the cells, the cell door mechanism, the cafeteria, the showers, the yard, and solitary confinement which you get to experience. The tour talked about daily life, murders and Alcatraz's history. They showed the original cells from the most famous true escape depicted in the movie ""Escape From Alcatraz"" and the wanted posters for the escapees.

Modern Prisons
I have friends who have worked in modern prisons and jails who have told me about life in them and the good and bad treatment and murders which took place in them from both sides, worker/inmates while they were employed. Sometimes the news mentions it but not often. It's one of those things that most of us could never fathom and that everyone just forgets about. I believe the maximum security prisons of today are more uneventful by means of seclusion, but medium security prisons and jails are more eventful because of more freedom of inmate, guard and outside interaction.

Some stories of modern incidents include sex, fights, murders with blunt objects, suicides, etc regarding inmates and guards. So, I can't believe Alcatraz was so uneventful so many years ago.",1360454400,4,3149,4.805914972273568
5188719,5,B008XAT0Z0,"Best part of this collection is all of the interviews, both guards & Cons, who talked about what their time was like on island.  Added a lot to the normal historical information I expected to find.  Very interesting set of DVD's to watch and gain a new perspective on Alcatraz.",1360454400,,277,4.52

8531849,3,B008XAT0Z0,"I'd like to give this 2 dvd set a rating of 2 1/2 stars to split it right down the middle. Like most of the other reviewers who are Alcatraz enthusiasts, I found some of this documentary entertaining and somewhat informative and some of it not. Disc One contains 2 chapters : the first containing no narration, just interviews, photos, etc. The second chapter, which was recorded in the 1960's, is very interesting and even presented some new information on the history of this prison. However, as stated in a few previous reviews, there is not much information on the infamous 1962 escape by Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers. A few inmate's opinions do shed a different perspective on the escape, but not much else.
Disc Two should never have been included here as it's nothing more than clips from a tv show in the 1960's. The quality of the picture and sound is awful. It offers no new material and only serves as a rehash of information already known. My overall opinion: If you can locate a copy of this documentary at a budget or reasonable price, it's worth it for Disc One alone.  But for full price, not recommended.",1522713600,,1129,4.589108910891089
