8132391,5,B000GI3KWG,"Something unusual in contemporary cinema; a measured, satisfying, yet exquisitely restrained meditation on womanhood and personal responsibility, as seen through the closely followed lives of two adults (both well acted, though Sarah Grappin is mesmerizing) and the friends and lovers they interact with. Mailott (who co-wrote and directed the film) even manages a late, convincing miracle, and more than a touch of evil. Though it was originally made for French television  which explains the exceptionally low price  it blows most other feature dramas out of the water.",1419897600,,571,5.551724137931035
8132392,3,B000GI3KWG,"Mostly, this movie was rather fragmented.  Maybe that reflects the state of mind of the main character, Sara, and that story was good, but the quality of the film was very marginal. This theme was really well done, the tragic consequence of Sara's disconnection from her rut-like life as a mother of a young toddler, was riviting. What makes it lesbian is her encounter with a random stranger, a women, and they hook up for a couple of days while she stays disconnected from her life. BUT, it just wasn't developed enough. The idle moments with no substance were a waste of time that could have been spent on building the scenario toward the tragic ending. Worth a watch though.",1182038400,12,678,4.65
