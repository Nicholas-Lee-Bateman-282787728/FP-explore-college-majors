2417268,5,B000BHJCE2,"Yes, Seinfeld is always funny.  Here's what he said about his comedic inspiration:  ""[Lois Nettleton] was married to Jean Shepherd.  He's the guy who invented talk radio and really formed my entire comedic sensibility.  Yes.  I learned how to do comedy from Jean Shepherd."" He said this in his commentary for ""The Gymnast"" episode on the sitcom's DVD set, sixth season.  Who is Jean Shepherd?  See the book EXCELSIOR, YOU FATHEAD! THE ART AND ENIGMA OF JEAN SHEPHERD.",1138060800,,467,4.910256410256411
2417269,5,B000BHJCE2,"This is great for any Seinfeld fan. The writing and character development of the show makes it one of tv's all time greats. I'm not going to plug the show anymore, because it's common knowledge of how good it is. The package itself is a great deal (You'd pay a lot more at any store).",1136332800,3,284,4.181818181818182
2417270,5,B000BHJCE2,"First of all I love Seinfeld.  So I will not even attempt to say anything about the show itself.  I am way too biased.  I will however comment on the DVDs.  I received this 6 season set for Christmas and I was very surprised at how well put together they are.  The menus, the graphics and the flow are almost perfect.  If you are looking for a TV show to buy, all of these DVDs are worth the money.",1135728000,5,398,3.9746835443037973
2417271,5,B000BHJCE2,"I held out for a long time to purchase seinfeld on DVD, finally purchasing this box set featuring the first 6 seasons. Being a huge fan of the show it didn't take me long to watch every single episode from the seasons and slowly getting through the special features which make these series even more endearing to the Seinfeld fan, as they are highly entertaining and very informative. I found this to be a very economical way to buy the series as it works out cheaper than buying each set as it is released individually, if you can wait that long... Now I can't wait for the last 3 seasons to be released.",1166745600,,605,4.3628318584070795
2417272,5,B000BHJCE2,My husband is a huge fan and cannot get enough of reruns! I bought the set for his birthday and he just loves it. Great price for the set!,1163116800,2,138,3.793103448275862
2417273,5,B000BHJCE2,"I was never a huge fan of Seinfeld - I watched it if I remembered it was on, and always enjoyed it, but thought it was over-hyped. A friend bought me the six season box set as a gift, and I'm glad he did! The episodes get better with repeated viewings, and the fantastic extras (deleted scenes, insightful commentary, etc) should be a guide for all these inferior, sloppy TV DVDs currently being released.",1159660800,3,405,4.486486486486487
2417274,5,B000BHJCE2,"The Seinfeld DVD collection is the bomb! I love Seinfeld, and to have a collection of Seasons 1 - 6 has kept me laughing! I only wish the collection contained all 9 seasons. Will look forward to having a complete set.",1156982400,2,217,4.317073170731708
2417275,4,B000BHJCE2,"i bought all the 6 seasons and started watching episode after another and i must say from what i saw yet that this episodes stuffed with jokes but i don't find all of them funny-some ideas jery seinfeld make in his stand-up are interesting but i find not alot of them actually funny-the story lines in the episodes are good but lets say that in every season i watch like 3 or 4 episodes and then comes one GOOD EPISODE that after watching it i go 'BOY THIS PEOPLE ARE CRAZY AND THIS SHOW CRAZY' and i laugh and appreciate i watch this show cause this episodes cought me. like in every sitcom, in seinfeld there is also one charecter that STEALS THE SHOW FROM OTHER CHARACTERS AND FROM SEINFELD WHO IS THE BIG STAR and its no one else but KRAMER who sometimes more funny then the other characters-in first episodes in season 1 they don't use that charecter alot but in next seasons this KRAMER just so crazy and funny and he responsible for me to go 'BOY,THIS SHOW CRAZY-LOL'.in sex and the city it was SAMANTHA who stole the show with her crazyness(i have that series too).the first 3 seasons in seinfeld are random stock of episodes that have no connection to one another but only in season 4 the episodes story lines become connected to one another(u cant understand one episodes without seeing the previous one).comparing to sex and the city-seinfeld has more content in its story line but the bottom line is that the show is good but im not crazy about this show cause the stuffed jokes in it don't always make me laugh.the cd quality is AWSOME-too good considering the fact that this show is about NOTHING,i wish that the cd quality and many preferences that the dvd offers would be in all dvds of all shows not only in seinfeld.",1156723200,,1734,4.455974842767295

2417278,5,B000BHJCE2,"Ser breve:

1. El pack es 100% recomendado. De lejos la mejor coleccin de DVD's que jams he comprado. Imprescindible para cualquier fan de Seinfeld que se respete. 2. Los detalles ofrecidos por Amazon son bastante ambiguos respecto a las caractersticas multilenguajes del pack, pero me arriesgu y la sorpresa fue total al encontrarme con que cada DVD contiene hasta los menores detalles en Espaol, Francs y Portugus, incluyendo mens, subttulos y la opcin de dilogos traducidos que la verdad no recomiendo. Prefiero disfrutar las bromas en su idioma original pero ayudndome de cuando en cuando con los subttulos. 3. Por cierto, no s si recuerdan que en los captulos de Sony siempre haba una pequea parte sin subttulos al inicio de cada captulo. Pues les cuento que en este pack estos puntos ciegos no existen. 4. Los extras? espectaculares!!! Es una verdadera fantasa terminar cada captulo y rememorar junto a los protagonistas las ya aejas ancdotas que acompaaron la realizacin de cada episodio. 5. Qu esperas para comprarlo? Tengo la sensacin de que esta es una edicin muy limitada ya que lo despachan desde Alemania. S, desde Alemania! Al parecer, Amazon Germany encarg unas cuantas decenas de estos DVD's y solo cuando los recibieron se dieron cuenta que no eran leidos por los reproductores europeos. Bueno, pero esta es solo una suposicin. Qu ms podra explicar el hecho de embarcar el pack desde Europa y no desde USA?",1153699200,5,1423,4.953974895397489
2417279,5,B000BHJCE2,Was surprised to be able to fine complete set of Seinfeld series. Made my husband very happy for fathers day. Thank you Amazon!,1152921600,,127,4.565217391304348
2417280,5,B000BHJCE2,"If you're a T.V. Seinfeld fan you will absolutely love the DVD's.  The scenes that are cut to insert commercials by syndicators are restored on the high quality, uniterupted DVD versions.  I grew up in the United States and had always liked the series from television.  I was married while living/working/studying in China in 2002 and bought the DVD's for my wife on our coming to the United States in 2005.  She had never seen Seinfeld before and had never been exposed to this style of humor or the slice of American life that the series presents.  We have watched the DVD's over and over again and they never fail to make us laugh and lift our spirits when we've had a bad day.  We utilize the closed captioning option and it has been a great help for my wife in acquiring an understanding of casual English usage including slang, and idiom.  On a more serious note, owning so many seasons and watching the episodes regularly makes you realize the sad truth that much of American life really is focused on the themes of myopic self-interest presented and ridiculed in this series. I sometimes worry that individuals may actually see the series as a validation of their lack of ethics, morals, and connection with the Creator instead of as a revelation and jabbing at today's inappropriate social dynamics; just as the Archie Bunker/All In the Family series did in the 1970's.
The DVD sets include great special features from ""How It Began"" to ""Making a Seinfeld Episode"", deleted scenes, behind the scenes commentary from cast and creators, never-before-seen standup footage of Jerry, original NBC promotional ads and trailers, outtakes and bloopers, and much, much more.  It's obvious that a lot of thought and work went into producing the DVD sets and I can't wait until the remaining seasons come out for sale at Amazon.  After all; ""Who wouldn't love Jerry?""
Episodes included in this set are:
Season 1- The Seinfeld Chronicles, Male Un-bonding, The Stake Out, The Robbery, The Stock Tip.

Season 4- The Trip (Parts 1&2), The Pitch/The Ticket (1hour), The Wallet, The Bubble Boy, The Cheever Letters, The Opera, The Virgin, The Contest, The Airport, The Pick, The Visa, The Movie, The Outing, The Shoes, The Old Man, The Implant, The Handicap Spot, The Junior Mint, The Smelly Car, The Pilot (Parts 1&2).

2417281,5,B000BHJCE2,"Seinfield is the rare bird that appeals to both sexes and has characters who are morally reprehensible in many ways.  The 1st and 6th seasons are inconsistent.  In the beginning the show was still finding its way and the actors were still trying to define their characters.  By the last season the writers seemed to be trying too hard and the humor was over the top.  Still every episode has several storylines so some of them are great while others may falter.  Kramer sliding and falling is not my favorite part, but that doesn't waste too much time in each episode.  The outrageous situations such as the Whale & the golf ball, the fire at the ATM, the Soup Nazi who turns down business showcase what is right about the series.  Repeat viewings are still funny and since syndication cuts out parts the dvds are welcome relief.",1146009600,4,829,4.598639455782313
2417282,5,B000BHJCE2,"This box set is one of the funniest collections that you'll find anywhere. I would recommend for anyone who liked it Milt Pupique's ""Revelations"". It is one of the strangest and best books that I've chanced upon on Amazon.",1144195200,2,222,4.717948717948718
2417283,5,B000BHJCE2,"This was a great purchase and a must have for any fan of the series.  Other than just reliving the hilarious moments,the extras that come with the DVD (outtakes, bloopers, interviews, deleted scenes, commentary) makes this a complete Seinfeld experience that all will enjoy. Again, a must have for fans and a more than better introduction to the new or casual fan!",1142726400,6,364,4.870967741935484
2417284,5,B000BHJCE2,"I bought this as a gift to my girlfriend and we have both watch the first 4 seasons in sequence (not all at once).  The product is of great quality and you can see people put alot of work into it.  Not a hasty production.  It is full of extra material and interviews and making of and deleted scenes.  The pictures in the cases are all different and it is all done very well.

I strongly recomended if interested.",1142553600,7,413,4.177215189873418
2417285,5,B000BHJCE2,"A must have for any sienfeld fan,

The dvd's are very informative about how the show got started and how each episode was developed. There are lots of out takes which are hilarious,I wish there were more of them. The dvd's are packaged beautifully and play beautifully in my player,it is easy to shuffle through and see what you want.

8086774,5,B000BHJCE2,"Seinfeld embodies what all TV programs should be. Quality  programming. Funny, lovable, top-notch writing brought to life by top-notch actors. Episodes you can watch more than once that don't lose their luster with each viewing.

I was just a young boy when this show was on the air only to discover it in syndication during my late-teenage years. Now I own every season available thus far. My grandfather liked it too.",1181692800,,419,4.887323943661972

8086780,5,B000BHJCE2,It's the only series based on nothing that can make you laugh like anything else...,1168300800,,83,4.6
8086781,5,B000BHJCE2,"I actually went ahead and purchased this set, since it turned out to be a cost effective way of purchasing the first six seasons. However, I have to wonder about my purchase since I imagine there will be a ""Special Collector's Edition"" of all of Seinfeld's seasons after the ninth and final season is released individually on DVD, but it is only a guess. That is, I expect this to happen if Seinfeld is like all other long running TV shows recently released on DVD. Unlike a simple bundling of individual season DVDs such as this, a collector's edition is bound to have lots of extras and all nine seasons at an even steeper discount than this bundle.

At any rate, this contains the first six seasons of Seinfeld which can basically be broken into two parts. The first part consists of the abbreviated seasons one and two, and is good comedy, but you can tell the cast and writers are trying to figure out what exactly this show is supposed to be. The second part is seasons 3-6, and consists of the first four of Seinfeld's five ""golden years"". Starting in season three the show really hits its stride, and continues to do so through season seven. At the conclusion of season seven Larry David left the show's executive producer slot, and although Seinfeld was still great and innovative in it last two seasons, to me it just never quite reached the peaks of seasons 3-7.

Now, though, seasons 1-7 are being sold as a pack, and season eight is on the way, so I would no longer advise this bundle as a good value.",1167523200,,1514,4.481884057971015
