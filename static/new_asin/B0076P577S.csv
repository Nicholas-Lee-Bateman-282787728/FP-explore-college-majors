Its bright, colorful, happy, positive, musical. They love it and get so excited whenever I put it on unlike with any other show. We pre ordered Season 2 and cant wait for season 3.

The Fresh Beat Band being one of many. Having cut that cable cord over a year ago and discovering ""Prime"" by accident from enrolling in Amazon Mom, and any one of the ""Prime"" services easily justifies the hundred dollar annual premium, ten fold. Music. Books. TV shows and movies. Free shipping.!!!!! Fresh beat rocks. Amazon rocks.

5058268,5,B0076P577S,"If your children are fans of this show, buy the DVD sets!  When I was researching the sets before I bought the first one, I was a little concerned after reading the one-star reviews for both this and the first season.  My wife and I decided to risk it and buy season one, and we haven't regretted it yet.  Both seasons one and two work perfectly on our DVD/VHS combo, both portable DVD players we have, and our Blu Ray player.  With copyright laws being the way they are right now, you are going to run across a lot more DVD sets that are created with the express condition that they do not play in any system capable of copying the info on the disc.  If that is all you have to play your DVDs on, sorry, but you're out of luck, and maybe someone who thinks its perfectly legal to make a copy of any DVD your rent as long as you don't sell the copy (FYI, its not legal).  If you have a standard DVD player, this set should work with no problems at all, and your children will be entertained and educated for hours.",1341446400,,1014,4.121827411167513

8511101,5,B0076P577S,"My 8 year old was obsessed with Fresh Beat Band when she was 2-4 years old. Now our 2-year old had followed suit. And to be honest ,  the well-written songs and good choreography appeal to me , also. It's a show that moves at a good pace ,  is stimulating,  but not over-stimulating. The educational content focuses on music concepts and vocabulary,  as well as friendship, teamwork, patience, and stick-to-it-iveness.  The characters are likable but not annoying , and the discourse is always appropriate. The show producers managed to make a high-quality show that is entertaining, as well as hip and relevant and completely appropriate for 1-6 year olds. And even though she won't admit it, my 8 year old still kind of digs this show. Out of all of them, Season 2 might be my favorite . ",1482624000,,790,4.64748201438849

We love the first Marina and adore the lighthearted message of ""keep on trying"" of almost every episode. We also enjoy the fact that nothing political or philosophical creeps in. We are a very conservative family and are appreciative of the appropriate dress of the characters!! ;)",1465430400,,425,4.532467532467533
