8558445,4,B00AWJSMSG,"This is the second version of this take on A Christmas Carol I've seen. I also have the version starring Jeffery West. I'm docking this version One Star because David zum Brunnen, who plays the role of Ebenezer Scrooge, seems more like a mad scientist than a world renowned author of classic novels.

This DVD has a blooper/out-take ""reel"" for its Extras. No subtitles...",1480809600,,371,4.796875
8558446,5,B00AWJSMSG,"This was very interesting and well acted out as Charles Dickens writing ""A Christmas Carol"".  Definitely worth adding to my collection, 51 at present time.",1452729600,,155,5.2
8558447,5,B00AWJSMSG,"David zum Brunnen's delightfully enchanting and mesmerizing depiction of Charles Dickens working out the plot and characters for ""A Christmas Carol"" in the wee hours of Friday the 13th of October, 1843, can be enjoyed ANY time of the year!  In fact, it's my new fave ""make the world bright again"" DVD whenever I need a lift!

If Simon Cowell's dark portrayal of Dickens in his one-man show left a sour taste in your mouth (it did mine and I normally like anything S.C. does), zum Brunnen's definitely will not.  First, it's filmed in a room that has all the trappings of a successful author's study in 19th-century London, not on a drab, nearly-bare stage with only part of a gigantic picture frame as a backdrop.  Second, zum Brunnen is wearing exactly the clothes one would expect of an English gentleman in the early 1840s, not in a circa-1990s, plainly cut, blue velvet suit which Cowell apparently thought was ""close enough"".  It was not.

On to the story itself, which begins at 1 a.m. as Dickens returns from one of his regular late night walks around the city.  He has to come up with his next Christmas story, and over the next hour or so, we are right there with him as he tries out different names for the characters.  Once he settles on a name, he bounces around the room grabbing whatever items are handy to become that character while saying his or her lines out loud - a method Dickens was famous for employing.  At one point, thanks to outstanding camera work and DvB's ability to switch voices and expressions in the blink of an eye, we totally believe he's each person in a conversation between two characters.

His child-like enthusiasm is infectious, to the point that I found myself mimicking his expressions same as if I were I a child watching only a few feet away from the front row of a theatre.  And exactly as a child would, toward the end when he asks ""But what shall I call this story?"", I couldn't help but yell out loud ""A Christmas Carol!"".

There's only one glitch I didn't even notice until the second or third time through.  Because it's not filmed on a set in a studio, but in a paneled, book-lined room with period furnishings on the third floor of the North Carolina capitol building, when we're told it's one o'clock in the morning at the beginning, daylight is clearly visible through the window on the far side of the room.  Other than that, the attention to detail in this production is spot-on perfect, making it a joy to watch over and over, any time of the year!",1422230400,2,2507,4.517699115044247
