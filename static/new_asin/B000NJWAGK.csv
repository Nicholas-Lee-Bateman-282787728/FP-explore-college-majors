8178804,5,B000NJWAGK,"this is a very sad movie,  I would recommend this this to any agency working with children who might be dealing with something like this. I was a foster parent when i bought it and was hoping to prove a point This is very true with some kids who have RAD",1375660800,,254,3.980392156862745
8178805,4,B000NJWAGK,"What director Brandon did with this documentary was to present a slice-of-life moment in a child's life, nothing more.  Yes he is a child with many psychiatric problems, but the film maker wasn't trying to present a hard-hitting social statement, nor is it a tell-all documentary that those working with kids want it to be. It's a fascinating and insightful look at the plight parents with children like Jon-Michael must face daily.",1297814400,,432,5.0
8178806,3,B000NJWAGK,"I have a masters in child counseling and spent 7 years working at a residential treatment facility taking care of kids exactly like Jon-Michael. The kids I took care of stayed at the group home/institution that I worked at for a year in order to learn behavioral and coping skills. Jon-Michael and the environment he lived in, that is displayed in this video, reminds me a lot of the kids I worked with. He has many of the same issues: drug abusive pregnancy, lack of a positive, dominate father in the home, unstable/uneducated primary caregiver, and a poverty stricken environment. Also, on top of all of this, the mental health industry is extremely underfunded compared to other medical related fields. The only part of the mental health industry that is funded properly is medication and that's why most kids like Jon-Michael is just put on pills and gets little help elsewhere. For example, Jon-Michael had to wait many months for a therapist and due to funding problems and burn out rates of therapists (burnout is another topic. It relates to funding issues also.)... counseling is usually short term. Therapists change or funding dries up. Kids such as Jon-Michael need a consistent therapist that helps both the parent and child cope over an extended period of time. This documentary shows that problem and many others. Basically... the topic of this documentary is a good one and seeing a child like Jon-Michael and his family in real life puts a face on the issue. With that said, the documentary was poorly and inappropriately done.
First of all, the main individual who led the documentary, who asked the questions, seemed very uneducated himself. He asked some very stupid questions especially when he filmed Jon-Michael. Most of the time, their interactions made no sense and had no purpose. There was no structure to his interaction with the child. Another thing I didn't like is how the questioner filmed Jon-Michael. Half of the time, Jon Michael wore very little clothing. Most of the time very short shorts. It was borderline inappropriate. Also he would film him on a bed or couch laying in awkward positions. There were moments in the documentary I asked myself what was the point of filming this kid half nude rambling about nothing. Don't get me wrong... I think it is important to show real life moments in a documentary when it comes to behavior, however, I feel this documentary took it too far. For example, there's a moment in the movie in which Jon-Michael is laying awkwardly on his bed with just short shorts on and while he rambles about nothing, he starts fondling himself. This rambling and fondling lasted for literally 30 seconds. I said to myself while watching, ""ARE YOU SERIOUS? This guy is filming this? You've got to be kidding me."" What's really strange is that the questioner continues to ask stupid questions and ignored the behavior... like it wasn't happening right in front of his eyes. What was the purpose of showing that? The presentation of this documentary was very awkward and felt inappropriately done at times.  I gave the documentary 3 stars based on the topic and the importance of it, however, the documentary it self wasn't very good.",1247011200,,3195,4.873161764705882
