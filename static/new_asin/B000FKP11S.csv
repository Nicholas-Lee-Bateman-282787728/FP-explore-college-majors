8160408,4,B000FKP11S,"I gave this program 4.5 stars because I thought it could have had a little more content on some of the battleships covered but otherwise this is a great program! It begins with coverage of ships from before the time of HMS Dreadnought (like the Monitor, the Great White Fleet) and covers the HMS Dreadnought and the ships immediately following it. Then it covers the battle of Jutland pretty well and the effect of the Washington Naval Treaty had on the number and size of the battleships. The period of World War 2 was well covered with the development of the American, British, German and Japanese (Yamato especially) battleships. The rise of the airplane is covered with the chase of the Bismarck and of the attack on Pearl Harbor but the program keeps its focus on the battleships pretty well. It then goes into the Cold War history of the Iowa class battleships during the Korean and Vietnam Wars, the reintroduction of the Iowa class during the Reagan Administration's defense buildup of the 1980's. The explosion aboard the Iowa battleship could have had more coverage but was well handled. Finally, it ends with the combat history of the battleship during the Gulf War and of the dedication of the USS Missouri in Pearl Harbor. Great program! The naval enthusiast and historian will love this show and anyone who wants to know more about battleships would enjoy this program!",1390953600,2,1383,4.815126050420168
8160409,4,B000FKP11S,"This History Channel disc makes me a little leery to buy more from them, strictly due to production quality. It's a bare bones disc, with no extras, a minimal menu, and nondescript packaging. All this at a price higher than I usually pay for recent theatrical films? That's steep.

And yet if they were to rerelease more in this series, I would absolutely buy them. The production of the disc is minimal, but the actual show is fantastic! I love sailing ships, but I don't know a lot about them. And I knew almost nothing about the Windjammers before this show, so I learned a lot. (Coincidentally, though, I have toured the Star of India, one of the ships profiled herein.) These are the last giants of the Age of Sail, amazing metal hulled ships.

I watched this show twice in a row, once for the experience of the ships at sea and once for all the facts and details. When I bought this, I was actually looking for their episode on the Clipper ships, which isn't currently available. Cheap packaging or no, I'll definitely buy that one when I can!

Rating: 5 stars, but knock one off for the production quality.",1314662400,,1113,4.5
8160410,5,B000FKP11S,This historical documentary made by master director Monte Markum is without a doubt the best on the subject ever made for television. Included is a supurbly researched segment on the wreck of the EDMOND FITZGERALD.  I first saw this film on German Television and have watched it over and over again on U.S. TV.,1234915200,2,310,4.7407407407407405
