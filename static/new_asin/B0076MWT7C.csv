5057564,5,B0076MWT7C,Still enjoyed the adventure of these two movies. National Treasure 1 has a really nice interactive Declaration of Independence  bonus feature.

5057568,1,B0076MWT7C,Received as described but didn't realize there was a difference between regional code (1 and 2). Now stuck with a DVD I can't even watch. Asked for money back and was denied because I open the case so I could watch the movie.,1516924800,,225,4.255813953488372
5057569,5,B0076MWT7C,"I agree with others there appears to be a mis-label on the bluray pack. Disc 2 although labeled Region B does play perfectly on my U.S. player. I had no issues with either discs and both were great quality and color. For those saying these are bootlegs just because of play issues, these are not, you just have to make sure you buy the correct region. They look just like my other bluray Disney discs but you are buying an import box set. For those with DVD region issues Amazon labels them as Non U.S. region 2 with a warning symbol when you choose the option of DVD or bluray.",1516665600,,578,4.263636363636364

5057599,5,B0076MWT7C,"First off these movies are great.  If you haven't seen them you're in for a treat.  Secondly the 2nd movie, Book of Secrets is a Region B Bluray.  I watch all of my movies on a Kodi media center so I used Makemkv to rip the movies into a digital copy.  Both movies worked just fine and even the 2nd movie which is Region B is 24 frames per second.  Both movies also have a Dolby TrueHD audio track, (I couldn't find info on this anywhere).  As long as you know the second movie is Region B and have a region free Bluray player or can rip the disc to watch back you're golden.",1497312000,,575,4.0

5057607,5,B0076MWT7C,These two films are amongst my all-time favorites.  Who can resist story lines that involve finding treasures worth many millions of dollars?

5057639,1,B0076MWT7C,"This review if for the Double Pack containing two movies on blu-ray: (1) National Treasure and (2) National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets. My purchase was sold by ""CG Movies and Games"" and fulfilled by Amazon.com. My family loves these movies and both blu-rays worked well.

However there is a serious problem with this particular Double Pack product which other buyers have also noted. The Amazon ad states the ""Region"" for this Double Pack is ""All regions"" but this is ONLY true for the first movie. The second movies is ""Region B"" only. This means that U.S. ""Region A"" blu-ray players will NOT be able to play the second movie. Amazon needs to update the description very badly.

I'm rating this product one star (the lowest I can) because of the grievous error. North American buyers should beware of this product unless they have a blu-ray player that can play ""Region B"" discs. If this product was correctly labeled, I would rate it five stars---at US$9.99 with free shipping, it is an excellent value.

There is a way around this problem if you use a PC to play your blu-ray movies. There is a Windows software product called ""AnyDVD HD"" from RedFox that can allow you to view movies from any region on a Windows PC. The program is not, itself, a media player so you will still need a blu-ray player program like PowerDVD Ultra from CyberLink. Running AnyDVD HD will make your DVDs and blu-ray discs appear to be region free so you can view them with your Windows PC and PowerDVD Ultra regardless of the region code of your PC's blu-ray drive.",1482624000,23,1548,4.621818181818182

5057699,3,B0076MWT7C,"Both of these films are great and certainly two of our family favorites.  That said, you can purchase both movies individually on Amazon for less.  At last check you can buy National Treasure and National Treasure 2 for ~$26 and for that you get a Blu-Ray and DVD copy.  The list price for this is $29.  Unless you have an issue with cases, I would certainly buy them separate.

Great films and highly recommend, just not this two pack.",1431043200,3,436,4.468354430379747
