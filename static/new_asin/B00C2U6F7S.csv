I LOVE VICENTE FERNANDEZ AS A SINGER AND ERNEST BORGNINE AS AN ACTOR.

THE LAST MOVIE ERNEST BORGNINE DID, WONDERFUL JOB DONE.

THANK YOU.",1370736000,4,173,4.896551724137931

8576748,5,B00C2U6F7S,"Nice last work for one of the big ones. Ernst Borgnine says good bye with a nice tale of redemption. It is cheesy and amateur, but his performance put the movie  at a different level. Being a latino nurse myself, and kind of a followers of rancheras, can totally relate to the position of these caregivers. I find some traces of ""The Wild Bunch"" in the story, from the ""gringo"" coming to the rescue, all the way to the ""last stand""",1475798400,,431,4.320987654320987

8576750,5,B00C2U6F7S,"First of all, is an incredible very well done and directed spaghetti western, the kind of which you don't get to see any more these days...!
It's a beautiful story, it has very funny smart moments, sad but sweet scenes, you will laugh and cry (but smiling all the time!)...

It very much worth to watch Ernest Borgnine's amazing performance in this, his very last film... He's brilliant!

The music is excellent and it takes and accompanies you through the scenes in a very special way! (you can get the soundtrack also, is really good!).

I'd say that if you want to watch a very good movie, well acted and directed, and very different than most of what's out there right now, you should see this one and won't regret at all!
I strongly recommend it!",1400025600,2,751,4.507352941176471
8576751,3,B00C2U6F7S,"To be clear the reason I chose this movie is because I was a stand-in for Ernest Borgnine as well as a participant in the  second card game, so naturally wanted to see the film. That said, I did enjoy the film and while it didn't make it to the big screen I thought it very entertaining and certainly worth watching. And for fans of Mr. Borgnine, the fact that it was his last film is reason alone to see it, The nursing home tyrant (Barry Corbin) is a delight to watch as is the rest of the cast members. The story line I thought uplifting in the sense that the grumpy/prejudiced old man (Borgnine) slowly transforms into a very human and kind person, while at the same time defeating the nasty old Corbin (Walker) who, incidentally, was as nice as anyone could be in person. I really enjoyed my conversation with him and with Ernie between takes. So pleased to have met them.  As an extra, we don't often intermingle with the stars on a social basis. I also became good friends with Carla Ortiz (Solena) and Arturo del Puerto (Aejandro) (We had a lot of fun on the set).",1390089600,3,1072,4.3283582089552235

8576754,1,B00C2U6F7S,"I was VERY unhappy about the movie I purchased. It ended up being very: ""Let me take these poor, pathetic Mexicans under my wing and protect them, since they're all helpless and can't do anything on their own."" All of the Hispanic characters lacked self-respect and were push-overs. It was very degrading to watch the ending. The whole time my boyfriend and I were watching it, we were expecting something to happen to help redeem the characters but that never came. I know that the trailer did make it seem like he was going to be their savior but we both thought that was just an exaggeration or that they were being silly but instead it was the most infuriating movie I've watched in a good while. My problem with it is with all of the Hispanic characters as well as the whole degrading plot, especially the whole last half of the movie. I couldn't believe the last scene... I found it to be very insulting as did my boyfriend. I'm Mexican and he's white, so it's not that I'm just being touchy about it because my boyfriend isn't even Hispanic and he couldn't believe how the movie depicted ""all"" of its Hispanic characters. Then there's the whole Vicente Fernandez plot.. I know it was meant to be funny and was the first time or two, but Borgnine went on repeating the same story and information to them multiple times on end and they still continued to ask him to answer the same questions or repeat the same information. They were honestly like children in all aspects.

I could not be more displeased with my purchase.",1379030400,3,1527,4.532608695652174
8576755,5,B00C2U6F7S,"If you love Ernest Borgnine, you must see this film. It's an Oscar caliber performance. It is also a fun film, with great beginning credits that spoof the credits for The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly",1372550400,3,198,4.378378378378378
