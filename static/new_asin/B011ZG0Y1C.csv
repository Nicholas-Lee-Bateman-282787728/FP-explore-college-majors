8725198,1,B011ZG0Y1C,The movie was far too short. The filming was poor quality. The actors were not well selected. The story line was not well written.,1516838400,,130,4.458333333333333
8725199,1,B011ZG0Y1C,"Horrible!, I can't understand the five star ratings!  My friend watched it with me and we both thought it was terrible dialogue and acting.  The child sounded like he was reading unnatural lines through out the entire movie.  It was hokey beyond belief.  The concept was good, if they had written lines that sounded natural and realistic. It wasn't B rate, it was z rate!  Don't waste your money!",1512518400,,396,4.681159420289855
