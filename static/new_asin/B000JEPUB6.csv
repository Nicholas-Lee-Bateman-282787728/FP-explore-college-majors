8150086,4,B000JEPUB6,"[Special Mission Lady Chaplin - Widescreen presentation - (1966) - Italian made, dubbed in English]  In this third installment of the 077 series starring Ken Clark as CIA agent Dick Malloy, the Cold War story revolves around a mysteriously sunken ship called the U.S.S. Thresher, armed with 16 nuclear-payload Polaris missiles that he's sent to retrieve before they fall onto the wrong hands. The ship lies 2 miles below the surface on the ocean's floor, and a submarine and various mechanical devices are used to get him there, only to find out that the missiles are already missing from the wreckage.

Kobre Zoltan (Jacques Bergerac), a wealthy, power-crazed egomaniac who owns an underwater salvage company, is the only culprit capable of the theft as he has the expertise and resources to do so. Agent Malloy globe-trots through New York, Madrid, London, Paris and Morocco to track the missiles and Zoltan down, and keeps running into a beautiful femme fatale named Lady Chaplin (Daniele Bianchi, from 'To Russia With Love') who remains one step ahead of him as she thwarts his efforts and piques his libido. But what are her true motives and where does her allegiance lie? Non-stop action, great dialogue and exotic locales will ensure boredom never takes hold as the details develop and story unfolds.

And if that weren't enough, there's enough eye-candy on display to make Willie Wonka envious. In addition to the sumptuous Daniela Bianchi, who looks scrumptious in around a dozen wigs, fashions, bare skin, costume changes and disguises throughout, we're also treated to the buffet of beauty of statuesque Evelyn Stewart (aka Ida Galli), the enchanting Eurovixen Helga Line and memorable Mabel Karr, as well as several fashion shows of 60's female form-flattering fiestas of fabulous excess. Women never looked better than they did in the late 60's / early 70's, IMHO. And here's your proof.

This flick is hands down my favorite of the three releases ('Mission Bloody Mary', 'From the Orient with Fury' and this one) as it's got everything a great Eurospy film should have, and then some. Ken Clark is at the top of his game here and Albert De Martino deftly directs the proceedings from start to finale. I hope Dorado Films releases 'The Tiffany Memorandum' and completes the Ken Clark series soon. The audio is sharp and coherent, the video crisp with brisk colors and solid contrast for a film that hasn't been re-mastered, there are lengthy trailers for around a half-dozen Eurospy flix as well as cast and crew bios. All aficionados of these films need to make a 'Special Mission' to seek this one out.",1305590400,,2617,4.954441913439635
8150087,4,B000JEPUB6,I had only read about this movie but was very interested. I will tell you I was not dissappointed. It is a fun film with some great scenes. I saw stunts done that would later influence Bond films and others. Ken Clark is good in the role of Mallory 077. He is a good action hero. The movie may not have been done on a large budget but every scene is well developed and looks good. Transfer may not be the best but it also may be that the source material is not in great shape. I recommend this film to anyone into spy movies and the 60s spy craze.,1305504000,,547,3.981818181818182
8150088,5,B000JEPUB6,"This third 077 release from Dorado Films is an absolute joy to watch. Ken Clark has to compete with 2 gorgeous Euro actresses- 'FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE'S' Daniela Bianchi and Evelyn Stewart aka Ida Galli plus a surprise villainous appearance from Jacques Bergerac. If your a fan of Euro Horror, you will see an appearance from Mabel Karr who was magnificent in Jess Franco's horror classic 'THE DIABOLICAL DR. Z' and a cameo from the stunning Helga Line who was also in the first 077 adventure. The plot revolves around the theft of Polaris missiles from an American Naval ship but the eye candy and action sequences make you forget about that until the climax.  Genre Director Alberto De Martino who touched every subject from sword and sandal, spaghetti westerns, and horror (my favorite is 'THE ANTI-CHRIST' aka 'THE TEMPTER') keeps things moving at a breakneck pace.  Bianchi's character Lady Chaplin resembles a future spy classic, the Raquel Welch character 'FATHOM'. She's a master of disguise and deadly weapons expert, too bad she's on the wrong side but you will love her any way. Bianchi also teamed with De Martino in Sean Connery's brother Neil's opus 'OPERATION KID BROTHER'.  Clark really gave Sean Connery a run for his money in the action department as he throws himself in the role of Dick Malloy with visual aplomb in the continuous fight scenes and unbelievable set pieces coming his way.  Although I will always prefer the first 077 adventure 'MISSION BLOODY MARY', this one is neck and neck in the entertainment department and highly recommended.  With a atmospheric Bondian music score by Bruno Nicolai and a crisp colorful transfer(alas, not widescreen), Dorado Films delivers the goods once again.",1284163200,,1720,5.0
8150089,4,B000JEPUB6,"Third and best of the cinematic adventures of Dick Malloy alias Agent 077. This is directed by Alberto De Martino and stars Ken Clark plus the gorgeous Daniela Bianchi in the title role. Although I'd have preferred a letterbox ratio instead of the widescreen adopted for this edition, the quality of the image is rather good and the sound ok. In English with no subtitles.",1269820800,3,372,4.7384615384615385
8150090,3,B000JEPUB6,"The last,and best 077 spy thriller,starring Ken Klark and Daniela Bianchi.
(A great couple!)And a superb supporting cast(Jaques Bergerac,Evelyn Stewart)
The film is entertaining,actionpacked, and gorgeus to watch,with fantastic
settings and beutiful locations, with (as always)a great score by
Bruno Nicolai.
You can buy all three 077 films from Dorado Films ,in superb quality dvd,s
They are all good,but this one is defenitly the best,with ""mission bloody
mary""as a second best,while ""From the orient with fury"" is a bit
disapointing,but well worth watching! If you love the james Bond movies
from the sixties like i do,then you,ll have to add theese to your collection!

8150091,5,B000JEPUB6,"Special Mission Lady Chaplin comes from the genre of films called Eurospy. These films were mostly filmed in the 1960's and were usually quite low budget action films featuring actors most people have never heard of. Often shot and financed in european countries such as Italy, Greece, Germany and France the majority were low budget wannabe James Bond films hence the convention of labelling them as Eurospy. Quality ranged from pretty poor to pretty damned good and there is an avid group of people who seek this genre of film.

Special Mission Lady Chaplin is the creme de la creme of Eurospy. Ken Clark is the hero who crosses sword with the films titular anti-heroine Lady Chaplin - played by the gorgeous Danilea Bianchi. This film has it all, a suave super agent, a stunning leading lady (as well as a gamut of others), euro locations galore, action, double cross and intrigue. What more do you want from a budget film?

Special mention must also go to Dorado films who have lovingly restored this film. Most Eurospy films are only available on the grey market where grainy image and intrusive subtitles rule. All kudos to the company for not only producing a great print of a great film but also packing the DVD with a selection of trailers from the same genre.

If you have only the slightest interest in spy or action films then you would do a lot worse than investing in this gem. If you already are a Eurospy afficiando then this is a 'must have'.",1185494400,13,1459,4.625482625482626
