8758636,5,B01EGQE8BU,"This documentary, filmed in Africa, traces the expedition of two explorers through the African bush. Billed as the Strangest Adventure Ever Filmed, I found it fascinating to view all of the major African animals in their natural habitat and several African tribes going about their daily business. There are also several hunting scenes, both by the animals and the native tribesmen. Animals kill humans, and humans kill animals. For the time period, even with some corny dialogue, this is a well done documentary. If you have an interest in the animals and the tribal culture of Africa, I would highly recommend this film",1526083200,,621,5.038834951456311
