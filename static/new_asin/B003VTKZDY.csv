8407098,3,B003VTKZDY,"For the English version, it sounds as though the narrator is reading in a very, very British accent - very monotone. The colors could be brighter.  I really think this was previously a set of VHS tapes from the early 80's and even though it was good for teachers then, Today's students need updated pictures and a more interesting sounding narrator.  Lots of clips on everything one would teach in the Humanities or Art History.  Lots of art, sculpture, and architecture through the ages.  I only use it if I can't find anything else.  In fact, my students would rather see my homemade PowerPoint presentations then see the DVD.
I would recommend it to a new teacher who isn't familiar with the subjects.",1373068800,2,704,4.691056910569106
8407099,4,B003VTKZDY,"Very cool series. The camera really lingers on the art, panning along slowly. Would've given 5 stars but there are some odd things going on with the narration. Its assumedly translated from German and in some places it doesn't synch properly with the subject matter being shown. It seems that some comments were also dubbed in afterwards to make corrections and this can be somewhat distracting. Nevertheless, the footage is awesome.",1356825600,2,433,5.112676056338028
