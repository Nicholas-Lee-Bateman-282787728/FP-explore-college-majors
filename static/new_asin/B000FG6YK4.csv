8122015,5,B000FG6YK4,"This is a great DVD; an opportunity to see a master of jazz guitar in a casual & informal setting. The information Gene imparts in this DVD can keep a student jazz guitarist busy for years; besides that, there is some beautiful solo jazz guitar playing here. Gene is not only a master of jazz, but has considerable command of the classical guitar technique. Whether you are a student or a fan of jazz guitar, this DVD is well worth getting.",1439942400,,440,4.444444444444445
