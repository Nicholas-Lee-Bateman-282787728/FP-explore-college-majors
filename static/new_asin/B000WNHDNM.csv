8224344,3,B000WNHDNM,This is about a 40min video and it demonstrates very well basic maintenance on your bike. But there's maintenance books out there with lots of pics that'll explain more in depth with more details. It is a great video though.  Try and get it used if you can.,1295222400,,257,4.354166666666667
8224345,5,B000WNHDNM,"Not being much of a mechanic my self, I really liked this video.  It not only explained the hows but also the whys.  If you are expecting to learn how to do a complete engine rebuild, then this is not for you.  Its just as the title implies... it just teaches you the basic fundamentals of maintaining your own motorcycle so you don't have to take it in for regular services.  Which has already saved me some money as a routine service at my regular shop goes for $90.  I would recommend this to anyone who is unsure of the basics.",1288224000,,531,4.217821782178218
8224346,1,B000WNHDNM,"This video shows how to check tire pressure, drain engine oil, use the phrase 'go ahead' in every instruction.  If you don't already know what is contained in this video, you should not be riding a motorcycle.",1287792000,2,209,4.648648648648648
