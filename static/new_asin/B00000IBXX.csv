8327359,5,B00000IBXX,"I am an artist/painter and I love this documentary.
It is my favorite J.P. so far. I love the man and his paintings and this covers him and his work with grace and poise. It captures his magic and his misery with out spinning out of control through sensationalism...it remains focused and grounded. Like all documentaries, it's up to the people chosen to speak up with eloquence,grace,humility and truth to make their subject shine and they do so here. It is worth buying the vhs if you care about Jackson and his work/spirit...E.M.",1302480000,,532,4.731182795698925
