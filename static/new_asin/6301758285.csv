7814486,3,6301758285,"I was about to say this movie is pretty good for low-budget hillbilly horror; but it has appearances by John Saxon and Ray Walston and a cameo of Evander Holyfield, so it must have had a larger budget than most indie horror.

Surprisingly good story of an unsuspecting family hijacked by hillbillies who run an auto salvage yard and human organ farm for black-market buyers.  So, yeah, these rednecks cause ""accidents"" on the highway, tow in the vehicles for salvage, and keep the travelers perpetually sedated for organ harvesting.

Which is fine and dandy until the head of the clan (Jake) takes a psychotic liking to one of his crippled victims (April) and decides to heal her using revivalist prayer, power tools and down-home spinal fluid injections.

Now, that's a good story.

Riddled with plotholes, continuity errors, and audio problems (sounds like all the dialogue is being piped through a phase-shifter or a flanger for about 15 minutes, early in the film).  The audio problems could be a product of the digital transfer, I suppose.

Creepy atmosphere, creepy characters, and just the right balance of levity to gravity, although it does demand a major suspension of disbelief on your part.  For example, a girl who has been a paraplegic her whole life can suddenly walk AND drive a Winnebago recreational vehicle?

The story in all was pretty good, I loved the overall atmosphere of the movie. It reminded me a lot of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre/Wrong Turn type movie. The movie did have another brilliant performance by genre superstar John Saxon. The movie, while staying creepy as hell, added a lot of fun and humor, without going way too far. I really enjoyed the two redneck sons, they really added a lot of humor to the movie and it made the really slow parts easier to watch.

[the bad]
The movie was really tame, there were scares, but nothing to write home about. Barely any blood, and very few deaths. Realistically, none of that really took away from the movie. The movie is marginally good, but with a good amount of deaths, blood and gore, the movie could have been a genre/cult classic.

[final thoughts]
The movie in no way is great, and it isn't bad. It's just another movie in the endless stack of direct to video snoozers. The movie did have a very short theatre run, from what I understand, but was jerked out of the theaters with an abysmal opening weekend. The movie had a lot of good parts in it. The two redneck sons, both idiots, one dumb, the other wise-cracking, added a lot of humor. When I watch movies like this, memorable characters always gets be back to watching the movie again. This wasn't much different. I have seen it many times, and continue to be a guilty pleasure of mine. The movie did have some cameos too, one by the late Ray Walston, and the other by Evander Holyfield, who was also the Executive Producer of this film. If you can get your hands on this for cheap, do so. Even though it is nowhere near being a great classic, it's one of those movies that you sort of want to watch every now and then.",1090022400,6,1742,4.390092879256966
7814495,1,6301758285,"Some movies are just bad. So bad, in fact that you feel sorry for the people who are in them, because you know that they know the movie they are in is a complete turd. This is one of those cases. I can hardly believe that Ray Walsten actually has a cameo in this. Oh, how the mighty have fallen.",1079654400,,295,3.933333333333333
