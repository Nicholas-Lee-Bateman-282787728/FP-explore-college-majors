8196230,4,B000QGDXZC,"Oh, oh oh. Precious jewels from a master of music, completely on top of his game.

I give this one 10 stars out of five for the music and 1 star out of 10 for the videography. Very weak on video style and at certain points we are treated to how shall I say, too much detail. Like snot.

Since the music matters most, and commercial videos of Pharoah are not so easy to come, by I'll call it a 4-star out of five release overall, but beware.",1447372800,,440,3.9886363636363638
8196231,5,B000QGDXZC,I have followed P. Sanders ever since he played with John Coltrane. He is magnificent. This is an exceptional DVD. I bought the CD also but on the CD he introduces the other players in a most vibrant manner not done on the DVD. It makes me think the DVD was done on another night..(previous or next night) at the Great American Music Hall series.,1292025600,,346,4.338461538461538
8196232,2,B000QGDXZC,"I purchased this DVD because after finding myself listening to the CD sometimes twice a day, I wanted to see Pharoah in action.  I also wanted to use this to study his techniques and embouchure since I have been learning to play tenor myself.  I was disappointed that there were only two songs from the CD on this DVD.  I also thought that it was somewhat disgusting that while watching the third song on the DVD, there were numerous close ups of Sanders playing and you could see snot going in and out of his nose while he was playing.  Blow your nose Pharoah !  I purchased the John Coltrane DVD the same time I bought this and I think it is a much better purchase with about 9 or 10 songs on that DVD.",1231113600,,704,4.185185185185185

Although this is a dated performance, the energy is there. Mister Sanders puts out 200% in this performance and his sidemen are simply incredible. It is really ashame that there aren't any more of his live performances available, whether they are in the past or fairly current. He is truly an unbelievable performer.",1207353600,2,508,7.209677419354839
8196234,5,B000QGDXZC,"While this video isn't for the ""special-effects-MTV-generation,"" for jazz fans and musicians it will provide a straight-forward and mesmerizing demonstration of Sanders' musical genius and intensity.  The American Music Hall performances give a glimpse of the passion of Pharoah's live performances--and what a fabulous quartet!  (Sadly, Booker and Hicks have been taken from us, but this video preserves a hint of their fire and gifts.)  The haunting performance of Kazuko in the Marin tunnel shows off Sanders' phenomenal tonality and technique.  And finally, the interview with Herb Wong provides some rare insight into the mind of a performer whose live performances are musically expressive, but laconic.  This video is a joy to watch: may I have some more, please!",1201478400,5,770,5.436974789915967
8196235,5,B000QGDXZC,"The excitement of Sanders in concert and the extraordinary ensemble he always assembles have been finally captured on video. This is long overdue. In an ideal world, one DVD would be released annually to chart his range and explorations. I plan to share this with my classes as an ideal way of understanding and experiencing jazz at its height. The solos by all are exemplary and at white heat. An interview finds him describing his way of interacting with musicians, ideas, and building on his experience with Coltrane. One hopes that more will follow.",1183334400,18,553,4.8936170212765955
