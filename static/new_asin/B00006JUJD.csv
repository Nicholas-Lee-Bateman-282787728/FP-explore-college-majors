7970853,5,B00006JUJD,"Ever try to tie a knot by reading the instructions in a book?  Well...I have tried it many times and often not successfully.  A friend gave me this new DVD as a gift and it's absolutely the best answer to learning knots.  Watch someone who knows how to do it, give you extremely graphic instruction, is the very best way to learn a new knot.
I also like the knot testing and thought jim and kelly Watt presented the material with their usual porofessional style and quality.  (I've watched them on ESPN and OLN for years and really wish they would get back on television.  We need their programs!",1044576000,6,596,4.431192660550459
