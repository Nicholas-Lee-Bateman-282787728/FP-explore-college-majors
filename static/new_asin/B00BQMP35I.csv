8572721,3,B00BQMP35I,"I liked the movie, but the audio quality is quite poor and the video quality is so-so. I don't think it has been re-mastered at all. There is a lot of ""hum"" and fuzz in the audio and when you turn the volume up loud enough to hear the voices, the ""hum"" gets even louder. It can make it hard to hear all the dialogue. The picture quality is okay...it's not quality by any means, but it is very watchable.

I really liked the movie. If you're a 30s movie fan (especially early 30s), then I think you will like this. I'm a Conrad Nagel fan, so I especially enjoyed it.

PLOT SUMMARY: *SPOILERS!* Don't read if you want to be surprised!

The story is of a doctor (Nagel) with a drinking problem who exiled himself due to a failed surgery on a child and has been drinking himself into oblivion to run from the memory of it. He is able to help a woman with his doctoring and in turn she inspires him to start anew. Because of her, he gives up his drinking and starts to believe in life again. They are parted for a time, but then meet again. He discovers she is married...unhappily married to a philanderer. However, they are honorable in their relationship, keeping it only a friendship, although they do love each other. The husband's health begins to fail due to drinking, drugs, and wild living. The husband discovers that his wife is in love with Nagel and vows to destroy Nagel's career. However, when his heart is failing he takes what he thinks is his heart medicine, but he mistakenly uses the bottle next to it which is poison (his wife had bought it to use on herself). Neither Nagel nor the wife see this happen. The authorities arrest the wife, thinking that she poisoned her husband. It is only revealed at the end what truly happened when the ""maid"" tells the truth, as she was the only one who saw what happened.",1370908800,,1822,4.352941176470588
