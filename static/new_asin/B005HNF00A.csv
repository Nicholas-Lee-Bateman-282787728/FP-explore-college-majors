8473327,3,B005HNF00A,"Itami Juzo is a master filmmaker, and my three stars does NOT refer to his skill. Tampopo is my favorite movie of all time. I was thrilled to find this in Blu-Ray, but: The box design is misleading. There are NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES in this package. Sorely disappointed as I'm still a total shoshinsha beginner in Japanese. It's interesting that there are Japanese subtitles included, which helps me practice reading, but I really really really wish they had put on the English subtitles, at least for Tampopo where I already know there's a translation.",1464307200,16,550,4.861702127659575
