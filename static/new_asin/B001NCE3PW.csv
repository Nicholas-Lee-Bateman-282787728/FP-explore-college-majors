- Men's hook step
- Step in place

The Partnering section contains
- Leading a right turn
- Right turn with a duck
- Right turn with switch behind the back
- Broken left turn with neck caress
- Cross body lead
- Outside cross body lead
- Copa
- Copa with a wrap
- Shoulder check for followers
- Right turn with drop catch

and the Techniques and Tips section contains three selections
- Counting salsa music
- Hold Positions
- Maintaining Contact

The Patterns section has six patterns that are based on the techniques demonstrated in the Footwork and Partnering sections. They are arranges from the easiest to the most difficult. The patterns are first demonstrated with Silvia counting the rhythm and printed text indicates what technique is being used. Each pattern is broke down and then danced to the music.

The quality of the video and sound production is superb. The background and the lighting are chosen so that the moves of the dancers are clearly visible.

I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD to all my fellow beginners salsa dancers.",1312243200,3,1677,4.60738255033557
