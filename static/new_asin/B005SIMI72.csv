8485184,4,B005SIMI72,I bought this DVD for my husband as a gift.  He had recently read a biography of Leonard Cohen but wasn't that familiar with his early work.  He really enjoyed this a lot.,1391385600,2,171,4.151515151515151
8485185,3,B005SIMI72,"I was thrilled by the first hour of this documentary and looked forward to its coverage of my favorite aspect of Cohen's career, the use of his music in ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" (1971), which put him on the map for me and thousands of people, and remains, today, my favorite use of pop/rock music in a film (and I include ""A Hard Day's Night"" in that assessment). Warren Beatty muttering to himself in the rain of the Pacific Northwest with ""The Stranger Song"" playing is one of the great moments in the history of film. Ditto for the movie's use of ""Winter Lady"" and ""Sisters of Mercy."" Much to my amazement, the documentary skims over ""McCabe"" in 30 seconds. Literally 30 seconds. No word on how Cohen felt about ""McCabe."" (Even if he has never expressed an opinion on this topic, THAT fact is worth noting.) No quotes from talking heads about the film; nothing from, for example, the critic Greil Marcus, who wrote about the use of rock music in movies for the first edition of Rolling Stone's history of rock 'n' roll. (Maybe Marcus was not available. There's gotta be someone in the world they could have found for the gig.) No clips from ""McCabe."" (Well, that's forgiveable, Hollywood charges outrageous sums for using clips, and this documentary was clearly made on a modest budget.) No mention or examination of the fact that, as Robert Altman wrote the ""McCabe"" script in Paris, Cohen's first album played on a portable stereo in the background, which shows that Cohen's work is not merely tacked on, it was an organic part of the creative process, it shaped the movie project from the start. (I love that!) Nothing about any of this in the documentary. Zero. Zip. Nada. This is a major, inexplicable hole in an otherwise good film, and caused me to dock the picture by one star. That said, the film has good things going for it. Great archival footage of Cohen in the '60s and '70s. The talking heads are well chosen including Robert Christgau, one of America's best rock critics, who, so far as I know, rarely consents to appearing in a film of this nature, and is funny, earthy, and informed. The talking heads invariably speak very well, which is a testament not only to them but to the interviewer(s).",1372377600,,2215,4.624365482233503
8485186,5,B005SIMI72,"It only earned a 4 star for quality but it so reminded me of U2s Boy concert I went to in the early 80s that I had to give it 5 for the insight it gave me of why they became such big stars. There was a glitch Spies, he threw away his harmonica after messing up in Don't Panic and some of the lighting was not real good but as I said this was when they were pretty new. 2 concerts: the first on Germany Rockpalast had Spies, Don't Panic, Bigger Stronger, High Speed, Yellow, Trouble (spider web song),Shiver, and Everything's Not Lost. The second is French on I think Sol. Again, Spies, Don't Panic, High Speed, Bigger Stronger, Yellow, Trouble, Shiver, Everything's not Lost, You only live twice. Get it, play it endlessly (I could listen to Spies and Trouble 1000 times), and cherish it. The French Concert was even before Parachute had been released...shu",1371600000,,857,4.464968152866242
8485187,3,B005SIMI72,"While there is an error on the back cover with regard to the name of the debut album, (repeated above in the Editorial Review) that was likely done by someone other than those who produced the DVD itself, as the DVD goes through the early albums in detail, and there is no error about the debut in the DVD itself.  There are interviews with producers, an engineer on an album, music critics, one of Cohen's back-up singers, and others.  This is more about comments and opinions, by those involved or who have an interest in Leonard Cohen.  It gives a little background on the early albums, if, like me, you are going to go back and get them.  I bought the Complete (at the time) Studio Albums Box Set of 11 albums and his newest since, along with a number of live albums, based mainly on watching ""Live In London"" and ""I'm Your Man.""",1366675200,,833,4.3896103896103895
8485188,1,B005SIMI72,"The creators of this unauthorized film did not do enough research to find out that ""Songs from a room"" was NOT Leonard Cohen's debut album (as the brief product description suggests in error). Is there reason to believe that the information contained in the DVD itself is any better?",1324857600,,283,4.795918367346939
8485189,5,B005SIMI72,This DVD arrived undamaged.  It was the same condition as described and when played the quality was great with no damage.  I'd purchase from this seller again.,1324684800,2,159,4.851851851851852
