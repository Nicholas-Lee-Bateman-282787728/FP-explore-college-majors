2697829,4,B000KWZ1UM,"Robotech: the shadow chronicles is a great production and an attempt by true Robotech fans to begin a new chapter in the saga while keeping to the spirit of the original in the best way they could.

This movie is NOT an attempt to bring in new fans to Robotech. It is made specifically for die-hard Robotech fans and you need to know your history to get the most out of it.

This movie is specifically a follow up to 2 things: it is a retelling/re-interpretation of the final episode of Robotech: New generation from different perspectives with many gaps filled in.

It is also a follow-up to The proposed Robotech: The sentinels series of which only 4 episodes were filmed. In fact this film is a follow-up to the Story from the ENTIRE Sentinels series that was never filmed so only those that read Jack Mckinney's Sentinels series will get some of the lines.

LET ME DISPEL SOME RUMORS RIGHT NOW:

The Shadow Chronicles was made as an attempt to start a new Robotech saga and was INTENDED to be open-ended. It is a COMPLETE movie.

Also, It was intended to have ALL the surviving Macross characters in it and be a true homage but the japanese Anime company that put out Macross Plus, Macross Zero, and Macross 7 own the rights to many characters and REFUSED to let Harmony Gold put them in the Shadow Chronicles.

Here is the list of characters that had to be written out of the Shadow Chronicles: Lisa Hayes, Minmei, Max and Miria Sterling, Dana Sterling. it is a real shame since the actress that plays Lisa Hayes was already onboard the Shadow Chronicles when they found out they didn't have the rights to her!",1170633600,7,1615,4.510273972602739
2697830,3,B000KWZ1UM,"This was supposed to be a new series, but they weren't able to finish it and edited what they did have into a movie. The same thing happened twenty years ago with Robotech the Sentinels.
The best thing Harmony Gold could have done, would have been to simply buy three more similar Japanese TV shows and splice them together, reedited to create continuity with the original series. It worked the first time.
The reason the original Robotech was great was because Harmony Gold did not create it in the first place.
So there is no reason to think this would be as good as the original, since none of the original Japanese writers participated in the development of this story. In response to all the fans of the original who were dissapointed
by the unresolved SDF-3 storyline: Catch a clue folks. There is no resolution to this because the original Macross
show contained no such storyline. It just ended. Everyone who watched this show in 1985 knew that, like
Macron 1 and Voltron, Robotech was made of three shows that had nothing to do with each other. Keep your expectations realistic and you will not be dissapointed. Rick and Lisa cannot return at the end of Robotech because they never went anywhere in the original Macross show.
Macross, Mospeada and Megazone (the OVA used to create Robotech: The Movie) have all had several sequels and spin offs in Japan. These are what Harmony Gold
should have purchased to make a new Robotech, but they squadered the opportunity.
Speaking of Robotech: The Movie. This really needs to be released in North America. It has become legendary,
and, even if it is bad, Robotech fans in America deserve a chance to see it. (Bootlegs are available, but look and sound awful.)",1170547200,5,1711,4.725752508361204
2697831,4,B000KWZ1UM,"A quite good, if not perfect, sequel movie to the Robotech TV series has finally come to DVD. The production values are very good considering the film's low budget, and the story is excellent. It does suffer somewhat from the relatively short run-time; there is not quite sufficient time for us to get to know characters sufficiently to care as much about them as we should. Nonetheless, given the limitations of the form, the Harmony Gold/DR Movie production team has done just about as good a job with the material as they possibly could have.

As for the DVD itself, the audio and video transfer is extremely good; I didn't spot any obvious glitches on my own equipment. The disc's only extra worth mentioning is a 45-minute featurette on the making of the film. It would have been nice to have an audio commentary and deleted scenes, but what is there is a lot better than anime DVDs usually get.",1170028800,6,900,4.625
2697832,5,B000KWZ1UM,"I saw the movie at the korean film festival and I have to say this is a great follow of a classic anime film that was very popular back in the 80's.  I have not kept myself updated to Robotech for 16 years but after gaining interest in old tv shows, Robotech happened to be the one that never got a ""proper ending"" leaving you back for more. To my surprise director Tommy Yune has been working on the production for some time and now the long awaited sequel unveils questions that were left unanswered in the past. We finally know the fate of the original protagonist, Rick Hunter, who is now an aged admiral and the leader of a new generation of freedom fighters. Later on we see new characters that bring a colourful essence that reminisces the charisma of old characters from the old series. There's a new edge and twist that makes you want more after watching this movie.

The Bonus feature is a 45 making of the film and discusses in a very detailed manner how the whole process came about. We get to see some of the voice actors such as Greg Snegoff (voice of Scott Bernard), Mark Hamill (Commander Taylor & Shadow Dude), Chase Masterson (Janice Em), Yuri Rowenthal (Marcus Rush) and many more great voice actors that made the movie admirable to notice its quality production. I've watched the DVD version on my TV Flat Screen that has a nice surround sound. The whole sound quality along with graphics are SUPERB!!  The music score done by the Scott Glasgow orchestra is SIMPLY AMAZING. Some pieces of music did remind me of the symphonic feel from the Castlevania Symphony of the night soundtrack. Everything seems just like a classic Robotech episode... Just a bit more updated for today's standards. There's Romance, Action, Betrayal, Struggles, Epiphanies, and Tragedy. It's a nice piece of work to have in your DVD Collection.",1169856000,8,1838,4.649230769230769

If you haven't watched it in a while, I highly recommend watching the last three episodes prior to watching the new movie.  Takes many elements of the ""Sentinels"" plot as well as elements from the McKinney novels, but doesn't follow them very closely (that's a good thing).  I was very pleased with the movie.  It does have the feel of a ""pilot"", but really, that's exactly what it is.  It introduces a host of new characters, and has several returning characters from the original series and ""Sentinels"".  Almost the entire original voice cast return for this movie.  New voices include Mark Hamill and Chase Masterson.  The Invid are there, of course, but it also introduces a mysterious new enemy.  Don't look for a strong conclusion at the end.  This wasn't really designed to be a stand alone product.

On its own it is well produced and entertaining, if nothing else. The story attempts to stich together the storylines of the so called ""3rd Robotech War"" and the return of the Macross fleet. While it leaves some loose ends of its own, it is well done considering the task.

Even in the 1980s, this feature was superior to anything comparable on american television.  Our science fiction animated series did not possess  the depth of this japanese series.  It had real emotion, and it treated animated science fiction as adult fare.  You don't see much of that in american productions of this genre.  The plot and characters were well fleshed out, the viewer could identify with them, and thier lives.  Yes, Robotech The Shadow Chronicles is violent, so were the earlier series, we unfortunately do not live in a peaceful world.  Bit I think this series is well worth buying, because it tops anything we in this country are putting out.  JRV",1389484800,,754,4.8359375
2697845,1,B000KWZ1UM,"If I could I would give this movie 0 stars instead of just one.

The Shadow Chronicles is very bad and painful to watch.

The original Robotech series is far better and I have watched the original series multiple times and immensely enjoyed it.

These are just some of the reasons why the Shadow Chronicles is so bad.

The animation quality of the Shadow Chronicles is very poor .

A large amount of the Shadow Chronicles uses CG but the studio apparently never learned how to properly modify textures so they have a cel style look when rendered and on how to properly adjust render settings for cel renders.  So we get CG that doesn't mesh with the other animation in the movie.

I am very familiar with 3D rendering and setting up 3D software to do cel style renders because of my job, and it isn't very difficult to do.  It can be a little time consuming to adjust and get shaders and render settings right if just one person is doing it though.

In the case of the Shadow Chronicles any modern animation studio ought to know how to do good CG that looks like cel style drawings.  It isn't difficult and isn't anything new.

Plus you don't have a lot of different CG object to work on getting the shaders right for from what I've observed and since the same 3D models are used again and again.

The animators gave every female character large breasts and altered the way many character look from the original series and what was done of the never completed Sentinels series.

The movements of characters is not natural looking and in some cases it is painful to see how little animation was done to them.

The lack of animation and natural movement is very painfully obvious in facial close ups when a character is talking.

Mecha also suffer from movement problems and all the space combat scenes look dull and boring because the animators didn't want to move the mecha around much and have them flying all around the screen.

Large amounts of well established Robotech lore set up in the original series and other official sources  is changed or ignored.

The film wastes a good bit retelling the final battle on Earth with the original series and greatly changes several key points and scenes from the battle and the last episodes of the original series.

It would have been better covering some stuff from the Sentinels story instead, as many characters and situations are based on stuff from the Sentinels that never got fully animated.

Your also expected to be aware of all the stuff Tommy Yune and others did in the revisionist Robotech comics that came out before the movie to catch and understand everything in it.

The voice acting is flat and dull.  Characters have no emotion and the lines are delivered in a boring manner.

Dialog doesn't mesh up exactly with the lip movement and animation of characters too in many parts.

This is very sad and surprising as I have heard several of the voice actors in the Shadow Chronicles do far superior voice acting jobs in other films and TV series they worked on and they got their lines to mesh with the animation.

One wonders if the actors just decide to not even try and give a decent performance, since the writers gave the characters dialog that is dull and juvenile.

Many of the voice actors are from the original Robotech series and they sound so much better in that then in the Shadow Chronicles.

I've read some of Tommy Yune, who is one of the writers, comic book work so I knew the writing would be bad , but I never could have dreamed it would be as bad as it is.

The directing is also bad, not surprising at all since Tommy Yune is also the director of the Shadow Chronicles.

The music isn't anything special, unlike the original Robotech series and what was done for the Sentinels.

If I had paid money to see this in a movie theater I would have walked out of the theater before it was even 1/3 done.  I had to stop the blue-ray several times as the movie was just so bad I couldn't take watching any more and need a break from it.

Finally, when you get to the end you find out that the story isn't concluded at all and that this is just the beginning of a larger story.

Hands down it is the worst movie I've ever seen.  And, I've seen many  bad ones, since I used to write movie reviews and go to bad movie film festivals in the past, which let me do just that.

In conclusion don't wast your time watching the Shadow Chronicles, you'll have a far better time watching the original Robotech series or reading the Robotech novels instead.

The characters and the history do not have the quality of the original series.

The battles are quite good. However, this movie could be erased of the Robotech history and nobody will remember it.

The animation is very good and there is enough happening to hold your interest for the 90 minute duration of the movie.  It ended abruptly for an Anime movie.  It was as if the producer yelled ""Cut!"" when the alloted 90 minutes was reached.

I was lukewarm to Shadow Chronicles.  It's a continuation of Robotech's endless conflict but it's too short to have any closure.  The humans realize that they have been hoodwinked and the story stops.  Other than producing a movie that hopefully will be profitable, I don't see any reason for producing it.  If you collect Robotech, it is another item for your collection, but if you don't, you probably won't find it of interest to you.",1355616000,,855,4.6466666666666665

For ppl who are lost this series follow the returning earth forces sent by Rick Hunter before the final battle with the invid aliens. This is the battle from their front it doesnt involve much of earth resitence besides a few people . This series gives a little more clarity into the invid series and makes a plot afterward.

I cant believe anyone would really care about those old cast of characters from the Robotech Masters or Invid in my opion,  those series was really lame and should be purge from the Robotech history.

This movie should have been the second installment of  Robotech and i wish they would have left the Robotech Masters  and that Invid Saga alone.  The difference from Robotech and Macross are those 2 crappy sagas.

I like the action sceens but i do feel the mechs didn't give me that  extra push in excitment as displayed in the orginal Robotech or in the Macross series but i must admit i never like the mech designs in the invid or robotech master period, they still make due though. The story has twist in it and there is the casualty of war feel throughout this movie, you really don't know who will die.

Overal i like the movie its x100 times better than that old Robotech crap they been producing it also have that Macross feel to it to. Its worth the time to watch it i actually came away hungry for more.",1338076800,,1584,4.303030303030303
2697902,4,B000KWZ1UM,"In doing movies from a major franchise, there are usually two kinds of approaches.  One, the movie is a kind of standalone side-story to the main source (such as the Appleseed movies).  The other is a continuation that is dependent on the prior installments (such as Star Wars).  Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles (which will be referred to as RTSC)  falls under the latter...it is a movie meant to continue the saga and initiate a new story arc in the Robotech.

CONTENT ISSUES FOR PARENTS AND OTHER INTERESTED FOLKS...
Well, with this film is actually pretty clean.  Language is pretty tame.  There aren't really any innuendos.  Also no shower scenes or stuff like that.  The only thing is Marlene does have a v-neck cut on her suit (though they don't really capitalize on that in a fanservice sense...it's just part of the costume, not meant to be fanservice).  The other thing is that for the unarmored space suits, they do follow the skin-tight suit models of something like Star Trek.  So if anyone is troubled by that, there you go.

TO THE MOVIE
I actually saw this movie in two different contexts...and I do think it makes a difference in understanding the experience a bit.  The first time I saw it, I was not very impressed.  It wasn't a bad film, but there were many ""holes"" in it.  It left me with many questions that weren't satisfied.  Plus the overall plot seemed generic.  However, the reason for this was because this movie is very closely tied to the Robotech series.  I had seen Robotech as a kid, but I didn't remember a thing about it (except the mecha and explosions).  But after seeing Robotech the series again this year, it sparked a new interest in re-watching this film...and my view totally changed.  Many of the perceived ""holes"" were not holes, but references back to the events in the original series...and the plot was much more interesting when put in light of what happened in Robotech.  All in all, I did greatly enjoy the film with that background.  As my title suggests, this is only a piece of a bigger picture...a painting is not fully appreciated by focusing on one single brush stroke, but the whole image.

Just my opinion, but I think RTSC is best enjoyed if one is familiar with the 1st and 3rd seasons/arcs of the Robotech series (you can skip the 2nd season).  This is because the film is not a summary or condensing of Robotech (as ""The Last Airbender"" movie tried to do), but a continuation.  In fact, the film begins at the time of the last 3 episodes of Robotech the tv series.  The film does take a small deviation from the what happened in the tv series, but it's not a bad one and is quite workable.  But enough about the plot.  I'm sure you would rather discover it yourselves.

GENERAL IMPRESSIONS...
I personally believe that this is a worthy installment to Robotech.  The spirit is still there, and so are many of the themes and issues that have continually been touched on through the original series itself.  Even the Mecha are still there!  Robotech has been known for it's character development, but unfortunately RTSC is not the best example for that.  But one must remember, compared to the 85 episodes the original series had to nurture the characters and story, a movie is simply not a lot of time.  Still, there are very meaningful developments that happen in the film.  Also, the characters, themselves, were quite charming and memorable.  The returning characters such as Scott Bernard and Marlene are pretty true to how they were by the end of the series, while the newly introduced characters aren't only amusing, but help add to the mythology of Robotech.  There's plenty of good action sequences and they stay pretty true to the dogfighting spirit of Robotech.

GRAPHICS/MUSIC/AND VOICE ACTING...
I must say, I really love the new updated look to Robotech.  The best part is that, they did not do an all-out change (such as the Mario movie did).  Rather, they used the original outfits and just modernized it.  It's tasteful, not too extreme, but very dashing.  The characters, themselves, though updated, still carry the same look and visual presence of the original.  Also, the blend of CG and normal animation was not bad at all.  It was pretty good and believable.  I did enjoy many of the environments that they created...but I still think they could have done more with it.  The music, was very good.  It's not memorable...but it definitely added to the atmosphere and events.  Also, the voice acting was quite well done actually.  They are quite expressive and represent each character well.  The only voice I can think of that might annoy some is Janice's.  But she is an android, which is why her communication is a bit stilted.

ALL IN ALL...
People who are not acquainted with the Robotech universe can find something to enjoy, I'm sure.  But RTSC is really a film that mainly caters to fans and Robotech familiars with it's use of many references and concepts from the 85-episode original.  I don't think that it is right to think about this as a ""movie"", but an extra-long pilot episode introducing the new story arc that Harmony Gold seems to be headed with the series.  In fact, they are working on another film to continue where this film leaves off.  Having seen the film as one who didn't know a thing about Robotech, and later as one who did allows me to say this about the film:  This is a good film if you are acquainted with the big picture, but if you are one who knows nothing about Robotech, you may not find it as tantalizing or intriguing.",1333756800,,5537,4.650515463917526

2697904,3,B000KWZ1UM,"note: slight spoilers ahead

While it's nice to see something new out of Robotech, I have to say I'm not happy with this film.  Unlike others, I didn't think the animation was really that bad and I'm not miffed about any changes to the continuity.  My biggest complaint is that the plot is just entirely too stacked against the humans.  Look at the end of Robotech the First Generation, humans face an overwhelming enemy armada but through determination and shrewd tactics are able to prevail at great cost.  Here, humans definitely would have lost except the bad guys took a look around, said this is too easy, and up and left.  Okay, so that's not exactly it but it's close enough.  Following this the humans proceed to get their butts kicked AGAIN by another enemy and then you get a cliffhanger ending . . . um, yay?  It's just not a very triumphant return.  I know they are trying to make things ""dramatic"" and set up a ""no-win"" scenario, but this is just too much.  I'm not surprised this project never got off the ground.  If you're really into Robotech, you probably will want to watch this just because it isn't all bad and the animation is (in my opinion) loads better versus the original show.  However, just don't expect too much.",1329696000,,1242,4.545045045045045

Let's break down why the movie is so bad.

1. This is a 90 min film, yet the first 30 min is just a retelling of the final part of the Mospeada/New Generation saga, leaving only the remaining hour for an original story.  It leaves little time to tell a decent story and unsurprisingly, it does not.

2. Terrible CG animation.  This came out in 2008, why does the GC look like something 10 years old.  Just for comparison in japan, Macross Frontier, which is a 25 ep TV series also extensively uses GC animation for the valkyrie and space battles...and looks infinitely better.

3. Flat characterization.  Is it sad that the most interesting character, Scott Bernard, is one of the few that we already know, and almost every new character is unlikeable or undeveloped, like Marcus Rush and Maia Sterling.  Oh yeah and in the Robotech Universe, why does every black character have to be related to Claudia Grant?  Are they not allowed to have their own original last names?

4. The Haydonites - worst, unoriginal, cliched, mustache-twirling sci-fi villains.

The worst part about this movie is not just the awful quality, but it's reflective of a fact few people know, that Harmony Gold, in being the exclusive rights holder for any Macross related releases in N America, have done their best to prevent ANY japanese market Macross shows to be released in the US.  Macross II and Macross Plus both were release more as a fluke and the fact Harmony Gold was in near financial collapse and couldn't afford the legal to fight those releases, but now that they have cash again due to Robotech DVD sales, yes, they'll continue to block the release of great series like Macross Zero & Frontier, and most especially, Macross DYRL.

Harmony Gold, not that you're listening, but please give it up on the Robotech license.  It did a great thing back in the 80s introducing a new wave of anime into the US that has been growing strong until today, but it's relevance in today's anime scene is kind of gone, and instead of letting it go away gracefully, you're milking this obselete license past death and also fostering a legion of aging fans who are also living in a state of denial.

Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles is a sad manifestation of this greed and denial.",1299974400,5,2579,4.736017897091722
2697958,3,B000KWZ1UM,"First of all, I'll be up front and admit I'm not a die hard Robotech fan. I watched it as a kid, although wasn't old enough then to really understand it. As an adult I went through the Macross Saga, and even The New Generation recently (still have to get through The Masters).
So I am something of a fan, just not die hard. And yes, I do understand the bulk of events that have taken place throughout most of the series, even the basics of The Masters.
But I do feel for the hard core fans. After twenty years wait, they get The Shadow Chronicles.
For anyone else who needs to be brought up to speed, in the Robotech universe, an alien spaceship crashes to earth, bring with it a bunch of ""robo-technology"", which the humans reverse engineer to build giant robots they can pilot, and even advanced interstellar ships. Years later, wave after wave of alien invaders come to earth looking for the power source of ""Robotech"": Protoculture.
The last episode of Robotech as a series shows one main character, Scott Bernard, leaving Earth in search of Rick Hunter, main character from the first ""saga"" in the Robotech series, who has mysteriously disappeared. The latest alien threat has vacated the planet, but Hunter is still missing. And then... nothing. That was the last episode. After many years and much red tape, a story is finally released to explain what happened.
What The Shadow Saga is is an 88 minute feature film, done with a ton of cgi (probably to the disappointment of many fans) featuring several characters from the previous shows, and introducing some new ones.
The film starts by actually re-writing some of the final episode of the Robotech series, and neglecting most of the cast that was in it.
The animation isn't bad IMO, and neither is the voice work. However, the plot is... well, it seems to be lacking something. It feels a little generic. The Invid, the bad guys from the last Saga, leave Earth. But a new enemy is realized when it turns out they've been manipulating events for years.
The final moments of this feature leaves us... hanging. We learn of why Rick Hunter disappeared, but he's still out there, and needs to be rescued (which the characters in this movie intend to do). And then it ends. It might not have been so bad had this story been continued, and from what I hear, Harmony Gold had planned on releasing a follow up film, but that, like so many other Robotech related projects, got caught up in red tape too it seems.
Overall, I'd just have to say this film was ""ok"". Definitely not spectacular, nor was it downright terrible. But it just doesn't capture the magic the imported anime had. As a stand alone, I can't imagine the casual viewer will be blown away. For even the casual fan, I think this may be worth a watch at least once.

2697960,2,B000KWZ1UM,"I became a fan of the Robotech series when it came out. I became sad when they did not take it further with new shows. I collected many of the RPG stuff and other things fans go for. I even got one of the Japanese books to MACROSS. When I heard of a sequel, I moved to acquire a copy as soon as I could.

I have seen it and I must confess  I have little good to say of it. Other than the imagery and scenes and background music which are superb, I think it stinks.

It is set during the final episodes of the Invid series yet deletes all but Scott Bernard, Ariel and the Invid Regis without explanation. Does not give any hint what might have happened to: Annie, Lunk, Rand, Rook, or Lancer and his invid love Cera. They have Louie Nicols from the Robotech Masters yet tell us nothing of what happened to Dana Sterling or any of his crowd. They have Bowie Grant's parents and Dana Sterling's Sister yet tell us nothing of what has become of them. Not a hint. They don't tell us what happend to any of the Zentraidi. They don't tell us what happened to the Tirolians and people of the Robotech Masters.

The story itself is pretty drab. The Earth forces win and drive out the invid but now they find themselves with a new and very treachurous enemy. An enemy who they believed to be a friend who now moves to wipe them out once they have disposed of the invid.

I thought the  dumbest scene is when the brother of Scot Bernard's late fiance,  Marlene, confronts Ariel. This guy is meeting an alien who is a dead ringer for his sister, one of the creature who killed his sister yet is pretty cool and calm about it, does not even notice.

Then there is the ending which I thought to be rather corny.

Overall, this thing, if they want to fix it, needs a sequel. A sequel in which they need to bring back more of the old characters to flesh things  out. They need to explain what happened to the old crews. They need to explain what happened and what has become of all the previous aliens. And then they need to go forward with a new series.

I personally feel the movie ranks 3.5 out of five, so I rounded up.  RtSC is basically the 88min pilot for what will become the next Saga of Robotech, adding a fourth to the previous three of the original show.  I consider it to be more of an OAV episode than a stand alone movie, and indeed HG is at the moment working on a new sequel, Robotech Shadow Rising, and a live action adaptation of the original series with Tobey Maguire and Warner Brothers.

My only real complaints stem from the fact that RtSC did not have nearly a big enough budget.  Lets face it, bringing back a dormant franchise after nearly 20 years is a risky business.  There are a few little things that could have been fixed, mostly minor animation problems or goofs.

On the whole RtSC is a fun start that came closer, I think, than anyone realistically expected to recapturing the elements that made the original so great and enduring.  If you are a Robotech or anime fan this one is a must, if you are curious, I would suggest starting with the original series first, then getting this movie when you are done.",1266537600,5,1236,4.4622222222222225

The drawn scenes are well done and pleasant, but the 3D scenes are inappropriate, unrelated. With those 3D effects, the movie feels like a cheap computer game.
I think 3D has no place in animation, except:
-- as a hidden tool to help setup and draw the scenes,
-- as an obvious tool to make a full-3D movie (as in Final Fantasy, Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, ...).
In any case, 3D or CGI is not needed.

To even begin to appreciate Shadow Chronicles for what it is, you MUST MUST MUST read the Sentinel novelizations by McKinney...

That being said... I liked the CGI/ traditional animation blend.  It reminds me of the animation style of Macross Zero... although, with Peter Chung's traditional (ugly) style of animation.

I'm not particularly a fan of Peter Chung's writing or storytelling, but he DOES give Robotech the political intrigue to put it on par with contemporary Macross equivalents.

My biggest problem is that this tries to do too much too soon, and there are severe character development issues in the film.
For the pre-established characters from previous RT series, its not a problem as it is assumed, however with new characters (not including those in the Sentinel's novels) they are not given adequate time for them to be redshirt fodder.

In that sense at its worst, Shadow Chronicles is like the horrendous HK English dub of ""Clash of the Bionoids"" that was released in the 80s... but when at its best (the last 2/3s of it) it is an amazing film that actually serves to separate itself from its Macross source material, and thrive as its own universe.",1260403200,10,1281,4.912037037037037

2698003,3,B000KWZ1UM,"Well I'm 36 now and watched this anime in the early 80s.  While I'm excited Robotech is back, I can't honestly say that The Shadow Chronicles was a good representation of what Robotech was and is to me.  As a kid I started watching this anime because I saw huge transforming robots during a commerical.  In the first few episodes I kept getting annoyed that they kept focusing so much time on the characters.  I was used to Gobots & Transformers.  Robots and actions.  What more could a kid want.  I almost stopped watching.  But soon I became hooked on the characters and couldn't get enough of them.  When the series ended I kept wondering what happened to Rick & Lisa.  I watched the Masters series & New Generations (I also liked this) but still didn't get any updates on my two main characters.

Well 20 years later, I still have none.  There is just not enough character development in The Shadow Chronicles.  I didn't find any of the characters to be likable even though I thought Ariel & Scott were likable in the New Generation.  The animation was sub par.  Do all the females have to look like they have implants/enhancements??  I think a good story can stand on it's own.  I'm quite fond of the animation in Appleseed. I'll probably keep buying future products from this franchise in order to support it in the hopes that someone, somewhere from any company will finally get around to filling in the gaps. To all the Robotech & Macross fanboys, yes I know it's three different series.  But who cares.  Anime is anime.  If I enjoy it, I'll buy both Japanese anime and American dubbed ones so that they keep producing it. Yes, I've seen all the Macross episodes. I have to agree with one of the other reviewers.  It's probably more Robotech in name than anything else.",1254355200,,1777,4.542586750788644
2698004,1,B000KWZ1UM,"I loved watching the original Robotech series in the '80s and then fell in love all over again by reading the novelizations in the '90s and now thanks to the DVDs I'm reconnecting with the series yet again in this decade.  So after rewatching the first and third generations I decided to watch ""The Shadow Chronicles.""  I wished I hadn't.

To say I hated this would be an understatement.  It's easily the worst sequel I've watched since ""Godfather III"" and the worst idea at prolonging a series since the Star Wars prequels.  I don't know how fans can like this except that cool transforming robots are involved.

Basically the first half-hour of this dreadful movie revises the battle for Reflex Point that ended the third and final generation of the original series.  It writes out the rest of Scott Bernard's team except for Ariel and also writes out Ariel's brother and sister Corg and Cera.  Depending on your point of view it also subtly changes the ending of the battle as the Regis doesn't destroy the REF fleet when she and her children leave.  (Some would argue she only destroyed part of the fleet while those like me who are fans of the now ""decanonized"" novels think she wiped them all out.  Logically, why leave so many of the Robotech Masters's weapons sitting around in orbit?  But that's one of those nerdy fan debates that will probably never be settled conclusively.)

After it's done altering the end of the show people remembered (without even the grace of labeling it an ""alternate universe"" like the recent big-budget ""Star Trek"" movie) it moves on to setting up the new plot meant to wring some more money from the franchise.  Stealing a page from ""Babylon 5"" among others, there's a new evil enemy known as Children of the Shadow.  What's most insidious about this enemy is that they helped design many of the weapons the humans used in battling the Invid.  It's really hard to battle an enemy with weapons they designed for you, as Scott Bernard, Vince Grant, and the new Skull Squadron soon learn.

Meanwhile, Rick Hunter and the SDF-3 are stranded in space, the Protoculture matrix they carry aboard being the only source of that strange yet powerful energy left in the universe.  The race is on between humans and Children of the Shadow to get the matrix first--the humans because all their weapons rely on the stuff and the Children of the Shadow because they want to eliminate all Protoculture from the universe.  (And considering all the trouble Protoculture has caused, who'd blame them?)

I have no idea if the sequels to this movie will actually be produced; you'd have to check with various fan sites for that.  I'm hoping not.  Besides tampering with history, the new plot was boring and cliche.  Except for Ariel, Scott Bernard, and Louie Nichols, really none of the main characters from the three series are involved in the story.  Instead it relies on characters from ""The Sentinels"" (a sequel TV series that was never produced except in novel/comic book form) and dull original characters who are merely echoes of the more iconic characters.  Rick Hunter does get a cameo (he almost literally gets to phone in his part) but looks so old that he's unrecognizable, despite the fact that he is only about 53.  (From reading the Wiki page about the prequel comic book series I know they made up an explanation for this, but really it was probably just sloppiness.)  So really if you were hoping for something to tie it all together, this isn't it.

Other people have noted the animation looks different and relies mostly on Korean animation and cheap-looking CGI for the mecha/ships.  This made the battles look more like the ""Battlecry"" video game than anything else.  Really I thought the CGI stuff looked blocky and dull, not far removed from the days of ""Tron"" or the Dire Straits ""Money for Nothing"" video.

Overall this is a cheap, shoddy project meant to separate fans from their money.  Don't be fooled!

2698071,1,B000KWZ1UM,"This film attempts to be a continuation from where the Robotech television series left off.  The first third of the film runs concurrently with the ending of the television series, but the scenes are shown from different points of view.  Also, characters who appeared in these scenes in the television version are conspicuously absent in the film version, and are only mentioned briefly in passing in the dialogue.  The only characters to remain from these scenes are Scott Bernard, Ariel, and the Regis.

There are some serious continuity issues between this film and the original series, as well as between this film and the Sentinels film.  For example, I have a hard time buying that Maia Sterling is Dana Sterling's sister.  There's just really no way for this to be possible, especially when you factor in Maia's age and just how high up in the ranks Maia is.  Another issue is the android Janis Em.  In this film, she is portrayed as being developed using Human and Haydonite technology.  However, in the Sentinels film, Janis was created by Dr. Emil Lang, and is strictly a product of Human technology.

Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles attempts to blend 2D animation and cel-shaded CG mecha animation.  However, this blending as its used in this film does not work.  These two animation styles do not mesh well, so it's very jarring when the animation jumps between the 2D and cel-shaded CG mecha animation.  The CG animation looks ""clunky"" and ""cheap"" (it looks more like what would have been considered ""top of the line"" CG animation about ten years ago).

There is a featurette included on this DVD called, ""Robotech: Birth of a Sequel -- The Making of Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles.""  Personally, I think the featurette was a little on the long side, and that some of the interviews could have been cut back on.

As a long-time Robotech fan, I was very disappointed in this film.  There's continuity problems, a weak story, and rather unimpressive CG animation.

If you're a Robotech fan who must own everything related to the property, then you'll want to acquire this film.  However, if you aren't, then it's best to avoid this DVD.",1214352000,7,2148,4.835616438356165
2698072,3,B000KWZ1UM,"Let's talk about what you actually see on the disk.

First, there's a 2 minute, 15 second Dragon Ball Z promotional spot. You can not skip it, you can not fast-forward through it, and you can not go straight to the menu. You can go to the ""top menu"" to skip it, if your DVD player remote has that button.

There are three items on the disk, the movie itself, a 45-minute behind the scenes feature, and some trailers.

The 45-minute behind the scenes feature contains alot of fans (many of whom are overweight) gushing about how much they love ROBOTECH. It made me squirm. Then the producers, directors, and writers go into a very long talk about the show's production history since 1985, the failed production of ""ROBOTECH 3000"" in 1998, and the production of the current feature. It is very informative. It is nice to see the faces behind the product. But it just seems very long.

The trailers are a trailer for this movie, and a few funimation trailers strung together (funimation channel, Galaxy Railways boxset, Origin: Spirits of the Past, Burst Angel, Fullmetal Alchemist movie).

The movie:
This film combines computer animation and cell animation. If that offends you (I don't see why it should) then you should skip this movie. Both types of animation are done at a moderate quality, so don't go expecting something on par with the Star Wars prequels. It's still a good film for something that didn't have a $100 million hollywood blockbuster budget. Many of the original voice actors return, and two celebrity voices are featured.

This show is a bridge between the end of the third part of ROBOTECH, the New Generation, and the next (unwritten) part of the saga. The battle for Reflex Point, the last two episodes of the New Generation, are replayed from the perspective of the returning expeditionary force as they take back the Earth from the Invid. The Invid queen, the Regess, recognizes the new enemy, who gave the expeditionary forces their new technology, and leaves Earth. The survivors of the expeditionary force then have their first battle with the new enemy at Space Station Liberty. The movie is fast paced - many events happen in a relatively short period of time.

This disc is a dual layer DVD. How can you tell? When the alpha-beta combos are flying towards Space Station Liberty for the first time (at the 1:01:02 mark), the scene may pause for a half-second while switching layers (depending upon your player). Most DVDs are dual layer these days.

This is much better quality than the New Generation portion of the old ROBOTECH series, but it is definitely not hollywood blockbuster quality. Still, it's nice to see an old series continued.",1213488000,2,2672,4.793478260869565

2698074,5,B000KWZ1UM,"I just finished watching this and I'd like to respond to some of the negative reviews. This is coming from a long time fan who used to watch the series when I was in grade school and has read the books and comics...

The computer animation - Yes, SOMETIMES it looked odd, but most of the time it was actually very crisp, fluid and just plain cool. I mean for god's sake, anyone that has watched the originals knows that were times when the mecha animation was weak or incongruent. I feel the CGI was a bold move, it worked, and it's only gonna get better..

The regular animation on this one is very easy on the eyes. The sound effects are top notch - some of which are on the level of Star Wars. The voice over work is leagues above the originals and for the most part the actors did a great job as did the editors.

The characters - I read some complaints about the characters being generic, or cliche, or not having an arc - the problem is that this feature is relatively short. They can only fit so much in there but the important thing is that it left me wanting more - isn't that part of what we loved about the originals?

The story as it pertains to the original story-line - Yes there were some issues with that and I wish they would have just tied everything together. Personally, I've just accepted the fact that the Robotech story-line is malleable. At first I was put off by this new enemy the ""Haydonites"", but on the bright side, the prospect of the  Invid and humans fighting on the same side is tantalizing (think of all the new human/invid hybrid mecha!). I guess then that the Invid mistakenly thought the Masters ruined their homeworld when really it was the Haydonites??

So at the end of the day, I feel we are definitely better off for having The Shadow Chronicles. I mean honestly, I never liked the whole ""The Robotech Masters"" section of the saga and I feel the SC ranks above that. This is still the best American mecha cartoon around...",1211241600,,1964,4.352459016393443

Things I truly enjoyed about the series would be the animation.  I also enjoyed the fact that the brought in the original voice actors to replay their roles.

The aliens intent is to tap into the Earth's supply of Protoculture, some sort of energy source. Frighteningly, Earth seems more imperiled by its saviors (who wish to rid the planet of Invids at any price) than they are by its alien overlords. Meanwhile, a romance has developed between one of the Earth men and an Invid princess, who likes to go around naked, shielded only by her brilliant glare. Will love find a way to save a planet? Or will ancient animosities (not to mention tens of thousands of recent battle deaths) make reconciliation impossible?

I'm not familiar with any of the RoboTech materials (and there seems to be lots of it) but this film did not prompt me to seek out any more. The film was standard Stars Wars fare, with lots of space ships and lasers and faster-than-the-eye-can-see space battles. The images combined decent computer graphics (for the ships) layered with standard cel animation for the characters. The plot, characterizations and voicing was standard American Saturday morning, except for the voice of an Invid general, which was vintage Darth Vader. The film had few if any manga/anime touches that would at least have made it fun to watch. Truth be told, I fell asleep about 45 minutes in.

2698128,4,B000KWZ1UM,"""Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles Movie"" is an enjoyable full-length movie (approx 90 minutes in length) that will entertain anime fans and those who enjoy the space opera genre. The film gets off to a somewhat slow start at first, with the opening music and shots signalling from the get-go that this will be a film heavily inspired by the early Star Wars film (that influence becomes even clearer as the film progresses).

The film starts mid-story, picking up from where the TV series left off. Thus there will be two kinds of viewers: those who have seen the TV series (all or in part), and those who are encountering this film without that background. Those who know the series will no doubt have little problem with the beginning, but newcomers may feel a bit as if they were watching ""Empire Strikes Back"" without having seen ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" first. Confused, in other words. Nevertheless, this confusion is not enough to make the film unwatchable, and after about 20-30 minutes newcomers will have picked up on the main characters and important story lines enough to relax and enjoy the film.

For oldcomers and newcomers alike, the film picks up steam and interest as it goes along, and improves after its slow opening. The plot is relatively simple. The Robotech force has amassed outside Earth and is ready to reclaim the planet from the alien species called the Invid, aided by Shadow technology provided by the Haydonites, another alien race and mutual enemy of the Invid. The drama centers around characters such as Scott Bernard, a Robotech officer who survived an earlier Earth-bound expedition and fell in love with an Invid girl, Marcus, a young Robotech pilot whose sister was engaged to Scott and who boasts about how many Invid he has killed, and Vince Grant, captain of the Icarus, who has to decide whether to trust Scott and his Invid lover or view them as traitors.

Previous attempts at making Robotech films have not met with success, but Robotech The Shadow Chronicles is a fun and watchable film that can be enjoyed by virtually anyone. Although it contains scenes of violence, as any space opera would, they are not graphic. It will also generate interest in watching the original series. The animation is quite good, although there is quite a lot of CGI that struck us as strange at the beginning, but eventually we got used to it.

Enjoy!",1204243200,2,2376,4.787804878048781
2698129,2,B000KWZ1UM,"What draws you in to Shadow Chronicles in the first place is the fact that this is the blessed continuation of the original Robotech series.  That maybe we can see whatever happened to characters from Generations 1, 2, 3.  That maybe we'll get to see what comes after The Sentinels.  Or how it fits with The End of the Circle.

What pushes you away is the poor treatment of those characters and storylines.  It's like having a favorite teacher and all of a sudden you get a substitute that doesn't know where things are, who your classmates are, and yet still bears the title of teacher.

The use of CG and new (read different) style of animation is debatable.  Yes, it would have been great for the characters to look more like they came from other Robotech-verse style anime.  Yes, the CG sometimes  looks at odds with rather than complementary to the hand-drawn.  But the emotional backdrop of characters' personal lives and motivations are found wanting here.  The new characters are intriguing only while they're onscreen and forgettable as soon as they walk off.  The nods to previous storylines feel like just that--nods.

That this movie holds potential and promise isn't enough to warrant being deemed a good movie.  It's when you actually deliver on that promise that makes it good.  And this, the reason that Shadow Chronicles is Robotech in name only.",1204156800,3,1363,4.789699570815451

Robotech - The Shadow Chronicles is an exciting movie for any sci-fi fan, not just anime fans.  I enjoyed it immensely.  The graphics were superb, a mix of CGI ships and drawn characters.  Although, as other reviewers have pointed out, the animation of the mecha is not fluid (and perhaps inconsistent with previous Robotech movies), I actually found the animation to be very -believable-.

This version is dubbed in English in a high-quality, natural manner, although in a couple of cases, the English voice actors struggled to speak the whole thought in the time the characters' lips moved.

The focus of the movie is on the characters, not the technology -- but that doesn't prevent the movie from including many exciting action scenes.  There are an interesting variety of characters and interactions between them, as the characters are of multiple alien races (including one female AI robot).

The plot is entirely independent and accessible to a non-anime, non-Robotech fan.  If you're a sci-fi fan who likes robots, space battles, and psionic powers, then you will enjoy this movie.  This movie is not particularly deep and is at times a little bit cheesy; I can see why it would be a let down for Robotech fans given descriptions I have read of the series.

I trudged through the film, which ended on a rather anti-climactic note.

This movie is obviously targeted to fans of Robotech. Is it the best entry point for a new fan? Definitely not.

From an animation perspective, the film attempted to mix 3D vehicles and backgrounds with 2D characters. I understand the reasons behind this move (it's cheaper to work with 3D than 2D), but the efforts come across as mediocre at best. The 2D animation was shoddy in several parts - lips barely moved, characters barely reacted to one another, and the characters themselves appear to be variants of the standard Manga-template variety. Coupled with lack of action, this film was metaphorically equivalent to watching paint dry.

Having read the Sentinels series as well as the final chapter, The End of the Circle, I could not wait to get my hands on this movie.

Alas, the early giddiness in which I found myself as I watched the movie soon gave way to that emptiness on Christmas morning when you realize that the one toy you really wanted failed to show up.  No, there is no Santa Claus this year when I watched this movie.  The creators wanted too much to put their own spin on the story - not thinking about what fans like myself would have wanted to see.

It chronicles a battle between three opposing (and sometimes cooperating) forces of humans and aliens, and is set mostly in space.

Of course Robotech fans will likely want to get this 2-disc set, but there are other audiences who may enjoy the movie as well.  Fans of sci-fi, animation, etc. might be pleasantly surprised by what Robotech has to offer.

From what I understand from watching some of the special features on Disc 2, Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles is a continuation of the Robotech series that began in 1985.  I never saw the show originally, so I can't comment on how the movie matches up with it, but apparently they had fans involved in the production, so I'm guessing they did a careful job.  The reason I'm admitting I was not a Robotech fan before watching this is to assure other non-fans not to be afraid; check this out.  You may quickly become a fan!

The visuals look great; your eyes will get a real treat.  Animation has come a long way in recent years.

Disc 2 is chock full of goodies, including a making-of featurette that shows real fans (at a convention) praising the show, trailers, a commentary, deleted scenes, production galleries, and a lot more.

Suitable for most children; there's some -- but very little -- potentially offensive material (a minor swear word or two, some blood and shooting).  This could be something parents and kids will enjoy watching together.  Very cool.",1198108800,,1570,4.901515151515151

It also takes place where the orginal series ended, so the story arc has a nice logical flow to it.

This latest installment (yes, I do mean installment) is a continuation in the mood and thread from way back in the 80s. The mood and feel of the animation are similar to the original, but I was left feeling that some of the original drama was missing. I cannot say where the product is lacking and maybe it is just a nostalgia for a younger more naive time in my life.

The story is well crafted as an installment in what will probably be an extended series. I could have wished for something a little more self-contained. I favor a methodology that makes each feature length cut stand on its own with the character continuity linking the stories. The writers/creators of Shadow Chronicles thought otherwise.

The voice acting was well done within the constraints of the dialog and plot. The animation was the best part of the product in my opinion, carrying the same feel as the original, and definitely linking this installment with the twenty year old prior threads.

I seldom venture into the extras on a DVD, but for the sake of a complete review I ventured. The result was that I was reminded of why I do not usually bother. Aside from a view of the promo for Robotech 3000 (which was a little cheesy for my taste) there was little of interest to me - fans and such recounting how the old series changed their lives, why the production staff did what they did for the current product, trailers and production designs and screen shots.

Essentially, I imagine that hardcore fans will find the Shadow Chronicles to be compelling, however, while I found it to be entertaining I was left somewhat disappointed.

The english voice acting is well above your average anime fair and once it gets cooking the action is nonstop.  The animation and CG mix is a bit unsettling visually looking like it wants to be 2 different styles.  There is a semblance of plot that I am sure means alot more to the fans than us newcomers but the storyline will probably be expanded upon further down the road so if you like it you can backtrack.  A good time for animation fans who appreciate good voice work (but hokey dialogue) the cosmic camradre on display here is infectious and I enjoyed the action scenes alot however as a fan of animation more on a whole I found many of the extras on disc 2 more engaging than the feature ultimately.

2698203,3,B000KWZ1UM,"Robotech was one of my favorite series as a kid.  The Shadow Chronicles brings back memories of the old shows but there are glaring weaknesses that plague it, primarily relating to the animation.  Simply put, the 3d animation is sub-par.  The models have very little detail and are blocky. The 2d animation is ok but not up to todays standards.  The dialogue and plot are ok and the extras are pretty worthwile.  Hopefully future releases will not skimp so much on the animation.",1197590400,,479,4.72289156626506

""Robotech: Shadow Chronicles"" is an all new animated feature from Harmony Gold, the company that brought you the original Robotech saga. This time around, however, everything looks better than ever! Rather than being a mash of three different Anime programs, this feature is entirely new animation produced with modern Anime feature standards in mind. A slick mix of CGI and traditional animation, everything looks highly detailed and very impressive. The voice cast is top notch and so is the music. The girls look great too!

Personally, though I am hugely into animation in general, I still only dabble in Anime (and I use the term uncomfortably, since this film was largely put together here in the States). Even though I was around 10 when the original series came on, I never watched it. I don't even remember it being on, though I've become aware of it in the many years since then. In other words, this was my first real exposure to an entire Robotech program. Initially, I was thinking I might be too bored with it, as so much of it seemed to be space battle action. Yes, I'm a huge Star Wars fanatic, but the space battles were never my favorite part of that saga. They're good, but a little goes a long way. However, after half an hour into Shadow Chronicles, the more human side started to come out as we got to know the characters a bit better. Not quite enough perhaps, but it managed to finally pull me into the movie. The film itself looks great, as I said before, and it's not impossible for the newbie to follow. They try to inform you a bit when it is important, and they do a decent job of it without going overboard. The film picks up during the final episode of the classic series and continues beyond it. Old characters take part, as do totally new ones. Of course, this will mean much more to the hardcore fans of the franchise. Overall, I'd say this should be great for the Robotech fan or anyone into stuff with major emphasis on space battles. Certainly, it would help to know more about the Robotech characters/world beforehand. Others may like it as well though, and it's worth giving a trial watch. I wouldn't mind seeing more of it myself if the characters and their relationships receive more attention.

The 2-disc Collector's Edition is surely the way to own this flick. It has a great Making-of featurette that gives newbies some insight into the original series as well. You also get a music video of the film's major scores, an excellent commentary by director Tommy Yune, screenwriter Ford Riley, and composer Scott Glasgow, a featurette from a con and an interview with the director, deleted scenes with or without commentary, outtakes, a trailer for the horrible and thankfully dropped concept that was Robotech 3000, animatics with or without commentary (including footage of Ariel in her glorious, uncensored form), trailers and some nice galleries. The case looks great too, except that it has that disc on top of disc setup. It even has a cool slip-cover! If you're a Robotech fanatic, it's a must own. If you are just looking to taste-test this legendary franchise, this is probably the best way to do it since the high production values will help hold your interest.",1197504000,2,3629,4.711811023622047
2698206,3,B000KWZ1UM,"Anime is a cultural phenomenon not because of its visual appeal (although its style and usually big-eyed characters are certainly distinctive) but because of its appeal to the human soul, particularly in that the characters are given time to interact on-screen, develop, and become ""real"" to us (a distinct part of Japanese story-telling that has bled into many popular video games and is also certainly present in manga).

The trouble, then, with this particular Robotech release, is that it does not capture or capitalize upon the strengths of the genre or even the strengths of the series, perhaps due to its target audience actually being American rather than Japanese.  Therefore, we see fancy special effects, lots of exposition at the beginning for those unfamiliar with the universe (like myself), but we don't see much character development.

Those who are fans of the Robotech universe will probably enjoy this release, including the extras copious extras, though they may be rather disappointed.  Those who are not fans will probably not be converted.

On perhaps a fickle note, I was annoyed at the inability to skip the ads (""previews"") that come before the production.  Not cool, Funimation.

I expect I will draw criticism for my frank assessment of the film, but keep in mind, I did give it 3 stars.  I don't find it to be ""bad"" by any means, but it does nothing to stand out or make itself worthy of a recommendation.  Unless, of course, you're a Mark Hamil fan.

I'm relatively new to the anime genre so there are lots I don't know about the history of this series and how it compares to others. I am, however, a movie buff with a huge home theater and state-of-the art sound system.

The Shadow Chronicles has a powerful, chest-thumping audio that is as good as anything Spielberg has produced. So all-consuming is it that you almost forget you're watching animation. Almost. The art isn't up to the quality of other more recent anime movies; the mouth movements, for example, are similar to old Saturday cartoons of yesteryear. And I didn't care for the subdued colors used throughout.

I thought the storyline was compelling and kept us interested. It was easy to understand, which isn't the case with some anime.

I wouldn't recommend buying it until you have seen it, especially if you're a connoisseur.",1197417600,,895,4.830065359477124
2698220,4,B000KWZ1UM,"I'm a huge Robotech fan and was very excited to see this movie and the extras on this 2-DVD set. I'd been a bit disappointed with The Sentinels (the few episodes they made) but I love the Robotech series and wanted to see how The Shadow Chronicles measured up.

The storyline for The Shadow Chronicles was better than I expected. The story takes up exactly where the original Robotech series ended, with the exodus of the Invid from Earth. Character actions and decisions are logical and flow smoothly. The overall story arc is cohesive and satisfying. As a writer, I was very happy with the plot and the characters.

I was a bit disappointed with the animation. While the original Robotech didn't have great animation, either, I thought there was a certain flow to the animation that seems missing here. I also didn't like the switch to computer animation from traditional animation during the mecha shots. It was a bit disconcerting for me, although viewers used to that kind of shift probably won't be bothered by it.

The extras are great. Robotech fans especially will enjoy the featurettes, deleted scenes, and the behind-the-scenes extras included:

Feature commentary
Birth of a Sequel featurette
Anime Selects featurette
Original Score Music video
Robotech 3000 Promo
AIPoN Anime Podcast
Deleted Scenes
Outtakes
Split-Screen Animatrics
Alternate Trailers

2698221,4,B000KWZ1UM,"It has been nearly 20 years since the United States was granted another high-quality adaptation of the Robotech series. Robotech did wonders to introduce an entire generation to the very best of Japanese mecha-style anime. By taking audiences into a heavily detailed science fiction world, we witnessed a story unfold that is laden with hope, tragedy, love, and inter-galactic conflict. Anyone who's ever stepped forward into the Robotech saga, or have glanced at the original Macross source, have become familiar with why the series has enjoyed so much success over the years. Every battle scene is a spectacle of chaotic beauty - hundreds of missiles wildly trailing all around and exploding around fast-flying advanced mechas (one that has become the series trademark). Each character is developed to have their own place in the unfolding epic, whether that of a war-hardened admiral calculating the lives of his crew, or that of a simple medical warden hoping that they don't have to see their loved ones shuffled through intensive care.

While existing in numerous adaptations and through various arcs, Robotech helped bring forward the joys of Japanese Mecha to American audiences. Each story was always re-introduced to us in high quality, with strong English voice acting and care to ensure that the sophisticated narratives ranging from brutal conflict to tender displays of love that were never diluted in the translation. Now that the long-awaited collectors edition of 'The Shadow Chronicles' has arrived, one would have two underlying questions pertaining to it.

1). Does `The Shadow Chronicles' keep true to the roots of Robotech, making a worthy continuation of the story from so long ago?

2). If so, is the Collectors Edition worth the extra money when compared with the Standard Edition?

After viewing the contents of this DVD, I am very well assured to say that the answer to question one is an emphatic ""yes""! New technologies have continued to emerge in entertainment ever since the 1980's - such a statement as obvious as oxygen. But, while most franchises and movies have become so overpowered and consumed by these technologies, it is refreshing to know that `The Shadow Chronicles' does not wish to do so. The visual presentation is crystal and concise - using nicely rendered CGI animation closely spliced in with the original anime style, taking good steps to subtly enhance all the high-octane battle sequences and various technical representations introduced throughout the movie. Though rendered in a much higher quality, old fans will still find themselves captivated by the same charm that drew them to Robotech when they first saw it 20 years ago.

Though it surprised me at first, the movie itself presents itself in two different ways. One, it is an alternative perspective on the climatic finale of the Third Robotech War, one in which the humans wage their final battle against the Invid, in an attempt to reclaim the conquered planet Earth. The first part of the movie mainly focuses on this sequence, except instead of showing the perspective of the battle forces on the ground, it focuses on the REF forces fighting in space.

This can add a new dynamic and insight for old fans. The English voice actors from the original series reprise their roles, and characters related to the original characters are introduced. There are also many references within the movies that hearken back to the original Macross saga; one such example is the Lynn Minmei songs found hummed and sung through out. While old fans of the series will be appreciative of this, I'm afraid that new people being introduced to the series will be left in the dark.

The other part of the movie serves as a continuation of the saga, introducing an all new (but not entirely new) race of mysterious alien antagonists. This sets up the plot line for future installments, so we can joyfully give away more of our money for Robotech related entertainment.

In essence, the story presented in `The Shadow Chronicles' re-introduces all of the classical elements within Robotech. The wars, the friendships, the tragedies, the budding loves, the old loves, and all of the conflicting drama that can unfold between it all. If you're familiar with the franchise, you will know what to expect. It shouldn't necessarily be viewed as a direct sequel, but more or less a re-introduction of the series...a revival of sorts.

The only criticisms that can be drawn is that the movie might rely too heavily on the past installments of the Robotech saga. Those completely new to the series, curious to see what all the buzz surrounding Robotech is about, will be left in the dark and mostly confused. There are also no real bold steps taken to try to revolutionize how we see the series. This can lead to be a double-edged sword of both good and bad: good, in the fact that it keeps in tact that essential strengths and qualities that old fans knew in the series; bad in the fact that we've already seen it all before. There weren't any bold directional steps taken or any attempted additions to the source made, like there was in, let's say, `Macross Plus' (which was an absolute masterpiece, in my opinion.).  This is why I rate it at 4 stars instead of 5.

Now, for question number 2.

The extra features and packaging of the material are all very nice and high quality -- what one would expect from the collectors edition of a well-known anime franchise. However, if one already had purchased the standard edition the extra features might not compel one to make it a MUST HAVE, but certainly a nice addition to your film collection.",1197158400,2,5627,4.924050632911392
2698222,4,B000KWZ1UM,"I really enjoyed this movie. I'm an anime fan, but not fanatic, so I'll spare you a 7 paragraph Robotech rant. I thought the plot was great and the story full with enough complexity to keep me interested. I liked it enough that I am going to find more Robotech to watch.

 I haven't seen any other Robotech episodes before this one and I was able to keep up with the story and not get lost. I didn't fully understand protoculture, but I don't think you need to, or should at this point. I could grasp the three waring parties and the hate between them. I was reminded of other classic Science Fiction stories including Star Trek which is a good thing. Characters had back stories which gave them depth.

I liked the blending of the cgi into the classic anime. The voice talents are great as well. Poor voice acting can really ruin a story. The DVDs and packaging are top notch. It is a quality release.",1196985600,2,902,4.357142857142857
2698223,2,B000KWZ1UM,"Growing up I used to love Robotech Scott Bernard/Invid cartoons.  So much so that I bought the original series on DVD once made available.  I'll admit I never really got into the original ""Macross Saga"" series with Rick Hunter & the Zentraedi.  I always thought it was waaaaaay to over the top, dramatic; much like most Anime which suffers from the same problem (don't hate me, that's just my own personal opinion.  Years later when Anime really made it's first big boom here in the states I saw the ""Macross Plus"" series updating the Robotech saga & further cementing my love for Robotech with it's amazing animation & epic story.  I saw that this was being released & I was all over it hoping for another ""MP"" but based on the ""Bernard"" characters.  What I got was nothing near what I'd hoped for:(.

This is basically a retelling/continuation of the final episode of the Robotech series.  I go into the plot as I don't want to spoil anything for anyone & not to mention you'll get plenty of plot from anyone of the other reviews.  My review is basically just a likes & dislikes ""POV"" for the DVD.  The voice acting was great, the story wasn't bad & the music is phenominal.  You get quite a package too with the 2nd disc full of all the extra, everything you'd want out of a 2 disc collectors edition.  My main & only gripe (& it's a big one) is the animation.

Maaaaa'an, I can't believe they'd allow something with the Robotech name attached to it get released with this amature & shotty work.  The traditional animation isn't bad, but everytime you see anything CGI it just completely takes you out of the moment.  I'm talking this CGI is ""Beast Wars"" bad.  It's some of the worst of the worst I've seen in a long time.  It seems like it's not finished, like they ran out of money & just slapped it in a DVD box & started selling it.  It's a real shame that this is supposedly celebrating 20 years of Robotech & this is the best they can come up with?  It's kind of an insult really.  The animation for me makes the movie kinda unbearable to watch, it's almost impossible to get into the movie.  It would be like watching Star Wars if all the space ships were replaced by paper airplanes on visible strings.  Maybe I'm being to harsh, maybe I just really had my hopes up way to high, but unfortunately there was just nothing here to enjoy:(.  I would suggest buying or renting the original Scott Bernard saga, or Macross Plus & just pretend this doesn't even exist.  Unfortunately I cannot recommend this DVD (& I really, REALLY wanted to :( ).  Had they taken their time & had the budget been right this could've been a masterpiece, instead we get a masterful piece of junk made & designed soley to cash in on the properties name.  Avoid this movie, I wish I had :(",1196899200,2,2772,4.3968565815324165
2698224,5,B000KWZ1UM,"Having never seen a Robotech film or show before, I went into Robotech - The Shadow Chronicles with no expectations.  I was amazed.  The movie was excellent.  It was easy to get swept into the story and the voice work was fantastic.  The animation along with the musical score provided the last couple of perfect elements to make the film an absolute success.  I'm not one for spoilers, so I won't go into the story, but if you are a fan of the science fiction, aliens, and human survival genre, this film is for you.

The bonus DVD is loaded with tons of great features that bring more life to the feature.  You could literally spend an entire day with this DVD.  It truly is a find and I recommend it anyone with the slightest interest in the anime, sci-fi, or robotech genres.  Well worth the purchase.",1196812800,2,805,4.421768707482993
2698225,4,B000KWZ1UM,"I have to say this was definitely worth watching. I remember I use to watching Robotech when I was a kid and I even had some Robotech toys. So when I got this movie I was hoping this movie wouldn't seem too kiddy or old school. Fortunately, it was neither. It had a good story line that held my attention and made me curious about the other episodes or movies that I had missed. Then I love the fact they used computer graphics for the robotech machines, which is what really modernized this classic cartoon.

So if you liked Robotech when you were a kid or is just a fan, you will enjoy this movie.",1196380800,2,599,4.208695652173913
2698226,3,B000KWZ1UM,"I was a fan of the original series 20 years ago, and watched most of the episodes when they aired, however I haven't thought about this show since the 80s and didn't know what to expect.  Fortunately, it contains a good bit of background material to catch viewers like myself up on what has happened previously.  The background material is likely sufficient for new viewers to understand what is going on in the series, but I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone who's never seen the show before, and you will probably be fairly confused still.

Unfortunately, the entertainment value of the film didn't appeal to me as much as the TV show did.  Possibly that's because my interests have changed over the years.  I'm not much of an anime fan anymore, and this also probably explains some of my lack of interest.  Another problem I had is the relatively poor animation when compared with some of the anime I've seen today.  It just doesn't hold up for something created a few years ago.  Sound and picture quality on the DVD are very good, and this collector's edition has a few additional features that fans should enjoy, but seem kind of thrown on there to make a ""collector's edition"" and the general viewer won't be interested in.  I watched several of the deleted scenes before realizing they were deleted for a reason and losing interest.

Other than the poor animation, this does seem to be a fairly high quality DVD, but I would advise any old fans of the TV series to consider renting before buying this collector's edition.",1196294400,,1533,4.66542750929368
2698227,3,B000KWZ1UM,"As an advance warning, this review contains a much higher percentage than usual (for me) of aging geekiness.  So be forewarned!

In fairness to ""Shadow Chronicles,"" expectations for this sequel were so high that it would be impossible to meet them regardless of the money spent or the specific people involved.  Fans had 20 years to dream up their own ideas of what would happen.  That goes even more for me.  Hardcore fans of the original series may be familiar with ""Birth of a New Generation,"" a bit of fan fiction that probably exceeds 100,000 words over 20+ episodes, written by me, Walter Jung and Matt Baril.  (I haven't talked to them for years; if you guys read this, I hope you are happy and doing well.)  That was back in the day when fan fiction meant pulling out the typewriter, and page layout meant I typed around Matt's art.

For me, a guy who spent years (over)thinking about this stuff, the core expectation of any sequel to ""Robotech"" was the search for Admiral Hunter and the SDF-3.  The end of ""Robotech"" set that up explicitly, and even the screenwriter mentioned in the ""making of"" featurette that he originally thought that would be the main idea of the series.  But the SDF-3 gets found literally 5 minutes after they start looking for it.  Ouch.  That really threw me for a loop.  And a related unanswered question from the old series, a question not even asked by ""Shadow Chronicles"": where is Lisa Hayes?

Again, in fairness to ""Shadow Chronicles,"" there is an enormous bolus of exposition that must be worked through.  It wasn't done elegantly, but at least was done in a workmanlike manner.  But a few very minor changes would have helped.  For example, we don't find out Skull Squadron leader - who is a fairly major character at the beginning - is Maia Sterling until 45 minutes in!  Maia would be Max & Miriya's daughter or granddaughter - either way, we'd have liked to have known that earlier.

Tonally, the first two acts are off, being too jokey and blase.  Indeed, ""Shadow Chroncicles"" starts off with characters we don't know acting weirdly lighthearted in a battle situation.  One of the overarching factors of the ""Robotech"" milieu is the increasing sense of desolation and isolation, that there are very few humans left, and that no family is untouched by death.  We get some of that at the end, making Marcus into more of an actual character than a goofball, but it would have been easy enough to bring that forward and make him more sympathetic 90 minutes sooner.  Another of the hallmarks of ""Robotech"" was the iconic moments and sheer sense of enormity - the Zentraedi holocaust, Khyron's suicide attack on the SDF-1, and the destruction of Toronto being but a handful of them.  Some of those moments are hinted at in ""Shadow Chronicles"" but not seen - for example, the epic and rushed evacuation of good ol' Space Station Liberty to the Ark Angel.  And some, like Scott Bernard & Vince Grant's business with the neutron-S missiles, are hurried and flat.

The animation is a strange mashup of traditional cels and CGI, which clash horribly, particularly in scenes involving the Forces of Shadow.

Having said all that, there is some good potential here.  ""Shadow Chronicles"" is full of good ideas that just need some fine tuning.  Ariel is handled particularly well; as she becomes more attuned to her Invid nature, she acquires the abilities of an Invid, without becoming some kind of magic all-powerful alien deus ex machina.  There are some bits of humor that are appropriate and actually funny.  The throwaway bits of Minmay's old songs that appear here and there are handled with a light touch, and are entertaining.

As an IP attorney, I cannot even begin to imagine how Harmony Gold assembled the pile of rights they needed to make this series.  Rights issues probably explain why the only ""Macross"" character we see, Rick Hunter, looks substantially different than in the past.  (Well, that and him being 40 years older.)  Indeed, missing characters probably have as much to do with rights issues as anything.  My hat is off to the legal team behind this project.

Ultimately, the Haydonites are a good idea.  A series that involves dozens of episodes of Scott Bernard out looking for Rick has a huge chance of being a tedious disaster.  The Haydonites are devious, as the Regess warns in the ""reimagined"" ending of the original series, and that is handled well.  How the Haydonites deal with the humans at Space Station Liberty is interesting and different from other shows we've seen before.  The Haydonites themselves are a mix of new-Galactica-Cylon, Darth Vader, and Hal 9000.  In the end, I find myself looking forward to a ""Shadow Chronicles"" series, despite the criticism above.  Most of the problems in this show have to do with its treatment of the past, not the future, and as it moves into the future I think it will do better.  (But don't forget to fill us in on the whereabouts of Lisa Hayes!)

The bonus materials are generous (appearing on a separate second disc) and interesting.  The promo for the abortive ""Robotech 3000"" is included, a strange project that appeared to have married ""Maximum Overdrive"" to ""Robotech.""  Several featurettes provide ample information about this production.  The ""making of"" featurette has fascinating interviews with the voice actors, including the truly-great Greg Snegoff (Scott Bernard).

If you liked the original show, you know you will at least rent this, for old times' sake if nothing else.  Also, if you like anime or SF, you should give this a shot as well.",1196035200,,5571,4.800420168067227
2698228,4,B000KWZ1UM,"I was first exposed to the Robotech universe over 20 years ago with the first anime series on US broadcast television. I had not kept up with the Robotech saga, and upon further research on Wikipedia, I learned that Shadow Chronicles is the first of the latest ""Shadow"" projects to be released. I was skeptical about Shadow Chronicles' entertainment value, but after watching the movie I felt it had enough momentum to pave the way for another Shadow sequel. As someone who isn't a diehard Robotech enthusiast, I felt Shadow Chronicles is an excellent great primer and does not feel dated. The CG graphics and animation is ""good enough"" to tell the story.

I recognized a theme similar to the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series where the enemy can manipulate the protagonists through the heroes' dependence on some special technology, and the key to success is to revert to ""old school"" methods like visual target acquisition, manual control of weapons, and using the Force.

I felt the movie was too short. Commander Sterlin's character is interesting because she mentioned she was half alien. Was she half Invid or something else? Why didn't Marcus and Alex react as negatively to her origin as they did when Ariel first revealed her true form? There are a lot of questions raised by Shadow Chronicles that I would like to have seen answered in the same movie, but this would defeat the purpose of a franchise or planned sequels.",1196035200,2,1436,4.881147540983607
2698249,4,B000KWZ1UM,"I was pleasantly surprised with regards to the direction of the storyline for this new saga in the Robotech Universe.  I have read the Jack Mckinney continuation series and did not quite agree with the direction he took most of the characters.  I like the further development in the characters of Scott Bernard and Ariel who were mostly eclipsed by Rook and Rand.  I really liked the INVID and this storyline shows a more diplomatic treatment to their race.
The new villains the ""Shadows"" sound very familiar, they feel like a hybrid of the Borg and the ""Shadows"" from Babylon 5, seeing as they are an ""ancient"" enemy that is very mechanically based taking their orders from one ""Source"" kinda like the Borg Queen.
Some surprises did come into this movie in the form of Maia Sterling; Is she the middle child? I thought the series had her named as Aurora, Rick Hunter now having white hair?  How did that happen?  The Grants, now being close to Earth, Marlene Rush's baby brother Marcus, who is the lamest character in this movie.  Marcus is the reason I gave it four stars, his interactions with Maia and the rest of the crew was the most awkward moments in the film.  If they are planning to continue the story arc in future projects, Marcus needs to be developed better.
I hope that this project can be continued and most of the fans expect to see improvement if Harmony Gold decides to fully develop it into a series.",1195948800,2,1421,4.570866141732283

The Shadow Chronicles is basically a retelling of the final cliffhanger episode of the original Robotech series from the point of view of the expeditionary force, rather than that of the resistance force led on Earth by Scott Bernard.  The story utilizes and expands on original plot elements like the Shadow Fighters and the Neutron-S missiles, but ignores many major characters like Rand, Rook, Lancer and Sera.  It also features a few characters from the failed Sentinels story, namely, Janice, Vince Grant and Jean Grant.

Protoculture addicts will hear many familiar voices in this production.  Tony Oliver reprises his role as Rick Hunter...whose hair has inexplicably turned white, even though he's only 54.  The voice of Roy Fokker, Dan Woren, portrays the foul-mouthed General Gunther Reinhardt.  Iona Morris, the voice of Claudia Grant, here portrays Claudia's sister-in-law, Dr. Jean Grant.  Richard Epcar returns as the voice of Vince Grant (he also voiced Ben Dixon and Lunk).  Alexandra Kenworthy reprises her role as the Invid Regess.  Edie Mirman, the voice of Miriya Sterling (and Nova Satori), now voices Miriya's bossy daughter, Maia Sterling.  Eddie Frierson, the voice of Lynn Kyle, portrays the perpetually green-goggled Dr. Louie Nichols.  Greg Snegoff returns as the voice of Scott Bernard (he also played Khyron in the Macross saga).  Kari Wahlgren, Robin Sena from Witch Hunter Robin, now provides the voice of Ariel (formerly known as Marlene, but not to be confused with Marcus Rush's deceased sister, also named Marlene).  Chase Masterson from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine voices the buxom android songstress, Janice.  And the legendary Mark Hamill has a small role as the scar-faced Commander Daryl Taylor.

Instead of providing a conclusion to the epic saga that took the country by storm in 1985, Shadow Chronicles continues the story by launching a brand new chapter with new heroes and a mysterious new enemy even more dangerous than the hated Invid.  Thus, Chronicles ends as the TV series did, with yet another cliffhanger.  Harmony Gold has assured the fans that further adventures are forthcoming, and promised that this chapter will not go the way of the Sentinels.  If that's true, one wonders why they are double dipping on part 1 instead of moving on to part 2.

If you don't already have the single-disc release of Shadow Chronicles, you're in luck.  This fully-loaded two-disc Collector's Edition is the one to own.  If, like most rabid Robotech fanatics, you bought the first DVD as soon as it hit the shelves, you now have the unenviable task of trying to decide whether or not to purchase this new set.  Since the movie is exactly the same, and you're only going to watch the special features once anyway, it's probably not worth a second purchase...unless you want to collect all things Robotech.  If so, here's the lowdown on the new edition.  The discs come in one of those overlapping cases that require one DVD to rest on top of the other.  The keep case is wrapped in a clear plastic sleeve that compliments the attractive cover art.  When you open said case, you'll see full-color production sketches of several of the characters under the DVDs.  These character designs actually look better than the ones that made it into the film.  Disc 1 has the movie along with an informative commentary by director Tommy Yune, screenwriter Ford Riley and composer Scott Glasgow.  Here you'll learn all about how the movie was made despite a frantic production schedule and a very tight budget.  You might even feel compelled to purchase the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Soundtrack/dp/B000MRA4BQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Soundtrack</a>&nbsp;CD.  Disc 2 is crammed with extras, such as: The Making of the Shadow Chronicles Featurette (also on the single disc edition), which includes interviews with several Robotech voice actors; an Anime Selects Featurette filmed at RoboCon 20; the Original Score Video, showcasing Scott Glasgow's orchestral music; a bit of Robotech 3000 footage starring some odd looking CGI characters; eight Deleted Scenes with optional commentary; a couple of Commercial Bumpers; a Podcast interview with Tommy Yune; six Split Screen Animatics with commentary; Teaser Trailers and DVD Trailers; a Personnel Dossier with images and info on all the main characters; a Ship Registry and Mecha Database with diagrams and details on all the mecha and spaceships; and finally, some cover images from the Prelude to the Shadow Chronicles comic books.

Shadow Chronicles might please fans of the original TV series, but it may not appeal to newcomers who have no previous Robotech knowledge.  The visuals in this film pale in comparison to much of the anime available today (i.e.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Karas/dp/B000EDWLXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Karas</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Appleseed/dp/B0007OY31G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Appleseed</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metropolis/dp/B00005V4XG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metropolis</a>).  The CGI looks primitive, with boxy spaceships and large flat interior surfaces without much texture.  The subdued color palate consists primarily of dark gray, light gray, pastel pink and purple against the pitch blackness of space.  All of the explosions are the same shade of orange, and most of the characters have color-coordinated eyes and hair.  Maia has lavender hair, purple eyes and lavender trim on her flight suit; Janice has pink eyes and wears red flowers in her pink hair and a red jewel at the base of her neck; Scott has blue hair and blue eyes and wears a blue trimmed flight suit.  Only the scenes that take place on Earth and, of course, the cell-shaded Cyclones look truly spectacular.  Despite its aesthetic shortcomings, The Shadow Chronicles lays the foundation for a compelling new adventure in the Robotech universe.  Hopefully, the profits from the two DVD releases can be used to fund a vastly improved sequel.  Who knows, maybe we'll even get to see Lisa and Minmei again...I just hope their hair hasn't gone prematurely white too!",1195516800,3,6332,5.539501039501039

2698253,4,B000KWZ1UM,"We all know that some of the animation in Shadow Chronicles is computer-generated; my question is, so what? I had no trouble telling that an Alpha fighter was an Alpha, or that an Invid scout was a scout. The dedication to reproducing the original mecha in updated style was obvious. To me, these updates didn't diminish the Robotech legacy, they just brought it into the twenty-first century.

Will people complain? Of course--a great many supposed fans of Robotech still complain that Carl Macek made the series at all, preferring the ""original"" Japanese storylines of the show's three unrelated components. These purists will certainly have no love for Shadow Chronicles, nor should we expect them to. I thought that the new mecha animations looked great, and I appreciated that the characters and other scenery were traditionally animated. Surprisingly, these didn't seem out of sync.

The storyline in Shadow Chronicles is setting the stage for something, a precursor to an expanded Robotech tale that goes beyond what was seen in the original trilogy. It also goes beyond and in some cases against what Robotech fans may know from the Jack McKinney novels; this is not surprising, because McKinney's novels themselves were out of sync with the show in several important ways. It is a bit tricky, though, because in the case of the Sentinels saga (i.e. what the REF and Admiral Hunter were up to halfway across the galaxy while Earth was fighting the Second Robotech War), there IS no show to fall back on for most of it. Whatever we as fans know of the storyline comes from the novels.

Is that a problem? It doesn't have to be. Shadow Chronicles is, as I mentioned, clearly a pilot for a new Robotech storyline. Provided that new storyline helps us learn the key points of what happened ""off stage"" regarding the Haydonites, etc., we could seamlessly be brought up to speed on the Sentinels storyline as it was assumed when making this film (rather than the storyline from the books). Among these key points: how the Haydonites rose to such power so quickly after the fall of Invid Regent; why their world was spared outright destruction by the Regent if the Invid knew that they were responsible for the destruction of Optera; the relationship between the Haydonites and the Robotech Masters, who seem to have been Haydonite agents of sorts but clearly were Protoculture users; and how Louis Nichols came to be part of the REF by the time of the attack on Reflex Point (which was not the case in the books).

These are areas of opportunity, though, where Harmony Gold can expand and enhance the Robotech storyline. They're not ""flaws"" in the storyline. Robotech: Shadow Chronicles fits nicely with the conclusion of the original series and lays the foundations for a new Robotech saga. If Shadow Chronicles is a bit light on personal development, I'd suggest that you rewatch the first 2-3 episodes of each of the original Robotech series; it takes time for characters to become real.",1190160000,,2992,4.883858267716535
2698254,4,B000KWZ1UM,"Great movie and continues the saga however, I wasn't a fan of how the Invid invasion is dealt with in the plot. Hope they put out another sequel soon as they still need put some focus back on the orginal characters and what happened /happens to them. CGI is a little ordinary but overall pretty good visually.",1190160000,,309,4.43859649122807
2698255,3,B000KWZ1UM,"I liked how they redone the end of the 3rd Robotech War, it clarified a very confusing and unsatisfying conclusion to a much better story.  That's the most positive thing I have to say about The Shadow Chronicles.

I realize that they had to present a new enticing story to hook people back into the series, but frankly there was surface level character development.  The story rushes forward to establish the basic conflict that is going to serve as the basis of the rest of the story.  Ok, back when I was 14 and ""Top Gun"" was all the rage and I had never seen Anime before, the Mecha and battles could hold my interest by themselves.  But no longer.  The beautiful thing about the original series, especially Macross was the timing.  They TOOK THEIR TIME developing the characters while keeping you entertained with the battles.  Well now it's pretty obvious in the new movie how the relationships are going to develop, everyone was practically paired off at the end of the movie!

What's disappointing is the potential for the character development that they squandered by rushing forward with all of the character development.
  All of a sudden, Marlene/Ariel has gone from a timid pawn to an assertive, self confident, powerful teleporting super being/invid.  It would had been nice to see some of her personal growth regarding this transformation and whether or not she has any lingering regrets about not joining the invid.  Perhaps some emotional vulnerabilities?  I would hate to see her developed into some super powerful pet that they use to help them when they need it and ignore her otherwise.  And if they did, then she should get angry and desert them.
  Also, it would had been a perfect opportunity for them to rebuild the Scott-Ariel relationship, which was based on different dynamics than the Scott-Marlene relationship, which Scott destroyed when he abandoned Marlene/Ariel to search for Admiral Hunter.  I mean c'mon, he turned his back on her when she had given up everything to be with him.  If she is this mature new person, then Scott has some explaning to do, rather than her just following him around declaring her undying love for him.

  And what is the deal with always bringing around the the relatives of previous characters.  What good does Marcus do being Marlene's brother?
They didn't do anything with that in the movie and now everyone is happy with one another and no conflict left among friends. Marcus could had been a brand new character as a potential love interest for Maia.  And certainly don't have those two practically in love by the end of the first movie, it's too canned, ready for easy mass consumption--give me a break! Bring in new characters, not just recycle old character's relatives!
  And if you do bring in a familar family name, then do something with it that could had not been done with someone else.  Since they brought in Maia Sterling, do something with her family history, not just make her a hotshot pilot who is easy marks for a goof ball named Marcus.
  And this thing between Louie and Janice; too predictable.  And besides why is ""Dr Nichols"" manning the helm like a Star Trek ensign?  I would think that he would be the new Dr Lang who appears briefly to inform the captain of what's going on with the fancy protoculture machinery and then disappears into the background.  Louie's days of danger are behind him back in the 2nd Robotech war.  I like him, but Louie should be retired as a major character.

I didn't mind the new villians, but they aren't very impressive yet.  The story line that they are setting up isn't bad, but the magic of Robotech wasn't in the story as much as it was in the characters.  I think they have forgotten that, or never really understood what they had to begin with.",1187827200,,3773,4.706870229007634
2698256,3,B000KWZ1UM,"This audacious attempt to revive the celebrated Robotech franchise is, in many ways, something of a disappointment.  For starters, no Minmei.  In fact, the only original Robotech characters in this movie are Louis Nichols, Scott Bernard, Ariel and the Regess.  A character claiming to be the legendary Rick Hunter makes an extremely brief cameo, but the guy looks to be about 80 so I doubt he's the real deal.  If anyone wants to make the case that traditional 2D animation and 3D CGI don't work well together, the Shadow Chronicles should be Exhibit A.  Boxy, colorless PlayStation 2-style spaceships zip around in a sea of blackness, lit only by an array of unimpressive orange explosions.  Drab Alpha Fighter models are piloted by top-heavy figures in charcoal gray flight suits, with oddly animated mouths full of tiny, individually-drawn teeth.  The only things that actually look good are the cell-shaded Cyclones and Scott's matching mint-green armor.  And where are Ulpio Minucci and Alon Ober when we need them?  Aside from a few bars of the beloved Robotech opening theme at the start of the film, the catchy background music from the classic cartoon has been entirely replaced with a standard sci-fi orchestral score.  Despite these flaws, The Shadow Chronicles manages to capture just enough of the old Robotech magic to keep it from being a total disaster.  Scott and Ariel are featured prominently (although Ariel has a different voice and some crazy new teleportation powers), and new characters like Marcus Rush (Marlene's brother) and Maia Sterling (Dana's sister) show genuine potential.  It's interesting to note that Marcus and Marlene look almost identical aside from hair color (his is orange, hers is lavender)--Coincidence?  Janice the android could become the next Robotech pop star if the filmmakers would give her a chance to sing more than just the first line of `It's You.'  As the story closes with a cliffhanger, it's apparent that Harmony Gold did not intend to provide a satisfactory conclusion to the epic Robotech saga, but instead to lay the foundation for a brand new series.  Mysterious villains known to the Invid as ""the Children of the Shadow"" are introduced here, and the battle for Protoculture rages on.  If the animation is improved, I think future Shadow Chronicles episodes could succeed in reigniting the flames of Robotechnology for old and new fans alike.  Alas, I fear this will go the way of `The Sentinels,' and we'll never hear from the freakishly-proportioned, pink-haired robot girl (or the scar-faced, white-haired Admiral) again.  Will we win?  We will see.",1186617600,,2615,5.110588235294117
2698257,2,B000KWZ1UM,"This movie is a complete disappointment, in fact it doesn't even seem to even try to build off the success of the previous Robotech story.  From a sequel you would expect the tying in of all the previous story-lines, but if anything this movie seems to only serve to contradict it instead.  Instead of answers on what happened after the SDF-3 left earth, we get main characters who don't seem to realize each others existence.  I mean how does nobody know who Maia Sterling is? Her last name should be well known for her  father's Rep, if not her sisters Dana and yet even Louie Nichols doesn't seem to realize who she is.

As for the SDF-3, I could accept that it isn't in this movie really if we could at least pretend this was Lisa's ship.  Instead everyone wants to talk to Rick, even though Lisa is a freaking fleet admiral and out ranks him.  Indeed, I don't even think she's mentioned in this movie once, though I may be mistaken.  I mean geeze, is it too much to ask to bring a little closure to the past while pushing forward with the future?  This piece of crap doesn't even attempt to do so, and its a mockery of all that was great about Robotech.

As for Harmony Gold expressing that the The Sentinels from Jack McKinney's novel's aren't canon, great I can accept that, just make sure to give me something on what actually did happen instead.  I mean at least the Sentinels had a reason for sucking as a movie, it was never completed, this movie sucks due to laziness.  So until they get their act together and give the fans what they want, I'm just going to have to accept the Jack McKinney ending to robotech since they're giving us nothing better.

The effort of the Harmony Gold team was enormous and the music and the graphics are simply superb. But unfortunately, the history is not as good as I was expecting. I am a fan, and I have seen the movie more than four times, but the history has some inconsistencies with the original saga and (as I have ever thought) the famous ""second generation"" is still a problem for the producers.",1185667200,,577,4.504761904761905
2698279,2,B000KWZ1UM,"I am a RABID ROBOTECH lover, having spent more than two decades as a member of the fandom.  My criticsim of this series is harsh, but justified.  I finally saw RT:ShC...  To say I am disappointed would be a dramatic understatement.

It had some very good moments but these were interspersed with some of the most pedestrian scenes I have ever had to live through.  Unlike my view of the latest entries in the ""STAR WARS"" saga, I know it is not my age that is the cause of my poor reaction.  I still love the original ROBOTECH series as much as I ever did.  But this script was just flat out lame.  The cliche's were enough to make me gag and I don't know why they even bothered to draw clothes on the female characters.  Their breasts looked like water balloons on the verge of bursting--clearly enhancement is standard in the ShC timeline.

*sigh*

As for the ""new"" enemy (as if we needed any more)...I was *NOT* impressed by them.  The Invid in ""ROBOTECH: The New Generation"" were far more ominous and sinister.  The new enemy is a charicature of itself.

I will say I am a fan of Maiya Sterling's.  Except for her final screaming scene and perhaps the scene were she slams her fist against the arm rest completely devoid of any human passion, she is a very likeable and endearing character.  This movie is not without its positives, either, as there were some very humorous exchanges among some of the characters.  But I am really bummed, ESPECIALLY when one looks at ""Macross Zero"" as a comparison.

Four out of ten for me.  The original beat this thing to death.  So did widely panned ""ROBOTECH: The Sentinels.""

The CG is awful as well. The spaceships look like they were textured with brick textures, and the lighting and effects are very poor and amateurish.

I certainly hope Harmony Gold just allows Robotech to live on in it's original form -- the form most of us in our 30's remember it as. In trying to gain new, younger fans, Harmony Gold continues to ruin a classic series.",1183852800,5,818,4.920289855072464
2698281,4,B000KWZ1UM,"In 1985, a new series debuted in the United States.  Robotech. It was the first of its kind: an animated serial science fiction epic that asked the question: What will we do when we discover we are not alone in the universe?

Beginning with the crash landing of an abandoned alien ship on Earth in the year 1999, and ending with the liberation of Earth from the alien race of the Invid in 2044, the original Robotech series charts in dramatic narrative the lives, losses, and sometimes, deaths of the characters over the course of three terrible wars between human beings and aliens.  Many story issues were deliberately left unresolved.

Those questions have remained unanswered for a generation - until now.

The Third Robotech War is over.

Even though Humanity has secured an empty victory over the Invid, there is no time for rest. Scott Bernard and Ariel discover they have been played for fools all along. Former allies of the human race have been orchestrating events from behind the scenes, hoping for a war of mutual extermination. Realizing that the Invid have fled Earth, and ended the conflict before it could reach its desired outcome, they emerge from the shadows bent on finishing the job themselves.

Their goal: the complete extermination of both Humanity and Invid.

In the tradition of the original, the movie is dark, gritty, and deadly serious, dealing with many themes of the human condition while telling a fast paced story.  It's pacing and depth are its greatest strength and its greatest weakness.  The film is too fast paced to catch everything in the first viewing, and its plot is a result of subsequent (and necessary) dependence on knowledge of events in the original series.  If you are a fan of the original, this is definitely recommended, but if you are entirely new to the Robotech story, I'd suggest watching the original series first.",1182470400,4,1873,4.8584905660377355
2698282,3,B000KWZ1UM,"I have been a Robotech fan since the original series, and I was cautious about getting too excited about this DVD.  I saw what happened to the Star Wars series and was prepared for the worst.  The good thing was that Shadow Chronicles is not the worst.  Nor is it the best.  I think that the idea is well intentioned, but they just don't have the time to develop the story, the way that they did in the original series.  Its hard when you only have 2 hours or less, to tell such a grand story.  And, that is what made ROBOTECH great.  The story, though grand in scope, was about the people that were taking part in these wars.  Any form of storytelling that does not have the time to tell this kind of story is severly at a disadvantage, and so it is for the SHadow Chronicles.  ROBOTECH is too fantastical, and the story too well developed for a DVD to come along and explain everything that is happening and make us feel for the characters, and tell a meaningful story.  This is the weakness of the SHadow Chronicles.  It means well, but it really doesn't get anywhere.  Viewers of the original series will get a kick out of seeing old characters again, and I enjoyed that aspect.  But, these experienced viewers will also get tired of the retelling of the story.  New viewers will undoubtedly be asking, ""what?"", because the story of Robotech is kinda out there, if you don't watch the original series.  Oh, and the computer graphics, once again, fail to impress.  I hate computer graphics in movies and anime.  Especially when I used to love to watch the art of the Mecha.  Now they are laughable video game creatures.  Very disapointing, but I understand that the cost would be too great to animate the battle scenes.  The art overall is not great, but is decent, and really is eqaul to the original series in quality (some of the episodes in Macross were pretty raw).

Robotech promises to be a living work now, and this movie will set the groundwork for more animation in Robotech.  I liked the subtle character relations, and the humor, and the mecha, though the computer graphics leave a little more artistic character to be desired.  I however was disappointed in the slight but obvious differences in the character designs from the original, such as very similar body types that seemed slightly cookie-cutter and not as I remember, but that's putting a fan's expectations above the reality that they had to hire different animators after the 20+ year gap between this project and the 1985 TV series.

It's impossible to empathize with the main characters. The animation has the same lack of emotion as the voice acting. There's nothing significant with any of the characters and the only memorable quality with anyone is Janice's eyes.

Computer Graphics. The CG animation used must have been left over technology from The Last Starfighter. There have been computer games in the past few years that blow this movie away and on top of that there was no attempt to blend the CG with the cel animation. Hey animators, when a ship explodes don't immediately remove the ship's model and replace it with an explosion smaller than the ship.

The animation is way better than anything in the original series or the short lived sequel, ""The Sentinels"".  Although I do not recall seeing any Royal Command Battloids (Invid) in the battle sequences, I could be wrong, I'll definitely watch it again to find out.

Kudos for getting so many of the original cast members back for the Shadow Chronicles, as well as some top shelf new talent.

Hopefully there will be more to follow as the movie opens up plenty of plotlines to follow up.

I am giving this four stars only because I would have prefered a series (maybe another 83 episodes hint hint)instead of a one shot movie.",1176163200,,997,4.593220338983051

After all, good reviews generate buzz, which generates sales, which in turn, generates more new Robotech product.

However, if the Robotech product is not up to snuff, then what we end up with is more sub-quality, albeit new sub-quality Robotech product.

Well, this film has flaws. Compared to the 1980's, the production values are quite a leap forward. However, by 21st century standards, they  not up to snuff. The CG Veritechs do not have a feeling of weight--the wings do not bend and flex like normal wings.  They seemed paradoxically boxy and weightless. Or massless.

(The Bergenholm inertialess drive is from another franchise&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Triplanetary-A-Tale-of-Cosmic-Adventure-Lensman-Series-Book-1/dp/1882968093/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Triplanetary: A Tale of Cosmic Adventure (Lensman Series, Book 1)</a>)

As to the drawing, they are a mixed bag.  There is a subtle, yet obvious jump in how the cast is depicted--now in accordance with current anime conventions.  The females were quite  a sight--all having their eyes and hair color-coordinated, all being almost identical.  And their mammaciousness seems more suited for aversion therapy.

For the few seconds we see Admiral Hunter (no relation), he seems stiff, a talking celluloid head, but no expression, which means no soul.  And Louie doesn't seemed to have aged much.

I thought the swearing was forced.  It was out-of-continuity with the original series.  And in the attempt to make the series more adult, it came off being childish.  ""When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child"" but ""when I became a man, I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.""

The dialogue is gooey, and they could have used a script doctor.

The characterization was equally soulless. The new characters--and I love the idea of having Marlene's brother meet Ariel--are mere cookie-cutter figurines, not even rising to the level of platonic forms&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Collected-Dialogues-of-Plato-Including-the-Letters-Bollingen-Series-LXXI/dp/0691097186/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Collected Dialogues of Plato: Including the Letters (Bollingen Series LXXI)</a>.

There is a deeper point to this. Maia is too perfect. She is a perfect 10 body and soul, and she comes across as a confident, ""voice that is dark like tinted glass"" sexpot.  And do I need to mention the lavender eyes, a red flag for fan-fictiondoms's Mary Sue?  She is really to hard to work with simply because she is too perfect.

In Macross,  Rick was caught between Minmei (all body, no brains) and Lisa (all brains, no body), with Hunter (no relation) finally choosing the better person.  Despite that both Minmei and Lisa had their flaws, which made them more believable.  And more relatable.

Chesterton said ""In a thrilling novel (that purely Christian product) the hero is not eaten by cannibals; but it is essential to the existence of the thrill that he *might* be eaten by cannibals.""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Orthodoxy/dp/0486437019/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Orthodoxy</a>&nbsp;In the same vein, Maia is not eatable, or approachable, because she is this hyper-stylized ubermensch.  There is no thrill. Therefore, the only way out is to give her a very serious hidden flaw--to burst the bubble of her bravado. That, or give her a nervous breakdown.

Storywise, they made the same mistake that Bakshi did with the 1978 animated ""Lord of the Rings"" film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/J-R-R-Tolkien-Animated-Films-Set-The-Hobbit-The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Return-of-the-King/dp/B00005UM49/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">J.R.R. Tolkien Animated Films Set (The Hobbit/The Lord of the Rings/The Return of the King)</a>. It was GNDN--goes nowhere, does nothing.  We wade through all the plot twists, characterization (meeting the new, reacquainting with the old), and enjoying the whole process. But at the end of film, are no further along that we are when we started. The hyperspace leaps to and from SDF-3 really do not push the plot along. As it stands, the film was an extended episode, and not an epic.

However, being a half-retcon and a half-parallel retelling of episodes 84 and 85, it is salvageable. The ending does lend itself for either a series, miniseries, or a film.  In 2  hours, you can catch us up with the REF and what exactly did happen to that rag-tag group.

What we want to see is the fully grown and aged Admiral Hunter, Admiral Lisa (minus the weird half-filp from Robotech II), and more of the others. This should be the series Ragnark, so have a coming together of all the cast.  Since there is a fantasy element, the ghosts of Ben Dixon and Roy Fokker would not be inappropriate.

I would caution about starting a now series, like the aborted Robotech II.  The original franchise was so successful in getting it's message across about war, peace, love, hate, romance, and the human condition in a universe that is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish.  Give us a romping good tale, tie up all loose ends with a golden bow, and kiss the franchise good night. Do not drag it on like Start Trek--I dread a Robotech: Voyager, or Robotech: Enterpise.  Recycled and rehashed.

2698318,3,B000KWZ1UM,"As a somewhat seasoned Robotech fan, I found this movie to be exceedingly disappointing.  After purchasing the Robotech Protoculture Collection, and finally finishing Southern Cross and The New Generation (I was introduced to Robotech in the 1990s as a child on Cartoon Network's Toonami.  They never finished showing Southern Cross and never ran the New Generation), I was hoping this movie would eliminate the negative impression the New Generation left me with.  Instead, I'm still continuing to lose favor with this series.  The movie was essentially episode 84 and 85 somewhat rewritten and condensed with some added elements.  Rather than sitting on the edge of your seat, you'll probably be popping NoDoze to stay awake, or turn off the movie and resume watching it at another time.  The plot was vapid, and the new threat (""Haydonites"", I believe) were about as menacing as an old floppy disk.  The CGI was far too boxy (not to mention out of place), and the film feels rushed--reminds me of those insipid ""fanfictions"" people enjoy writing.  Suffice to say, this animation left much to be desired.  At the movie's end, I found myself saying, ""Wait, what?  The movie's OVER? That's it?""
Perhaps there is still hope for the Robotech legacy to hold onto its prestige with a new series, but I'm not holding my breath.  On a positive note, this movie could be considered stepping stone to larger projects.",1175299200,4,1409,4.953191489361702
2698319,3,B000KWZ1UM,"While I am a fan of Robotech, I was expecting this movie to be a lot better than it was. Visually it was good. But the story was very slow and the Shadow enemy wasn't defined enough so that you can understand why they were going after the Invid and any other culture that used protoculture. Also when it ended I felt it wasn't finished, I am guessing that there will be another movie down the line, but the way it ended that wasn't clear.",1175299200,3,438,4.1647058823529415
2698320,1,B000KWZ1UM,"Let me jump right into my criticisms.  The veritechs are too stiff.  Their appendages should show more movement that conveys the forces they are straining under and overcoming.  They should flex under the stresses and strains of thrusters and afterburners, rather than just being floating static images.  They should bow and bend as if the protoculture is almost too powerful and the veritechs arms and legs are almost overcome by their own jet engines.  Also, when the veritechs spin around in space to face one another in the Shadow Chronicles there is this horrible sound effect that sounds like a whine or a zip and it sounds too cartoonish.

Enemies are more interesting when they have individual personalities and inner turmoil.  The Zentreadi had Breetai, Exedore, Azonia, Khyron, Miriya, and Dolza.  You could instantly recognize them.  They were individuals with competing agendas and politics.  The Masters were more of a collective but at least they had threesomes or triumvirates of elders and scientists.  The Invid were a hive but even they have the Regis, Regent, princes, princesses, and scientists.  Also, the Regis and Regent were estranged and that spurred the viewers curiosity, at least in the Sentinels pilot.  Even the good guys, the REF, had tension and politics amongst their own commanders like Captain Gloval and the United Earth Government or Dana and Ralph Emerson and Edwards, etc. etc.  In the Shadow Chronicles there is not even a hint of politics or tension amongst the ranks.  They should have at least planted a seed.  We're all adults and we can handle a little more complexity in the plot.  The Haydonites seem boring and too Borg-ish.

The explosions in outer space  sucked.  Go back to the crescent moon bubble explosions of the Macross Saga.  These explosions in the Shadow Chronicles look like fuzzy orange CGI cut and paste junk.  They look like a bunch of tiny explosions that were copied or cloned or multiplied to produce larger explosions.  When the SDF's main gun hit a Zentreadi ship it would bubble and swell and burst.  Also, when the SDF's main gun would fire up you could feel the building energy and the orgasmic release and climax of the firing.  It had a weight and a force to it.  It would slam into a Zentreadi battle cruiser.  The lasers in the Shadow Chronicles are more like the sanitary versions found in Star Trek.

The REF uniforms are totally unrealistic.  You can see all the character's belly buttons through their uniforms because they're so tight.  Louie Nichols has a chain around his collar holding a cloak or cape on.  It's too much bling bling and too distracting.  These could be uniforms for ceremonial purposes but not active duty during the liberation of Planet Earth.  The uniforms should be much simpler.

The leaders all have huge pectorals and massively broad shoulders.  There should be more anatomical variety.  The female's [...] have already been discussed in other reviews.  The characters teeth all look weird as well.

The animation is more Saturday Morning cartoon style than Anime style.  Often the character and scene appear stiff and only their head is moving and seems to be floating and not attached to the scene.  It reminded me of the art quality and standards in the Comico Comics.  Sometimes, you couldn't even recognize the characters because they were drawn so badly.

Do some Matrix style re-invention of dogfights.  Use unique and innovative camera angles and perspectives and points of view of missiles and stuff.  Like in the very first episode when Rick and Minmei are in that trainer Veritech and in free fall and and he opens the cockpit and pulls her back inside.

Rick Hunter doesn't look realistic.  There should have been some Zentreadi soldiers or units or Sentinel units.  Some tension between Zentreadi and humans would be nice as well.  Maybe some humans and Zentreadi dating also, rather than just Mya the half breed.

There's no getting around we want to see Max, Miriya, and Dana Sterling.  We want to see Emil Lang, Lisa Hayes, Breetai, and Exedore.  If they can't get approval to use the characters names and likenesses then please don't continue my torture and heartache.  I don't want a series with the creators hands tied behind their backs.  We want to see Tirol and some home worlds.  We want to see the Regent.  I know Macek had to do flashbacks and narration and monologues to merge three stories and to establish story lines for Western Audiences, but I liked those flashbacks and narration and monologues and I missed them in Shadow Chronicles.  Bring back the omnipotent narrator.  That guys voice was awesome.  Having the narrator back would be like the thread that ties all the series together and provides some continuity.  I enjoyed Captain Gloval and Rick's inner thoughts and monologues.  Bring that back.  Do some flashbacks.  Clips from the old series should merge seamlessly into Shadow Chronicles.  Keep the animation style the same.

There should have been more scenes from individual Invid mecha perspectives.  It was all just clam shell ships opening and scarab beetle sound effects.  We need the perspective through the red tinged Invid eye piece.  Granted they can't pick up on the protoculture readings due to the shadow technology but even a few camera angles from the Invid perspective of a dog fight would have been nice.

The opening credits sucked.  It looked very amateur.  The speed was too quick and then too slow.  It was very bland.

We all love Robotech.  There is a ton of potential here.  Start over with new character designs, ditch the CGI or drastically improve upon them.  I want to give this new series a chance.  They deserve a shot.  Please radically overhaul the whole project.  In the DVD extras the creators say they love Robotech.  They should resign if they have so much respect for Robotech but I guess they need a job and something to fill up their resumes.",1174348800,15,5929,4.874497991967871
2698321,4,B000KWZ1UM,"My husband recently ""forced"" me to sit through the Robotech Protoculture collection (all three TV series).  I ended up loving it, so I was anxious to see how the story continued in The Shadow Chronicles.

First, I have to say I was a little disappointed with two aspects of the movie.  The first being that the first half-hour or so was basically a rehash of the last couple episodes of the New Generation series, albeit a bit chopped up as part of it was told from the side of a pilot from the returning fleet.  So it felt a little off in that respect.

The second part is that there was no real resolution; of course, as always, it was left open for more.

I believe that one of the reviews said that Admiral Rick Hunter did not make an appearance due to licensing issues; however, Adm. Hunter was in the movie, although his appearance was brief and limited to a viewscreen contact or two.

In general, I do recommend this if you're a fan; if you're not, you're going to be lost.  Just be prepared as you won't get all the answers you're hoping for.",1174262400,2,1051,4.326530612244898

2698343,4,B000KWZ1UM,"For those of us who have followed Robotech loyally from our childhoods, this is a gift from above. The old shows still loom large as landmarks of animation and storytelling--but having looked at the original shows with a more experienced eye as an adult I am often disappointed and a bit embarrassed by the jerky animation and fight scenes that look like the editor looped the same few scenes of jet fighters flying by and alien spaceships exploding.

By contrast this film is amazing--with character designs and scenery that made big misty tears form in the corners of my eyes. The story is fresh from the Sentinels (a fact that may be a problem for those that haven't been keeping up with the series beyond the original three TV shows) and takes off immediately from the attack on Reflex point. A bunch of the main characters are there, voiced by all the original actors, taken from across all previous series. It's wonderful.

On the other hand there are serious shortcomings with the movie. The dialogue is corny--quite often painfully corny. The mecha are all CG, so the Invid look pretty awful, and the Alpha fighters look really stiff and video-gamey. If only the same team that animated the characters could have done the vehicles...*sigh*

Still all things concidered, this is a must buy. It's the first new Robotech animation to come out since the Sentinels--and it's AMAZING how far these guys have taken their craft since then!",1174176000,,1439,4.817813765182186
2698344,1,B000KWZ1UM,"I had low expectations for this but even they were blown out of the water. The story was miserably bad, and the terrible script only served to highlight its deficiencies. The computer animation looked like a few untalented students threw it together for their semester end project... it had absolutely no character, detail, or dynamism. The character design was just as bad. All of the characters costumes looked straight out of some bad fantasy with capes and jeweled chokers... completely inappropriate for the story. They had to throw in as many related characters to the back-story as possible which only added to the forced feeling of the whole affair (oh hey, it's so and so's second nephew who is now in command of the ship and is best friends with you know who's daughter). Just for kicks, I watched the ""making of"" feature afterwards and almost died when I heard the producers gush over how many stories they went through before they came up with the perfect one. That's hard to believe, because it honestly can't get much worse than this. I watched Robotech when it was first on American television back in the early 80's and I've seen it with mature eyes since then and have released its hold of nostalgia. It was a great show for the time and, The Macross saga at least, still holds up well (save for the horrible dives in animation quality in certain episodes). However, there is no excuse for putting out junk like this with the maturity of the industry and sophistication of the audience as it stands today. It's too bad Tatsunoko productions, or whoever did the original didn't take the reigns on this money grabbing stinker. The most recent Japanese production, Macross Zero, was lots better.

UPDATE June 6, 2008: The Japanese have recently done Macross Frontier which blows this out of the water so badly, it's embarrassing.",1173744000,6,1843,4.79559748427673

The Good - it's Robotech, damnit!  We've all been waiting a long time for this. It was fun and nostalgic to watch.  The animation of interior scenes and people was quite good - it was a little slick, lacking some of the texture of the hand-drawn original, but it still looked good.

The Bad - the exterior scenes looked, at best, like the CGI of season 1 or 2 of Babylon 5.  Way too clean and rigid, lacking a certain smoothness.  Moreover, the plot was also eerily like that of Babylon 5 (the mysterious and manipulative ""Shadows"") - after a while I was wondering whether I was simply watching a cartoon B5.

The Ugly - well, not really, but the female characters were frankly out of control in the chest area.  This is Robotech, not hentai, and it looked silly - I mean, since when was every major female character a DD?  In the original series most of the strong female characters had a trim, graceful look - not so here.

2698346,1,B000KWZ1UM,"I was profoundly disappointed by the new Robotech movie.  I eagerly anticipated this release for more than 2 years, and when it finally came out, it was an enormous letdown.  The problems with this production begin with the story.  The first act is nothing but a rehash of the last two episodes, and certain events have been rewritten.  There are only five characters from the original saga present, including Rick Hunter, Louie Nichols, Scott Bernard, Ariel, and the Regis. And let's face it, Louie Nichols and the Regis frankly aren't very interesting. Marlene appears as a hologram, Claudia Grant is referred to briefly, and the Sterlings are obliquely referred to.  Part of what I wanted to see in a sequel to Robotech was what happened to all the characters I loved, especially people like Rick, Lisa, Max, Miriya, Rand, and Rook.  I'm not interested in generic characters like Marcus Rush, Vince Grant, General Reinhardt, or Maia Sterling (Where's Dana?  Where's Aurora?).  And when Rick Hunter does appear, he looks nothing like the guy I remembered from Macross.  He looks really old, and he has a big scar on his face.  I don't think he spent that much time fighting the invid in the SDF-3, and I don't buy the theory that fighting the invid made him turn into a decrepit old geezer. The reality though is far more mundane. This wasn't done for creative reasons.  Harmony Gold only did this because they aren't allowed to use the original Macross character designs due to the longstanding rights issue. If that's the case why even bother making this movie?! I think it's fair to say most fans want a continuation of the Macross segment, not just a half baked sequel to the Southern Cross and Mospeada segments.

In fact, the SDF-3 is hardly even in the movie.  I thought that was the point of the sequel, to find out what happened to the SDF-3 and to show what is going on aboard that ship.  The writers didn't do that.  The story presumes that the viewer has knowledge of the events of the Sentinels, in which the humans met the Haydonites.  There is really no drama at all with the appearance of the Haydonites, and the revelations that occur later in the story with regard to them come across as just a plot device.  It wasn't shocking at all.

The dialogue is painfully bad.  I cringed watching all the scenes between Marcus Rush and Maia Sterling.  ""Nice skull,"" Marcus tells her in a crowded elevator, complimenting the skull squadron logo on her flight suit.  Could you get any lamer than that?  Is this Ford Riley guy a real screenwriter?  And why is there so much technobabble during all the bridge scenes with Louie Nichols?  I thought I was watching Robotech, not a bad episode of Star Trek TNG.  In typical Star Trek fashion, like the second coming of Wesley Crusher, Louie quickly figures out some obscure technical solution that miraculously saves the day.  He also has a habit of taking everything Vince says literally, which makes Vince angry, and Louie says sorry.  It wasn't funny the first time, so what makes you think it will be funny the second, third, or fourth time?

The animation is also not up to scratch.  While Macross and Robotech are two different franchises, they come from the same genre, so they invite comparison.  The hand drawn (and computer) animation in Macross Plus, made more than 10 years ago, is superior to anything in Shadow Chronicles.  Macross Zero, released four years ago, has vastly superior computer animated mecha battles.  Robotech's mecha designs are simply not realistic enough.  They aren't even better than some amateur CG fanart one can look at these days.  And the animation for the battles was also poor.  Why are all the missile contrails just straight lines of light?  The screen is filled with nothing but straight lines going after the enemies.  More realism or dramatic license would have been preferrable.

I really hated the musical score. The opening title quotes the main Robotech theme for only a few phrases.  The rest of the score sounds like a score to a Star Trek episode, and by that, I mean: not the Ron Jones Star Trek. More like the Dennis McCarthy Star Trek. There are no really distinctive themes to latch onto.  It's meant to be epic, it avoids the cheesiness of the original 80's score, and it has the atmospheric sound and mood, but it is completely bland, generic, and derivative.  Years ago, the composer himself sent me an angry email criticizing my comments telling me I should keep my opinions to myself.  I just found it astonishing that any serious film music composer would deign to respond to an amazon review.  In response, I noted that I only comment on the music because I am an avid film score fan.  Does one need to be a writer in order to criticize a book, or a filmmaker in order to comment on a film?  Is a degree in music composition a pre-requisite to express an opinion on the film score?  Some film composers seem to think they are somehow exempt from criticism since they don't consider regular fans knowledgeable enough so we should ""keep your opinions to yourself.""

Does the movie do anything right?  Not really.  It does sort of resolve the relationship between Scott and Ariel but that's about it.  It resolves nothing else that we wanted to find out at the end of Robotech.  It has good animation compared to... 1985, but it is vastly inferior to the standards of contemporary animation.  Overall I have to say it is a huge disappointment.  Robotech the TV series was great, I thought.  This movie is lousy.  I watched it once and sold it on the secondary market after one viewing.  There is apparently a sequel in production, but why bother?  I just feel after watching this that Robotech is dead. Harmony Gold does not have the talent nor the vision to continue the Robotech storyline in a satisfactory manner; all they know how to do is keep re-releasing their Robotech DVDs to milk their cash cow. They talked about trying to make Shadow Rising, or do some prequel Robotech Academy. Here's what needs to happen in order for this series to continue in a viable manner.  Resolve the longstanding rights issue. Clean house and fire everybody who was involved with this Shadow Chronicles project's creative team, from the top starting with the executive producers all the way down to the individual animators. Get new blood, new vision, new everything. Of course that will never happen because 1) that would cost a lot of money, and 2) the Japanese, probably ruing the day they allowed the distribution rights to go to HG, will never compound their mistake by allowing HG's incompetence to further stain the Macross brand.",1173484800,28,6642,4.721112076455256

After reading some of the negative reviews [...]I really didn't know what to expect. I went ahead and ordered The Shadow Chronicles despite the negative reviews and now all I can say is thank goodness I didn't listen to all the naysayers.

2698373,5,B000KWZ1UM,"This is a worthy addition to the Robotech saga. I'm glad that they have included characters from the Sentinels story. I was a little wary due to some comments from other buyers, but in the end they were useful, because they made me to expect an ok product and that I didn't have high expectations for this movie.

""Robotech The shadow chronicles"" has all the feeling of a major motion picture, maybe a little influenced by the new Galactica tv series and the latest Superman movie (in the aspect of the incidental music, the atmosphere).

The FXs are good, another buyer mentions that they are inferior to Macross Zero, I think they are similar, but this movie, the plot, is way much better than that OVA.

The featurette is informative and funny, I learnt too to program my VCR thanks to Robotech, and hearing Mark Hamill telling us that he didn't Robotech was a franchise makes you answer him: ""Where were you? Inside a cave?"" (Hammil plays both a Commander and a Haydonite).

The success of this movie makes me wonder, What if they film the Robotech books: 19, 20 & 21? And an updated Sentinels movie?",1172966400,,1104,4.588832487309645
2698374,2,B000KWZ1UM,"I just bought and watched The Shadow Chronicles today.  As a big fan of Robotech, I was looking forward it since seeing the trailer released last year and positive reviews from some fans.  After watching it, don't believe the hype and have ultra-high expectations or else you'll be let down like I was.

The first 30 minutes were essentially a re-creation of the final battle against the Invid from the Robotech: New Generation series.  Most of the lines were exactly the same as the original, however they also made some changes that I didn't like.  We all remember Marlene (Ariel) mysteriously appearing as Scott and Lancer were flying towards Reflex Point and the rest of the gang following her to the heart of Reflex Point.  But that's not how it happens in The Shadow Chronicles.  Ariel and Scott meet up in the woods during the battle.  What?  And inside the hive it's just Ariel and the Regis.  The rest of the team isn't there.  Huh?  What can I say?  I hate it when history is rewritten like what they did in this movie.

As for the movie from there on out, it just felt long and dull.  Very dull.  The storyline was okay, but I don't know...the execution of it really never held me on the edge of my seat.  Instead, I found myself slumping back on the couch.  Other things, like Ariel can teleport people (?!) felt totally out of place and takes away from some of the realism.  The jokes aren't all that entertaining, and there really wasn't any quirky/goofy music we were accustomed to in the original series to go with them to set the mood.  And the acting, I think, can be best summed up as if you were watching Star Wars: Episodes I/II/III.  Really bland, no passion, no emotion, and when there was emotion, it sounded really forced.  Just watch the end of the battle with the Invid in which the Regis talks to Ariel.  In the original, she sounded very passionate and powerful with her words.  In The Shadow Chronicles, there's no emotion at all.  It was as if someone sucked the life out of her and she's just plainly talking.  By the end of the movie I was left asking, ""That's it?""

I think The Shadow Chronicles may have been better served had they broken it up into individual 22 minute episodes rather than a feature film.  It would have helped advance the storyline smoother and helped introduce/develop the new characters better, too.

I also would have liked it had they started the film immediately AFTER the final Invid battle.  Everyone getting this has watched Robotech.  There's no need whatsoever to re-create the battle.  We've all seen it, and it felt like a waste of my money that I wasn't getting something original.  When the film is only 85 minutes long and a third of that is re-creating something we've seen, why am I paying for that?  They could have done a brief 2-5 minute recap at the start of the film picking up where the New Generation left off.

If you're a die hard, I'm sure you'll buy it just 'cuz.  But I recommend folks go out and rent it first before making that final decision.",1172880000,10,3029,4.5036764705882355

After that, you wait something good or better to continue this franchise, but this the worst I could ever imagine.

First: Even when the story is at some point clever the producers change the original saga in a very bad way, leaving out good characters to put some innecesary just to fill some things from a plot who is already in the books but much more intrincated (not for a movie). For the fans, some of these changes, If we think well, means a whole new transformation of the saga in other word the producers make very big and bad mistakes just to create a movie instead to be faithful to the whole saga.

Second: For the lovers of the tv-show, the animations it's the worst we could ever imagine, CGI like of ten or twenty years ago, some secuences seems unfinished, there are no details, the differences between styles of animation in the same movie are really big.

 I remember the show as almost a masterpiece but these ""spawn"" only have names and some things from the original story but no respect for the work of the animators as the producer Carl Macek who make the union of the three anime sagas creating the legend of Robotech, and in a time where computers are in every kind of work of the planet, the poorness of this movie is a sin, a ""fan made"" can be better in every single way.",1172620800,8,1503,4.450909090909091

The story is poor and unsatisfying for a long awaited continuation of the saga. The animation is rigid, cold and lifeless and sometimes looks downright amateur. The sound effects are lame. Does it have any good moments in it? Yeah, the opening score that borrows from the original Robotech series, but that is short lived. The rest is just a big expectation that never gets fulfilled, and then it's over.

It's interesting to hear the creators of this film in the ""making of"" bonus feature talk passionately about how they strived to keep the feel of the original series and how proud they are. - People! pardon me but you have failed miserably in that department!

Apparently this is supposed to be the beginning chapter of a new Robotech series. Well if that's the case, my advice would be to fire everybody that was involved in this project and hire others to do it.

In the meantime, if you're hungry for Robotech, stick to Macross Plus or Macross Zero if you haven't seen them already. And if you have, watch 'em again.",1172188800,12,1320,4.556962025316456

So, with that in mind, I sit and watch it... and enjoy it. It is a new saga, and you have to look at it with that in your head. The question are still going to be in there, but since the comics (for example Prelude to RSC) you realized the story was taking a different direction.

As a new story, it is a good begining. My recomedation is to watch it several times and you are going to get the feeling for it. I particulary like the music, very ""John Williams"" with that ""space factor"". Very suitable.

The only thing I didn't like much was the effects, somehow they look very square. Maybe the ones of the serie weren't made by computer, but they were really fluid and with a lot of details, and here you can't see much the details of the ships.

The characters (even they have very unreal perfect bodies, I prefered the old ones), were good, I really like the colors, very vivid.

The story, with the hydonites and everything, reminds me a lot of Battlestar Galactica. Not a copy, but there are similarities.

I personally enjoy it. Some people hate it, but I didn't. My advice is to watch it, with an open mind and with not expectation to get the answers you wanted for so, so... so long. That way you are going to enjoy it for what it is, a new saga.",1172102400,5,1415,4.168498168498169

But that's not the point, and I have to be very honest with this: watching this movie moved me -I was almost on the verge of crying when the opening titles began to appear. After so many years, so many failed attempts, finally we have a continuation to our beloved series...this was REAL ROBOTECH again! Yes, of course, they could have done better; yes, of course, Rick looks weird and yes, none of the guys from the SDF-1 are there, but...who cares? I was actually watching some NEW Robotech material, it seemed a miracle to me! The movie is GREAT because it's Robotech.

2698405,4,B000KWZ1UM,"Before I watched this, I was prepared to be disappointed; I had heard rumors that Shadow Chronicles essentially erased The Sentinels from Robotech lore and picked up at the end of the Invid Invasion.  The latter was true, but I was delighted to discover that despite a few unexpected plot twists, the assumption was that Rick Hunter and the REF had in fact been battling the Invid in the interim.  It was so true to The Sentinels that my brother and I had to pause the DVD on more than one occasion and discuss how it tied in to The Sentinels series.  Sure it's difficult to follow at times, but so are most other anime.  If you're a fan of the entire Robotech series (books included,) you will not be disappointed.

And if you think the dialogue is cheesy, you need to re-watch the First Robotech War and endure the antics of Minmei all over again.  Shadow Chronicles makes a joke about this at the opening of the film when one of the characters is whistling a Minmei tune to annoy his wingman... funny because it's true.",1172016000,5,1022,4.438502673796791

2698407,4,B000KWZ1UM,"I guess I'm a traditional Robotech fan from the late 1980s when I used watch Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Robotech.  I finally was able to get the DVD copies around 2001-2002 and then after season three everything just... stopped.  The books by McKinney were ok and fan speculation was high with the cancelation of the Sentinel series.

Enter Shadow Chronicles; an attempt to renew Robotech with the original voice actors and new story-line to answer what happened to the SDF-3 and the fate of Earth and protoculture.  However, that's where the excitement ends.  Shadow Chronicles is nothing more than the title suggests; a prequel to the sequel.  It pick up right before the end of the last episode in season 3 and ends shortly thereafter, answer maybe one or two questions (that being is Rick Hunter an old man by now) but nothing more.

I was rather disapointed that the movie, for all the hype, was 88 minutes long and a good third of it was rehashing the last episode.  I almost felt cheated... almost.  Nonetheless, the musical renditions of the classic music from the series was excellent to the point where my friends and I were whistling away.  The animation was very smooth and impressive with the combination of CG and animation and of course I enjoy hearing familiar voices... even if Mark Hammil (Applause?) is one of them.

2698410,3,B000KWZ1UM,"Some of my fondest memories as a kid were sitting down to watch Robotech in the mid to late 90s when it was briefly featured on Cartoon Network.  The original show was such a gem considering the time it was made---their was so much substance to it, so much originality---and now, look what it's become...

1.  The CG was awful.  Macross Zero was released earlier and had CG that was far and away superior to anything this film had to offer.  All of the Mecha were awkward and boxier than a 83' Volvo.  It seems as if Harmony Gold was so desperate to get this film to market that they didn't take the hour and 28 minutes to actually watch it and realize that their CG was reminiscent of ""The Last Starfighter"".  Of course...characters that we can actually identify with and a decent story helped too.

2.  The dialogue was largely stilted, stiff and seemed to be either poorly written or poorly translated.  Notable exception to this was Mr. Tony Oliver---still, as always, masterfully giving us the voice of Rick---if only for about three lines.

3.  The techno-speak was overdone to the point of foolishness.  I agree with the other reviewer---""lose this 'delta vector theta niner' [...].  Well said.  We Robotech fans do not need that garbage to fill in the dead air, a simple ""De-Fold"" followed by something constructive would have sufficed.

4.  I'm glad I'll live to see 2044...since all the women have huge racks and perfect bodies at that point in time.  Too bad I'll be in my sixties.  And seriously...blue hair was cool in Max Sterling's (or any Zentraedi...since they're aliens, I'll allow it) case...but can we seriously stop w/ the purple hair/mauve eyes or blue hair/blue eyes combo on every other character?

5.  The movie putters over the finish line with all the grace and style of a heavily drugged elephant, wrapping up with a cliffhanger ending...which is really little more than the same situation the story opened up gift-wrapped in the trappings of accomplishment.  Look at the situation...okay, the Invid left Earth (because they pretty much didn't want it anymore).  What else did the humans really accomplish?  The Haydonites suffered a trivial setback and the SDF-3 is STILL lost.  Hooray!  Our enemies either gave up fighting us or consider us only a minor aggravation!  This is not the humanity-reaffirming Robotech that we know and love.

If I have to wait another ten years to see a quality Robotech product, I will...but if I'm writing another negative review in 2017, I'm gonna be upset.  The title says it all...a little Khyron in this movie would've helped tremendously.",1171670400,21,2604,4.828054298642534
2698411,3,B000KWZ1UM,"Anime fans has been waiting for years for a sequel to the Robotech TV series and the anticipation of ""The Shadow Chronicles"" has only brought more excitement when it was announced in 2004 about the start of the production of a new Movie.

Set at the final attack by the returning Robotech Expeditionary Force against the Invid Hive, we pretty much re-cap what happened at the end from the TV Series.

It has been twenty years since Adm. Hunter left Earth, in search of the Robotech Master's home world and many of the new crew have never set foot on Earth let alone have seen it. But they are all willing to die to free the home world of humanity.

We also introduce a new species, the Children of the Shadow. They gave Humanity the technology to defeat the Invid, specifically the Shadow Devices and the neutron-s missile technology to make them invisible to the Invid. But there is a cost to being allied with enemies of the Invid.

I kind of wonder how much more Earth can handle being pummeled, first by the Zentraedi, then the Robotech Masters, and then the Invid.

If you remember the TV episodes, you should easily catch up with Scott Bernard at the start of the movie. The movie is about 1.5hrs and you are getting an hour of new events. You just have to ignore the exodus of the Invid from Earth and the characters of Scott's Resistance force (because we don't hear about them)

The animation is set at a higher standard since the TV episodes but does not come close to Macross Zero. Characters are much more detailed (females are being more, ahem, classic anime style) and the Veritech fighter battle scenes are a wonder to see.

And, unlike the TV series, we are getting some unexpected deaths during the movie and more graphic then what the usual anime episodes that was usually shown in the US market. If you ever watched the uncensored or original Japanese episodes of, say, Star Blazers (Space Cruiser Yamato) and compare it to what was actually shown in the US, you know what I mean.

You are hearing many familiar names (such as Grant and Sterling), and voices since they managed to get the original voice-over actors, including the voice of Adm. Rick Hunter.

I have to say, I really think the writers of the movie were watching WAY too much Star Trek when they wrote up the script of The Shadow Chronicles as I can clearly see some of the ""style"" of Star Trek in The Shadow Chronicles.

I am not sure how much more I can say about the movie w/o revealing the ending but I will say if you are a fan of Robotech, this is a good continuation of the series. But personally, I was hoping for more then what they gave us and waiting for 20 years since the final TV episode, they should have put more into the story line or make this movie longer.

Some questions do come to mind though...

#1 After 20 years, did Adm. Hunter find the Robotech Master's homeworld?

#2 Has humanity found an extreme fitness craze in the 21st century or did everyone just decide to wear skin tight clothes/uniforms?

#3 How much stress IS Adm. Hunter under since he has aged horribly?  ( I mean come on!  He was gone ONLY 20 years???)

I give this 3 out of 5 Veritech Fighters.

I find it interesting that there were people that disliked the DVD.  I think the reason why they gave such a response is because they have had 20 plus years to romanticize about the best cartoon series ever created.

This DVD was a honorable accomplishment of attempting to please the dedicated fans while trying to sell itself to new fans.  Is there room for improvement, sure.

2698444,4,B000KWZ1UM,"I just ordered this and it's hard to believe it's been over 20 years of Robotech with Shadow Chronicles already out, and some otakus still have issues over Macross and Robotech. Every Macross/Robotech fan has to have their likes and dislikes. Well here's some of the things I recall over the last 20 years of Macross/Robotech.

Robotech became an anime series phenomenon next to Star Wars that consisted of Super Dimensional Fortress Macross, Super Dimensional Cavalry - Southern Cross, and Genesis Climber Mospeada. Macross became widely popular in Japan until Harmony Gold bought the rights to all three shows, altered some of the characters, edited some of the most shocking and violent scenes to make the series ""safer"" for kids to view and rewrote the storylines that would tie all three shows together.

Macross, S.D. Cavalry, and Genesis Climber are originally three separate shows that had nothing to do with each other. Genesis Climber was the less popular show in Japan while Macross and S.D. Cavalry were successful. Harmony Gold changed Cavalry's Lt. Jeanne's name to Dana Sterling tying the series with Macross' Max and Myria as their daughter. After Genesis Climber/New Generation ended, Robotech II: The Sentinels movie (originally was to be a 15 episode series) reveals the beginning of who the Invid were and how they invaded Earth. But for The Sentinels movie you see Dana with Max and Myria for a brief time while Rick and Lisa were going to get married including Minmay realizing she had to move on with her life. But the Invid were already beginning their invasion by attacking the Zors/Robotech Masters who meet their demise which leads to Genesis Climber/New Generation.

After the success of Macross series, the creators decided to make a movie version of the series. Now here is where a percentage of fans disliked about the movie. The story was choppy and I agree with what they are saying but here's the problem, when you make an animated movie from a series consisting of 36 episodes, how are you going to squeeze 900 minutes into a 115 minute movie? If you're the director, you have to make some really hard choices on what and what not to put in. The movie itself centers around the highlighted moments from the series. Yet the story remains the same. There are two versions of the Macross movie. There's Clash of the Bionoids and S.D.F. Macross: Do You Remember Love. Clash of the Bionoids is the English dubbed edited version where a U.S. distributor hacked off 30 mins. of footage with some important scenes that should've remained. Setting aside Myria's massacre attack on the Zentrans, I was so disappointed with 50% of Minmay's ""Do You Remember Love,"" song with Rick blasting away Bedolza's head were edited out. However, I was relieved the uncut, unedited, Japanese dialogue version, S.D.F. Macross, came out on Ebay. The story from the movie may be choppy but the animation is fantastic. Despite every Robotech fans' fixation on the series, the movie itself has some moments that are a different variation from what we know. For instance, Max and Myria's dogfight leading to her ship. In the series, Max persues her but Myria manages to make her getaway onboard her ship. In the movie, Max persues her all the way into her ship where she tries a sneak attack ambush, Max dodges her firing and their fight continues. What I disliked about the series was during the big battle in space with the Zentrandi and Bedolza. The battle was extended with stock footage looping numerous times with Minmay's cheesy ""We Will Win,"" song. Even Bedolza's battle fortress looked totally lame as an oval shaped asteroid compared to the movie version.

Macross Zero is a 5 volume series about Roy Faulker and events that took place sometime before the Zentrandi invasion. In the beginning, Rick/Hikaru is there for a short time to reveal some early moments of their friendship. Roy learns more about himself while fighting in the Union War. As Zero reaches its climax, signs of premonition reveal near future events will occur from what we know from Macross/Robotech. Macross II, Macross 7 and Macross Plus are sequels that take place several hundred years after the end of the Zentrandi and Meltrandi War.

Now we have The Shadow Chronicles Movie where some of the leading characters are from Genesis Climber. With Rick Hunter missing along with the other characters from Macross and Southern Cross. Some fans aren't satisfied with how this movie came about but last year from the Robotech website, they recommended the fans to get the comic-book mini-series of The Shadow Chronicles before the movie came out because it tells the prior half of the story that may have most of the characters from all three shows. But others say the absence of Rick, Lisa, Minmay, Max, Myria and Dana from the movie were due to licensing agreements with the original creators. I have yet to get the comic-book mini-series and to my surprise the Invid are still around after Genesis Climber when Scott Bernard will face a new threat while searching for Rick and SDF-3. And some fans are criticizing over the CGI battle scenes and how some of the female characters were drawn? Please remember Harmony couldn't get the same artists and animators from the old series after 20 years, the characters have to look more grown up as well as we are.",1171238400,7,5342,4.878854625550661

I got to see clips of the movie at GenCon Indy 06, and thought it would be pretty good, but it was better than I could have expected. Also, hear Chase Masterson singing again was an add bonus.

That said, I have 2 complaints. First, with all the returns of beloved characters, there are some that are more MIA than others. Namely, the Sterlings. Where are the rest of them? The SDF-3 excuse seems contrived at best. Second problem, CLIFFHANGER!!! I've waited more than 2 decades for some conclusion, only to have the SDF-3 missing AGAIN. ERRRRR!!!! Tommy, for crying out loud, bring back Rick Hunter instead of teasing us. But, even with these problems, I still love this DVD. If you are a Robotech fan, you'll love it.

To be fair, there are moments where the dialogue comes off as slightly stilted, and the animation isn't quite what it should be, and where character interaction is awkward or exhibits maudlin sentimentality (but hey, those last two traits are part and parcel of Robotech!), but all in all, the production was very good, and lived up to Robotech's nobler traits.  My best friend, who was there with me, commented that ""Robotech has really grown up."" It may not be quite finished, but it has definitely matured, and I look forward to seeing what comes next.",1171152000,3,822,4.571428571428571
2698447,4,B000KWZ1UM,"I grew up watching the original Robotech, and then, for twenty years, there was nothing. Rumors of projects to come came and went, and then, one day, I heard about this project. I was skeptical. Would it follow the Jack McKinney novels? Would it attempt to relaunch the Sentinels storyline? Would there be anything of the characters we knew?

I loved the art for this new series, so much more crisp and vivid than it was twenty years ago. And I was rather pleased with the casting of the characters, including seeing some of the original Robotech cast reprise their roles.

Seeing characters from the first Robotech Series, including Louie Nichols, Scott Bernard, Ariel, and the Invid Regis, as well as Rick Hunter, it was a real treat. And we're reintroduced to Vince Grant and Janice, characters from the Sentinels project.

I also enjoyed some of the newer characters, like Alex, Marcus, and Maia Sterling (a tie to the original Macross portion of Robotech).

There's a clear bit of nostalgia in this series as we hear several characters reference events from the original series, and even hear songs from Lynn Minmei (thankfully not with Reba West's voice this time around) being sung in the background.

The role of the Haydonites has changed drastically from their role in the Jack McKinney novels, letting us know that this will be an original project, and that we're in for something new.

I think that the movie was well done, and I anticipate the follow up series that is sure to come. The one drawback to The Shadow Chronicles as I see it is that as a movie, it is limited by time to the amount of recap that can be done. Fans not familiar with Scott Bernard and Marlene/Ariel, for instance, will be left in the dark.

Overall, enjoyable, but not necessarily everyone's cup of tea.",1171152000,2,1792,4.706070287539936
2698448,4,B000KWZ1UM,"Robotech, the Americanized version of three different Japanese series, returns again in Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles. Only the fans recall the Robotech II: The Sentinels project, and the abysmal Robotech Movie, other attempts at sequels.

The new movie, about 88 minutes long, takes place concurrent with the events at the end of the final two Robotech episodes, from the vantage point of the battle fleet that has come to liberate Earth from the Invid.

Captain Grant, (presumably Bowie's father from the Sentinels), must go off in search of Admiral Hunter, who never appeared with his ship at thestart of the battle.

Scott Bernard from the resistance forces comes aboard one of the ships looking for Hunter also.

The story, animation, and soundtrack are solid, and really do bring back memories. The new animation team did a great job. CGI and cell animation don't quite blend in, but that's not a problem given that it looks visually stunning.

So many characters from the three ""generations"" aren't included that some fans might feel cheated, however this wasn't a problem considering they had only 90 minutes to tell the other side of the space battle, and then introduce a new alien threat.

Presumably there will be other movies or episodes to look forward to!

It was the first real fun animated movie of the year!

Looking back on it several months after this review, I can still say it was one of the most anticipated animated movie for me of the year. Having read most of the criticism since, it hasn't dissuaded me from my original opinion.

And some fans likened it to Macross Plus and Macross 7, two completely different series. This isn't a fair comparison because those series were complete departures based on the Macross saga, the original Japanese series. They also spent more time on those stories. It shows.

Even so, Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles should be treated as an unused pilot movie. If they continue with another, it should be about the search and rescue of the SDF 3 from that planet.

Many critics argued that Rick Hunter was too old. Actually, he would be over 55. (He was 18 in the first episodes set in 2009-2010. It's now 2044. Also, the image on the screen was distorted by the alien singularity. Yeah.",1171065600,4,2246,4.822916666666667
2698449,5,B000KWZ1UM,"I thought Robotech:The Shadow Chronicles was a terrific beginning (hopefully) for a new sequel to the original Robotech. I am a huge fan and loved every minute of it. But as usual die hard fans have to critisize it. Where's Rick & Lisa? It is to Mospeda themed? etc. What did you expect, Rick Hunter to come flying in on Skull One to save the day. It's a sequel for God's sake. I thought it was great, creating new characters like Marcus Rush (Scott's dead girlfriend Marlene's little brother). Robotech is a multi-generation series and always has been. The original covered 3 generations and 3 wars. What was nice about The Shadow Chronicles was the way they represented the 3 generation even the imcomplete Robotech II:The Sentinels. Vince Grant (Claudia Grant's brother- Macross), Scott Bernard & Ariel (The New Generation) JANICE (The Sentinels) & Maia Sterling (Max & Miriya's daughter and Dana's sister - Macross & Masters). I thought Maia was the biggest suprise. Anyone who read the comics Prelude to the Shadow Chronicles would remember Rick saying that ""There's more than one Sterling who can lead the Skull Squadron..."" On the next page you see Dana walking by Maia and her team and assume that they meant Dana. But in fact Maia is Dana's little sister and commander of Skull Squadron. You can already see tension between her and Marcus (Rick & Lisa all over again). For those who said it was missing females in command positions and dorky guys, you must have missing Miai & Marcus and Vince & Jean and as always Scott & Ariel. The one complaint is that they did it as a feature film which left little time to really develope the new characters. Hopefully, this is just a pilot to a new series.

In order to catch up with the plot I would recommend everyone to watch the New Generation Saga all over again and to read the comic book mini series: PRELUDE TO THE SHADOW CHRONICLES,  as they will introduce you to the whole scenario portrayed in the movie; Then again I'm just a long-time fan of the original series and this movie made me re-live the good times I had 17 years ago,

2698451,3,B000KWZ1UM,"I was so happy to finally have this DVD in my hot little hand and I wasted no time popping it into my DVD player after getting home from work today.  I really enjoyed this movie.  It wasn't perfect and you need look no further than the rating I gave this movie.  But I truly, honestly, enjoyed this grand return of Robotech.  Here are some of my thoughts on it.  I really appreciated the effort the creators put into this.  The directors, the voice actors, the artists, the music composers, the  sound engineers  and everyone else all did a marvelous job.  This movie isn't something that was put together by some sleazy investment group who was looking only to cash in on the Robotech name.  The creators genuinely made an effort to give us fans a fat tablespoon of Robotech goodness.  Don't tell me you didn't get goose bumpts when they rolled out those Cyclones or smile from ear to ear when you heard JANICE tease us with a bit of those all too familiar tunes.  Speaking of JANICE, I liked the new characters that were introduced and the new direction of Ariel's character.  Ariel really needed growth and needed to evolve and I think they accomplished that in this movie.  The Shadow Chronicles was a very mature and intelligent  animated movie.  This was by no means a Saturday morning cartoon, not even close.  And I think the musical score did a lot to make it that way.  When you hear the musical score and the sound effects, you get a very real sence of drama, impact, and presence.  But now let's get into the flaws.  This movie was obviously a pilot for an ongoing series which to an extent I'm ok with.  I would have preferred a little more finality to the movie though.  I think you can do a pilot without it feeling like it should have been thirty minutes longer just to tie up the loose ends.  I also would have preferred to have seen a little more drama in the movie.  Although I can understand why they wanted to put out a movie that was heavy on the action.  That's what today's audiences crave and there was a risk that people might lack the patience to see characters fleshed out by featuring more scenes with dialog and emotion.  The creators obviusly wanted to offfer something that would grab old and new fans alike so that they could get an ongoing series started.  It's a smart idea and I hope it works.  If a full blown season of Robotech should come about, I'd really like to see them follow the formula of the original Robotech Macross Saga, that is, a balance of smart storytelling with both drama and action.  After watching the Shadow Chronicles, I'm confident that's exactly what we'll get.  All I have left to say is that Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles is a fun movie that features great action, a cool story, and interesting characters.  Oh, and let's not forget  to mention all the amazing mecha that's displayed too.  Welcome back Robotech!",1170979200,4,2878,4.5048355899419725
2698452,1,B000KWZ1UM,"The reason this movie doesn't work is because -- phenomenal Mecha designs and Epic Space Battles aside -- Robotech has always REALLY been a fantastic and over-the-top Space Opera that -- no matter what anyone says to the contrary -- was basically powered at it's core by the Macross Saga's relentlessly Grey's Anatomy-like Estro-Factor of a (basically) Female Centered Work-Place of the SDF-1 Bridge, some lovable dorky guys in uniform who didn't understand women, and the PERPETUALLY shifting alliances to be found in the Rick/Lisa/Minmei/Kyle Quadrangle much in the way that the NEW Battlestar Galactica is also being powered along by some dorky guys in uniform who don't understand women and the Quadrangle of Doom that is Lee/Kara/Dee/Sam.

2698493,3,B000KWZ1UM,"To be honest, if it hadn't had the ""Robotech"" label on, it would have gotten two stars (or less...).  I've been an avid Robotech fan since I was introduced to the novels back in 1991 (missed it when it first aired on TV).  I went on to read all of the books multiple times and caught every episode at least twice while it was aired on the Sci-Fi channel.  I've built the models, played the RPG and am a retular visitor to robotech.com, so I was, obviously, looking forward to this movie for quite some time.  I should have learned by now that nothing ever lives up to the hype.  Granted, this movie is really only a pilot episode by HG to see just how much $$$ Robotech is still capable of bringing in (hey, money makes the world go round), but they may have alienated more fans than they brought in with this one.  I hate to say it, but first and foremost - as numerous people have already mentioned - the women were so rediculously out of proportion it was like I was watching an episode of Love Hina.  Robotechs light-hearted silliness is based on substance, not rediculous drawings, I mean, c'mon, did a h*rny 13-year-old make that call?  Next, on to the animation quality.  Overall, the animation was ok (hard lines and weak shading not withstanding), but the CG stuff was really disappoinging.  The veritechs looked pretty good, but movement was akward and often choppy.  The explosions ranged from pretty good to just plain lousy.  The ships weren't too bad, but the invid didn't really do it for me either.  I guess CG is the wave of the future, but it will never be able to take the place of hand-drawn animation.  The story and characters also left a lot to be desired - many MAJOR characters were not present or even mentioned.  Rumor has it that some were killed off, while others will 'make their appearance' if another installment is ever made.  The familiar voices were definitely a plus though.  I was more than glad to see just how many of the original cast made it back.  In conclusion, this episode didn't add ALL that much to the story, but it did end rather abruptly to leave us hanging.  As a die-hard Robotech fan, you may feel compelled to buy it, but I urge you to rent, even if it means more won't be made.",1170979200,8,2232,4.41320293398533
2698494,5,B000KWZ1UM,"GREAT! Sure, many people will be overly critical about the show, and sure the movie lacks many things. But if you can watch the entire Robotech series from beginning to end and still appreciate the show, you will love the Shadow Chronicles. Not to say (or spoil) anyhting about the story, but if the studios involved pursue what they have rekindled, I think this movie is a great beginning.

The redesign of the characters are updated and appropriate. The introduction of new characters was done tastefully. The acknowledgment of the original cast was not over done. I think a ""cornier"" reference to Valkaries and the SDF would of been cool, but the show had a very strong, serious Sci-fi tone. The comic relief was par with current anime dub's.

The CG (computer graphics) was surprisigly smooth and detailed. Music! GREAT. Many references to the original soundtrack. The music was appropriate. Great 5.1 surround sound. I think the extra time and expense on the soundtartck was worth it.

For pure Robotech fans I think the studios did a great job! Any true fan would be proud.",1170979200,4,1079,4.821621621621621
2698495,3,B000KWZ1UM,"First, let me say that I consider myself the the biggest Robotech fan. So, my opinion is very honest and heart felt. I followed the making of the Shadow Chronicles from it's conception. Waiting and waiting and was afraid it would never happen. Then it finally came. I got my preorder in early as a matter of fact, and could not wait to put it in. Now, I have to admit. I was a little skeptical, do to watching the featurett on the Robotech web site. I notice I never saw most of the origional cast, except for Scott. Then, I noticed that the mecha action was CGI whitch in my opinion never works as well unless it has a 2D overlay.

Anyway, on to the movie. I first noticed every thing seemed so mospeada themed. No really strong references to either of the first two generations. I already felt this was a bad sign. Then came the worst mistake I think they could have made. While instead of picking up directly where New Generation left off, they tried to re-tell the last few episodes. But, instead of making an accurate retelling they tried to recreate the events of the end of Robotech. So any die-hard fan would be disheartend from the beginning. Now visually it looks great for the most part. Even the mecha looks great. Only problem is, the two formats don't blend well at all. You really feel like your watching two seperate movies at times. This unfortunately would be irritating to even a new comer. Now, like others have said already in different ways, the movie seemed very unfocused. You were left with a feeling that your missing some thing.( I watch it twice in succession just to make sure.)It never really goes anywhere other than introducing new characters, then it's over. It leaves you with more questions than it answers. It only brings back, I believe; 4 characters from the original series. Rick,(who if they did not state it, you would never know) Scott,(Who is the main saving grace of the movie)Louie,(who's OK but, a lonely substitute for a whole cast of missing people.)and Arial(Who would be great if not for her new powers and sudden sense of self awareness that she did not have in the original series.)

I know it seems that I am totally dogging the movie. But, like other fans I am just so happy to have anything robotech. This attempt was better than nothing at all. The thing that's most upsetting is that I knew this would happen due to Harmony Gold's poor relations with the origional creators over the rights for Macross merchandising. I personaly believe that had HarmonyGold work harder over the years to create a working relationship with the origional creators of Macross they would be allowed to create the story I know deep down they wanted to create. Really, think of the possibilities they may have had incorporating some of the new Macross mecha into the storyline.

In closing, the movie feels some what rush while being years in the making. Almost as if they had a movie made years ago then had to start over from scratch right before it's released. Let me say that I have hope for the new series and I definately will be the first to buy. But, please. If you can not do something to fill old continuity plot holes without creating new ones and, staying with the spirit of the original series as you promised that you would, then maby it's better to leave it alone. Remember the Robotech fans are the smartest fans out there. Treat us like we do have a clue....

2698496,2,B000KWZ1UM,"Ok, this is not the conclusion to the Robotech saga, its only another installment. It ties up almost none of the loose ends left at the conclusion of the New Generation. Yes we see Adm Hunter, albeit briefly. The SDF3 is barely shown, no detail to speak of. No hint as to what happened to Lisa or Minmei, only a passing reference to the Sterlings. And *SPOILER ALERT* we leave off at the end in much the same place as we did at the end of the New Generation. The SDF3 is lost in space and Rick needs to be found again.

So if this is a prequel to a new series that contines the Robotech saga (like the Battlestar Galactica miniseries was), then that is GREAT! If this is supposed to be the end of the saga, well then I am VERY disappointed.

I won't bother to go into the technical aspects, since others have covered them well already. I will say that Dana's little sister has a completely ridiculous bust line that is totally unnecessary. And there was a complete lack of any inspirational music, either instrumental or vocal, which was pretty much the centerpiece of the original Robotech saga. The graphics left a bit to be desired as well. Body movements were unnatural for the most part.

I should also mention that the techno-speak used in the script was awful. All this 'T vector delta' crap could have been made more realistic with a little more effort.

All in all, not worth the wait unfortunately.",1170892800,10,1408,4.445736434108527

Maybe it was the long wait for it to finally come out and all the hype from the website, but I was a bit disappointed with this movie. First of all, there was all this hype about Mark Hamill doing one of the voices. He has about 3 or 4 lines and is in the movie for all of one minute. Rick Hunter is barely in it as well, and Scott Bernard seems like more of an afterthought character who doesn't have much to do through most of the movie except look confused. The story was so so, and the CGI battle scenes, although nice and shinny, move stiffly and with the fluidity of a early 80's video game.

Its been 20 years since the Frankenstein series Robotech left the airwaves and while the combination of three distinctly different Japanese produced animated series had its share of issues it served as the entry vector for the classic anime fan of the 80's and 90's. Set up as a generational saga like say - North and South - Robotech portrayed Earth through a series of alien assaults and rebuilding processes. The original setting - based on the Macross TV show is usually the most resonant with The New Generation and Southern Cross falling in different places based on individual tastes. 85 episodes in total were combined to allow Harmony Gold to syndicate the series for morning and afternoon cartoon broadcast (back when there were such things - before the advent of 24 hour cartoon networks).

Numerous attempts were made to continue the series with new stories and originally produced animation and the sequel: Robotech II The Sentinels almost saw the light of day until the bottom fell out of the dollar and production became far too expensive. Despite the loss of animation Del Rey and Harmony Gold continued the series in book form while Eternity comics brought the series to that medium. Five novels and countless comics later the story of the Sentinels was resolved and left many fans upset that the adventures of Admirals Rick and Lisa Hunter, Commander Scott Berhnard and the other popular character would never see animated conclusion.

Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles is the latest and so far only successful attempt to resurrect the series for animation. Picking up immediately after the end of the last aired episode of the Robotech television how - Symphony of Light - the film shows a returning Robotech Expeditionary Force preparing to assault the Invid forces and liberate Earth. Fans of the series already know how the battle ends but it is an interesting story point that serves to introduce a new cast of characters and brings some of the Sentinels cast to the screen as well.

Shadow Chronicles does a little playing with the established cannon of the final New Generation episode and ignores the lauded final book of the novel series - End of the Circle while maintaining many of the characters and plots of that novel. Soon Earth is free of the Invid but facing a new threat from forces they believed to be allied. - thus establishing a possible new direction for the franchise and serving as a back door pilot for further TV or movie stories.

Anyone who followed Robotech through the novels and comic books will be justly rewarded in the story department - concepts and characters from the series are carried forward but that is one of the root problems for this film. Speaking as a fan of the franchise I enjoyed the fact that the film showed me the return of the REF to Earth with Vince Grant, Maia Sterling and Louis Nichols. I also enjoyed the subplots with the android JANICE and the Haydonites.. but if you're not a die hard fan you'd find all of that extraneous and probably very confusing.

You may not need to know who these characters are beforehand to get the story but there is one critical piece of the puzzle missing to introduce the new concept - at no point does the film stop to explain well how the Haydonites and Shadow technology came into the picture. These are crucial developmental plot points that get a second or two of explanation and are quickly glossed over - despite how important they are to the film.

The search for Admiral Hunter - the original launching point that cap-stoned the original story is really not the focus of this film, instead we get set piece battles between CGI Veritechs and Invid and later the Children of Shadow forces. The story does resolve well and opens the way for that search but it feels like a lot of buildup with little payoff should the series end here.

The animation mixture of 2D and 3D styles is uneven and frankly somewhat amateurish. There is some sense of fight and flight choreography in the 3D animation but the models are jarring when set next to the fluid bright digital 2D animation. I won't be too critical as the majority of this film was produced two or three years ago and it has aged poorly awaiting a distributor.

The character redesign is understood, as the rights to the original Macross and New Generation characters are not owned by Harmony Gold but the brief appearance of Rick Hunter might leave fans wondering who the heck that grey haired old guy is - since he does not resemble the character in the slightest. Additionally the introduction of Marlene Rush's brother Marcus is strange as he does not recognize Ariel as Marlene's clone when they meet - no mention is even made of her resemblance to Marlene - a key plot element from the original series.

All of the old cast return in some form or another and it's great to have Scott Bernard as front and center in the story while introducing a new ""Rick, Ben and Roy"" with the Marcus, Alex and Maia characters. The voice acting is superior to many of the Direct to DVD animation projects and with a cast so experienced that is not surprising - one minor quibble is the billing the box art gives to Mark Hamil who plays Wolf Squadron Commander and is the voice of a Haydonite in the film - both of which are 10 second parts. Banking on his voice talent is one thing - but at least give him a good role.

Now I entered into The Shadow Chronicles as a long term fan. I'm someone who has written pages of fiction since I was 10 years old detailing my version of this beloved universe and having read every available source of Robotech content since it left the air. I didn't expect too much honestly and because of that I was pleasantly surprised by the results. No this is not the Robotech I cherished, its a new story with new creators and an new, more modern sensibility. It appears that the creators kept some of the interesting elements of the non-animated works but threw away a lot of the drek.

I would not object to the continuation of this story with the hopes of some explanation of the Sentinels and some story resolution somewhere down the line featuring the classic characters I've loved for so long. The new characters and returning characters bled well - incorporating elements of New Generation, Southern Cross and Sentinels will keep me interested as the creators spin their own yarn. Watch Shadow Chronicles with an open mind if you're a fan of the original series, but you may have to translate for someone who isn't which keeps this from being the best way to reignite the Robotech franchise for new viewers.",1170806400,10,6609,4.658662092624357

My only gripe is I think the character design is a bit poor - I wish they had simply made them look like they do in the original show (Vince Grant looks particularly weird).

They've also ""sexed up"" this new version of Robotech: every single female character has preposterously large breasts (even the Regis!) which are bursting out of their clothes.

8159292,5,B000KWZ1UM,"A nice attempt to resurrect an awesome series, unfortunately without the help of a huge studio it didn't fly long on a niche audience. The Robotech franchise needs a real boost like Star Wars, Transformers and Lord of the Rings all got:money and complete vision of the entire series. For true fans of the series it is worth seeing just as the Robotech: Sentinels film was.",1513382400,,372,4.651515151515151
8159293,3,B000KWZ1UM,"This movie was so over hyped and just ended up falling flat. This doesn't feel like Robotech to me with its outdated CGI sequences and lazy animation. The movie didn't really feel like Robotech to me, the story was weak, the characters meh, and the film was extremely short and abrupt for the amount of excitement that was built up for this Harmony Gold product. This film didn't do anything for me Robotech wise than show me some CGI fight sequences that look outdated now, have no emotions, and was just not impressive in any way. The film falls flat and ends up feeling soul-less and forgettable for being a Robotech anime film. I enjoyed Macross Plus more than this film, and that didn't even take place during the Robotech wars but I felt was done better overall. This movie did not capture the spirit of Robotech, better luck next time. Maybe one day the dedicated fans of Robotech will get their new show and movies after the lawsuits settle, and people with the right minds can take this series into the future once again.",1511740800,,1030,4.572972972972973

8159295,4,B000KWZ1UM,Four stars for Robotech fans and three stars for Macross fans. For anyone else that has not already been exposed to these series than you might need to watch it more than once to understand the movie. But a good buy for anyone that enjoys mecha anime. Definitely a good add it to your anime collection.,1484524800,,302,4.410714285714286

8159299,5,B000KWZ1UM,"This  was not a ""awful"" film. I was alive when the Robotech saga came out. It is an excellent supplement. The graphics are great! (And don't try to tell me how to rate graphics!) I like that Mark Hammel had a part. The storyline was action-packed and  had a couple of nice plot twists. Don't  listen to  ""purists."" I  remember when a couple of criticism rated a movie with ""two thumbs down."" They were wrong about the  first Star Wars; and  looked like fools the second day after it opened. This is the same situation.",1442793600,2,518,4.389473684210526
