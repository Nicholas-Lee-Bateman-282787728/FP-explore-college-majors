then it struck me as quite a adventure of the sword/fantasy kind.
With knights, dragons, witches and so much more, this movie became a jewel. Now that its available on video, its still produces tingling effects as after all these years its still
quite entertaining and still produces that smile at the end.
Enjoy.",1026691200,3,376,4.463768115942029
467646,3,630247809X,"If you saw this film when it first came out, like I did, you'll be delighted that it's available. If you didn't and you are expecting something from the ""digital era"" you may be very disappointed. This is a kids film. I love this film for the escape. Are there ruff edges? Sure. I am a fan of Gary Lockwood (2001:a space odyssey)and it is fun to see him back then. Basil Rathbone can never do any wrong. Ann Helm? What's not to love? So...enjoy it for what it is and you'll love it. The 1963 version of ""The Thief of Bagdad"" with Steve Reeves is the same kind of escape. If you want to get a bit ""heady"" about these films, they are about struggle. I can always place myself somewhere in there (they both have 7 stages of strife) and it can actually help me figure out things at times.

468020,3,630247809X,"I saw this in the theater when I was ten years old. As a young boy it made quite an impression on me. I thought it was the bee's knees. I figured to re-visit it and see how it held up. Not very well I'm afraid.

Here's the scoop. Sir George (Gary Lockwood) is infatuated with Princess Helene (Ann Helm) from a distance. She is kidnapped by the wizard Lodac (Basil Rathbone) who is going to feed her to his dragon. Sir George grabs a magic sword, armor and horse form his stepmom (a delightful Estelle Winwood) and heads out with some other knights to do the rescue thing. Another knight, with less honorable intentions, is in on the rescue.

Bert L. Gordon wrote, directed and did the special effects here. His film history would put him somewhere north of Roger Corman but way south of say...Steven Spielberg. His movies were all pretty cheesy and seemed to be aimed for a younger, less discerning audience. That's the case here. Some of the sets, to a young eye, would have carried great impact. Now they look very cliche and cheap. He also bathed certain scenes in red light which is distracting. The effects, likewise, were budget effects that haven't withstood the test of time. The ogre in one scene is so obviously wearing a mask you have to giggle. I'm not certain how Basil Rathbone agreed to do this. I noticed he had a handful of years left in his career and did nothing else of real note, but he doesn't slack here. Winwood is cool as the stepmom and Lockwood is Okay. The rest of the performances vary widely.

All that aside, this is still a fun watch if you want a trip down memory lane. Now that I've satisfied my curiosity I don't see myself going back to this ever again.",1336089600,,1689,4.407051282051282

The movie is almost 50 years old, so the special affects are dated, but the premise of the story is still good.

468025,3,630247809X,"This is a decent - probably Bert I Gordons' best picture with a good solid cast, above average effects. It is a sword sorcery and sandal movie. A young Gary Lockwood is off to save the princess Helene from Lodac who is none other than Basil Rathbone. Not Basil's best,but it is still entertaining. Call it a mild fantasy, but entertaining and fun. With Ogres, Dragons, and other assorted wonders.. This movie was good or bad enough to be on MST3K with Crow falling for Estelle Winwood and sings a song about her.

468027,3,630247809X,"Two and a half stars.

Sometimes, one's fondness for a pet can be taken to extremes. Case in point, the wicked sorcerer Lodac who, to feed his dragon, makes a habit of kidnapping princesses. If they aren't ransomed within seven days' time, it's chow time for the dragon. THE MAGIC SWORD checks off on many of the traditional fairy tale tropes. When fair Princess Helene is taken by Lodac, the king vows that whosoever rescues her shall have her hand in marriage and half the kingdom, as well.

Of a royal lineage but raised by a witch, a doughty young man named George undertakes this challenge. But he doesn't do it bare-handed. Taking with him his mother's gifts intended for his 21st birthday, he begins his quest armed with an unpierceable mail armor, an enchanted sword which can open and shut any door, and a fabulously swift stallion. But, even with these remarkable gifts, and accompanied by seven knights (one of whom is a traitorous blight), George must brave the seven deadly curses to reach the evil sorcerer's castle.

If I'd seen this flick when I was a kid, maybe, just maybe, nostalgia might've caused me to think better of it. But I saw this about half an hour ago, and, truth is, I'm not so impressed. Coming out in 1962, THE MAGIC SWORD nowadays might do as Saturday morning fare for the pre-teens, although, with the current advanced state of special effects, even they might pooh-pooh this one. I'm thinking, only kids who still enjoy claymation and other ungainly type of f/x might get a kick out of the cheesy fantasy brought to life in this picture. There are ogres here, and vile hags and fiery dragons, and they all don't look that convincing. Its campy qualites caused THE MAGIC SWORD to be featured in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.

The by-the-numbers story can be overlooked, I guess, but what really hampers the flick are the actors' colorless performances. Gary Lockwood as the hero and Anne Helm as the fair princess are fairly innocuous and so very un-medieval-like. Meanwhile, Basil Rathbone - looking tired, decades into his acting career - and Estelle Winwood both ham it up as, respectively, the sorcerous heavy and the hero's witchy surrogate mother Sybil. Sybil, sneered by Rathbone as a ""tenth rate"" witch, is a hit or miss character (most of the other characters are plainly ""misses""). Her personality draws echoes of those hapless relatives of Samantha's in BEWITCHED.

There's an absence of vibrancy onscreen, which renders THE MAGIC SWORD a lesser fantasy film. If you watch classic films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thief-of-Bagdad-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00152VXUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thief of Bagdad - Criterion Collection</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jason-and-the-Argonauts/dp/0767810864/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jason and the Argonauts</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-7th-Voyage-of-Sinbad-50th-Anniversary-Edition-1958/dp/B001DB6J50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (50th Anniversary Edition) (1958)</a>, you can't help but be swept away by their energy and enthusiasm and scope, not to mention the just plain good craftsmanship. In trying to come up with something positive to say about this film, I do think it's interesting that the six resurrected knights hail from different nations. Sadly, they all perish like bad film actors.

One thing happens early on in the film, which probably straight away set me in critique mode. I wasn't at all down with how cooly George tricks his mother and locks her away (although, yes, she was a witch, so she wasn't exactly helpless; but, still, that was brutal!). And, lastly, what the hell was up with the chimp?",1227916800,3,3811,5.562068965517241
468028,3,630247809X,"The Magic Sword is pretty much a standard medieval fantasy story that has all the ingredients necessary for such a movie. A young hero with humble beginnings, a princess searching for love, an evil sorcerer (with a dragon that has a sweet tooth for princesses), monsters, knights, kings and all that lot. The story is as solid as any fairy tale, but the execution is a bit on the lacking side. In other words recite the movie to your kids at bedtime and it all seems great, but this production doesn't live up to what your child's imagination would have made of it.

For one the action and adventure of the movie are tapered down to accomodate the stage sets and whatnot. There really is no true action in this film. No Errol Flynn style swordplay. No Ray Harryhausen style monsters. Just lots of quick camera shots that don't really show much action. It would have been nice that since they are following the standard Hollywood formula for a medieval fantasy film to at least throw in the things that make such films fun to watch.

Another detail that bugs me were the six valiant knights that were reanimated to help out our hero. They talk the talk and are gallant and all that, but to be honest they didn't do much at all to help our hero. No heroic fighting. They just died incrementally like so many red shirted extras in a classic Star Trek episode. And don't even get me started about the surprise at the end that doesn't even try to explain itself.

The acting is the solid kind you find from theater performers acting in a movie such as this. Nothing over the top and nothing too understated. The music is also a solid performer even if there isn't a memorable melody to be found (great as incidental music, though). The special effects aren't all that special, but it's not the worst. It's what you would normally see in the early 60's for a movie with a modest (though not miniscule) effect budget. Things like the dragon look good, but don't move around as well as they should.

This DVD is only one to look at out of the many that were made for this movie. For one it's the cleanest transfer, and for some of those previous releases the difference is significant. Also this DVD is in Dolby stereo and has subtitles in Spanish, French and English.

I'm not going to say The Magic Sword is a bad movie because it has several endearing moments thanks to the actors and some of the scenes they play. I'm also not going to say The Magic Sword is the best that 1962 has to offer for this genre. Considering how many of these types of films were made back then I would say this is a solid production.",1227916800,,2607,4.411642411642411

This film plays as nothing more than a poorly made Saturday morning childrens show.  The special effects are ridiculous and so poorly done it's obvious that this film doesn't even rate as a B-movie.

And here I am fifteen years later buying it as a keepsake/memory.  This MGM version blew the previous two veiwings away.  The picture, color and sound quality was superb.  I am extremely happy with my purchase of this item.",1180224000,,496,4.279569892473118
468109,3,630247809X,"Evil sorcerer Lodac (Basil Rathbone) takes his revenge on the King by abducting Princess Helene (Anne Helm) to feed her to a dragon in a week.  Ambitious courtier Sir Branton (Liam Sullivan) proposes to go alone to rescue her.  The obscure, but noble, protagonist, Sir George (Gary Lockwood), uses the gifts of his good-witch foster mother, Sibyl (Estelle Winwood), to re-animate six knights to go after the Princess, his vision-love. Lodac guards his castle with seven curses, including the double-headed dragon.  The movie plays out straightforwardly to the expected conclusion using the technology of the early 1960's.  It's all good fun.

The first time I saw the movie was from a $1 bargain bin version from ""Treasure Box Collection,"" a good value, especially since it was bundled with a second film, ""King Arthur: The Young Warlord"".  I enjoyed their ""The Magic Sword"" but wanted it with a better quality picture.  The MGM version has an excellent picture and sound.

The MGM version has an additional four-minute scene about 30 minutes into the film, in which a harassed Princess Helene breaks free of her prison cell and meets Little People kept in cages for eating. Lodac returns her to her cell.  The Little People show up later to release George from his bindings in the dungeon and are otherwise not explained.

The one and only annoyance of the MGM version compared to the ""Treasure Box Collection"" version is that MGM's has a different aspect ratio and sizing.  The MGM version is wider, but cuts off portions of the scene that appear at the bottom (or maybe top as well) of the TBC version.  While the letterbox aspect ratio is standard, why don't they show the entire movie however the aspect ratio falls out?  For me the difference was most noticable in George's dungeon scenes.

I couldn't believe my luck at finding this DVD in the bargain bin at my local retailer for only 5.50!!!  Basil Rathbones name alone sold me this movie.

I really really want my 5.50 back.  The so called special effects are ludicrous.  The props are ridiculous, and the makeup is beyond laughably bad.  Basil Rathbone is doing his best to ham it up as the evil sorceror Lodac, but just barely manages to phone it in.  What a waste of the talent that gave us Sherlock Holmes and Sir Guy of Gisbourne.  I cant tell if the rest of the actors even realize they're in such a bad movie, or if they know and just don't care.  The awkward pauses between every line in the actors vocal exchanges and movements seem to suggest that they are waiting for some idiot with a cue card to tell them what to do.  Even Mr Rathbone suffers from this affliction.  Blame this on the somewhat less than classic Director Bert L Gordon.

I actually tried to watch this movie three times before I managed to get all the way through it, just to say I could.  I put this on my shelf next to Godzilla's Revenge in the ""How in the heck can this movie even exist"" department, never to be watched again.  Unless you're a movie masochist, blind, deaf, or just have a few dollars with nothing else in the entire world to spend it on, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME.",1145318400,2,1575,4.404844290657439

The picture is clear, the sound is crisp (thank you MGM). Also this is the full version (120 minutes). The alpha version cut out a 3 minute segment where 2 dwarfs sneak into the princess's cell and try to grope her.

The special effects are dated (the movie did come out in 1962), but the story and characters are great. This is a really great ""good VS evil"" film. A true underated classic. Great for the whole family (kids and adults).",1143244800,8,580,4.2727272727272725

468113,4,630247809X,"""The Magic Sword"" is one of B-movie producer/director Bert I. Gordon's best known films. Granted, it's no masterpiece, but it is enjoyable on it's own terms. The plot, very loosely based on the 'St. George And The Dragon' legend, has a princess (Anne Helm) kidnapped by evil sorcerer Lodac (Basil Rathbone) and hunted by lovesick George (Gary Lockwood). Aided by his foster mother Sybil (Estelle Winwood) a good witch, George vows to save the princess and destroy Lodac. Although this plot has been done to death, it's the acting by the splendid Rathbone and Winwood which keeps this film consistently entertaining. Add some modest, but impressive special effects, and you have a very entertaining minor adventure for the family. Beware: this public domain film is available on several cut-rate DVDs, but only the newly released one from MGM/UA home video is worth the price. They have a beautiful print of the film (it was originally released by United Artists) which contains a fun theatrical trailer. This is the one to get!

Before George can rescue her, he must first conquer the seven deadly curses that guard the way to Lodac's castle and defeat hoards of ghouls and demons that stand in his way. George is aided in his quest to free Helene by his stepmother Sybil the Sorceress and six mythical Knights she has conjured up with her powers.

They used to show this movie once in awhile on Saturday afternoons when I was a kid. I didn't remember much about this movie, but I ordered it from Amazon anyway. Much to my delight, I found the ""Magic Sword"" to be very entertaining and still enjoyable after all these years. Kudos' to MGM Studios for releasing the ""Magic Sword"" on DVD. I think MGM did a remarkable job with the picture and sound quality of this movie considering it was made in 1962.

The video transfer is crisp and clean, the colors are positively vibrant and the sound is really decent for a movie this old. I really enjoyed seeing Basil Rathbone as the evil sorcerer Lodac, he did a great job. If you're a fan of the old adventure / fantasy classics like the ""Jack the Giant Killer"" and ""Sinbad"", then the ""Magic Sword"" may be for you.

Can Sir George with the aid of his speedy horse, special suit of invincible armor, magic sword and six mythical Knights be able to conquer the evil Lodac? You have to buy the ""Magic sword"" to find out.

This movie holds a special place in my movie heart along with ""Jack the Giant Killer"" and ""Jason and the Argonauts."" I've seen several absolutely horrible VHS and DVD transfers of this movie (mostly public domain crap) and was very excited to hear that MGM would be releasing a remastered version. However, upon viewing MGM's ""widescreen"" version, I was very disappointed to note that it's not widescreen at all, just the full screen version matted at the top and bottom to give the appearance of widescreen. Doing a freeze frame comparison with the Platinum disc version of ""The Magic Sword,"" it is very easy to see that there is no additional information on either side, and a significant amount of information cropped off the top and bottom. The color and clarity are great, but the loss of info at the top and bottom is unacceptable. I'll stick with the full screen Platinum disc. It's a great movie, either way, though.

468217,3,630247809X,"The Magic Sword might seem a bit childish and hokey but it's actually quite a bit of fun fantasy.  It has some scarry moments for the youngest and could cause nightmares for the more impressionable but with all the incredible advances in special effects the kiddies are exposed to these days they will probably laugh at this, but I loved it !!  It was released in 1962 and was reviewed by Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine the same year.  It was directed by Bert I. Gordon and stars Gary Lockwood (2001 A Space Odyssey '68), Richard Kiel (The Spy Who Loved Me '77, Moonraker '74. Eeagh! '62), Anne Helm (Follow That Dream '61), Basil Rathbone (The Adventures of Robin Hood, etc. etc. etc...) and Maila (Vampira) Nurmi.  This is probably the best thing Bert I. Gordon ever did.  Bert directed Begining of the End and Earth vs the Spider.  Later in his career he did Food of the Gods and Empire of the Ants.

Basil kidnaps our princess to feed to the dragon.  The king is promising half the kingdom and the girl's hand in marriage, and now you should know where Terry Gilliam went with this promise in Jabberwocky '77.  We've got 7 deadly curses and all the actors are obviously having quite a bit of fun along the way.

In 2003 Alpha released a DVD of this but the quality was ABYSMAL.  This new release is reportedly in widescreen and one can hope that with the proper attention now we will get the quality the DVD medium offers if handled correctly.

OK, now it's been released and I was pleasantly surprised to see a very good quality DVD.  It's widescreen and the clarity is pretty darn good for as old as this movie is.  There's alot of rich color, maybe too much but it 's not as saturated as say, The Quiet Man which was way too thick in color saturation.  Now I recommend this higher than originally anticipated and give it 4 stars.  There's no extras to speak of but I think it's worth the price just to get a good copy of this.

A knight with a magic sword goes on a quest to rescue a beautiful princess from an evil wizard. After trapping a witch (who I swore was Phillis Diller), he gets a magic sword and brings to life six knights, each from a different nation.

Well the knights face danger and are picked off until they arrive at the Evil Sorceror's castle (which looks surprisingly like a farmhouse!) After fighting a double headed sock puppet dragon. The knight wins his true love.

And the evil wizard? He is mad his dragon has been killed. He is about to unleash a fury like no one has ever seen. ""I am INVINCABLE!"" he proclaims with outstretched arms.

468219,3,630247809X,"This movie was directed by Bert I. Gordon...a legend in ""B"" movies and the man who brought us such films as Earth Vs. the Spider, Picture Mommy Dead, and ""War of the Colossal Beast""  Knowing that, how could anyone resonably expect anything more than the low-budget fare that Mr. Gordon had always provided?

In this low budget, Saturday movie matinee type film, The evil sorcerer Lodac (Basil Rathbone) captures Princess Helene and whisks her off to his castle. Young Knight Sir George (Gary Lockwood), and aided by a magic sword, sets off with his six knights to save her. However, he must travel with Sir Franton, who also has romantic aspirations for the Princess. Together the knights must face Lodac's seven curses and liberate the Princess.

To me this is one of those movies like ""Captain Sinbad"" with Guy Williams that just enchanted me as a young boy.  It isn't quality film-making and doesn't pretend to be.  I'm sure the films that so entrall my kids today will be looked on as hokey and cheap 30 years from now as well and that's ok because it was a film squarely aimed at kids.

Rathbone is, of course, a shell of his former self and it's a bit sad to see him in this, one of his final films, especially recalling how dashing he was back in the 30's and 40's.  There's no one else in the cast remotely worth noting.  The special effects were cheap but hey, it's still a fun movie to watch if you KNOW what you are going to see.

But for what it is worth, I first saw it as a kid, it was one of my favorite stories as a kid and now, as an adult, I am glad to have it in my collection.  It is good escapist material after a day's work - not every day, of course.  And it does go well with cheese and beer.  Some people will say that it is cheesey enough on its own. Maybe they need more beer!  You could do a lot worse than this - especially if you have kids in the house.  I know.  I'm in my 50's and I'm still a kid.

A witch mother with a two headed servant, a special sword, armor and steed intended for Sir George when he reached manhood and a group of famous knights as companions for the quest who are from all over Europe. There is also some great campish humor in this film, especially when the ""French"" knight is drawn away by a pretty damsel singing in french and when he attempts to kiss her she turns into a horrible one eyed-monster, and upon being saved by Sir George he states: ""I should have realized that such a beautiful woman would not be up so early in the morning!"" The film also features silly ogres who throw logs like nine pins but get dizzy and fall over from watching a horse run in circles, the usual servant/sinister midgets who seem to terrify people by just standing around holding up their clenched hands and laughing mockingly,vaporous pools of death that knights on horseback seem to automatically lose their balance and fall into to die, caves full of ghostly witches that only the faith of an Irishman can confront and a genuinely good Dragon full of fire breathing fury at the end that is killed by our hero as he is about to feed on our princess.

468224,3,630247809X,"Apparently Ray Harryhausen's big success with ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" inspired all sorts of sword and sorcery epics (filmed in Cinemascope). Case in point would be this 1962 film, ""The Magic Sword,"" a three-word title that makes the S&S genre perfectly clear. The film is directed and co-written by Bert I. Gordon, who gave us ""The Cyclops,"" ""The Amazing Colossal Man,"" and ""Earth vs. the Spider,"" and actually ends up being one of his better efforts, helped, no doubt, by the money put into the film for color and special effects. But keep in mind that the rest of those films are really bad. ""The Magic Sword"" also stars the aging Basil Rathbone as the sorcerer, Lodac, and the young Gary Lockwood of ""2001"" fame as the hero, Sir George. Rathbone does well when he appears on screens, but the rest of the cast is not up to his level and the special effects are average at best (although the dragon at the end is the best of the bunch).
The story is by the numbers for this genre. Sir George has been raised by a witch named Sybil (Estelle Windwood), and has used her magic to spy on the beautiful Princess Helene (Anne Helm). She ends up being abducted by Lodac who plans to feed her to the aforementioned dragon. When the King (Merritt Stone) does the old bit about who ever rescues his daughter gets her hand in marriage, Sir George is off on his quest to the evil sorcerer's castle. Our hero is aided and abetted by six knights that he restores from being petrified. This is good because they have to face seven curses from Lodac and having seven knights makes it sound fair but we all know this is going to get down to just (all together now) Sir George and the Dragon. Along the way Gordon to throw all sorts of witches, ogres, helpful little people, and the like at our band of heroes. I am sorry I missed it when ""The Magic Sword"" played on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" because this film is a natural for that venue.
