8095091,5,B000C1VAEW,"This film is well-done. The atmosphere of Jackie Presser's rise to power in the IBT is captured.  Brian Dennehy played a great JACKIE PRESSER.  Jeff Daniels is the consummate ""calm-under-fire"" FBI field man. Where did they get the guy to play DANNY GREENE? This guy was awesome! Bob Prosky plays the shadowy MAISHE ROCKMAN with a tour-de-force. Anyhow, Cleveland MOB/UNION political fighting of the 1970's (car bombs, hits, trips to NYC) are represented. Worth every penny.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mobbed-Up-Jackie-Presser-s-High-Wire-Life-in-the-Teamsters-the-Mafia-and-the-FBI/dp/087113344X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mobbed Up: Jackie Presser's High-Wire Life in the Teamsters, the Mafia, and the FBI</a>",1180137600,4,758,7.228260869565218
