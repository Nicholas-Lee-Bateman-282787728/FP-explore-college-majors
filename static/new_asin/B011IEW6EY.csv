I thought it was stale, artificial and just down right not entertaining. It was really low-budget and it showed.

7333209,2,B011IEW6EY,"""If it's a war they want, I'll bring it to their doorstep."" After finding his brother murdered, Jimmy (White) wants to find out who and why. He starts his own investigation but the more he uncovers the messier it gets. What started off has a quest for the truth becomes a war of a personal nature and no one can be trusted. There really isn't a whole lot to say about this movie. These little action B-movies are essentially all the same and you know what to expect. The biggest glaring flaw in this though is the acting. White and Austin are their normal selves, but the supporting cast is distractingly bad. It is almost like watching a bad middle school production sometimes. That said, most people don't watch this for the acting. If they did they wouldn't make it 10 minutes into the movie. As for the actual movie, it's a little generic and simple but again those that want to watch this go in knowing what to expect. Overall, a typical B-movie with some of the worst acting I have ever seen. I give it a C-.",1442793600,4,1014,4.37037037037037
7333210,4,B011IEW6EY,"CHAIN OF COMMAND and DEADLY TARGET are the same film. James Webster (Michael Jai White) returns home from Iraqistan where he was a highly trained special ops assassin. He meets his brother and a few of his old friends and soon a couple of them are dead. James attempts to find out who killed them and what is going on while he is being hunted.  Ray Peters (Steve Austin) who ""likes problems"" and is ""not cheap"" is called in to clean up the mess using poorly written tough guy lines like ""looks are perception.""

Michael Jai White plays a convincing assassin, while everyone else dies around him. Steve Austin gives us a bit about poor veterans' benefits as justification for murder and drug smuggling, something that didn't really help the case.

7333239,1,B011IEW6EY,"I really like Michael Jai White.  But this movie was a waste of the talents of everyone who appeared on the screen.  I don't think there was an armorer on the project, nor was there any sensible gun handling on the part of anyone in the cast.  What fights there were... and there were only a couple, displayed a lack of basic fight dynamics that you usually only see when six year old little boys are roughhousing.  The dialog was not really dialog, but a string of random, unemotional, disconnected, cliched statements, as though the players were untrained high middle school grammar class members being forced to take turns reading from Beowulf. I am pretty sure there was no director anywhere near the shots most of the time...  Maybe there was, but he was napping, I am sure, if there actually was a director.  Most high school skits are favored with better acting and more believable scripts and dialog.  If you think you are going to see some of the very good martial arts that Mr. White is know for...  you have another thing coming.  This character wanders around with a gun and just shoots people.  Sure, the bad guys get shot, but there is absolutely no emotional connection to any character. Mr. White's character is really a jerk who just murders bad guys out of hand.  The bad guys are just bigger jerks.  So, to wrap it up. No good fights.  Very few fights. Very little action, unless you consider guys carrying bags down a truck ramp action.  Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of  B O R I N G  talk (Not really any meaningful conversation at all... not even for a few seconds. Honest.).  Oh, and Steve Austin is in it, too.  Not that you would notice except for he is the really big guy in the room when people who are not being directed are T A L K I N G about their crisis...  They should have just put a camera up in a garage and all had a pizza party.  That would have been more entertaining, more exiting, more genuine, and had more action.",1457827200,2,2061,4.317708333333333

The bad guys, who are supposedly smuggling a ton of drugs over years and handling millions of dollars are driving the cheapest piece of crap vehicles you have ever seen!!

I know not to expect much from a low budgeted action movie but this was heavily lacking on all levels from the acting to very little action to the point where there wasn't even a fight scene between the two main actions of Austin & White while the plot didn't hold my interest at all.

7333269,1,B011IEW6EY,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

If you find yourself in need of rest and don't have a bottle of Sominex or even Benadryl on hand then you might want to consider popping this movie into your machine. It truly is a bad movie on all levels and while its classified as an action film the odds are it will help you sleep in no time flat.

Michael Jai White stars as special operative James Webster who has just finished a tour of duty and returned home. At his return party his brother seems concerned after a phone call but assures James its nothing and that hell explain it all later. He never gets the chance as hes murdered during the night. Now James tried to find out who is responsible with vengeance on his mind.

As he digs deeper into what happened James discovers a plot involving members of the government and a shipment of drugs. How his brother is tied in isn't revealed until later in the film. As he continues his investigation the drug runners try to put an end to it as fast as possible. The head man even calls in a professional to assist him in the form of Ray Peters (Steve Austin). The odd thing is that after calling him in his man keeps telling him they can handle things and yet never seem able to do so.

I like Michael Jai White. I came to know his career first when he appeared as Spawn in the movie of the same name. Critics hated the movie but I enjoyed it. I thought he did a great job. Years later I loved his performance and creativity with BLACK DYNAMITE, a movie I still recommend to people. So when I see him in movies like this it pains me. He has far more potential than it seems Hollywood is willing to allow him to live up to. Thats too bad because he deserves better than this.

As much of a waste as White is here, Austin is even worse. While hes not the greatest of actors he has shown he is capable of handling a decent role and here he doesnt get the opportunity to do squat. Hes given lengthy tirades to direct at the man who hired him that don't even come up to par with the promos he did while working in the WWE. Worse yet, he has fewer action scenes here than almost anyone in the movie. Why hire someone who is known for that and keep them from it?

Its difficult to decide what the worst thing on display here is. The script is terrible with dialogue that is below second rate. The cinematography is passable but below standard. The sets look terrible and out of place, especially the bad guys office. They show a glass building from the outside and when we go to the office its a hole in the wall with an old steam pipe heater by the windows that look nothing like the windows seen outside. The devil is in the details and no details were even considered here.

I hate to say a movie it terrible beyond belief. I know that the efforts of people who do things from being grips to set decorators to wardrobe people to assistants are behind every movie made. But whoever was at the helm of this movie let down that entire staff and owes them a deep apology. This is one movie that I have to say you should stay clear of at all costs.",1443484800,2,3102,4.177257525083612
