8167825,1,B000MCHF22,Disappointed. Not very much helpful information. Very vague. Not something for someone who has a Yorkie or looking to get one. Not enough specific information. Thank you.,1435622400,,170,5.333333333333333
8167826,2,B000MCHF22,"There were a lot of good training tips in this dvd.  But it seemed she was training a ""trained"" dog.  I want to see how to make them sit still long enough to train them....no tips on this dvd on that!!  I want to see a dvd where the puppy is wiggling all over the place and how to calm him down long enough to train him.",1368576000,,320,3.746268656716418

8167828,5,B000MCHF22,"Thanks to great DVD's like this one, my family and I decided to get not one but two yorkies. We looked at another breed,but after reading and watching this DVD we decided this was the best breed for us. Without great information out there about the differant breeds we might of made a mistake. I advise everyone to read about a breed before buying them. It will be better for the animal and for you and your family. Thanks for putting out a Great DVD.",1225324800,2,451,4.317647058823529
