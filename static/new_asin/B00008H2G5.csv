7983913,5,B00008H2G5,"Yusuke Urameshi is a high school delinquent. He doesn't go to class, and he's always getting in fights. One day he is trying to save a boy that is about to be hit by a car, he is killed instead. He is approached by a pretty girl flying on a broom. Her name is Botan, and she's the Grimm Reaper. She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.

After round 3 Yusuke must gain the power Genkai has been storing for decades all at once. The test may kill him, but it's the only way to beat Toguro. There is also a price. Genkai may be unable to fight in the finals. If she is alive that is.

This is  a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1471,4.118466898954704
7983914,1,B00008H2G5,"This DVD in english version is really bad,because in the english version it's not even close with the japanese version. In the english version it's like they've made their own Yu Yu Hakusho.
I'll prefer the spanish dub of the japanese version.",1078531200,,243,4.809523809523809
7983915,1,B00008H2G5,"If you prefer the original,superior Japanese version,this DVD basically is missing an episode. It's incomplete,and bad. BAAAAAD.",1078444800,,128,6.588235294117647
7983916,2,B00008H2G5,"As you have probably read in other reviews, this Dvd has its glitches. The animation and sound are perfect, but the Japanese subtitles for episode 44, Yusuke's Final Test, are replaced with the Japanese subtitles for episode 45, Hiei Battles On. I would wait to purchase this Dvd until Funimation has fixed the problem.",1059609600,3,319,4.925925925925926
7983917,2,B00008H2G5,"I love this show, and content-wise, I would give it a 4-star rating.
But, as other reviewers have previously mentioned, the Japanese subtitles for episode 44 are, in fact, for episode 45.  Everyone I know that bought the defective version of this disk, including myself, have made numerous attempts to contact Funimation concerning the error, and although they have acknowledged the error, they've done NOTHING to correct it, or publicly admit the disk was in error. That is why I am giving this disk such a poor rating.
Otherwise, the series is excellent, with wonderful characterization, and the other, *unflawed* disks are a great buy.",1058659200,5,638,5.076190476190476
7983918,5,B00008H2G5,"There is alot they cut out on cartoon network. It's much better than the edited version. Yusuke is finally going his final test of Genkai. Well if you watched it on Tv you seen what happened, but not it is well worth to watch.  Kurama, Hiei, and Kuwabara are fighting the next team by them selves. Hiei is wanting to fight them all, but Kurama wanting them to fight evenly as much a possible. Kuwabara wants to fight the leader. But Kuwabara doesn't have much of a chance with this team. In this Kurama and Yusuke teases Hiei about him and his sister, but no one Knows what's going on. It's pretty funny. Yusuke's egg finally hatches. It is a little funny looking. I laughed when I saw it. But of course everyone been teaseing Yusuke of it. So Yusuke teases Hiei of his sister. Kurama and Yusuke are not afraid of Hiei but Botan is. It's pretty funny this volume. But at the last episode Kurama goes in a change of form and personallity. What a shock. But you won't be able to trully see him untill the next tape. This is so funny. I love this anime series, it is trully a great anime of action, romance, and comedy in one. It fits perfectly together. This made me laugh so hard I really did love it when Kurama asked Hiei to join them playing cards and said it was like they was a family and Hiei told him don't make me bring out your music voice box. I wonder what that is of Kurama's? Oh well I probably won't find out any time soon. Here are the Episodes on this tape. Uncut Is way better.
43). The Masked Fighter Revealed
44). Yusuke's Final Test
45). Hiei Battles On
46). Many Faces, Many Forms
I think you should watch the Uncut version to understand the jokes better. It makes much more since to me.",1055808000,4,1707,4.252307692307692
