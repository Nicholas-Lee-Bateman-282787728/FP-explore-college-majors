1340049,5,B00004CSO5,"i saw Crossings when it was shown on TV as a mini-series and loved it.
I had always regretted not purchasing the VHS at the time. For many years I have searched for this in a DVD format and found it a month ago.
So for anyone who is interested I purchased it from Edge Video in Brewer, Maine!  The price was good and the DVD is excellent!",1300752000,17,338,3.9705882352941178
1340050,5,B00004CSO5,I saw the Mini Series several years ago and have been looking for a DVD copy ever since. Great movie - what is taking so long??,1293062400,4,127,3.923076923076923
1340051,5,B00004CSO5,"Like many others, I first saw this movie quite a few years ago and loved it.  The story is beautiful and wonderfully acted.  I have been a fan of Cheryl Ladd's for years.  I find it very frustrating that quite a few of her movies are not available on dvd.  There is so much rubbish available and yet good quality movies with so much heartfelt emotion such as this one, cannot be purchased.  I am sincerely wishing and hoping that the requests of all the fans regarding dvd access to this movie, will be heard and granted.",1287014400,8,521,4.329896907216495
1340052,5,B00004CSO5,"I, also would like to see this movie put on DVD.  I loved the beautiful locales, the romance and the feeling of being swept up in that time period.

1340054,5,B00004CSO5,I don't understand why this is not available on DVD all the other Danielle Steele movies are. I have been trying for years to complete my collection and this was the best of all of them. It is one of the best love stories. Can someone plese contact the right people to get this on DVD.

1340122,1,B00004CSO5,I guess I misunderstood this . CANNOT be used in American Blu ray or DVD players!!!,1456876800,,83,4.25

1340127,1,B00004CSO5,"I am really upset with this purchase as I did not see on the order that I could not play it on
my regular dvd player or my new dvd player either.  I am upset as I have wanted this dvd for a long tim
and now I cannot even play it at all.  I cannot afford to purchase another dvd player.  so what do
you suggest I do with this?",1435536000,,325,3.5492957746478875
1340128,1,B00004CSO5,I should have read more closely. This DVD is NOT for US players. Wasted my money.,1434240000,,81,4.125
1340129,5,B00004CSO5,"I have read almost all DS books & have seen all the movies.  This is by far one of the best, most complex & well researched.  First of all please note you need a Region free DVD player.

Liane Crockett deVilliers (Cheryl Ladd) is a woman caught by circumstances beyond her control in a net of conflicting passions and divided loyalties as World War II involves her family. She is the wife of the French Ambassador who has been called home from Washington.  Crossing the Atlantic to France Liane & her husband meet Nick (Lee Horsley) & Hillary Burnham.  Nick owns one of the world's largest steel mills.  There is a spark between Nick & Liane but they do not act upon it or admit it.  Then a second crossing finds Nick & Liane together as they have been forced to flee France without their families or spouses.

The voyage is dangerous.  The ship is bombed.  Another ship sailing nearby is bombed and sinking.  Nick & Liane work to rescue the survivors & make soup to feed them.  It was an exhausting voyage & Nick & Liane admit they love each other,  but when the crossing ends. Nick & Liane walk away from their love.  Liane's husband is still is France & Nick's wife has refused to leave Europe despite the urging that she do so or be caught in the Nazi web.

Moving between Paris, New York and San Francisco and vividly portraying the events of the World War II Crossings carries Liane toward a final choice.  This is the story of lives interrupted by World War II and interwoven into the fabric of history.

NOTE:  There are no subtitles but the picture is clear & the sound is excellent.  My husband has severe hearing difficulties and he can hear most of the movie except when they whisper.

Music is by Michel Legrand & the songs are wonderful.

Danielle Steel has written many books with World War II as the background.  This is simply one of the best involving the US government, the French resistance, Nazi haters, the war in the Pacific and peace in San Francisco.",1433376000,,1975,4.4581005586592175
1340130,1,B00004CSO5,The DVD I received will not work.  The information on the back is not in English.  I think that this DVD is not compatible to U.S. machines.  I was very disappointed.  I love mini series and this was one I had not seen before.,1431302400,,226,4.068181818181818
1340161,5,B00004CSO5,Saw this years ago. Absolutely love Lee Horsley. Great movie!!,1426204800,,62,5.3
1340162,1,B00004CSO5,i cannot  use it  because the region encoding is 2.  will not play on my dvd player.  need one that is region 1  or region free,1402704000,,127,3.730769230769231
1340163,5,B00004CSO5,"The DVD arrived quickly and was in perfect condition... I've already seen it a couple times, and the Toshiba multi region DVD I bought so I could watch it worked immediately and without issue.  Thank you! CJ",1401321600,3,207,4.594594594594595
1340164,5,B00004CSO5,"Not only is this my favorite Danielle Steel adaptation, it's also compared with many other TV productions one of the best. Almost the caliber of ""North and South"" and ""The Winds of War"".

I watched this WW II trilogy numerous times on TV over the past decades, before I read the book.
Actually the novel cannot live up to this 3 parts TV movie.
What I enjoyed more in the movie than in the novel (in the book Armand does not have an adult son) was the fact that Armand DeVilliers had a son from his first marriage and we can watch two blossoming relationships blossoming (Cheryl Ladd and Lee Horsley, Joanna Pacula and the actor who plays Armand's son) and one very nasty relationship (Lee Horsley's wife...Jane Seymour in her probably best TV role ever).

I think 5 stars are not enough.
The book is a bit too fluffy for my taste, the TV adaptation is very compelling.
I can highly recommend it.",1391126400,,896,4.4573170731707314
1340165,5,B00004CSO5,I have watched this movie several times since purchasing it.  The casting was great and WWII offers such rich historical background.,1388793600,2,132,5.285714285714286
1340166,5,B00004CSO5,"I too, am waiting to have this on DVD, and went on Ms. Steele's website and sent her an e-mail located under contact us.  I bet if everyone sent her an e-mail, it might just get released!",1361577600,,187,4.054054054054054

Great service, fast delievery. Any time again.  Thanks.",1359158400,,158,3.9375
1340168,4,B00004CSO5,I just recieved  crossings. I did enjoy watching it. I was however a little dissapointing. They left out Le anns children. It was some time ago I read the book. I do not remember Le anns husbands son at all. He did add to the plot of the movie. The love story is typical Daniel Steele. It was worth the money. I do so enjoy my non usa format player. All in all it is a good movie.,1357948800,,380,3.871794871794872
1340169,5,B00004CSO5,This is one of the best love stories I have seen.  I don't understand why it is taking so long to be released on dvd or perhaps at least bringing it back on TV. Is there someone that can be contacted to try and make this happen?,1327363200,,228,3.851063829787234
1340170,5,B00004CSO5,"I always adored this mini series. Recently, with help i was able to locate, and purchase the complete series. The storyline, and the cast were outstanding. I only wish Ms. Steele would release crossing so others who never had a chance to view this mini series could do so now. What a wonderful heartwarming love story.",1309996800,,318,4.696428571428571
7920240,5,B00004CSO5,"Great heart-warming movie! Adapted from the excellent Danielle Steel novel and starring Lee Horsley (of ""Matt Houston"" fame) and Cheryl Ladd (""Charlie's Angels"") in the lead rolls. A great love story with a wonderful ending.",1501718400,,224,5.428571428571429

7920242,1,B00004CSO5,The movie did not work - very disappointed,1485129600,,42,4.375
7920243,5,B00004CSO5,I was concerned this dvd would not live up to my expectations.  But it did.  It was a glossy reminder of days gone by when these productions had higher production budgets.  By today's standards it may seem dated but not for me.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was Danielle Steele soap opera at its best.,1475798400,,301,4.4
7920244,5,B00004CSO5,It was not in english.,1473552000,,22,3.6
7920245,3,B00004CSO5,I wish the seller had told me it was for foreign dvd players.  Great dvd but I cannot play it in the US!,1473465600,,104,3.5217391304347827
7920246,1,B00004CSO5,It could not be planned in the US.,1467244800,,34,3.375
7920247,5,B00004CSO5,"I've been looking for this miniseries for years and now Amazon has it.  It is not a United States formatted product so you have to buy a player which will play it, but it is a very high quality recording.  The story is wonderful just like most of Danielle Steele's books.  The wardrobe is vintage and very beautiful as are the stars.  Glad I bought it!",1462147200,,352,4.287878787878788
7920248,5,B00004CSO5,It is a great movie.,1461024000,,20,3.2
7920249,4,B00004CSO5,"This is an old Danielle Steele, 3-night event movie that has not been on television is years and I requested it from Amazon.  Of course, they had it or knew someone that had it, so I purchased it and was so elated to see I could get it, I did not read all the print.  It takes a Multi Region DVD Player to see this movie on, which I do not have.  But, in remembering how good this novel and the 3-night movie was, as soon as I can afford to buy the dvd player, I will purchase it and look at the movie.  Be sure if anyone else buys this movie, you read all the print attached so you do not make the same mistake.  Because it is a movie that has been shown in a lot of foreign countries, it takes a certain type of dvd player.  It is up to Danielle Steele's standards and a very good movie!",1458259200,2,789,3.869565217391304
