8638549,2,B00I30MQE2,"The film consists of three loosely connected shorted films of about 30 minutes from three different directors. It opens with a whimsical disclaimer, setting the audience up for light campy humor.  The first features opens up okay, but then starts to drag as the inane plot becomes boring. The second feature captivates us with Harriet Price (Lara Lemon) but goes nowhere. The third episode which should have brought things together was a bust.

Occasional mild humor. Close up of person throwing up a bucket of blood.

The most comical aspect was the IMDB criticism of the Nazi uniforms as if this was a historical documentary : ""The Female SS Officers uniform is shown the be the Pre-1939 Black SS Uniform. These were discontinued at the start of the war. SS Uniforms were changed to the same colors used by the Wehrmacht. The only black uniforms were worn by the SS and Wehrmacht Panzer (Tank) crews. The Female SS Officers black Uniform also has a Deaths Head patch on the left side and it should be on the right side. Also this patch was only worn by SS Officers that served in Concentration camp duty. She also has a Luftwaffe patch on her left arm and this would never be worn on an SS officers uniform. She also has no rank patch that should be on the left collar. Also female SS members did not wear the same uniforms as the male SS Officers. They also only served in a secondary positions, mostly as guards in the women's section of the Concentration camps and were not permitted to give orders to male SS Officers of lower or equal rank.""

If you like to have fun while you're watching movies, then this movie is for you.  It doesn't take itself too seriously and has plenty of Angry Nazi Zombies to go around.  With a title like that how could you go wrong?  I recommend this title with enthusiasm.",1392940800,3,354,4.014285714285714

Some great scenes - well acted and slick throughout.
Not high-art but very entertaining.
I recommend this to the horror geeks out there.",1392940800,2,207,5.303030303030303
