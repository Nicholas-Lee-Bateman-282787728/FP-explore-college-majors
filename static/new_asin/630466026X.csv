904439,4,630466026X,"Outstanding! I've been looking for this for years and now I've finally found it here. It's a raunchier ""Kentucky Fried Movie"", if such a thing is possible. I believe that this is also a Zucker bros. film.",913248000,,204,4.54054054054054
7875229,4,630466026X,"Fun movie, some of the bits run a little long, but overall entertaining.",1169078400,,72,4.615384615384615
7875230,4,630466026X,"There are some real laughs in this movie.  Also some real clever ways to dress up body parts.  I haven't seen it in a long long time, but still remember many skits to this very day.  Think of it as a period piece humor-wise.",1025222400,,224,4.045454545454546
7875231,2,630466026X,"Incredibly crude, stupid and sophomoric send-up of movies and TV that would be done much better in Tunnelvision and Kentucky Fried Movie.
GT is a series of unrelated skits, most of which are full of sex and drugs references which seem very dated.  Probably the most offensive is a commerical from the Uranus Corporation and you can guess what that is about.
One of the longer forms in this movie is a sketch called ""The Dealers"" which stars Richard Belzer, later famous for his role on ""Homicide"".  Chevy Chase also appears briefly (since he was in Tunnelvision, I suppose that his early career consisted of parts like this.)
GT opens up funny enough, with a group of apes surrounding a strange object, as in ""2001"".  But the movie just degenerates into a never ending series of dumb skits, that are just gross, sick or stupid (a VD sketch featuring male genitalia is a good example).  Another sketch featuring Koko the Clown as a kiddie show host who reads porn to children is not only unfunny, but is in extremely bad taste.
There are enough naked women in this film to interest a typical drunken college student (like I was when this came out).  Drunk or sober, I didn't find this movie to be particularly well done or particularly funny.",1004918400,,1241,4.648401826484018
7875232,5,630466026X,"This movie is revolutionary in the arts of comedic film.  Ken Shapiro is ""ingenius boss your are a genius""~Rodreguez (Richard Beltzer).  This film has everything A perverted clown, the grandest material known to  man Brown 25, the festive recipe only found in the Kramp Kitchen, and yes  the porno (well as much as he could show us).  Every second of this film is  magnificant you will watch it hundreds of times and still find new humor  every viewing.  It is a true cult classic but anyone who watches it will  find it hilarious.  It is well worth the price, the funniest thing you can  watch without being high, The Groove Tube.",965260800,2,631,4.594594594594595
7875233,3,630466026X,"This is an all time favorite of mine. WARNING!  It is raunchy at times and the production quality isn't the greatest, but it has its' moments of glory! The Cooking show sketch is an absolute riot and we have done our own  version of this Julia Child spoof for many skit nights with youth groups  and kids' camps. Check it out if you love stupid humor making fun of local  television affiliate programs of the '70's!",963792000,,415,4.421052631578948
7875234,4,630466026X,"I first saw this movie about five years ago with a friend who had just had surgery.  She nearly busted her stitches out.  You will not laugh harder than when this movie hits its target.  There are some sketches that miss  their target, but overall, it is really funny, and best of all there are  several different levels of humor, if you like slapstick, there is plenty  here.  If you are more intellectual, and like irony, this movie has that,  too.  I just bought it and it is even better now that I am a little older  and get some of the references.  Check out ""Brown 25,"" ""The  Dealers,"" and ""Koko the Clown.""  These three, especially  should have you near tears.",943833600,15,667,4.404958677685951
7875235,5,630466026X,"I completely disagree with most of the reviews I saw. It is not hit and miss comedy with throwaway skits. It's brillant comedy with great social com mentary. It refected the times and is still fresh to this day. FORGET  AUSTIN POWERS.No it's not a Zucker brothers films. Shaprio is much much  more talented and original than them and most of the ""comedy""  writers/directors working today.",935712000,4,388,4.848484848484849
