8710114,5,B00VH3MBB0,"I was very impressed with this video. It is of National Geographic quality, and it all has been done by one person, Nick Hope, who was the writer, the director and the narrator.

As a scuba diver,  I have many Fish ID books, which are great for identifying a fish or a creature, but they give very little information (if any) about fish behaviour.  In this video, there are many interesting facts about fish and creatures.  It is like a video encyclopedia.  This video is 1.5-hour long, or better to say 1.5-hour short, because I wish it was mush longer. It could be enjoyed by anyone.  Divers and snorkelers will love it, but for divers who have already been or planning to go to Lembeh (like me) it is a real treasure.",1489795200,4,720,4.416666666666667
