8755547,5,B01DD4KQ26,"ff Bridges is simply awesome, as is the supporting cast.  Such a great story, superb acting and great music from Bridges and Colin Farrell.  Will be on my regular watch list for years to come.  T Bone Burnett and the late Stephen Bruton write the superb songs.",1507334400,,260,4.48936170212766
