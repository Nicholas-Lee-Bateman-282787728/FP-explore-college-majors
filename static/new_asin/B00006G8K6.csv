1755601,5,B00006G8K6,"My 9 year old grandson and I have watched this DVD on TV, but it was very hard to find it again, having the DVD in our collection allows us to choose when we want to watch the DVD.  The DVD arrived on time and in perfect condition.",1352505600,,231,3.8125
1755602,1,B00006G8K6,"It might have been an interesting video, I don't know because my player said: ""this video can't be seen here"". So it was an ""1"" marked video. Like it was on amazon.co.uk.....

1755603,4,B00006G8K6,"This product was produced by the National Geographic so quality of the disc and production are high. The leader of the search team is Dr Bob Ballard the man who discovered the resting place of the titanic some five miles below the surface of the north atlantic. This endeavour takes us to the south western pacific archipeligo of the solomons and neighbouring isles. the search is difficult and frustrating but eventually the team are rewarded. What remains of the little ""mosquito boat"" is not much considering she was essentialy constructed of plywood and was carved in two by a destroyer of the imperial japanese navy the evening she was lost. But what is discovered provides a poignant reminder of the dark, dangerous days of world war II.This program will appeal to those intersted in Jack Kennedy, maritime salvage and the WWII officionado. I suggest that this item be purchased in unison with the companion book ""collision with history, the search for Kennedy's PT-109""also currently available through Amazon.",1329782400,7,1016,5.089820359281437
1755604,5,B00006G8K6,The Search for Kennedy's PT 109 is a keeper for any academic historian and National Geographic collector. It is the first time I could listen to and appreciate the words of Edward Kennedy. Because for the first time he wasn't speaking about his out of whack and out of touch left political agenda. Instead he spoke of his love for his brother and the Greatest Generation. This documentary is a good one.,1306195200,4,403,4.611111111111111

1755628,3,B00006G8K6,"Never positively identified sunken boat. It was a PT. NO actual proof it was JFK's PT 109. A military historian declared it was PT 109 when only part of one torpedo tube  was showing above the ocean floor. There was some very good interviews with some locals who were involved in JFK rescue. These were moving, the Ballard portion was very disappointing.",1457827200,3,354,4.709677419354839
1755629,5,B00006G8K6,My daughter and I saw this at the Sixth Floor Museum gift shop. She wanted it so we saved $20 buying it on amazon. It has a short bonus program on the Navajo code talkers. Both programs were excellent. My elderly father thoroughly enjoyed it also. I couldn't find this on any streaming service.,1453075200,,294,4.462962962962963

1755647,5,B00006G8K6,We all know Robert Ballard can find a lot of things in the ocean and its a great story of what happened to JFK during the WW2,1406160000,,125,3.6666666666666665

1755649,4,B00006G8K6,"This NG documentary is worth the purchase, but only if you are a really big fan of the events that transpired.  Anything done by NG and Robert Ballard you cannot go wrong.",1397692800,,171,4.34375
1755650,5,B00006G8K6,Always fascinating to watch the research and effort Dr. Ballard's team puts into finding lost ships (and boats).  A must see.,1391472000,,125,4.9523809523809526
1755651,5,B00006G8K6,This one is a great one for finding the truth amongst the myth. It is especially moving to see a young Kennedy come back to the island.,1387584000,,135,4.037037037037037
1755652,3,B00006G8K6,"Personally, I was expecting more.  Don't get me wrong, it was well done and even made me tear up at one point.  I was hoping for more of the back story though on JFK and the incident as well as the science of locating it.  That was barely touched on.  It was no search for the Titanic if you know what I mean.",1380758400,,309,3.857142857142857
1755653,4,B00006G8K6,"This 2002 Ballard expedition covers more about Kennedy and his rescuers than life on a PT boat.  It would help to watch the Hollywood version of PT-109 before this to get a better overall idea of what is being talked about.  A confusing point is the the computer animation of the collision, which at first is a view at sea level of the destroyer coming at the port side, then changes to a bird's eye view of the destroyer impacting the starboard side, the latter being correct.

The 20 minute bonus program is War Code Navajo, regarding the Native American tribe that contributed to the war effort by a program started in the Marines to speak in a native language over field radios that the Japanese would be unprepared to translate.  Two veterans of this unit are interviewed at home. and one revisits Iwo Jima 50 years after the battle.  Watch the Hollywood film Windtalkers for more.",1372118400,,886,4.617834394904459
1755654,2,B00006G8K6,"Anti-climatic.  They find something, but don't uncover it.  So, why go looking for it?  Not particularly interesting or compelling.  The actual story of the ship going down is much more fascinating than what is recreated here.",1362614400,2,226,5.194444444444445
7968525,5,B00006G8K6,A great documentary about the search for a forgotten piece of World War 2 history. A 80 foot marine plywood torpedo boot that in 1943 was crucial in the Solomons Islands at the time in the south Pacific Ocean.,1522540800,,209,4.384615384615385

7968529,5,B00006G8K6,"Actually, I believe the DVD exceeded my expectation.  I was impressed with the way the clues were found and followed in locating the remains of the 109.  I was touched with the interviews of the two Islanders who were instrumental in the rescue were heart wrenching.  They knew him for such a short time, but these men must have seen some of what the voting American Public saw of him in 1961.  I saw the movie PT109 on board an MSTS troop transport in 1964 while we were on the way to Okinawa.  At that time, missed the true story, missed who this PT Skipper really grew to be by the responsibility that was forced on him at the moment the 109 crossed paths with the Japanese Destroyer.
  Thanks for making the location story real and to see what so many Marines, Soldiers and Sailors gave, and gave up for the freedoms we seem to just take for granted.  My dad was in the area of the Philippine Islands during the same time period, that seems to make another connection with the Search for Kennedy's PT-109.
  If you have the chance, and you enjoy searches for ships and archaeological adventures, this is a DVD to get and enjoy again and again.  I have viewed the movie again and again, and still thrill at the location of the 109, the comments and commentaries of his former shipmates and those who were were instrumental in the rescue. Bigger than life then, bigger than memories now.
ENJOY!",1504742400,,1396,4.456692913385827

7968531,5,B00006G8K6,"I'm a big fan of JFK, but I never really knew the story of the PT 109. I do now. This tells JFK's story alongside the story of searching for the boat. Very engaging and worthwhile. Robert Ballard is a good guide--so much of what he does I find interesting.",1500076800,,256,4.14
