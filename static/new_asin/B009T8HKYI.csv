5367490,5,B009T8HKYI,"I am a 53 year old woman and have been grief stricken for months over the loss of my mother and sister. I've watched this movie with my 22 year old daughter, and we both came away feeling enlightened. It helped me to realize that death is not the end no matter what the viewpoint. I have been searching for a sign from my past loved ones, but now I realize it may not come in the form I had been expecting. The movie gave me a sense of well-being and taught me that grief is an ongoing process felt by many people all in different ways, and that it is okay to take as much time as YOU personally need to heal.",1374969600,4,609,3.959349593495935
5367491,5,B009T8HKYI,"Really loved this movie!! Highly recommend.

A profoundly beautiful video that shows that the process of dying and rebirth is a basic function of life in everything we do and everything we become.",1370995200,2,196,4.9393939393939394
5367492,5,B009T8HKYI,"The film resonated with me in so many ways. I have experienced the loss of loved ones, and even though I have gone through grief support groups and therapy, for those losses, this movie added a whole new perspective on dealing with loss. It also changed my outlook on life. I am more conscious of how precious life is now in a way that I never was before. I had many aha moments while watching it. I also always find near death experiences hopeful in helping me to believe there is more to life than the physical world. Who would of thought a film on death would be so helpful for living life. Can't say enough about how great it is. I respect the film maker for trekking into such an uncharted territory.",1369612800,2,705,4.30827067669173
5367493,5,B009T8HKYI,"Wonderful and elegant film... Death As Life truly examines a variety of perspectives and experiences around death. Their stories and theories will open a new conversation within yourself and with others, initiating a deeper, more thoughtful life experience. This film can enlighten you, bring peace to those in grief, and remind some of us how to live again.",1369180800,,358,5.189655172413793
5367494,5,B009T8HKYI,"This film sheds light on the death, dying, and loss by giving the viewer a glimpse into the many varied perspectives of this universal experience.  Creating a conversation about a topic that is all too often taboo and yet profoundly affects us all.  I highly recommended watching this film.  By bringing this topic out of the dark and into the light, hope and healing can begin to blossom.",1358899200,3,389,4.6911764705882355
5367495,5,B009T8HKYI,This film is very thought provoking. I loved the way each subject surrounding death is presented and discussed. The overall message of the film is positive and enlightening.,1352419200,,173,5.214285714285714
8544198,5,B009T8HKYI,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect out of this film, but the topic intrigued me enough to give it a go. At the very beginning, it throws you into the conversation about death without any build up to it. I thought that was an interesting way to begin the journey of this taboo topic. It was refreshing to not only hear professionals in the field talk about death but also ordinary people and their personal experiences. I also enjoyed the unbiased approach of introducing multiple perspectives from different religions. I even learned some new things! As someone who struggles with the concept of death and the unknowingness of what happens after life, it was comforting to listen to other opinions. The film helped me to not shy away from this inevitable thing that will happen to us all. I'd definitely recommend this film to family and friends who share the same discomfort as I do about this topic.",1490486400,,901,4.672955974842767
8544199,3,B009T8HKYI,"Watched three quarters of it and then turned it off. I wasn't getting anything from it. It may help others to think about the topic, and that may be helpful to them. Although, for myself, I was disappointed that the documentary was ordinary people just giving there experiences, thoughts and feelings. I was hoping that the documentary would provide more experts or at least people that have studied the topic much more. And when people spoke about a Hindu or Buddhist perspective, it was often stereotyped thoughts, not very accurate.",1470355200,,535,4.955555555555556
8544200,1,B009T8HKYI,"When I rented the movie ""Death As Life"" I was so excited to watch it, but it turned out very disappointing! First this is NOT a movie this is a documentary! And not well done! This called ""movie"" is a bunch of people sharing their opinions on a subject they don`t know much about it! I am sorry this is my opinion!",1459814400,,314,4.080645161290323
8544201,5,B009T8HKYI,"This is such a fascinating, eye-opening, thought-provoking documentary-- changing our view of death as a negative concept and replacing it with hope and joy and what waits for us on the other side. Sofia does a great job of including viewpoints of death from SEVERAL religions, including Christianity, Buddhism, Kabbalah, Hinduism and many others (giving a well-rounded approach to this subject). As an anthropologist, I thoroughly enjoyed the anthropologist's research on death and the afterlife. The stories and quotes throughout the film were truly moving.",1457654400,2,559,5.588235294117647
8544202,4,B009T8HKYI,"It was okay,all stuff I heard before.",1454544000,,37,4.428571428571429
8544203,1,B009T8HKYI,"Not at all what I expected. Am not interested in how Buddhists handle death of loved ones. Or how atheists handle death.  The Christian faith in Heaven was hardly mentioned except by a psychic. I did not care for the movie at all, a complete waste of time and money.",1440460800,,266,4.32
8544204,5,B009T8HKYI,"A brilliant film on death. It is hard to imagine how such a difficult subject can be brought to light so well. You have to see the film to understand. It has been a God send for me to help heal from the recent loss of a loved one.  I noted other reviews saying it helped people with life, and I can see why they said that even though I couldn't understand before I saw it. You definitely will look at your life more positively and with gratitude. I am grateful for this film!!",1426636800,4,476,4.0638297872340425
8544205,5,B009T8HKYI,"Beautifully narrated through by many that have or are still dealing with loss and death.  Takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotion from start to finish by connecting and emphasizing a common fear that we all share.  Makes you realize, live life to the fullest, don't give the best of yourself to strangers all day and then take all of your frustrations out on your loved ones at the end of the day.  Be kind.  Be thankful.  Most importantly, we are all going to die, it's inevitable, so why not smile, love, laugh and dance with purpose while you're here.",1424390400,3,560,4.450980392156863
8544206,5,B009T8HKYI,"This film takes all the missing pieces that those of us experienced in the loss of some one
near and dear..  For sure..the empty feeling never goes away it stays with you and it should.

Sofia brings the true meaning and understanding of coping with a death through the eyes, voice and the
listening to folks that have suffered such deep pains as you feel at certain times and perhaps for no reason..
it just comes upon you..  It is a brilliant effort of taking the many feelings and capsulate in a form that is enlightening,
and leaves the viewer with an up lifted spirit and a wonderful understanding on how to deal with his or her;s
own personal loss..  It is a wonderful film to have in your library..when saddnes prevails or to loan to a friend
when words can not express a solution.. I lost my wife almost 4 years ago..but found her in how to relate
and accept such a loss..hard to explain..but I am sure many can understand..  A film for all ages that have to
experience a loss alone or with other loved ones...  Excellent viewing......",1399248000,4,1043,4.43455497382199
8544207,5,B009T8HKYI,I enjoyed this documentary.  My wife and I had a very stimulating conversation after watching it.  Our parents are elderly and so this topic has been on our mind.,1376438400,,162,4.551724137931035
