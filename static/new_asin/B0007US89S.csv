8051979,1,B0007US89S,Ok here we go. The first presenter somewhat skimmed the surface. The second presenter was performing a strait out hypnosis session. I was ticked because I am a professional hypnotist and I recognized it from the start. This was supposed to teach remote viewing not a flat out opportunity to get over on people by hypnotizing them without them knowing it. that was a bunch of B.S. that's why it didn't make sense to one of the reviewers here. The presenter wasn't giving a seminar on remote viewing he was hypnotizing the audience without telling them what a scam artist.,1255392000,4,570,4.71
8051980,2,B0007US89S,"Thre is some fairly good exercises in there, although a lot is left out. They claim that the government is no longer doing or contracting for remote viewers, which had me asking, ""How do these people know?"" RVing was prolly renamed as another project and most of the video seemed to lead to websites where you can pay for classes on this subject.

Seemed kinda hoaky to me.

They also claim you cannot RV numbers and names, although they were having this conference in Las Vegas, and told the audience, before a night of Keno playing, over and over that it doesn't work, it doesn't work for numbers, which is likely BS and the subjects followed suit according to the next day's speaker. They apparently failed miserably as they were told to do the day before, at Keno.

After watching, it seemed like they were trying to separate psychics and RV, which seems like a contradiction to me... aren't they one in the same?

About the only thing I got out of it was basic being aware of your self, your experiences, your environment, which just about any meditation can do for anyone.

By the end, I felt like just about all the speakers ther were trying to sell their classes, which when you look the websites they list on google, they are all connected.

If they really cared about getting this informatin out to the public, they'd have shown more technique and had RV testing involved, which only happened twice that I saw (I kept falling asleep while watching it, a it's incredibly boring.) One exercise included an exercise of who was going to sit in a certain chair in the room, which is kinda ridiculous, s who knows who else would or had sit/sat in that same chair.

The other exercise was pretty good (2nd spakere 1st disk.)He passed out pinecones, had the audience fell, smell, etc. and write out descriptive words, then ran through an RV exercise that was more of what I would expect from a video on the subject.

I rented this 3 DVD, 6-part set and was disappointed that I spent money to rent it, much less spent the money to buy it! IF I'd spent more than $10 or so to buy the set, I'd have been disappointed!

Nearly all, if not all, the information and exercises on these DVDs are available on-line for free, AND there is better information on-line for free as well as in books, etc.",1215993600,4,2292,4.490384615384615
8051981,3,B0007US89S,"This was a lecture series presented in Las Vegas, June 15-17 2001 w/only the use of an overhead. The camera mostly stayed on the speaker or the overhead. The quality of the sound could be better. The menu of the 3 disks was subdivided into chapters for both lectures of each disk.
Disk 1, 112 min total.
Vol 1: The first lecture w/Gabrelle was the history of RV (1960s pop culture & military use in USA & Soviet Union), describing RV, mental noise (distractions or being biased by outside influences or your own imagination), types of RV (it's not astral projection or out of body experiences), Why learn it? (helps you with day to day), examples of past sessions & 1 simple try of your own guessing what the picture she will use. She is a bit monotoned & boring (which she admits she is even with RV).
Vol 2: Has Patrick Marsolek describing action & receptive mode (left or right brain), a Princton Pyschologist, the importance of awareness (self explainitory), maintaining mental states (not that in depth)& states of consciousness. He also spoke slowly & the lecture plodded on & is a hypnotist also in Montana.
So far I haven't learn anything except the history of RV.
Disk 2, total of 131 min.
Vol 1: Pam Coronado does a 5 min picture tribute to Alan Vaughan, his many papers, pyschic studies & statistics on them, precognition & a min or 2 Q&A. She was more emotional about the tribute & better speaker, more earnest, the stitistics was interesting.
Vol 2: Dick Allgire talks about the importantance of location in RV (knowing where you are if blindfolded, target contact (finding people/things on maps), what is an 05-D?, great circle Azimuths (the scientific way to use points of origin to find fixed location), Velver examples. This was all about studies how well RVs found things such as people & landmarks. This is mostly how they use scientic data to do it which needs multiple people. Dick is a viewer himself & seems charming.
Disk 3, total of 121 min.
Vol 1: Lyn Buchanan (ret. army) talks about RV training (not your fault if you can't do it if someone jsut says ""go with it""), obstacles students encounter fear of failure), course materials, CRV method, rating the target. Lyn seems very down to earth, matter of fact & bored me the least.
Vol 2:  Paul Smith talks more about psychology & left/right brain how being pyschic is just being able to be consciously aware of more then the usual 1% the average person is consciously aware from sight, sound, etc. If we were aware of 100% of all of that, we'd never get anything done & have sensory overload, which he said was like agent orange. More about that the left brain tries to complete things, tries to assume what you see is so & so & is usually wrong. Sketching brings out the more acurate right brain that gets the extra info like a picture flashed a split second that you don't consioucly see. He also goes into how information can be tarnished by outside distractions & left brain.
The last DVD I think people would get the most out of as I stated what I remember most & learned most from the dvd.",1151107200,7,3071,4.5533453887884265
