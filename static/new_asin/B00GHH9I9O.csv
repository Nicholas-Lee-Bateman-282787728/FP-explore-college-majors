8623153,4,B00GHH9I9O,"This review is for Red Flag only as I have yet to see Rubberneck (but will).  Anyway, I really enjoyed Red Flag.  I would recommend this to fans of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Louie. It has that same clever, funny, neurotic and at times shallow tone and rhythm of those two TV drama/comedies.  This film more readily blurs the line of reality as Karpovsky seems to be playing a version of himself and I would bet the story has some basis in reality as well.

Karpovsky goes on a short road trip post breakup with his girlfriend to promote his indie film, Woodpecker (Karpovsky's real life 2nd feature film, also very good).  The problem is he's so down in the dumps from the breakup he can't bear the existential burden of the road alone and desperately recruits another shallow goofball friend to accompany him.  Eventually a female joins the duo and their situation unravels in a very funny and neurotic manner.",1465084800,,909,4.614906832298137
8623154,4,B00GHH9I9O,"Began watching in earnest, schmuck that I am, and quickly-very quickly- realized that I was being put on by something that was putting itself on. Too many real life chords struck to easily dismiss this film. Karpovsky manages to chronicle the woe of a shmo. Go with it and remember how many self-important people living in la-la land this reminds you of. No academy awards here but an entertaining watch. You could and, I'm sure, you have seen much worse. P.S. the acting is very, very good.",1399334400,,491,4.655172413793103
8623155,1,B00GHH9I9O,"Red Flag: No subtitles; poor audio level; no special features; marginally poor acting; was suppose to have some sub level of humor - I never even chuckled once; lots of credits overlapping the first five minutes of film to occupy film time. Conclusion: All an alert for cheap.
As a compassionate person I gave it fifteen minutes but like music there are a zillion singers out there trying to make it and if a singer screeches like a barn owl for the first minute - well, it's time to move on to someone else (i.e. another movie). But, as a truly compassionate person I gave it another 15 minutes - no improvement. But, as a truly compassionate foolish person I gave it a 3rd try with a ff towards the end - no better.
Plot: Someone's self documentary film on traveling about showing and selling another documentary about searching for an elusive woodpecker (i.e. searching for oneself, I think). He also has personal and girl friend issues which occupy the remainder of the movie.
I didn't bother with the other movie.",1394928000,,1018,4.629834254143646
