3419864,5,B0018S5MQ0,I'm glad I ordered this Complete Series of Hardcastle and McCormick. I have watched it and I love it. I watched this show when I was growing up as a small child on TV. Thanks Amazon.com for having this.,1251676800,10,202,4.205128205128205
3419865,5,B0018S5MQ0,"Hardcastle & Mccormick with Brian Keith & Daniel Hugh Kelly
was a Starsky & Hutch type show with action & humor with
well written stories & acting. Keith & Kelly have great
chemistry as a Judge trying to straighten out an x-con
by having him move in & solve some old cases that got
away from him in court. The theme song changed in the
2nd season to some lame happy type song but later was
changed back to the original ""drive' theme. I always
loved that song. I don't remember too many of these
as I never got to see them in reruns but they are
as great as I remember. This is a classic example of
how great TV was without all the CSI blood guts & sex
on tv today. If you like 70-80's type action tv shows
this is a great overlooked series. It should've lasted
more than 3 seasons but I'm glad it's finally out!",1247616000,79,811,4.075

3419969,5,B0018S5MQ0,"I don't do many reviews and this is the first on a TV show but ----I love this show!!  I had never watched it before and then seen a couple of episodes on the GET TV Channel and immediately went in search of the DVD set.  Why can't they make shows like this again?  TV from that era did not rely on sex, violence or special affects.
The acting, writing and directing are way above anything you see on TV or the big screen of today.

These 2 guys have chemistry, timing and you can tell they were having fun doing this show.  They did much adlibbing on their own----- and it works.
This has become my all time favorite show.

There are moments of brilliancy in this show and some of the most touching scenes I have ever watched.  Subtle and understated --- you may have to watch the episodes more than once to catch them all.

I binged watch the entire series and then went back and watched just the scenes between Brian Keith and Daniel Hugh Kelly several times.
I am still watching some of it over every day---yes it is that good.

I would also keep a pen and pad handy because there are words of wisdom that you will want to remember such as:
In the episode ""Ties My Father Sold Me"", Mark has tracked down his father who deserted him when he was 5.  His father has turned out not to be the father he had hoped to find.  Hardcastle tells Mark that he should at least give his father a chance and gives this little pearl of wisdom:
""The trouble is people always turn out the way they are instead of the way you want them to be.""

At the end of this episode after Mark's father runs off again--Hardcastle says ""Come on kid--I'll take you to a ball game.""  They walk off with Hardcastle pattling Mark on shoulder.  He is there even if the Mark's father is not.

In the episode ""Mr. Hardcastle Goes to Washington"" it is Mark's turn to dispense with some wisdom as Harcastle is trying to change himself and his image after he has been nominated for the Supreme Court.
Mark, in a scene showing his growing maturity and wisdom tells Harcastle  ""Be hones--not political.  Don't be so quick to turn in the pick up truck for a limo.  When you go to the biggest party of your life you dance with who brought.  Don't Change!""
There are so many moments and scenes in this series like these.

Brian Keith and Daniel Hugh Kelly are amazing actors.  They are so natural that you lose yourself in the watching.  You forget about time and surroundings and are just caught up in the story.
Much like reading a good book and at the ending you close the book and give a heavy sigh---saying to yourself--""WOW!  That was a good read.""
I say WOW!---This is a great show---from beginning to end.

In the episode ""Birthday Present Hardcastle is shot and has not been expected to live.  Mark in the mean time is forced to shoot and kill a crazy sociopath.  He comes to the hospital when Hardcastle regains consciousness.
Mark looks traumatized and crushed.  He looks shaken and pale. His eyes look as if he has had a hard cry---the kind of cry you hide in the shower to do.
I don't know how Daniel Hugh Kelly does this---IT LOOKS SO REAL.  After he sits down at the bedside  Mark kind of folds in on himself and confesses to the judge:
 ""I killed him----I killed a man judge.  It only took one bullet and a 10th of a second.
""I ain't never killed nobody before.
It feels bad---it feels real bad.  It's like I'm somehow worth less.""
This episode should have received an Emmy nomination---it is excellent from beginning to end.

As you progress through the series you begin to see the growing love and respect these two characters have for each other but are reluctant and uncomfortable showing----especially Hardcastle.
By the end of the series they have become closer than the blood ties other father and sons have.

Near the end of the series is another one of my favorite episodes called ""If You Could See What I See"".
The guest star is Rosemary Clooney---a top grade actress that was made for this part.  Mark has hired her as a maid.
She keeps having visions of Mark being shot and killed----and her visions always come true.
In one scene Mark is helping Millie with the dishes.
As they talk Millie asks ?Why do your feelings for hardcastle embarrass you Mark?
Mark  ""They don't---I just don't talk about them much.  That's all.""

At the end of the episode Millie is telling Mark how the judge sat by his side all night in the hospital----""Worse than an expectant father"" she says.  Then Millie leans over to whisper to Mark ""He loves you---  I had to watch this scene several times on slow motion to get that as it is of course not spoken out loud but just mouthed.
This show is a perfect show with a perfect ending.  It is the kind of show one wishes they could buy a copy of to give to everyone they know.

I have found out that there is a book written about this show and how it was created.  It includes episode reviews, interviews etc.  I have ordered the book but not received it yet.  It appears to be worth the purchase and is available on Amazon and you can read the intro to it.
It is titled: Hardcastle and McCormick by  Deb Ohlin (Author),  Cheri deFonteny  (Author),  Lynn Walker (Author)

I hope I have not gone on too long---it is hard to stop talking about this series as it has so many wonderful moments.",1466294400,4,5300,4.358163265306122

3419994,5,B0018S5MQ0,"I still remember watching Hardcastle and McCormick when the episodes first aired on TV.  Every time I saw the Coyote my jaw dropped wide open.  As an 11-year old this was the time when cars really started to have an influence on me and I remember drawing pictures of the car in class when I was supposed to be paying attention to the teacher.

I came across the complete series on DVD while searching around on Amazon and decided to buy it.  Now that I am in my 40's the coolness factor of the Coyote has dropped a couple notches but it still brings back fond memories of my childhood.  I watched the entire series and one thing that I didn't key in on as a youngster was the excellent chemistry between Brian Keith (Judge Hardcastle) and Daniel Hugh Kelly (""Skid"" Mark McCormick).  I have to say, those guys played very well off of each other and it was a complete joy to watch them together.  I went into the purchase fully anticipating a hefty dose of cheesy 80's TV plots but I am very happy to say that I totally enjoyed watching the entire series.

3420061,4,B0018S5MQ0,"Prolific Stephen J. Cannell has created some of the coolest shows of the 1980s: The A-Team, Riptide, Greatest American Hero, 21 Jump Street, Wise Guy...and Hardcastle & McCormick, one of my personal favorites. This show only lasted for three seasons (1983-1986, ABC), and 65 episodes. The premise, such as it was, was pretty one-note. But it was fun while it lasted, thanks to the odd couple rapport between Brian Keith and Daniel Hugh-Kelly.

Judge Milton C. ""Hardcase"" Hardcastle (Brian Keith) may have just newly retired from the Los Angeles Superior Court, but he still plans to keep on imposing his own brand of justice. In his career on the bench, he's had to dismiss 200 cases and let the criminals go on legal technicalities; now, he means to hound them until they slip up and then send them to the hoosegow. He recruits the breezy but incarcerated Mark ""Skid"" McCormick (Daniel Hugh-Kelly) to help him in his personal crusade and gets him paroled into his custody. But McCormick finds out quickly that Hardcastle isn't the easiest guy to work for. The old judge is contrary, foul-tempered, and eccentric, and his aggresive, take-no-prisoners attitude takes some getting used to. Part of the fun of the show lies in McCormick constantly trying to sneak away from his lockdown at the judge's Malibu estate to get some alone time and engage in some personal fun.

I'm not gonna mince words - Hardcastle & McCormick is a decent but ho-hum series. The weekly storylines weren't fodder for the water cooler. In fact, I barely recall the episodes. What I do remember fondly is the ornery interplay, the constant tug-of-war and banter and bickering, between the two leads. That was what I looked forward to every week way back when. It was totally natural that the initial boss-employee association between the two would develop into, first, a mentor-student partnership and then blossom into a father-son relationship. The law-enforcing aspects of the show and even the relentless number of car chases certainly took a back seat in terms of importance and my personal preference.

A thing that stands out to me with regards to 1980s TV shows was the outstanding cars that were showcased in their respective series. Two particularly memorable vehicles were Knight Rider's KITT - a Pontiac Trans Am - and The Dukes of Hazzard's General Lee - a Dodge Charger. And then there was the awesome red-hued Coyote, a hybrid Manta Montage, that was driven by McCormick. I was a kid in the '80s, and I actually had earnest debates with my buddies as to which car, of the three, would outrace which (it was never really decided).

Brian Keith has been gone from us for many years now and Daniel Hugh-Kelly has had his day in the sun. Now, Hugh-Kelly toils, more or less anonymously, in television cameos and supporting guest roles. But, to me, whenever their names surface, I inevitably think of the series where I knew them best, this one. 3.5 out of 5 stars (mostly on the strength of the duo's sparkling buddy chemistry) and a solid recommendation for Hardcastle & McCormick.",1422230400,3,3067,4.858508604206501

3420074,4,B0018S5MQ0,"I really love this series and give the show itself five stars overall, but the DVDs themselves are really subpar. You get all the episodes, yes, but the episodes look like they scanned the VHS version and copied it to DVD. I know not every show can be remastered to HD quality, but some sort of enhancement would help these movies look a little better on modern televisions. And the audio is only 2.1. Once again, I know you can't work miracles with some older television shows, but combined with the video quality it makes the show look really dated at some points.

I know it sounds like I am doing a lot of complaining and you probably came her for a review of the actual series. Well, the series is really, really, good. Quick overview, McCormick is paroled to Judge Hardcastle, and they solve crimes together. It's kind of like Knight Rider meets Magnum P.I. with a dash of the Odd Couple thrown in. Good humor and fun car chases in every episode. If they ever make the effort to put it out on BluRay, I'll buy it again!",1417910400,7,1025,4.394736842105263

Watch the show car change into a stunt car, the wheels are different. the second season they changed the song then back used first season stunts and Mark's B&E. The car that's going to wreck has roll bar. It's great. The car got doors and an auto in second season. The list goes on. The things they got away with.

3420130,5,B0018S5MQ0,"I was able to see the entire series in one week--all 65 episodes and it was the BEST!  Starting from the beginning right through to the end, I could see very well how their friendship evolved.  The show was action-packed.  Brian Keith gave his all and did a lot for a man his age. Daniel Hugh Kelly kept up with Keith every step of the way and his love of life combined with Keith's 'gruffness' was infectious.  You've got to make sure you watch ""In the Eye of the Beholder"", episode 62/63--hilarious and written & directed by Mr. Kelly...I too absolutely loved the last episode where they are stuck in jail (again) and tell each other how they really feel about the other, plain and simple.  It's because of this show that I've become interested in Brian's and Daniel's other movie & TV roles.

Stephen Cannell, Brian Keith, Daniel Hugh Kelly, and all the others did a wonderful job with this show.  The humor was outstanding, the friendship that (on the show, don't know if it was the same personally for them) grew out of this series was so believable.  I loved the Coyote blowing up scene, the humor of that episode.  The ending (last episode) was fantastic (John Ashton from Hardball, a 1989 tv show that I also enjoyed so much, was in this episode) ...I think I'm talking myself into watching it again!  Why, oh why, did they have to put an end to this show?!?! It had its serious moments and then here comes the humor again, I love it!

3420146,4,B0018S5MQ0,"This show was a favorite of mine during childhood. Aside from the content of the show, which is true to 80's form, the DVD quality was acceptable. In several scenes, (especially conversations in moving vehicles), video pixelation can be seen in the fast moving exterior window shots. I am not sure if it is totally consistent with how the show actually ran, but the opening theme song changes at least 4 times during the first two seasons in the middle of the seasons. One case even had the same song performed by two separate artists. One was great and the other wasn't (musically speaking). You'll see shots reused from previous episodes (A Cannell signature [just watch any two episodes of Greatest American Hero]) and including the car. The coyote changes from the awesome version (season 1) to the square version (season's 2-3) but you will notice they interchange them frequently in stunt shots and distant angles. You even see sloppy editing such as an entire scene with the whole crew reflected in a glass window, plus a second coyote in the background parking lot in front of the detail shot of the first coyote. Be sure to pick out plenty of guest stars who made it later in their careers like Joe Pantoliano, Johnathan Banks (Mike from Breaking Bad) is a reoccuring bad guy, Beau Starr, Lance Henrickson, Dennis Franz, David Graf and more.",1352419200,6,1350,4.773504273504273

The stunt work may be a little dated and maybe a little overdone but I don't really care about that, I enjoy them anyway. Only one thing though...I didn't think the pilot episode was as good as the rest of the series. In general I thought the show and the stories got better as the series went on. Even the second episode I thought was much better than the first.

The view is sometimes very gritty looking.  Also the stunts - well they are old too.  I love that he likes the series and is pacing himself only watching one a week.  I have a hard time watching them as I want to laugh at the stunts and ""blips - goofs"" that you would not see in todays TV shows.  The quality of taping is what it was for that time period; as long as you are aware of this you will not be disappointed in what you are getting.

And all these years later, I still love it:) I hadn't seen an episode since it went off the air back in 86, and watching it now brings back a flood of memories. I feel 12 again, and that car is just the icing on the cake. The box set was great and nicely priced. The only problem I have, and its probably just me because I'm just picky, is I wished they couldve added some bonus material, like bloopers (they are always a fave for me), interviews (hey I know Brian Keith is dead now), behind the scenes, ya name it. I know you probably think I'm just a little too picky, but that wouldve been the best. Overall I'm fully satisfied and truly love H&M :)",1302825600,6,745,3.973333333333333

This series was my favorite and I was lucky to watch it as a kid in Cyprus. It is a reminder how the old times used to be...much simpler and much more honest than today! Simply, the world was a better place back then!

I really love those guys! Their chemistry is unbelievable!
I found myself urging to see the next episode, each time the previous one was ending!
This Complete Series Is A-Must-Have!

Now, the collection as a material, is in an excellent condition. The DVD s are brand new and there is a plastic seal that covers the whole collection.

But, in my opinion, the most important thing of all is that the episodes inside are in an excellent video quality, and there are NO ADVERTISEMENTS anywhere in the collection! (I am saying this because I bought the series earlier from another website, but the condition of that collection was very poor and with a lot of advertisements inside the episodes!)

I hope I have contributed to your decision. This is my honest truth.

Enjoy those 2 guys again!
