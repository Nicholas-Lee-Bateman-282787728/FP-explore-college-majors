8385990,4,B0030Q28NI,"There are other offerings for the ten old 'Sherlock Holmes' movies.
So too the Thirty-Nine episodes from a television series around 1954.
These have Ronald Howard as 'Holmes' and are often inspired by the original stories.

The one big advantage of this product is the fifty radio shows from the 1940's when people listened to the radio and television was an idea for the future (altho Great Britain and Germany both had television broadcasts before WW II).",1436745600,,457,4.935064935064935
8385991,5,B0030Q28NI,"Good old fashioned fun! Being an avid sherlock holmes fan (basil rathbone as my favorite SH actor) I was pleasantly surprised to see this all in one DVD set available. This is the only dvd set that I have seen that includes THIS MANY FILMS IN ONE BOX! ELEVEN DVDS!! I own quite a few of these classic movies separately, however this definitely completes my collection having them all in this one set. Being so old, the transfers are pretty decent, very watchable as me and my husband plan to have a sherlock holmes mystery marathon! Having 10 full length theatrical films plus the ENTIRE 39 TV episodes of ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" with Ronald Howard is definitely a plus. The bonus audio cd that comes with this collection is great for me as I have to commute to work (30 minutes everyday) and there are over 50 radio episodes that I can listen to on the way to work. Each radio episode is around 25-30 minutes long which is about my exact travel time so it works out great.

The film listing isn't clear from the description so I've put together the list here:

Dressed to Kill - Starring Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes
Terror by Night - Starring Basil Rathbone as Sherlock HolmesThe Woman in Green - Starring Basil Rathbone as Sherlock HolmesSherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon - Starring Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes

I GIVE THIS  5 STARS FOR HAVING SO MANY FILMS IN ONE DVD SET!!!

The only thing I wish it had was some kind of booklet to go along with it that listed all the details/trivia/facts about each of the films and actors.
Maybe they will read this and decide to add something like that in the future!",1260921600,3,3693,4.526799387442573
