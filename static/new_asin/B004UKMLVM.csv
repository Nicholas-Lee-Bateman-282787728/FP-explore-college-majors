8441633,5,B004UKMLVM,"I first saw this series on YouTube and love it so much I purchased it from Amazon.  Even though it is for region 2 and I cannot watch it on my DVD player, I can watch it on my laptop.

Neal Oliver continues the story from his first 10 part series of the ""History of Scotland"" with this 4 part series going back 2000 years to tell the story of the earliest beginnings of Britain before the Romans during the Bronze Age through the Iron Age during the Roman occupation.  Five Star viewing.

8441634,5,B004UKMLVM,"My family and I are watching this now. I am enjoying it a lot. There are some things I would change though. I think there is more to say about the Bronze age, but it is over in the length of one DVD. I admit, I have a preference for this era, so was hoping to see this explored more deeply, especially the little known sites and life of this time period.",1413244800,,354,3.9305555555555554
