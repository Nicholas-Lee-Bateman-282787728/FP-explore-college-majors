3451832,4,B001AIRUOK,"In the debut film by Joachim Trier, childhood friends Erik and Phillip (Espen Klouman-Hiner and Anders Danielsen Lie) embark on a life as novelists. They send their first novel out on the same day. Only Phillip's is published. Then Phillip meets Kari and his art seems like shallow inspiration compared to his passion for his girlfriend. For reasons which aren't made clear in the film, (a head injury from a car accident, passion, the pressure of fame?) Phillip has a nervous breakdown and enters a mental institution.

When Phillip leaves the mental institution, Erik gets his book published while keeping a careful eye on Phillip. Phillip realizes he isn't the artist he thought he was. He has no desire to write and feels that his first success was a good regurgatation of a writer hero he and Erik both admire. He hints that he believes Erik's novel may be the same. Erik isn't willing to accept this and decides to leave behind the negative influences on his life in Oslo. Phillip reenters the mental institution-probably for good. Phillip is destroyed by the fact that his dreams were disappointing and Erik embarks on another course-reaffirming his life ambition by continuing to write.

Gorgeously filmed, good acting and a stimulating script. Avoids all cliche and pretension and is very original. It may be a bit artsy and slow for some. Don't expect fireworks. But if you find the themes I mentioned interesting, you'll find some redemption in Reprise.",1225238400,6,1464,4.9471544715447155
3451833,4,B001AIRUOK,"i really enjoyed this movie on several levels; the editing, acting, and gorgeous lighting are just a few of the positive aspects of this film. for example, i was not surprised that the director and cinematographer are big fans of of vermeer and john singer sargent. some of the individual shots in this film are set-up in just those styles. stunning. but, i would not recommend this film for everyone. this film draws on many film styles (french 'new wave' for one) that may confuse or seem 'artsy' to some viewers. this first time director i believe is very gifted and this is an excellent debut work. he has done his homework and created a beautiful work of art. if you are a patient viewer and have a bit of an artistic eye i'm confident you will enjoy this film. oh yeah, this film is funny! it took me a while to understand this. kind of you know when some of us americans don't get british humor? well, humor from norway is kind of like that. by the 2nd half of the film, i 'got it' a little more and let out some hearty chuckles. having said that, there are some serious downer themes in this film. and, that's the reason i ended-up taking half a star off my review. the film seems a bit confused about what it's message is. still, i highly recommend this film for the right type of viewer.",1224892800,2,1297,4.341563786008231
3451834,3,B001AIRUOK,"Two young writers, good friends, are headed on different trajectories.  One (Phillip) gets published first, but later (for reasons murky) has a nervous breakdown.  The other (Erik) one seems more screwed on and publishes later.  They faces professional challenges, the problems of relationships and personal demons.  Viktoria Winge is fetching as Kari,
the girlfriend of Phillip.

REPRISE has at times the feel of a documentary.  It is a ""different"" kind of movie and only by viewing it yourself will that make sense.
The soundtrack is Norwegian punk rock, not bad, especially the catchy tune, ""Finger-F--d by the Prime Minister.""",1220745600,3,630,5.313131313131313

8277717,4,B001AIRUOK,"The other day I saw ""Kissed by Winter"", an intruiging 2008 movie out of Norway, and here I am again writing about another great Norwegian movie. I actually saw this movie when it came out in the US in 2008, and when I saw it at my local library the other day, I couldn't resist picking it up.

""Reprise"" (107 min.; originally released in Norway in 2006, eventually released in the US in 2008) brings the story of two friends in their early 20s, Erik and Phillip, both of which are dreaming to become a successful writer. They both submit a book, hoping for publication. Phillip's book becomes an immediate smash, while Erik's is rejected. Phillip meets the girl of his dreams, but then things go awry, big time. He is eventually committed to a hospital ward. Meanwhile Erik keeps struggling to get his next book published. There are many additional sub-plots that I'm skipping, but I don't want to give away much further of the plot, you'll just have to see it for yourself how it all plays out. The movie focuses on love, friendship, professional and emotional struggles, and it plays out beautifully.

In all, even when watching this for the second time, I was entertained, entralled by the performances and the overall direction of the movie. This is so far removed from ""mainstream Hollywood"" and that is a compliment. Do we really need Pirates of the Caribbean 4 or yet another reboot of the Superman/Batman/fill-in-your-superhero franchise of movies?",1304294400,2,1456,4.796812749003984

8277720,4,B001AIRUOK,"The Norwegian drama, ""Reprise,"" is the first feature-length work by Danish-born director Joachim Trier - a premier effort that bodes great things for his future as a filmmaker.  He is clearly alive to the possibilities of the medium, as reflected in the original, highly idiosyncratic style he brings to the film.  Trier deftly employs many of the tools of the filmmaker's trade - narration, flashbacks, flash forwards, near-subliminal quick cuts to show imagined events, etc. - to convey his story.  Yet, rare for a newcomer, Trier never indulges in any of these ""tricks"" for their own sweet sake or to call attention to his own ingenuity; they are always placed at the service of the material, never the other way around.
.
Best friends from childhood, Erik and Phillip share the hope of one day becoming writers whose works will go beyond the merely commercial to challenge the status quo - thereby earning them the coveted status of ""cult"" authors.  As it turns out, Phillip's novel is published, but Erik's is not, yet Phillip winds up paying a price for his success, namely an emotional breakdown that has Erik performing a near-round-the-clock suicide-prevention watch on his friend.  Meanwhile, Erik continues on with his writing, experiencing success and disappointment - both professional and personal - along the way.

Erik and Phillip are both extremely complex characters, and Trier provides no penny-ante analysis to make them more easily understandable for the audience.  Sometimes it's hard to tell what exactly it is that is bothering the two, except that, in Philip's case at least, it might be actual mental illness that lies at the root of his problem.  Like many creative types, Erik and Phillip seem incapable of not over-analyzing and over-intellectualizing every single aspect of their lives, often resulting in a chronic dissatisfaction with themselves and the world around them.  As writers, they become obsessed with trying to convey every single nuance of life through language, and when they fail at that endeavor - as they inevitably do - the only viable option left for them seems to be either depression or madness.  As a consequence of all this, their relationships with women don't work out - and even their own longtime friendship threatens to come apart at the seams the deeper they go into brutal self-awareness.

As Erik and Phillip, Espen Klouman-Hoiner and Anders Danielsen Lie give supple, sensitive performances, as does Viktoria Winge as Phillip's on-again/off-again love interest.  The screenplay is rich in texture and sophisticated in theme, while the filmmaking itself sparkles with bold creativity and unfettered imagination.

As touching as it is thought-provoking, ""Reprise"" is a remarkably accomplished and assured piece of filmmaking - especially coming from a first timer.",1232150400,11,2825,5.2234513274336285
8277721,5,B001AIRUOK,"To anyone reading this: Congratulations, you have made a great discovery with this little piece of Norwegian cinema. Reprise is a film that successfully combines poignant drama with entertaining storytelling. Ostensibly, this is a film about two young writers negotiating social lives, literary ambitions and their friendship. On a deeper level, it's a story that delves into what it means to realize that one cannot live well through just writing, listening to unique music, and avoiding clichs. Along the way, there are moments that are funny, moments that are sad, and moments that are inspiring.

On the technical side, the film is endlessly surprising. According to those in the know, it's filmed in what is called the ""French New Wave"" style. I have no idea what that means, but from Reprise, I can assume that it is like crossing Run Lola Run with Snatch. Trier does it well and keeps the film from ever feeling very superficial.

Admittedly, young male viewers might identify more with Erik and Philip (and the immature lives they lead with their friends), but this shouldn't stop anyone from checking the film out. There is a story here for everyone about expectations and reality, friendship and ambition. In my opinion, Reprise is one of the most fascinating films of the last decade and one that certainly deserves more than just one thoughtful viewing.",1231804800,5,1365,5.008810572687224

A story developed during a decade significantly assures that although English-speaking market provides better commercial opportunities for selling books, much more number of small folks is to be interested in their languages and modern literature local trends.",1231027200,,473,5.955882352941177
8277723,4,B001AIRUOK,"Joachim Trier won a Best Director award from the Czech Republic's oldest film festival (since 1946), Karlovy Vary International Film Festiva.  The film won the Discovery Award from the Toronto Film Festival.  The story is quite gripping & brings you into the lives, hopes and disappointments of the characters.  Blond Espen Klouman-Hoiner plays Erik whose novel is at first not successful.  His good looks, nervous energy, flashing a smile that quickly fades make for an edgy performance.  His best friend is Phillip.  Played well by Anders Danielsen Lie, they send off their novels on the same day.  As Phillip, Lie experiences initial success & then sinks into depression, writers block and pursues an existentialist questioning on the value of life.  After being institutionalized, he loses his desire to write.  Meanwhile, Erik rewrites and resubmits his book to great acclaim.  Both men idolize established reclusive writer Sten Egil Dahl played by the taciturn Sigmund Severud.  Erik connects with him and is affected by his idol's suicide.  At first, I wondered if the pals were more than friends.  They hang out with their buddies such as the egoistic Lars played by Christian Rubeck and the earthy Geir played by Pal Stokka.  Then we see that Phillip has had an obsessive romance with the lovely Kari played by Viktoria Winge.  This leads him to an apparent suicide attempt and close scrutiny by Erik and Phillip's mother.  Erik meanwhile has a superficial relationship with Lillian that he can't find a way to break off.  Silje Hagen plays Lillian, who eventually boots Erik, much to his puzzlement & relief.  Both men seem to find their way through life, not overly happy, but with enough satisfaction in accomplishment.  This is a special story with emotional depth and strong performances from fresh faces.  Enjoy!",1227657600,2,1827,5.087542087542087
