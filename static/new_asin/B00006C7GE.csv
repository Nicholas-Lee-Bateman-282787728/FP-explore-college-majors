1741587,5,B00006C7GE,All shine in this wonderful to watch series. I enjoyed this more than just about any of the British period dramas I have seen. Loved especially Ian Bannen.,1231459200,7,155,4.571428571428571
1741588,5,B00006C7GE,A great series with truly wonderful actors -- what woman could resist developing a huge crush on Ian Bannen?  Episodes are good stories of an earlier time in a small Scottish village -- I have really enjoyed the whole series!,1221350400,4,225,4.625
1741589,5,B00006C7GE,"I enjoyed this series immensely. The evocation of the period after WW2 and the poverty endured by the working classes in Britain is powerfully drawn. The characters are beautifully played by an ensemble of actors/actresses ,experienced in  playing people from all walks of life. David Rintoul,Annette Crosbie and the late Ian Bannen are all fine actors and bring to this wonderful series an authentic feel that truly evokes that post-war period and the attitudes that prevailed at the time. I suppose in a way I harbour a deep nostalgia for that period and the cosy rural community in which it is set;the values of honesty,kindness and altruism seem quaint today,but as portayed here through the eyes of a doctor they represent a world where material gain was not the motivation for putting the well being of others before one's own.i;m looking forward to series 3 and possibly,if it's available,the original series made in the sixties. Perhaps if anyone out there has knowledge of this earlier Doctor Finlays Casebook they could let me know.",1185753600,10,1042,5.023121387283237
1741590,4,B00006C7GE,"I purchased this for my wife, who enjoys English programs from the 70's when we lived there.

She is quite pleased with the CD.

An aside, the National Health scheme in the UK as with all others, is a disaster.  If you want good care on a timely basis you must go private.",1174435200,8,272,4.09433962264151
1741591,5,B00006C7GE,"This series ranks well with those productions--Hope and Glory, All Creatures Great and Small--which depict a changed and changing British society during and after WWII.  The stories focus movingly on how the war affected individuals within virtually every class of society from the very poor to the upper levels, from the indigent (and the dropouts) to the professionals.  The principal actors (David Rintoul, Jason Flemyng, Annette Crosbie and the now late Ian Bannon) are beyond praise, as are the scripts by a whole series of writers.  And the sound, the photography and the editing are truly wondrous, as are the lush orchestrations of the Scottish National Symphony.  This is a superb series, the kind one wishes would never end.",1043020800,49,734,5.142857142857143
1741592,5,B00006C7GE,"The Dr. Finlay series was filmed in Auchtermuchty Scotland and stars David Rintoul the fellow who played ""Darcy"" in the BBC version of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE shot in the 1980s. You may also recall Rintoul from the FIVE RED HERRINGS, a Peter Wimsey tale also dramatized by the BBC. In addition to Rintoul, the cast includes Annette Crosbie and Ian Bannon(??) the recently deceased actor who played the lead in WAKING NED DEVINE.
The series begins as Dr. Finlay returns to his hometown following a stint in the Royal Army Medical Corps during WWII. Finlay arrives just in time to discover his long-time girl friend and ex-fiance involved with an America GI who is about to ship out to the States and wants to take her home as his bride.
Finlay's village has changed dramatically while he was away, and he soon discovers life is just as turbulent in his home town after the war, as it was at his last posting. For one thing, the village has acquired many new inhabitants. In addition to U.S. Army personnel, who are in the process of demobilizing, a collection of German War Prisoners lives in nearby ex-prison encampment. Seems no one has an interest in them any longer, but they still need medical care.
Finlay's private medical practice is about to become part of the National Medical Service, his old friend and partner is about to retire, and a new young doctor has arrived to begin his practice -- literally. On top of everything else, the long-time spinster housekeeper, who has kept everything organized for ages, is about to become a married woman and leave housekeeping permanently.
In some ways, the characterization of three doctors in a small Scotish village in the 1940s is very reminscient of the series ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL where three bachelor veternarians have set up practice in Yorkshire. However, Dr. Finlay was a Masterpiece Theater production based on the book by A.J.Cronin, whom I seem to recall was a Scottish physician himself and probably the basis for the story, just as the CREATURES series about James Herriot was based on a real vet's life in Yorkshire.
This is a great series that depicts life in Scotland more than 50 years ago in a world that has since disappeared. I absolutely loved the stories, and David Rintoul is to die for. If you liked him as Darcy, you will love him as Dr. Finlay. Also, I think this series was BETTER than the CREATURES stories--this from a five star fan of Herriot's tales.",1035417600,88,2439,4.727699530516432

1741604,1,B00006C7GE,"This series was very disappointing, somewhat slow, the doctor is pompous/grumpy, rather dark and dreary.........and if you have Christian values you will not appreciate portions of the doctors life and philosophy.",1411171200,2,213,5.903225806451613
1741605,5,B00006C7GE,"I wish I could give this 10 stars.  When I purchased this,  I didn't know what to expect.  I  purchased it based on the reviews and because I enjoy the work of Rintoul, Crosbie, and Bannen.  It is an understated and brilliant series.  Too bad the quality of the images could not be adjusted better, but still a great work not to be missed if you enjoy intelligently produced work.",1410825600,4,380,4.357142857142857

1741608,5,B00006C7GE,I recall the pop song about Doctor Finlay made popular by Scottish Singer Andy Stewart.  I also watched the television broadcast.  The interaction between the older doctor Cameron who had worked most of his professional life under the old Healthcare Saving Program and the then new National Health Care System the NHS as it came to be known.,1402185600,,341,4.862068965517241

1741610,5,B00006C7GE,"I love this series and have watched it several times.  This time I looked on IMDB for information and found out that the last story in the series is NOT included on the boxed set.  Does anyone know why?  However, it is still one of the best especially the stuggles after WWII in Scotland (actually all of UK) at getting the National Health Service set up and running.",1351641600,4,367,4.367647058823529
1741611,5,B00006C7GE,Another great drama from the BBC.  I am sure we will be adding other episodes to complete our collection.  It is a shame that US television cannot match the British in quality dramatic productions like this.,1243555200,3,207,4.722222222222222

7967022,1,B00006C7GE,"This series is a stiff, poorly acted display of bad writing. It's worse than a cheap romance novel. The characters are not believable and the storylines just quit when the episode time limit has been reached, whether the story is concluded or not. I've seen better acting at high school plays. The old doctor smiles at weird times, making him appear more creepy than kindly. The stories seem disconnected, as though they were written by several different people who had never watched the show or read any of the other scripts.",1520380800,,526,4.791208791208791
