5966089,4,B00F3KJSEG,"My 10 month old had absolutely loved the twinkle twinkle song on YouTube so I bought this because of that, but there is nothing else of that fantastic calibre on this DVD. Saying that, she does still really enjoy it when we sing some of the other songs together---- and I find that I can't stop singing some of them myself throughout the day.",1384992000,,342,4.359375
5966090,5,B00F3KJSEG,We were familiar with Super Simple songs from watching some of the video's on YouTube. My daughter was so excited when I first let her watch this video. And even after owning the video for months she still ask to watch it. Worth every penny.,1384732800,5,241,4.377777777777778
5966091,5,B00F3KJSEG,"This DVD is just like the Youtube videos my child goes crazy over.  The audio and video are exactly the same, and best yet, you don't need a data connection!  The videos are not in the same order as Youtube has them, but the content is the same.  This DVD proved to be extremely useful on a past road trip, keeping my kid occupied for most of the trip.  The DVD's of volumes 1 and 2 were not available a few months ago, so I went ahead and bought both while I could.",1483228800,,466,3.978494623655914

5966093,5,B00F3KJSEG,"We came across this collection on YouTube. Our almost 2 year old does not care for tv and videos but on a rough overnight we googled ""lullaby"" and he was thrilled. It calmed him right down and watched intently.
Since we lack home internet this was the alternative. We went ahead and purchsed both 1 & 2. The first DVD doesn't seem to capture his interest as much but he loves the 2nd DVD. Would have been nice to be able to buy in a set and I would have done if it was an option.
The DVD lasts around 35 minutes and there is an option to repeat play which I like. Unlike some other children's DVDs this does not contain 20 minutes of unskippable advertisements. Pop it in, load it up and click to go.
The videos are a few minutes each and have basic visuals.
 I would buy them for a friends child.",1481241600,,797,4.108974358974359

5966110,1,B00F3KJSEG,The only reason I bought this garbage is because my son really enjoys watching this on YouTube at home so I wanted to get it for the DVD player for the car. First off I didn't realize 33 minutes for 15 bucks so just about 50 cents a minute. Plus it's nothing like the YouTube videos. Yes maybe a couple of them are like the YouTube video but  the rest are very poor basic animation or some creepy John McEnroe wannabe looking guy singing the songs. Very bad purchase on my part.,1463184000,3,478,4.195652173913044

5966114,5,B00F3KJSEG,I purchased this for my nephew as he absolutely LOVES the Twinkle Twinkle Little Star video. We would play it over and over again for him on YouTube and he never tired of it. He really seems to love all the videos on this DVD,1459900800,,225,4.022222222222222
5966115,2,B00F3KJSEG,"If you're going to by this dvd, please be aware of the fact that half of the videos on here are not the same ones they play on youtube. Some are the actual youtube versions, but the other half of them are of some weird guy singing the songs in what looks like home made videos with puppets. It is extremely weird and a waste of money. I bought this expecting it to be the same thing we watch on youtubre, not some strange man ruining half the songs, i really don't get why they did this. Makes no sense. Look up their other dvd called Super Simple Songs Volume 2 (the cover is green). That one is same price with same amount of songs but has all the youtube versions!",1458604800,5,667,4.099236641221374

5966144,5,B00F3KJSEG,"I have an 18 month old and she doesn't really like TV.  She LOVES Mickey Mouse and even that show she will watch for about 2 minutes.  I have noticed she really likes music, especially nursery rhymes and kids songs so I decided to look for a DVD that had animated songs.  I came across these Super Simple Song DVDs and though I would give them a try.  Oh my word, she is obsessed with these DVDs!!  We only let her watch them in the morning and before bed, but she can't get enough.  She will sit and watch this whole DVD and be upset when we turn it off.  It is crazy to me because she has such little interest in any other cartoon or TV shows.  The best part is these DVDs teach her  a lot of things.  She is recognizing colors, letters, and numbers.  She even says things like A B C D or 6 7 8 9.  It is so amazing.  She will also play a long with the songs.  On the BINGO song if they say clap your hands or tap your tummy, she is right there doing it.  I am so impressed with the quality of these discs and how perfect they are for a toddler.  It isn't just my daughter, when other kids who have been over have seen the DVDs they are glued to them as well.  Can't recommend them enough.  We only have Volume 1 and Volume 2 right now but both are awesome!",1435708800,8,1259,3.909090909090909

5966200,2,B00F3KJSEG,I bought this dvd because i had seen twinkle twinkle star on u tube and my son adored it. So when i saw that the there was a dvd with other songs i thought it was decent. The accompanying songs are just terrible. Most of the songs are just a poorly presented puppet show that failed to capture my child's attention for a minute. If you are buying just for twinkle twinkle little star video and you think its worth th 15$ then its ok.,1403827200,4,433,4.105882352941176
5966201,5,B00F3KJSEG,"In essence I grew up with Sesame Street and the Sesame street compilation DVDs have not been as good as the televised series as such I wanted something equally as fun and engaging for my 9 month old son and whilst trawling a exhaustive number of kids songs on Youtube the ones that kept hitting the mark teaching him to clap, making him laugh were super simple songs.
Now having bought volume one, I've noticed some of the songs which he likes are not on the DVD and as such my question is when is volume 2 going to be released ? Very soon I hope.",1403568000,,547,4.169811320754717

5966219,2,B00F3KJSEG,"I feel bad for writing this review because my kid loves the ""Twinkle Little Star"" animated song. In my opinion, this DVD is way over priced for what is on it . (my son is just not interested in ANY of the other videos ) My advice for what it's worth: If you are buying this because you loved their  ""Twinkle Little Star"", do some research.  I haven't paid this much for a DVD ever, but I purchased it thinking it would be high quality and have some new material. I could have just continued to watch on YouTube, no surprises on this product at all.",1387843200,3,548,4.160377358490566
