A rough promise carefully sifted from the human sands; separated; graded; properly dopped; beautifully faceted, polished and set.
It is one of the most psychologically brutal pieces ever filmed. Its immediate after-taste left me ashamed of my culture, gender and biological family. This gustatory sensation lingers still, after one viewing and the lapse of some 36+ years.",1243209600,,479,5.153846153846154

3076576,3,B00124SNJS,"Despite the term ""heartwarming"" in the descriptive copy on the back of the ""Country Matters"" DVD case, most of the episodes are reminiscent of Thomas Hardy.  They are slow, brooding, and mostly focus on rural life as it really was for the poorer classes:  Isolated locations; dark, dirty cottages; bare economic survival; few acquaintances; poor verbal communication; and extremely limited options in life. In most episodes, the central character is offered one chance at a better life, usually economic improvement and/or love and/or escape from a bad family. And usually, fails to get it due to either poor choices or bad luck, and then is made to realize how dreary things will be for the rest of his or her life. It's a good series, but don't watch more than one or two episodes in an evening if you want cheerful dreams.

The rural locations are beautiful, the costumes are pretty good, the acting is excellent, in short the production values of this series are high.  Except--and it's a big except--for the music. British folk music would have accented the series extremely well. Instead, the music for every single episode consists of a little-varied, much-repeated, rinky-dinky, incongruously upbeat, rather electronic tune which, if memory serves, is also the theme for the BBC ""Lovejoy"" detective series.  If BBC couldn't shell out enough for decent music at the time the series was filmed, they ought to have done it before issuing this DVD.",1220918400,,1452,5.008298755186722
3076577,1,B00124SNJS,"I almost never stop watching something I have started no matter how much I dislike it.  I abandoned this steaming pile after 90 of the most painful minutes of my life.  My partner was lucky:  He lost consciousness halfway through the first story.

The first story features Ian McKellen as an art teacher who is courting three young women all at the same time.  Each of the woman is more vapid and uninteresting than the next.  The plot was that the art teacher was the most interested in the woman who was the least interested in him.  This was one of the most tedious hours I have ever spent watching anything.

I decided to watch the second story hoping things would get beter.  Foolish, foolish, foolish.  The second story was about an ignorant dolt of a girl whose doltish parents seemed to have little interest in her.  She was sent to work for a man and a woman.  The woman was an invalid.  The man took sexual advantage of the girl.  The girl didn't seem to care.  At this point I didn't care either so I gave up.

The characters in both episodes were of no interest at all, and the pacing of the stories was deadly.  I can't imagine any one deriving any kind of enjoyment from watching these.

8243882,2,B00124SNJS,"The chipper, cheery little theme song for ""Country Matters"" belies the themes of these depressing and slow moving stories. Each seems to focus on a stereotypical country bumpkin type of low intellect, who is exploited or ill used. I find it so frustrating to watch films which seem to have been filmed without benefit of lighting. I know cottages were dark inside, but I still like to see what's going on. After all, we aren't living at the turn of the century. The only element I found interesting was seeing  many British stars still acting todayin roles as very young actors in 1972.",1523232000,,586,4.689320388349515

8243886,5,B00124SNJS,"These dramatizations of short stories by British writers A. E. Coppard and H. E. Bates, dealing with love affairs set in the English countryside just after WW I, display excellent direction, meticulous and convincing period setting, and an almost astonishingly high level of acting in every role, major and minor, from beginning to end. Their view of life is a tragically bleak one -- don't come to them for the sort of heartwarming family stories you might have been prepared for by something like Lark Rise to Candleford -- but they do have what I consider the mark of great cinema: their impact on you is almost more like something in real life. The series abounds in the sort of unforgettable moments that great film can leave you with: for instance, the long closeup of the face of the placid, innocent ruined girl at the end of The Mill is something Thomas Hardy couldn't have bettered.  The Koch Vision DVD is a good transfer, but since the series comes from the early 1970s, the image isn't as clear as we've gotten to expect from quality television shows.",1391644800,,1064,4.689839572192513
8243887,5,B00124SNJS,Country Matters - A two DVD set containing 8 short stories (50 min each) from post WWI.  The stories are quite believable which is very refreshing in these days when all that matters is violence and sex.  The people are all involved in real life situations (except for The Ring of Truth which should have been dropped from the collection) and the endings are also quite real - not always for the best.  I only wish that I could buy all of the episodes that were made having missed them when originally broadcast.  Buy this collection - you'll want to watch most of these stories again.
