8310721,5,B0016OO7RG,"I thought this was an excellent set.  Not only do they review the greatest goals from 15 years of Barclays league, but they also provide a nice summary of each season and table standings.  They also review the best games from each season and summarize the league leaders and champions for each season.  The pace and narration are lively and keep you interested throughout the whole set.  I would highly recommend this set for any soccer fan!",1323302400,3,441,4.688311688311688
