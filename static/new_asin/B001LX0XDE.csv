3691577,4,B001LX0XDE,"Back in 1995 Jim Grimsley published DREAM BOY, the second novel of his continuing examination of the coming of age in the South and followed by the equally popular COMFORT AND JOY, BOULEVARD, FORGIVENESS, MY DROWNING  etc.  It took many years of for James Bolton ('Eban & Charley', 'The Graffiti Artist') to decide to adapt this story to the screen, and while Bolton elected to replace much of the lyricism of Grimsley's prose  with extended periods of non-verbal communication in the screenplay, the story of two high school kids coming to grips with a mutual attraction in the dank repressive aura of the South manages to still come through intact.

Nathan (Stephen Bender) is a quiet, reclusive sophomore in high school who is settling in to yet another move by his alcoholic, Bible-pounding, abusive father (Thomas Jay Ryan) and his sympathetic mother (Diana Scarwid). Next door lives handsome jock Roy (Maximillian Roeg) who befriends Nathan, shares homework, and when he is not with his girlfriend, offers Nathan rides in the school bus he drives.  Exchanges of glances and the growth of mutual attraction between the boys lead to a very private but sincere physical relationship: Nathan does not share with Roy that he has suffered sexual abuse from his father. Roy and his buddies - Burke (a very promising Randy Wayne) and Randy (Owen Beckman) - begin to join the boys on swimming gigs and finally a camping trip that includes visitation of an old deserted and possibly haunted plantation house.  What happens in this mysterious place provides the climax of the story - a brutal surprise ending that then transports the film into another dimension - a region the viewer must decide is satisfying or not.

There are some fine moments in this little low budget movie and the presence of Maximillian Roeg, Diana Scarwid, and Randy Wayne lifts the cast to a higher level of competence.  Whether or not the viewer is willing to go along with the ending will make the vote for or against the film.  Bolton does have a fine touch with stories about the coming out of young men in his films and his ability to capture the Gothic atmosphere of the South is solid.

3691578,5,B001LX0XDE,"Simply put, this was a brilliant movie. A gay coming of age story that will have you feeling good, feeling angry, and feeling sad. And the ending may confuse you but it leaves enough to the imagination to turn a tragedy into something happier. Great direction, great actors. Five Stars.",1282867200,2,286,4.74
3691579,4,B001LX0XDE,"Exceptionally shy and withdrawn teenager Nathan moved to rural Louisiana with his abusive, demanding father and his emotionally-distant devout Baptist mother.  Used to being alone, Nathan relishes the attention of Roy, a popular boy who drives the local school bus, and asks for Nathan's help with an English paper.  They become clandestine lovers, and go with two other boys on a camping trip, where they tell ghost stories, and ultimately take steps that will forever change their lives.

Based on the landmark 1995 novel by Jim Grimsley, ""Dream Boy"" (2008) is faithful to that source material, and is essentially a love story with paranormal aspects to it. Many people will love it, others will have problems with it, for the same reasons as many objected to the strange turn the original story took at the end. (Can't get much more in detail without giving away spoilers!)

Since the book was originally adapted as a play a decade ago, people have been waiting for this film, which has been a long time in production, probably because of its unique storyline.  It has been playing the gay film festival circuit for 2 years, with reviews hot and cold, as has been audience reaction. The lead actors, Stephan Bender (Nathan) and Max Roeng (Roy) do a commendable job with emotionally-challenging roles and somewhat inane dialogue, though Bender acts more comatose than shy and withdrawn at times. Rated a solid ""R"" for simulated sex and content that includes gay rape.  ...  DVD has no extras other than chapter stops.  Those who loved the book will want to give it five stars, those who didn't read the book will probably give this three stars.  I'll compromise at four stars out of five.  Your mileage may vary.",1282694400,5,1714,4.859106529209622
3691580,4,B001LX0XDE,"""Dream Boy"" is a film based closely on Jim Grimsley's 1995 book of the same name.

Passive high school sophomore Nathan (Stephan Bender) moves again with his protective mother Vivian (Diana Scarwid) and unstable father Harland (Thomas Jay Ryan), this time to the town of St. Francisville, Louisiana.  Neighbor Roy (Maximillian Roeg), a regular guy high school senior, gets to drive their school bus to and from school, allowing the new neighbors to get a good look at each other.

After cutting a deal in which Roy trades his math tutoring skills for Nathan's skills at tutoring English, they swiftly discover they have much more to offer each other.

Out at the local swimming hole, Roy introduces Nathan to two buddies, assertive Burke (Randy Wayne) and easy-going Randy (Owen Beckman), who have been observing Roy getting closer over time to Nathan.  Burke, who might have an unspoken interest in Roy himself, tests the waters by seeming to try to throw non-swimmer Nathan into the water.  Roy rises to the challenge, and Burke backs off.

After some harrowing trouble at home, the abject Nathan joins Roy, Burke, and Randy on an multi-day camping trip through marshy Louisiana.  Roy tells some scary stories.  They pair up in tents.  All seems to be going well.

Then the foursome come across the abandoned Kennicott plantation house.  Is it haunted?  Let's find out.  Nathan seems to sense some things.  The story then veers through heedlessness and violence to a supernatural but partly-happy ending where the relationship of Roy and dreamy, live-in-his-head Nathan is transformed.  Different people will feel differently about the resolution, which is slightly different from the book's.

The story, acting, locations, and sets are generally good.  Bender and Roeg both do well as the leads.  The setting appears to be in the 1970's or 1980's, as there is no electronic gear around anywhere.  One is reminded how lush and devoid of people the muddy Louisiana countryside can be.  The ambient homophobia is nowhere explicitly expressed but is universally assumed.  There are skin scenes for Roy, Nathan, and Burke, all of whom are lookers.  There are several sex scenes, not all pretty.

The only extras are trailers to three other movies.  The director (James Bolton) was quoted in a ""Bay Area Reporter"" review as saying the production was bedeviled by the homophobia of the current Louisiana locals.  (The state government was helpful, though.)  A commentary might have been educational.

It was curious that on my DVD feature play begins with a PG-13 rating announcement, whereas the cover said (correctly) the film is R-rated.

Both the book and movie forms of ""Dream Boy"" are recommendable.",1282694400,27,2701,5.075
3691581,5,B001LX0XDE,"Dream Boy has been a favorite book of mine since it was published in the mid-90's.  I have probably read it 8 or 10 times and always longed for it to be made into a film.  My wish finally came true, and what a beautiful film it is!  The setting of rural Louisiana is breathtaking while simultaneously emanating a repressive, foreboding backdrop for this subject matter - sort of like rural Wyoming was in Brokeback Mountain.  This has been said before, but the film really is very true to the book, especially in the lead characters of Nathan and Roy.  What casting!  Stephan Bender and Max Roeg TRULY are Nathan and Roy from the book brought to life on screen.  From their gestures, personas, and yes even looks.  They really look and behave exactly how I had always pictured in my mind's eye while reading the book.  Another standout in the cast is Randy Wayne as Burke.  He doesn't quite ""look"" like the character is described in the book, but plays the part perfectly right down to his eye movement (""Burke watches..."") and seems to know exactly what's going on between Nathan and his friend Roy from the beginning.
Like reading the book, watching this movie is, quite literally, like being inside of a dream (part beautiful based on the innocence and purity of a first love, part cruelly gut wrenching based on the horrors of sexual abuse and Nathan's fear) especially towards the end.  The ""ghost story"" aspect is not frightening at all, but provides a rather comforting, yet at the same time sad conclusion, at least for me.  It's as if Nathan will always be with Roy, even if just in spirit, which is comforting.  But also, I was left feeling as if Nathan's spirit can't rest and is left to wander in limbo.  I like to think he came back to Roy to let Roy know that it will be OK though.  I'm very much a romantic at heart.  I believe the ending of the film, like the book, is open to individual interpretation, but it will pull at your heart strings no matter what you believe is happening.  I know I needed about a third of a box of tissues during those last scenes.  And the soundtrack is mesmerizingly beautiful as well, which really adds to the impact.
I waited until I had watched several times to write this because I wanted to be as objective as possible.  However, it would be impossible for me to rate this any less than 5 stars.  Extraordinary!!",1282435200,11,2364,4.478971962616822
3691582,5,B001LX0XDE,"Having read the book, I knew what to expect. There were slight changes. But overall remained true to the story. Subject matter very deep & disturbing. But at the same time very beautiful,sad, & tragic. Highly recomend. And high praise to the director, the actors,& and the movie as a whole.",1282348800,14,290,4.705882352941177
3691583,5,B001LX0XDE,"It is such a shame that this movie is not released in DVD in US yet despite its all American production.  However, it is definitely worth waiting for to watch.  To appreciate the movie fully, I would suggest you read the book first in all its full glory.  Have a box of tissue nearby because it will rend your heart.  Then you can appreciate the movie in all its beautiful setting.  The cast is fantastic.  I am so captivated by the gorgeous A list young actors who play the leads.  They play the awkward boys experiencing their first love against a difficult environment believeably.  The only improvement I would have made is to put in more of the intimate conversations between the two boys from the book & stick to the book's ending more closely.

I have read the book 5x & watched this movie 3x.  If you are a romantic at heart, you should definitely give the book & movie a try.",1257033600,7,884,4.368098159509202

This movie is totally unsatisfying. The boy never gets to confront his father with what he's done. The mother does nothing until after her son is dead. I mean, what is this? And we don't know what happens to the boy's rapist/murderer either. Does he just go free? Well, at least the ghost of the boy gets to haunt his boyfriend and they live happily ever after.

3691591,2,B001LX0XDE,"The gays must be hard up for entertainment if this clunker is getting 5-star reviews. The plot is a rural coming-out story that's been told a thousand times before. The characters have limited personalities, and most of the acting is stiff. And don't even get me started on that old saw that homosexuality results from childhood sexual abuse. Just no. Abusive dad lurks around in hallways like he's the villain of a horror movie, and mom's big moment when she squeals ""Getawayfromhim!"" is unintentionally hilarious. But all of that pales to the out-of-nowhere ridiculous ending that some say is open to interpretation but really just adds up to utter nonsense.",1502496000,,660,5.009090909090909

It moves a bit slowly initially; but after the story and character development began, I really liked the story line, sad and tragic as it is, This was until the ""deserted mansion"" scene.

3691597,5,B001LX0XDE,"Others have given synopses of the plot.  It is meticulously crafted from beginning to end.  Nathan is abused, unspeakably lonely, and no help for him appears until he meets Roy who is brave, brave enough to be honest, kind, and to show the love he finds welling up within him.  In that world, Nathan could have found no better lover, but Roy's strengths may not be enough to protect the boy who has given him all his young love. There is a slowly gathering darkness that settles upon them both, a haunting presence, that foreshadows what may come, some fate that may not be turned aside.  The hallucinatory qualities of the film become ever stronger.  And the film ends with that ambiguous quality, a memory of a love that could not prevail or a loving presence that will be there forever.",1497225600,3,789,4.567375886524823

The first draw for me were the two cute lead actors, I mean... right? Looking them up on IMDB, I was kind of disappointed to find that they haven't done much more since then.
The music also struck a chord with me (no pun intended). I don't think a soundtrack was ever produced, but it would be nice to have.",1456876800,2,624,4.2521008403361344

3691606,5,B001LX0XDE,"In this first rate production of  Jim Grimsley's wonderful book, first love, gay coming of age and hidden emotions take center stage.

The setting is small town America where fundamentalist christianity rules the citizen's lives. The school bus is driven by the enigmatic Roy, who, most likely due to the town's limited resources, has the responsibility of ferrying the town's children to and from the local school. One day, a new student, the quiet and reserved Nathan moves into town with his parents. Since he lives across from Roy, he is his first passenger.

Both sets of parents are god fearing, church going christians and attend the same church with their sons.

Nathan's father is an abusive drunk and his mother is distant and submissive, leaving Nathan with little support. Roy is keenly observant of this, and becomes a friend and protector. As the friendship grows, there begins a romantic aspect to it, with Roy falling hard for shy Nathan.

Roy's friends grudgingly accept the new boy and make him a part of their group. As the relationship grows between Roy and Nathan, one of the others begins to suspect that Nathan is gay.

Roy and Nathan dream of one day leaving the miserable small town and heading out into the world together as partners. What Roy wants most of all to get him away from his abusive and neglectful family. The school bus represents the fact that Roy takes responsibility for not just Nathan's safety, but that of all the children. This gives the viewer  insight into Roy's character and that he is a caring and loving young man.

One day, during a visit to an abandoned house, Nathan is confronted and tricked by the homophobe and is beaten as they are leaving. Roy is unaware of what has happened, and his friend tells him that he shouldn't worry, that he probably got lost. The truth is much more brutal and devastating.

There are a few changes between the screenplay and the book, but the final sequence is very different. Although both tell approximately the same thing, I believe that the book's ending is better. Either way, the truth is devastatingly cruel and is left somewhat to interpretation. That said, it still says the same thing.

Beautifully photographed and with first rate production values, fine acting and sensitive direction, this film deserves a chance. Although tragic and quite realistic in its story of two boys who find a deep and wonderful love, although cut short by prejudice, it is a wonderful tale that needs a wider audience. It stands up well as a warning of the consequences of hate and prejudice.",1396656000,12,2570,4.794117647058823

3691608,2,B001LX0XDE,"The problem with Dream Boy is that it doesnt know what it wants to be, the romantic coming of age story that progresses through the first two thirds of the journey, or the murky, ambiguous gothic denouement which seems tacked on here, where its real ending ought to be.  And it is just that disjointedness which sinks this otherwise promising endeavor.  The film seems to have so much going for it.  The leads are well-cast, the rural small town setting is appropriately atmospheric, and the soundtrack music adds just the right notes.  The story seems on track, if a bit unoriginal.  But then it all goes awry.  Even if its audience were to be open to some sort of eerie paranormal twist, it would be right to expect a more intelligible ending.  Forget about being open to interpretation:  not only do the last scenes not fit with the earlier parts of the film, but they make no sense.  I would recommend this film only for the most die-hard fans of the novella on which it was based;  they will already be primed for a crappy ending, though slightly different than the one presented here.

Nathan is shy, introverted, very smart and new to the area. Roy is charismatic, maybe a below average student, lives next door to Nathan, and drives the school bus.
Nathan begins to help Roy with his homework, and the relationship between them quickly develops into a romance. The development of the relationship could easily be the development of a relationship between a boy and girl in another movie. However, in this case Nathan and Roy must keep their relationship secret, knowing what the reaction would be in the community at large, and from their strongly religious families.
I don't want to give to much away, but I will say that there is a relative flashback to past of one of the boys; and this relationship does not end well.",1381017600,,862,4.603896103896104

3691619,4,B001LX0XDE,"This is the story of Nathan (Stephan Bender) who has been moved to yet another new home by his dysfunctional father, who regularly moves using work as a cover story. Nathan is shy withdrawn and prone to acne, which even quality foundation won't really help with. This time they have landed up in St Francisville, situated just right of the arse end of nowhere.

Then he discovers that the boy next door, Roy (Maximillian Roeg), drives the school bus (which I found to be a bit of a stretch as he is a student at the school and a year above Nathan). The town is full of clap board houses, clap, clap Bible groups and clapped out cars. It is the sort of place that attracts dust. Nathan has the surf boy long hair and a languid approach to members of the opposite sex, which heighten the whole ambiguity of the film. He also has a couple of friends whose over  eager `jockness' juxtapose brilliantly with Nathan's withdrawn effeminacy.

It turns out Nathan is good at English and Roy isn't, so they decide to do some after school study, which inevitably leads to some serious extra curricular activities. This would be all well and good, but something about Nathans father seems to indicate, that he too is up for a bit of homespun schooling.

This then is Brokeback Mountain, without the mountain or the interludes in `togetherness', it is beautifully filmed and the musical score is both dramatic and effective, the acting is also above passable. There is one comic clich moment when one of the lads (Randy) says `Gee it is so hot out here', where have I heard that one before. Anyway it has enough twists and turns to keep your interest up, it is not a full on voyeur fest, but it does have its semi (oops) moments. And there are moments of real tension that make the viewing quite uncomfortable. The screen play and direction come from James Bolton who must be praised for making an emotional, emotive and challenging piece.

3691620,5,B001LX0XDE,"Rural dynamics can be tough... especially for those who have a hard time adapting to it. That's what happens with newcomer Nathan. And in the process or readjusting to this new environment he finds out there is one boy he can trust: Roy.

Is Nathan just a harmless and defenseless kid that seeks out protection? Or is he a very troubled boy, haunted by traumatic events that he never dares to share? Two elements are made obvious in the movie. One: the devastating effects of father on son incest. Two: the even more catastrophic consequences of excessive passivity. Nathan, just like his mother, is of a very submissive nature.

Some of the most classic psychoanalytic theories associate submissive-passive behavior with the figure of the abject. Abject is understood as the vilest and lowest position conceivable. It is of course imputed to male on male homosexual intercourse. What remains of interest about this theory, though, is that the abject works in terms of passivity. The male who allows himself to be penetrated is then the vilest and lowest; penetration is understood as the worst of the worst. But even these theories, in all their mighty psychological mumble jumble, seem to confuse the active position with the heterosexual identity. As a result, the straight guy who happens to ""top"" a gay guy can still brag about it, something he could never even disclose publicly if he had chosen to be the one in the passive position. This, of course, goes to all lengths, it can create hierarchies (for example, who penetrates who in jail), it can serve as an excuse for gay intercourse while maintaining a heterosexual faade, etc.

Throughout the film problems are avoided as long as Roy remains in his active position. Roy is the leader of a group of boys and he messes around with a girl, up until this point he could still claim he is straight despite his sexual encounters with Nathan. But when he assumes a more passive position regarding Nathan everything crumbles to pieces and tragedy ensues. When his friends catch him off guard practicing oral sex to Nathan he loses all power and authority. And because of that, his friends are now enabled to partake in abuses they might have not considered before. Consequently, one of Roy's friends will feel encouraged to rape Nathan and then to attack him violently and brutally.

There is also an important approach to Jacques Lacan's concept of symbolic death. There is an in-between place. There is an impasse between symbolic death and actual (real) death. Perhaps James Bolton correlates passivity with death. Or perhaps the film simply imbricates the repercussions of real death versus the significance and emotional strength involved in symbolic death.

""Dream Boy"" has a very sad and touching end. It does give conclusion to the premises established since the opening shots. And moreover, it makes the viewer realize how deeply human and fragile the protagonists are. Bolton's bold narrative surpasses the novel's qualities and delivers a stunningly beautiful film.",1320624000,3,3030,5.003968253968254
3691621,3,B001LX0XDE,the book dream boy was very good. the story of first love was well done.despite the years of abuse nathan could truly love someone. roy was the perfect choice for that first. however the ending not clear enough. NATHAN dies in that house. as he is losing his life he imagines a dream  where he is reunited with roy at the end. the movie on the other hand alludes to this but very cryticly-not done right but hollywood dictates happy or happy enough endings in 99% of thier movies. overall the movie is good and still worth watching and buying.  matt in stering hts. michigan,1317859200,4,574,4.457142857142857
3691622,5,B001LX0XDE,"People watch movies for different reasons. Some people like an elaborate, fast-paced plot. Others enjoy the visual and audio experience. I am the kind of movie watcher who enjoys a well executed and consistent tone and mood. In ""Dream Boy,"" the mood is both melancholy and sweet and there is a constant, if not always apparent, hint of anxiety and apprehension that builds throughout the movie. Capturing a mood is very difficult, and it relies on a number of factors including acting, cinematography, and music. While the acting of the supporting cast in ""Dream Boy"" can be somewhat inconsistent, the acting of the two main characters, Roy (Max Roeg) and Nathan (Stephan Bender), is very strong. I was particularly impressed with Bender whose performance reminds me of Gabourey Sidibe in ""Precious."" While it is true that the awkward, inarticulate teenager is well-trod territory in gay cinema, I've never seen the role acted so flawlessly. I was completely convinced that Bender was Nathan. Here we have a rare example of the kind of role that doesn't seem ""acted"" at all; it's as if Bender embodies the character. Sadly, I think actors with roles that are over-the-top, histrionic, and melodramatic often get the most praise, but it seems equally if not more difficult to portray a shy, introverted character, and the actors who really nail these roles often don't get the recognition they deserve (re: Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain). I've read some criticism that Bender's performance was ""wooden,"" and it strikes me that if you were not an awkward, inarticulate teenager you might not be able to identify with the performance, but if you were the kind of kid who stayed inside most of the day you will probably find the portrayal of your former self incredibly accurate and moving.

There is a lot of attention paid to subtle, non-verbal forms of communication - glances, stares, half-smiles, physical contact - all of which create a much more realistic depiction of young, gay love than the more chatty gay coming-of-age movies that I'm used to seeing. All of that being said, I understand the disappointment with the ambiguous denouement, but plots are relatively tangential for me. If the actors and director manage to depict a convincing mood, then that is all I need to be satisfied, and they have certainly done that with ""Dream Boy.""",1316304000,18,2350,4.979643765903308

This was one of those movies that lacked dialog at many points, but it didn't hurt the movie one bit.  Nobody ever said good acting involved constant talking.

The ending was a bit abrupt and unclear though.  I have no problem with the turn the movie took, it just was not very clear and there are aspects which just aren't believable.  So Roy gets caught in the act and then is so upset he allows the boy he has finally confessed his love for to be raped and murdered by his latently gay homophobic friend.

3691625,3,B001LX0XDE,"I've read many of the reviews of this film before making my purchase. I also read the description carefully. It sounded good and I discounted the negative reviews as being maybe biased or ""you can't please everyone"". BUT as I viewed this film, I was mesmerized right up to the last ten minutes or so, and then dropped flat on my face in disgust. This could have been one of the all time greats in gay cinema, but the ending however was the worse I could have imagined. Unlike many reviewers here, I did not read the book from which this film was based. And after watching the DVD, I never WANT to read the book.
I was enthrolled with the leading character Nathan (Stephan Bender) a part which was so very well cast and his acting was incredible. He nailed it to a tee all the way through. The rest of the acting was good, some parts better than others. The whole film seemed well done and was an enjoyable film to watch as you felt there was a very good point building up for the ending. Parts of the film were a bit hard to follow as the relationship between the lead characters was building over time, but once it took off, it went great! It was a pleasure to watch and kept my interest until the whole thing made a southbound turn into a horror film. The ending is not for the viewer who wants to see a great love story between two young men. If you liked the ending, then so be it, NEVERTHELESS you should surely agree that others need to be warned that this is not your average run of the mill love story and the ending can be quite devastating to the viewer if they are not prepared for it. That is the purpose of my review. I would have given this film a SOLID five stars were it not for the storyline ending in such an incredibly disappointing way. Watch it if you will, BUT BE PREPARED for the ending. You are NOT going to like it. What is billed as a coming of age film, about gay romance is nothing more than a horror film. ""Dream Boy"" was a very inappropriate title for this film. My five star rating fell to three over the ending alone, and quite frankly should have been no higher than a two. The actors however done an excellent job portraying their characters. There simply wasn't much they could do with a poorly written story. Not my idea of entertainment when the ending is horribly WRONG that it makes me want to punch the writer. Had it been based on a true story, and publicized as so, then it would hold some merit, but this thing was written from the dark mind of a very sick individual who doesn't much care for Love. Kind of like the father of ""Nathan"" who seemed quite pleased that his son would never be able to tell anyone what he had done.",1309910400,5,2669,4.2250489236790605

I have never read the book, so I cannot make any comparison between it and the film.

Neverthless, it was the ending that made me change my mind about it. I kept asking myself: what the director had in mind closing it the way he did? Are we still in the same reality or suddenly we are exported to another dimension?
I must admit that the last part of the movie was quite creepy. And last minutes only intensified my feeling.

The conclusion of Dream Boy brought a tear to my eyes, which is a good thing and a bad thing. It's a bad thing, because I wasn't in the mood to watch a sad movie.

3691635,5,B001LX0XDE,"I always expect to be surprised by love stories. Love seems to delight in showing up in the most improbable places and ways. In this film we discover, maybe for the first time for some of us, that true love will not be denied nor thwarted by an evil jealousy but will, against all rules of science, manifest whenever and whereever, bright and happy.
What makes this love story surprising to me is how the story itself motivates the actors. The portrayals of Nathan and Roy are due in large part by the actors understanding that both characters understand what is happening to them.  They are together experiencing true love. The actors are able to use this awareness to create gentle, compelling lovers.
While essentially Nathan's story of a hard life and abuse, the secondary story of Roy coming alive to his true sexuality is also rendered with depth and poignancy. The tender way he allows his girl to come to the understanding that their love is not to be shows his inate nobleness. And that he does so in order to be true to Nathan persuades us he is the right lover for Nathan for whom we have developed a tender regard. What we get from them, in their first kiss on, is that they both want the same thing: true love and all that true love brings.
We all know, though, that all the forces of evil will come against true love whenever it is found, nevertheless we are deeply saddened and shakened as we are subjected to an especially cold and brutal assualt that seems to end their love forever.
I know that some regard the resolution of this masterwork as sentimental and improbable but as for me I find it keeps true love's promise: whenever, wherever, bright and happy!",1298246400,7,1677,4.534653465346534

This movie is worse than bad...it is nonsensical, and a cheat.  The DVD information presents it as a ""coming of age"" movie.  Instead, we get a movie about homosexual rape and murder!

It also is slow-paced, tedious, and completely falls apart (in any capacity to understand or follow it's arc) when the characters go to a haunted mansion, and the rape/murder takes the story in a very wrong direction.

8319936,2,B001LX0XDE,"I really don't know how to begin.  Firstly, I did not read the book, so there is no comparison of the two in this review.  ""Dream Boy"" (which was actually released in 2008) tells a sort of coming to age film about the love between two young males.  That would be all well and good, but it tells it so confusingly and so removed many people won't know what it is supposed to be about.  I know I didn't.

A young boy and his parents have just moved to a small town in Louisiana.  Nathan, who is so painfully shy that he almost doesn't exist, seems to be almost immediately attracted to Roy, the next door hunk.  Lucky for Nathan, Roy also drives the school bus that Nathan rides.  Innocent glances are exchanged and a friendship is slowly--and I mean SLOWLY--developed.  However, as the movie unfolds, we find out there is much more to Nathan's life than we imagined.  That is a great premise for the movie, but it is what DOESN'T happen that left me scratching my head.

Director James Bolton never really tried to develop his characters and that is very unfortunate because there are many stories which could have been told.  The actors do a good job in ""going through the motions,"" but there are not scenes containing actual emotion to be found; it all feels forced.  Nathan, the main character, is so vapid it is hard for you to feel anything for him.  In fact, none of the characters in this film display any kind of real emotion.  There's wailing, groans, along with dumb looks and blank stares which did a huge disservice to this film.

Rated R for brief nudity, adult situations, language, and rape.  Had the director and screenwriter taken more time and actually developed their characters, this might have worked.  Caution:  This is not a movie for children.",1515801600,,1766,4.549206349206349
8319937,1,B001LX0XDE,"I will try and avoid giving away spoilers, though some of the folks critiquing this movie are not as considerate. (Wish I'd seen them first!) However, if giving away some of the elements would keep others from seeing this movie with similar expectations as I had, perhaps it would be justified.

I watched this movie based on the strong, glowing, positive reviews. (Did I watch a different movie?) I also saw it described as a ""coming of age"" story about two guys who fall in love.
I'm a sucker for love stories.

But this is NOT a love story!
At best, its possibly about two boysNathan and Roydiscovering their sexuality, and acting on a mutual attraction. At worst, it could also just be an older boy using a younger, very vulnerable boy to get his rocks off. (The sex is not reciprocal!)

I wasn't expecting car chases or explosions, but this movie is dreadfully slow. Thats not always a bad thing, when a deliberate pace is used to develop the plot, the characters, the setting, establish conflict, give insight into motivations, and such. This one is slow in a tedious, lethargic way.

All the actors seem intent on exuding intensity, but they deliver their lines like they're drowsy or drugged. (Only the latter state is recommended when watching this flick!) All the emotions were flat, subdued or suppressed. The only time I saw any semblance of real feeling was when Nathan's mother screamed at his father, trying to prevent what she knew was going on. Even the major tragedy in the story didn't elicit much emotion.

There's sustained periods of silence, and not all of it is the stereotypical brooding of teenagers struggling with their existence. People silently eat their meals, ride on buses, look out windows. The camera periodically pans through the woods, farmlands, a graveyardand cows. Yes, for some reason, we see several transition scenes of cows, grazing in the field. (I guess thats to remind us this movie takes place in a rural setting.)

Admittedly, a couple of elements in the story were unexpected to me. One was the relationship of Nathan and his parents, which I won't reveal here. Theres also a brutal rape, with devastating consequences.

There were elements of the story that made no sense to me. Some reviewers have defended the brutality as consistent with the place and time where the movie is set. I could buy that, if other elements were as consistent. For example, we have several scenes in a local Baptist Church. (For the record, I was in the Baptist ministry for more than 25 years, including during the time period depicted in this film.) If this is supposed to be rural Louisiana in the mid-70s, I kinda doubt it would be integrated. And having spoken at many Baptist churches, I can tell you that Ive never seen one with a crucifix. Baptists don't do that!

And then theres the rape. There were four friends on a hike. At some point, one of the boys rapes another of the boys. Where were the other two during this time? They were all in the house together, but suddenly they were absent while the rape happened. They didn't hear the screaming?

Afterward, I think we were also left completely hanging. We saw copsbut then were never told if the perpetrator comes to justice. The two boys had to know who did it. Did they inform the police?
We are not told.

Finally, there was the conclusion. Im intentionally not calling it an ending, because it wasnt. WTF was that? To me, it was just creepy.  Am I suddenly watching a different movie? A different genre?
Its like we changed from teen drama to horror to supernatural.

Some have said it's ""open to interpretation."" Perhaps. Or maybe the writer and/or director didn't know what to do. My interpretation: the finale sucked!

I won't say this is the worst movie Ive ever seen; I would never want it to win any kind of distinction. But I regret renting it, and caution anyone who has such an inclination.",1515283200,3,3897,4.68814055636896
