3596633,5,B001G5ZO8G,"It galls me that Nureyev is not as well-remembered as he should be.  Baryshnikov deserves his fame, but Nureyev led the way, breaking the old mold that kept male dancers in the background.  I believe our acceptance and ascent of strong male dancers even in the hip hop and music video worlds began with this charismatic genius, who stole the show just by walking onstage.  But his magic didn't end at mere stage presence--the man moved in mysterious and inimitable ways, and when he leapt...he stopped your heart and stole your breath.  It's hard to watch him in this particular video because he is only months away from passing away, and you can see he's struggling to be brave.  But the excerpts from his most celebrated dances are wonderful and he tells his own story with a Puckish twinkle that makes the words come alive.  If you really love dance...buy this DVD, in remembrance of one of the greatest dancers, ever.",1366156800,21,921,4.6894409937888195

3596636,5,B001G5ZO8G,"I saw Nureyev since the 60's. He was the most wonderful dancer, as soon as he was on stage he
commanded it! he was the only dancer you noticed, even if the stage was full with other dancers!

8304014,4,B001G5ZO8G,"CAUTION:  This dvd is the exact same one listed as:"" Nureyev, a Portrait"" ~ simply has a different jacket and a higher price.  Here is even suggested to buy them together, along with another.  Was looking forward to a new and different wonderful experience of watching Nureyev dance and perhaps more of his life story; more than a little surprised, and annoyed to see a duplicate of the one I had just watched, cheaper, different jacket.",1485129600,3,437,4.723684210526316

8304020,5,B001G5ZO8G,"This is a charming and informative DVD on Nureyev.  I loved the interviews of people from his past in Russia(including a centarian who first taught him ballet in Uffa) and with the people who worked with him after his defection.  He was truly a prodigy who lived up to his potential and helped to focus attention on the virtuosic dancing of male ballet dancers.  He was dedicated to his art in a way that is becoming rare.  His intelligence comes through so clearly in this production,",1368230400,9,485,4.604651162790698
