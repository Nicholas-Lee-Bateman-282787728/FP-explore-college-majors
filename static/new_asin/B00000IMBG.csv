7910839,3,B00000IMBG,"Well I stopped watching it because I was hoping there was an English dubbed version, That wasn't the case. However the movie it's self looked like there was a lot going on. Would have gotten a higher rating out of me. If it was understandable.",1521072000,,243,4.4222222222222225

7910843,4,B00000IMBG,"This film is silly! Jackie is a womanizing private eye, hired by a wealthy tycoon to locate his runaway daughter. Jackie tracks her to a cruise ship and Jackie ends up on board as well (including his female assistant). Before Jackie can grab the girl the ship gets hijacked and Jackie's distracted by having to save the passengers, not to mention finding time to flirt with an undercover operative and her partner.",1037059200,,414,4.763888888888889
7910844,3,B00000IMBG,"This movie was a great comedy first and an action movie second. This film emphasizes more or less the Simpson's brand of playful humor but mixes with  the eastern slapstick. This is the first eastern dubbed kung fu movie to  make me roll around laughing.
Although Jackie doesn't do his normal life  threatening stunts in this movie, he fights enough to keep the action  pumping to the end. This movie stars my favorite TV martial artist Gary  Daniels (Fist of the North Star/Bloodmoon etc) who shows off his muscles,  his flexibility and finally a great sense of humor.
The StreetFighter II  scene is a favorite of viewers in which Jackie Chan (who plays City Hunter)  is thrown through an arcade and turns into E. Honda And Chun Li plus his  friends turn into Dalsym and Guile. Of course the bad guy turns into ken  and smashes the lot of them.
My only complaints about this movie are the  sound effects, which always seem a moment late or too loud for a small hit,  which is common for oversea movies and annoying like crazy to the West.  This is a fun movie, more comedy than action more good than bad.",967593600,,1105,4.492462311557789
7910845,1,B00000IMBG,"I felt a bit embarrassed watching this. It's pretty lowgrade stuff, with only one decent fight and loads of stupid jokes. Not real Jackie Chan at all. Liked the Street Fighter bit though.",952905600,,187,4.696969696969697
7910846,1,B00000IMBG,It's interesting to see film makers decide to make an Anime but in live action. Starring Jackie Chan with wo things on his mind... Food And Women... this terrible movie decides to try to be funny in the style that  only a cartoon can show. There's no  fighting until the end and even then  it's all stupid. Jackie Chan gets zapped by the game Street Fighter 2 and  somehow turns in to the charcters for one scene. The dubbed voices are  terrible and I decided not to watch it after a certain point so I don't  even know how it ends. I am a fan pf Jackie Chan but even favorites make  mistakes... big ones.,948499200,,605,4.208695652173913
