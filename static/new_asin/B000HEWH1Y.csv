8139321,4,B000HEWH1Y,I love my movie collection 97% was bought from amazon I will continue to collect and I do from this sight and all movies were in excellent condition whether bought pre-owned or brand new not once did I receive a broke or scratched movie .

8139322,4,B000HEWH1Y,"Because I still liked it even though it was far inferior to the book.  This was one of the first mysteries ever written, I think.  It was a long book, and , having been written during the 18th hundreds, the writing style was very different from today's style. I loved that, but the movie, of course, could not  do that.",1364688000,,319,4.283333333333333
8139323,5,B000HEWH1Y,"Here are two of the best films ever presented on Masterpiece Theater.  Everything about each is first class, although I slightly prefer The Woman in White.  Yes, as critics have often noted, the films do not match entirely the novels by Wilkie Collins.  But in themselves, one couldn't ask for finer performances at all levels.

One must add, however, that there might be a problem for some viewers.  While keeping both films at two hours apiece, the filmmakers have sacrificed some clarity.  The complex plots are explained in great haste near the end of each film, and many viewers who have not read Collins could be confused.

In any case, this is art and entertainment of the highest quality and should remind us today of the excellence available to us on PBS not more than a decade ago.",1255996800,4,791,4.688405797101449
8139324,4,B000HEWH1Y,I purchased these items on DVD to replace items taped of PBS years previously.  They were excellent then and are equally interesting now.,1219536000,4,137,4.956521739130435
8139325,4,B000HEWH1Y,"The Woman in White was excellent.  The mystery was fascinating and kept us wondering up until the end about what was happening.  The Moonstone was not bad, but it seemed more long and drawn out.",1209513600,12,194,4.514285714285714
8139326,4,B000HEWH1Y,"Both of these films are intriguing British pieces. The Woman In White is perhaps slightly over-dramatized in this version, but the heart of the story is well captivated by the actors.

The Moonstone has long been a favorite mystery of mine, and this portrayal is rather brilliant.

It was a good purchase for those anglophiles that enjoy nothing better than a good British period movie.",1180051200,22,386,4.923076923076923
8139327,2,B000HEWH1Y,The producer has taken artistic licence a little too far.  Miss Halcombe was called Miss Fairlie.  Why?  The earlier BBC version was much better and accurate.,1170288000,8,158,5.0
