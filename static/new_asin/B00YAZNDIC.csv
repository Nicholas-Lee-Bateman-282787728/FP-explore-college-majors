7209287,3,B00YAZNDIC,"""The Bloody Indulgent"" has a fun, entertaining, and offbeat story that really sinks its teeth into the rock opera while fusing in the Trash cinema punk attitude that is notoriously celebrated in ultra indie, LGBT camp theatre. Now this musical isn't going to appeal to the mass majority of horror fans, it may not even meet with the standards for those horror fans that like horror musicals. I can't really say. I liked it a lot. Now I am not a big musical person, I have a few in my collection but for the most part I avoid them like straight porn. However I would say that ""The Bloody Indulgent"" has a edgy, energetic pulse that fits between ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and ""Scarrie! The Musical"".

The special effects and music are both pretty basic. But there is tons of blood. Buckets of blood. Splatter, blood drool, blood stains. The effects are pretty decent and for the most part practical effects. There is some use of CGI but not an extreme amount. The music is a mix of good and bad. There are some songs on here that I could definitely find on repeat, with punk rock, energy that really amps up the story. There are some scenes where the singing drags the story, or just doesn't have the same energy or ""umpf"" to keep the film rising to the climax. But the singing and humor thrown in there is organic, honest and fun.

Overall, I personally loved ""The Bloody Indulgent"". I understand that I may be in the minority, and the film is far from perfect. However I liked the cast, the blend of Gothic and Worholian characters were some of the best I have seen in horror musical cinema, or Trash cinema. Plus the film mixes subcultures, like the stripper, the female impersonator, the indie avant garde performer, the carnies. It is all just one big mix of underground funkiness and madness. And explicit, exploitative drug use, drug reference, and the situations were entertainingly kitsch. This is just one of those guilty pleasure films that is pure fun and craziness. Again, this is only gonna appeal to a small segment of the indie community that likes, off beat, odd, bizarre theatrical stuff.",1437350400,2,2110,4.624
7209288,5,B00YAZNDIC,"First of all, don't take this too seriously. If you do, you are liable to be disappointed. If you don't, this could easily be the best thing you watch all year.

This film is hilarious. It's so far over the top it can see the curvature of the earth. No other film on God's earth has started off a musical number with 'Here we are in this scuzzy little toilet', and God help us, may it never happen again. From the entire song involving double entendres (and then flat-out statements) about a vampire's penis size, to the Zombie Flesh-Eating 101 scene, this entire movie is a spiritual successor to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, if RHPS had been pumped full of industrial-strength cocaine and made to sleep rough for a few weeks.

Kevin Scott Richardson (of the Backstreet Boys) deserves special praise as Burt, the sleazy, OTT vampire who could use a dose in self-control and probably a shower as well - not that the show was ever anyone else's, but he steals it from himself repeatedly; from his obsession with stealing people's shirts, to his childish petulance as he storms off with a bag of cocaine with a net worth bigger than most of London, he is by far the best character. I challenge you to ever watch the video to 'I Want It That Way' straight-faced ever again after watching this movie.

However, mention must be given to Brandon Heitkamp as Todd, the sexually-confused young vampire friend of Burt's - whether he's cautiously testing out his newfound 'vampire bisexuality' or ordering pizza delivery-men (yes, you read that correctly) with strange young women, he is an audience stand-in that does not fail to make you cry laughing with his constant exasperation at Burt's childish antics.

Now... could anyone explain the ending to me?",1435622400,,1749,4.743421052631579
7209289,4,B00YAZNDIC,"Stars: Kevin Scott Richardson & Diva Zappa.

write ,directed by : Ken Roht.

So, There is this well known neighborhood Vampire ( Richardson) and he loves his strippers,cocaine and drinking ANY blood available or not immediately.

Did we mention its mostly a musical,Like Rocky Horror or maybe Young Frankenstein on Broadway ?

There are alot of hits and a few misses in plot,songs and execution of Horror,Music and Comedy.

The cast is actually pretty good and give much support to Richardson.

Wonder what the other Back Street Boys think of Kevin spewing neck tissue,blood constantly dripping from his mouth/chin and the occasional(constant depiction) of him snorting cocaine and maybe that is to explain why he so haphazardly devours victims and tears at their clothing while mid-devour.",1434931200,,790,5.23015873015873

7209292,5,B00YAZNDIC,"To love this movie you have to like strippers, cross dressers, bisexuality, zombies, blood, singing, gore, sex, drugs, rock n' roll, killing, yelling, twins, dwarves, dancing, weird hair, make up and costumes, all done up in a musical. And most of all vampires! ... and people who should be A list actors but who probably don't give two s***s about it. Oh yes and you must like fairies, except there weren't any. Oh wait, yes there were. Twinks. This movie was loaded with talented actors who could sing, dance and entertain, and seamlessly do it all in a low budget flick.

7209296,3,B00YAZNDIC,"For the most part, but honestly it either needed to be a shorter movie or have the plot filled a little better. And I never thought I would say this but the the nudity didn't actually make the movie more enjoyable. And this is coming from a guy who first started watching horror movies before he was 10 mostly for the bare breast scenes. They were nice breasts but the music lyrics often took a nose dive whenever the subject shifted to sex.

I can tell they were trying for something like Repo and I think that they actually came close but missed by a bit.",1448150400,,557,4.254716981132075

8717827,5,B00YAZNDIC,"I gave this movie 5 stars for 1 reason. Quite simply put, I enjoyed it.  I think you might enjoy it too if you don't take it seriously,  It's a musical comedy. I don't like musical comedies but I loved this. Think ""Rocky Horror Picture"" show meets ""Zombieland"" and take away75% of the budget.",1489017600,,292,4.388888888888889

Rocker Frank Zappa's youngest (Diva Zappa) plays Connie in this flick.  It's actually rather funny.  It's a musical in the sense Rocky Horror was, it's a ""story"" in the loosest sense of the word.  Burt (Kevin Scott Richardson), a vampire, creates one vamp, Todd (Brandon Heitkamp), which ends up nailing his girlfriend, Connie, who goes on a tear.

A town gets upset about the vampishness of it all and then decide to hire someone to off poor ole Burt.  Don't take this too much to heart and you just might find that you like it.",1474502400,2,764,5.963302752293578
