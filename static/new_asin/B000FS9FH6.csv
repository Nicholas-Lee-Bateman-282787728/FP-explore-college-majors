2583183,5,B000FS9FH6,"The Ultimate Pirate Collection is not only a great collection of exciting sea-faring adventure movies, it is a study of the evolution of movies as they transformed themselves from silent to sound. Movie buffs will be fasinated with the production techniques used to craft these old films. They also deal with very interesting social and political situations that are very intersting to history buffs. Being both a history buff and a movie buff myself, I could not be happier with this collection. It's the best $8.47 I have spent for a long time.",1219968000,10,546,4.881720430107527
2583184,5,B000FS9FH6,"This is a great DVD, filled with tons of old pirate-related TV shows and movies.  A great collection for pirate buffs like myself!",1216339200,4,130,4.6521739130434785
2583185,1,B000FS9FH6,The only good part of the whole box set is the 14 Adventures of Long John Silver.  I couldn't even get through most of the rest.  I was born in the 70's not the 40's.  I wouldn't even bother with collection if I was you.,1196553600,2,220,3.8444444444444446
2583186,4,B000FS9FH6,"One of the titles in this DVD box set is based on a Jack London story, and some of Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"" characters figure quite prominently here, as well. There's lots of high seas adventure in THE ULTIMATE PIRATES COLLECTION, including fourteen half-hour installments of the very first TV series made in Australia. ULTIMATE PIRATES gets a well-deserved 'G' rating (for 'G'reat fun). Or maybe this one should be rated ""Arrrrrrr!""

2583187,3,B000FS9FH6,"It all came to me in one piece and the clarity was as good as one could get on a few of them that where extremely old. My husband is enjoying them. Seems like a good mix..I would recommend it to anyone that is a die-hard pirate fan if they don't mind some real oldies in here,like back in the 30's..a couple of movies though I questioned with they where in the category of pirates,though they where high seas adventure stories. It was worth the money.",1169164800,10,451,4.255813953488372

8125966,3,B000FS9FH6,The Long John Silver shows are above par for tv shows so they are good and the sequel to the disney Long John Silver is there too.  The classic films are good except for a few made in the 1960s and 70s....the art of movies took a major nosedive after the 50s and still hasn't returned because of immorality in films.  Just don't bother watching the few duds in this collection.,1392854400,,377,4.295774647887324
8125967,5,B000FS9FH6,"This is a gold mine of pirate stuff.
If Robert Newton is not the ultimate pirate, I couldn't imagine who would be.
But the real reason I got this was because of the movie ""Corsair,"" starring Chester Morris and Thelma Todd.
She was something special.  There have been a lot of sexy women in the history of Hollywood, but she was right up there among the elite.
The unfortunate thing is that there aren't that many movies that she played in that have survived.  But she was a terrific comedienne, as well as a great looker.
She had a very earthy, real quality to her - very approachable, and not aloof and unattainable, like many of the raving beauties of the silver screen seemed to be.
Of course, in real life, they may have been just as down-to-earth as the girl next door - who knows?
But she was murdered, and her killer was a big mystery, for a long time.
Chester Morris, her co-star in this movie, was managed by the same man who was Thelma Todd's manager and partner, and this partner was suspected in her murder, but I think was acquitted in a trial.
But he confessed to Chester Morris on his deathbed that he actually was the killer, and Chester Morris kept it quiet until his own death.",1364688000,2,1195,4.378378378378378
