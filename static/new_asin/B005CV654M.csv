8465889,3,B005CV654M,"This is a review for Theory of Leisure class, I never watched the other 3 movies so I cant comment on them. Theory of Leisure class is about how this mothers two young children are murdered. As the film goes there are other murders, and sucides connected with the two childrens deaths. This movie has some of its good moments, but at times is kind of on the boreing side. The best thing about this movie is the music video on the special features part of the dvd. Tuesday Knight performs the song if it takes all night, Tuesday Knight played Kristen Parker on nightmare on elm street 4. It could be a movie worth getting, but only if your a diehard fan of nightmare on elm street, but other people might like it also.",1370563200,2,717,4.318518518518519
