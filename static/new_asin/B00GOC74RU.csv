6094907,4,B00GOC74RU,"A nice way to 'fix' the 'Complete Bewitched' set with these Two BLACK & WHITE seasons.
Having the 2 Colorized seasons in the Box Set was dropping the ball. This makes it ok now, good job.",1394064000,18,187,4.222222222222222
6094908,5,B00GOC74RU,"So first things first: the TV series itself get's the five stars.

This DVD collection gets three stars and here's why:

Almost nine years ago Sony released Seasons One and Two on DVD in both black and white and colorized forms. As far as I can tell when comparing the Mill Creek set to the Sony set, these are the same prints with the exception that Mill Creek has corrected the copyright date in the opening credits to be correct to each season. However, it's still the generic third season opening. So really, if you purchased the Sony sets before there is really no reason to get this set.

Now for the good parts:

The FBI warning screen Mill Creek's logo screen go by in less than about six seconds total when you first pop in the disc. And when you go to watch an episode you don't have to have another FBI warning screen.

The six discs contained herein are on a spindle and the DVD case is just the same size as any regular DVD movie case so it takes up much less room than the Seasons One and Two from Sony do.

Another great thing is that there are at least twelve episodes per disc which makes for a great marathon watching.

There are chapter breaks in the episodes but unfortunately the skip from the middle break goes straight to the end credits rather than the tag scene...but that's a minor irritation.

Overall, I would say, if you haven't all ready purchased the Sony sets, and especially if you weren't able to get the black and white sets before, this is a definite purchase must! Also, it would be make a great INEXPENSIVE gift for someone whom you know likes Bewitched. And it can be found other places for half the cost.

My wish is that one day Sony will realize the greatness of this show and release a set that the show deserves that includes the sponsor openings and closings, the cast commercials, the ABC promos, etc. (see Time Life's release of ""Get Smart"" or Image Entertainment's release of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show."")",1390176000,28,1950,4.424581005586592
6094909,5,B00GOC74RU,"I remember back in the early 1990's when Columbia House would release a VHS tape of ""Bewitched"" every 5 weeks or so and waiting patiently that they would have on the tapes episodes from the first  two years as I didn't have ""Nick at Nite"" (who aired the complete series) and I had never seen the first two years as they were never put into the syndication cycle.

 Those VHS tapes cost me a pretty large fortune as they were at least $30.00-$40.00 a piece and each tape only had 4 shows!

 Now you can own what is to me the very best of ""Bewitched"", the first two seasons in black and white. The characters are introduced, the plots well-written and Elizabeth Montgomery looks amazing as does Agnes Moorehead.

 The price here for this 6 disc pack, 2 season set is remarkable! Grab it!

 There is one issue though: Why Sony would take out the original episode openings from these seasons is beyond comprehension. What you get instead is a decolorized version of season 3-5. But that really is my only complaint.

 Sit back and enjoy classic ""Bewitched"" a show that will always be around!",1388361600,5,1087,4.523076923076923
6094945,5,B00GOC74RU,"I loved watching this show on Nick at Night as a kid. Now that I am 29, there are some truly sad things going on in my life. I kept trying to find recently aired shows that were funny, but I had either seen it (usually twice) or it had a dark edge that brought me down.
I bought this, along with all of the other seasons, because at the time that I purchased it was less expensive than buying the combined ""Complete Series.""
Season 1 has been a joy so far--just like I remembered.",1503014400,,480,4.063157894736842

6094950,4,B00GOC74RU,"I am a huge fan of this series so I was excited to get the fist two seasons. They look great, bring back memories, etc. but this is not the complete first and second seasons. For some reason, they've left off quite a few of the greatest episodes. Don't get me wrong, to have the first two seasons not colorized is great, but my favorite episode ""Disappearing Samantha"" (Dick York's comedic timing in this episode is classic) is a major disappointment. There are about 10 episodes missing from season 2 and that's a shame. Mind you, it doesn't say ""Complete Seasons 1 & 2"" so it is what it is.",1479945600,11,592,4.390909090909091
6094951,3,B00GOC74RU,"I love bewitched. I watched it as a child, and I actually liked the movie. Not saying it was fantastic or the best movie ever, but I liked it. My problem with these dvds (and stick with me, I have many) there are too many episodes on each discs and no bonus features. None. Whatsoever. Second, there are episodes where the audio goes out for a few seconds. Third, the discs are stacked on top of one another and very difficult to get out of the packaging. I had to take them out and put them in another case. I have bought Millcreek dvds before and the only problem I've ever had is when my Gidget complete series disc paused for a few seconds. I returned it, ordered a new copy, but it just did the same thing. AGAIN. I didn't want to have to buy the seasons separately and I wanted them in black and white, but the cons outweigh the risks here. while I love the episodes and characters (especially sweet aunt Clara), I don't like what Millcreek did here. I know some people will say they don't buy dvds for bonus features and believe me, I don't always either, but I was disappointed in this set for more than just that",1478044800,2,1121,4.242990654205608

There was a glitch with the very first episode on disc 1 that made me worry about the quality but that is the only hiccup in the 20 or so episodes I have seen. Interesting to look for other ""stars"" as guests e.g., Adam West (Batman) and Mareen McCormick (Marcia Brady).

6094975,1,B00GOC74RU,"I unwittingly purchased the colorized versions of seasons 1 + 2 when Bewitched was first issued on DVD by Sony Pictures Entertainment. I always meant to purchase the black and white editions that they also offered but never got around to it.
Thought I'd get the Mill Creek Entertainment issues since they are newer issues.
DO NOT BUT THE MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT versions of Bewitched (Seasons 1 & 2 in black and white.)!!!
The quality is terrible. There were two glitches in the first fifteen minutes of episode one alone, one of which causes a gaff in the dialog. Darrin and Samantha are about to ring the doorbell at a party as they walk up to the door. Their first part of their conversation is clipped. I immediately compared it to the Sony Pictures Home Entertainment version. The Sony version does NOT have the glitch. It is completely intact. (The other glitch also only occurs in the Mill Creek version.)
Seek out the Sony Pictures Home Entertainment issues if you want the black and white versions!",1411862400,3,1008,4.732954545454546

6094979,4,B00GOC74RU,"I picked this DVD up at a supermarket. I fondly remember watching this sitcom series usually during my summer months as a child. What I didn't expect was how much I enjoy it now? This sitcom was funny and smart without being silly. It had a first rate cast.

Darrin Stephens is a New York ad executive. The first episode shows their meeting, romance, and wedding. The first several seasons, Darrin was played by Dick York. He had to leave the show due to health issues. Elizabeth Montgomery is unforgettable and brilliant as Samantha Stephens, full blooded witch, who married a mortal like Darrin. You can't forget Endora, Samantha's mother and witch. Agnes Moorhead is also brilliant in the role of mother-in-law. Alice Pearce plays nosy neighbor Gladys.

The first two seasons are fine and wonderful in black and white. The DVDs play perfectly! If I have a complaint, I would have liked to know more about the stars. Elizabeth Montgomery was a beautiful, funny, kind good witch. Dick York was perfectly cast as Darrin. Agnes Moorhead was brilliant as Endora. There is a strong supporting cast like Alice Pearce who earned an Emmy posthumously. She was perfect as nosy Gladys Kravitz. George Tobias was perfect as her non believing husband, Abner. I loved Marion Lorne as Aunt Clara. Mabel Albertson was perfect as Darrin's mother. Unlike shows today, Bewitched did 37 episodes a season. There are 74 episodes. Sadly, I would have liked to know more about behind the scenes. I Love Lucy did 35 episodes in its first season. The I Love Lucy DVD first season had so many extra features. I wished the same for this DVD too.",1401667200,7,1621,4.765124555160142

6094981,5,B00GOC74RU,"If you're on a budget, then these combo packs are perfect for you.
$9.96 per pack, and although you aren't getting the original ABC broadcasts these are just as nice.

Pros:
Black & White is the only format available for these seasons.
The episodes look remastered, but still have an authentic look to them.
Sony has gone back and deleted the CPT Holdings, Inc. copyright in the intro
13 episodes are on each disc, so it makes for a great watching marathon.
The discs aren't stacked, instead Mill Creek has gone all out and released it in a 6 hub disc case.

Cons:
The original intro is not preserved, instead we get the desaturated intro they re-introduce in 1989.
No Sponsor openings/closings
The original Screen Gems logo and the 1965 logo have been replaced with a 2005 Sony Pictures Television logo (using a tweaked version of the original 2002 theme)
The audio sounds like it's been amped up but it comes off as sounding too loud.

I purchased this set from a local retailer and I have to say that I'm not impressed with this release in the slightest. Mill Creek is known for producing crap DVD releases and this just showcases the problem. Cramming several episodes onto a single DVD always creates problems with the remastering process and between poor video quality to major anti-aliasing problems on either side of the viewing area ... I would pass on this release and sim,ply purchase the original Sony Pictures releases. Not worth the poor quality.",1397692800,3,597,4.796116504854369
