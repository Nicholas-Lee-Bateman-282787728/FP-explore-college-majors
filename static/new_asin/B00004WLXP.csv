1365944,1,B00004WLXP,"I bought this for my  3 year old son who loves spiderman.  However, it's less about spiderman and more about inappropriate language, cleavage, tight outfits and sexual innuendo or spiderman directly making out with women.  An oh yeah, let's not forget spiderman's latte and martini drinking buddy.  What a pathetic video.  Obivously created by some attention starved techno-geeks who sought to create a sexual adventure dream world.  Suprised Marvel put their  name on this.",1218931200,2,474,5.324324324324325
