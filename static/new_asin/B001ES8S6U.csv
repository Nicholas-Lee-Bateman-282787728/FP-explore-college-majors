8299431,1,B001ES8S6U,"Received a DVD-R that didn't even have ""Ballet"" spelled properly on the disc -- in a clear plastic case that did not look anything like the image advertised on Amazon, and without so much as a photocopy of the front and back of the original packaging, or any notes contained therein.

Returning this, I don't care to pay $28.98 for a DVD-R.  For what I was sent, $10 should have been the top price.  False advertising.",1276819200,5,418,4.473684210526316
