8197951,4,B000QXCP4A,"This is a well documented piece of coverage of the ongoing drug wars currently raging in the streets of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.  Mr. Rather once again provides fine narrative details of many aspects of the drug wars that continue to reign terror on both sides of the border.  It is my hope that documentaries like this make their way into U.S. society so that others will truly know what is brewing down on the border.  As a federal law enforcement officer I recommend this product for anyone who thinks they know what is happening on the US/Mexico border.  Some of you will be shocked beyond imagination at what you see. And hopefully this documentary and others like it will cause people to react and take action.  The people of this nation need to know the situation that U.S. law enforcement faces in dealing with the violent drug traffickers, and this is a very good starting point.  Four out of five stars.",1197676800,2,910,4.62111801242236
