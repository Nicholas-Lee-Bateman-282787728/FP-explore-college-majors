8213230,4,B000UGMZ1G,"I snagged this DVD to add it into my large field sequential 3-D movie collection.  Granted, it isn't FS3D at all, but it's still very cool nonetheless.  If you have the WinAmp program for your computer and play music while the awesome MilkDrop visualization is active, you get something like this, but MilkDrop is a hundred times better.  This is more on the lines of a colorful kaleidoscope moving to the ambient music playing to each trip.  You would expect a film with the title ""Trancetrip"" to have Trance or Goa music.  The soundtrack is meditational in tone, but not head-tripping enough.  Don't get me wrong here, I'm not saying it is bad.  On the contrary, I found the music very pleasant, just would have loved to hear some actual Trance-style tunes instead.

As for the 3D glasses, these are not ""ChromaDepth"" style specs.  They are Rainbow Glasses and create multiple bows from any light source.  True ""ChromaDepth"" specs, which I have, do just that; give depth to the colors by moving red to the foreground and all the other colors fall into line behind it according to the rainbow spectrum.  I've looked at the film with both glasses and each give their interesting affects, though to truly enjoy the experience of the visuals, stick with the rainbow glasses.  Make sure that there are no light sources around your TV while watching.  It will destroy the CGI kaleidoscope effects.  The brilliant thing about the rainbow specs is that it literally blooms the visuals out away from the screen.  The further back you go, the larger it is.

On the whole, the DVD is well worth having for the enjoyable patterns and ambient music, all done nicely with the rainbow glasses.  If you like 3D effects, snag the film and enjoy.",1231804800,9,1730,4.713333333333333
8213231,5,B000UGMZ1G,"This DVD is amazing. It runs about 1 hour long and comes with 2 Pairs of Chroma depth 3D glasses neatly packed in the case. I recommend sitting at least 6 feet away from the screen and focus on the center of your TV, just let your peripheral vision do the rest. The soundtrack is also brilliant. The visuals follow the rythem of the music. This is garenteed to put your brain at ease. Cant wait for volume 2!!",1208131200,9,409,4.189873417721519
