2356789,4,B000A3XZ0E,"This is an interesting early Russian opera with strong Italian influence (complete with many cabalettas).  The singing is uniformly good, if not excellent--but it is also mostly of the stand and deliver type--very little interaction of characters or dramatic staging.  Sets are effectively painted in a typical Russian manner.  The opera is performed to an empty hall (seen occasionally behind the conductor) so not only is there no applause but there is also a certain lack of tension or excitement in the performance.  Still, this is an important addition to the DVD catalog of Russian operas.",1128297600,25,595,5.166666666666667
2356790,5,B000A3XZ0E,"Glinka's A Life for the Tsar, the first of the two operas by the composer, and considered to be the very first truly Russian opera, has obviously played a very significant role in the world of Russian music since its 1836 premier. Commissioned by Tsar Nicholas I, the opera was composed by Glinka under his full supervision, and it fit the Russian political agenda of the time perfectly; which largely contributed to its initial success. During the Russian Revolution, the opera was banned for many years because of its pro-tsar message, until it was unearthed by Stalin, who commissioned a new ""soviet-friendly"" libretto. Even though the ""Ivan Susanin"" (the new title given) was one of the most popular operas in Russia, the new libretto had plenty of logistical problems, and was simply not as fluent. Plus, much music had to be cut from the score in the Soviet version, such as the majestic coronation scene at the end.

So, with the fall of the Soviet Union, the Bolshoi was quick to restore the original score and original libretto by Baron Rozen. To get an idea of just how fast, the USSR fell in 1991, and this performance is from 1992. Up until now, there was no single all around excellent recording of this opera, especially in the West. This new DVD by Kultur is everything that I wanted and more; a truly superb performance from everyone.

The role of Ivan Susanin is considered to be the quintessential Russian bass role (even more so than Boris Godunov). The role requires volume, a commanding presence, but it also requires an excellent actor who can be fatherly and sympathetic. Evgeny Nesterenko meets all those requirements, and proves to be one of the best Susanin's ever, right up there with Mikhailov and Reizen. True, Nesterenko maybe a little past his former stentorian prime, but at this point in his career, his voice was just the right color for Susanin. Nesterenko is also a tremendous actor who knows this role inside-out; you can actually sense the pain in eyes during his big aria and recitative, when Susanin sees that his death is inevitable; absolutely convincing. This portrayal is a tremendous accomplishment; one for the ages.

The other big star here is the tenor Alexander Lomonosov. Sobinin is one of those unsingable grand opera tenor roles, much like Arnoldo in Guglielmo Tell, where the singer needs to sound very dramatic but also be able to hit a high C every few minutes. Lomonosov makes it seem like there is nothing to it.

Elena Zaremba, a real contralto, is excellent as Vanya, Susanin's adopted son, managing to get across much boyish charm. She also comes up big in her Act 3 aria. Marina Mescheriakova starts off a bit shrill, but manages to finish off successfully. She too, is convincing in her role. All of the charming ensembles come off very well coordinated.

This also happens to be the most chorus heavy opera I have ever heard. The chorus has more music than any of the soloists, and the music requires a real virtuoso choir to pull it off. The Bolshoi chorus is tremendous with unbelievable pitch precision the whole way through. The Bolshoi orchestra under Alexander Lazarev know what they are doing. The orchestra sound is very ""authentic"" and they leave plenty of excitement to spare.

The production is done in the ""risk-free"" old Bolshoi style; very traditional. The direction can static at times, but you can  be sure that there aren't going to be any unpleasant surprises. This is good, because most people have never seen a production of ""A Life for the Tsar"" before, it is best to introduce it the traditional way. A long ballet sequence is given in the Polish court; pleasant dance music, but it overstays its welcome. A minor quirk is that they cut out a very beautiful, but long ensemble number in the first act that I remember as being a high point in other recordings. However, I'm no musicology expert, but I am pretty sure that there is some music in here that I've never heard before. Nevertheless, they could have cut a section of the ballet to make room for that number. Furthermore, if you are easily annoyed by audience noise, it's your lucky day, because there isn't any whatsoever. This also means that all of the applause is cut out, and there are no curtain calls. Not to make a big deal about it, but I would have liked to see hear some of the audience reactions to this wonderful performance; just feels like something is missing.

Yes, this opera showcases much of Glinka's bel canto influence, but it doesn't overwhelm it like he does in his second opera: Ruslan and Lyudmila. And, if you are familiar with Ruslan, you might agree that there a few parts of that which are rather sleep inducing. None of that here, every moment brings you something fresh and exciting. Even the ridiculously long ballet gets old, but never gets dull or looses energy. Now with this being released, and the Kirov's wonderful Ruslan and Lyudmila out there, all of the Glinka's operatic output is available on DVD. I highly recommend this DVD to everyone interested in Russian opera, or any opera in general.",1126828800,57,5078,4.742921857304643

8074197,5,B000A3XZ0E,"A Life for the Tsar  - or Ivan Susanin, as  known originally and later during the Soviet era  - is an opera in four acts and an epilogue, and  the first of  Mikhail Ivanovich Glinka's  (1804 -1857)  two masterworks,  Ruslan and Lyudmila being the other.
As the first  officially recognized Russian composer of classical music,  Glinka, incidentally,  is considered the father of Russian music.  As such, he has influenced all  Russian composers,  particularly  so the members of  The Mighty  Five or the Mighty Handful, Alexander Borodin (1833-1887), C&eacute;sar Cui (1835-1918),  Mily Balakirev (1837-1910),  Modest Mussorgsky (1839-1881) and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1844-1908).
A Life for the Tsar is considered  the first true opera  displaying a musical idiom which - although  remaining consistent with the Western  traditions - is genuinely Russian.  The opera  describes the heroic adventures  of  peasant and patriotic champion Ivan Susanin who loses  his life  after  distracting  the Poles and  leading them astray in order to  prevent them  from capturing  Tsar  Mikhail I  (the  original member of the Romanov family. Set in 1612 Russia, it  was  inspired by a work on the same subject by Italian composer Catterino Cavos who, in fact,  directed the orchestra  during the  premiere on December 9 1836.
The present interpretation was recorded at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow in 1992, that is  one year following the fall of the Soviet Union.  It is sung in Russian, with  the choice of English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese or Spanish subtitles.  Bass Evgeny Nesterenko  plays the  lead role of  Ivan Susanin (supposedly a peasant, but  looking  onstage more like a member of the Russian aristocracy) with  the Bolshoi Symphony Orchestra and Chorus conducted by  Alexander Lazarev.
The music -  without recitative sections - is  beautiful throughout the entire 175 minutes of its duration. That means it remains moving, whether: (1)accompanying  happy events, such as the victory celebrations by the Poles,  or  the  wedding preparations by Susanin`s daughter Antonida; or (2) depicting  agonizing  emotions, for example, those of Susanin who - immediately after saving the Tsar`s life - expresses his anxiety about the coming of the dawn and, with it, his final moments on earth.
Anxiety and death, incidentally, are  unusual occurrences for us westerners, used to believe that successful heroism is naturally followed by triumph  and happiness.
Beautiful and entirely fitting  is also the staging, bright and colorful  when the background to happy events; dark and daunting,when taking us in  the dense gloomy forest, where Susanin sings his very last lines.
Loyal  to the Russian tradition,  Glinka did not forget to include some  classical ballet in his work.  In fact, he dedicated a substantial  portion of the second act to ballet dancing - an  uncommon practice in  the  operatic world.  The dancing  is part of the victory celebrations by the Poles, and includes  three full length dances, a ""krakowiak"", a waltz, and  a mazurka.  As a ballet lover myself, I thoroughly enjoyed  this unusually long  inclusion  by members  of the Bolshoi Ballet on  the Bolshoi Theater stage -  the largest  stage in the world - specifically built to accommodate ballet performances.  The dances, interpreted by one of the two most famous Russian companies (the other being the Kirov in St. Petersburg), make this opera  more precious, not just to the opera lovers,  to the ballet enthusiasts as well.  What a treat!!!!!

  An opera which  I was very glad  to discover.",1380067200,9,3582,5.204626334519573
8074198,5,B000A3XZ0E,"I bought this DVD,because I had the Gorodetsky altered soviet era version from Naxos(1947),that it is very good,but it has not the  the true meaning of the deed of Susanin,that is to save the czar to free Russia from the Polish invader,and I was rewarded with another group of outstanding singers, being memorable the act IV,the dramatic one, with the splendid Elena Zaremba, Aleksandr Lomonosov and Yevgeny Nesterenko with one aria each. The one of Susanin(Nesterenko) was a mix of lament, funereal chant and defy to the enemy,truly moving ,in a way we could feel the sadness of a man that knows he is going to die,but feels it is the right thing to do,displaying the voice in a Rossinian way,with almost no music in long passages;that of Sobinin(Lomonosov)a voice wrecker,but the singer handled  easily all the high notes and that of Vanya(Zaremba),she  mastered her voice register with authority,sometimes it seemed a contralto,very dramatic,but never losing the youthful side of the voice. Truly a magnificient act in the old style. But also we should not forget Marina Mascheriakova, who sings a lovely cavatina in the first act. Also I would like to point that the act 2 being the Polish act, displayed a wonderful ballet,where they dance polonaise,krakowiak,waltz  and mazurka,truly a pleasure to the eyes and ears, being that way to reflect the confidence the Poles had in their power in Russia,enough so to dance and enjoy the life,like if in peace. It is noted the italian influence,but I believe that apart of  Rossini, it is the Bellini-Donizetti type of violin setting of several pieces what I heard. But overall,italian influence aside,it is a masterful piece that I consider a predecesor to The Maid of Orleans of Tchaikovsky,in the sense of a simple peasant doing an heroic deed for his/her country and king. At least in this that deed is recognized in the splendid final chorus. Truly, a treasure for every opera lover,that apreciates the art of acting with the voice. The costumes were sumptuous,and if the acting and the paintings can be old-fashioned to some people,what for me are not,you have to apreciate that the true story is in the singing,and singing we got,including the choruses,male and female,that I loved it. A real gem.",1313280000,,2252,4.994666666666666
8074199,5,B000A3XZ0E,"This opera has turned for me a tremendous surprise.  As every Russian, I knew of it;  it has been regularly performed in USSR under the title ""Ivan Susanin"", while of course everyone knew that its original name was ""The Life for the Tzar"".  The closing chorus in the epilogue was so famous that its image and music is forever blended with the image of the Soviet Atlantis.  That was what we all knew.

But what is amazing that this opera's music  is surely an attempt to  make a Russian opera in Rossini and Meyerbeer style - it is the first Grand Opera of Russia, thirty eight years before Boris Godunov by Mussorgsky, and operas by Tchaikovsky, Borodin and other Russian composers.  Thus what makes it unique is this somewhat bizarre scene of Russian muzhiks and babas (peasants) singing Rossini-like music!  For those who grew up on thinking that Russian school included pro-Russian group, with Mussorgsky as a leader, and pro-German group, led by Tchaikovsky, ""the Life for the Tzar"" by Glinka comes as a total surprise when heard in entirety.

One realizes that this opera, premiered in 1836, was done before anything Wagner, and therefore the major influence is by Rossini and Meyerbeer again.  It makes it so much more unique and interesting from the musical standpoint, because probably it is the only Russian opera written in this style, which could be called Russian Bel Canto.

Curiously, the events described in the opera follow the story of Boris Godunov, while ""Boris Godunov"" as an opera  was premiered in its entirety only in 1874.  Boris finishes with a scene of great uncertainty in Russia, with false Dimitry, who is also The Pretender and the former monk Grigory, in Poland courting Marina Mnishek.  Here in ""The Life for the Tzar"" Dimitry had already been overthrown and the first Tzar of Romanoff, the last dynasty of Russian Empire, has just been chosen Tzar.  Poles are enraged and are advancing on Moscow to remove the new Tzar.  To their ruin, they seize a peasant who is a serf, Ivan Susanin,  of the new Tzar, but they don't know it.  They order Ivan Susanin to escort them to the monastery where the Tzar stays at the moment.  Ivan Susanin, as a devoted servant and a patriot, leads the Poles to their death in the swamps, sacrificing his life for the Tzar.

Musically, it is again an astonishing piece.  It starts in a very traditional Russian style, resembling folk melodies - peasants are singing.  Then, with the arrival of the bride Antonida, Susanin's daughter, the style is changing to Rossini/Meyerbeer.  From that point on, the opera follows all the requirements of the genre of that day - it has elaborate arias for all voices, soprano (Antonida), tenor (Sobinin, the bridegrom), contralto (Vanya, the adopted son of Susanin), bass - (Susanin).  It has duets, one grandiose quartet in Act III between all the main characters,  and even one canon trio between Vanya, Antonida and Sobinin!  Act III finishes with an aria di bravura by Sobinin, completely in style of Verdi's great tenor aria ""Di quella pira"" from  ""Il Trovatore"". Even with the final brandishing the sword!!!  How could it be before Il Trovatore was even premiered twenty years later?  I think it is probably a standard piece for a heroic opera of the day.

Another notable scene in the Ballet at the beginning of Act II, in Polish headquarters  - it is in the form of Polonaise, just as in Boris Godunov Mussorgsky uses the same musical form for Polish court!  Here in Glinka's opera, however, the Ballet is very elaborate and takes about 10-15 minutes.

The music itself is no match to the genius of Rossini and great skill of Meyerbeer; it sounds nave, incredibly secondary to those masters and frequently flat.  But it is sung with phenomenal voices - Evgeny Nesterenko as Susanin is sensational, so is Vanya, sung by Elena Zaremba, a phenomenal contralto.  The tenor Alexander Lomonosov is also tremendous - as Manrico in ""Il trovatore"", he takes all the high C's effortlessly;  soprano Marina Mescheriakova is very good.  Those who loved ""Boris Godunov"" made in 1978 by Bolshoi will surely love Nesterenko in the role of Ivan Susanin in 1992.

Overall, it is a highly enjoyable performance and it is a must-hear for those interested in Russian opera and precursor of Russian opera as a whole, including operas by  Mussorgsky and Tchaikovsky.  I give it five stars for historical significance, excellent production and great voices; the music could be rated at three to four, but overall this is a very important performance.",1287446400,15,4534,4.836363636363636

8074201,4,B000A3XZ0E,"As one has come to expect from the Bolshoi, this opera was very well performed in a conventional version. Singing was very good as was the orchestra. Costumes and scenery were good, although the staging in places might be considered a bit static. The problem I had with it was that the musical content of the opera did not really justify it's three and a half hour length. There were a number of places where scenes (the ballet at the Polish ball, for example) were so drawn out that I found myself wishing they would end sooner.",1190937600,10,529,4.463917525773196
