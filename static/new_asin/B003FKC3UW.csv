8396003,5,B003FKC3UW,"I bought a VHS of this years ago when visiting the Liberace Museum in Nevada and have been looking for a DVD copy which doesn't seem to exist. This video is fascinating narrated by his sister-in-law, i.e. George's wife. The museum was three buildings and the video does a pretty good job of showing representative items of his clothing, cars, and jewelry. Unfortunately the museum no longer exists. I was hoping all those fascinating items would be saved and another Liberace Museum would open in Vegas, but I guess that's not going to happen. What a shame.",1499731200,,557,4.752577319587629
