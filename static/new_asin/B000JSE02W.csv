2678752,5,B000JSE02W,"I received Two-Step Volume One after I had wasted hundreds of dollars on other videos on the market so I already knew that Shawn's Trautman's tapes were the best there is on the market.

When I got this tape, just like the first one I was not disappointed. This tape was easy to follow just like the first one.  Shawn teaches in a way that even a first grader could learn from the tape but does it in a way that is exciting and fun to anyone.

I recommend this tape to anyone because Shawn and his wife's teaching method is the best way there is to learn to dance.

Hopefully this review will help someone not waste hundreds of dollars like I did on poor rated tapes.  I wish I would have had this information when I first started learning to dance and I would haved saved hundreds of dollars by buying Shawn's tapes first.",1164499200,6,823,4.25
2678753,5,B000JSE02W,This a fantastic series!! This dvd is actually pretty advanced. It's not hard but it goes into alot of detail. I can't wait for the next one! I feel like I know as much as the instructor at our club here. This will definitely put you in the driver's seat.,1164499200,4,255,4.12
2678754,5,B000JSE02W,"There are two good reasons to buy Shawn and Joanna Trautman's dance videos:  the explanations are clear and the moves look so cool!

The Trautmans break every move into simple parts and consolidate what they teach with repetition.  Leads and follows are clearly demonstrated.  Instead of two minute segments, each lesson is up to twenty minutes long and builds like a lesson at the studio.  No more hitting rewind over and over as you practice - just follow along in real time.

And the moves are combinations that look smooth and sophisticated together, a choreographed routine rather than just a collection of tricks.  It's the difference between mechanically walking through the steps and gliding through like a pro.

Now I know where the dancers I envy are learning their moves!",1164412800,4,782,4.961538461538462
8152793,2,B000JSE02W,Too difficult!!...I just learned the material in Two Step 101 which was great and then bought this dvd and found it overwhelming.  I have been doing the two step for 6 months and taken a dozen group lessons.  This video starts right off with a 4 or 5 part combination move.  Logically it would seem best to start off with a 2 part combination move and slowly progress from there.  I have been coaching sports for over 40 years and would never present material this difficult and call it intermediate.  Not much thought went into this dvd and as an educator I would grade them a D and I am being generous.,1445990400,,604,4.357142857142857
8152794,5,B000JSE02W,"We're already learning some great moves and loving the ability to rewind and play the instruction over when necessary. We were out on the dance floor for the first time recently and we looked pretty good with just what we've learned in lesson one!  This is the first time we've used a DVD program for dance instruction and there are some great benefits like being able to practice on your own schedule and not having to be embarrassed if you don't get it right away. We are beginners and this has helped us so much. The instruction is very clear, concise and filmed from a lot of different angles. The overall production quality (sound, visuals, etc) is top notch. Loving it. We've already watched it so many times that the Trautman's are like old friends. Worth every penny.",1398211200,,775,4.615942028985507
8152795,4,B000JSE02W,"I would have given it a 5, but the film is a little grainy so i gave it a 4. The Shawn Trautman series of dance instruction dvd's are by far the easiest to follow that i have found. He takes a nice easy pace to follow. He is clear, offers many good tips and shows the basic moves you will need to get dancing right away.",1366416000,,320,3.791044776119403
8152796,4,B000JSE02W,"I have to agree with other reviews and state that the video itself is a little grainy . That is why i am giving it a 4 instead of a 5. The Shawn Trautman series of dance instruction are by far the best series i've found. He speaks in a clear voice. The dance is done from several angles to show you the moves. The moves progress from in a nice order. He is easy to understand. I have purchased many other instruction dvd's , but would recommend this series over any of the others.",1366416000,,480,4.063157894736842
8152797,4,B000JSE02W,The beginning DVD are the best for beginners as the instructors are outstanding and do a good job for those who have not dance the Texas Two Step before.  It is very difficult to find DVD's that give a good explanation of the Texas Two Step.  You can't go wrong in buying this DVD.,1185408000,2,281,4.185185185185185
8152798,5,B000JSE02W,"My wife and I are new to ballroom dancing in the last year.  We've taken some lessons, but found that we needed the extra help of videos that we can use on our own schedule in our home and we've tried a bunch of them.  This DVD and the whole series of new videos from Shawn Trautman have been a godsend and much more useful to us than the others we've tried.  We are actually doing the dances within a short time and having fun, rather than getting aggravated with one another.  Trautman's emphasis on the differing roles of leader and follower and the very clear demonstrations of those roles have helped us enormously.  These DVDs include much more music and time to practice the new steps than most videos, rather than just watching an instructor do a step and go to another step.  We like this video a lot and strongly recommend it.  On a side note, the logistics/timing of shipping and subsequent email communications with the company were, after many frustrations with other online outfits, the best we've seen.",1165276800,,1017,4.585635359116022

8152800,5,B000JSE02W,"I HAVE TWO STEP VOL 1 AND 2, I THOUGHT THEY WERE GREAT.  I WAS WELL ON MY WAY DANCING.  THIS DVD IS FULL OF SURPRISES.  IT GOES INTO MANY MORE INCREDIBLE PATTERNS AND TURNS WHICH COMPLIMENT WHAT I HAVE ALREADY LEARNED.  THIS ONE IS A MUST HAVE!  SHAWN AND JOANNA MIXED THEM UP IN THE DANCE.  GET READY FOR MORE FUN!  INSTRUCTIONS AND FOOTWORK ARE JUST AWESOME.  THEY WENT ALL OUT ON THIS ONE!",1164758400,4,392,4.133333333333334
8152801,5,B000JSE02W,"I GOT VOLUME 1 TO LEARN HOW TO DO THE TWO STEP.

IT WAS SO MUCH FUN. THEN I GOT VOLUME 2 TO LEARN MORE.

THIS DVD IS JUST GREAT.IT'S REALLY COOL.IT HAS MANY TURNS.

LOTS OF HAND INSTUCTIONS. IT MAKES THE DANCE MORE BEAUTIFUL,

WITH LOTS OF VERY CLEAR AND EASY TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS.

I HAVE MANY OF SHAWN'S DVD'S HE MAKES DANCING SO MUCH FUN.

HAVING THE RIGHT TEACHER IS SO EMPORTANT.THIS ONE HAS IT ALL.",1164585600,4,406,4.141025641025641
8152802,5,B000JSE02W,"I had spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on learn to dance videos before I finally started receiving Shawn Truatman's videos.  I quickly realized all that early money had been wasted.  Shawn's tapes are the best there is.

I now have received his Two-Step for Beginners Volume One and Two and his Intermediate Two-Step Video.

The Beginner Tape Volume One starts out slow just for the person who has never danced before and then progresses on so even if you have some dancing experience you can still learn from the tape.

The Beginner Tape Volume Two picks up from there and progresses slowly into a more advanced level.

I recommend these tapes to anyone because the teaching method used by Shawn's tapes are done in a way that are easy to understand and makes it easy for any beginner to understand but at the same time someone who already has experience can learn from the tapes also.  The tapes are taught so well that I feel if a beginner looked at one of Shawn's more advanced tapes they could even learn from that.

Hopefully this review will help someone not waste hundreds of dollars like I did buying bad tapes.  I wish I would have had this information and I would have bought Shawn's tapes first and I would not have wasted all that money on bad tapes.",1164499200,5,1269,4.530701754385965
