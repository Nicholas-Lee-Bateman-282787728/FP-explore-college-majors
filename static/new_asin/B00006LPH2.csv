7972079,5,B00006LPH2,"This a great movie!!!  After I watched it a few times, I really though to myself that it could be the way a lot of IPO companies went down the drain!!  The actors were very natural, and there was a great plot.  It's hard to find this movie, but  please try!!!",1507680000,,259,4.019607843137255
7972080,4,B00006LPH2,I laughed and I was also confused while watching this movie. It was still entertaining and worth watching especially if you are in the digital marketing/eCommerce field,1437609600,,168,5.2592592592592595
7972081,5,B00006LPH2,"""Dot"" is a hilarious, independent film that was made during the dotcom bust. How funny that we are now back in another startup-obsessed era, though not as bubble burst-y as it was in 2000. ""Dot"" is a parody of the fact that so many startups have zero product and tons of hubris. It skewers the culture of the ego, and it seems even more timely than it was when it was created because of the rise of Facebook and Twitter, platforms that seem to feed upon people's egos and narcissism.

""Dot"" is a ""This is Spinal Tap"" mockumentary following the rise and hysterical fall of a zany dotcom company and its funny cast of character. The best actor and character is director Simeon Schnapper's CEO, who looks and acts exactly like John Belushi. It's pretty uncanny.

""Dot"" isn't trying to make any statements or be political but it happens to make perfect sense for the zeitgeist. If you've ever met anyone in technology who is self-important, pompous and thinks they're creating something great but really, they're just creating another crappy website like MySpace that will go away in a few short years, you'll enjoy the slings and arrows of ""Dot.""

And if you happen to BE one of those folks in technology, if you have a sense of humor, you'll be able to laugh and recognize a lot of archetypes. It's a very funny, and gentle, spoof. Nothing mean or snarky in this mockumentary.",1343865600,,1374,4.622950819672131
7972082,5,B00006LPH2,"If you were around and remember the internet boom of the late '90s, this movie is definitely for you! Whether you participated in the explosion of the stock market or not, or mainly was just a bystander, this movie will have you rolling on the floor laughing so hard you'll forget how painful it was when the market corrected and how much money you might have lost.  The satire is so dead-on, the performances of the actors are so REAL and believable, and the script a work of perfection you'll find yourself laughing just as hard when watching this enjoyable movie for the upteenth time.  If you like satirical movies with excellent performances and timely writing, rent this movie today.  You won't regret it!  (Just thinking about this movie again has me in stitches.)",1107216000,2,771,4.731343283582089
7972083,5,B00006LPH2,"This is a fantastic mocumentry that satirizes the dot com explosion of the late nineties.  Having absolutely no product, no business plan, no money, and no ability or desire to succeed, three friends quit their jobs and start a company that is ""the solution for e-tomorrow.""  It is a sardonic take on the young know-nothings that started and failed most of the dot com businesses in the latter nineties.  By scamming seed money out of friends, family, and a series of venture capitalists (called angels) this little nothing of a company plods along for a few months with each character displaying profound incompetence.

The founders of zectec.com, which like most things ""doesn't really mean anything,"" love all the buzz words and use them liberally but have absolutely no clue what they mean or how to apply them.  Their business plan was based on discarded business plans found in the garbage by Si, the main character.  They throw care to the wind when spending on fine clothes, cars, and consultants, with little care for the product.  They want to ""make the most amount of money in the shortest amount of time with the least amount of effort.""  The goal, of course, is the IPO; however, there is no product and there never will be a product.  The discussion on the equity structure alone is a classic.  Excellent documentary style with a ton of subtleties discovered with multiple viewings.  Each scene opens with a pan shot of the expense ledger with absolutely hilarious detail along with a cash balance snapshot.  In one word these characters are ""dicey.""  Great stuff!",1094256000,2,1578,4.865168539325842
7972084,5,B00006LPH2,"Extremely funny and well thought out.  Hysterical even for people not familiar with the Internet.  Ross is my favorite character; he is the only one who could admit the reality of the company's situation, one that was started by two people whose major concern is an open smoking policy.  The music and editing are excellent.  Lyrics like ""Fat Ass Pool with a Dollar Sign"" streamed through my head for weeks after the showing.  I will be very excited to see the never seen before footage.",1036108800,,487,4.682352941176471
7972085,5,B00006LPH2,"I saw Dot at a friends house a while back. A tape of this movie had been making its way around NY for a while. Believe it or not, there's actually a small cult following for this film. It used to be called Dotcom Hot Tubs, Pork Chops and Valium. Which is funnier. I know a dozen people who can quote lines from this movie.
Yes it's true, I worked at a dot com company. But the dot com aspect of the movie is just one part of it. What's really funny are the characters. I hope these actors get seen because they are all just great.
If you want to own a really funny movie that gets better and better with each viewing, you're going to want to buy this.",1035849600,3,651,3.9770992366412212
7972086,4,B00006LPH2,"- Let me be blunt -- having spent the past year of my life working at an Internet company, so I know all about these character types.  The under- appriciated supporting cast deserves full recognition for carrying this movie.  They were the true spirit of the film.  But I have only seen this movie once . The over bloated lead character, Simoen, is not acting but rather supporting the film on the money he has stolen from his previous job.  The scenes that I missed the most are when Simoen's character is a ""practicing Buddhist"", steals money from his company, never works and yet has time to do cocaine (with money he has conned out of people), and slept with half the staff which are not pictured in the movie.  What a missed ending - I wish I could see how it would of turned out. Could there be any VD or STDs. I know that fans will love seeing the surprise ending of this small endowed character (simeon) feeling trapped by all the people he taken to the bank.  Remember folks this is just a movie - it is not like this guy (simoen) knows how to be an actor - this is just his nature.  The moral of the movie is always watch your wallet when talking to Simoen - you know he is!  And he will always take credit for your work - what a lazy sad character.  Thank god this is just a Movie - or is it?? Can't wait for a sequel in LA.  I hope Simoen character knows how to use people out there.  I really hope so - he is perfect in LA LA land.  Invest in acting classes. Changing the name of the movie doesn't erase your sins - that's what I learned.  Enjoy the movie . . .",1035504000,,1574,4.087947882736156
7972087,5,B00006LPH2,"DOT is simply the most well created and performed indie I have
had the pleasure of seeing in years. It is fresh, funny and well
acted. Simeon Schnapper takes the audience to the limitations of
humor and beyond. I am very excited about being able to own a copy.
I have been telling friends about the film since the first time I saw it during the Sundance Film Festival last year.
If you have not seen the film, buy it! If you have seen the film,
I know that you have already placed an order.
Congratulations to the innovative film makers, cast and crew.
