1669030,4,B00005UQEU,This is a great movie to see on a wet rainy day when you need a chuckle.  It has the right mix of wierd situations that are an ideal setting for the humour.,1013472000,,156,3.727272727272727
1669031,1,B00005UQEU,"This is uncomfortable drivel.  O look, of course it's funny to some extent - Gerard Derpadieu mouths off homophobic abuse, not once but repeatedly, and his derision is (surprise, surprise) a shield against his own inclinations - yes, you will laugh, but essentially this same joke is repeated a dozen times, by which time you might well have ceased laughing; then Gerard has some kind of mental breakdown, and mental illness is, in the best Hollywood tradition, a source of much merriment.  This cliche is typical of the entire film - other examples: if you need a villain, make sure you cast a foreigner (thus Daniel Auteuil's ex-wife is Dutch); to sustain a plot you must have an implausibly successful romance (I think the writer consulted 'Revenge of the Nerds' for some plot tips here); the cliches surrounding homosexuality are also deployed relentlessly, and reflex and habit will have you laughing along with the rest of the audience, at least for a while - just don't think too much about why you are laughing, 'don't think too much' being, I suppose, a worthy motto for most present-day popular cinema.  Personally, I wish that I'd contented myself with viewing the trailer and giggling at the poster featuring Daniel Auteuil wearing an oversized condom - the film itself adds little to these pleasures.",1011484800,5,1313,4.932126696832579
1669032,5,B00005UQEU,"Le Placard is an interesting hybrid: a French farce (but not as racy as most), a sophisticated screwball comedy of the pre-WWII mode (except more ribald), and a ""message"" film (about how our prejudices against gays distort how we think of homosexuals and of others we mistakenly think are gay).  The film brings all of these elements together with a light touch, so even those people disinclined to agree with its message will find themselves laughing at the crazy antics.  The filmmakers understood that if Le Placard was not to be like one of those sappy but ""humorous"" Robin Williams' message movies, the humor had to be what would drive the film, and this motion picture delivers the comedy in spades.  It is one of the best new comedies I've seen in a while.",1010966400,3,763,4.67910447761194
1669033,3,B00005UQEU,"The writer and director who brought us La Cauge Au Folles and the recent comic cult hit;  The Dinner Game, now delivers the Closet.
The Closet is one of the most tasteful politically incorrect French farces I've seen.  Everything is being delivered with such a gentle touch, it's hard to believe this is the same director who delivered the funny but mean spirited Dinner Game.  The film is a little stronger than a television sit-com, but not much. It's an easy film to like--too easy.
The Closet stars four of Frances most popular home grown box-office stars and was a huge hit there in late 2000.  It arrived in U.S. theaters in 2001.
I laughed quite a bit during the Closet, but as I was watching I also knew the film could have been much better.  There were a lot of missed opportunities and with the cast involved it would have taken a real effort to completely fail to entertain.  I appreciated the decision not to go completely sappy with some of the twists the story took and I think the film is a far better than something like In and Out to whom it's distantly related.
Mild mannered, milquetoast, almost invisible Francois Pignon  (Daniel Auteuil) works as an accountant in a condom factory.  He's such a non-entity when there's no room for him in the company picture he sits it out. He's such a nice dull guy, even the most gregarious guy at the company has stopped playing practical jokes on him.
Then Francois overhears the gregarious guy Felix Santini (Gerard Depardieu) and his friend Guillaume (Thierry Lhermitte) laughing about the fact that Fancois was about to be fired.  Will anyone even notice?
It's the last straw for Francois whose wife left him almost a year ago (though he still loves her) Francois' teenage son avoids him whenever possible, he has no hobbies, or friends  and without a job, he'll be unable to give his wife alimony.  He  contemplates committing suicide.

His new neighbor, Belone (Michel Aumont) however be-friends him.  He is retired corporate psychologist and he has a plan to help keep his job.  Using some doctored photos, Belone, creates a rumor at the factory that Francois is gay.  Fearing there could be bad publicity from the gay community which would hurt condom sales, the company can't fire Francois now. Francois boss, the beautiful Mlle. Bertrand (Michele Laroque) is not only suspicious that something doesn't add up, but she's also suddenly intrigued by Francois.
Francois long string of bad luck and dullness has come to an end.
Everyone's attitude toward  the former invisible employee suddenly changes. Even gregarious homophobe Felix is being nice to him for some reason. Of course complications crop up, but the film is utterly predictable with its twists.
The film is tame in tone and the humor pretty gentle. The direction from a visual standpoint is totally lackluster - though comic timing is sharp.  It's really the charisma and skill of the actors (Daniel Auteuil here acts like a French speaking Tony Randall,) that makes this film as successful and funny as it is. They make it worth watching.
DVD STUFF
The Closet is presented in anamorphic widescreen with  2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The colors are sharp and very little grain, dirt or print damage is visible.  The black levels seems to be very strong.
The soundtrack is clean and free from any distortion or noise.  There's not a lot of sound effects or even appropriate occasions which would use the full spectrum of a home surround system, but the music and ambient noises  are well distributed to create a natural sounding environment. We've all seen foreign films where everyone talks in strange hollow disembodied and over-modulated voices.  That is not the case here.  The film is in French and the English subtitles are very easy to read.
DVD EXTRAS:
Little is here but three theatrical trailers.
BOTTOM LINE:
The Closet is an amusing clever French comedy that delivers enjoyable performances.  It should have been better than it is, but if you are looking for something a little different and in the mood to laugh it's certainly worth a look.  If you're put off by subtitles (which are very easy to read on this DVD) then that's you're loss.
3 1/2 stars.  It's funny but could have and should have been better.

1669040,4,B00005UQEU,"Just over eighty minutes in length, LE PLACARD manages to say more about entrenched attitudes towards sexuality and prejudice in the workplace than many weightier pieces.

The plot is straightforward enough: Franois Pignon (Daniel Auteuil) is about to be made redundant from an accounting position at a rubber plant due to his essentially colorless personality. He encounters his next-door neighbor Belone (Michel Aumont), a retired industrial psychologist, who advises Franois to publicly announce his homosexuality, even though Franois is in truth heterosexual. The accountant's fortunes change immediately: fearful of the possible scandal involved, his boss reverses the redundancy decision and lionizes Franois instead. Homophobic personnel officer and rugby coach Flix (Grard Depardieu) is forcibly told to cut down on the insults and be nice to Franois; in the end Flix falls in love with him. Flix's son Franck (Stanislas Crevilln), who once considered his father boring and refused to see him, now makes every effort to restore their relationship.

While Francis Veber's comedy has a considerable degree of wish- fulfillment about it, the director nonetheless makes some sharp points about the ways in which people judge purely on appearances. Franois's co-workers Mlle. Bertrand (Michle Laroque) and Christine (Alexandra Vandernoot) immediately assume that they understood his sexuality all along through his ""tight-assed"" manner of walking. Flix's two rugby-playing buddies beat Franois up in a garage, suspecting him of pedophile tendencies. Meanwhile Kopel, Franois's boss (Jean Rochefort) automatically assumes that Franois will participate in a Gay Pride march, because ""that's what you people do.""

The film also criticizes other gender assumptions - for example, that rugby players are all aggressively macho with homophobic impulses. The grunt and grind of the scrum inevitably prevents them from being gay themselves. Likewise Franois proves to be a better father when he pretends to be gay, compared to his heterosexual past, which says a lot about society's assumptions about what a ""true"" parent should do.

Such points are made in a light-hearted manner, with a script that positively sparkles with one-liners. Depardieu is especially droll as the rugby-playing dope who discovers his homosexual tendencies and learns how to live with them, even if it takes a spell in a psychological unit for him to do so.",1468886400,,2429,5.556756756756757

1669047,5,B00005UQEU,"Matt Groening (of The Simpsons fame) once noted this paradox:  the French are funny;  sex is funny;  comedies are funny.  Why, then, are French sex comedies not funny?  Here's an exception, although it's not really a sex comedy, more of a gender-twisting farce.  The plot is simple:  an accountant nobody really cares about is about to lose his job, so he pretends to be gay so the company, fearful of being hit with a discrimination lawsuit, won't fire him.  Hilarity ensues.  Daniel Auteuil is great as the accountant, Gerard Depardieu is a believably oafish executive, and Michele Laroque is splendid as the accountant's supervisor.  Francis Veber wrote and directed;  he also wrote the screenplay for 'La Cage aux Folles'.",1433721600,,726,5.016806722689076

1669056,4,B00005UQEU,"Very amusing film - I loved it.
I am a big fan of both Auteuil and Depardieu having seen them both in the Paris theatre here in NY in the 80s in Jean de Florette.

This film could easily be dismissed as 'fluff' and perhaps it is, but it was very cute and I had a lot of fun with it.",1399852800,,282,3.622950819672131
1669057,4,B00005UQEU,"As a fan of farce and in particular, french farce, I've been looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while now. It turned out to be both less and more than expected. There is a good deal more heart than in the typical farce - delivered for the most part by Daniel Auteuil in the lead playing the Pretend Secretly Gay man and Michel Aumont as the Actually Gay neighbor. (I find it odd that Daniel in the title role isn't even listed in the cast by Amazon, by the way.)  There are far fewer laughs than in your typical farce as well - I counted two - you'll find yourself smiling gently more often than not.

The cast of characters is fairly predictable. You have the Attractive Co-worker, the What Did He See In Her Ex-wife, the Self-absorbed Teenaged Son, the Manipulative Co-workers, the Brutish Co-workers, and the Clueless Homophobe (who is actually a good guy and experiences a neck snapping change of heart, played by the ever lovable Grard Depardieu), all played to perfection by an all star cast. Daniel in particular plays the Downtrodden Everyman, Fancois, to perfection - he gets no respect from anyone in his life even though he's spent his life being a good husband, father and employee. It is only the advent of a new neighbor/friend into his life who encourages Francois to break free from his self imposed cycle of allowing people to walk all over him and then feeling sorry for himself as a result. The neighbor is played with a sweet soulfulness by Michel Aumont, he alone is worth the price of admission.

I'm not going to repeat the entire plot here, but I will say there were actually two things I found disturbing about this movie. First, and most importantly, there is a fairly significant incident of gay bashing by two of the lead character's co-workers. Not only did it feel out of place in the overall tone of the movie, there were no consequences whatsoever as a result.. I, for one, would have expected them to be arrested at some point, or at least fired. Their ""retribution"" amounts to being shoved to the ground by Francois, their victim. And that's it. It didn't seem quite fair after breaking a collarbone. More importantly, however, it downplays a serious issue - violence against gays.

My second issue with the movie is that apparently either in France, the year 2001 when this was made, or in the director's mind, bisexuality doesn't exist. Like, at all. The entire point of the movie is ""Is he or Isn't he"" concerning Francois' sexuality, with absolutely no one considering the obvious third option, that he doesn't have a preference. The bisexual community seems to be virtually invisible in the minds of far too many people, although this is thankfully changing. Yes, I do realize this is just a light comedy, but still.

Overall I'd recommend this movie mostly for the exceptionally fine top to bottom acting and likeable characters and not for the predictable and sometimes questionable plot. I would have liked to seen more quirkiness - I can suspend disbelief better than most - and less gay bashing but it was not to be.",1398988800,,3073,4.662361623616236
1669058,5,B00005UQEU,"This movie is very funny. It has so many little details that make one laugh. French comedy at it's best. Daniel Auteuil and Gerard Depardieu at their best !!! Feeling low, watch this movie.",1398124800,,189,4.588235294117647
1669069,5,B00005UQEU,"This movie was an unexpected delight, so funny that my sides hurt from laughing. This movie does the best job I've seen making fun of our politically correct and neurotic culture. I shouldn't have been surprised that this movie is French -- I think we Americans would be afraid to make a movie that examines these issues so unabashedly. All of the characters are loveably lured into behaving in ways that defy logic, all in the name of making sure that the right ""attitude"" is on display at all times. The scene with the pink rubber hat in the parade is worth the price of the movie all by itself -- I will resist spoiling the hilarious plot by saying more.",1389312000,,657,4.43801652892562

Then Gerard Depardieu nailed it; I've never seen him so funny. If this had been made in Hollywood it probably would have been disatrously crude but the French know how to do this just right.  I found myself laughing out loud at things I'd never think I would---like the scene with Auteuil wearing a condom on his head like a bonnet. Sounds awful, doesn't it...but it really is hilarious.  There's even an adorable kitten. See it.",1369958400,,599,4.6761904761904765

This is on my top-10 list, and it is probably the funniest, best-written comedy I have ever seen.  It starts with a man in a completely miserable situation who turn his life around by pretending to be something he is not.  It's an object lesson on the pitfalls of people pleasing and the virtues of standing up for yourself.  Also, it's a great send up of the western world's business culture, political correctness and confused attitudes toward sexuality.

For the clever, worldly viewer this film is an absolute gem.  After seeing it, you'll never look at a ""prservatif""--or Gerard Depardieu--the same way again.",1361145600,3,763,4.742424242424242

SOME SPOILERS:

Pignon is an accountant at a condom factory. He learns that he is going to be fired soon and is consumed by sadness. He has lived a quiet life where seldom anyone notices him, not even his own teenage son.

In his grief he decides to end it all but is interrupted mid jump (off his balcony) by his neighbor who claims that if he jumps he will ruin his car! Let me say this alone got me hooked! I was laughing so hard that I couldn't see!

Eventually the neighbor and Pignon come up with a plan to save his job. They pretend that Pignon is gay. Being a condom factory that gets much of its business from the gay and lesbian community, his boss is unable to fire him.

The story continues with some of France's biggest stars (Depardieu, for instance)and the mixture is pure genius! If you are a fan of any French comedies (ComDads, La Cage of Aux Folles and most recently The Valet), you will love The Closet!",1325721600,,1170,4.373271889400922

This movie made me laugh outloud and remember why I loved French comedies growing up.  I think they are way underrated here in the U.S. in lieu of stupid romantic comedies and ""comedic"" trash which is vulgar toilet humor and lower-common-denominator pie-in-the face humor.

The Closet was funny and witty and most of all engaging.  The audience gets pulled into the characters' lives and are taken on a journey through their ups and downs.

However, I did feel a bit uneasy about a few gay slurs that were casually tossed around by several of the characters (including those characters that were supposed to be sympathetic). I can't help but think that the script would be adjusted a bit today---this was made over ten years ago, after all. And even for a light comedy, this isn't perfect---I would have liked to see a few of the sub-plots developed to a greater degree. Also, I would have liked to see the one openly gay character have more of a social life, for goodness sake.

His ex-wife and son want nothing to do with him, just keep the checks coming please, and he's so colorless, he's already the invisible man at work.  But, with the aid of his neighbor Belone, played by the veteran French actor Michel Aumont (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Woman-in-Blue/dp/B00008K797/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Woman in Blue</a>), Pignon cooks up the tale that he is homosexual, thereby preventing his employers from discharging him, due to anti-discrimination legislation.  Felix Santini, a macho coworker who harasses Pignon until he begins to worry about his own job safety, is played by the wonderful Gerard Depardieu (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Card/dp/B00008977F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Card</a>).

The movie is set in modern-day Paris, but largely in its suburbs and office parks, which we don't really get to see very often over here.  People live in apartment blocks, and drive cars; office parks have parking lots.  It's nicely filmed, and gives us an interesting world.  Plus, it's warm, charming, and funny, though extremely light, and funniest the first time around.  But it's utterly conventional at heart.  There's no doubt that, somewhat disappointingly, it actually puts credence in the sexual stereotypes it's been kidding: but, hey, it's a comedy, and a funny one.",1264464000,,2148,6.718411552346571
1669138,5,B00005UQEU,"""It's the eyes of the beholder"". Yes, sure, but does it matter?
Franois Pignon seems to be able to do nothing well in life. Until, by
an accident of fate, and a bright neighbour, formerly an enterprise
psychologist, they find out how to avoid the bad news, get to know
who's who in his family and work colleagues, and get the reins of his
own life, which seemed to be a robot's.

Michel Aumont is a fantastic actor, so natural it makes you tremble.
Without him, the film just wouldn't exist. Yes, Auteuil is also fine as
a likable looser. When he ""squints like a gay"", he really does
something ... unusual. Like on a Rorschach test, it just takes an
ambiguous image for us viewers to project who we really are. The
envious co worker, the racist macho, the brainy one who plays with
other people's feelings like if they were chess pieces, the bright
beautiful competitive blonde which rightly suspects from the start, the
boss who wields power but just doesn't want trouble, the bright African
who also has mixed feelings about the white majority, his stunning but
sour & selfish ex wife, their aloof frivolous teenager, in short, the
human comedy. Balzac would be proud.

Pignon, like his neighbour's kitten, is probably too grey to be
distinguishable from most people we know. If there's something
reassuring in this comedy that takes place at a fake condom factory is
that we could all change. If only ...

Veber, director of ""The dinner game"" and of lesser works, is at his
best here.

While stereotypes abound, they are probably forced upon us to make the
""clockwork orange"" of gags work relentlessly. At that it succeeds
admirably.

Pure enjoyment!

1669151,4,B00005UQEU,"The premise of this movie is that a competent but quiet and unexciting accountant (Pignon) is getting fired for no particular reason except someone has to go and he's considered expendable, being something of a zero in the eyes of his employer and coworkers.  The opening scene says it all when he willingly is omitted from the annual company photo of the staff: he will not be missed by anyone.  Pignon is very depressed and considering ending it all when his new neighbor on the adjoining balcony intervenes.  The neighbor has an idea to help him: he should pretend he's gay and then his employer will be too concerned about ""correctness"" to fire him -- they'll bend over backwards to pretend they're not prejudiced.  The neighbor (a retired industrial psychologist) doctors up some photos with the head of the accountant (Pignon) and the bodies of some gays entering a gay night club.  These are sent anonymously to Pignon's boss, and quickly are photocopied and spread throughout the company.  The president quickly decides it would be a very bad strategy to fire Pignon, because these days, they wouldn't want to alienate the gay market, particularly since they make condoms.

It sounds like a thin one-joke movie, but the actors are good enough that it's quite amusing and doesn't drag.  Gerard Depardieu (a very funny guy) plays Santini, the captain of the company rugby team who is aggressively heterosexual and makes disparaging remarks about gays constantly.  He's warned that he better buddy up to Pignon (by coworkers who are basically playing a joke on him) or else he'll get fired.  Subplots involve Pignon's relationship with his ex-wife and estranged son.  There is a very funny scene of Pignon in a gay pride parade.

The whole film is made less obnoxious by an episode involving gay-bashing (violent) that makes it clear that the subject is really rather serious, even if the film is funny.",1118966400,5,1908,4.909657320872274

Daniel Auteuil plays a boring, dull, and mostly overlooked man who is ignored by his family (ex wife and son), ignored or seen as useless at work, and basically has no personality or terribly redeeming qualities that can be seen.

Happily, his neighbor has a great talent for invention and sends a photo to Auteuil's character Pignon's office revealing him to be gay and something of a ""wild man"" outside of work. Naturally Pignon won't be fired now that his employer thinks he is gay; this will be seen as ostracizing and divisive and prejudiced, singling him out for his sexual orientation. The events that take place after Pignon's ""outing"" are farcical, comical and hilarious. Auteuil is a versatile actor, easily at home in comedy or drama, as is his co-star, Gerard Depardieu. Both handle their roles well. In the course of Pignon's ""coming out"" Pignon actually discovers a great deal about himself and his life changes unalterably.",1110758400,5,1101,4.893048128342246

It all begins in a condom manufacturing plant with a boring accountant (Daniel Auteuil) who overhears from a bathroom stall that he will be fired from his position. Upon returning home he informs his ex-wife and son of his pending predicament and vows to find another job in order to keep them in alimony. He meets a new neighbor (Michel Aumont) who convinces him not to jump from his balcony and the fun soon begins. Together they concoct a story to save his job believing that if he can convince his company that he is really gay he will save his position by suggesting a prejudice exists. The company sends its dogs out to fend off any chance of a lawsuit and uses the services of its most macho employee (Gerard Depardieu) to ""romance"" away any perceived distaste for the new discovery. From here the story spins and weaves into a web of hilarious lies that will have you rolling on the floor in laughter.

This film is so well written and easy to follow that the sub-titles are easily accepted by even the most English of all English speakers. While some of the references in this film might be taken harshly by those of the gay persuasion it is really only a lighthearted stab at all of the stereotypes that lurk within a corporate existence. Boring accountants could also take offense for that matter! Auteuil is fantastic as the bumbling lead, Depardieu is never better as the macho man who eventually finds his true passion, Aumont wonderful as the helpful neighbor with a few secrets of his own, the incomparable Jean Rochefort adds his own brand of humor to the film cast as the company CEO and the cast just continues into a complete brilliance.

1669175,4,B00005UQEU,"I enjoyed Francis Veber's 'The Closet' - released in France in 2001 - for two reasons.  First, it features an all-star ensemble of French acting, certainly a tribute to Veber's skill as a director.  Just take a gander at the first six names to appear on the IMDB credits:

Daniel Auteuil ....  Franois Pignon

Grard Depardieu ....  Flix Santini

Thierry Lhermitte ....  Guillaume

Michle Laroque ....  Mlle Bertrand

Michel Aumont ....  Belone, the neighbour

Jean Rochefort ....  Kopel, the director

Imagine a movie where the great Jean Rochefort gets slotted sixth.  Each of these six stars can carry a movie in France on their own back.  The fact that the group has teamed here is a testament to Veber's reputation.  His previous release, 1998's 'The Dinner Game,' was lauded far and wide as a comedic masterpiece.  Actors get attracted to that type of skill.

The second reason I got a kick out of watching 'The Closet':  I just learned that 'Bend It Like Beckham' writing partners Gurinder Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges are prepping a UK re-make for the screen for a targeted 2006 release, with Chadha at the helm.  Her keen eye for comedy tinged with poignancy was confirmed by Beckham's runaway success, so I feel like I'm in on a really great secret knowing she's working on a re-make.",1095638400,3,1294,4.760180995475113

He finds, while in the bathroom from the chief of personnel (Gerarad Depardieu)that he will be laid off. Depardieu is also the coach of the company rugby team, a homophobic macho maniac.

He does not change anything in his life. His words, his actions, are exactly the same, but the reactions of everybody in his life to him change dramatically. His ex-wife, (Alexandra Vandernoot from The Dinner Game) who won't even take his calls, now answers the phone.

Yes, the last two Hollywood outings are actually remakes of his works, and though not all of his films are masterpieces, ""The Closet"" alone would make you remember his name.  This film is that funny.
Daniel Auteuil is M. Pignon, who has been working for a condom factory as an accountant for 20 years, now he happens to learn that he is going to be fired.  Shocked by the news, he thinks of jumping from the window to kill himself when an old man living in the next room gives a tip; ""pretend you're gay.""  For political reasons (and commercial ones too) the company cannot fire him as they are afraid of being accused of having discriminating attitudes.  It succeeds, and M. Pignon is happy ... for a while.
Because unexpected things happen like chain reaction; ""sexual harrassment"" from his beautiful female boss (she has her own reason), sexual advance from his co-worker and rugby coach (he has his own reason, too), and so on.  The story goes on with twists and turns, finally leading to the confidence newly established in M. Pignon.
Though the ending is not as good as it should be, and some parts are a bit incredible, the cast is so great that those flaws are all ignored in the end.  Daniel Auteuil's dead-pan humor is always effective, and funniest is his face when he is in a parade wearing a huge tip of condom on his head.  Also humorous is Gerard Depardieu, whose character experiences a total transformation.
""The Closet"" has some satire on our attitude about sexuality, but it doesn't preach them.  Rather, the film handles them with a lighter tough, which avoids the pitfall of being too gloomy or philosophical.  The fact is, the film is too light for some; and clearly the director hesitates to push some interesting points the film presents.  But ""The Closet"" should be about M. Pignon, who, just like the protagonist of the same name in ""The Dinner Game,"" is about Mr. Everyman.  His journey to a new life is what we see, and we enjoy watching.

Still I would recommend this movie -- but in third place after ""La Cage"" and ""Dinner Game.""",1030579200,,582,4.504761904761905
1669208,4,B00005UQEU,"""Le Placard"" (The Closet), from the creators of the highly acclaimed ""Dinner Game"", is a perfect balance of high farce and social voyeurism delivered with true Gallic pathos. Daniel Auteuil and Gerard Depardieu are perfectly cast in this terrifically funny look into the change in the life of a boring man who becomes the office celebrity after ""coming out"". The film starts with Francois Pignon (Auteuil) facing dismissal from his job. His workmates, his estranged wife and son all ignore him and he is on the verge of ending it all when a new neighbor (Michel Aumont) fortuitously arrives on the scene and tries to save Pignon. He hatches a plan to ""expose"" the straight Pignon to his workmates in order to engender sympathy and put fear into the minds of those who would fire him. Depardieu is brilliant as the homophobic personnel manager, Santini, who finds himself having to bow and scrape to the now- highly-esteemed Pignon. Unbeknownst to Santini, he has been set up. The office rumour mill is in overdrive and one cannot help but observe the obvious social references of this beautifully constructed little gem. I got more belly laughs from this film than any I've seen in years and whilst it's not exactly Ibsen, it belongs on any ""must see"" list.",1028764800,10,1257,4.824074074074074
1669209,5,B00005UQEU,"Who is Francois Pignon?
He is a character that Francis Veber has used in many of his films, from La Chevre to the excellent Diner Des Cons, and he appears again in his latest Le Placard/The Closet.
Pignon is always a lonely man, separated or divorced, with no friends or social life,accident prone,in short down on his luck, an average man living a dull existence, and invariably an oddity in a society that applauds people with good looks, and success professionally and socially..The very type of people that look down at Pignon and make fun of him..Hero vs anti Hero.
This is Francois Pignon and Veber's character in the films should be looked at in this context, regardless if one film is funnier than the other.
Certainly Diner Des Cons is funnier than Closet, and if you expect the same laughs then you will look at Veber's latest with less enthusiasm, and appreciate it less. Veber did not intend to repeat the same formula he used in Diner Des Cons, but give us a story about another Pignon, in a different context and situation.
There is more poignancy in the Closet,and it is a bittersweet comedy, like the French can only make.
The pretext of pretentious gayness to keep his job, is only a backdrop to Pignon's predicament at the hand of society, but it is a very clever insight nevertheless, into the corporate atmosphere and political correctness vs homophobia.
Yet what I found very interesting about the gay angle, is how Pignon discovers a strenght and confidence he never thought he had by pretending to be gay. The way his colleagues and family react to him, from ridicule, to excessive friendliness, to pride, (from his own son, thinking it is very cool), is very interesting.

The acting I though was very good. Assembling some of the best French working actors today , including Depardieu, Rochefort, Lhermitte and of course Auteuil.
He plays Pignon in a straight faced manner..but not boring as some reviewer saw it, because his performance reflects so well the character he is playing. All Pignons are boring! Whereas in Diner Des Cons, Pignon had the gift of talking! even in the wrong moments, saying the wrong things, and entertaining the viewer in the process, Pignon of Closet had deep anxieties, and he shows them.
The beauty about Francois Pignon is that he triumphs at the end. He saves the day..manages to make people happy, or clear the mess he put himself or others in, becoming the most unlikely hero. and this is Veber's triumph and with it The Closet.
It is a wonderful film, that I hope Hollywood will not remake, because all Veber's american remakes,(Three Fugitives, The Toy, Birdcage) even the ones he directed himself, lose their magic,
the magic of Francois Pignon.",1025827200,7,2708,4.786324786324786
1669210,4,B00005UQEU,"Although Daniel Auteuil does his usual excellent character portrayal in this film, as an accountant who pretends to be gay to save his job with a condom manufacturer, it is Gerard Depardieu who steals the film. Depardieu plays a homophobic colleage who first schemes to get him fired and then seeks to engratiate himself with Auteuil in order to save his own job.  I like this film better than this director's ""The Dinner Party."" For one, the other film has no counterpart to the hilarious Depardieu, found only in ""The Closet."" Director Francis Veber can deliver with French comedies and that genre needs a resurrection from its glory days of the 1970s.

1669211,3,B00005UQEU,"To be sure, Francis Verber has talent. With the wildly funny ""Dinner Game"", he showed that he was able to weave hilarious situational comedy. Unfortunately, ""The Closet"" does not pick up where ""The Dinner Game"" left off. There's nothing awful about it, but in a failed attempt to put a new spin on Verber's creation Francois Pignon, ""The Closet"" never delivers.
Francois Pignon (Daniel Auteuil) is considered an idiot by many who work with him at a condom factory and is on the verge of being fired. He gets word of this, and dismayed turns to his new neighbor Belone (Michel Aumont). Belone suggests a tricky scheme to save Pignon's job: pretend that he is gay and the company will never fire him if they want to save their image. The scheme is working, and on the other side of the spectrum there is another prank being played. Homophobe Felix Santini (Gerard Depardieu) is being pressured to act nice to Pignon to save his job, and unexpected things begin to happen.
Francois Pignon is one of the funnier characters I have encountered in recent years. In Verber's previous film he was a flat-out idiot, meaning well but always saying the wrong things and the wrong times. In ""The Closet"", everyone calls him an idiot, but I don't buy it. He seems perfectly intelligent to me. Pignon is translated here as a boring punch line without the setup. Much to my surprise, I found that I couldn't care less what happens to him over the course of the film. One of the most valuable pieces of advice I could give to Verber from an audience member's perspective is: if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Only partly because of Pignon's shortcomings does the film fall flat. Most of the jokes just aren't funny. They're the same sort of recycled gay jokes we get all the time in movies. The screenplay feels worn and tired, and what could've been a breath of fresh air becomes recycled and stale. Verber is merely taking an interesting idea and presenting the obvious ""What-ifs"" that immediately pop into one's mind when hearing a synopsis about the film.
The acting was incredibly sub-par as well. Daniel Auteuil, who is on the whole a very good actor gives a performance as monotone and boring as Pignon is (see him in ""The Widow of Saint-Pierre"" if you really want to see what he's made of). Gerard Depardieu is fair, but doesn't show enough desperation that we are told Felix so obviously has. Michele Laroque breathes a little more life into her character Mlle Bertrand, Pignon's secretary; she is the highlight of an ensemble that is relatively uninteresting and never shows enough range.
""The Closet"" is a wasted opportunity. In situational comedy, we need to care about or at least understand the characters to a certain extent or it will be impossible to laugh when they get into trouble. While Verber seemed like he could handle that, in ""The Closet"" it doesn't seem he believes in his characters; as if he believes that the audience need only take them at face value. Unfortunately, ""The Closet"" ranks as one of the most disappointing ventures of the year.",1022889600,2,3053,4.697761194029851
