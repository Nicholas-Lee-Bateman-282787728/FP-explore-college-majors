1650464,4,B00005QW5O,"WOW, Chicks with Guns from MGM, In my dreams, would I wish this to be true. A great concept, Unfortunately it could have been executed a little better. The performances weren't bad but the directing was a little slow. A definite girls movie, my little sister loved it and has watched it over and over. Maybe her friends will pick up some good ideas. For all the guys its worth renting, and for all the girls, you'll end up buying it.",1012867200,2,433,4.3580246913580245
1650465,4,B00005QW5O,"I got to see The Smokers at the New York Independent Film Festival last year and let me tell you, that film kept me thinking for weeks afterwards.  I was finally able to get a copy... since the US version was not out yet.  The first time I saw it was with my boyfriend, and he just could not relate to the film (perhaps the disturbing subject matter was a little too much for him).  It is truly a ""chic flick"".  But I have since passed the film around to all my girlfriends and we all unianimously agree that the filmmakers are definitely making a clear statement.  BOYS BEWARE!!!
Definitely a Cult Classic with a message that must be seen to understand.",1011139200,3,654,4.327868852459017
1650466,1,B00005QW5O,"Easily becoming a candidate for THE cult film of 2001, ""The Smokers"" will shock you; not because it is off-beat, odd, unconventional, or even outlandish, but because it is simply awful.  And fans of Thora Birch, please listen.
The story is about three girls (its leader, Dominique Swain in ""Face Off"" and the newer ""Lolita"") living in a dorm at a school somewhere in country of America, and feeling dissatisfied with their life, they decide to do something radical: so radical that I couldn't believe what I saw.  They are sort of intimidated by boys (so they think), who always get what they want in their love and sex with girls, so, the three start their own revolution.  Of course, things get out of control, and before they knew it, troubles  ensue.
Intersting?  Only on paper.  The result is a mess.  It is shot without wit, humor, or sarcasm to sustain an entire film; all boys are hunks who think about nothing but having sex with girls (except an obligatory geek who wears glasses).  Dialogues are impossible (one character talks about California as a place where they have ""giant mosquitos""... so what?) and irrelevant, but the most depressing thing is its too ridiculous development of story.  For example, see those girls, as a revenge to a boy, try to rape him, sticking a gun to his head (on a heap of corn).  Reasons?  As far as I know, it's because he ditched one of the girls rather unceremonious way.  Or watch another girl shoot a gun in a boy's head because he gets too excited during sex at a prom night.  What happens next?  Nothing.  No police.  As if nothing happened.  Because nobody believed her story!!
I know words such as sub-text or irony, but I don't think I can find them here.  It is because all things are done most bland way, and you just see the girls swear, cry, complain, and even kill (and in one scene, one of them utters a line that is very offensive after her knowing her prospective love turned out to be a gay), but nothing can be accounted for in a reasonable way.  Because of setting of three girls in school, you might be reminded of ""Heathers"" but at least that film had a certain kind of power and wry humor, thanks to Christian Slater and Wynona Rider.  But here ... don't ask me.  And editing is bad so sometimes I had a trouble to follow the story.  (Believe me or not, I watched it twice.)
Finally, about the appearance of my favorite actress Thora Birch.  She appears twice as a sister of one of the girls, but too briefly, so fans don't say I didn't warn you.  And both times she wears a strange paint make-up on the face, so I first could not recognize her.  I like her, I like ""Ghost World"" (great!), but I couldn't find anything good for her career here.  Sorry.",1010620800,25,2720,4.455465587044534

I feel sorry for everyone on this film. Don't watch waiting to see it make sense, or be funny, or be interesting because it never happens. It's really insulting to both sexes. There were SOOOO many bad moments. The Gun was totally stupid & made no sense. They griped about women not having the power in a relationship and then totally gave it away immediately.  The worst was a girl attacked in a limo by a married scumbag she had sex in his limo before who wouldn't give her his number after, asking permission to get out while screaming & trying to get out including stupidly pointing & pulling the trigger on a unloaded gun 6 times, finally she got out and notably stopped next to the limo and waited for her rapist to get out of the limo and catch up to her as she continued to scream no. So insulting, so irresponsible. And the end a girl started on a shower curtain and rather than leaving through the door stayed in the bathroom hysterically screaming and NOT turning on the water or leaving until the raped girl came up to the bathroom and took her place hysterically screaming, as the first girl says I'll come back with help and exits through the door they keep forgetting about, leaving girl #2 to the bathroom inferno.",1479427200,2,1381,4.472222222222222

This is a great coming of age film, and the D, B.P and KLP are awesome actresses.  You gotta have angst and this film is filled with it, to the brim.  Yes the acting is a bit rough, but these girls are all super young and probably their first film so give it up for them.  The plot is good, it's funny, light, dark and touching,  Watch it, it'll be a favorite go to teenage angst film to go back to.",1322870400,,513,3.9901960784313726
1650634,5,B00005QW5O,"I can't believe everyone is so critical against this movie. It could be an age difference. First of all, Dominique Swain is one of the most talented yet unnoticed actress.  Thora Birch had a small part which was cute and funny.
And what high school movie do guys not want to have sex? It would be weird if they didn't. Sure what the girls planned was outrageous and not meant to be literally done but it brings up a very good point of how guys get away with saying and doing anything to girls and we're supposed to sit back and watch it happen. I found this movie to be good, funny and refreshingly different than most high school movies. If someone who hasn't seen the movie is reading this, it's definitely worth it..some of the drama parts will shock you...but the funny shocking parts will make you think and wonder what parts of life you're missing.",1182988800,4,854,4.439490445859873
1650635,1,B00005QW5O,"So these three girls are outcasts, because they smoke but mostly because they are infantile. There's Karen (Freaks & Geek's/Dawson's Creek's Busy Phillips), a scholarship girl who is as irritating but not quite as sexy as Shelley Winters in ""The Poseidon Adventure"", and Lisa (Keri Lynn Pratt who was Miss New Hampshire a couple years earlier), and Jefferson (Ms. Swain-everyone's favorite ""Lolita""). So guess who the writer/director uses for her most erotic shots? That's right Phillips the screaming buffalo. And they wonder why these things lose money.

My guess is a no-talent and soon to be pornmaker woman happened to see a 1968 movie called ""Three In the Attic"" (which has never been released on video) and thought that she could get away with stealing the story. So she began to remake the film without buying the rights or acknowledging that it was a remake. Her boyfriend, who financed it so he could co-star and drool on ""Lolita"", panicked and ordered her to make last minute script changes to avoid a lawsuit. At least this would account for the totally nonsensical storyline.

One easy and generally reliable way to avoid dogmeat stuff like this is to check out the industry experience of whoever is credited with art direction and production design. If it is their first credit you know the picture will be horrible.

Watch this only if you are absolutely determined to see everything Thora Birch has done. She made this between ""American Beauty"" (before its release) and ""Ghost World"". Although I am sure that she would like it off her resume she actually does a good job in a small role. You recognize her voice more than her face and it takes a while because you are struggling internally with disbelief, like if Emma Thompson had made an appearance in ""The New Guy"".

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1126828800,5,1831,4.803174603174603
1650636,1,B00005QW5O,"This is an absolutely terrible film. So bad is this film, that the director herself has never even watched the final cut. So bad in fact, that she packed it in and gave up on Hollywood. Christina Peters is now directing Hustler's ""Young Sluts Inc"" under the name ""Kat Slater"". I just hope for the sake of porn she has learned a thing or two about how to make a good, or at least tolerable ""bad"" movie.",1112745600,5,401,4.220779220779221
1650677,1,B00005QW5O,"There is no true plot to this movie.  It is genuinely meaningless.  The movie centers around four girls who decide to teach men a lesson by assaulting them at gun point and rape them.  Led by the sexual promiscuous member of the group, they set to first get ""revenge"" on one of the girl's boyfriends who just took her virginity.  But here is where the movie comes undone.  The guy did nothing wrong.  He never raped or took advantage of the girl.  She had what effectively amounts to buyer's remorse.  Moreover, the promiscuous girl announces that their criminal actions were going to be done for ""all women.""  With equal nebulous mindless indiscrimination, all men somehow become culpable for some baseless reason.  The girls bumble their attempts, even somewhat humorously trying to arouse a young gay man.  In the interim, the promiscuous leader, while having announced to her friends the worthlessness of the male race, goes out and pursues the worse examples of manhood, getting over her head with one married man, who brutally rapes her in front of his limo driver after throwing her over the hood of the car.  The scenes erratically jumped from one to another with no smooth transitions or logical flow.  Midway through the movie the original premise that the movie was based, namely punishing guys, disintegrates into a completely mindlessly undirected sequence of events.  In one, the shrinking violet who just recently lost her virginity begins to have sex with another guy, but once again she decides she doesn't want sex with him and suddenly pulls out a gun and ends up shooting him to death.  Perhaps this chick is just gay and doesn't know it or really is frightened by sex with men.  But then again, why is she going with men and pursuing sex with them?  The movie ends with the leader of the group burning to death in a comedy of unrealistic errors in trying to set off a fire alarm but inadvertently causes a real fire to rage through a school.  That's it.  That is the whole move.  The whole, worthless, pointless movie.  It makes no sense because there was no point to it.  None of the female characters are coming across sympathetic.  None were victims by anything other than their own stupidities.  The leader of the group calls guys ""mental midgets"" but she ends up proving herself the smallest mental midget of all.  The girls get themselves into their predicaments by mindlessly following an idiot and never once thinking or rationally analyzing the reality and truth of their lives in any honestly introspective way.  Unlike the girls in the movie Foxfire, who are actually victimized and get revenge on their victimizer, you don't feel any sympathy for these mindless, witless wonders.  The movie has no plot, the acting is awful, the editing is even worse, and the dialogue is horrifically unimaginative.  The movie as a whole lacks any substance or purpose and never tells any kind of story.  This therefore is NOT a movie but cinematographic masturbation.",1108252800,19,2985,4.832347140039448
1650678,5,B00005QW5O,"This movie obviously isn't a big-budgeted hollywood production. It's about three girls at an all girls boarding school who are fed up with the way that guys are treating them and taking advantage of them. They decide to fight back by doing things to them to get even and hopefully teach them a lesson. You see how when these girls feel invisible and hurt and repressed, what they do to feel empowered and stand up for themselves, but lose their friendships in the process, which was more important than guys in the first place. I don't know why everyone thinks this movie is so terrible? Not ALL movies are glossy overproduced and manufactured big names with the intention of just making money. Some people think that it's going to be a ""feminist"" movie and are upset when they don't see girls running around and beating guys up. Well as you can see, these girls figure out their own boundaries, and what ""feminism"" means to them.

1650679,1,B00005QW5O,"Bad acting, bad camera work, bad script, bad plot. Bad everything. My sister rented this movie because she wanted to see girls kicking guy's butts. Instead, it was so bad we all had a good laugh over it.
The plot isn't in the least bit inspiring or powerful. Supposedly it's about girls taking back power from guys, when in fact they don't seem to have anything to gripe about. Two of them are virgins with no apparent reason to need to get back at guys. The one who isn't a virgin went out and did some older, rich, married jerk in his limo, then wonders why he wouldn't give her his number? Is this a good reason to feel ""used"" by the male sex? The rest of the movie is supposed to center around this, but this quickly gets pushed aside so that other minor and unimportant underlying plots can be developed. The typical nerd boy=nice boyfriend plot is overplayed. The butt kicking consists of one hilariously unbelievable rape scene before being pushed aside.
Most of this movie was just not believable. From the rape of a guy (did they give him viagra or something?) to the twisted Russian Roulette scene. Like these girls would really do that? Come on.
It gets worse.
Even after feeling ""used"" by the married rich guy, the girl meets with him again. He rushes things and she (finally) decides she wants to get out of the situation. She screams for help, but the limo guy does nothing. She falls out of the limo, only to be raped on the hood of the limo, in front of the driver, in the middle of the street. Despite the fact that a rape scene should be powerful and have some kind of effect on the story, nothing comes of it.
The wussy girl in the group sneaks off to have sex with some guy, then decides she doesn't like it and tells him to stop and hits him with her gun. That only turns him on (because what do you know... these guys like bondage!) and she shoots him in the neck, killing him instantly. She runs and hides the gun in their dorm, only to confess anyway. But no one believes her except one woman, and no one believes this woman either. So instead of the girl being caught, she is put on drugs. What?
Then there is the fire scene. For some reason one of the girls decides to set off the smoke alarm. It's not mentioned why. One minute the girls are being interviewed one by one about the murder, the next they are setting off smoke alarms? But then she magically falls or something, sets a shower curtain on fire, and gets her dress stuck in something you never see. Instead of ripping it or taking the dress off to escape from the unnaturally quickly growing fire, her friend comes and saves her (also not shown how) only to be trapped when a flaming piece of the roof falls on her. She can't get out and burns to death. What? Not only that, but the firemen let the escaped girl's nerd boyfriend come in to the burning building with them? The firemen don't even rush to save this girl. Although honestly, I wouldn't save her either. Now we're supposed to be sad the girl died. Instead, you are left wondering what this has to do with anything. Normally, tragic deaths in movies have something to do with the plot or meaning of the story. Her death was played up as if it put a some kind of closure or moral on the movie. Instead you just wonder where the plot went.
And in the end, the wussy girl marries unhappily and the other marries the nerd right after graduation. Way to be independent, gals.
This movie doesn't even live up to a teen angst story. It completely misses the mark with whatever point it attempted to make. Don't bother.",1089763200,13,3560,4.346846846846847

The other day, when I was at my local video store, I noticed a copy of this wonderous flick in the 99-cent bin. (Actually, several copies.) I looked at the cover. Three girls standing, trying to look threatening! I cried ""MARVELOUS!"" and applauded right then and there. I got funny looks from everyone in the store, but I didn't care. I bought it, took it home, and popped it in my DVD player.
5 minutes later...I had to shut it off, just to regain my senses. The grainy photography...the outlandish makeup...the glorification of weed...the stoned laughter...NO ONE HAS EVER PUT OUT SOMETHING AS BEAUTIFUL AND GENIUS AS THIS!!!
After I got myself back together, I once again hit ""Play"". What a feast for the mind! This is to sight what Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side Of The Moon"" is to sound! And when I heard the brilliant line ""And to all a good high!"", I shut it off once again, ran outside to my porch, and proclaimed, ""I, MR. BUCKLEY, HAVE JUST HEARD THE BEST LINE EVER USED IN A MOVIE!"" and got funny looks from the neighbors. But that was okay. I went back in and hit ""Play"".
Well, it was magnificent. The whole building burning down in the end was a stroke of brilliance. In case you don't understand, this whole movie was to lambaste politics as a whole...biting satire about the state of affairs the economy is in. And for that, it is genius.
If you believed a word of that review, then please do me a favor and jump off of a tall building.

1650682,1,B00005QW5O,"I don't know what we were thinking (my friends and I, that is). We were bored, we were tired and we all had work the next day, so we figured we'd have a quiet night in of beer and videos. So we go down to the shop and one of us (not me, by the way) notices this film. We agreed it looked at least half-decent, so we rented it. What we saw was the most boring, ridiculous excuse for a thriller I'd ever seen in my life.
OK, so the story goes like this: a group of alleged (and not very believable) misfit teenage weed-smoking girls are sick and tired of their unfulfilling sex lives. So rather than just stop going for the biggest bunch of selfish @sshole blokes and look elsewhere for love like any sensible person, they decide to scare the existing men in their lives with guns. Well, a gun that they share between them. The act of these girls pulling down, tieing up and pointing a gun in the face of a bloke twice their size is somehow a 'revolution'.
The film is rediculously amatuerish. Firstly, there are some very unrealistic scenes. A cigarette lighter brushing against a shower curtain for a second (if that) is somehow supposed to start a fire in a bathroom (which like most bathrooms, has tiles on the wall). The rape scene seemed to show little struggling from the girl involved. Surely this part was supposed to be disturbing? If anything, it made me laugh at how atrociously done it was. And how exactly is a woman supposed to rape a bloke? Being hit over the head and then blinded, gagged and tied up would not turn me on in the slightest. Maybe these girls were just too stoned during their sex education lessons.
Secondly, the directing itself is awful. The actors clearly haven't been told exactly what to do in some of the more complex scenes. Without meaning to beat the same old drum, the two rape scenes (one of the girl, one of the guy) showed little co-ordination between the actors. When the guy is being ambushed, he had plenty of chances to fight off or run away. It shouldn't have looked like that.
My biggest gripe was sexist nature of the film. Surely if a film was made enforcing every stereotype of women in existence women would throw their arms in the air in disbelief? Are women in general in a rush to get married and have kids? Good in the kitchen? Care only about money and fast cars? If so, then the idea that men are all chauvinistic, sex-obsessed selfish morons is entirely beleivable. Also notice that the only nice guy in the film was the boring, pseudo-sensitive nerd. I suppose you could say that realism is far from this film's strongest point. Also, this isn't feministic either. Last time I checked, feminism was about equality, not infantile revenge.
This is without doubt one of the dullest most poorly made films I have ever seen. Poorly directed, poorly acted, poor cinematography, poor plot. I can't think of anything about this film that would make me recommend it anyone. If you really want to see a violent, sex-filled story of women killing men, then Baise-Moi is (marginally) better than this.",1070755200,7,3051,4.518987341772152
1650683,5,B00005QW5O,"A movie about 17-year-old girls and sex - without nude scenes? (This is not typical Hollywood.) A portrait of three misguided girls poisoned by the malaise of life at an idyllic, midwest boarding school succumb to the polictically correct ideals of contemporary US culture, and declare themselves to be no longer victims of men. They make a pact and begin a revolution to avenge all women, and regain the personal power robbed from them.  So starts their campaign of rape against the male student body. However, this is no feminist film. Even armed with a handgun, the girls find themselves unable to take the power they crave away from the boys.

This is a powerful and introspective film about what it means to declare oneself a victim, or even to declare oneself a victim no more.  The Smokers raises serious questions about our actions and responsibilities, and leaves the viewer struggling to find the answers.

However, be forewarned!  While this film is novel and the ideas it explores are worthwhile, the execution is crass and lacks good acting, or perhaps good direction.  I can't say which for sure! Perhaps universally poor acting is a sign of poor direction, or poor script writing?  But since the writer and director are the same person, Kat Slater, let's just agree to blame her for all that is lacking in this film!  If you can do that, and get past its crass and campy nature, then this film will give you something *real* to think about.",1068336000,8,1455,4.746031746031746

As the other reviews stated, this seemed to be some sort of attempt at misguided feminism, but there's no real direction.  The whole idea of the gun and what it symbolizes gets pushed into the shadows only to re-emerge briefly to invoke a response of ""Oh yeah, they have a gun.""  The package cover merely hints at the mood/flavor that the movie should have had.

This is another movie that had some powerful elements, but didn't know what to do with them.  The gun's potential as a phalic symbol is wasted.  The best lines aren't built upon.  Example: The leader of the Smokers yells to a boy, ""You have no idea how frustrating it is having to rely on someone else to fill your hole!""  To which he replies, ""We all have a hole to fill.""  That is the very essence of this script!  That moment should have been what this film was built around.

I have heard many opinions about The Smokers. Some were positive many were negative. Somehow I think the point of this movie and it's plot have been missed. Number these girls are supposed to be teenagers (young and inexperienced) how could anyone take offense to they're standing as feminists. They were desperate girls not female freedom fighters.
Then the misinterpretation that these girls were just wanting sex from the guys is very very wrong. Number one rapes (committed by anyone) are not just about sex. They are need for control over another person. All these girls were trying to do was let the male sex know how they felt being used and thrown away.

I find it pretty stupid, though, for people to say they don't like it because of the quality of the filming. It's SUPPOSED to be filmed like that, and I think it enhances the movie. Overall, it's a pretty cool movie...I mean, it's not the same kind of mindless teenager movie we always see. At least it isn't just another teen movie.

1650739,1,B00005QW5O,"This movie possibly contains the worst messages about women that I have ever had the misfortune to see.  Anyone who watches this movie thinking that the themes it portrays is feminism is sorely deluded on the meaning of the word and has misconstrued the actions of these poorly developed characters.
For starters, feminism, by definition, connotes equality between the sexes.  Not raping men.  Calm down boys.  You'll be okay.
That said, I thought the initial idea was promising, but simultaneously amused and horrified at what happened when they acted out this scene.  As part of a film, the idea that women can force men into having sex (which, personally, I would find difficult unless he found a chick threatening to kill him arousing) is very powerful.  Not suggesting that we should try it, but the inversion of social practices in a movie or book reinforces that the original idea is wrong.  Showing women raping men, and how horrible that would be, would show how wrong it is that men force women to have sex, and suggest equality rather than actually inversion of the practice.  It isn't any better for one sex to dominate the other.  That would have been a good message for a movie.
However, this whole idea falls flat, as the characters pretend to relate to the struggles of teenager girls and then proceed to reinforce the Christian idea that women need to be pure and virginal.  I don't think anyone could fail to notice how the virgin is the only one in the movie who manages to come out of this situation intact.  Karen and Lisa are both violated; Karen is outright raped and expelled.  Lisa loses her boyfriend through their dysfunctional relationship and ends up in a loveless marriage.  The pure innocent virgin gets married happily ever after to the only decent man in the film.  She also quits smoking pot.  Clean up the language and you can show it at Sunday school.
The movie begins well.  The characters are interesting and rebellious.  But it simply denies the girls the right to choose what they want.  They are reduced to the image of what they should be, and are harshly punished if they cannot fit into that mold.  A girl can't want sex and still be the ""good""?  Why does the film leave out the reasons Karen is so angry and distrustful of men to begin with?  This girl acts like she's already been psychologically damaged by a man prior to the film, thus her incredible anger.  The insensitivity given to these girls is disgusting.  The conclusion is forced.  The cinematography is appalling.
I am a watcher of independent films, and I say to any film fans out there, do not expect them to be this badly done.  On occasion, people think about what they are writing before attempting to sell it to an audience under an assumed name.  As a feminist, I wouldn't touch this movie ...",1048636800,5,2808,4.65650406504065

I started watching it and, despite being turned off by the amount of pot-smoking involved, was still sucked in.  Every girl feels like these three did- maybe not to their extent- but definitely small glimpses of the idea of being in control; the idea of having a second where she wishes to not feel the stigma of society's role for women as the weaker sex should hit home. (Wow, sounds like some drunk psychology major.)  All in all, the solemn feeling sprinkled with sexual tension, tender moments, small chuckles, and glimpses of the other end of the rainbow (in Loeb's character) truly left its mark and hit the nail home that hope and patience should always be maintained when dealing with the one we wish for.

I can say this: this film brings us many great young stars and each do their best to bring this story to life.

So, the box describes girls wanting to get revenge on the guys who wronged them. And yes, i agree that, although that is what the box says, that is not really what the movie is about.

Dominique Swain and an unrecognizable since ""American Beauty"" Thora Birch play 2 out of a unmemorable group of schoolgirls who smoke too much and try to be ""cool"".  They take it a step further by raping male student/aquaintances at gunpoint to prove they are powerful.  Every scene is filled with people smoking something, and not always tobacco.  That pretty much sums it up as far as plot goes, but then again, the title sums up the plot just as well.

This film comes off as an independent cheapie production.  Bad direction, cinematography ect. It isn't innovative, artsy, or interesting in the least.  I even gave it nearly an hour before ejection time.  Most of the time if the film hasn't grabbed me by 30 minutes, that's it.

A film  glamorizing SMOKING?  What year is it?  Didn't smoking go out of style decades ago?  With the exception of bars and clubs, aren't people  excluded in public places where this habit has been shunned and restricted for quite awhile?  I just DON'T see any point in producing a pretentious and vapid movie basing it's non-plot on supposedly cool girls smoking heavily, being used for casual sex, and then raping guys for revenge and control.
