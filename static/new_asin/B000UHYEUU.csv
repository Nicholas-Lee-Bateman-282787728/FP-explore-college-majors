2921813,1,B000UHYEUU,Season 6? I thought we were up to season 4. I love this show but my god what a mess the DVD releases are.,1191456000,3,105,3.4166666666666665
2921814,5,B000UHYEUU,"Same show as was on tv. If you liked it then, you'll like it now. BTW, yes, the episode where sr fires jr is on here.",1386288000,,117,3.5384615384615383
2921815,3,B000UHYEUU,if they would show the bikes up close.and give out more stats on the bikes.and less bickering this show would be great. but i want to see more of the bikes,1382745600,,155,4.032258064516129
2921816,3,B000UHYEUU,"I like when the focus wis on the craftsmanship and the build
with a little mikey humor mixed in
too much family drama
good luck",1381795200,,127,4.12
2921817,3,B000UHYEUU,The shop produces some excellent bikes. The designs are always all original. I love the creativity and the fabrication process. I can't stand the level of drama!,1374364800,,161,5.0
2921818,4,B000UHYEUU,"I've watched the guys on and off for years. This is the final chapter. It's still sad but humorous to see Sr. actually think that HE did everything on his own...and he 'writes' a book about it (for ha ha's read the reviews on amazon about that book...LOL!!!)

With the fact that last week, they filed for partial bankruptcy you can see how the bikes have gone down as well as the clients that want to work with Sr.

What goes around comes around, and it's funny to see who ends up getting the old 'size 12's' in the end...",1361145600,,522,4.21
2921819,4,B000UHYEUU,1st of all i watched season 6 on Amazon Prime instant videos for free. I'm glad I did not purchase the dvd's after reading the other reviews. So for me I had a more positive experience and this is one of the best seasons yet! I love the drama between Sr & his sons. Interesting to watch Jr & Mikey try to figure things out post OCC. Can't wait for the next season to come to Prime!,1360800000,,381,3.961038961038961
2921820,1,B000UHYEUU,"Season 6, Ep 19... Paul adds custom graphics to his new pickup for his business and puts a BIG misspelled "" original"" on it. He does ""orginal"" work... LOL",1351555200,2,154,4.344827586206897
2921821,3,B000UHYEUU,"This set includes 3 disks with 2 shows per disk, total of 6 episodes. The episodes are:

77 Wendy's Bike 1  Originally Aired: 6/5/2006
78 Wendy's Bike 2  Originally Aired: 6/12/2006
79 Sunoco Bike 1  Originally Aired: 6/19/2006
80 Sunoco Bike 2  Originally Aired: 6/19/2006
81 Bill Murray Bike 1  Originally Aired: 8/7/2006
82 Bill Murray Bike 2  Originally Aired: 8/14/2006

I believe these sets are privately produced by Amazon, definitely not by the Learning Channel's production company. This is a bare bones set. NO special features, not even a disk menu to choose episodes on each disk. Discovery did much better with seasons 1-3, these new sets leave much to be desired, and at around $5 per episode, the price is steep. Still fun if you want to have these episodes. Come on Learning/Discovery- you can do better than this!!!!!",1211932800,,834,4.865248226950355
2921822,3,B000UHYEUU,"The dvds are definitely manufactured by someone different than the first 3 seasons.  The dvds are really bad in the fact that they are out of order on the disc (episode wise).  I also had a disc arrive that did not even work.  The best part is that the cheap producers did not use any anti-burning techniques, so you can burn / copy them all you want.  Might save you some money if you don't want to pay the 30 bucks per set.  I would ask around if I were you before buying.

On a good note, the show is still excellent and provides lots of entertainment.  I love American Choppers.  I just hope they choose a better company next time to release the dvds, just for their sake, because pirating is going to be an issue with seasons 4-5-6 (which I bought).",1202860800,,754,4.223776223776224
2921823,2,B000UHYEUU,"If you are a die-hard fan of American Chopper, you will like this.  However, the dvd production values are horrible!!!!  There are no menus. There are no extras!  You have to speed through the first episode to get to the second episode because there are no menus.  ALSO, Bill Murray is NOT featured on these dvds as it says in the description.  I don't know who produced these dvds, but they are horrible!  You'd be better off taking the money you would spend on these dvds and subscribing to cable television where you're guaranteed to see all the American Chopper episodes!  Very disappointing!",1201132800,3,596,4.728155339805825
8213318,5,B000UHYEUU,The only reason this episode garners 5 stars is because I work at Colmet and see that motorcycle everyday.,1526688000,,106,4.631578947368421
8213319,5,B000UHYEUU,Still one of my favorite shows.  Glad I can stream these now.  Looking forward to the shows return in May 2018.,1516492800,,111,4.238095238095238
8213320,2,B000UHYEUU,"Loved the show when it first came on. It's sad that the blow-up eventually became the focal point of the show. It makes the seasons harder to watch. Just, meh!",1515715200,,159,4.333333333333333
8213321,5,B000UHYEUU,"Love the drama that surrounds the Teutels, and really enjoy watching the bikes come together.",1480550400,,93,5.266666666666667
8213322,5,B000UHYEUU,"overpriced, great show",1437523200,,22,6.666666666666667
8213323,5,B000UHYEUU,"I bought the standard edition of this, but didn't like it. HD is a Much better copy of Jon & Kate Bike. I like American Chopper and Jon & Kate + 8 so this was a great show.",1415836800,,172,3.5526315789473686
8213324,3,B000UHYEUU,Works for me only without all the fighting.  I wouldn't want to ride any of those bikes but enjoy the construction process,1392249600,,122,4.545454545454546
8213325,5,B000UHYEUU,But really enjoy watching the coming together of the bikes they build. Always enjoyable to see the outcome of these sweet machines!,1390867200,,131,5.0
8213326,2,B000UHYEUU,Same old stuff. Grown men throwing things . The only reason I watch is Mikey!! And the other guys in the shop. Jr. and Sr.  Need to go to anger management classes!!!,1389657600,,165,4.15625
8213327,1,B000UHYEUU,"Finally these posers got dropped by discovery!  in my opinion, (and other REAL bike builders that i know) this was way overdue",1388793600,,126,4.7272727272727275
