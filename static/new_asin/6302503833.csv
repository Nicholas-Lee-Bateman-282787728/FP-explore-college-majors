474017,5,6302503833,"I am probably the biggest Scared Stupid fan that there is.  This movie is just absolutly brilliant!  It's funny and scary all at the same time.  Even though small kids might find Trantor (the troll) frightening (as I once did when it first came out)!  I own this movie and definatly recommend it to anyone who even remotly likes Ernest or Jim Varney.  If you like Ernest but have never seen this, watch it as a tribute to him, not only is it his best movie, but his acting and comedy is at its best!*****",1009843200,,504,4.2631578947368425
474018,1,6302503833,"I have seen pretty much all of the Earnest movies and I think that they are great for kids. It is about a monster that eats kids to gain more power.  It sneaks up on kids wail they are outside, inside anywhere. It terrified the kids that watched it they couldn't sleep with out having nightmares for a month! it is not good for kids!",990403200,2,333,4.123076923076923

It's a part of my Halloween movie tradition. Ernest is his usual hilarious self. Sure, there was a small level of cheeziness but hey, it's a family movie. Something kids would enjoy. I love this movie and look forward to watching it every Halloween time. I rent this every year from Movie Gallery but incase it's gone someday, like the way they got rid of their copy of The Monster Squad, I hope ... will get this movie soon so I can have a chance at owning my own copy.",979948800,,635,4.213114754098361

474266,5,6302503833,"In cinema there are the greats and then the imitators. Jim varney was not great and not a imitator. He was simply jim varney and this shines straight threw when he played this iconic idiot. Who would think that ernest would start on vhs, fill his destiny on dvd and then migrate onto blu-ray all because of the loyal fans that simply could not get enough.

This blu-ray is possibly the crowning jewel in my collection based on my obsession with horror movies, family halloween flicks & the bizarre. The
blu-ray is the best there is at the moment of jim varneys iconic idiot turned troll hunter. The packageing contains one blu-ray amaray with case art, the movie itself is on one 50GB blu-ray disc that oddly enough has disc art when most releases now have no disc art in a attempt of saving money. The film is presented in widescreen and restored in the clearest quality since it's theatric debute.

Beside these facts, eaither you love his portrail of the moron named ernest or you simple enough dispise him. Eaither way this blu-ray shows that this character will long be forgotten. If your a fan, or viewing this fantastic film for the first time this blu-ray is the best way to go. Now how about putting ernest saves christmas on blu-ray and completing the 4 iconic films that made jim varney the household star.",1455840000,,1317,4.6

I can remember being a kid watching this movie and being scared of the trolls but Ernest has a way of making it more funny than anything.,1438128000,,368,4.054794520547945

474443,1,6302503833,"First off I like Jim Varney's films.  He was a very talented actor and many of his films were good and entertaining.  Ernest  goes to Jail,Saves Christmas and Camp were all wonderful family films, that I would recommend to anyone ""You know what I mean Vern"".  But this film is an out and out dud easily the worst of his work.  I think people are giving this movie ratings that the film does not deserve, just because of his passing away so young.  You would be doing a disservice to the buying public rating this film above 2 stars.  You can't rate a film really high from past accomplishments by the actor and that's what I am seeing over and over with reviews for this film.  I would rate the other Ernest films 3 to 4 stars because they are all decent just not this film.

I saw this in the theater when it was released and it was easily the worst film of that year in my opinion.  Young children will probably be scared of the troll turning kids into what looked like tree stumps.  Ernest plays a doofus with a heart of gold like normal, but in this film the plot just does not seem to work very well.  Now I get that this is a Halloween film meant to be mildly scary, with a Halloween vibe. I just thought it came off as stupid and not scary. The acting is not very good by any of the other cast members and after awhile you will get bored with the troll constantly beating up Ernest and can't wait for the movie to end.

I really enjoyed Ernest goes to Jail which came out the previous year and had high hopes that this film would be just as good.  I should have waited for it to come out on video because this movie was awful.  I would definitely skip this movie and watch Beverly Hillbillies or any of the other Ernest films except this one.  Most big movie stars eventually make a bad movie and for Jim Varney this is it.  This film does not get any better with age it is just as bad as it was when it first came out. I felt this was a big step back for the Ernest franchise and would not recommend the movie to anyone.",1437004800,,2028,4.106598984771574

474485,5,6302503833,"I'll admit that I'm coming at this movie through nostalgia-tinted glasses. I saw it in the theater and discovering that my wife referred to milk as ""miak"" is one of the many things that cemented her status as wife material.

Is this a great movie? Maybe not. Is it silly nonthreatening Halloween fun with an infectiously over the top performance from Jim Varney? Definitely. The movie strikes a nice balance between humor and horror with enough jokes to keep the adults entertained while not being so scary that it's going to terrify the children. Plus it's filled with hilarious one-liners from Varney who was always criminally underrated in his Ernest persona.

Note that the troll outfit is very detailed. Surprisingly so for a low budget flick like this. It might not be suitable for the younger crowd, but otherwise this is a timeless movie that's good for the kids and so-bad-it's-good for the adults in the room.",1432598400,,919,4.8471337579617835

It's up to Ernest and his only real friends (children and his faithful lovable dog) to stop this evil horrible troll before he takes all the children away.  The parents think he's just a stupid kid...... when in reality he's the only true good to honest person left (besides the children).

474803,5,6302503833,"Growing up, I loved the first four Ernest movies. Of the four, Ernest Scared Stupid just happens to be my favorite Ernest movie of the whole franchise. So I was glad to finally get around to getting the blu-ray version of the movie.

The movie itself is just as entertaining for me as it was when I was a a kid. Here we have Ernest currently working as a town's apparent sole garbage man who has befriended several middle-school aged kids. Long before, Ernest's ancestor, a local reverend, helped imprison an evil troll under an oak tree who had been kidnapping local children to increase his power. The troll, before being officially imprisoned, placed a curse on Ernest's ancestor holding that one day  he would escape through one of his descendants, as well each of his descendants would become dumber and dumber.

In the present, one night before Halloween, Ernest and his young friends find the perfect spot for a treehouse...that happens to be the same tree planted on top of the troll. Ernest inadvertently releases the troll who immediately returns to his mission. So it's up to Ernest and the kids to find a way to stop the troll.

ESS is probably the most ""fantastical"" of the Ernest movies, involving trolls and magic (unless you count Saves Christmas with included the real life Santa).  As an Ernest movie, there's only so much one can expect. In some sense, if you've seen one Ernest movie you pretty much have a good idea what they're all like. Ernest is still up to his lighthearted, accident-prone, goofy self.

At 26, I still found the movie as entertaining as when I did in the early 90s.

As for the blu-ray itself, unfortunately it's pretty bare. It's one of those movies that jumps right into the movie. There's no special features, which at this point in the DVD and blu-ray lifespan, is pretty sad if you ask me.

The movie's special effects were pretty well done. Certain aspects might very well remind you of another classic 80s movie, Killer Klowns From Outer Space, such as designs for a few of the trolls and manner of deaths. That's because the Chiodo Brothers, who did the effects, also were masterminds behind the previous mentioned horror movie.

All in all, Ernest Scared Stupid is a very enjoyable movie and a must see for all long-time Ernest fans.",1352332800,2,2284,4.69
474834,3,6302503833,"This umpteenth screen appearance for Ernest P. Worrell has the bumbling handyman accidentally awaken an imprisoned troll a day before Halloween, leading to the creature going on a rampage through a small town. It's probably the most imaginative Ernest adventure and features appropriately gruesome creature effects by the Chiodo Brothers (who also created the Critters and the Killer Klowns from Outer Space). The production values are also quite good, but the kids are a little grating.

My only real complaint is the same thing that bugged with previous Ernest movies. Director John Cherry is so used to directing television and commercials that you can tell he's given every shot in the movie a maximum of two takes, giving everything a badly-rehearsed feel. Sounds like a petty grievance, but it would have made a difference to hone the acting a little more and tighten things up.

Probably not a Halloween classic, but it's hardly a time of year for family movies.

The Blu-ray looks great in 1.78:1 1080p but features plain-old Dolby 2.0 sound. There are no extras, not even a menu. But for a bargain bin Mill Creek release, it's still worth the money.",1351641600,6,1158,4.958762886597938

Worrell (Ernest Goes to Jail, Saves Christmas, Rides Again, etc.), then you'll automatically know that Ernest Scared Stupid is going to be silly, yet funny. I was a fan of Ernest (played by the late Jim Varney) when I was a little kid, so I watched a majority of the movies that he starred in. These movies may be look dated now, but they're still fairly entertaining. The plot in Scared Stupid is pretty simple: Ernest has to stop a legendary troll from dominating the children of the world. Story may lack imagination, but it's the over-the-top humor that counts. There are some unbelievably silly (not to mention annoying) moments here and there, but it is really just harmless fun. The kid characters are dull, and aren't really the ones who would usually care about (but at least Ernest and Old Lady Hackmore have some interesting chemistry together). Even if it isn't top-notch humor, it's still fairly entertaining to watch, especially during Halloween.

That's what Jim Varney did.  His Earnest P. Worrell was to the 80's and 90's what the likes of Abbott and Costello, the Three Stooges and the Bowery Boys were to the 40's and 50's: silly, juvenile slapstick brought to you by kooky but lovable characters.  Sure they were low budget, flawed and, some might say, just plain stupid, but, why did they have to be anything more?  Knowwhutimean?",1155081600,4,558,4.55
474931,4,6302503833,"In the sleepy little town of Briarville, an ancient curse is about to be unleashed on the unsuspecting inhabitants. Ernest P., the last surviving Worrell, will unintentionally, and quite stupidly, set loose the evil troll known as Trantor from his sacred prison to visit horror and tragedy on the innocent townsfolk once again. It will then be solely up to Ernest, the lovable and brainless redneck garbage man, to destroy the evil creature once and for all before he transforms all the children of Briarville into wooden dolls on Halloween night!

The late, great Jim Varney shined whenever he played the role of loving and childlike Ernest P. Worrell, and ""Ernest, Scared Stupid"" is one of his finest moments! In no danger of being declared one of the greatest films ever made, it is nonetheless highly enjoyable, as any Ernest film should be. Perfect for the annual Halloween viewing at the very least! Together with his dog, Rimshot, some high-spirited neighborhood kids, and the advice of the mysterious ""Old Lady"" Hackmore, Ernest takes on his deadly foe headfirst, with all the careless and steadfast determination the character is known for, and with all the humor too! Easily among the best of the Ernest films, ""Ernest, Scared Stupid"" mixes familiar Varney characters with fantastic Halloween fun! Gailard Sartain is missed as Bobby's big-mouthed brother Chuck, but John Cadenhead does a fair job, and the cast is sufficient since Ernest is the real focus. Eartha Kitt adds some extra luster to the line-up as Old Lady Hackmore. Excellent, slightly scary entertainment for the whole family! The DVD is disappointingly bare bones, without so much as a trailer or bio, and it's not even widescreen, but at such an affordable price as this film can be found, one shouldn't hesitate to add ""Ernest, Scared Stupid"" to their DVD collection!
