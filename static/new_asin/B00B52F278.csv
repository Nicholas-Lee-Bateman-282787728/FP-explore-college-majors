The Spartacus saga on Starz has given us some of the most powerful and dramatic television of the past decade, and this final season may just be the best of the lot. Spartacus: War of the Damned picks up maybe a year after the stunning finale of Spartacus: Vengeance. Having taken his revenge against the Roman patricians that enslaved him and killed his wife and friends, Spartacus leads what is now an army of liberated slaves in all-out war against the Republic.  He struggles with both the cunning Imperator leading the Romans against him and the growing tensions within his own army, mowing down legions and cities while gathering strength for what may become an epic battle for Rome itself.

With this conclusion of the Spartacus series, Stephen DeKnight and company have achieved something quite rare in television, or anywhere else for that matter: an epic story simultaneously offering compelling plot, characters, action and drama, while staying remarkably close to (what we know of) the story of the real-life Spartacus.  It's a brutal story, and the show pulls absolutely no punches in the telling, but despite that - or perhaps because of it - this is some of the finest television I've seen since M*A*S*H.  Here's why:

- With each season the scope of the story has grown, and the story line has become more suble and complex.  War of the Damned is no exception.  Spartacus and his army have Rome in a near-panic. The Senate enlists ultra-wealthy consul Marcus Crassus to hire an army and put down the rebellion.  From the first episode we see that Spartacus is facing an equally intelligent, deadly and determined opponent in Crassus; this is as much a war of wills and cunning as it is of swords.  Both commanders also have to deal with dissent and intrigue within their own ranks: Spartacus with Crixus's ongoing lust for strategy-free head-to-head combat, and Crassus with the struggle of wills between himself, his coming-of-age son Tiberius, and a young, mad-genius praetor named Gaius Julius Caesar. (Yeah - THAT Julius Caesar.)

- Once again the cast has outdone themselves.  In reviews of the previous three seasons I've noted one or two exceptional performances, a task which has grown steadily more difficult as the overall quality of the acting has continued to improve.  This time around it's *really* hard to pick a standout; everyone involved with this show clearly gave their all and then some to wrap things up in style.  I'll name two, but bear in mind that there are about a dozen ties for a very close third place:

---- Liam McIntyre.  It took him a few episodes in S:V to get comfortable with the daunting job of filling Andy Whitfield's sandals but fill them he did, and in WotD he has the role of the ruthless, idealistic warrior-king solidly nailed.

---- Dustin Clare.  This season he backed off on the gonzo just a notch and it *works*, making Gannicus the perfect rogue super-warrior with just a hint of weariness showing through.  If he survives the series finale (airing in about 15 minutes as I write this) this is the guy I'd want to see in his own spinoff series.

- Once again they've raised the bar with some of the best FX and cinematography on television.  The directors had a little fun with their state-of-the-art camera platforms this time, giving us some slick POV and following shots as the actors whirl and tumble in battle, and even more ambitious and exciting movie-quality CGI.  I'm looking forward to seeing the behind-the-scenes specials when the DVDs come out.  And, once again, they've used all these nifty tools to give us some jaw-droppingly powerful and beautiful moments; see below for one of the better examples.

- In my review of Spartacus: Vengeance, I made a few critical points in that the two post-Blood and Sand series tended to start slowly and, more importantly, that the story was in danger of becoming lost in the increasingly gratuitous and over-the-top sex and gore. I'm not so conceited as to think DeKnight and Co. read that review and instantly saw the error of their ways, but they've certainly listened to someone of like sentiment. This time around the story went into high gear literally from the first minute of the first episode and rarely let up afterward. The sex is still as explicit and the swordplay still as gory as ever, but they aren't shoving our faces in the latter as was becoming endemic in S:V; indeed, as in Blood and Sand, they're once again using it at times to genuine artistic effect.

Best example: In episode eight, ""Separate Paths,"" a major character is captured and beheaded by the Romans (not exactly a spoiler in *this* series) as his lover is forced to watch.  A split-second before his end, the scene cuts to an extreme close-up of the woman, and we see the coup de grace reflected in her teared-up eye.  Beautiful (as far as that word can apply to a beheading,) and ten times the impact of just letting us watch the victim spew a gallon of blood and collapse.

The end of the series is about 45 minutes away as I write this, and what I said in my review of S:B&S stands now more than ever: If you have any interest at all in historical fiction and you can handle the TV-MA material, this series is an unqualified must-see.  Five stars with blood-spattered laurel wreaths.

(9/4)  Discs in hand at last!  So far I've watched episode 1 and the special features.  As with S:V, the quality in 1080p, even for the featurettes, is amazing; razor-sharp video that shows off the attention to detail that was put into the sets, costumes and such - it's more like a ten-hour movie than a TV series.  (As with the other season sets, that sharp detail also shows off some added, and at times quite gory, footage cut from the broadcast version.)  The special features were imho a bit heavy on training (the ""Spartacus Workout"" - oy) and a bit light on production stuff, but you still get a lot of good supplemental material: interviews with past and present cast members including a too-brief chat with Andy Whitfield, some good candid behind-the-scenes material both on- and off-set, and a very good, extended interview with Stephen DeKnight on how the series came to be, and the challenges they faced when moving beyond the fixed sets of the first two seasons to the slopes of Vesuvius and the hills of Rome.  You get a really good feel of the close camaraderie of the cast and crew both on- and off-camera, imho one of the major factors in making this show a success.  All in all, well worth watching.",1361491200,154,6536,4.716798592788039

This is an entertaining movie, but it is chock full of sexual and violent situations.  It is not made for young eyes.  The story leaves you wanting more.  The costumes and scenery seem as though they are directly from the period of time in which the show is based.  I would recommend to others.

Very titillating and entertaining as well. If you are in to sword and sandals (and sex), then you won't see better than the Spartacus Series.

I have no idea why very graphic soft porn is necessary to advance what is a good story. Be aware of full frontal nudity, even the men and constant reference to ""c#cks"". In War of the Damned is a completely raw homosexual scene, and sorry, no homophobe, but the sight of two men locked in tongue in mouth nude embrace (and the other very graphic heterosexual scenes) just made me pull the plug. Made it thru the 3rd episode, but will file this away (probably in the trash barrel). It's too bad as the rest of it is well done.

5556184,5,B00B52F278,"The Starz TV series version of the life of Spartacus, Roman gladiator turned rebel leader, always had a lot more in common with 300 than the Kirk Douglas/Stanley Kubrick classic movie.  The TV series was anything but subtle, with enough excess blood, gore and explicit sex to have earned it an NC-17 rating if it had been a feature film.  Many considered it a guilty pleasure during its original run, but now, more than two years after it concluded, it is obvious that SPARTACUS allowed viewers to enter a world every bit as complex and vivid as the one portrayed on GAME OF THRONES, but unlike Westeros, ancient Rome actually existed, and the gladiator schools, the arena, the opulent villas and estates ruled by patrician masters who made themselves virtual gods over their human slaves, were quite real.  Spartacus, Crixus, Caesar, Batiatus, Crassus and many more really did live and breathe on this earth at one time.  All of which makes SPARTACUS such a thrilling story.

After the end of season 2, and the dispatching of such great antagonists as Glaber, Lucretia, and Ashur, I didn't know where the final season of SPARTACUS would go; being familiar with the historical facts, I knew it wouldn't end well for our heroes and wondered how producer Steven DeKnight would handle it.  I can say with certainty that SPARTACUS: WAR OF THE DAMNED ended things on just the right note in letting our heroes go down swinging against the hated Romans.  They may have lost, but they most definitely were not defeated.  For us loyal fans, this final trip to the arena with these vibrant characters we have come to care about with such passion is emotionally satisfying and a fine payoff after everything that has come before.

We know from the beginning that Spartacus, Crixus, Gannicus and the rest will not emerge victorious in the their war against Rome, even if they've done a very good job of coming out on top so far.  The compelling storyline in WAR OF THE DAMNED is how they manage to continue to dodge their fate, and when it becomes inevitable, how well they meet it head on with courage in the face of all the fury Rome could throw at them.

A couple of things stayed true to the end, the foremost being the pacing of the show, by which I mean never going more than two commercial breaks (10 minutes give or take) without the viewer being treated to a scene of hardcore gore and violence and/or explicit sex.  Did this show set a record for having characters copulate?  Same for having bodies impaled, hacked and dismembered.  And all of it in vivid color.

Another was the stark contrast it drew between the haughty Romans and the salt of the earth slaves-something the Kubrick movie did as well by casting British actors as the Romans and Americans as the rebelling slaves.  In WAR OF THE DAMNED, the Roman commanders are still just as cruel, conniving and treacherous as their predecessors in previous seasons, staring with Simon Merrells as Marcus Crassus and Tod Lasance as Julius Caesar.  The only difference this time around is that Crassus and Caesar do not make the mistake of underestimating Spartacus in the same way as Glaber.  Christian Antidormi stands out as Tiberius, Crassus's son, an even more monstrous version of his father.

Liam McIntyre had the unenviable task of stepping into Andy Whitfield's shoes when the latter was stricken with cancer after season one; he truly makes the role of Spartacus his own in this final season-a great tactical commander and a true leader of men, traits that McIntyre embodies perfectly.  He stands in good contrast with Manu Bennett's Crixus and Dustin Clare's Gannicus, his lusty and hot-tempered lieutenants-men who started out as rivals and opponents and became true brothers in making common cause against their oppressors. Cynthia Addai-Robinson as Naeiva, Crixus's soul mate, proves herself every bit a ferocious as the men.  It is truly hard to watch them meet their ends in the finale.

One of the pleasures of SPARTACUS was the fascinating look it gave us at a pre Christian civilization-one where our notion of the dignity of all men and women and inherent rights of all people were very alien concepts.  It also gives us a world virtually without any sexual hang ups whatsoever; where same sex relationships were common and no big deal, as witness the gladiator Agron, played by Daniel Feuerriegal and the former house slave, Nasir (Pana Hema Taylor).  Agron being the only member of the House of Batiatus who does manage to survive and escape to freedom in the finale.

In the time since SPARTACUS: WAR OF THE DAMNED concluded, fans have been able to catch Nick Taraday (Ashur) and Liam McIntrye as villains on THE FLASH series on the CW, while Manu Bennett (who's good in anything) was an awesome Deathstroke on the same channel's ARROW.  However, there will never be another SPARTACUS, it was so much more than a guilty pleasure, and it looks spectacular on Blu Ray.",1441324800,,4940,4.789163722025913

I'm one who thinks that if he had been killed, there is no way that his head/body would not have made it to Rome.

5556214,5,B00B52F278,"Spartacus: War of the Damn, Season 3 culminates in the horde of former slaves against the might of the Roman Empire.  But to get to that point, much happens.  Spartacus ""The Bringer of Rain"" (Liam McIntyre) with loyal friends Crixus ""The Undefeated Gaul"" (Manu Bennett), Agron (Daniel Feuerriegel) and his ""special friend"" Nasir (Pana Hema Taylor) and Gannacus (Dustin Clare), Doctore/Oenamaeus (Peter Mensah) and others and the replacement for the original Naevia (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) start early in the season attempting to take over a town which could eventually house and potential feed the army of former slaves.

A long and involved story is wonderfully created weaving in and out of the Spartacus camp to that of monied Roman Marcus Crassus (Simon Merrells), a self imposed Imperator (leader) of an army he has raised to stamp out Spartacus.  Aided by his only son Tiberius (Christian Antidormi) and Gaeis Julius Caesar (Todd Lasance [a dead ringer for Brad Pitt]), the legion follows Spartacus from town to mountain to town again.

The attempt to give a synopsis to this season would be akin to trying to sum up a World War.  Yes, you could say ""People fought and people died"" but that doesn't bring justice to anybody or anything.  The acting in this short series was very, very good.  It appeared the Spartacus camp fellows/former gladiators of the House of Battiatus had truly become friends along the way.  Given that there was enough time with the many season, this could have easily been done.",1434153600,,1511,4.98804780876494

I watched all 4 seasons in about a week and I have watched a few of the epsiodes multiple times....That being said, this show is not for everyone. A lot of people will find it extremely offensive. There is a lot of full frontal male and female nudity in every episode, fairly graphic sex scenes, it is extremely violent there is a scene where this guy gets stabbed in the leg with a little knife and then about 3 minutes later he gets the front of his head sliced off by a sword and his brain falls out. Plenty of profanities as well. Not offensive to me, but if that kind of thing does offend you I can only say that if you can look past that and pay attention to the parts of the show that actually matter you will not be disappointed. I would recommend watching the show chronologically. The 2nds Season takes place a few years before the first one does...regardless, watch it and you will like it",1425168000,,1032,4.212121212121212

5556258,1,B00B52F278,"In the movie Spartacus starring Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas, you, as the viewer, rooted for the former gladiator and his band of rebels. You watched with baited breath as Spartacus and his fellow warriors fought their way to the promise of freedom, and watched with teary eyes as Spartacus and his fellow warriors fell to the Romans. Such sympathy and suspension of disbelief are sorely lacking in this childish retelling of the rebel slave, as offered by that factory of sex, gore, fierce hunks and vicious Maybelline model vixens--Starz!  With special effects ripped off from the movie 300, poor writing and sneering one-dimensional characters, this Spartacus proves to be one big headache, and the worst part of it is that by the second episode of this final season, you're actually rooting for the Romans to cut down these smug, self-righteous, tiresome, merry band of multicultural men.  Here I will try to break down, to the best of my ability, the reasons why I detested this chucklefest.
  The violence is cartoonish to the point of being laughable.  These fighters perform stunts like Evil Knievel, but without the motorcycles. Can someone please explain to me how the main characters can be hit multiple times in the face without losing any teeth or eyes (with one exception)?  Also, how can a woman ""warrior,"" replete with Revlon make-up, Wen washed hair, and a dress size 4, do as much damage to a man as a 6'6 245 pound man?  Is there a certain kind of physics that escapes me? If there is, please let me know so that I may use it on the next big jerk who won't give up his seat for me on my next subway ride.  I would also like to know how the Romans, with all of their armor, manage to get stabbed right through while the rebels, with no armor, manage not to get stabbed at all!
  If there is one thing of worth that this lousy series teaches is that arrogance can bring a movement down, and rightfully so.  Spartacus and his merry band of bozos end up acting just as ugly as the very Romans that they fight against!  They become smug, self-righteous beasts as they justify every vicious act against innocent Roman villagers who've done nothing to deserve their fate!  The most irritating character of all, a Pam Grier wannabe named Navia, nearly cuts off the hand of a harmless Roman baker and then has the nerve to cry some sob story of being raped by her old master as justification for her actions! Poor, poor Navia.  Perhaps if there was rape counseling back in those days she'd be able to scribble through her anger with art therapy as a more constructive alternative to putting some poor guy 'under the knife', so to speak. Maybe then, she can blame the paper instead for her rape, since she's clearly a woman who likes to place blame elsewhere instead of looking at herself in the mirror.
  Is there any reason why the writers chose to use silly stereotypes of gay men as couples?  There were two such couples, and both consisted of a tall, strong, ""manly"" man and a small, boyish, more ""feminine"" man.  Now, I don't know about you all out there, but I've known gay couples and none of them fit this stereotype.  They are as varied as any straight couple, and individuals.
  Now, to be fair, Season One and the prequel containing the backstory of Spartacus' owners were engaging enough, but Season Two was bad and Season Three was beyond the pale!
  For anyone out there who wants to see a strong retelling of Spartacus, Stanley Kubrick's film is the way to go.  This Starz production is yet another sad reminder of the creative void that now ensnares Hollywood.  Hopefully, Starz can do better with productions like Power, Black Sails, and Outlander.",1424736000,,3676,4.635802469135802

5556272,4,B00B52F278,"So, here we are, the third season of ""Spartacus"".  The story picks up after the bloody events of last season's finale.  Batiatus has fallen.  Spartacus and his companions have managed to escape from Capua.  The former gladiators and house slaves are in hiding.  Meanwhile, on the Roman side of things, Ilythia and her escorts have managed to escape to safety.  Praetor Gaius Glabber has been given the task of hunting down the escaped slaves.  Ashur, the Syrian, is looking for his next meal ticket.  And Oenamaus wanders Capua, lost and empty.

Tensions are high within the refuge hideout.  Food is scarce.  The former slaves are divided as to what their next move should be.  Meanwhile, Crixus pines for his lost Naivea.  Spartacus has to prove his leadership skills once again to keep the group together.  Praetor Glabber and his men arrive from Rome to deal with the rebel slaves once and for all, dragging the pregnant Ilythia back to Capua.  Two old enemies resurface unexpectedly, offering aid to Glabber in his task to hunt down the rebels.

This is an action show.  On that there is no doubt.  Certainly there is much more action here than ""Game of Thrones"".  There is also drama.  Enough soap to wash dirt and grime off of Spartacus and his merry band.  Acting performances are terrific.  The beautiful Viva Bianca plays the ambitious and crafty Ilythia to perfection.  And Liam McIntyre has now owned the role of Spartacus and made it his.  The treacherous Ashur is well-played by Nick Tarabay.  Whereas the ambitious, but unlucky, Gaius Claudius Glabber is played by the veteran Craig Parker.

The former slaves are in hiding outside the city, increasing their numbers by liberating male slaves who are fit to fight.  Spartacus has his hands full trying to keep the many different ethnic groups together.  On the other side of the fence, Praetor Gaius has problems of his own. Powerful politicians Varinius and Albinius seek to undermine his stature within the Roman senate.  Meanwhile, Ilythia looks for a way out of their marriage to pursue a more promising prospect.  Crixus learns that Naivea is alive and Spartacus must decide if it is worth risking everyone's safety to try and rescue her from the mines.  A legendary figure from the past makes an appearance in Capua just as the city is in the midst of panic.  Which side will he choose?

Highly recommended.",1423353600,,2377,4.833333333333333

5556284,5,B00B52F278,"I love this series, pretty much all the way through. The blu-ray set includes a lot of nice commentary, which I love including some from Dan Feuerriegel (Agron) one of my favorite actors in the series. The little extras are nice, the menu is not obnoxious, has that stylized art and one of the better tracks from the series. Now if you are like me at all, in that you watched Season 1 and 2 while it ran but kind of fell off during 3 and 4 (I labeling 2 as the prequel) then let me tell you it's worth going back. This series could have easily blown up or just fell apart after the tragedy with Andy, but they pulled it together really well. Three and Four are my favorite by far, and even though anyone who knows anything about this time period knows what happens to this rebellion, this was not an exercise in the inevitable. The writers, the actors, producers/directions, everyone involved merged history with vision and fantasy (not magic but imagination) into something that has just enough surprise, violence and sexiness to keep the series fresh all the way to the end. I am not even a lady hugely into blood and guts, gore in general... I don't even watch horror films, but the way the violence fit into this world and time... sold me.

 I was a big fan of the series Rome, and I feel like if Rome had the commitment, resource wise, to go four reasons that would have wrapped up nicely as this one did. A part of me almost feels like it could have gone one more season... but I also fear that could have been a tipping point because this was satisfactory all the way through.",1421539200,2,1583,4.344594594594595

seasons 2&3 but the 2nd Spartacus actor does BOTH 2&3 which is wonderful and keeps you interested in the tale. I loved this series but was sad that the first actor for Spartacus wasn't in the repeat Seasons, the same can be said for Cryptus' love the slave girl.",1419724800,,404,4.328947368421052

5556305,4,B00B52F278,"Finally, in this season they have shed the apparent insecurity that compelled the writers to cram an unforgivable amount of smut and gore into the plot to sell a historical fiction to the general public in the first three seasons (there is a prequel season).  There is still plenty of smut and gore in this one, but it's not quite as embarrassingly pervasive.  This cast is awesome despite the hodgepodge of accents.  You get used to the weird speech eventually, and it's totally worth it.  I love that every episode moves at breakneck speed.  This show does not do that thing that Heroes did where the plot just crawls along and ten episodes in you figure out that they don't really have a plan.  Spartacus is bold and well done.",1419465600,,730,4.576923076923077

5556307,5,B00B52F278,"Wow, that is a great show.  I was a little skeptical about the show when I first heard they were making this show.  But wow, I was blown away with the story line.  I also did some research about the show being historically correct and yes, it's very close.  And what I mean is the show portrays the Romans and gladiators very close to the real deal.  It's not perfect but from what I read, it's close.  Two things are a little off.  Gladiators did not shave them selves, that is why the Romans called the gladiators beast because there were so hairy.  And, the gladiators did not dies as often as the show portrays.  About 2/3 of the fights were NOT to the death.  I would highly recommend this to anyone, you just have to get past the most T&A of any show every on paid TV!",1419292800,,774,4.168918918918919

The acting is superb and the story is almost obsessively compelling. The breakout star of this is Dan Feuerriegel, who has become my current favorite actor. I cannot wait to see what he does next.  He's just amazing, along with Liam McIntyre, Dustin clare, Peter mensah Pana Hema Taylot and Manu bennet.

However in the finale season I thought that Liam McIntyre grew into the role as Spartacus and did a fine job. I thought the series could have lasted one more season but so be it.

The new Naevia is possibly the worst actress I have ever seen on a television show, obviously a graduate of the William Shatner school of overacting.

This season definitely seemed like more of a graphic novel/comic book come to life whereas B&S and Gods of the Arena seemed more like a true to life story to me.",1408838400,2,511,4.333333333333333

I remember seeing the trailer for this series & saying wow spartacus,  not a long time after the 300 made me proud & that they left a blood line through 480 B.C. till the end of time!. Watch the first episode of this & we shall speak again! In the same cinematography as the 300 style.  The real Spartacus was born in the Greek province of thrace, in those days it was a common name, it derived from the respect of  SPARTA . Hence the name. He was put into slavery from the age of 9!. & then working like an animal in the salt mines. Then his story, a story that changed & Put the dangerous question into mankind's mind's Die on your feet than live on your knees?.

As most of us know, television by enlarge and its idea of theater is mostly badly done, it is a pleasure to see real theater on cable television.  I in particular, with all of the 'Spartacus Productions', admire the adult-hood quality of actual Ancient Roman Culture' , instead of some watered down version implying Ancient Roman Culture  if sex offends you, even though sex is a very human activity and psychology, then simply don't watch any of the 'Spartacus' film productions  this type of theater production requires an open mind.",1404345600,,877,5.184397163120567

After that the story telling was good enough to keep my attention. The characters are not as strong, and the fight scenes leave you wanting, where the thrill seems to have been replaced with shock-effect violence. That's not to say that there aren't moments where you won't laugh or say ""Man I didn't see that coming"" or ""Wow that was cool"", you'll just find yourself feeling that a lot less than the first two seasons.",1403740800,,537,4.434343434343434

5556448,2,B00B52F278,I can see why the ratings plummeted when Season 3 came out.  There has always been spurting blood on Spartacus but with this season they seem to have increased the gratuitous blood and gore factor by a huge margin.  Perhaps this was their way of compensating for weaker writing and more absurd plot lines.  Liam McIntyre does a decent job in both Season 2 and 3 but Andy Whitfield was perfect in the role.  R.I.P.

When I purchased season 3, I found it was not as good as the other two seasons.  The dialogue is awkward.  They drop the articles (a, an, the) to some how make it more authentic, but it just sounds idiotic.  They also tend to use far more metaphors when they speak than what I remembered from the first two seasons.

I also enjoyed the artistry of the first two seasons, they made the battle scenes appear somewhat graceful in their movements, but this time something is lacking.

Overall, it is only ok.  I bought the third season to see the conclusion, but honestly, I think in the future I'll only watch seasons 1 and 2.",1402704000,3,755,4.427536231884058

Andy Whitfield was absolutely great as Spartacus and it was very sad that he departed this life at such an early age. Liam Mcintyre was great as well but I think he was too serious.

He passed away and they were such a hit that they kept going with Liam Mcintyre as Spartacus for 3 more seasons. Since it is sort of following history it has to end but i hated to see it. They did an awesome job in this final season. Please buy all 4 seasons. The blood shots are a little much for me but the seasons just get better.

I have recently finished reading ""Imperium"" and ""Conspirata"" by Robert Harris, covering the Roman Politics and the story of the Roman Statesman Cicero, so I have a reasonable background of the primary characters.  The history of when Rome ruled the known world is a fascinating subject.  But, all the extremely detailed sex scenes irritated me.  This is the kind of series that could get kids really interested in history, but because of all the  x rated stuff - I would never let my kids or Grand-kids watch it.  It's too bad.  It looks like when they didn't have enough story to do an episode (or they had to fill in a lack of script's pages to make a full season) , they just added sex.",1394064000,,778,4.436619718309859

Not with Spartacus!
The producers wrapped it up superbly, and if you liked Season 1 and 2, you'll love this one. They stick pretty well to the historical accounts we have of that period and when they change something, it is for better dramatic results.

Spartucus is on the run from a new Roman leader and Julisus Ceasar. Spartucus was still able to play a good cat and mouse game. Thought Ceasar should have done a lot more to show why he was able to lead Rome but this is still a Spartucus story.

At Girl's Movie Night we play the Spartacus drinking game.....of all seasons this one left us the least inebriated after an episode.

It wasn't for lack of Gannicus's entusiam for lustful drunken debauchery (worth two drinks per scene)....oh wait...yeah it was.... he fell in love...and died very unbecoming of his character (luckily we got some drinks out of his glorious pyhrric victory). Cryxis became a dick again (which meant more drinking to ""my dick is bigger than yours"" dialogue), and not a single sex scene for us to drink to (he was our favorite). Without Mira, we didn't have as many stabbity drinks, but hating on Navia pulling a Yoko Ono almost balanced that out. Of course we knew Caesar wasn't gonna die...and he really didn't give many epic fight scenes to drink to the physiologically impossible gore...so that didn't leave us with as many drinks. There was the expected beefcake, random background nudity, violence and gore, but for some reason this season left us with the least amount of ""Jupiter's C**CK!"" and "" Apologies"" to drink to.",1393372800,,1381,5.165178571428571

5556526,5,B00B52F278,"This series was amazing! The graphic sex and violence is there, but then you get the feeling they were really trying to convey what life was like in that circle of violence and uprising. The ultimate battle in the final episode, helps you to see how land battles were fought. My favorite story-line, though having no real episode dedicated to them, was the same-gender couple of Agron and Nasir. their moments together were incredibly beautiful and to see Nasir grow from a 'body-slave' for a dominus into a warrior proves that you don't mess with those small in stature. The dialogue was written in almost Shakespearean poetics, so listen carefully. It's one of the many fascinating aspects of this series. ""Gratitude"" instead of 'thank you', ""Apologies"" instead of ""I'm sorry"". And ""absent"" instead of 'without'. There were many, many imagery uses and how the writers managed to convey so much of it throughout 4 seasons (I'm including the prequel between 1 & 2 when the main actor of ""Blood And Sand"" took terminally ill) proves they were dedicated to staying in the zone when it came to the characters and how they communicated. I enjoyed the unveiling of the plot, though not so much the graphic blood and violence. I started getting used to it, but there were times what they did shocked me, so be aware of that going in. I jumped a few times, but if that thing intrigues you, you shouldn't have any trouble. And the fact that Michael Hurst became one of the directors as well as a producer of this show, it was fun to see signs of his directing hand at work. All in all I'm going to miss this series. It was gritty, it held nothing back, and it showed in a positive light two warriors who could love each other amongst other warriors and not be looked at twice, and be completely accepted. In one instance when Agron is injured, he's leaning on Spartacus' shoulder, as he's brought back to the base, but when Nasir approaches, there's a small moment (blink and you'll miss it) where you see Spartacus lay Agron's arm on Nasir's shoulder, as though saying 'I place him in your care, now, Nasir.' Spartacus understood their affection for each other and never said anything about it. It was accepted in those times. A beautiful scene. You never see Spartacus' face during that moment, just his hands gently resting Agron's arm on Nasir's shoulder. But you don't have to see Spartacus to get the meaning there. It's a subtle gesture, but really touched my heart. The respect and understanding, the acceptance of it all. There are quirks, quarrels, disagreements, it's all there amongst the 'brotherhood', but it binds them stronger. It's not just about the politics, or the battles, or the sex, it's about the forging of former slaves into a united front. Highly recommended if you can stomach the graphic violence and nudity. As I said, they hold nothing back on those two counts, but the story lines more than make up the balance.",1393372800,,2935,4.7009708737864075

Season 3 (Spartacus: Vengeance) is the second or third season depending on how you score them of Spartacus. This season follows Spartacus: Blood and Sand storyline. Spartacus (played by Liam McIntyre, who replaces the late Andy Whitfield), after he and his fellow gladiators kill their master Batiatus and escape from his ludus, or gladiatorial training school.

There are too many films of unworldly powers where the story changes with some new created power. Spartacus was different as I enjoyed the underdog role he played and that he did not get caught up incorruption when he obtained power. James Bond is cool even though some of it is unbelievable. Much appreciated viewing for me!!",1390694400,,642,5.123809523809523

5556564,5,B00B52F278,i now have the complete set..the whole storyline is about freedom..yes it may be a bit x-rated and gory..but the freedom and being equal is most important...great acting...hope there is a sequel,1390435200,,194,5.09375
5556565,5,B00B52F278,Spartacus was a really ground breaking TV series. I collected all 4 seasons so I can replay them whenever I'm in the mood for some visceral action and intrigue.,1390348800,,160,4.551724137931035

I appreciate the fact that the series needed to end and  I assumed that Spartacus was going to get it in the end, but  it all seemed so lame in the way the writers depicted the end. I will say that the series overall was very entertaining and engaging. The finale did not do justice to the series.",1390262400,2,368,4.318840579710145
5556569,4,B00B52F278,I am sad to see this series come to an end.  I got into this series when It first started and have been hooked ever since. Actually it was the only reason I kept Starz.  It was really tragic that Andy Whitfield passed away at such a young age and prayers go to his family. It was a hard adjustment to have a new person playing the lead character of Spartacus but Liam Mcintyre did a good job.  This final season was non-stop action.  I wasn't happy with the ultimate ending but I know it eventually had to happen.,1390262400,2,513,4.151515151515151
5556570,5,B00B52F278,"I am watching this final season for the first time and I am up to episode 9 out of 10.  Having just finished episode 8 am I exhausted!  Yes, I cried.  Don't worry I won't spoil anything so please keep reading.  I have every season on bluray and watched all previous seasons many times as I'm sure I'll watch this one too.  I have no idea which season is the best, they all have drama...and all shock me.  I have laughed, cried, yelled, and my girlfriend has screamed....yes, my girlfriend not me!  LOL  I have lost count at how many times I've said 'OMG!'

This final season has been no different, it's an emotional roller coaster!  Drama all the way.  I am left drained and exhausted at the end of each episode (my girlfriend who is now a big fan).Some of the characters behaviours have changed...for example....Crixus has become more savage and war hungry compared to his quieter days in previous seasons.  He has always been calm and resisted battle for the sake of it but in this season he's always wanting to take on all the Romans regardless of the situation.  How the characters have changed is part of the intrigue.  They have grown and adapted to the lifestyle and the environment they now live in.

The epsiode I watched today...#8.... OMG!  Over the last couple of years we have watched these characters go through so much.  They have loved eachother, hated eactother, lost eachother....and we all know the history behind Spartacus and how it will all end.  So now we are reaching that end...we know what's coming.  I just didn't think it would hit me so hard.  Yes, I cried...a little!  My girlfriend couldn't even look at the closing scenes....it's so entertaining, thrilling, emotional......and we still have 2 episodes to go!  It really is exhausting!

Congrats to the writers, directors (multiple) and of course the actors.  This has been the best ever TV experience I have ever been a part of.  Other shows such as The Walking Dead, Rome, Lost, Suprano's,...all huge successes.....but without doubt...for me.... Spartacus is way ahead.... it truly is amazing!  I just don't know when I'll be ready to watch episode #9 of this season.....the drama is killing me.  I'm going to have to man up!  LOL

So....if you have to buy the bluray or watch it at a friends house.... it doesn't matter....just watch it!

Awesome!",1390089600,,2331,4.712158808933003

5556580,3,B00B52F278,"I have to say, I like it better watching it on Blu-ray than I did on TV. The Blu-ray brings out visual nuances that I missed on the regular broadcast.  Still, the third season is not up to par with season one or the prequel. Don't even get me started on season twoor you can read my pretty negative review if you wish.

The cause, I think, is a chopped budget and the fact that de Knight was not as inivolved in writing. Big events and big characters are crammed into a small space and truncated timeline. Neither characters nor events are developed to their fullest. It is such a disappointment to see a series that started with such potential and audience support end on a whimper because of short sighted management.

I find no fault with the acting, however. McIntyre does a fine job as do all the other leads. Naevia comes into her own, and I actually began to like the character.

So, if you collected the previous seasons, go ahead and get this. It's worth it just to complete the set.",1389571200,,992,4.375

If you don't mind over the top violence and in some cases of graphic nudity, you can appreciate the great writing, acting, action and visually stunning scenes. Even with the change of lead actors, Spartacus was too well done not to continue. I really miss this show. Starz's version of Spartacus was compelling and entertaining. If they ever do a similar series, even using the same actors, I'm there.

The blu-ray special features are good, but by far, the audio commentaries are the best. Especially with the actors. I laughed my ass off a few times. Especially the ""out gunned"" comments.",1389052800,,708,4.574803149606299

5556651,5,B00B52F278,"Alongside&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tudors-The-Complete-Series/dp/B0042RJWTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tudors: The Complete Series</a>, this is one of the most well done & ambitious series ever produced by  a premium movie channel.  Unlike Henry the VIII, however, there are far more missing details to the life of Spartacus.  We really don't have any idea of what went on within the Thracian's camp as we don't have any 1st hand accounts.  Everything we know, we only know from the Roman point-of-view.

This is both good & bad.  While we don't know the names of the gladiators & other Roman slaves who fought with Spartacus, I can't help but think that this series is an excellent REPRESENTATION of the types of discussions that must have transpired inside of Spartacus' inner-circle.  The series brings these long-dead heroes to life, and that is precisely the point.

Liberties are taken with the one Gauis Julius Caesar, but that is all well & good as he's one of the few historical figures in the series (aside from Spartacus himself) who is a household name.  Meanwhile, the depictions of Crassus & Pompey are historically accurate, at least in the broad historical sense.  Marcus Crassus DID resort to decimating his own men, and Crassus & Pompey did team-up to defeat the gladiator army.  {As a sidenote, the 3 men together would go on to form what would become known as the ""First Triumverate"" which was a sort of bridge between the Roman Republic & the age of the Caesars}

The acting in the series is terrific, with two alumni from the movie ""300"" included.  Both genders are bound to be entranced as the series is filled to top with buffed up gladiators & gorgeous women.  Of the latter, Gwendoline Taylor debuts in this season as Sibyl.  I must say, I was absolutely mesmerized by this New Zealand beauty!!  I can't wait to see her in more projects.

The SPARTACUS series invokes everything that the time period was famous (or infamous?) for:  gladiatorial games, Roman baths, orgies, torture / crucifixion and the Romans trying to impose their will on the rest of the world.  As such, the series does not pull any punches when it comes to violence, blood, gore & nudity (in fact, virtually every single actress in the series strips-down @ one time or other!).  People who want their history watered down into a ""G Rated"" version should look elsewhere.

This is a spectacular series, one that belongs up there with other Roman epics such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ben-Hur-1959/dp/B001I808QY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ben Hur (1959)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator/dp/B005DNO7MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gladiator</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Claudius-35th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B006JY3OHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Claudius (35th Anniversary Edition)</a>.

In the present age, the motto of the United States Army GREEN BERETS is ""To free the oppressed.""  Spartacus would have smiled upon such a motto.  That we still have brave soldiers today who wish to eradicate slavery and human hardship is a testament to the human will to resist tyranny.  It is also a testament to Spartacus himself:  a man who went on to become much more legendary than the 2 Legates who ultimately defeated him.

5556673,4,B00B52F278,"While I preferred the first two seasons and the prequel, I was just as engaged in this season.  I think the only drop-off was knowing that it was the final season so while watching, I kept thinking ""all these characters are going to die.""  Despite that notion, it was still full of surprises and much of the premise is fairly accurate to history (at least what we know of Spartacus.)

""Spartacus:  War of the Damned"" picks up where season two left off.  It has been about one year since the beginning of the slave rebellion initiated by the gladiators and slaves who overthrew the House of Batiatus.  As the rebellion swells, Spartacus, Crixus, Agron, and Gannicus agree they must find a larger base for their band of slaves.  In Rome, the senate desperately names Marcus Crassus leader of the Army against Spartacus.  Crassus enlists Gaius Julius Caesar into his army, along with Crassus' repulsive son, Tiberius.

After Spartacus and his men take their city, they seek assistance from a gang of local pirates.  While meeting these pirates outside city walls, Tiberius leads an attack against the rebels but fails to hold his ranks.  Once rejoined with his father's army, Crassus commands a display of decimation for Tiberius and his men.  The slyness of Marcus Crassus begins to be revealed as he slips Caesar into the slave city as a spy pretended to be one of the rebels.  Caesar causes upset among the slaves, driving Crixus and Spartacus to quarrels over their purposes.

Once the city falls at Crassus' hand, the rebel army becomes trapped in a snowy ridge; they begin to freeze and starve.  The rift between Spartacus and Crixus grows.  Spartacus devises a plan to lead his army over the snowy ridge.  Once escaped, the rebel army splits between Spartacus and Crixus.

As far as overviewing the season, I have elected to stop here because the final 2-3 episodes wrap up the entire series--well worth the watch.  What I found most interesting about season 3 is the ability of the writers to truly expose the depth of the characters; those you may have previously thought you hated now become those you love, and vice versa.  This is a show that stays in the mind long after it's over because it is hard to definitively point to ""what is right"" and ""what is wrong.""  I also thought some of the battle ploys used by each army were genius, and surprises are plenty.",1382400000,3,2369,4.701456310679611

5556678,1,B00B52F278,"This was the most boring season and a waste of time. The previous seasons were fun to watch since they mostly covered the period of time from Spartacus life about which there are no facts to verify the accuracy. The final season is a waste of time and is good only for 10 year olds. To get an idea here are two stupid moments from the movie: 1) Julius Caesar acts as some kind of commando, who gets to the castle, held by Spartacus, pretending to be a slave and helps roman forces to take the castle from within. Another laughable situation is when Julius Caesar gets raped by Crassus's spoiled son when they get into argument. The rest of the season is in this manner. They could have made the season interesting and educational if they have followed at least some historic accuracy, but instead they decided to make this a chip action movie, and after a while you get bored watching similar types of fights when bunch of rebels slay many more roman soldiers all over again. Also in the movie they show roman soldiers fight by running towards the rebels (the same manner that rebels do), and breaking their orders. Keeping the order and marching slowly towards the animal being covered by shields was the main advantage of roman legions, so why would they give away this advantage.",1382227200,7,1282,4.554112554112554

Have you seen the movie Gladiator. No doubt if you have seen it once you have seen it several times. Like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones and to a lesser extent Walking Dead this belongs in the Best Ever Category of shows. Imagine a longer version of the 300! I will watch this series again. Sad to see this triumph of Television end. The Action, Sex, Visual delights and Blood make you feel as though you are in Rome itself. It has many triumphant and sad moments. I truly don't even know how shows like Friends, and the other garbage that is popular now on regular tv can be seen after viewing Cable at its best. I have heard Sopranos many a time talked about as greatest. I do not have it there, I have spoken on what I feel is better.

5556686,5,B00B52F278,"I'm going to keep this review very brief and just say that the final season of Spartacus is a truly bittersweet one.  After the somewhat uneven ""Vengeance"" I was glad to see ""War of The Damned"" end the series back on a really high note.  Given the way everything ultimately played out though (not that we didn't know it was coming) it was really emotional to witness so many of the characters I had come to love see their final end.  My hats off to STARZ and the creative team behind the Spartacus series who really elevated the material to must see entertainment.  Both Andy Whitfield and Liam McIntire truly excelled at portraying Spartacus-each in his own unique way.  Andy will always be the original and was sorely missed when he passed away, but Liam having had some giant shoes to fill-stepped in and ultimately hit his own stride.  I will miss this show and all the great and supremely memorable characters it introduced.  Likewise, I will miss the intricate scheming plots of the first couple of seasons and the insane over the top warrior fighting scenes from the later ones.  (Not to mention the gratuitous sex and violence)  So long Spartacus!  You will be missed.

The difficulty for me is the gore and blood (yes and guts), I found myself having mixed emotions about the series because of its extreme violence...this is not a family time show.",1381968000,,496,4.550561797752809

If you saw Vengeance, then you know it was TOTALLY unrealistic and beyond the bounds of believability to think the chicks back then where these fearsome fighters going up against Rome's best warriors!!!! I mean, really! The only thing I liked about vengeance is that Spartacus' rat-faced love-interest got killed!!! Yeah SPOILER ALERT!!!

But now we have even MORE testing of credibility when we're asked to believe that Navea.....the 90lb sopping-wet, sniveling slave girl (who isn't even the original Navea), is now a fearsome gladiatrix (yeah right) slaying mountains of well-trained, STRONG, muscle-bound Roman soldiers???? C'mon people....give me a freaking break!! It was bad enough in Vengeance when she killed Ashur....ASHUR.....A FREAKING FULL-FLEDGED GLADIATOR who not four episode earlier had beaten three Roman Soldiers....and now this???? This chick RUINS the show!!!!

In the first episode of this last season (thankfully), I counted no less than six Eagles they had captured from the Romans. Are you freaking KIDDING ME?!?!?! Jesus Christ....what the hell were the producers thinking?! I SO wanted Navea to die off earlier, and save me the aggravation of always having to yell ""BS"" at the TV when she would beat 2, 3, 5, 7 MEN...all warriors! But hey...at least she had an annoying screech when she'd cut them down!! Ugh, what a COLOSSAL disappointment!!!

And what's with Crassus and his wife? They're spitting images of Glaber and Illythia! Honestly....the ONLY one who added some interest to the show was the guy that played a Gaius Julius (a young Julius Caesar).

Except for Crixus and Gannicus, all the main characters are dead or have left the show....so enjoy the 10 episode slog through a non-stop blood- and sex-filled show that's trying it's best to compensate for the loss of Whitfield at the cost of having a good cast and believable performance!!!

The last season delivers the usual array of blood and guts and solid acting, a great balance that most of these types of shows lack.

HBO's ROME series did much of the same. Although only 2 seasons, it was very memorable and well done. But STARZ picked up where HBO's ROME left off, delivering more action and bang for your buck.

Hot bodies, beautiful men and women, the scenery and costume was incredible.  The dialog was beautiful, vulgar and brutal.  The music overture was outstanding (so much so that I bought it).  Every night a new episode came on I watched it over again because it aired again on STARZ.  Talk about sitting on the edge of your chair, screaming or cheering at the TV, having a full hour go by in an instant, and then having to wait a week to see the next episode was a killer.  I enjoyed this theatrical version so much that it inspired me to read a book on the history of the Spartacus wars. This is one of the most well produced series EVER!  If you are a woman you will become a fan of some of the hottest men on screen.  If you are a man you will become a fan of some of the most beautiful women on screen.

STARZ' Spartacus tells the tale of a Thracian gladiator who led his fellow slaves in an uprising from 73 to 71 BC. After the fall of Roman commander Gaius Claudius Glaber in Spartacus: Vengeance, the rebels have amassed victory after victory and struck fear in the hearts of their former masters. The legend of Spartacus has begun to spread throughout the land, causing thousands of slaves to take up arms for his cause. Roman General Marcus Crassus joins forces with Julius Caesar to take down the Bringer of Rain once and for all - and he proves to be the only man able to match the Thracian in both swordsmanship and intellect. Now Spartacus: War of the Damned has finally arrived on Blu-ray, and its ten fantastic final episodes are rounded out by a host of great features.

Spartacus: War of the Damned is an incredible final season, where every episode is stronger than the last, building towards an epic, emotional finale. Liam McIntyre continues in the role of Spartacus from Season 2, and the cast also features Manu Bennett (Crixus), Dustin Clare (Gannicus), Dan Feuerriegel (Agron), Simon Merrells (Crassus), Todd Lasance (Caesar) and Cynthia Addai-Robinson as Naevia.

The picture and sound quality are quite good here. The widescreen 1.78:1 1080p image looks sharp and vivid without being oversaturated. The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless audio track is phenomenal, with clear dialogue, a bombastic soundtrack and explosive sound effects that fill out the sound field -  it's sure to give your home theater system a workout.

As for  the special features, there are six featurettes and Blu-ray exclusive audio commentaries, as well as extended episodes. Spartacus: The Legend Retold is essentially a primer that I'm assuming was aired prior to the season's airing on STARZ. It tells the origins of the Spartacus show, the cast talks about their favorite moments from the series thus far, and also a bit about the transition from the Andy Whitfield era to Liam McIntyre's take on the role. It also goes into the six-episode prequel series Gods Of The Arena, where Dustin Clare's Gannicus took center stage to give Whitfield time off. The Price Of Being A Gladiator is a short chat with some of the cast, as they talk about how physically difficult the Spartacus boot camp is that prepares them for their roles, and how it helps them bond as a group and toughen up for their on-screen battles. They also share some insight into the multitude of injuries that they sustained while filming, from black eyes to broken ribs.

A Bloody Farewell sees the cast lamenting the end of the show, and looking back fondly on their great times spent together. The Spoils of War: Revealed goes into the visual effects and how the CGI works to elevate the show visually, beyond what would be normally possible on a stage set. Adorning The Damned sheds light on the intricate costume designs that are created for the show, and shows off some of the incredible details in the outfits that fans may have missed. The Mind Behind Spartacus is a bit of an interview with showrunner and creator  Stephen S. DeNight, talking about his ideas, new characters and storyline concepts for the final season, as well as some of his favorite moments.

As with past Spartacus releases, the package is enclosed in a plastic outer sleeve, and when it is removed, the three-disk collection opens up like a book. The inside is adorned with promotional images of the cast, and the front cover features a menacing photo of Liam McIntyre as Spartacus, with raised lettering. The ten episodes included have a total runtime of 562 minutes, and the video is not rated.

Very few shows have consistently entertained and engaged me like Spartacus has. The series has consistently, over three seasons and a prequel series, defied expectations and delivered one of the most action-packed, well-acted historical dramas ever to grace the small screen. It's even survived the unfortunate passing of the original lead actor, the late Andy Whitfield. With many great shows having been canceled before their time, I'm glad to see that Spartacus was able to end on its own terms. The Spartacus: War of the Damned Blu-ray is a stellar presentation and package for a mesmerizing, very deserving show, and all fans of the series will definitely want to pick it up.",1380931200,,4355,4.880920162381597
5556730,3,B00B52F278,"I enjoyed Season 1 and the prequel was fine.

5556745,5,B00B52F278,"This last season of Spartacus is just as thrilling, just as beautiful, and just as jawdropping as its predecessors. As the season opens Spartacus has gathered thousands of rebellious slaves and is trying to find a way to feed them as winter sets in. In the meantime, Rome has commissioned its wealthiest citizen, Senator Crassus, to deal with the advancing army. Crassus is a more worthy opponent to the clever hero, and he has nearly as many tricks up his sleeve as Spartacus. In addition he's aided by a young and impetuous Julius Caesar, who sneaks in to the rebel camp and acts as a spy. Brilliant.

All of the acting is sublime -- not a bad performance anywhere. Liam McIntyre manages to embody a man who kills for a living and a hobby, yet still seems the most humane person in the room. The sidekicks are still here (Gannacus, Agron, Crixus, etc.) and there is still plenty of skin, both in softcore sex scenes and gory battle sequences, with CGI adding depth and texture to these classic settings. There are pirates and battles, and love and hate, and gorgeous guys speaking Shakespeare-ese.

5556757,5,B00B52F278,"I have watched the entire Spartacus series and loved every minute of it!!  The first 2 seasons rank as my favorites, but McIntyre, who replaced the original Spartacus after his untimely death from cancer does a more than admirable job!  He had the most difficult job in replacing a character who we had all grown accustomed to and pulled it off. You can see him getting better in each episode until the final episode where he achieves glory in the ultimate finale!!!
  I will note a similarity between this and another of my favorite shows, The Walking Dead. In the WD, you would expect it to be about Zombies and gore, but it's not!!  The thing that makes the show are all the story lines taking place and the emotional attachment you make to the characters.  Same thing in Spartacus. You think of it as fighting and bloodshed. While there is more than enough of that to satisfy your bloodlust, it's the secondary stories and plots that are taking place that enthrall you and have you either loving or hating the characters. Sadly, this was the last season and I will forever remember Spartacus for all of it's glory!!",1380067200,,1119,4.597989949748744

5556760,4,B00B52F278,"Spartacus: War of the Damned, well, I think by now everyone know's or realizes that the Starz Spartacus series is ""over the top"" on all levels, but still, it is my guilty pleasure.  In the special features section one of the creators admits to adding too much sex to the series, which is funny because in the HBO series ""ROME"" (which is an amazing and extraordinary and superbly acted series) the historical consultant mentions that he doesn't think there is enough sex in that series. It is true, there is a lot of sex, violence and gore in the series, but what I like about the series is that they do a great job of portraying the ancient Roman social attitudes at the end of the Republic and into the first century the way that it was.  I felt that what they portrayed and how they portrayed the ancient Romans was pretty much the way they were, and right in line with what I've studied.

I have a particular taste for great drama, period drama etc., however, SWOD isn't so much about the ""upstairs, downstairs"" dramatics as it is about the sword fighting and the war and conflict.  SWOD at this point now, is outside and takes place largely in fields of battle and so fourth. Therefore I am inclined to say that in SWOD there is not a whole lot of dramatic context, but loads of action, blood and gore. Therefore, for me, the last two episodes in SWOD, episodes 9 and 10 were the best of this installment because of it's dramatic elements.  I have read online or seen interviews online where the actors mentioned that SWOD demanded more acting skills from them because it was a little more dramatic and emotional, that it required them to really put their acting chops to the test.  Those last two episodes are quite sad, and for a number of reasons not the least of which I think everyone kind of knows how it all ends, but also probably because they have to say goodbye to their cast mates, some of whom have been with each other from the start, knew Mr. Whitfield, etc, etc.  However, for me, dramatically, it didn't really live up to it's hype, but it certainly did with the action scenes.  In regards to the actors, Simon Merrells (who portrayed Crassus) was by far the best actor in SWOD.  There is a scene in particular where he's sparring verbally with Caesar and the camera catches and flashes his emotions and looks from different angles, one after the other,  and it is very compelling.  Todd LaSance, the young actor who portrays Caesar, is also very, very good.  Todd LaSance seems to be able to display some range in his acting abilities.  It seems that a lot of people have been critical about Liam McIntyre's interpretation of ""Spartacus"" - I believe largely because they have been, were, loyal to the late Mr. Whitfield.  However, I don't think Mr. McIntyre did a bad job.  Yes, he has similar looks as Mr. Whitfield, they both are (were-in Mr. Whitfields case) good looking men, nice bodies, etc, etc., but in regards to their acting abilities, I personally don't see much difference.  In my opinion, the part of ""Spartacus"" isn't exactly ""Hamlet"" ... he really doesn't have to display a whole lot of range ... and In ""Blood and Sand"" (in my opinion) although he did a great job, I didn't see a lot of rang in the part of Spartacus.  The actress who portrayed Naevia, Ms. Robinson, did a great job there near the end.  In my opinion, her character and Mr. Bennett's character ""Crixus"" had lost their minds a long time ago, and they both were definitely meant for each other because they were both off their rockers.  Again, Ms. Robinson is another actress who replaced an actress before her who performed the role of Naevia.  It seems that Ms. Robinson's look is compared to that of Ms. Brandt (the actress who portrayed Naevia in the previous installments) and it seems that the fans who were loyal to Ms. Brandt would have liked for her to have continued in that role, but Ms. Brandt left for other projects ... and I read that she didn't think the role ""spicy"" enough.  Well, it wasn't til it was ... especially towards the end of the series, and I think Ms. Robinson did a good job at portraying her loss and suffering, plus making me believe that she just basically was nuts all around.

Although well done, SWOD is not my favorite installment. ""Blood and Sand"" is my favorite installment, being the most dramatic and having the most ""upstairs/downstairs"" intrigue.  My favorite being the conflict between Ilythia, Licinia and Lucretia.  Those girls were just b***hes. Plain and simple. ""Gods of the Arena"" would be my next favorite, and ""Vengeance"" coming in third. Ilythia, Lucretia and Glaber getting what they deserve at the end of ""Vengeance"" was wonderful.  All in all I believe it is worth watching.  Some of the critics of the series say that it is soft porn or very close to it.  Well, in my opinion, I'd agree with that, which is why it is my guilty pleasure.

5556764,5,B00B52F278,"How do you say farewell to an epic fan-favorite show?  That is a question the producers of the SPARTACUS series have probably been dwelling upon for a while now.  WAR OF THE DAMNED is the third and final season of this blood-soaked drama, and it does not disappoint.  Chocked full of battles, blood, and brutality, this is one show that I am very sad to see end.

This series is truly impressive on many levels.  It is visually amazing, the bloodshed and gore are superb, the drama is intense, and the acting is top notch.  But the storyline never gets stale, either.  It moves at rapid pace, but not so fast as to lose the audience.  The result is an amazing show that is as engrossing as it is vicious.

As with its predecessors, SPARTACUS: WAR OF THE DAMNED is shot well and looks stunning onscreen.  The historical backdrops are vivid and set the stage for a realistic journey back in time.  This allows for full immersion into Spartacus' world, and thus grants a rich entertainment experience.

Liam McIntyre once again does a perfect job with the role of Spartacus, and he is surrounded by a stellar cast.  I am happy to see McIntyre finish out the role that Andy Whitfield started; McIntyre does the deceased actor a great honor by flourishing in the Spartacus mantle.  I would wager that Whitfield would be pleased.

SPARTACUS: WAR OF THE DAMNED is a definite win for me, although I am sad to acknowledge it is the final season of this blockbuster show.  If you are not watching the series already, do yourself a favor and pick them all up for a good week's worth of binge-watching.

!!!Naevia!!! - Cynthia Addai-Robinson does a magnificent job this season! As much as I enjoyed Lesley-Ann Brandt in BaS and GoA, I'm not sure she could have pulled off the rabid killing-machine that Naevia became this season.

Simon Merrells is excellent as Marcus Crassus, Anna Hutchison does a fine job as Laeta, Christian Antidormi excelles as Tiberius, and Todd Lasance  is very good as an inappropriately blonde Julius Caesar (sorry, Ciaran Hinds now owns the role of Caesar, and blonde just doesn't work).

5556784,3,B00B52F278,"The Spartacus saga comes to an end with WAR OF THE DAMNED. Although it is called the third season of SPARTACUS, there were four seasons including the prequel.

Spartacus and his warriors are now free and moving about the countryside. The bloody battles continue and the former slaves attempt to destroy the Roman Empire. In War of the Damned, the ex-slaves have become as brutal as their former masters. When they overtake a Roman city, no mercy is shown to the Roman citizens. Only the slaves in the city have a chance. The brutality of this season seems to overshadow everything else. The hatred and need for revenge are so strong.

SPARTACUS has been a remarkable series. It's visual effects and authentic costumes and sets have been like no other. All the limits on violence and sex have been pushed to the extreme, but now it seems like it is time for Spartacus to end. The bloodletting is no longer so shocking and the sex has been toned down. Most of the actresses still get to do full frontals but the extremes, especially from Season one, have ended.

The series seems to be lost as the warriors meander across the Roman empire. The gladiators are gone. Many of the characters from past seasons who added such spice to the show are gone. The show is hanging together by threads. It's just one battle after another followed by one betrayal after another.

The show wraps ups the saga the best it can. Some of our heroes survive, others don't. It finally comes to an end and the glory of Rome is left to fate.

The end has come and the show's creativity has been exhausted. There would be no need for another season. This set had a few extras that were rather dull and lifeless..more of the wonders of the special effects and the physical hardships of the actors. My big disappointment is the fact that there was no tribute to the original Spartacus Andy Whitfield, who died in 2011. It was his illness that led the producers to do a prequel so Whitfield could be treated and return as Spartacus. Sadly, Whitfield never recovered. Although he is mentioned briefly in the history of the series, he deserved a tribute and more of a mention in the extras on this DVD set.

No one can deny that SPARTACUS was a remarkable achievement in TV history. The quality of the actors, costumes, visual effects and sets rival anything seen on the big screen. This was an incredible series that lost its fizz in the final season. Goodbye, Spartacus and friends. You took us on a sensational journey.",1379116800,5,2491,4.586516853932585

5556786,5,B00B52F278,"Title translation, Latin to English: ""THE SPARTACUS LEGEND IN FULL, GHASTLY, BEAUTIFUL DETAIL""

(ALSO, this review covers all three seasons)

SPARTACUS is a giant leap for viewers of any screen, to maybe or maybe-not approve of. It's a paradigm-changer. Above all it seems REAL. Every scene, costume, background and kind of behavior is made real by thorough uncompromising historical research.

Social, sexual, spiritual, government/politics, behavior, manners and mores are represented as were in 70 B.C. Details all attended. SPARTACUS' three seasons are all painstakingly written, art-directed, artistically shot. Superbly, dramatically envisioned, acted, recreated in ways that cry out THIS IS REAL. Sometimes uncomfortably real. (Something rare: No mood-reflecting background music, just the music, mostly horns, playing in that era to match action. Which works very well)

For those who can stomach gore and perversity (sex, torture, murder) there are excesses; camera tricks emphasize blood-lust. Slo-mo shots in all episodes may be too much. CGI of blood spurting, heads rolling, limbs flying, intestines flailing. For shocking, violent sex orgies (surprisingly uncensored) or hideous torture scenes - all probably for the sake of reality of Roman life in the 70's (B.C.). Vivid background depictions of crude, cruel everyday life on streets or in luxurious palatial homes and official areas of privileged patricians add layers of information and action.

There are no subtitles, just chapter titles. Far better, ingenious writing echos rhythms of spoken Latin. (60 years ago - why, I can't remember - I took Latin, vocabulary's 90% lost to me). Though I'm no linguist, the Latin cadence is conveyed in the English sound track and rhetoric seem as real as all else in this milestone production.

Beyond often shockingly lurid moments, SPARTACUS offers sharp moral lessons. Like, slavery, suppression/population exploitation, excessive anything (ego, arrogance included) doesn't work for long. In fact, such have an inevitable and awful backlash on both perps and victims.

You'll see the beauty of love, loyalty, ethics and allegiance too.

BTW, I'm no shill for upgrading video and audio electronics; but this truly magnificent mini-series seems a good reason to upgrade to a Blu-Ray player - which you probably know remarkably upgrades video and audio for most any DVD format.

SPARTACUS is the most uncompromising film/series recommendation I've ever made. BUT - Caveat Emptor. . .

This Spartacus is not for family viewing or for those with puritanical leanings or prone to psychotic violence - like, how close dare we come to porn and excessive, vivid, glorified violence in mass media? Still, SPARTACUS is a great closest-to historically-accurate presentation of seminal changes in Roman social, cultural, personal beliefs and values - while still offering incredible, engrossing, exciting entertainment. It is A Work of Art

A LastNote from the NYTimes 1000-best movies ever:

""In today's excerpt - ancient Rome was built on slavery, and slaves constituted as much as forty percent of the population. This slavery could be unspeakably gruesome, whether it was the tens of thousands of slaves that died in the Roman mines in Spain, or those that were condemned to die as gladiators, and so Rome was left to ruthlessly crush innumerable slave rebellions:

Spartacus, who was born north of Greece, in Thrace, received training in the Roman army as a barbarian 'auxiliary' (ally) before becoming a slave in 73 BCE. It's not clear why he was enslaved after serving Rome. However, his combat skills made him a natural candidate for the gladiator school at Capua, about one hundred miles from Rome.

Here Spartacus and his fellow slaves learned how to entertain a Roman audience with dramatic hand-to-hand combat. Knowing they were going to their certain deaths, however, about eighty gladiators followed Spartacus into rebellion - using kitchen utensils as weapons. Before long they armed themselves with real weapons, slaughtering Roman soldiers who tried to stop them. Then they escaped to the countryside, where Spartacus incited a general slave uprising, attracting thousands of field workers to his cause. He led the rebel slaves to a mountaintop, where they built a fortified encampment.

At first the Roman Senate viewed the uprising as a minor threat, but they soon learned better, and dispatched two commanders (praetors) to besiege the mountain and starve the slave army into submission. Spartacus launched a daring counterattack, ordering his soldiers to use vines to rappel down the side of the mountain.

Of course the Roman Senate couldn't allow the slave rebellion to succeed, as the Roman economy was increasingly based on slavery. So they dispatched a new commander, Crassus, with twelve legions - a huge force - only to have the advance force of two legions annihilated by the slave army.

(SPOILER AHEAD!)

Spartacus now led the rebels south, to Sicily, where he planned to
rendezvous with pirates he'd hired to take them to safety. But the pirates never showed, and the slaves found themselves trapped on a narrow peninsula. ... Desperate, Spartacus decided he had no choice but to fight the Romans head on. Here the Romans finally defeated the rebel army, showing no mercy as they butchered sixty thousand runaway slaves, including women and children. Sixty-six hundred survivors were crucified along the Appian Way connecting Capua to Rome. However, the body of Spartacus was never found.""

5556787,5,B00B52F278,"The strange confluence between the brutality of ancient Rome and the brutality of our time and the American consciousness (which refuses to recognize that we are precisely the same sort of evil empire which will go down in history for its bloody, sexuality exploitative and cruel nature) makes this series compelling to a lot of viewers.  The mostly true story (I don't believe Julius Gaius Caesar ever got within a hundred yards of Spartacus -- maybe he saw him in the arena) is compelling because anyone fighting against oppression is compelling.  The dialog which seems to be based on a literal translation of Latin is unusual and helps transport us back in time.  The sexuality is astoundingly raw but there are clearly depictions of sexual love although I can't really tell the difference from the way the scenes are shot.

I hate to love this series because of the sheer brutality of it and the subconscious message: hey its okay to be rapacious in every way and let me show you dozens of people who were for good and not so good reasons.

The CGI is excellent or maybe I am just getting used to accepting what is obviously a simulation.",1379116800,,1143,4.666666666666667
5556788,5,B00B52F278,"In my review of ""Vengeance"" I thought it was a great ending, everyone you love to hate got what was coming to them, who could Spartucus battle with now?....well, in ""War of the Damned"" he gets a new advesary in Crassius, a Roman general who is in many ways Spartucus' equal, in many ways I found it difficult to hate this guy, Gladius in ""Vengeance"" was easy to hate, however Crassius is likable, you sense that he hates violence but feels it necessary to defend Rome no matter how many die, Crixous & Gannacus return to help Spartucus in the quest for freedom, we get some new characters as well, the wife of a Roman leader in a town that Spartucus & his men overthrow, can't remember her name, but she is beautiful, she resembles Amy Adams but is by far the most beautiful woman on this show (they saved the best for last), we also meet Sybyl, a new slavegirl who takes a liking to Gannacus, on the Roman side we get a young Julius Ceaser, whether or not Ceaser was instrumental in Sparucus' takedown is still being debated, the guy playing Ceaser was good, but I feel he was somewhat of a rip-off of Brad Pitt's character in ""Troy"", despite this, Ceaser is portrayed as a brutal Roman, again, we can speculate, no one really knows, I would say it is more accurate to history simply because Ceaser did rule Rome for a time before being betrayed by Cassius & Brutus, we also meet Crassius' son Tiberius who is the main antagonist here, you really yearn for his demise, this guy is more brutal than his father, overall, this was a good conclusion, all good things must end, one can only wonder what Rome would have become had the gladiators got control back in 70 B.C., they came close to defeating the Roman Empire, but in the end, they didn't, I liked how this one showed how people can unite in their quest for freedom & how many were willing to die for it, it is somthing we take for granted today, but back then times were brutal, you were either a Roman elite or a slave, this is a must have for all ""Spartucus"" fans, like the previous seasons, this one is full of porn-like sex & excessive violence with added gore, nothing is held back here.",1379030400,3,2149,4.375

However, be (warned), those of you who have families and kids under the age of 16. This movie hides NOTHING!  So be forewarned. It has bouts of porn woven throughout the series. Example: full on male and female nudity, including gay sex acts, lesbian sex acts, orgies and lewdness acts. This movie is also extremely bloody and gory to the 10th power. So if you have kids, be wise and purchase with caution. I'm just being honest. Otherwise, this movie has everything a man could ever want, no disrespect to the ladies out there.

I've always liked John Hannah who portrayed Battiatus so kept on watching and was amazed at how fast I was totally involved in the show and its characters.  I don't get Starz so have anxiously awaited the DVD availability of  ""War of the Damned"" which I just watched Friday and Saturday.  WOW - even though I knew Spartacus would not have a ""happy"" ending - it was less important than how all the other characters and situations would end.

Considering the lead actor met a untimely death in real life earlier in the series, the show's producers, etc., were able to keep continuity - and I appreciated a brief revisit with Andy Whitfield as Spartacus via the ending credits.

This season took all those season up another notch.  I won't give any spoilers away, but if you know anything about history, you know how this ends.

5556813,5,B00B52F278,"This will be a review to clear up peoples questions. I will not go into the plots, twists, who stays and who leaves, or who lives and who dies. Essentially, before watching this series you should google Spartacus and get an idea on the story. That is all you need to know before seeing this series. I will also warn you that this is by far the most bloodiest series I have seen in years. But it is all in the context of what the Gladiator's are trained and purchased for. This is all needed. I will also warn you that if you are turned off by soft porn or strong sexual content? This comes as close or even more than anything you will see on late night on Showtime or Cinemax. And may not be for you. Now that being said, I have not seen a series that is anywhere near as great as this epic 4 season series.

First, there are 4 seasons. The first season is called Spartacus: Blood and Sand. The actor who originally plays Spartacus is named Andy Whitfield and I am very sorry to say after this season he passed away from cancer. The link is [...] if you wish to see who he was. I do have to say it was a bit tough to take to his replacement later on as he was really loved. But it did not take long to fall in love with his character again even with a new actor by the name of Liam McIntyre who does an outstanding job playing Spartacus. After Blood and Sand was done they came up with a prequel called Spartacus: Gods of the Arena. This was 10 episodes long and it shows what events take place before Spartacus arrives and the circumstances in which he finds himself training to be a Gladiator. I will say this was not what he wanted, and the idea of Freedom is a theme that pounds away at you through the whole series due to his new surroundings. So in the Prequel Gods of the Arena, the Champion of the house is called Gannicus. For you ladies, I would suggest you google him....His real name is Dustin Clare and some feel he stole the show with his performance.

I can tell you events in each film but it will really ruin it for you. So after this prequel ""Gods of the Arena"", the next season is called Spartacus: Vengeance. Now this is where the original actor who played Spartacus was replaced. Again the actor who took this role is named Liam McIntyre and he does a brilliant job from start to the last episode and the conclusion of the series. The 4th and final season is called Spartacus: War of the Damned. Which is what I am suppose to be reviewing. In this last installment, they bring back many of the characters I have not mentioned that you will grow to love and root for which makes the last season War of the Damned brilliant and on your seat waiting for days to pass by so you can get to the next episode. In addition to the character Gannicus who plays in ""The Gods of the Arena"", the prequel, there is another character I should have mentioned sooner. The character's name is Crixus played by Manu Bennett. He is just as important and amazing as anyone in a lead acting role and in all great series or films, The Hero Spartacus also has to have a counter part to argue and fight with. You will enjoy this character Crixus and the evolution of his character through out his time in the series. In the final season ""The War of The Damned"", Spartacus faces his most intelligent and fierce opponent from the Roman Army, called Crassus played by Simon Merrells. Spartacus and Crassus att odds and destine to face each other, one fighting for glory of the Republic of Rome and the other Spartacus, the fight For freedom not just for Gladiator's, but for all woman, men, and humanity. The story just builds up until the last episode.

You can google ""Starz Spartacus Series"" and read about the characters and the story lines if you wish. I gave everyone the names of each series as they aired in order to clear up the confusion. So in telling you what it is all about and giving details and maybe hurting your experience, I will just say that I personally loved this series and it is one of my favorites I have ever seen. If you liked Braveheart, and Gladiator? This is a little like those great films but way more violent, and a ton more sexual content. Not good for children, or even teenagers depending on your flexibility with what age you allow your children to watch Rated R, to soft porn? This is in my humble opinion just for adults only. So just a friendly warning. So everyone asking for the 4th series? You have them all named in here. Spartacus : War of the Damned being the last season. It has everything you could think of or want. Themes of love, hate, Slaves, Freedom with the highest cost, bonds of brotherhood, the complexity of the time period, family dynamics and bonds between fathers and sons, Sacrifice and finally betrayal. It has everything you want in this type of genre of film. There are so many characters I did not mention or we would be here all day. I hope if you love these types of movies you will give this a chance. You will be taken in from the very first episode. They waste no time in any episode moving this along. I loved it and I continue to watch it over and over. Start with the first season Spartacus: Blood and Sand. You will not stop watching I promise you. Worth every dime. Hope this helped and cleared things up for everyone who were confused on how many seasons and why. Enjoy......",1378252800,2,5346,4.306852035749752

5556820,5,B00B52F278,"If you haven't already seen this amazing series... My God, what are you waiting for?!

Anyway, here's the part where I give my warning about spoilers and such. Okay, you've been warned :D

Premise: History will say that Spartacus is the story of a gladiator slave turned rebel leader. But for the sake of the series, I'll say it's the story of a free man, a warrior, turned into a gladiator who said he isn't going to take this s*** any longer and became a rebel leader, then legendary hero.

When this series first debuted several years ago, I was a bit skeptic. The special effects didn't impress me from the trailers I'd seen, but still, I was going to give it a chance. After I watched the pilot, I was hooked! Addicted! Strung-out during season breaks and having all kinds of withdrawal symptoms until its return.  This has got to be one of the greatest television shows ever written, acted, directed... created. There is something for everyone in this series. Do you love romance? Yeah, it has it. Tragic at times and even morbid, but romance is often blooming. If you love sex scenes, then you get that by the buckets. But if intrigue, action, blood, guts and battles are your cup of tea, then sit down for a full serving because this particular show glorifies in violence unlike any other.

If you don't know me by now, that's JUST my thing. I love when a show has everything I could ever hope for. The plot lines were always unpredictable, even when you knew the history of some of the characters, and that's not an easy feat on the part of the writers/creators. Each episode was action-packed and loaded with devilish schemes sure to keep any viewer thoroughly entertained.

Special Note: The main actor who portrayed Spartacus originally fell ill before they could continue onto the second season, so they created a prequel to give him time to heal. Unfortunately, Andy Whitfield passed away from cancer. Broke many fans hearts including Yours Truly. I do have to take my hat off to the creators for coming up with a fantastic prequel that gave us the amazing gladiator, Gannicus. Also, they found  another wonderful actor to take up the torch and continue to blaze Spartacus' trail.

The final season wrapped up early this year, so now you can watch back-to-back episodes at your leisure and immerse yourself in this barbaric world of ancient Rome to your heart's content.

5556822,5,B00B52F278,"I LOVE THIS SHOW!!

Since the end of Rome on HBO, this has been a bright spot. Not as good quality-wise, but it doesn't try to be. It's a moving comic book at times, and I mean that in a good way!

I'm partial to the first season myself. Wish we'd have seen this same story play out with the original actor. RIP Andy.

The new guy isn't bad. Just too American-looking. Andy W was more exotic-looking. But all in all, the new Spartacus is ok in my book!

Couldn't wait to see this all come to an end this last season, and now I'm said it's gone. Reminds me of when the final Star Wars came out, where Annikin turned into Darth Vader. I knew all the stuff that had to happen by the end of the film story-wise, but couldn't wait to see how they did it.

I miss Batiatus terribly. IMO Batiatus was THE BEST character on the show by far and was lost way too soon, although what choice did they have? Ashur was a great villain. Loved hating him. Season 1 Crixus was a thing of deadly beauty with an impeccable badass character. His stare was like a laser. Missed that guy for the rest of the series. Loved Agron. They should've kept his brother Duro, especially if the original Naevia was gonna leave. Never got into the new actress. Agron's boyfriend angle was a surprise, but it worked, too. Gannicus was just THE MAN. Could've been a Spartacus, if he cared enough. After Batiatus, none of the bad guys compared until Crassus & Caesar.

Crassus was an excellently casted and acted character in the final season. Superb master villain performance. His kid was suitably hatable.  Julius Caesar is one of my all time heroes, so his portrayal at first concerned me, but I loved him quickly. Then THE scene with him and Little Crassus. HOW DISTURBING WAS THAT? And why to Caesar? To refer to the stupid rumors about that him his enemies constantly threw around, that he'd given up his...um, virginity, let's say...to a king for ships and support as a young man. Caesar's enemies loved that rumor cuz it made them feel better about Caesar doing their wives.

5556824,5,B00B52F278,"Spartacus is one of the best series of all time. I have watched the entire series at least a dozen times on on-demand, and still can't wait to own the whole set! While much has been said about the slaves and the their Roman foes, I would say that the conflict between Ilthiya and Lucretia is one the most compelling aspect of the first two seasons. These two women are truly evil & deadly without ever touching a weapon. Watching these two plot and scheme against each other, and everyone else, was half the show. I loved ""War of the Damned"", but their presence was definitely missed. How neither Viva or Lucy were nominated for emmys is outrageous. And no one, absolutely no one, can curse and rage in Roman like John Hannah. Who needs Shakespeare when you have Batiatus! The prequel was genius to bring Batiatus & Lucretia back.
And take it easy on Liam, the man got his dream job in the worst way. He had to replace the unreplacable Andy Whitfield, and no matter what he did people were going to have a problem with it.

5556827,3,B00B52F278,"Spartacus has been somewhat of a tumultuous ride throughout the show's history.  It began on the wrong foot, showing off generic action against bad special effects while characters spoke cheese.  A certain John Hannah carried us through the show until it hit its stride and there became one of the best shows on television for a season and a half until we faced the inevitable: Andy Whitfield was dead and not coming back, as was the character Hannah played.  Suddenly the show relied on a new actor in the role of the show's namesake to take up arms against a villain in Glaber that proved incompetent at the best of times.  They tried, bless their hearts, but the show struggled and lost direction.  Roman soldiers suffered Storm Trooper syndrome, being proven so weak compared to the escaped gladiators that any ten were not worth even a single of the weakest gladiators while Spartacus' character devolved into slow motion screaming and bouts of random speech-giving while intricately-planned battles between equal opponents and character development were put on the backburner.

So here we come to Spartacus: War of the Damned, the final season of this epic ride, and almost immediately it became the tale of two shows; the good and the bad.  The good is the villains of the piece.  Crassus is easily Spartacus' most formidable foe yet, and gives a nuanced portrayal that at times can make you love or hate the character in a similar fashion to Hannah's Batiatus.  Much the same with Caesar, whose young arrogance is quickly proven to be well-deserved in a surprising way.  Meanwhile Crassus' son Tiberius provides someone the audience can properly despise.  This is a good set of villains most stories would beg to have as characters who can drive the plot forward and give the heroes of the story something realistically formidable to face off against.  So what's the problem?

The problem is the rebellion side of the show.  The former slaves.  The problem begins immediately from the very first scene.  See, it's been months since Vengeance left off.  Spartacus' army has grown to the tens of thousands, if not more, and they trounce around Roman territory defeating big Roman armies.  What's the problem with this, you might ask?  Vengeance, you see, was very favorable toward our protagonists.  All the goals they had set upon joining the rebellion or escaping into freedom were met.  Spartacus got his revenge, Crixus got Naevia back, Gannicus redeemed himself to Oenomaus and everyone else, the couple HUNDRED or so who followed Spartacus, was safely free as they had wanted.  So why are they now an enormous army randomly smashing occasional Roman armies?  What is their new goal, or motivation?  This is never once answered until only a couple episodes are left and then they only name those goals to tell use that they've changed.  Just as bad, the characters are more like caricatures, a bunch of people just going through the motions of what the audience expects while occasionally given a slow motion jumping/screaming sequence.  It's bloody, it's violent, it's sexy, it's boring.  Midway through the season they decide to focus an episode on the Roman camp and it wasn't until midway through that I realized most the rebels had received all of three of the fifty minutes given the episode, and that I did not miss them at all.

Such is how it goes for most of the season, as the Romans carry the show while rebels go through the motions and we're left cheering on classic Spartacus and his stubborn invincibility, or classic Gannicus and his drunken partying, or classic Crixus and his passion, without much real development happening.  This begins changing in the final few episodes, where they begin focus on furthering the development of certain individuals, but it is too often abridged (as in the case of Crixus, who is given months of glorious battle as he strikes out on his own...told in the space of under ten minutes) or worse (as in the case of Gannicus and Sibyl) it is completely forced.  All the while we struggle figuring out what these characters actually WANT, what they desire the end result to be.  On the flipside, the Roman camp becomes a mess of tangled plotlines, largely thanks to Crassus' personal slave Kore whose storyline slips into far too many others, pulling them together and going a whole lot of nowhere.  By the end I'd call the episodes some of the worse in the series since the original pilot but for a fantastic finale which tied everything together in almost the best it possibly could given everything which came before.

What then to make of Spartacus: War of the Damned?  It is certainly enjoyable.  If you loved the characters before then you'll more than likely keep loving them and want to see them to the bitter end.  It has plenty of enjoyable action and sex scenes to grab your attention.  The Romans are a pure joy to watch and I would not mind at all tuning into a spinoff series focused around Caesar, Crassus and the like.  BUT, the season suffers from a lot of major storytelling issues and is poorly focused upon developing too many new characters and plots and is not the season-long sendoff one might hope it would be.",1370131200,17,5193,4.806306306306307
5556828,5,B00B52F278,"I don't have Starz and I saw this advertisement at the movie theatre and I fell in love with it right away, if you like bloody, gory, sex and nudity (this series has it all). I couldn't wait to get my hands on this and watch it.

Back then they didn't wear the clothes like we wear today. Its a simple dress code than we see today. The only sport that they had were limited. The games were their entertainment at that time and they were bloody, it was a fight to the death and the people loved this. The more bloody, the better. The people liked what they saw.

The language is somewhat different than how we speak it today but just how they say it and the expressions are the different part of their society. The dialogue is the same its just how they say it. There are a little difference between the Roman gods and the Greek gods though. I am use to the Greek gods but not the Roman gods. All in all I loved this series.

I wish that they can make more movies and TV shows like this. The more fights, the more bloody and gory is what I say.",1369958400,4,1043,4.053398058252427
5556829,5,B00B52F278,"In my humble opinion there are very few TV shows that You feel compelled to watch over and over again. This is one of those rare shows. As I stated in my title I feel this show will be remembered forever. Not for the CGI nudity and violence, but rather how well the writers told this story. The CGI, nudity and violence were necessary tools to tell the story. The fact that these tools were ubiquitous does not subtract from the show. The nudity was artistic and the violence was authentic.  I would also like to say that most fans rarely talk at length about the nudity and violence, they talk about the story and acting. Many thought the show was doomed with the death of Andy me included. I've never been so thrilled to be wrong in my entire life. Liam's performance  under the circumstances will be the stuff of legend. Andy and Liam are both Spartacus.  Manu will always be Crixus.  I was in the military, a USAF pararescueman. That being said I really enjoyed watching characters that were helpless slaves evolve into warriors taking their destiny in their own hands. They were given nothing and earned everything they had. Every minute they lived free was a minute they had to fight for and was true blessing. Friendship and honor meant something back then. When You gave your ""word"" you kept it. These things are missing in today's society and we are not better for it. Freedom is taken for granted. Being in special operations I had to earn everything and evolve into warrior. To see this process on TV was an amazing and rewarding experience. I will buy this whole series and watch it over and over. When my kids are old enough I will let them watch it. This series is something You experience rather than watch.

5556831,4,B00B52F278,"If you liked the series from the beginning, then you will like War of the Damned.

People like this series because of the violence, gore and the graphic sex performed by beautiful babes.  Every woman in this series is hot and just makes me drool.

Even the new Naevia grew on me this season.  I still prefer the first actress.  She was much more hotter.  I don't think that the old Naevia would have worked in War of the Damned.  She looked too soft and cute for that role.

I take off one star for only one reason.  Every single time an important character got killed in battle, it was always done in slo-motion, especially, the last three episodes.  I thought that could have used a change of pace.  When the slo-mo started in battle, you knew what was going to happen.  He or she is gone.

I have to hand it to the writers of this extraordinary series.  People obviously know enough about history to know how this was going to end.  The writers did a great job keeping me glued to this series over the years.",1368230400,3,1011,4.303191489361702

I did not even have the energy to explain the story to the reviewer who wrote the 1 star comments.  Thank goodness, D. Meyer made an eloquent post at the end of her comments that you MUST read!!!!!!!!!  I myself, replied to that post because it said everything I wanted to say.  The series, including the final season and the finale, all rate 5 STARS in my book!!!!!!  Obviously, this epic series is so great that now it has spawned a deluge of other historical type miniseries.  Notice now, we have Vikings, DaVinci's Demons, etc...  Spartacus made all of us realize that history can be made to not only inform us but to entertain as well.  Every single thing presented in the series was not necessarily ""historically correct"", nor did it need to be.  The basics were all there and the acting, writing, directing, special effects, etc... were SUPERB!!!!!!  I had never seen a miniseries that I thought matched the scope of ROME which was shown on HBO a few years ago until Spartacus blew in back in 2009!!!!!  This landmark series will stand on its own merit for years to come.  Anyone who had anything to do with its production should be proud of such a magnanimous achievement.

5556838,5,B00B52F278,"First, for those that may not have ever seen Spartacus on Starz and are looking to get into the series via DVD or Instant Video based on its popularity, Spartacus: War of the Damned is season 3 of the show but technically the fourth season. After the excellent 2010 5-star season premier under the title Spartacus: Blood and Sand, Andy Whitfield who played the lead role of Spartacus tragically died of cancer. Whitfield embodied Spartacus; he was a believable, imposing, rough, tough character that made viewers feel like they were watching the real guy from circa 70 BC. His untimely illness left the studio scrambling to decide how to or if the series would continue. Ultimately the studio decided to produce a prequel that ideally would give Whitfield time to recover after treatment, but sadly Whitfield relapsed and passed shortly after production of the prequel.

The prequel was called Gods of the Arena and it was excellent. But there was something missing from Gods that made Blood & Sand the 5-Star series that it was: Andy Whitfield and his Spartacus character. Then in Vengeance we got Spartacus back, but was Whitfield really replaceable? Starz took a chance and went for the Whitfield look-alike with Liam McIntyre versus finding another imposing force that could also act. Yes, McIntyre does look quite a bit like Whitfield, but there was something just a little less imposing, less rough and less tough about the guy; in Vengeance, McIntyre was a kinder, warmer Spartacus that smiled too much. But in War of the Damned something changed...dramatically...McIntyre stopped smiling and started kicking and carving you-know-what. And ultimately, War of the Damned rivaled the first season...which is saying a lot!

Indeed...War of the Damned is one of the best series finales that I have ever sat through. McIntyre really captured the essence of what Whitfield started in season one: Spartacus as a down but not beaten man thrown into slavery determined to be free and stop at nothing to do so. The supporting cast deserves high honors as well; returning characters put their hearts' and souls' into every episode--especially Manu Bennett as Crixus. And new cast members had some tough shoes to fill after some amazing performances by the likes of John Hannah, Lucy Lawless and several others in seasons past. But the new characters filled their parts with passion and believability...especially those in the parts of Crassus, his son Tiberius, and Julius Gaius Caesar.

As for the show itself, similar to its series predecessors, Spartacus War of the Damned leaves nothing for the imagination during its time period: love, battle, adultery, orgy, torture, rape, murder...it's all there in all its glory...and I mean ALL its glory. The events of Spartacus War of the Damned take place after Spartacus' gang of gladiators escape slavery and form a large rebellion to strike down Roman slavery, and if you know the true story of Spartacus then you know that this series finally will leave fans as disappointed in Spartacus' end as they are satisfied with the absolute best series to have ever aired on the Starz network.

Keep the credits rolling after the final episode to see the tribute to Andy Whitfield in the Arena shouting: ""I am SPARTACUS!""

Gods of the Arena: 4 stars
Vengeance: 3 stars
War of the Damned: 5 stars",1366329600,74,3357,4.9875

They gave plenty of warnings. This is an epic bitter struggle for one man that ended up with him the leader of thousands. The last season and finale will not disappoint. I loved Andy Whitfield in the role as Spartacus, but I must admit that I have grown to love Liam McIntyre's portrayal of Spartacus. For me, he is Spartacus and gave an award winning performance this season. The cast does not let us down.

5556843,5,B00B52F278,"Along with the Walking Dead, this was my favorite series. As much as I loved Andy Whitfield (God bless him and his family), I must say Liam McIntyre was equally outstanding and perhaps even more. It is a bit like comparing your favorite James Bond -- Sean Connery or Roger Moore. All are outstanding and render their own interpretations. I am a PhD in European Military History and approve of this series in the way that they rendered history. We all could have small quibbles about this and that, that the Romans always threw pila (special spears) before closing, that Onamaeus was really a Gaul, not a black man...but what a character he was anyway. The cause of liberty should embrace all human kind and the scriptwriters were courageous and inclusive in making this point. Crixus and Gannicus did exist, the former as a Gaul and the latter as a Celt. Since nothing more is known about them, the scriptwriters were open to their interpretations. Of the three primary accounts about Spartacus, two say he died on the battlefield, and one says the body was never found. This series took the latter interpretation and thereby provided a beautiful ending. The final season seemed a bit compressed compared to the season right before it, but the producers had decided to wind the series down. Another two seasons clearly could have been done. I personally found the acting, the characters (without exception) and the scriptwriters to be outstanding. Some reviewers have commented about the gay characters and scenes. I am a definitely ""straight"" Independent Conservative and did not like the first series scenes between Barca and Pietro mostly because I did not like them as men. Agron and Nasir were different because I liked them as men. As an ex-military officer, I would have been proud to stand beside them in battle and share their table. Agron's farewell to Spartacus was particularly moving and apt. The final episode was sensationally moving. I am proud to say that it moved me to tears several times and caused me to scream into the picture and pray to God to be able to help them. Who among us does not understand that there is good and evil and that the cause of brotherhood and liberty are worth dying for?",1365897600,112,2217,4.776041666666667
5556844,1,B00B52F278,"Spartacus is a tale of two shows. Blood and Sand and Gods of the Arena were masterpieces. Both seasons were amazing dramas with excellent action scenes, writing, characterization and acting. If Blood and Sand ended with that one season, it would have been enough for many fans. Sadly, Vengeance turned out to be an utter disaster. You can see my other review for that. I watched the first episode of War of the Damned to see if the season was worth watching. I believe Spartacus, Naevia and company ambushed some Romans in that episode. Ludicrous. Spartacus, Crixus and the others were commanders of the slave armies. They would not personally carry out ambushes like that. This nonsense and the reliance on unnecessary violence to substitute for proper storytelling destroyed the show for me. I had believed the show would accurately depict Spartacus's transition from slave warrior to commander of the slave armies. These men became rich from looting Italy. Yet, they were enemies of the Roman Republic, which eventually was their doom. The show never transitioned these characters. Their mentality remained the same as it was from Blood and Sand. For the lowbrow crowd that is ignorant of history, perhaps this is fine. But for anyone else, it's unacceptable. The show became trash. Is it any surprise that Starz gave up on it?

One more thing, whose bright idea was it to make a violent male oriented action TV show combined with overbearing homosexual overtones? I have nothing against homosexuality, but Agron and Nasir's relationship went ridiculously overboard. It's really not surprising why the show got cancelled.

The funny thing was, the homosexual relationship in Blood and Sand was much better depicted than in War of the Damned. Which really just shows how terrible the writing did get on Spartacus in the end.",1365811200,16,1826,5.023102310231023
5556845,5,B00B52F278,"So I reviewed season one and the prequel Gods of the Arena, and gave them both five stars. So let me skip to season three, and say as a dedicated fan from the very first episode, it's still a great show. Um, and it's still gay porn. Yeah, OK, there's naked women, too, (like one for every three naked men,) but that's not why I watch this show. No...not for the nude men, either, (I heard you thinking that you pervert!) Just kidding. You're not a pervert if you watch any of these shows. Like I said in my first review of season one, despite the porn, (the GAY porn,) it's still one hell of a great show.

I'm a lover of anything Roman Empire. I'm not a youngster anymore, and I don't get thrills from seeing nude women. (Never was thrilled about nude men.) But the cast and the production and the writing and the everything over the top works for this show. Yes, even the porn. Or is it porn? Hey, I don't look too carefully, it's like I don't hit pause and study the naked actors or actresses, I mean, but I'd swear those are fake bushes on those nude women. I mean in season three, especially. It sure looks like those are female pubic hair toupees, if you will. And I've read several comments that the male members are prosthetics, too. But that's not the point. I don't care about any of that.

What I do care about is a punk teenager, (son of Crassus,) raping Julius Caesar. I mean, come on. Yeah, I know the producers are taking liberties, and even though Caesar had no historical participation in the Spartacus wars, they thought it would be a good idea to include him. But as this punk's biatch? Now, you're talking perverted. But you know what? According to the writings of Gaius Marius, any type of homosexuality in the legions was a capital crime. So that's taking their ""liberties"" a little too far. But they're taking everything too far. And like I said many times, and in many different ways, it works for this show. Spartacus will be missed. At least I'll miss it. Until the next Roman historical show comes on. Maybe that show about Leonardo will be good. I'll be watching it. Fingers crossed!",1365552000,3,2111,4.410256410256411
