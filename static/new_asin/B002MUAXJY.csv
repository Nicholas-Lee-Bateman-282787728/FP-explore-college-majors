3952626,1,B002MUAXJY,"Note:  This review concerns only ""The Mirror Crack'd"" (so far!!

Why on earth did Masterpiece bother showing this remake when it was done superlatively well in the Joan Hickson/Miss Marple series (1992), with Claire Bloom as the American actress Marina Gregg&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marple-The-Classic-Mysteries-Collection-Caribbean-Mystery-4-50-from-Paddington-Moving-Finger-Nemesis-At-Bertram-s-Hotel-Murder-at-Vicarage-Sleeping-Murder-They-Do-It-with-Mirrors-Mirror-Crack-d-from-Side-to-Side/dp/B000CRR36K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marple: The Classic Mysteries Collection (Caribbean Mystery / 4:50 from Paddington / Moving Finger / Nemesis / At Bertram's Hotel / Murder at Vicarage / Sleeping Murder / They Do It with Mirrors / Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side)</a>?  It would have been MUCH nicer to see that again!  This version is just plain awful, perversely cast, and just plain boring.  This is one of my favorite Agatha Christie novels, and I turned it off after half an hour.

Watch the Joan Hickson version, or the movie with Angela Lansbury as Miss Marple and Elizabeth Taylor as Marina Gregg (1980)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agatha-Christie-s-Mystery-Collection-Death-on-the-Nile-Evil-Under-the-Sun-The-Mirror-Crack-d/dp/B001KP2J44/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agatha Christie's Mystery Collection: Death on the Nile/Evil Under the Sun/The Mirror Crack'd</a>.

3952627,1,B002MUAXJY,Was very pleased when this new Marple was announced on PBS.  What a disappointment. Script was bad; casting perhaps even worse. Reminds me of a high school drama production; a large cast of actors together on stage but no one seems to be aware of anyone else on the stage.  Everything over done except Marple herself who had few lines and not very good ones at that.  Watch any of the previous ones; they beat this in every way.  What a disappointment.,1274659200,17,452,4.475609756097561
3952628,1,B002MUAXJY,"This new PBS production is an all time television low. The actress playing Marina Gregg is fine when she is playing a dried up dutchess, but as a once beautiful Hollywood movie star, she is simply awful. She is the least convincing  American I have seen from a British production company in a very long time. The pitiful script throws Americanisms around like comfetti. Generally they are used incorrectly. Marina says ""pull up a chair"" to the detectives , instead of the appropriate Americanism, ""have a seat.""
Is there a reason that they could not hire an American actress? Jamie Lee Curtis would have been perfect and, I'll bet, available. She would have had the natural accent and she would have understood Americanisms.
My suggestion is to watch the one that was produced in the 1980's. It starred Elizabeth Taylor as Marina Gregg and was vastly superior.
Better luck next time to the production team. I hope that this was just a fluke. I hope the rest of the new Christie mysteries are up to the old standard.",1274659200,16,1015,4.702247191011236

3952646,3,B002MUAXJY,"Julia McKenzie makes a very comfortable Miss Marple.  The series attracts good casts.  The settings ""feel"" right.  ""The Blue Geranium,"" however, is a short story (from ""The Tuesday Club Murders""); and stretching doesn't improve it.  In some of the other episodes (""The Pale Horse"" and ""The Secret of Chimneys"") Miss Marple feels intrusive--as if the screenwriters tried to squeeze her into stories belonging to other characters.  Even an average Christie story is better than most of what's on television these days, but this series won't blot out memories of past versions of Dame Agatha's spinster.",1484524800,7,600,5.273684210526316

3952667,4,B002MUAXJY,"Some of the episodes are outstanding and some require a suspension of disbelief as to the coincidences, etc.. I watched the earlier seasons with Geraldine McEwan as Miss Marple. She was quite good, so I was apprehensive about watching the new season with Julia McKenzie. Not to worry, McKenzie is a very good Miss Marple, too. She is just a different Ms. M. Her manner is slightly brisker and perhaps more direct.",1479168000,,413,4.75
3952668,5,B002MUAXJY,"I liked this season very much. I especially liked ""The Mirror Cracked From Side To Side"" and ""The Pale Horse"" Excellent acting, costume and scenery. It really makes you feel like you're in England in the 1950's. The episodes feel more like movies than tv productions. Hope there will be new seasons of Agatha Christie's Marple to come, with Julia McKenzie, not sure though as I think I read somewhere that the BBC bought the rights to it.

Quite a disappointment!

Furthermore, Miss Marple was written as a ""fluffy, dithery elderly lady, born and reared in Victorian/Edwardian Times"" who often behaves in a confused and flustered manner.... nothing like this firm, no-nonsense, brusk woman.  Sheesh.  Not as bad as some Miss Marples' (one movie I saw had her participating in a Fox Hunt, hallowing like anything on horseback!), but just not the ""highly unlikely brilliant detective"" of Miss Christie's imagination.",1437264000,,721,5.2894736842105265

3952765,4,B002MUAXJY,"This series improves on the classic Christie mysteries with innovative plot adaptations and on occasion new characters.  I enjoy both Geraldine McEwan (season 1-3 played with an inquisitive, bright-eyed, sly wisdom) and Julia McKenzie (season 4-6 played with slightly weary, worried attitude of the transparent old lady who's wisdom is overlooked and underestimated) as the charmingly nosy Miss Marple, though each lady brings something unique to the role.  The acting is top notch and I love seeing some of the best in English actors appear in roles large and small.  The cinematography is beautiful as are the wardrobe and location choices.  I buy/rent in HD when I can to better enjoy the color and texture of wardrobe, gardens, uniquely English interiors and locations (sometimes only SD is available).  Kudos to the art director and set designer.  If you want the original story, read the book, but if you want an adaptation better suited to today's audience, this is it.  Since I am primarily familiar with the Miss Marple Christie mysteries, I especially enjoyed the many episodes where Miss Marple was cleverly added to an Agatha Christie mystery that didn't originally include her.  It was like discovering a new Miss Marple mystery!!  For the most part, the pacing is perfectly relaxed like a lovely English summer day, punctuated by the crisp enunciation of tripping tongues delivering the clever dialogue.  That said, some episodes drag a little slow in spots, like Caribbean Mystery in this Season 5 set, but not enough for me to grow impatient or think of turning it off because I know it will pick up soon enough.  From all seasons these were my favorites:  A Murder is Announced (S1), The Moving Finger (S2), by the Pricking of My Thumbs (a Tommy & Tuppence mystery with Miss Marple inserted as Tuppence's cohort- Brilliant) (S2), Nemesis (S3), Pocket Full of Rye (S4) and Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side (S5).",1430611200,,1927,4.9875

3952808,4,B002MUAXJY,"As light entertainment goes, Agatha Christies works are pretty difficult to screw up. Her mysteries are fun and generally quite solvable by the armchair sleuth, not too taxing but interesting enough to keep the viewer roped in, watching for the next clue. Even a mediocre production of her works is enjoyable. These ITV productions exceed most others in quality. The production values are superb, and the river of talent they draw from runs very deep. Any way you look at it, this is a great way to spend a relaxing evening.

When it comes to Miss Marple, there are generally two different approaches taken by actresses, and both are legitimately based on Agatha Christie. The characterization of Marple evolves somewhat throughout the run of Christies books. The earlier Marple is very Victorian  prim, proper, pinched, and sometimes a little grating on the nerves for the audience as well as for the policemen who consistently look silly when she is around. The other is a more modern woman  clever but kind, cunning and plotting but never condescending. She is independent, matronly rather than spinsterly, and a great deal of fun  everybodys favourite unmarried auntie. Julia McKenzie takes the latter approach, and the result is delightful. I loved her in this role.

The mysteries are great fun  Delightfully deceptive glitz and glamour of Hollywood (with a splash of Gene Tierney) in The Mirror Crackd from Side to Side; diamonds and hidden passageways in The Secret of Chimneys; deceit and greed in The Blue Geranium; and devilish witches and sorcery in The Pale Horse.

The bonus program Agatha Christies Garden peers behind the shrubbery of the infamously secretive scribes personal retreat. Pam Ferris (Rosemary & Thyme) is a stellar host for this sparky little biography. Its unfortunate that the sound recording is rather lacking, but you lose track of that due to Ms. Ferris talent. (You can see Pam talking as she ambles through Christies ample gardens but what you hear is the hollow, muffled sound of sub-standard studio recording. She does an amazing job matching her ADR with the visual, though.)

The inclusion of an alternate, non-Marple version of The Pale Horse is a brilliant addition to AGATHA CHRISTIES MARPLE COMPLETE SERIES 5 IN BLU-RAY. Its a fascinating glimpse into the world of literary interpretation, with two such divergent films springing from the same source. Watching the two back-to-back is great fun. Acorn previously release Series 1  3 starring Geraldine McEwan as Miss Marple, and Series 4  5 starring Julia McKenzie in the role on DVD. The first three episodes of Series 5 aired in summer 2010, and were previously released as a separate set comprising these episodes plus a myriad of bonus programming. Since the Pale Horse has had its US broadcast, Acorn is now able to re-release Series 5 blu-ray with the addition of this delightful tale (in both its versions).

This is an excellent box set with fun content. Well worth it.",1397433600,,2972,5.008113590263692
3952809,5,B002MUAXJY,"I had never seen an Agatha Christie movie before these Miss Marples.

I have series 1-5 and I was a bit apprehensive when they changed the actress from Geraldine McEwan to Julia McKenzie.  Each portrayal of Miss Marple is very different from the other; I think I just might like Juila a bit more than Geraldine--Julia is more intense!  The Miss Marple movies keep you occupied with all the different characters--you've got to keep tuned in otherwise you will be backing the DVD up to see who is who and what just happened!

McKenzie's portrayal is not as eccentric as McEwan's and for that reason, more believable. I still regard Joan Hickson's portrayal from the BBC's series (in the late 80's and early 90's) as the definitive screen Marple, but Julia McKenzie does a good job. As with the first four seasons, these episodes are gorgeous to look at and there's plenty of decent acting offered by familiar (and even famous) faces from the world of British TV, film, and theater.

The production values are still top notch, the acting is excellent, but the adaptations are still loose to say the least.  Julia McKenzie makes a passable Miss Marple.  There are two versions of The Pale Horse, one with her, one without.  My favorite of the bunch is The Secret of Chimneys.  My least favorite is The Blue Geranium.  And they managed to make the oft-filmed The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side fresh and fun, thanks to a truly daffy performance by Joanna Lumley (""She always did have that ripe look.  Like a piece of fruit about to go off."").

This series strays from the original story lines giving Christie fans a jolt since they will see Tommmy and Tuppence along side Miss Marple and the character you KNOW did it will end up innocent after all!

The Marple are not as letter faithful to Agatha Christies stories as the Joan Hixon series, however they are still great fun to watch.  The scenery and costuming are breathtaking.  And if you are a Marple addict like I am, it is fun to watch the different versions of the same title back to back either on Amazon or Netflix, just to see the differences in the productions.  US television is not the greatest these days, so thank heavens for the availability of the British!",1374019200,,774,4.696296296296296

3952834,3,B002MUAXJY,"Throughout the years, I have watched the many actresses that played Miss Marple and the one I think really put a stamp on the role was Joan Hickson. She nailed the real Marple the best, with Geraldine McEwan a close second.  Julie McKenzie was alright but somehow didn't come across as Agatha's Miss Marple. There was something lacking in her portrayal that just didn't make the mold. I am sure she is a great actress but this is not one of her best roles. I would not recommend this as it was a disappoint and I won't purchase anymore Maple with Julie in it. It this is the first MIss Marple that you watch it would be okay but not great.  Julie doesn't come across as the nagging, gossipy old lady that Agatha Christie envisioned.",1372204800,3,732,4.4148148148148145

3952844,5,B002MUAXJY,"I'm starting in reverse with this series, buying the AGATHA CHRISTIE'S MARPLE SEASON 5 BLU-RAY first. I've seen some of the series that starred Joan Hickson&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miss-Marple-3-Feature-Length-Mysteries-The-Body-in-the-Library-A-Murder-Is-Announced-A-Pocketful-of-Rye/dp/B000068UE9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miss Marple - 3 Feature Length Mysteries (The Body in the Library / A Murder Is Announced / A Pocketful of Rye)</a>, which I enjoyed, and so I figured I give the newer series a try.

The reason I started with Season 5 is because I read that Joanna Lumley (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Absolutely-Fabulous-Complete-Series-1/dp/B0009WFFB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Absolutely Fabulous: Complete Series 1</a>) was in one of the episodes and I adore her, so I figured I'd start here. Also, Seasons 1-4 are not available on Blu-Ray. And there was an actress change from Geraldine McEwan to Julia McKenzie in the role of Miss Jane Marple, but I don't know why.

Anyway, I enjoyed watching Season 5 and since I really haven't read any of the books, except for ""The Blue Geranium,"" which I thought was from Sherlock Holmes -- I read it in high school -- and it was another reason I started with this season, I can't really say whether or not substantial changes have been made to characters or story-lines.

I can say that each episode, they're actually like feature length movies, are fun, riveting, and the scenery is exquisite. The cinematography is fantastic and each mystery will have you guessing up until the last minute.

Julia McKenzie does a great job in the role of ""Miss Jane Marple,"" as she's a little more sprightlier than Joan Hickson (whom many believe to be the definitive ""Marple""), and has slightly more elegance than the disheveled (but endearing) portrayal by Geraldine McEwan. Joanna Lumley is fabulous as ""Dolly Bantry"" and she's also featured in Season 1 (I just got the Season 1-3 McEwan MARPLE on DVD) as the same character.

I'm not sure why but the DVD version of MARPLE SERIES (SEASON) 5 doesn't include ""The Pale Horse."" I almost bought it accidentally when I was ordering the previous seasons since it's available as a separate DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agatha-Christie-s-Marple-The-Pale-Horse/dp/B004VLYHNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agatha Christie's Marple: The Pale Horse</a>, but luckily I checked because the MARPLE SERIES 5 BLU-RAY includes The Pale Horse!

Here's the specials on the Blu-Rays:

***  SPECIAL FEATURES  ***

***  THE MIRROR CRACK'D FROM SIDE TO SIDE  ***
""Agatha Christie's Garden"" - 01-hour:09-seconds
This hour long featurette hosted by Pam Ferris shows the wonderful garden that was Christie's sanctuary.

""Greenway Garden"" - 03-minutes:06-seconds
The history of the Greenway Garden, which is on the property that Christie and her husband lived on the ""Greenway Estate.""

***  THE PALE HORSE  (this has the new version with McKenzie too)***
""The Pale Horse"" - 1996 Version - 01-hour:41-minutes:27-seconds
This earlier adaptation has a different plot twist and Miss Marple isn't the crime solver (in fact, she's not in it at all). In this version, a friend of one of the victims, a suspect, and a budding investigator/police aide come together to solve the crime. I'm not sure why this was not included on the DVD set, but it is here on the Blu-Ray.

Picture and sound quality is outstanding. If you enjoy mysteries than I would definitely recommend MARPLE SERIES (SEASON) 5 BLURAY, since you get ""The Pale Horse"" movie as well.",1360022400,6,3883,5.756993006993007

3952856,4,B002MUAXJY,"I do love the Miss Marple series and I'm glad that they've continued it.  However, I am of the opinion that Geraldine McEwan was the best actress thus far (although all are very talented).  Some of the details have been altered in order to appeal more to today's viewers and most changes have been done very well indeed.
My greatest disappointment with this season was the choices of stories.  I am very aware that there were only so many Miss Marple stories published and I do applaud the decision to use some of the short stories.  I just don't believe they are as strong as they could be.  Personally, I would have enjoyed seeing a whole collection (The Tuesday Club Murders) used as the background for an entire season.",1346889600,,723,4.573643410852713
3952857,5,B002MUAXJY,"As always, Amazon Instant Video is wonderfully clear and fast-streaming.  We use the PC & Roku for Amazon's services... and I'm never disappointed.  Regarding Marple Season 5, the episodes were really great.  This series is my favorite of all the productions of Miss Marple stories... even above the Joan Hickson classics from the 1980's.  The best of British actors seem to pop up in every episode, and the production captures the early 1950's in such a beautiful way.  The Pale Horse is the best I think of the 4 episodes in this group.  It has some great twisting & turning.  The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side has always been one of my favorite stories, and this version didn't disappoint me at all.  Lindsay Duncan does justice to the part of Marina Gregg, and Joanna Lumley is great in anything she does.  For those of you that want episodes that adhere strictly to the original stories, this series may not be for you.  Some liberty has been taken here and there with characters and some plotlines.  I'm not bothered by this so I found them to be wonderful adaptations.",1344556800,3,1078,4.650793650793651
3952858,3,B002MUAXJY,"As a big fan of Agatha Christie, it saddens me how much these series take liberties in adapting the novels.  I just read this book.  Miss Marple isn't even in it.  The story has been so watered down.  It's really a shame, because I would hate for someone to see this movie and then think they know the story ""Secret of Chimneys"" by Agatha Christie.  The novel is far richer, the characters are wonderful, the writing superb, the storyline far deeper.  This is a good enterntaing film, well made, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it, but don't think for a minute that it's an accurate rendition of the ""Secret of Chimneys"".  It's barely a shadow of it.",1325980800,2,644,4.452991452991453

3952861,4,B002MUAXJY,"Production values on the ""Miss Marple"" mysteries get better with each succeeding series.  While this reviewer still prefers Geraldine McEwen in the title role, the plots here, character development, guest star cameos, scenery and editing are extremely well done.  Unlike David Suchet's definitive Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple has had nearly half a dozen players, so you have to decide for yourself which one over the decades ""has it"" for you.  Only disappointment was with the extra DVD on Agatha Christie's home as it moved at a fairly slow pace and did not give enough of a definitive locale (assuming England, of course) though Christiephiles will likely find it entertaining.",1317254400,2,678,5.201834862385321
3952862,5,B002MUAXJY,"Over the years, I have read all of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple mysteries and watched all of the modern film iterations of Miss Marple, played by everyone from the marvelous Joan Hickson to the latest grand dame, Julia McKenzie.  Not surprisingly, my enjoyment of the series varied somewhat as each actress brought a different interpretation to the lead character and each production had its own atmosphere and style.  The quality of the acting has never faltered, however, and many of Britain's finest actors have appeared in these mysteries.  Series 5 with Julia McKenzie is a special delight.  I was surprised at how lavish and rich the production quality is, how perfect the period details are -- especially in ""The Mirror Crack'd."" Joanna Lumley figured prominently in this episode and she is picture-perfect as Miss Marple's slightly ditsy and delightfully nosy friend, Dolly. Just to watch these two marvelous actresses interact is a joy. Lindsay Duncan also gives a first-rate performance. As the series moves on, the style and feel of each episode changes a bit and real injections of menace, tension, and fear are palpable.  These are contrasted with the down-to-earth, determined and practical calm of McKenzie's Miss Marple. In essence, then, Series 5 is a wonderful collection -- rich, nuanced, and rather splendid.",1314144000,27,1329,5.191588785046729
3952863,1,B002MUAXJY,"What a disappointment! If the producers of this series want to write their own stories and have a different type of detective, why not just do so?

3952865,5,B002MUAXJY,"The scripts are well-written and the sets exquisite. As a huge fan of Suchet's Poirot i am even tempted to say that this series is as good if not better than Suchet's Poirot in terms of the plots. You will be hard pressed to finger the killer !

You may wish to buy the Series 5 to be released in June 2011 by Amazon UK as that contains an additional episode titled Pale Horse which is not in this set. I don't know why they would use the same set numbering and yet have different episodes. Ms Marple would be puzzled by this marketing technique.",1303344000,4,546,4.2

3952867,2,B002MUAXJY,"Miss Marple has never been so boring and it has nothing to do with the wonderful Julia McKenzie. The problem lies with the liberties the writers took with the original story lines and characters.

The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side:
 - Joanna Lumley as Dolly Bantry is her usual engaging self;
 - Not much to care about regarding the other characters;
 - Not much else to say except they DID actually stick pretty well to the original story line;

The Secret of Chimneys:
 - The only resemblance to the original storyline is the house named Chimneys and there's a diamond involved, but the latter is not the main focus of the story as it is in this DVD adaptation;
 - Miss Marple wasn't in the original story so it's a bit odd to have her plopped down in it here;

The Blue Geranium:
 - This was originally a short story included in ""The Thirteen Problems;""
 - Miss Marple's only involvement in the original story was after-the-fact. The murder had already been solved so she simply guessed the correct outcome, yet she is the one who figures it all out in the DVD version;
 - Sharon Small as Mary Pritchard is terribly unlikeable. I know the character is likely written that way but Mary is REALLY unsympathetic. When she dies, I am happy and don't really care she was murdered. LOVE Sharon Small normally: hate Mary Pritchard.

Agatha Christie's Garden
 - Thumbs up! Includes a bio, information about her personal retreat in Devon, and a few other bits. Enjoyable.",1283558400,11,1468,4.621621621621622
3952868,3,B002MUAXJY,"The original Christie story about the Secrets of Chimneys is so different from this version. Who makes the decision to make all these changes? Still, it was quite confusing & interesting, so worth the purchase.",1283472000,,210,5.0285714285714285
3952869,5,B002MUAXJY,"First let me say that I have these DVDs in hand & have watched them, they are the uncut 89 minute U.K. versions, not the trimmed versions shown on PBS.

Of the new Marple series, this is probably the best set yet.
Julia Mckenzie is more at ease in her second year as Miss Marple.  She explains her take on the character in a texted interview.  She feels that the early Miss Marple stories depict the sleuth as a fragile Victorian lady, while in the later stories she is more of a tweedier & solid detective.  It is this later Miss Marple that Julia has chosen for the personality in these episodes.

This set benefits from two mysteries that have not been dramatized before (correct me if I am wrong).  The best being a Miss Marple short story THE BLUE GERANIUM, at an hour and a half it does not feel padded out.  These are the stories that this new series should have gone for in the first place, rather than re-doing the earlier masterpieces by Joan Hickson.  There are so many Miss Marple short stories that have not been dramatized that it is a shame it took 5 years for the new series to recognize them.  The short stories worked well for the Poirot series, I hope that we will see more of these brought to life.

The individual DVDs are numbered as volumes, but there are no plans to sell them separately.

Volume 1: THE MIRROR CRACKED FROM SIDE TO SIDE (2009) 89 minutes - with Joanna Lumeley.  While in its own right this is an very enjoyable mystery, well staged & filmed. If you are not familiar with the story it will keep you guessing until the end.  The time line based on the cars and Cinemascope movies at the local theater Miss Marple attends puts this story around 1955, a little later than I imagine most Miss Marple stories to take place.  As this is a re-make from the earlier 1992 classic Joan Hickson series (which ran 100 minutes), fans will be tempted to compare the two presentations.  But if you ignore the first version, you will enjoy this slicker production.

Volume 2: THE SECRET OF THE CHIMNEYS (2010) 89 minutes. Not originally a Miss Marple story, Christie fans will grit their teeth at the re-writing of her story to add Miss Marple to the goings on, but the average fan will enjoy the intriguing mystery.  Miss Marple generally seems to be slightly out of place in these modified stories, here she seems strangely un-interested in the mystery going on and just helps the amateur sleuths of the original story with suggestions & ideas.  It is still a great mystery and probably would not have been dramatized today without Miss Marple being in it.  There are many changes made to the story, which amalgamates and renames several characters, turns the political connection from the fictitious Herzoslovakia to Austria , and comprehensively changes both the murderer's identity and motive. But viewing this as its own mystery and not comparing it to the original 1929 book, I still found it entertaining and will keep the 5 star rating.

Volume 3: THE BLUE GERANIUM (2010) 88 minutes, a minute shorter than the other two,  This is the prize of the set, a Miss Marple short story never dramatized before by the great Joan Hickson.  Stories like this should have been the mission of the new series, to dramatize the yet un adapted Miss Marple stories.  The story is told in flash-back as Miss Marple relates the strange goings on to her friend Sir Henry Clithering, retired from Scotland yard.  This helps her weed through the clues and solve the mystery.

Disc 4 is a bonus documentary AGATHA CHRISTIE'S GARDEN, MURDER & MYSTERY AT DEVON.  The DVD case states it runs 66 minutes, but I clock it in at only 60 minutes plus an aditional 9 minutes of interviews not used in the final cut of the documentary.  The garden was Agatha Christie's retreat of solitude.  It is not open to the public & is in the process of restoration, so this is your best bet to see where she may have gotten many of her story ideas.

Other bonus material is Text-Only: An interview with Julia McKenzie; An interview with Joanna Lumley; Background information about the shooting locations; Limited cast filmographies & a brief history of Agatha Christie (strangely repeated on the discs & originally from another set).

All of the mysteries are presented in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen standard definition, they appear slightly soft (maybe for effect) but not grainy.  The stereo audio is acceptable with the music giving the best separation.  Optional subtitles will help you with any British accents.",1280793600,43,4508,4.652777777777778
3952870,5,B002MUAXJY,"Only the Bible outsells Agatha Christie. Both have the nay-sayers, but Marple is a FUN crime series, book or film. This set is released immediately after airing on PBS Masterpiece Mystery! on American TV. Series 5 includes three stories that revolve around a murder, or more, in grande olde English Estate houses. The scenic view is as riveting as the crime solving and suspense. All of the stories included in this series are period pieces, the 1950s. Marple is played by Julia McKenzie ('Cranford') for her second series in the role. Many have said she ""looks"" the Marple part that Christie wrote. She has a huge supporting cast of British stars in each episode.

This DVD set comes with a 4th disc which provides a picturesque and informative look at the hide-away estate of Agatha Christie, just now being readied for opening to the public. The bonus disc is more than an hour long and has added bonus materials to the primary feature.

""THE MIRROR CRACK'D FROM SIDE TO SIDE""  89 min. subtitled
Marple injures her ankle just as a film star, Marina (Lindsay Duncan) is going to hold a garden party benefit for the St. Mary Mead village locals. A fan/guest (Caroline Quentin) is poisoned by a drink. Who was it really meant to kill? Dolly (Joanna Lumley) sold Gossington Hall to the star. She tries to help Marple and the Yard find the killer. But there are so many suspects, typical of all Agatha Christie murder mysteries. You'll not be disappointed, and the interior of the estate (Dorney Court in reality) is as wonderful as the gardens. Bonus: text interviews with McKenzie and Lumley, cast filmographies, and Agatha Christie anniversary info.

""THE SECRET OF CHIMNEYS""  89 min. subtitled
Marple joins Lady Virginia at her family estate, Chimneys. Much of the murder mystery takes place inside this aesthetic architecture (Knebworth House--Lytton Family--""Lytton Diaries""?) Lord Caterham (Edward Fox) opens the Chimneys home to Count Ludwig who ends up dead. There is a bevy of suitors for Virginia, many other guests, and family, each seemingly with a motif for murder. The investigation leans on finding details to a 1932 party in the house when the Mycore Diamond was stolen and Agnes, a 19-year-old maid, disappeared. Scotland Yard's Finch (Stephen Dillane) teams with Marple for answers. Expect some romance with this murder tale. Bonus: Knebworth House facts and filmographies.

""THE BLUE GERANIUM""  89 min. subtitled
A murderer is about to be convicted 6 months after a death, and suddenly Marple is explaining to retired Scotland Yarder, Sir Henry (Donald Sinden) why the confessed murderer is the wrong person. So flash back to prior events. An earlier suspicious death. And what a group of suspects. Meet the Pritchards: Mary (Sharon Small) 'The Blue Geranium' dead; George (Toby Stephens-'Robin Hood') hubby but former beau of Mary's sis, Philippa (Claudie Blakley-'Lark Rise to Candleford' ma) married to Lewis (Paul Rhys) bro to Geo. Confused? There's more suspects. Wait will you try to figure out the murder(s). And toss in for flavor, Hazel (Caroline Catz-I so missed her when she left as girlfriend on 'Doc Martin'; a wonderful funny series.) Agatha outdid herself on weaving this murder web. Summerleigh is the house. The story was originally an Agatha Christie short story.

3952871,2,B002MUAXJY,"Joan Hickson will always be the quintessential Miss Marple, at once proper, dignified, reserved, determined, possessing a sly but understated wit and, most importantly, an  uncannily perceptive mind. Geraldine McEwan took some liberties with the Marple character, infusing her with a mischievous eye, while at the same time giving the impression of a kindly grandmother, but she wisely kept the keen skills of perception at Marple's core.

Julia McKenzie has added nothing to these character traits, and has, most unfortunately, eliminated the one that is central to enjoying any portrayal of Miss Marple: her unfailing ability to understand human nature. It is Marple's hallmark characteristic, and without it, there's really no point in watching.

McKenzie's Marple is bland to the point of being almost invisible. She's like a shadow in the room. She sits and quietly sips tea. She gazes without animation at whoever is speaking. Her dialog is limited, and when she does speak, it is merely to ask a decidedly unpointed question or offer a vapid opinion which has little or nothing to do with the mystery at hand.

Some of the blame for this must be directed at the writers, certainly, for not providing their actor with enough material, or the proper material, to show us this side of Marple's personality. But revealing personality is part of an actor's job. Both Hickson and McEwan live up to this responsibility admirabliy. In every episode, we watch them sizing up the varied assortment of characters they encounter. We see it in the knowing glint of their eyes; we hear it in the wry, ironic tone of their voices. But McKenzie gives us none of this. Indeed, she gives us little at all beyond a conservative old English lady in a tweed suit. It's a shallow performance that at times verges on empty, and, as any fan of Agatha Christie's spinster sleuth knows, Miss Marple is anything but.",1279324800,15,1896,4.952830188679245
3952872,5,B002MUAXJY,"I am not certain why so many seem to dislike this particular Miss Marple, but for anyone who has read the Miss Marple Mysteries by Agatha Christie, as I have, Julia McKenzie's portrayal of Miss Marple is a breath of fresh air.  She has been able to capture the essence of the Miss Marple that Agatha Christie so wonderfully wrote about in her mystery novels.",1278374400,18,358,4.507692307692308
3952873,1,B002MUAXJY,"The new Miss Marple has no relationship to the character created by Christie; she no longer understands ""the world through the prism of her village of St. Mary Meade"".  She is nice/sweet doesn't seem to grasp that Evil is in the world.  The story lines have some resemblance to the books but not much a couple looked as though it was armature casting.

I am disappointed if these are BBC productions because in comparison to the Poirot series, Inspector Lewis and Dalziel & Pascoe they are really bad.",1277856000,13,501,4.670454545454546
3952874,4,B002MUAXJY,"In Series 5, ""Agatha Christie's Marple"" has finally settled on a consistent style. The bold palette looks like Technicolor, and the acting style is also reminiscent of the decade in which the mysteries take place, the 1950s. We've seen this off-and-on in previous seasons, but now it has lost its clumsiness. Although the mysteries are sordid and melodramatic, they don't go over the top to the point of distraction, as has sometimes been the case in previous seasons. Again the writers have adapted various source materials to serve Miss Marple. ""The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side"" is, of course, a Marple novel. But ""The Secret of Chimneys"" is a Superintendent Battle novel whose plot has been entirely changed. And ""The Blue Geranium"" is adapted from a Marple short story.

Julia McKenzie plays Marple as a practical, plainspoken woman whom one would probably not mistake for a dotty old lady. The extent to which the police detectives do, however, varies. In ""The Secret of Chimneys"", the Scotyard Yard detective is familiar with Miss Marple's reputation for solving mysteries, and he seems to expect her to contribute to the case. ""The Blue Geranium""'s detective tends to think her a nuisance who couldn't possibly be of much help. It might be nice to have deeper characterizations of the detectives, but there are so many characters in these stories that there is no time for any of them in depth. It's a credit to the actors that some characters come across strongly. In any case, I found Series 5 the most consistently entertaining of the ""Marple"" series thus far.

An American movie star moves to St. Mary Mead in ""The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side"". Marina Gregg (Lindsay Duncan) has settled into Gossington Hall with her much-younger English husband, film director Jason Rudd (Nigel Harman), and taken to English country life in a grand fashion. Miss Marple's friend Dolly Bantry (Joanna Lumley) is beside herself with excitement over her new neighbors. And seemingly the whole town turns out for a formal party hosted by Ms. Gregg. But one of the guests, a ""garrulous spinster"" and huge fan named Heather Badcock (Caroline Quentin), drops dead after consuming a poisoned cocktail, and it looks like the intended target may have been Ms. Gregg. This is a stylish, fun mystery featuring Joanna Lumley in a terrific comic role.

""The Secret of Chimneys"" harkens back to a party held on the estate in 1932, during which a chambermaid and a priceless diamond brooch went missing. Chimneys is one of England's grandest private residences, owned by the family of Lord Caterham (Edward Fox). The British government wants to use the estate to woo Austrian Count Ludwig van Stainach (Anthony Higgins) to sell them rights to iron ore. Miss Marple, cousin to Caterham's deceased wife and friend to their daughter  Virginia (Charlotte Salt), will be joining the eclectic guest list, which includes a woman trying to acquire the house for the National Heritage. But there is a gunshot in the night, and the Count is found dying in the arms of a rival for Virginia's affections, Anthony Cade (Jonas Armstrong).

""The Blue Geranium"" is told in flashback, as Miss Marple implores her friend Sir Henry (Donald Sinden) to intervene to prevent the wrong man from being hanged for the murders of his wife and mistress. Some time ago, Miss Marple traveled to the picturesque village of Little Ambrose. On the bus, she met a distraught man who later turned up dead on the golf course. Only a day later, Mary Pritchard (Sharon Small), the widely detested wife of airline magnate George Pritchard (Toby Stephens) is found dead in her room, apparently from fright, having been warned by a fortune teller that the appearance of a blue geranium would spell her demise. This mystery is a lot of fun, builds some suspense, and gets the viewer guessing as to what the characters are all up to.",1277596800,64,3880,4.899543378995434

3952877,1,B002MUAXJY,"Review is of ""mirror cracked""--maybe the next two in the series coming to PBS are better, but since PBS is spreading them out, I think they know they're no good, so they're not even trying to build momentum.

This one was just phoned in. It's as if everyone involved said ""well, this has been done well twice before"" (though those previous ones couldn't be more different from each other, both were enjoyable) so we'll just wing it. The reductionism of the script (removing characters, changing their motivations, leaving out key plot points) may streamline a typically Christie-esque book, but it has left the story a mess. If indeed PBS cut ten minutes, maybe they botched the edit-- or maybe they spared me ten minutes I'd never get back. Wow, this one is a real disappointment.",1275868800,17,781,4.785185185185185
3952878,3,B002MUAXJY,"As of this date, only the first installment - ""A Mirror Crack'd"" has aired on PBS - too early to condemn the other episodes - yet.
BUT WHERE IS THE 4TH EPISODE?
ITV filmed 4 - PBS has only announced airing these 3 included on the DVD
""A Pale Horse"" is not mentioned.

Also, as usual, PBS has lopped off 10 mins from the film to make room for the lengthy Masterpiece intro, the blathering of Alan Cummings (at least it's not Gillian Anderson) and the hawking of the DVD at the end - leaving 79 mins as broadcast out of 89 mins of the UK version.  Good luck getting a pledge out of me!
Thanks PBS -

That said, the missing 10 mins probably would not lift this version to greatness.  It is acceptable, just not the best ever filmed.  The older versions can't be compared on production values to these newest HD broadcasts, but the script adaptations and acting are not up to the past outings.  McKenzie does a fair job and Lummley is always fun to watch, but I would agree with the other reviewers - Hickson is still my favorite Marple and the 1980 one-of with Lansbury and Taylor is much better.

Here's hoping the next 2 PBS airings will be better - if not, Poirot airs in July!",1274745600,15,1177,4.251121076233184
8374078,5,B002MUAXJY,"I am a fan of the Christie movies and own most of them.  I only purchased ""The Pale Horse"" and found it to be a very interesting adaptation of the book by the same name.  The movie took a different direction than the book by introducing Miss Marple into the story.  That was a surprise to me and the reason I wanted to see the movie.  I believe turning this into a Miss Marple mystery actually improved the plot from that in the original book which included, instead, Ariadne Oliver and did not feature Miss Marple at all.",1527465600,,522,4.295918367346939
