2069488,4,B000297NMM,"I am pleased so far, this seems to be very helpful. But for a beginner like myself it is a little advanced, but it breaks notes down very well and with time and practice it definitely will make a difference.",1220400000,,207,4.2
2069489,4,B000297NMM,"I like this video. It moves slowly enough to follow without using the accompanying TAB sheets. I appreciate that the accompanying literature takes me slightly beyong a ""beginner"" skill level.",1141776000,6,191,5.4
2069490,5,B000297NMM,"I purchased this DVD because I have never been able to figure out the whole process of strumming chords and singing songs at the same time.  I am totally self-taught and find that to be a harder skill than playing a melody.

Pete Wernick does a fine job of putting together about 10 tunes with only two chords (G and D7) and singing them at a slow speed (easy to strum along, then eventually strum and sing along).  Then, he adds the C chord and we get to do another 10 songs.  The program concludes with a basic forward roll, which we are to learn well, then go back and do all the songs with the roll instead of a simple strum.  The conclusion is a simple version of ""When the Saints Go Marching In"" with the forward roll.

Songs are: Handsome Molly, Tom Dooley, Skip to my Lou, Take Me Back to Tulsa, My Home's Across the Blue Ridge Mountains, Wake Up Darling Corey, Jambalaya, Shady Grove, Katie Daley, Little Birdie, John Henry, Roll in my Sweet Baby's Arms, She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain, When the Saints Go Marching In, New River Train, You Are My Sunshine, Long Journey Home, Jesse James, Goin' Where the Chilly Winds Don't Blow, Sittin' On Top of the World, Jingle Bells, Auld Lang Syne, and Nine Pound Hammer.

The booklet has lyrics and chords, but you learn the melody from watching and listening to the recording.  Since all of these are presented in G, some are a little too high for Wernick (and me) to sing comfortably, but he does give a (very brief) overview of how to transpose to C.  I can't do it yet, but maybe soon.

I use a clawhammer bump-ditty, so the bluegrass roll isn't important to me.  If I wanted to learn bluegrass rolls, this presentation was very straightforward and I would use it for getting started.

Well, the proof is in the result.  I can now sing several basic songs (not all of the songs on the DVD are bluegrass) while strumming along.  That was my entire goal and I got there with this recording.  For what it is, it deserves the full five stars.

Please note: if you already can sing along to an instrument while you strum, this DVD is not for you.  If you are totally clueless about how to put the banjo and the voice together, this is a darned good disk. It really is just what I needed for getting started on what should be a very basic skill.",1125532800,31,2298,4.331775700934579

2069498,4,B000297NMM,It's a really good video for getting started but it could've been a little longer. I like to use the medley section to practice keeping up with other people when I don't have anyone to play with.,1394928000,,195,4.297297297297297
2069499,5,B000297NMM,"This is the speed at which this old guy needs in the new adventure of banjo playing. On one of the reviews someone critiqued Pete's singing, was not aware you needed to be a pro singer to play and sing along with the songs. Pete is just showing us we are real people having real fun. I am enjoying this, if it was less than fun, I'd probably give it up. Pete shows we can have a great time learning. Thanks Pete for helping this old guy have fun learning.",1394496000,4,455,4.066666666666666
2069500,4,B000297NMM,"If you're new to stringed instruments, this is a good start. Very basic, easy to follow songs and instructions. I'm using it together with lessons from Banjo Ben on the internet. Get Rolling! helps to keep you on an even tempo when you play along with the songs.",1390694400,,262,4.479166666666667

8024243,5,B000297NMM,"So much fun. I didn't know I would be jamming so quickly on my Ole Banjo! Easy, Peazy. He goes slow, and the DVD allows you to stop, and practice, then go right back to where you left off. You learn a lot of easy songs to pick, and strum quickly. You also get in on a few jam sessions. Price was right, and Pete is a very good teacher if you don't have the bucks to have one, on one live lessons. Can't get no better.",1470355200,,417,3.8045977011494254
8024244,5,B000297NMM,"I am brand new at the banjo and this DVD really helped me ""get rolling"".  Pete Wernick is great teacher and his style of teaching has you playing songs right away.  What is really beneficial to the new player, in my opinion, is the ""jam"" at the end with Pete and 2 of his students where you play along with them songs included in the lessons.  Learning how to concentrate and keep up with other players is not as easy as you may think,, at least for a newbie like me, so it's great practice for future jam opportunities.  Also, as you continue learning you can go back and jam, incorporating newly acquired techniques, endlessly!  The music in the lessons is not included in hard copy with the DVD, it will have to be downloaded from your computer, easy enough (in my case with a little help from my computer savvy husband).  In another review someone complained about Pete Wernick's singing, it's not worth complaining about and you can't learn the songs unless he sings them!  I so enjoyed this DVD that I also bought Pete's ""Beginning Bluegrass Banjo"" DVD where you add to what you've learned with ""Get Rolling"".",1464566400,3,1115,4.545
