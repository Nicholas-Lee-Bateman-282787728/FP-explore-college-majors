8525810,4,B0085ZPU20,I live in Omaha. It was interesting see to it in a movie and I knew the places where it was shot. My favorite shot is the bathroom scene at Lonnells. You have to live here to appreciate what I'm talking about. I liked seeing people I know in the movie and I than Omowale for considering Omaha for his first film. Had a chance to hangout with Meshach for spell. The two actresses were really very beautiful ladies inside and out off screen. I thought their characterizations were too over the top. O. A. Thanks for giving North Omaha a memorable story!,1371686400,,551,4.359223300970874
