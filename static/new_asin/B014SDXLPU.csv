8731739,5,B014SDXLPU,Hero full of his classic movies from the late 1950s and early 70s you get three Sinbad movies and Jason and the Argonauts at a great price. If you are fans of Ray harryhausen you're going to love this box set it is a must own. For some reason it says region full on the box but it does play on American DVDs players. These movies never grow old they get better with age.,1503792000,,370,4.013513513513513
