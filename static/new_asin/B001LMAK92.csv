3686939,1,B001LMAK92,I was looking for the newer cartoon. This one is the Older drawn looking one. My son won't even watch it. Total waste of money.,1348185600,,127,4.12
3686940,4,B001LMAK92,"My son recently became interested in the BB on Sprout.  I always like to have a DVD copy handy of his favorite shows.  This one is okay.  I'd say from the early 80s. The animation/drawing is older to the ""adult"" eye. The Springtime Suprises has some creepy/weird annimation and he isn't the biggest fan, but he will still watch it.  His first choice are the newer episodes on Sprout.  But, the price is right and you can't go wrong with Amazon Prime!",1342915200,,450,4.439024390243903
3686941,3,B001LMAK92,"We still liked the movie, but it is the older version of characters just so you know. My kids like the newer ones better.",1342137600,,121,4.083333333333333
3686942,5,B001LMAK92,I remember watching this on VHS all the time as a kid with my little brother and then one day it struck me to find it on DVD.  My girlfriend couldn't understand why I'd want to watch such a childish video and really gave me a funny look when I started laughing and could even remember all the words to the songs.  Brings back great memories.,1310515200,2,341,4.151515151515151
3686943,5,B001LMAK92,"Theres no question that an animated property like the Berenstain Bears that has been around for over 30 years (the books even longer than that!) would have different generations of fans. Especially when you consider it's had 3 incarnations.. The first being the Primetime specials from 79 and the early 80's. The second was the mid 80's Saturday Morning series. And of course the third being the PBS series from the mid 2000's.

Most people who grew up with the primetime specials also were fans of the mid 80s show since they fell so close together in the timeline. But very few fans of the most recent version care for the classic series. So 'bear' that in mind as you read through reviews.

What happens is people buy a DVD (or rent) simply because it says Berenstain Bears and they naturally assume it's ""their"" Berenstain Bears. So they pop it in and find the starting is different for one thing then notice the character voices are wrong or perhaps the film and drawing style look old to them so they watch it with a discerning eye and conclude it's crap because it's somehow a knockoff of their version. Allegedly their children have no interest either for these same reasons and so they just blew 15 bucks for nothing and write a review to try to 'warn' other people not to be duped as well.

But in reality their situation is really just a case of a lack of TV History knowledge. And for that reason a very good and just as beloved series (from a different generation) shouldn't be slammed and criticized because of aggravation over a mismade purchase.

With that said if you are a fan of the classic series you will be really glad to get this disc. Not only will you get the Classic ""Easter Surprise"" primetime special in this collection which has never been released on DVD before .. but also various episodes from the Classic Saturday Morning series.

And for people who have never seen either version give this a try as well and make up your own mind.",1265414400,35,1964,4.536723163841808
3686944,2,B001LMAK92,"This is a newly released DVD??  It is soooo old, the quality is TERRIBLE, the voices are different - there is some really odd singing - and it does not seem at all like the current episodes we see on TV.  Glad we just rented it from the library!",1243987200,2,245,3.979591836734694
3686945,5,B001LMAK92,"We love the Berenstain Bears, especially the older shows.  This DVD has the Easter special which is one of our favorites.  We have been looking for it for several years and were very glad to finally find it available.",1238803200,10,217,4.538461538461538
3686946,1,B001LMAK92,I was a little more than disappointed when I purchased this at Target last week.  The voices are not the bears I am used to and I found that bothersome.  It wasn't the same to me...and my daughter knew something was different too- she had ZERO interest in it.,1237852800,5,259,4.26530612244898
3687087,2,B001LMAK92,This isn't the original Berenstain Bears I love. Mostly song and very little dialogue. Very disappointed.,1426809600,,105,5.625

3687089,5,B001LMAK92,I am a teacher and my students love watching these. This DVD includes the Easter Surprise which was their favorite. I like that these short stories always have a good moral or lesson for the audience.,1396742400,2,200,4.583333333333333

3687091,3,B001LMAK92,"Berenstain Bears are a cute, clean type of movie/entertainment for my young daughter.  Once she gets even a little older (she is 4), I think she will lose interest in these type of movies.",1368230400,,188,4.529411764705882
3687092,1,B001LMAK92,We love the episodes on PBS so I wanted to order some to have to watch anytime and in the van. These episodes are older ones and the graphics are terrible and the characters look different and the voices are way different. It says the date is 2009 so you would figure they are current. If you are looking for the good episodes do not get these. I will look for another option.,1365465600,,376,4.164383561643835
3687093,5,B001LMAK92,Parents please make sure your preschoolers are watching the Bernstein bears--these sweet cartoons always teach a strong moral lesson in a way that my kids find engaging and funny:). They also instill a strong sense of love and family not commonly found in other cartoons. Much better than sponge bob for impressionable young minds:),1364515200,,332,5.166666666666667
