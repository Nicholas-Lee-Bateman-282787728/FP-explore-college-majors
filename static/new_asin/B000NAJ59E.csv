Love the ball routine too...Great price too....<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Turbo-Jam-Kickin-Core-DVD-by-Chalene-Johnson/dp/B000NAJ59E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Turbo Jam Kickin' Core DVD by Chalene Johnson</a>",1320537600,,329,9.64516129032258
2764002,3,B000NAJ59E,"I am happy with my purchase(workout DVD) although it was only one out of the three I actually ordered . It could be longer cardio. (cardio portions moves very quick but basic.) Instructions are good, not enough of a workout(45min. in total) Last 15 minutes are exersises done with a stability ball. very basic. Would have been, a good workout if it were to be combined with the other DVDs That I never received.",1317600000,,411,4.5675675675675675
2764003,2,B000NAJ59E,I didn't know what to expect from this video but bought it on the recommendation of a friend who loves the turbo jam videos.  Was disappointed because it was difficult to understand the leader saying what movement was coming up next and often she didn't say at all.  You obviously just need to love the OTHER turbojam movies and get this one as an addition to that collection.  It's not meant to be an introduction to the exercise genre.,1237939200,,437,4.506329113924051
2764004,4,B000NAJ59E,"There's a 30 minute cardio party for the first part, which is fun, but not as fun as some of the other ones; only the last 15 minutes uses the ball... you do moves that don't 100% target the core, but it's still interesting. Sometimes I just do the Cardio Party part, do something else, and then to finish off, do the ball portion.",1228089600,6,331,4.1875
2764005,5,B000NAJ59E,"I just love this DVD! The music is great and the routines are fun. I love the moves she teaches you in all the routines. Working with the ball is really fun as well! This has now become one of my favorite workouts with Chalene. The total body workout with the ball is also great! I wish she would make some more workouts with the ball. If you love Chalene Johnson, you will love this one too! A must for your collection!",1226361600,4,420,4.134146341463414
2764006,5,B000NAJ59E,"This is my favorite Turbo Jam workout and I have them all! I love the music and Chalene is so fun! I bought this dvd as a set with Total Body Blast and I like how a stability ball is used in the Turbo Jam moves, how cool! I can't wait for Chalene to come out with more Turbo Jam dvds!",1186963200,5,284,3.6721311475409837

8176432,4,B000NAJ59E,"It took me a long time to try Turbo Jam though I like many other workout DVDs, and was really surprised to find how much I loved it. Charlene is very energetic and yes, perky, but in a way that feels genuine and not annoying like some that are over the top. There is a genuine sense of fun. The only reason I do not give it five stars is that you really need the intro DVD to get some of the sequences. I am slowly unraveling them but it would have helped to have at least a short segment at the beginning introducing the key sequences used throughout. (A few moves are shown more slowly, but not all.) But it is a good workout and definitely fun.",1471737600,,647,4.0625
8176433,3,B000NAJ59E,"Not what I expected.  I thought this entire dvd would be a ball workout, but approximately 3/4 of the workout is Chalene's usual routines from the Turbo Jam series.  The last 1/4 of the workout is a fun ball workout.  I do wish she had done the entire workout with the ball.",1442793600,2,274,4.230769230769231
