8448755,5,B004YQXBM0,"Since this title looked suspiciously familiar, I did a little research and found that this is a re-issue of the excellent ""La Guerre d' Algerie,"" by directors Yves Courriere and Phillippe Monnier.  It was released in France in March 1972 and later released to English speaking viewers in 1975. It has been re-released a few more times since and I recall watching portions of this excellent documentary on a PBS channel in the late 1980s.  The original was 4 hours and 40 minutes long, but this version is divided into four sets, each with three DVDs ranging between 104 and 150 minutes of viewing time. As I recall, it provides not only a history of the conflict, but its origins, and shows contemporary news footage of the conflict as well as interviews from the various participants, journalists who covered this conflict, and political advisors of the time from the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) to the office of French President De Gaulle.

The documentary was originally released only 10 years after the end of the war when the conflict was still fresh on the minds of both the French and the Algerians as well as other participants.  According to the IMBd, ""cobblestones were thrown at the faade of the Saint-Sverin Cinema as a screening of ""La guerre d'Algrie"" took place in Paris on 22nd October 1971"".  The war still has a bitter impact on both countries to this day. It was not until 1999 that the Algerian War was allowed to be taught in French public schools.

This whole tragedy might possibly had been averted as late as only five years before the war had France recognized the Algerians as French citizens and bestowed all the rights of citizenship. However, many French politicians feared that French culture would be deluded and become Moslem oriented, and would result in a shift of political power. They were supported by the Pied Noir, the French citizens of Algeria, for whom the status quo gave them political and economical advantage over the native Algerians. The end result was tragic.

An observation I may want to add is that we Americans view this sad episode as just another hopeless colonial war.  However, for the French, Algeria was France and was considered another department of Metropolitan France no different than one of the 50 States of our Union. Therefore, a majority of the French people viewed it as a war no different as if Texas or California decided it wanted to secede from the U.S. and become independent. The French tried to convince NATO to enter the war claiming that Metropolitan France was being attacked by an insurgency supported by an external threat - Nasser's Egypt and the Soviets.  The Eisenhower Administration refused to buy that line of thinking and voted against it. This added just another reason for resentment and mistrust by the soon to be elected President Charles de Gaulle and would have significant ramifications on American-French relations within the decade following the war.",1410566400,2,2960,4.904
8448756,5,B004YQXBM0,"This is the second part of a three-DVD documentary covering the French war in Algeria in the 1950s and 1960s. The one covers the events related to the army causing the fall of the French government and its replacement by a government led by De Gaulle. Its excellent in showing the weak and divided nature of the French government in that era. Its good at showing how the strength of the army grew through the war to be enough to challenge the state itself (and win).

Its also good at making the point that a complete military victory in the war would still not ""win"" the war for France. That there was really was ultimately no battlefield solution to the war other than to keep fighting it forever at the cost of military and economy decay in France as a whole. They do a good job in showing how well France did in terms of fighting the war and how generally effective their strategies were. But as well how those strategies could led to no better than a stalement.

The writing of the series is excellent. They also managed to interview a great many of the participants on both sides. All around, very interesting history.",1396224000,3,1124,4.478048780487805
