8341654,5,B001TJ8OYA,"The Body Electric Workout is a 60 minute total body workout led by Margaret Richard, host of the PBS exercise show Body Electric. It was originally released on VHS, but is also on DVD on her two-DVD Classics collection (I have the DVDs, which are chaptered). Joining her are five dancers from her show: Joe, Jules, BeNisa, Jane, and Donna. However, only four are present for each segment. The set is the 1990 Body Electric set, and the music is original music written for the workout (a jazzy pop/R&B sound, with most songs including vocals!). You will need a mat, and light weights (Margaret and crew use three pound dumbbells). I use 5 lb. Dumbbells for the tricep and bicep work, and 3 pound weights for the deltoids. For the floor work, ankle weights can be used to increase the intensity.

If youve never done Margarets workouts, her workouts use light weights and high repetitions. She doesnt count reps, but works the muscle to fatigue in a time frame of about three to three-and-a-half minutes per muscle group. A variety of rep patterns and tempos are utilized for each section, including singles, power pulse (pulse twice while in the contraction), pulses, slow rep speeds (up 2, down 2; up 3, down 1, etc.), and alternating. Before working each muscle group, Margaret briefly goes over the form for each exercise before beginning.

The workout is as follows:
-Warmup (nice graceful movements and dynamic stretches)
-Pectorals (pushups and pushups with back stretches)
-Triceps (supine tricep extensions, a.k.a. skull-crushers, using weights)
-Biceps (standing curls, both to the front and to the side)
-Deltoids/Shoulders (standing pec deck/butterflies, standing chest presses, and a unique scissor move I haven't seen before)
-Abdominals (crunch variations)
-Outer thighs (floor work: side leg lifts, shoot-outs, and clams)
-Inner thighs (done in a supine position, legs over hips, open and close legs in various patterns)
-Hamstrings (all fours work: hamstring curls, bent leg raises)
-Gluteals (bridgework, or supine gluteal tucks; including knee presses)
-Hamstrings (all fours work done on the other leg)
-Quadriceps (standing plie squats and stationary lunges)
-Cool down (a series of graceful arm movements, but no stretches are performed)

Although the exercises are fairly standard, the high repetitions, various rep patterns, and Margarets twist on some of the exercises will make your muscles burn. I really enjoyed the music, which is a nice jazzy pop and R&B mix. Most of the songs include vocals, which is a nice change of pace from the typical instrumental music found on most workout videos. The form pointers before each exercise didn't distract me, as I used them as much-needed stretch breaks before moving on (since Margaret doesnt stretch in the cool down). However, some may find these pointers distracting each time you use the workout. The only things I don't like about this workout are the abdominal work (too crunch-heavy and focuses primarily on the upper abs) and cool down (no much-needed stretches are performed). This workout can be found on Margarets Classics collection (a two-DVD set, which also includes three of her other older workouts). While the setting and outfits are dated by todays standards, this classic workout is useful even today, and I highly recommend it for all fitness levels.",1490400000,,3340,5.158671586715867
