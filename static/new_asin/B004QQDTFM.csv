The young professor (played by a very young Sunil Dutt) is presenting a classic story of a guru who falls in love with a woman of ill repute (called a prostitute, but that might be overstating the case).

The professor lives alone with his widowed mother, who is furiously trying to find a bride for him.  (This is rather a standard situation in these sorts of stories.)  The mother has a slight accident, and they fear that she is going to die.  She begs him to get married, and panics, thinking that she will die without ever seeing his bride.

A buddy, of questionable character, says that he will find a fake ""fiancee"" for the young professor.  The girl in question is a sort of private dancer and professional flirt, played by a very young Vyjayantimala.  (Note: Vyjayantimala is a total babe, and a jewel of both the Tamil and the Hindi screen, and worth seeing in any role.)  The girl consents to come to the home of the ailing woman and her bachelor son, and pose as his fiancee.  She plays it in a very traditional style.  [Brilliant acting by V. here, beautifully understated.  Understated acting is very rare in Hindi cinema.]  Over a couple of days, Mama recovers enough to be completely won over by the fake bride, while the fake bride, in turn, is completely won over by the mother and son.

The story grinds on to its inevitable conclusion, but there are bits of pure cinematic poetry, separated by the more formulaic elements that amount to ""fan service"", though even at its most formulaic, the movie rises about the rest.  One simply cannot resist the adorable couple of Sunil Dutt and Vyjayantimala.

Black and white; at least the version I saw.  I saw the movie in a plane, and cannot vouch for the quality of the particular transfer being offered here, but I daresay it is the same thing I saw in flight, which was good.  That had English subtitles (written by someone not entirely fluent in English), and we don't know whether the present item has them.
