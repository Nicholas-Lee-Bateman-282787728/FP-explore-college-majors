8698800,3,B00SL9CUE6,"It's a B-Movie, so you have to walk into with that frame of mine. My girlfriend and I watched it as our Halloween flicks - Nuff Said.",1447200000,,133,3.962962962962963
8698801,1,B00SL9CUE6,"I watched based upon the mostly positive reviews....I don't get it.  I enjoy a B horror movie every now and then, especially when it makes fun of itself.  There were a few funny parts, but this movie took itself too seriously to satisfy that.  Very poor acting, an extremely thin storyline, and an ending that doesn't really make sense.",1441670400,2,336,4.661016949152542
8698802,4,B00SL9CUE6,"Abby Daniels (Alicia M Clark) Answers an ad for an in home caretaker for an elderly woman, Granny/Mildred (Donna Sweden) who just happens to be the kind of sweet old lady that makes masks out of dead people's faces. Sleeps in the same bed with her decomposed husband, feeds the local preacher a severed penis for breakfast and has a zero tolerance for fornication!

With the help of her equally psychotic grandson Jace (TJ Pack) they find ways to keep their freezer full of meat so they can make all kinds of cullinary treats.

This was actually a fun and gory little indie slasher flick. Some of the puns and dialogue had me laughing out loud. Yes, it borrowed from films such as TCM but nothing will ever take it's place.

The acting was passable and some of the gore effects were reminiscent of those from the 80s slashers and fun to watch. There's a hot and heavy sex scene and nudity. At only about 70 minutes they didn't waste time with unnecessary filler. While not without it's obvious flaws. I think indie slasher lovers will get a kick out of ""Kill Granny Kill"" !

8698803,5,B00SL9CUE6,"Kill Granny Kill is the latest flick from Camp Motion Pictures. Like most of their output, it is campy, gory fun. The granny is a hoot! Also, the movie has nudity and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it had some decent male nudity in it as well. Worth watching if you're a fan of Camp Motion Pictures or the kind of stuff that Troma puts out.",1432944000,5,348,4.132352941176471
8698804,4,B00SL9CUE6,"With a name like Kill Granny Kill, you know what to expect. This is a crazy low budget one. Not the best acting in the world, but fun to watch. The special effects are pretty good too. I would recommend if you like low budget horror movies. My only complaint, this was too short. Mildred Mays madness ended too soon. Id also recommend The Granny (1994) and Mom (1991) if you are looking for more killer granny horror flicks.",1431129600,5,424,4.379746835443038
8698805,5,B00SL9CUE6,LOVED IT !!! what a great movie finally something a little bit different. It was just a well done movie.....,1431043200,2,108,4.45
8698806,5,B00SL9CUE6,Love the movie! That Jace is Hott!!!!,1430956800,,37,4.428571428571429
8698807,2,B00SL9CUE6,"Although I am quite a horror fan, I found this movie to be gruesome.  Over the top. Beyond the limits of decent horror.  I have seen it all - even 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes', which is more humorous than scary.  I was really hoping to like Kill Granny Kill - it did have a few hilarious moments and that flash back to a younger Granny was appreciated but the ending was bizarre.  The situation the nephew's girlfriend finds herself in - is completely contrary to Granny's beliefs and certainly a reason for another killing spree. I guess
you would have to watch the movie to
get my point about the ending. Truly unbalanced horror.  Good luck.",1430352000,6,646,4.487179487179487
