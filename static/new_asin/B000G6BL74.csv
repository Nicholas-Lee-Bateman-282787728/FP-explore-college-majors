2600216,5,B000G6BL74,"This documentary is the most interesting, most compelling, and least biased discussion of race I have ever seen.  Anyone can benefit from watching this series.",1208649600,,159,5.36
2600217,2,B000G6BL74,"What I got out of the show is that there was a Black Family and there was a white family, each family had one kid. The show was to show that racisim was still at large in America. In my opinion the show showed that both white and Black people have racisim tendences. The whites did there's behind the Black's back. As it seem to me to be mild tounged. The Blacks did it right in the whites face in daylight walking threw the park on a sunny day. The black men had hate in there eye's and looked as if the threesome did not leave soon there would be trouble. The thing that was funny is that the white couple ""the husband"" was made up in black make up the had a black friend with them, the wife was the only white person thier. In a skin colored kind of way. even with 2 black people with her she was steered down on, and disrespected by almost every black person in the park.
In the other scene the Black man was made up in white make up. and was hanging out at an middle classish white persons kind of bar. The was several comments made about that the part of town that they where in was basicly safe, meaning it was black free. The said they all stuck together to keep out the different races from getting comfortable around there. And a few comments on why they did't want that culture in there part of town is because of how they lived, they talked down to the Black man in White make up, calling his whole race pretty much stupid and thiefs. so yeah it was a slap in the face to the black man in white make up to hear. All in all the two different colored Adult males and females bickerd over stupid crap about being culture blind to white racist abuse on the black culture. And watching the way they talk to someone in a comic kind of way. After watching the show the only people too have any kind of sence or change to them. Where both of the kids a boy and a girl, from each of a different color to there skin. It's a shame that the 2 adult males had to see the whole project with blinders on. Hell if you ask me I'd tell you that this world needs is to let the past stay in the past, because with attitude I saw from both colors of people sucked,. who sucked the most you might ask? Thats easy to see here in this show becaus everyone that had seen it said the same thing. All it took was one walk in a park on a sunny afternoon, to make my mind up. If there ever is a season 2 or part 2 too this I wouldent buy it. It wasent worth the dough to see 2 familys screw up so badly...",1199664000,,2488,3.978

2600219,3,B000G6BL74,"What happens when you put two middle class families, one black and one white, in the same house and in each others skin color? Apparently not a whole lot, nothing really happens in this documentary and utimately no message is conveyed by the end of it all.",1164499200,4,256,4.468085106382978

2600225,5,B000G6BL74,"""Black. White."" gives us a fascinating, attention-grabbing look at what it can be like ""to be"" in someone else's skin--in this case, a white family is made-up to appear black and a black family is made-up to look white all using studio quality make-up. Actually, ""despite being called `The Wurgels' (Carmen's name by marriage) the three white participants were not exactly a family in the strictest sense of the term. Film actor (referred to here as a teacher) Bruno Marcotulli, his girlfriend Carmen, and Carmen's daughter Rose Bloomfield, a child actor who starred on the Disney television show 'Movie Surfers,' until she quit shortly after being cast in Black. White, are white middle-class suburbanites from Santa Monica, California; and the Sparkses (Brian, Renee, and son Nick) are a black middle-class family from Atlanta, Georgia. True, perhaps one cannot truly understand someone of a different race simply by wearing make-up, but nevertheless this series depicts a meaningful and honest exploration of what it's like to be a person of another race.

In addition, the make-up was very convincing; it allowed people from both families to experience the world and its different cultures and attitudes in ways they otherwise never would have experienced. The two families also had to live under one roof during the six week experience and everyone understood that it was OK for disagreements and even arguments to be openly dealt with on camera. Talk about reality TV that's intelligent and insightful! Another reviewer notes that even though some offensive language was edited out of these episodes, there still may be some word that might offend more sensitive people. However, this remains an excellent, brilliant experiment (and experience) that both families--and this viewer--won't forget anytime soon.

I don't want to give away too much for fear of spoiling it all for you; but here are just a few of the situations we see: Rose, a young white girl made-up to look black, really and truly struggles to understand the way blacks experience the world--with all the good and the bad that comes with it. Carmen, the mother of the white family, does indeed overcompensate and makes a huge mistake when referring to Renee, the black mother, as a b****; Carmen actually thinks this is a friendly gesture but she quickly learns it isn't! Carmen also steps in mud when she refers to a black person as a ""creature;"" this quickly stirs tensions and it isn't the only time we see these families fight. In addition, Renee, wearing the makeup of a white person, has to put up with an incredibly dull witted man in a bar who tells her how blacks have to ""assimilate"" into white America simply because this country was founded by white people.

The two DVD set comes with some really nice extras. I particularly liked Ice Cube's music video and the original casting video. There is a make-up application slide-show and more.

Overall, this six part series does an incredibly good job of documenting an almost unique experiment in which a white family is made-up to appear black and a black family is made-up to appear white--it gives all the people involved--and the viewer--lots of food for thought. I highly recommend this two DVD set for people studying social and cultural issues between blacks and whites in America; and people interested in race and racism will not be disappointed.",1340409600,,3386,4.99822695035461
2600226,5,B000G6BL74,to be honest i had never even heard of this show until i married my black husband. it could be one of the most interesting/insightful shows i have ever seen. this is a must see show for everyone... no matter what race. it just shows how differently we treat each other because of our skin color... sad!,1328486400,,302,4.315789473684211
2600227,5,B000G6BL74,"A fascinating marvel which is sure to be interesting, and possibly very frustrating, to watch.  The make up alone is worth checking out the series and its pretty incredible that a little Hollywood movie magic can transform people off the screen so convincingly.

I am really surprised that there hasn't been more talk in the wake of this first airing on F/X years ago.  As a person of mixed heritage myself, I found this to be a gripping social experiment, even aside from some of the stupid ""reality show"" un-reality that is created around it to make it good tv.  I would love to see this viewed and discussed in seminars or classes, particularly those focused on the new buzzword ""diversity.""  The DVD comes with an accompanying study guide, but I haven't examined its utility yet because there is plenty of stuff to get a heated debate going without it.  It has been the source of some really good insights and conversations which change depending on the people watching by race, gender and generation.

 I think this is potentially a marvelous tool for bridging the gap which still seems present between races (and perhaps even generations) today. I mean, how often does someone really get a chance to be someone else in such a way that will change the way OTHERS perceive you?  I say ""potentially"" because there are a few pitfalls, and the elephant in the room is not so much a race issue, but a class issue as well - it is no accident that the people selected for this were upper-middle class families. It would change the entire dynamic in a slew of different ways to shift the economics of the situation.  I will say though, that it is not an easy topic to tackle, and believe it or not, this is by far the most respectable reality-tv I've ever seen.  Its actually SMART, despite the obvious temptation to take it someplace much more scandalous and sensational - especially considering both the topic and the network on which it aired.  I commend the producers on a job very well done.

I highly recommend buying and watching this, preferably several times, and in different company, particularly if you are a student of human nature.  I think that both the participants and the audience are afforded many opportunities to learn something, and applaud the young lady, Rose, for being someone who gives me new hope for people as a species by being a spectacular example of open-mindedness and adaptation.

On a personal note, the one thing I was a little disappointed about was something I sensed coming from the black family. Several times they mention how the white family would ""learn something"" about what it was like to be black, while they would ""get to"" experience being white.  I was disappointed that they didn't come away with a better understanding of what it must be like to always be having to avoid looking like a racist no matter what they say.  Then I realized that if there was even ground on that topic in the first place, such a show would not even have been necessary to make...

I don't recommend this for anyone with anger management issues or hyper-sensitivity regarding race though. It could end up being a little inflammatory.",1313884800,3,3158,4.690217391304348

2600229,4,B000G6BL74,I was very pleased to receive this product just as it was promised at a very reasonable price.  I am very glad to have found the DVD since I was using Netflix and since I show only a few clips a day owning the DVD is great.,1241827200,,223,3.74468085106383
2600230,4,B000G6BL74,"We Dutch people are pretty far in excepting other people's religion, colour, tradtions, etc. etc. So, it really struck me that the black vs. white issue is still so vived in the US! Wanne see what I mean?! Watch it!!!",1234483200,,217,4.45
2600231,5,B000G6BL74,"I found this profound study, Black. White., deeply fascinating. Unable to tear myself away, I stayed up until 3:30am. That it somewhat falls short in laying bare the hidden processes by which the participants arrive at each their conclusions curiously doesn't detract from the compelling nature and effectiveness of this work. Like mine, your feelings will probably veer back and forth, you will form and revise opinions as you go along and I recommend you see all six episodes to get the full value of what this series offers. Each is worth your time and my hat is off to the creators. I don't want to say too much so as not to spoil the impact and therapeutic value. I had expected this program to be informative, but it turned out to be so much more. I had not expected to be changed as a viewer, and yet, in the same way that the participants were changed inexplicably, so was I. And, lastly, I ended up loving each person.",1233446400,,927,4.491124260355029
2600232,2,B000G6BL74,"The idea behind the show was fascinating.  But it lost something in the actual execution.  The adults in both families seem determined to prove their racial counterparts wrong, rather than learn from each other.  Don't get me wrong; the white parents would inspire this reaction in anyone, especially the father.  But everyone involved (except the children) are only interested in claiming the honor of being right.  The fact that they don't maintain their public disguises for the duration of the series doesn't help matters.

As for the DVDs, I was hoping the commentary from the cast members would shed some light on the episodes.  I've only seen the ladies' commentary so far, and I didn't hear any discussion on the arguments that took place, in particular the exchange over the use of the word ""bitch"".  The show and the DVD extras proved to be disappointing all around.",1218672000,3,876,4.91156462585034

8128976,5,B000G6BL74,"Was looking for this everywhere. Amazon it was. Love the topics they address and wish they did another season. As a black man living here in America I have to say that there were some very interesting experiments and results. For instance, the episode where the black father (dressed in white face) went to the shoe store and the employee gently ""slipped' his foot into the shoe with a shoe horn. Usually, they bring the box out and you try the shoes on yourself....Love this purchase and DVD.",1473033600,,493,4.613636363636363

8128978,3,B000G6BL74,"Hmm... This series is not very insightful in its entirety. The teenage girl had the most growth and learning experience. The couple who disguised as white especially the man thoughts overshadowed any learning. Also, the black couple who disguised as white make-up wasn't done well. They still looked black to me so their experience couldn't be completely genuine. The white couple who disguised as black, well, half was open to learning. The teenage boy...no comment.

8128983,2,B000G6BL74,"The concept was a great idea, however I feel that they choose some of the worst people to make the show have drama. Some of the characters seem to highly on one spectrum and filled with complete ignorance. It could have been seen from showing how different people view racism/prejudice/stereotypes there were too many issues between the characters and some don't understand the purpose of it. Also the things that they have the children do to put them in the other races shows is not very normal in my opinion. i.e. How many white people go to etiquette school?",1392508800,,561,4.6767676767676765
