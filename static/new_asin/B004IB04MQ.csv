4385667,3,B004IB04MQ,"Only for the die hard Hope fan.  Vol. 1 & Thanks for the Memories are sensational, this one, not so much.  I was a little disappointed as these films are mainly after his prime when the times were changing and his attempt to update his shtick just didn't come off right.  Still, its Bob Hope, there are a some good laughs and a fair share of smiles in there...",1415836800,,360,4.188405797101449

4385692,4,B004IB04MQ,I was very young when Bob Hope was at the peak of his career. However this is an excellent selection of his versatility in the latter part of his acting years.,1368316800,,159,4.161290322580645
4385693,4,B004IB04MQ,It was nice to get a quality release of these Bob Hope Movies but as mentioned before it is very disappointing that these were released in 4:3 instead of 16:9 even thou it mentions 16:9 on the DVD.  Why most movie company's continue to think we of the older generation won't purchase the movies we grew up with is beyond me.  I'm always searching for the movies from the 50's 60's and 70's that I love and its annoying watching the continued release of the modern crap that is put on disk before the quality from the past.  For Bob Hope fans this is a good purchase even thou it's like your watching it as presented on TV in the 70's.  It still enjoyable to have a good copy even thou it's not in the original release format.,1364515200,11,725,4.231884057971015
4385694,1,B004IB04MQ,"If you love Bob Hope, or have a morbid fascination with typical mediocre movies of the period, you'll enjoy this collection, because they depend on Bob Hope, rather than a good script.  Further, as others have noted, these movies were not remastered.  If you can find the collection for $10, it would be worth buying, but not for more than that.",1327276800,2,345,4.639344262295082
4385695,4,B004IB04MQ,"Volume 2 is an even wider mix of Bob Hope comedies in one package. Most of these have been previously released; even less spectacular is the prints have been untouched (""The Great Lover"" is still dark & scratchy, while ""Paris Holiday"" retains its splash-colored Technirama).
Why 4 stars instead of 5? Depending on what you like, this volume really shows the difference between Hope at the top of his game, and Hope when he should've called it quits years earlier.
""The Great Lover"" (1949) is the earliest offering, showing Hope in fine wisecracking-cowardly-womanizing form as a scoutmaster leading his troupe through Europe (via luxury liner) while crossing paths with a charming murderer & lovely Rhonda Fleming (look for a hilarious cameo from Jack Benny). ""Son of Paleface"" (1952) is one of my personal faves. A zany sequel to the 1948 original, Hope plays the Harvard-educated ""idiot son"" of Painless Potter who returns west to inherit his Daddy's fortune while fending off town creditors hungry to get paid off. En route, he gets mixed up with a tough gang leader (darkly gorgeous Jane Russell as ""The Torch"") and the federal agent (Roy Rogers, along with Trigger, the horse who easily outwits Hope) tracking her. Helmed by former Looney Toons animator Frank Tashlin (which explains why he has a real eye for wild sight gags), Hope couldn't have been in better hands. Hope proves here that he's become a masterful visual comedian as well as a verbal one at this point, and the movie dares you not to laugh all the way through it. ""Paris Holiday"" (1958) is an extremely pleasing comedy, pairing Hope with blond beauty Anita Ekberg, and teaming him with French comedian Ferndandel with surprisingly amusing results. As an actor traveling through Europe who gets embroiled in international intrigue, it has pleasing echoes of Hope comedies past. A carnival, a mental institution, a trial, and a kooky helicopter ride are some of the highlights.
Now going downhill...
It was clear that Hope did his best film work in the 40's & 50's, with a few nice surprises in the 60's. Not that Hope wasn't funny in the 60's; his trademark quips & one-liners could still get laughs. But he never looked more out of place--and out of step--with the times than here, saddled with embarrassingly lousy scripts. ""The Private Navy of Sgt. O'Farrell"" (1968) is probably the best offering, a loose-limbed, wacky WWII comedy reuniting Hope with director Frank Tashlin. No classic, to be sure, at least the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, as it contains a funny spoof of ""From Here to Eternity""...and wild-haired comic foil Phyllis Diller. ""How to Commit Marriage"" (1969) ""pits""--rather than ""teams""--Hope against Jackie Gleason in this dated comedy about love, divorce, morals & the generation gap. The movie comes alive in scenes when Hope & Gleason square off toe-to-toe, but the rest of the movie is a letdown, disappointing fans of two comedy greats. ""Cancel My Reservation"" (1972) is even further off the target (you hear a funky 70's soundtrack & wonder what Hope is doing in this one). As a vacationing TV talk show personality framed for murder in Arizona (there's also a plot to swindle Native Americans out of land), the story allows little opportunity for comedy. It seems more like an episode from a TV crime show than a Hope comedy.
Again, this volume certainly has its highs & lows. But it's really up to the viewer to decide what's great, and what's not.",1317254400,15,3459,4.914529914529915

4385697,3,B004IB04MQ,I find it harder and harder to accept that in an age of hi-def blu-ray and 3D television we still get older films released on DVD that do not present the entire image as filmed by the director.  The pan-and-scan versions of Bob's widescreen films on this set are simply unacceptable.  If proper elements were lacking after a thorough search of the (Paramount?) vaults and elsewhere then we should have been duly notified in the package.  As it is I find this set no better than the old public domain versions that float around.  I applaud Shout! for recognizing a market for Bob Hope films on DVD; I chastise them for not taking us seriously by giving us crappy versions.  We're not all old codgers who don't know the difference between P&S and widescreen and don't know when they're being ripped off.  I'll gladly pay more for the next set if that's what it takes for them to do it right.,1309910400,33,889,4.490683229813665
