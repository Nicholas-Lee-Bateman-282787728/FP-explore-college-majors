4654912,5,B005CXOG6O,"For Cardinals fans still floating on cloud nine after St Louis polished off the Texas Rangers in Game Seven of the 2011 World Series, this marvelously crafted film recounting the most improbable championship season in franchise history should keep the euphoria at a fever pitch through the long off-season, and beyond.

Certainly, the historical significance of what the Cardinals accomplished in 2011 is astounding - from the wild finish to the regular season which got them the Wild Card berth in Game 162 - to the shocking five game triumph over the Phillies in the NLDS (Carpenter's Game Five masterpiece is included as a bonus) - to the incredible offensive display in the six game whipping of the Brewers in the NLCS - and finally, to the thrilling showdown against Texas which culminated in the Cardinals' eleventh World Series championship, overall.

This was indeed a magical championship run for the Redbirds; here's a great way to relive the magic, with the St Louis Cardinals 2011 Official World Series Championship Film.  It's a definite winner!",1322092800,12,1058,5.068965517241379
4654913,5,B005CXOG6O,"I just got a copy of the 2011 Official World Series Film and it is awsome!  Hearing the reactions from the guys to the various pivotal moments of the Fall Classic made them all the more special.  I love the way all the key points of the season were highlighted - the loss of Wainwright, the early woes of the bullpen, the Pujols injury, the Rasmus Trade, the ascent to the Wild Card - everything.

There is also a bonus disc featuring Game Five of the NLDS against the Phillies - possibly the gutsiest Chris Carpenter performance ever - in its entirety.

I also liked the fact that most of the game audio was taken from Mike Shannon and John Rooney on KMOX.  Much better than hearing those sniveling Yankee and Red Sox appologists on FOX.

I loved how each game was encapsulated, especially the dramatic fashion in which the stage was set for Games Six and Seven.

One thing I had a problem with was the narration.  While I do think that Jon Hamm did a good job, I would much rather that Billy Bob Thornton (who narrated the 2006 Official World Series Film) had been the narrator.

I think captions would have been a plus, but, otherwise, in terms of content, it blows the 2006 World Series Film away.",1321920000,55,1201,4.398190045248869
4654914,1,B005CXOG6O,"It appears from everywhere I've searched online for the DVD details - there may be NO subtitles or captions on this DVD.  That was the case on the 2006 DVD and I'm disappointed that 5 years later that may continue to be the case despite technology advances and updated ADA laws.

I am deaf and rely on subtitles/captions for my viewing - how can I enjoy recapping the Cardinals world championship without those??",1321833600,20,412,4.63013698630137

Watching the film helps me remember all the joy that was apparent in Cardinal Nation that year. I have watched it at least 6 times.

4654947,5,B005CXOG6O,To be honest I thought about giving this a four but whenever a championship is won by my favorite team I am just happy to have this DVD in existence.  I just did not feel that this film was long enough and that it did not offer as many features as the 2006 film.

4654967,5,B005CXOG6O,"I really enjoy this. The presentation is great.

4654968,5,B005CXOG6O,The DVD showed all the high lights. Game 6 was the best the people where tenis in the game. When the final home was hit it was hard to describe but was great.,1330300800,,158,3.8181818181818183
4654969,5,B005CXOG6O,"The Fall Classic brings out the best of this beautiful game. For me, as a fan of the sport, it makes no real difference who plays, I try to watch as many games as I can, regular, exhibition, all star, playoffs. I watched the Angels ascending, Red Sox break their curse, the Fish stylin' all over, the Fear the Beard gimmick etc. There's something else when you watch ""your"" team, I've also watched how the Tigers collapsed, and now this. Maybe it's just that this season's ups and downs synced with the ups and downs I had last year and the comeback and never-say-die are the key motives in this picture. You can feel the roller coaster before every game, during every game, and after every game, in a spectacular culmination when Freese unleashed it, making one final statement that you should never give up.

But the story doesn't end here. Once you relive the season and see the celebrations and parades (which at that point seemed a bit overwhelming for me living overseas), you get to relive that epic game. Carpenter and Halladay. Close friends. Fierce competitors. Yeah you know the score and yeah you know that in the end it was Ryan Howard who choked at another season on the line moment. But it's games like those that makes everyone tip their hat and salute this majestic game. And you can see it, inning by inning, pitch by pitch.

I think one should definitely try and watch this. It doesn't matter which team you support, if you like the game.",1328832000,,1457,4.557251908396947
4654970,5,B005CXOG6O,This is the best DVD in our set of Sport's DVD's. I recommend this to anyone who loves baseball and Game 6 of the WS was the best ever. Go Cards in 2012!,1328659200,,153,3.6666666666666665

4654978,3,B005CXOG6O,Great blu ray picture on this.  I'm not sure why game 6 of the world series was not included in its entirety.  Instead Game 5 of Philadelphia Series is there. That game is great but no runs are scored the last 8 innings so it doesn't quite have the appeal for repeated viewings. I guess they kept game 6 for the more expensive Collectors edition.,1326412800,,346,4.3076923076923075

The insight, the camera angles, the in-games remarks by Nick Punto make this a DVD for all baseball fans. This was one of the best World Series ever played. Proving once again, it isn't always about New York, Boston, etc.., I'd say Chicago, but we already know about 1908.

4654996,5,B005CXOG6O,"I counted the days for this film, knowing that the producers had in this years World Series winner, the stuff of legend. One improbable comeback after another. The St Louis Cardinals eventual triumph in 2011 was one for the ages. Nothing is overlooked here, not one single key element of the story is forgotten. I can't stop watching it, it should win an Oscar, but it won't bring Albert back. A must for the entire population of Cardinal Nation. 10/10.",1324857600,,453,4.675

4654998,5,B005CXOG6O,"In a word, Epic! Started with the pre season drama of Pujols moving into free agency and Wainright being out for the year with an elbow injury, dealt with the drama of slumping players at the start of the regular season, to the post All Star break and our wild race to the post season with the Cardinal's win and the Brave's loss. Then detailed reviews of every post season experience, especially detailed with each of the 7 games of the world series. This movie showed the comeback spirit and the never give up spirit of the Cardinal's baseball organization. A must have for any real fan!",1324684800,,589,4.514018691588785
4654999,4,B005CXOG6O,I have purchased every WS video since 1996 and am rarely disappointed.  The 2011 World Series ranks up with the most exciting I ever saw and Game 6 was the most exciting game I have ever watched in all the years I have been watching baseball!  The video itself has a new narrator that is not as good as in years past (hence I didn't give it the full five stars) but some of the extras are novel.  There is a second DVD included with the National League clinching game.  The bonus fearures have David Frees' walkoff 6th game homerun repeated 5 times with different announcers including international announcers.  The postgame interview with Lance Berkman and Frees was priceless.  Frees talks about growing up and watching a walk-off homerun in St. Louis' 2004 playoffs not realizing that Berkman played in the game for the Astros.  This drew a nice chuckle.,1323993600,2,857,4.673333333333333
4655000,3,B005CXOG6O,"I am a lifelong Cardinals fan and this season offered perhaps my favorite all-time ""rooting"" experience. I am therefore happy to have this DVD. It brought back a good deal of that joyful feeling I experienced throughout the playoffs. But I cannot help but say that it could have been so much better. It is just an ""okay"" effort. Game 6 of the World Series is perhaps the best example. The lead up to the game tying hits in the 9th and 10th innings was insufficient. The drama was not built, and boy was there drama. That is true of much else as well: wasted opportunities. But the story is such a good one, so compelling and emotional, that even this modest effort is worth the cost.

Also as others have said - it is difficult to explain the choice of game 5 of the Phillies series over Game 6 of the World Series if you can only include one full game.",1323302400,2,853,4.265432098765432
4655001,5,B005CXOG6O,"Living in St. Louis and being a Cardinal fan all my life, I didn't think any DVD could do the Card's 2011 season justice.  But, I couldn't pass up the chance to check it out.
This DVD showed so many things than in the ""heat of the moment"" a lot of us Cardinals fans didn't see in real time.  The camera angles are the best I have ever seen.  At one point you could actually see the expression on Yadi's face moments before he threw out a runner. Amazing.  The interviews were great.  This DVD also showed many parts of the stadium that an average fan doesn't see.  Kudos to all of those who worked so hard to get this out in such a short length of time.  It was a great look back at one of the most amazing finishes in baseball history.  Well done.",1322956800,6,748,4.075342465753424
4655002,3,B005CXOG6O,"This is a 2 DVD set where the first disk, in lightning speed, goes over brief parts of the St. Louis Cardinals regular season and playoffs, and then each game of the World Series.  The second disk is worth the price alone, containing game 5 of the NLDS, considered to be one of the most decisive 1-0 games in baseball history.

The length of the first disc is about an hour.  The editing is poor, jumping around in time, sometimes in flashes, making it confusing to watch.  If you don't pay attention, you could lose your place.  And be ready with the pause button, because if any text appears on the screen (a record being broken for example), you won't have time to read it.  I got a much better feel for what it was trying to do after going thru it a second time.

Bonus features included the following:

This Week in Baseball:  Lance Berkman
Prime 9:  Tony LaRussa
NL Wild Card Clinch (Short snip of locker room celebration, no interviews)
Game 5 NLDS:  Last out
Game 6 NLCS:  Last out
Game 3 World Series:  Pujols' 3 home runs
Game 6 World Series:  Freese's triple to tie
Game 6 World Series:  Berkman's single to tie
Game 6 World Series:  Berkman/Freese press conference
Game 6 World Series:  Freese's Walk off home run.
Game 7 World Series:  Freese's double to tie
Game 7 World Series:  Last out.

Sound options are:

2.0 Stereo
Dolby Digital
5.1 Surround sound (not Dolby)

There is, I'm afraid, no closed captioning option.

All of the bonus features worth watching have more time devoted to them while viewing the regular disk footage, except the game 6 walk off home run by Freese which is broadcast four times, using both sets of the USA announcers, a British announcer and a Spanish announcer in Spanish.  Some others are just a few seconds long.

This is not really a ""World Series Film"".  Disk one is a film for St. Louis Cardinal fans and fans of baseball who are St. Louis Cardinal fans.  I would have shown more about both teams rather than just the St. Louis Cardinals, especially about how each team was structured in offense, defense and pitching.  In the editing, I would have finished one thing before I showed the next.  But as a bonus feature, I would have spent some appropriate time showing how the Cardinals, a team with a typical troubled season poised for a meltdown, won 33 of their last 50 regular and post season games to become world champions.  A remarkable comeback that happens in baseball, but only rarely.  It shows that anything can happen in baseball which is the beauty of the sport.  In baseball, appearances often times cannot predict an outcome.

In the end, the seven game contest was between two virtually evenly matched teams, each in their own way.  An upstart pesky team who came up against a virtual bulldog of a team, and won, as one announcer put it, ""...they just...won't...go...away.

Even more notable is a second story of a team who accomplished all this with one pitcher, and a bunch of other guys whom thru management and their own efforts would become pitchers.

But the gem of the two disks is the second one.  A pitching duel, with selectable half innings, pitting best friends and former teammates Chris Carpenter and Roy Halladay against each other showing the complete fifth game of the NLDS.  For those who would like to have a classic pitching duel of their own in their living room with two Cy Young Award pitchers at the helm, buy this set and throw away the first disk.",1322697600,21,3439,4.577049180327869
4655003,4,B005CXOG6O,"Sorry, but anyone labeling Joe Buck and Tim McCarver as Yankee and Red Sox apologists need to rethink their viewpoints. You may not care for their commentary - although I personally believe they're two of the very best in the business - but an ""anti-Cardinal bias""? Say what? Anyone even mildly knowledgeable about the organization knows that they are both about as deeply rooted in St. Louis and Redbird history as one could imagine.

More importantly, I'm excited about receiving the blu-ray edition of this release, and was pleased to read that the NLCS Game 5 is included as a bonus. Great game, brilliant and gutsy performance by Carpenter. But Game 5 rather than the Series Game 6? WHAT WERE THEY SMOKING!!?? How many commentators, both baseball experts and mere civilians alike, almost universally proclaimed Game 6 as perhaps the greatest game in World Series history. What a missed opportunity. Mindboggling ...

I'm assuming this will be a terrific treasure for Cardinal fans, and well deserving of a high rating. The deducted star is for the glaring absence of Game 6.",1322265600,4,1079,4.955801104972376
