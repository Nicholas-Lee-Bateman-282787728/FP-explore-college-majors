The person who sold me the movie should have known that region 2 DVDs do not at here in Canada instead of going she's and selling it to me in the first place.

I paid close to $30 for it",1441152000,2,367,3.5185185185185186
8242185,5,B0011S7BKM,"Marvellous from the very start to the end of suspense and suspicion as to how things work out, The plot is welcoming and with the performances from the cast as the storyline is fabulous. A woman and man create a baby and than the baby disappears from the care of her mother while the father is away, The mother of the baby being a bit challenged with her ways that her mum steps in to help guide her along and with the detective who isn't to sure of it all. The  police are convinced she is lying, the only way out is for her to find her daughter and prove them all wrong. Problem is that she must go interstate and kidnap her baby and bring her home without being caught by the police in that state. But she must make her first step by herself and alone without help from anyone else as there hands are tied. I rated this an A grade plus for the cast and storyline that produced this movie with such feelings and emotions that you can't help feeling the way you do after seeing this, you too will experience the same reaction I did. So now it's time for the curtain to go up and with popcorn in hand feet up relaxing to a fantastic night in with fabulous entertainment.  Enjoy!",1433548800,,1178,4.185022026431718
