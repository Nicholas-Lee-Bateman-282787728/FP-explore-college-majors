8471350,3,B005G815ZU,I had seen this on televison on Lidia's cooking show on Create TV and I thought it was cute.  There is cooking and her mother and grandchildren cook with her as she explains the Italian treats she grew up eating at Chrismas.  There are cure animated sections showing Lidia as a child and their family traditions while she was in Italy and it even includes a cute song that Lidia sings.,1367712000,,385,4.408450704225352
8471351,4,B005G815ZU,"This is the second Lidia DVD from PBS that I've reviewed in as many years.

If you are a regular viewer of ""Lidia's Kitchen"" on PBS, and have young children (say, 7 to 11) this Christmas DVD may be up your alley. Based on the picture book of the same name, it combines a story (how Lidia and her brother Franco) celebrated Christmas as children in both live and animated versions. It incorporates two ""recipes"" for making cookies  both baked and fried). You can't follow the demonstration because most steps are skipped (but the video sends you to Lidia's web site for the ingredients and directions.

Along the way there are two new songs sung by Lidia and her 5 ""grandchildren"" and her mother. You don't find out until the credits roll at the end that - other than the Lidia - the kids are all actors! There's a short ""Kitchen Tip"" added at the end where she shows one of the boys (again, not Lidia's real grandson) how to separate an egg.

My guess is that this will appeal mostly to Lidia's legion of fans - who will want to share it with their children or grandchildren.
