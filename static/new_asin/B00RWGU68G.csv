8696117,4,B00RWGU68G,"Note: This review is for ""Eternity And a Day"" by the great Greek film-maker Theo Angelopoulos.  That's the film pictured here (look closely at the image).  I have no idea why Amazon has this listed as directed by Ole Bornedal. So, buyer beware something is off - the picture or the listing.

The most Bergmanesque of Angolopoulos's films. Simpler and less epic than most of his work, with fewer of his trademark breathtaking images and grand themes. Yet this story of a dying writer spending his last day before entering the hospital -- never to leave -- has a deeply elegiac melancholy, and his attempts to find meaning by saving an Albanian street urchin are often moving, if occasionally sappy. The same is true of Bruno Ganz' (unfortunately dubbed) relationship with his wife and family, told mainly in flashback. Much is moving, some is hokey and forced. But Ageloupolus' use of images to make film a poetic medium is always worth watching, even when flawed.

The Greek 'New Star' disc, only available a short while, was supervised by Angelopoulos, and is an improvement over the other available discs.",1439078400,,1107,4.872340425531915
