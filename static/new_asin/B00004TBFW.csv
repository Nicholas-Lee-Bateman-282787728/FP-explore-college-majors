7922410,5,B00004TBFW,"I really cannot remember where I saw this movie...maybe TV or something, but I doubt it made it into theaters :)
Staci Keanan from ""Step-by-Step"" was in this movie, and i am pretty sure that is why i remember it.  The character ""Willie"" is just too dumb to forget...the scene with cleaning the toilet made me cringe so hard.

Enjoy",1346716800,,331,4.5
7922411,5,B00004TBFW,"Downhill Willie could possibly be the most underrated film of the last 25 years if not longer.  The fact that this costs only $10 and has no reviews is ridiculous.

In short, SEE THIS MOVIE!!! It is absolutely hysterical and will have you reciting lines years from now.

Brilliant acting, amazing script, action-packed... it really doesn't get much better.

Enjoy.",1334275200,,364,5.016666666666667
7922412,4,B00004TBFW,"Low production values, check.
Inane script, check.
Over-the-top acting, check.

And Canadian!

Everything that should work against this film instead works for it.
This movie is always good for a giggle.  One of my favorites, and I'm glad I was able to buy it as soon as I wanted it - I get the feeling there will be lots of disappointed Willie fans when the available copies vanish.

Go Willie Go",1248048000,,396,4.535211267605634
