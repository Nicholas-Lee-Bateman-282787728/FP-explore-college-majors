8219077,4,B000VKJ6YK,"This volume of Xenosaga the Animation is very nicely done. The I loved the story as much as the first volume, even though it moved a little slower, and took more time explaining things in episode 5.

The first two episodes (on this volume) introduce a very important character, Jr, much better than episode 4 did. And most of the men in the show getting drunk and Allen, Shion's assistant chief, was hilarious!

Parts of Episode 7 are my only *minor* complaint (why this volume got 4 out of 5 for me). it is a very goofy episode, making fun of the video game's tech attacks and all. But it is funny to see MOMO in her ""attack"" (Sailor Moon, anyone?) and many parts are truly funny, as poorly animated the fight scene is. And the ""explination"" of the Encephelon is totally off; there is nothing about the imagination that creates the Encephelon, it's all about the diver's memories of places they have already been. Episode 8 explains it much better.

Episode 8 is definately the best of this volume. It is much darker than anything in the series yet, and much bloodier as well. I found it a tiny bit gory, but excelent! I won't spoil anything, but this is the most intense episode so far!

This is definatelty worth buying! It's funny and dark and has a touch of ""Law and Order"" stylings in the middle.
I definately reccomend it!",1195257600,,1329,4.479338842975206
