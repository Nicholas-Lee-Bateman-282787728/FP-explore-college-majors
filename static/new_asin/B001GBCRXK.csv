Each disc seems to have 3 episodes on it...these are all part of the ""Takeout Collection"" which may have been a discontinued series of the multitude of shows they have combined on disc over the years. This is NOT a season by season collection. Copyright on these show 2003 & 2004...obviously anything created since then would not be on these...but allas they are great shows!",1250812800,19,690,4.838983050847458
8304721,5,B001GBCRXK,"I love Alton Brown's Good Eats and this is a good compilation of his shows. I am trying to collect them all, a daunting task, but this helped me a great deal. I love it!",1245801600,,169,3.857142857142857
8304722,5,B001GBCRXK,"I got this set at an absolutely awesome price from Amazon seller ""purpleturtleproducts"", and my boyfriend was more than excited!  He'd hoped to get a couple of Alton's dvds for Christmas, but I surprised him with a box full of them!  I will be buying some AB dvds for my sister as well - he's helped me tremendously in the kitchen, I burn things less and less every day :)

If you're reading this and have never seen Alton Brown, go to FoodNetwork.com or YouTube and search for his episodes and you'll see what I mean.  He's like Bill Nye for food!  AB doesn't just show you a few recipes - he teaches you exactly why you use each and every ingredient so you can learn to make your own informed decisions in the kitchen!",1244419200,2,720,4.303703703703704
8304723,5,B001GBCRXK,"Alton Brown has effectively become my all time hero - what we have here is an anthology of one of the best written, best produced, best photographed and most imaginitive television shows ever to hit the small screen. When I first saw an episode on TV, I thought ""you've got to be kidding. Where did they dig this guy up from? Next!!"" But then up popped a guy wearing a vegetable suit, Alton smiled into an ultrawide lens in a remarkable Hansel and Gretel set, rolled his eyes and I was hooked. Heir to the Fat Ladies and I think, meant for the same crowd.

Alton Brown is a genius. I don't use this word lightly, either. Like his style or not, the show is informative, filled with sophisticated humor, and above all fun. And there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING that even the most discriminating parent of any faith at all will find they have to be wary of when the kids plop the DVD into the tray and watch. And they WILL watch and enjoy!

Do yourself a favor. Buy this set or a whack of his DVD's, and watch and smile. The mood you'll be transported into will last for hours! And make no mistake. The production values of this show are very, very high. Exquisite in fact. Perhaps the best small scale studio photography I've seen.

Oh yeah. I almost forgot. The enclosed recipes from each show in the DVD booklet really work, not like many of the recipes from food show gurus. You can rely on these to look good, taste good and be easy to prepare.

Bravo Alton Brown!

AS A BIG PS - I warn you that this is NOT a DVD set per se, but a randomly selected collection of dvd's that arrived at my home wrapped singly in a big box.

It is my guess that the distributer had a bunch left over from a run and put them together in a group to sell.

All of these dvd's are available singly, and as a matter of fact, I have augmented my ""set"" by purchasing a few later on that I didn't have.

No matter, it's the same program and the same company, and any Alton Brown dvd is worth the purchase.",1239494400,15,1975,4.192612137203167

8304725,5,B001GBCRXK,"This DVD set is filled with some really Great Episodes. I'm a BIG fan of Good Eats and am collecting the series. Of course your not going to want to cook everything he does, but the knowledge is incredible.  Also each DVD comes with a little recipe booklet... its great to refer back to if you don't have tme to search through the entire DVD... Also I haven't found any set that had so many DVDs at such a great price... BUY IT!!!",1237334400,12,430,4.180722891566265
