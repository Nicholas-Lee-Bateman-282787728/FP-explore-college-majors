5679992,3,B00BX8A92C,"Cheesy formula movies and Presley went hand in hand, that's why he did not sign any further movie deals after 1969. This film is no different however the music is mostly upbeat, fast paced and plenty. Presley actually never even stepped foot in Mexico his scenes were shot in the US but the story plot is adequate and the child actor who plays his sidekick performed like a champ.",1477180800,,380,4.521739130434782

5679999,3,B00BX8A92C,"Released in 1963, Fun in Acapulco stars Elvis Presley as a lifeguard/singer at a ritzy Mexican resort who stirs the interest of two women and rivalry of a Mexican diver. As with most of Elvis movies, he sings a song every 7-12 minutes.

While the story takes place in Acapulco and a lot of scenes were shot at a resort there, Elvis never set foot in Mexico during filming, presumably due to his busy schedule. This becomes clear as you watch the movie: Several cast members clearly shot some scenes at the actual resort (Ursula Andress, Elsa Crdenas and Alejandro Rey), but whenever interaction with Elvis is required, out comes the rear-projection. Some good examples include Presleys bike ride with the Mexican kid, Elvis & Ursula along the street and every shot with Elvis and another character sitting or standing near a wall overlooking the ocean. The film is such a lark and rear-projection was so prevalent back then that the movie works in spite of this, but it was definitely noticeable and therefore excessive.

As far as the women go, forget Marguerita (Andress) and Delores (Crdenas) (as fine as they are), I'll take Janie (Teri Hope), the petite blond on the boat at the beginning. She had the requisite curves.

The film runs 97 minutes.

5680014,4,B00BX8A92C,I recently watched Fun in Acapulco for the first time since its original release in 1963. I must admit I enjoyed it far more than I did as a teenager. Perhaps my expectations were too high more than fifty years ago. Elvis's performance of Bossa Nova Baby alone is worth the price of the DVD.,1424131200,,291,4.3090909090909095

5680016,1,B00BX8A92C,"Great movie with beautiful scenery that you will want to watch over and over again.  Raul, the homeless Mexican child whose character is almost as big as Elvis in the movie, is the manager of Mike Wingrin (Elvis), booking him singing jobs when Mike is down on his luck.

This is the only reason I gave this movie any stars.  The disc. I received is the ""wide screen"" version, which is horrible.  Too much of the picture is cut off from the top of the screen and from the bottom of the screen.  If you have Video On Demand and have Fun In Acapulco in the full screen version, you find many details showing that the widescreen version does not show.  heads are cut off, images in the wide screen that seemingly cut off the character at the waist, show their legs down to the knees in the full-screen version.  I thought the aspect ration of 1:33.1 would be closest to the full screen version, but upon getting my disc and finding that one of the ""special features"" was the wide-screen version, i regretted getting this disc.",1423353600,,1022,4.433155080213904

5680022,4,B00BX8A92C,"Everyone knows that nearly all of Elvis's movies were pretty bad. This one, however, actually has a somewhat believable story. And it has charming qualities that others did not--an engaging child character as Elvis's sidekick, Ursula Andress, fresh from her Bond experience, and beautiful scenery in Mexico. A plus is the Latin-themed music, which seems to work well for Elvis, who of course is in great voice. A fun movie!",1410825600,4,423,5.057142857142857
