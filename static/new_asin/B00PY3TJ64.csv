8689753,3,B00PY3TJ64,"It's really just a Spanish version of a True Detective style mystery without much mystery and minimal thrills. The performances are terrific and it looks good, with the bleached out cinematography, which now seems all directors must use for films of this nature - but to fully appreciate the subtext, it helps to have some knowledge of Spanish politics. I thought it was very ordinary.",1455408000,,385,4.938461538461539
8689754,5,B00PY3TJ64,"Superb film - the monotony of detective work punctuated by moments of edgy suspense, and a few interesting subplots thrown in, all against the backdrop of a poor Spanish region in the transitional time frame to democracy.",1449964800,,221,5.0
8689755,5,B00PY3TJ64,"Set in 1980 in the deep south of Spain; Franco has been replaced by a democratic government but some of the problems with that era are still around like nasty hangovers  one is the questionable policing tactics. Enter two cops, one is the obviously good one and the other is apparently bad (worked for Franco)  this is Juan and Pedro.

They have been sent to a rural backwater to investigate the disappearance of two sisters. What they uncover is that a serial killer has been taking young girls for some time and nothing has been done to stop it or even link the dots. Despite the two cops being diametrically opposed ideologically they form an alliance and go out to get the killer.

Now this is a rather exceptional film, some of the aerial shots  that are stunning- were digitized from original photographs of Andaluca by Atn Aya. The cinematography is superb and acts to stylishly bookend certain parts of the film. The period detail is spot on  even the fashion  with flares you could trap a flock of seagulls in (another eighties reference!) are great.

Original title is La Isla Minima and you may recognise Jesus Castro from El Nino but most of the actors are all relatively unknown. Despite that this is an excellent production. It has all the tension and gritty realism wrapped up in an Arthouse presentation that has positioned itself in the realm of a period crime drama. I absolutely loved it, I was almost slack jawed enrapt at times and felt a pang of disappointment when it was over  this is an easy one to highly recommend.",1445644800,2,1541,4.615384615384615
