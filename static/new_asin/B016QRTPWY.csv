8737135,3,B016QRTPWY,Decent coverage for a year-end review.  Some good shots of gnarly terrain.  Maybe too many podium shots.  Overall a pretty good video.,1481932800,,134,5.0

8737137,4,B016QRTPWY,"Need to slow down the narration and maybe focus a bit more - it speeds by so fast. However, it's awesome to see all the races in any format. Really enjoyed this and the 2009 version that came out.",1468627200,,196,4.051282051282051
