1668676,4,B00005UW9V,This is slightly different from the traditional King Arthur and the knights of the round table.  Most of the action takes place in today's world.  It is whimsical and funny. Adrain Paul plays a different kind of Lancelot,1011744000,5,220,4.7631578947368425

Following the Arthurian tradition a long while, I found nothing that gave any credible extension of prior art. I hate myself for suffering through the last half with little reward received for my effort. Adrian Paul must have been offered a sequel in order to sign on to the ""effort"".

I watched a few minutes, skipped forward several times to see if it got better.  But that didn't happen, so I stopped the show.  I probably wasted 20 to 30 minutes so it's not like I didn't give it a chance.
It seems to be common for Amazon to put these B or C movies on their prime list.  I don't use prime a lot because it is so limited.  Slow to get it going, and it seems like the bandwidth starts out fine, but soon becomes less than what is needed to actually watch it.",1454112000,2,589,4.0344827586206895

Possibly worth a one-watch when you're in bed and trying to fall asleep, otherwise it wasn't great. That being said, it wasn't horrible either.

One or more reviewers seemed to think this was a sequel to another movie called Merlin. Well, i hate to pop your bubble, but it is most likely NO relation to its namesake! Merlin is a legendary figure who has had many a movie and book written about him, probably all or mostly fictional. Ridiculous Sci-fi and other liberties have definitely been taken in this takeoff.

1668865,1,B00005UW9V,"I have seen a number of movies in my lifetime about Arthur and his  Knights of the Round Table.  This one would be in my bottom three.

It had some good moments, but the bad sequences went on for ever (seems like 1500 years).  They could have done a great movie with a better script and special effects.  The acting was sad.  I have seen better acting in elementary school plays.

Craig Sheffer's acting talents were never utilized in playing Mordred.  Patrick Bergin's Arthur was more like a court jester than the boy who drew the sword from the stone to become the great king of legends.  Guinevere and Lancelot were bit players in a bad production.  The tragedy of their illicit love caused the fall of Camelot aided by Morgana was captured a bit by this movie.

The two children, Kate and Ritchie, had some good moments, especially when they helped Merlin in the laboratory of Joan Maxwell who was never called Doctor Maxwell, but Miss Maxwell unless I missed it. There was an opportunity with Joan Maxwell to explore why she wanted to free Mordred.  She wanted the freedom to do her research without interference.  Too many times scientists become pawns of the powerful.  This would have been a good theme to explore, but it was left as a passing comment.  Unfortunately, too many great themes were left on the floor in this movie.

 One of these themes was that Guinevere still loved Arthur.  After spending 1500 years with Lancelot, she realized that a piece of shining armour is not always a comfort in another dimension.

When Guinevere gave Kate her wedding ring, this was another opportunity since Ritchie was knighted by Arthur that he and Kate would carry on the legacy of Arthur under Merlin's tutorage.  This is definitely implied, but the theme could have been expanded.

One star may seem harsh to those who love this movie, but given the context of the Arthurian vault of movies in existence, this is why one star was given.",1204070400,9,1942,4.652941176470589

The dialoue is so ridiculous there where tears in my eyes from laughing so hard.  My favriote scene has to be where king arthur and is men charge a semi truck .  Also when lancalote and merlin go for a ride on a water slide in a cavern is also pretty damn funny.  So kuddos to the director and writer for making the worst movie of all time.

1668870,3,B00005UW9V,"Written and directed by Paul Matthews and brought believably to life by a terrific cast of performers, Merlin the Return is a surprisingly fun movie for Arthurian buffs, dreamers, and kids of all ages.  In this story the reports of King Arthur's (Patrick Bergin) death at the hands of Mordred (Craig Sheffer)have been greatly exaggerated.  In fact, Merlin the Magician (Rik Mayall) was able to stave off Arthur's defeat by magically throwing Mordred and his army into a dimension of eternal darkness, while at the same moment placing Arthur and his knights into suspended animation to await the day of final reckoning.  Now, thanks to the machinations of an overly ambitious scientist named Maxwell (Tia Carrere), that day is at hand.  As Maxwell prepares to use Earth's magnetic energies to break open Mordred's otherworldly prison and unleash hell on earth, the awakened King Arthur must steal back Excalibur from Mordred before all is lost...and only the traitorous (?) Sir Lancelot (Adrian Paul) can help him.
Aimed primarily at kids, this movie may not be high art but it is entertaining, particularly for those of us who are always hunting for a fresh look at the Arthurian myth.  The film mixes action and comedy quite efficiently, and the sight of King Arthur and his knights attacking a lumbering semi (quoth Arthur:  ""Yon beast is big, but slow!"")is a moment of absurd genius.  While the SFX are not lavish, they are good enough, and the sorcerous duels between Merlin and Mordred are spectacular in their own way. Also, the scenes of Mordred's ghostly agents possessing local townspeople are genuinely scary--and perhaps a reason why only fairly mature kids should see this particular movie.
But the actors make this movie.  Bergin is a stalwart Arthur, Carrere is ravishing (which hardly goes unnoticed by Sir Gawain!), and Paul is a more than believable Lancelot (here more repentant than usual).  Sheffer does go a bit over the top as archvillain Mordred, but he makes a manacing antagonist all the same.
No, this is not Excalibur; but it wasn't meant to be.  It is good escapist fun, and sometimes that's good enough.",1022544000,77,2132,4.963483146067416
1668871,3,B00005UW9V,"This is a rather amusing take on Merlin - Rik Mayall plays an affable but rather bumbling Merlin, who lives in modern-day England - and has to awaken a Hibernating Arthur and company to battle Mordred, who is trying to break free from a magical prison.  The flick is produced well enough, but in watching it, I get the feeling that it's culled together from selected clips from a TV series or some such - end result being that I feel like I've witnessed an 'insider joke' - it's amusing overall, but you just don't have the whole story.  I'm also taking away a star for the producers not being able to find anything for Adrian Paul to do, other that the expected gratuitous swordfight or two.  Points off for Typecasting.  All in all though, there's worse ways to drop ten bucks...",1020124800,20,781,4.47887323943662
7955478,1,B00005UW9V,Sorry the premise of the storyline is awful.  I despise making a favorite storytelling a bafoon one. Portraying Merlin as an idiotic and defenseless Wizard is plain wrong. All Wizards are great and powerful.  I despise seeing Guinevere portrayed as a hapless maiden...this move sucks so bad.  I couldn't finish watching it.,1506556800,,323,5.173076923076923

7955481,2,B00005UW9V,"Two spunky kids save the day.  People with a couple of decades of movie viewing will immediately recognize the formula for clich and blandness.  The Arthurian legend took its modern form with Sir Thomas Malorys LeMorte d'Arthur, said to have been completed in 1469 or 1470, then revised and printed by William Caxton in 1485.  Over the centuries it has been the inspiration for numerous excellent literary and theatrical works.  Merlin, the Return is definitely not one of them.  Best suited for children, and not the brightest ones at that.",1503187200,,541,4.966666666666667

King Arthur and Merlin and magic mixed with modern science fiction and of course the kids are the heroes who save the world from evil. Light fun for adults looking for a little silliness. Adrian Paul is Lancelot and the script borrows a few tongue in cheek lines from the Highlander TV series.",1501891200,,350,4.318181818181818
