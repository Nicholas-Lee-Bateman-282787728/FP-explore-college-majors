To create the 1.78 aspect ratio, the movie was NOT CROPPED.  Instead, incredibly, new animation was added, frame by frame, to extend the frame to the sides to create the new frame shape.  In addition, a meticulous digital restoration was performed by Tom Burton's team at Technicolor.  Finally, there is no room for a review that does not include watching the piece being reviewed!",1384041600,2,528,4.887640449438202
7900733,1,7887632412,"Wan Laiming's ""Uproar in Heaven"" is one of the great classics of world animation. I won't bother you with repeating the storyline of this masterpiece released shortly before the Chinese Cultural Revolution took place. But I would like to concentrate on this new Bluray editon containing the 2D and a new 3D version. First I have to admit that I haven't watched the Bluray but I read some enthusiastic articles about it and saw some clips. Personally I own the 40th Anniversary 2-DVD-set, the Taiwanese subtitled version and the French DVD. The Bluray version has a running time of 93 min and an aspect ratio of 1.78:1. The soundtrack has been changed by mixing a symphonic score to the Peking opera like original music and the 3D version also features new voice dubbing.

From the point of view of a film purist this Bluray is an obvious attempt to match the viewing habits of today's technology oriented generation. Nobody wants to see a silent movie or a b/W film. So you have to colorize it and add dialogue. In the case of the Monkey King-Bluray the producers cropped the upper and lower frame to make it ""fit your screen"" and added a really horrible 7.1 Dolby whatever bombast sound to trivialize the Chinese soundtrack. Then they manufactured a 3D version to please the kiddies and show it on the Berlin Film Festival. Furthermore they failed to deliver an uncut print for at least the 2D version. With a running time of 93 min it is a bit longer than the 40th Anniversary version (85 min) but shorter than the French DVD (105 min PAL). There are a few frames missing in the French DVD and there is no break between the two parts of the film where the credits are shown like in the 40th Anniversary DVD, so the original running time must be a bit longer (IMDb claims a running time of 114 min) but I think it is the most complete version. I can't really recommend the French DVD because it only contains the French dubbing. The Taiwanese version has ""english"" subtitles but is also cropped and cut and the overall quality is so bad you better throw it in the wastebasket after watching it.

To draw a conclusion: to my knowledge there is no definitive version of the film available on DVD or Bluray to this day. I can't recommend the Bluray. At least not for those truly interested in the history of animation.",1359244800,4,2316,4.551558752997602
