Directed by the great Alexander Mackendrick, this 92-minute black-and-white drama is perhaps not as well known as his other great films such as ""The Man in the White Suit"", ""The Ladykillers"", and ""The Sweet Smell of Success"".  But with sensitive performances from the cast, including 8-year-old Mandy Miller in the title role and Jack Hawkins as her teacher, and Mackendrick's skillful and oftentimes evocative direction, ""Mandy"" is quite a lovely film to see and deserves a rediscovery by modern viewers.

Sadly, home videos of this film are hard to come by.  The only official DVD release is from the UK publisher Optimum Home Video (now called StudioCanal) in 2008.  It is in Region-2 PAL format, which means North American viewers would need a multi-region DVD player that can do PAL-to-NTSC conversion.  And that's not all.  All DVDs made in the UK run 4% faster because the frame rate of PAL TV is 25 frames per second, when a film only runs 24 frames per second.  Those who play DVDs on a PC or Mac can remedy the 4% speedup by using software that can play the disc 4% slower, such as the freeware VLC Player.

The DVD has a nice, clean picture.  Brightness and contrast are sometimes problematic.  The black and white levels sometimes don't look truly black and white, often slightly greyer than they should be.  Edge enhancements are often quite visible as well.  The oftentimes evocative cinematography, with its deliberate use of shadows and lighting, makes these shortcomings quite evident.  Details are OK, but the picture could use a newer, high-def transfer, but then again most old movies do really.  We probably shouldn't be too picky with this film's rare entry into home video.

The initial release of the ""Mandy"" DVD in 2008 did not have English subtitles.  Perhaps after having been called insensitive for not letting the hearing-impaired enjoy this film, the DVD publisher put out a re-release that has English subtitles shortly afterwards.  The edition that has subtitles has the words ""Hard -of-Hearing Subtitles"" printed on the cover's lower right.  The edition that doesn't, doesn't.  So make sure you ask your seller to confirm which edition you are buying.

The subtitles are white with thin dark borders, making them very readable on the black-and-white picture.  The aforementioned shortcoming of the picture not looking as white as it should, ironically makes the white subtitles all the more readable.  Off-screen dialogs are subtitled in a non-italic font, which I think is a mistake.  Environmental sound (e.g. crashing, clapping) is properly indicated in the subtitles.  Even the lack of sound in one instance, when the film shows Mandy's point of view, is indicated with the subtitle ""(Sound muted)"".

The monaural soundtrack, while relatively hiss-free, isn't in the best of shape either.  Some dialogs lack the best clarity that a new audio remaster would provide.  Hence, the subtitles would benefit both hearing and non-hearing viewers alike.",1354233600,4,3577,5.586270871985158
