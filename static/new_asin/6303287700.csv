7842739,4,6303287700,"Following Zatoichi Challenged this film, Zatoichi and The Fugitives, is kind of a let down.  There is lots of drama, as we find out that one of the bandits hiding in the town is, in fact, related to somebody in the town.  And the town's official is helping the bandits hide out.  There are surprises and the feel to the movie is that they wanted to make it dark and gritty and realistic - one woman ALMOST has her kimono peeled off but Zantoichi saves her just in time.  Not as much action as many of the other films and the character of Zatoichi at one point looks more dead than alive.  The music IS becoming original as it seems to be breaking away from the norms and allowing some European influence.  In fact the CD I have&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zatoichi-The-Best-Cuts-1967-1973-Soundtrack/dp/B002YDURUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zatoichi - The Best Cuts (1967-1973) [Soundtrack</a>] comes from this time period - many of the films I will be watching have their sound track on these CD.",1308873600,,1044,5.184523809523809

7842741,2,6303287700,"I will write the same comment on each one that I purchased for my parents.  Although the video quality was good, through generations of copying the audio was lousy.  My parents, who are fluent in Japanese, needed to read the English subtitles to understand what was being said.  Check the quality before keeping the item.",1243382400,,321,4.8
7842742,4,6303287700,"As a lifelong Ichi-San fan (I saw the original TV series in Japan!) I am a little more objective than most about this episode. Chambara and Jidei Geki fans have been spoon fed the colorful myths and fairy tales about Tokugawa era Japan and Japanese life under Bushido. Life was terribly harsh on the rural, working Japanese. The Zatoichi films and maybe ""Ugetsu"" are the only films to show how life really was for the ""little people"". There was no glory, just harsh and deadly reality. If this film is dark and upsetting, it is because it is true to the way life was at that time. I highly recommend it to those who want to see how the Japanese villager had to live. If you want pretty costumes, Court Life and the mythical spiritualism of Bushido, skip this one. It will upset you.",1191456000,4,782,4.4375
7842743,4,6303287700,"One of the major differences in this Zatocihi episode from previous ones is that the ""bad-guys"" seem to be more realistic in this film. In many of the past Ichi films the villians seemed liked bumbling idiots. In this one, director Kimiyoshi Yasuda, who directed several of the Zatocihi episodes, gives the villians a more realistic feeling. Also, the film is quite brutal. And although there is the standard Zatoichi fare that follows almost all of the episodes, this one stands out with just a little bit more in violence.[Such as chopped off limbs]

One of the greatest actors in Japanese cinema is also in the film: [Takashi Shimura] of ""Ikiru"" fame stars as Dr. Junan. It is always a treat to see him in any film. And especially in the Zatoichi series. The cinemantography is not as good as many of the earlier episodes, or the later ones for that matter. Little of the Japanese countryside is shown in the film. Also, there is less humor from Ichi that had become his established trademark in earlier episodes. And as for Ichi's cane-sword, well fans of his will not be disappointed in his usual high body count at the end of the film. I found the film highly enjoyable [not great] but enjoyable, and would recommend it to all.",1157068800,,1233,4.63013698630137
