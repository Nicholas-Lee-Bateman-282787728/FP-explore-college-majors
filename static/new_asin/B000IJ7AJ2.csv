2658790,1,B000IJ7AJ2,"I should've known this was going to be bad when inside the DVD is an advertisement for David Lynch's own brand of coffee beans.  Can we say sell-out!?  I expected these short films to be awesome. Instead what we get are boring and dissapointing short films.  The first film feels amateurish, the 3rd one has David making a lamp for about a half hour that is boring as hell. During the Q&A he repeats the customers questions immediately after hearing the questions and it makes him look stupid and mentally challenged. I expected a lot more out of these along the lines of the ""Short Films of David Lynch"" but this is by far the worst thing Lynch has put out on DVD. FYI- I am a huge David Lynch fan so it does not please me to give this a negative review. There are a lot of Lynch snobs who feel everything he puts out is gold and this is simply not the case. This dvd was a waste of my time and money and I would never watch it again, neither should you.",1170288000,27,955,4.151351351351352

8145988,1,B000IJ7AJ2,"Intensely creative people, and Lynch is certainly one, explore many ideas, often a piece at a time, trying them out, trying them together, rearrranging, adding, removing, and just playing with them before starting on a serious piece of work. Artists' sketchbooks are filled with studies and partially worked ideas, and can be of great interest to students of their work. But for most of us, the ideas that went nowhere should remain there - nowhere.

And, artists may create work with intense personal meaning - but meaning utterly opaque to anyone but themselves. So, I'm not sure how to interpret this collection: as a cinematographer's sketchbook, or as pieces with meaning only to Lynch. Either way, I find this collection self-indulgent and impenetrable. Even ""impenetrable"" need not be a bad thing, if an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/inner-logic/dp/B000HIVIRY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">inner logic</a>&nbsp;becomes visible, but just out of reach. I couldn't even find that here.

Best wishes to all who enjoy this work. Sorry, but I'm not among your number.

8145991,4,B000IJ7AJ2,This is a nice disc to buy when you have everything else Lynch has done on DVD.  The short video called NEIGHBOR BOY alone is worth buying the disc for.  Funny stuff.  I also loved watching David at work in LAMP.  I was fascinated by it.  BUG CRAWLS was also fascinating and I hope we get to see more of that strange world.  It isn't the best Lynch has to offer but it is a nice addition to a Lynch collection and Amazon is selling it at a much better price than I paid for it in a retail store.  I think it is certainly worth checking out if you find David Lynch interesting.  If you liked DUMBLAND you will probably love this.,1187308800,2,628,4.048780487804878
8145992,4,B000IJ7AJ2,"David always said his movies were simply ""moving paintings"" as in they are extensions of how he perceives life to be at one particular instant.

These shorts are all basically moving paintings.  They are surreal imagery and very interesting.  The movies can't really be called movies, they are more like art, except 'Lamp"" which is just him making a lamp.

If you like Lynch, and want to learn about him, laugh with him, and see how he sees the world, this is a DVD for you.  If you are expecting something like 'The Grandmother', it's not here.

Think art rather than cinema.",1187136000,5,576,4.598039215686274

8145994,3,B000IJ7AJ2,"What you think of this collection of Lynch material from his Web site will depend on your expectations. If, like the first reviewer below, you come to it thinking this is a collection of short films, you are apt to be pretty disappointed. But if you understand that this is largely a collection of animated art pieces, you may enjoy this. Some of the pieces, such as ""Industrial Soundscape,"" are basically paintings that move a bit and have accompanying soundtracks. Some, like ""Boat"" and (my favorite) ""Darkened Room,"" basically ARE short films, but different -- a bit more minimalist -- than Lynch's previous shorts as collected in ""The Short Films of David Lynch."" Lynch personally introduces each piece, or you can watch them sans intros. And I have to point out to the reviewer below that Lynch having his own brand of coffee is hardly ""selling out."" In fact, at least part of the reason he's doing it is to help fund his filmmaking. In case you hadn't noticed, Lynch's films have never been what you'd call commercial (in fact, they seem to be getting less so with every passing movie), and financial backing for an avant-garde art film like ""Inland Empire"" isn't exactly easy to come by.",1174780800,24,1194,4.7451923076923075
8145995,5,B000IJ7AJ2,"This is a really nice compilation of short films, commentary, etc. that first appeared on the [...] website.  As I am not a subscriber to the site, these films were all new to me and I enjoyed them very much.  The lineup on the DVD is as follows:

The Darkened Room
Boat
Lamp
Out Yonder - Neighbor Boy
Industrial Soundscape
Bug Crawls
Intervalometer Experiments
Member Questions

My favorite is probably ""Boat"", which conveys a sort of eeriness and then a ride into Darkness with Lynch at the helm.  I also liked ""The Darkened Room"", which, although very simplistic in nature, conveys a deep foreboding atmosphere (i.e., Something has clearly gone wrong and things are likely to worsen).  I also found Lamp to be very interesting as we see David Lynch at work sculpting a lamp and providing commentary as he goes along.

I am a huge fan of David Lynch's work, which clearly influenced my rating for this DVD, but nonetheless, I highly recommend it to all.  I recently had the priveledge of meeting David Lynch in person at the Austin, TX premier of his new film INLAND EMPIRE.  He is a super laid-back guy, with a great sense of humor and was very engaging and accommodating to fans eager to speak with him.

Again, I highly recommend Dynamic:01 - The Best of David [...].",1170460800,36,1272,4.613333333333333
