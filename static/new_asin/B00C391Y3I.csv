My kids went with me and said it was the best show they had ever seen, I agree! Front row helped, lol! Will order this BluRay to relive this concert as it kicked ars! Halford hit the notes but seeing them a few times in the 80's, he has lost a few breaths but still rox!",1367539200,3,447,4.149425287356322
5689530,5,B00C391Y3I,"I got to see this tour on it's final night in Biloxi, Mississippi. It was hands down one of the concerts I have ever been to. The band was extremely tight and ripped through some of their all time hits and classics. This DVD should be something that is a must have for all Priest fans.",1367193600,2,285,4.107142857142857
5689531,5,B00C391Y3I,"I got the honor to see this show in Cincinnati, Ohio and it was fantastic.  If this release is half as good as that live effort was you are in for a treat.  The best part was the selection of songs.  It was a great mixture of old and new and something from every CD they have ever released.  Worth the money.",1366329600,,308,3.9193548387096775

Every song sounded as if it was sung in a lower key. That said - I still enjoyed the show - What a cannon of work ( covers 30 years!) - Hope I'm still kicking ass when I'm in my mid 60's! - Long live the priest .",1450569600,,366,3.5875

5689562,5,B00C391Y3I,"I absolutely love this bluray. Video and audio are outstanding. Performances are outstanding. Can't add much more to what others have said. I do wish they would retire a few of the popular songs from the set list...Breaking the Law, Living After Midnight, etc., ...and throw in some others like The Rage, Delivering the Goods, Raw Deal, Call for the Priest...but that's just me. They did throw in Blood Red Skies which was just awesome! The rest of the set list was great.  My only other complaint would be the rapid fire video editing which seems to be prevalent in just about every recent live DVD/Bluray release.",1419897600,,615,4.747663551401869

5689568,2,B00C391Y3I,"First , when I bought the dvd, I wasn't expecting that much .. Let's be clear : priest without KK downing , is missing something I can't describe . Replacing him by a person that's totally out of subject !! He simply doesn't fit to the world of priest !! I thought I was watching a punk pop teenager guitarist ... With no personality at all !!! C'mon priest , how could u do this for the fans ??? Besides, rob Halford seems to make lots of efforts while singing ... He even let the crowd sing breaking the law ( the masterpiece) in totality !!! I mean, I bought the dvd to hear him, not the audience !! What a mess ...
I still remember back in 2009 when I attend their concert with KK ... It was something !!!
R.I.P Judas Priest... Thanks for the good music you made , and too bad to end (...) the legacy on a false note !!",1410480000,,823,3.993939393939394

5689571,5,B00C391Y3I,"I was fortunate to have seen this tour back in 2011, and I'm even happier that it made it onto DVD and Blu-ray. Too bad a CD wasn't released because Judas Priest was in outstanding form at this show. Oh, when they came out swinging with ""Rapid Fire"" the crowd went insane! There's even a beautiful acoustic version of ""Diamonds and Rust."" I loved it so much that I made my own ""Epitaph"" CD (but don't tell Rob Halford). A great concert from the Godfathers of Heavy Metal.",1407628800,,471,4.363636363636363
5689572,5,B00C391Y3I,"Sound quality was excellent, song selection was great, a little bit for everyone! The band was on their game! The Metal God was the best I've heard him in years! I would have liked to seen more interaction between the crowd and the band and/or Rob, I think that would have upped the adrenalin a bit more. I would recommend this to any Priest fan that didn't have the opportunity to experience their last set of shows.",1407542400,,417,4.428571428571429
5689573,5,B00C391Y3I,"I love Judas Priest but not all their DVD's are great. Epitaph really grabs you and the boys still have it! Definitely thrilled that the fact that it came out on Blu-ray and the whole show was a whirlwind! Great shots, great set list, just simply great. Color was vivid and sharp, sound was wonderful and a complete experience for me.",1407456000,,334,4.491803278688525
5689574,5,B00C391Y3I,This is a great concert memory from what might be their last tour (but doubtful). Every sone is just perfect and Halford is at the top of his game. The Blu-Ray has remarkable color and production and is a great concert to own to recall past memories of them. Well worth having!,1400889600,,277,4.346153846153846

5689580,5,B00C391Y3I,Fantastic show. They are rocking the place big time. A great set list and excellent show. Best live Priest concert since the Turbo tour.,1392595200,,136,4.708333333333333
5689581,3,B00C391Y3I,"In Hi-Def, this show is beautifully shot - except for too much quick editing and very well played by the band. Halford's voice is holding up well despite it's age and wear and tear. New second lead guitarist Richie Faulkner is an adequate replacement for the great Ken Downing, but his oddball gurning and mysterious hand gestures take some getting used to. But my main issue with this concert disc is a THE SOUND MIX!! Judas Priest is one of the greatest HEAVY METAL bands - the guitars are VERY important to the overall sound of the genre. But Faulkner and Glen Tipton's axes are very far back in the mix. The iconic riffs and solos are an overall smooth, mushy fuzz - this is not my opinion; this is a FACT. I've played this concert to three separate people on three separate occasions and without prompting from me, they said: 'What's with the sound?' 'I can't hear the guitars very well' and 'I thought they were supposed to be a metal band'. And no amount of tweaking my home theater amp's settings can improve matters.

It's almost as if the producer of this disc - the legendary Tom Allom, no less!! - didn't want to offend people with the sheer heaviness of this band! The irony of this is amazing, as Allom gave so many of their albums a great sound. The earlier 'Rising In The East' DVD is mixed far better than this show, thus I believe it's a better souvenir of the latter years of Judas Priest. Either they remix this and release it again, or record a final show with a sound and mixing crew more sympathetic to classic Heavy Metal.",1391731200,,1546,4.424561403508772
5689582,5,B00C391Y3I,"No doubt: one of the best bands in the Heavy Metal history. Great music, great live show, great production on DVD.",1391558400,,114,4.476190476190476
5689583,2,B00C391Y3I,"While the sound is excellent and video editing are not bad, Rob Halford's voice is not what it used to be. I have seen them twice in southern Cali and he did sound tired and was not able to hit the notes he once used to hit without any problems. Since this DVD was recorded during the last show of their Epitaph tour, Rob does not look that great. After listening two the first two songs I had to turn this off....this is not vintage Priest at all. Their 1983 show from San Bernardino (comes with Creaming for Vengeance re-release) shows Rob's vocals in their prime. Same for Fuel for Life from Dallas, Texas (1986)...vintage Priest! While Rob and Priest still remain my favorite band of all time, this DVD is unfortunately not their best.",1389830400,,739,4.481481481481482

5689586,4,B00C391Y3I,"I had the opportunity to attend the Epitaph tour passing through South America. The concert on this DVD is exactly the same in terms of lighting, visual effects and setlist I attended. The sound quality is excellent but nevertheless, as in other reviews, the edited footage is based on short shoot of about 5 seconds which leaves not fully enjoy aspects such as Glen solos..",1388016000,,374,4.769230769230769

The sound and video quality in this BD is the best, the show is very good. I remember watching the show in Mexico city's sports palace and i was expecting Halford's voice to be weak and age worn, but surprisingly for me it was powerful and could reach the lowest chords of the songs, this BD captures that, seems like he worked out his voice for this tour. If you like heavy metal, u must have this one.",1381708800,,693,4.065693430656935

5689593,4,B00C391Y3I,"4.5 stars.  Ive been a fan since Point of Entry and saw them on Screaming for Vengeance tour.  Tipton is one of my favorite guitarists, and Halford is one of the best vocalists around.  My point of contention with this release is the production and quick cuts as so many have said. The sound is good, nice stage set, and good crowd though.
My point of contention with the band is Faulkner's leads and fills.  He doesn't play the solos the same way KK did; instead, improvising his own - which to the seasoned listener doesn't always fit, with me at least.  And then his fills, which KK never did live, either - are unnecessary.  And lastly, the antics of his crowd rallying when he should be picking, should be reeled in a bit.  I would guess alot of people in the audience thought they were getting KK.  And then given an unaccompanied guitar solo spot?  Gimme a break here! KK!!  KK!!  KK!!  I would have had serious reservations about touring without Mr Downing, but glad they did one more time, anyway.",1380672000,,1006,4.467032967032967

5689597,3,B00C391Y3I,"Good editing does not draw attention to itself, which unfortunately is not the case here. A whopping 77 camera edits during the Victim of Changes guitar solo alone.  This Editor should never work again.

Also, what's with Halford hunched over and staring at the floor while he is singing...is he arthritic? Check out the 1983 US Festival video (also on youtube) for the real Halford I remember seeing. Yeah, I know he's 60 but that is no excuse for ignoring the audience. Overall, great set-list, stage show, and music but I can't recommend this in its current form.

Please re-release for those with a normal attention span.",1377907200,15,625,4.822429906542056
5689598,5,B00C391Y3I,"Excellent concert video!
I was actually at this show, and it was incredible!  I've seen people complain that Rob Halford wasn't putting enough into the show, and I disagree.  For someone in his sixties, he rocked like a champ!  One of the coolest parts was when the audience sang ""Breaking The Law"".  Everyone was all swept up in the emotion and it was groovy.  Great show, great DVD.",1377388800,,384,4.588235294117647

The sound is down and dirty and got the hair up on the back of my neck. I agree with some comments on the over use of quick camera angle cuts but the music cuts through it all. Driving my wife crazy with the volume but that's the only way to enjoy this. ""Metal Gods"" and ""Prophesy"" will get your head banging. Made me feel 25 again! Thanks for that.",1376438400,,462,3.967741935483871
5689601,5,B00C391Y3I,"With over two hours of Priest style Heavy Metal I was thrilled when I heard the first notes to Heading Out to The Highway to the powerful version of Beyond the Realms of Death.  Halford and company deliver another stellar concert experience, and even with KK Downing gone from Priest's line up, the addition of Ritchie Falkner as his replacement I feel was well received and I felt to some degree that Ritchie actually seemed to breath some new life to the band. His interaction with Glenn Tipton throughout the concert seem really fresh and very energetic, and made the experience for me all the better.

Of course the members of Priest have grown older, and even the Metal God has succumbed to the ravages of time. Some songs where I wish I would have heard the legendary high notes that made him the singer that other metal gods could only aspire to, but I was surprised at some of the notes that he was able to hit during several of the songs that he performed.

All in all if your a fan of the Priest, than this is a DVD that you'll want to add to your Metal collection.",1376265600,,1075,4.365
5689602,5,B00C391Y3I,"If you are a fan of the Priest, this is the DVD for you!
- Halford's voice has never been better. Even Painkiller is up to snuff here.
- Newbie guitarist Ritchie Faulkner is so amazing that you hardly miss KK.
- Ian Hill's bass is actually audible at several moments.

Maybe all the fast edits were an attempt to make the show seem more exciting than it actually was (video editing is REALLY terrible).  Faulkner is very, very good... but it just shows you how much greater KK Downing is.  Playing is SO much more than technique, and the secret glue is just not there... You can just feel that things are not quite right.  Judas Priest needs all 4 original members to be complete.  It seems just as foolish as replacing Halford way back when...

5689624,5,B00C391Y3I,"This is a fine blu-ray to add to your heavy metal collection,if but for one caveat.....You gotta deal with Rob,who appears not to be in the best of voice for this show. Pitch errors are a more prominant issue in this show than on previous outings. Also, Rob sports a cane for a few segments ,perhaps baring evidence that the rumored recent back surgery was true after all. Mind you, the rest of the band more than make up for it with a punishing aural onslaught not unlike the best live Priest from the past. In particular, kudos go out to Richie Faulkner for stepping up to the plate to replace the now retired K.K.Downing on guitar,and then knocking it out of the park. Richie has a style of soloing that is very favorably compared to Zakk Wylde, and his spontaneous call-and-answer lead riffs with Priest vet Glenn Tipton are well composed and fitting with the Priest tradition. It should go without saying that the rock-solid rhythm section of drummer Scott Travis and bassist Ian Hill bring in yet another great freight-train of a performance,surging confidently through an over 2 hour set of metal classics. Faulkner's stage presence is spot-on as well,never trying to step on anyone's toes or hog the spotlight, even though the man definitely has the goods. He simply fits like an old comfortable shoe, and that's the way we should want it to go for our Rock heroes in the final chapter(maybe) of their long and storied career. No drama.

I was able to crank this up and experience the high energy, driving power of these true metal gods. All the song selections were excellent (they range across all of Judas Priest's albums), but there was a section in the middle with Metal Gods, Prophecy, and Nightcrawler were I knew I was watching the best metal performers on the planet. Rob Halford, although advancing in years, is still able to belt out the songs. His stage presence is absolutely sinister. He is a true legend. The new guitarist, Richie Faulkner is very good as well. He would have fit right into that golden age of heavy metal era from the late 70's to early 80's. And as an aside, wouldn't it be awesome if the teenagers of today were blaring the music of heavy metal out their car speakers instead of that insipid and lame rap music we hear? The young men of today have been so emasculated and they don't even know it. Anyway, this DVD is awesome. The only drawback is that the London crowd only seemed half into it at times.

5689627,4,B00C391Y3I,"Dvd has a very good sound, and the band plays great. It's over 2 hours and 20 minutes with a great setlist. The film shifts around too much, which is annoying. They don't show Ian enough. Richie kicks ass. The only Halford scream that I think was edited was at the end of ""Rapid Fire."" Rob hits the high notes better than he has since 2000. The problem is that he sings all the verses like he's singing the verses to ""Beyond the Realms of Death."" He over dramatizes the vocals in songs like ""Heading Out to the Highway"" or ""Green Manalishi."" His voice doesn't have the charisma that it used to have, and he sounds like he's in pain as he sings. He also seems to blurt out the lyrics too quickly. This dvd is better than ""Rising in the East"" and the ""British Steel 30th Anniversary,"" but it's not as good as ""Priest Live"" or ""Live Vengeance '82.""",1371859200,3,845,4.2875

The usual classics are here but you'll also find some deep cuts such as Never Satisfied. The sound & video are pristine. This is a truly remarkable concert that any metal head would love to own.,1371859200,,304,4.350877192982456
5689629,5,B00C391Y3I,"Judas Priest has been part of my musical life since my neighbor and I saw the cover to ""Sad Wings of Destiny"" in the LP rack way back in 1976.  I have been a huge ...no massive fan.. of the Priest ever since.  They are one of the most important and legendary bands of all-time.  PERIOD.

Now I have been on record here that I was not a fan of the music and tours that followed since Rob Halford returned to the band in 2003.  I didn't care for ""Angel of Retribution"" and really disliked ""Nostradamus"".  I also thought that ""Rising in the East"" sounded tired and ..well...old.  Especially Rob.  The show I saw on that same tour was disappointing as his vocals were stranded and harsh.  The other thing that I noticed was that when Rob would tour with his band Halford, the live performances were honestly crushing what he was doing with Judas Priest.  I never had one issue with the tours over the past several years with that band.

So I was a bit uneasy about this new release.  Farewell tour or not I wasn't expecting too much at this stage. Also without K.K...whom I think (along with Brad Whitford) is one of the most under-rated guitar players in metal, I wasn't sure it would have the same classic Priest vibe to it.  Oh my goodness was I wrong....and thank God for that!  This is a flaming hot, brilliant and powerful set.

So what's the difference from all the other tours? Simple..Rob is singing his lungs out.  After shaking my walls with this recording...that is the most enjoyable show I have heard from Priest since the 1990 ""Painkiller"" tours.  It was just one killer song to another and Halford was just off the charts good.

As far as the DVD video and stuff...yes..there are some serious editing issues..(watch Scott Travis during the drum intro to Painkiller)..they clearly took different footage and moved it around a bit.  But in the end...I am not too bothered with that aspect.  The colors are very strong and the Tom Allom recording...is well....PRIEST LIKE!  As one would expect from the man who captured and help create the Priest sound all those decades ago.

The stage is awesome, the songs great, and the performances recorded with power and clarity.  Not much more you can ask for there!

If this is the last of the band live ..then what a send off!  (Honestly I don't want to see them out again and risk messing up what I have just experienced..but that's just me.)

So, if you love Heavy Metal..and love vintage style, old school, in your face power....and most of all...Love Judas Priest, this is a must have item.  I have listened to the entire show three days in a row and never once cringe expecting a bad spot to show up as in shows from the past.

Long live the Priest...and as they said..""WE ARE HEAVY F***ING METAL!!!!""",1371686400,,2758,4.517171717171717

I didn't mind Ritchie interacting with the audience. He's no KK, but he's a great guitarist. Check out his solos in 'Victim Of Changes', Another thing Coming', & 'Beyond The Realms Of Death'. JP must have tried out thousands of guitarists.
  The drums and bass are fantastic in this mix! Everything is good in this mix! The song selection is also really good. The only low point for me is the choice of an Acoustic version of 'Diamonds and Rust.' I prefer the metal version! I prefer the metal version on all songs!

5689632,5,B00C391Y3I,"I love this DVD...I've already watched about 5-6 times. The sound is great and the setlist is a dream for Priest fans. Especially, the deep tracks like ""Starbreaker"" ""Night Crawler"" ""The Sentinel"" and ""Blood Red Skies""

...and what better way to open the show than Rapid Fire and Metal Gods! For some reason, much better this time around than the British Steel tour.

Rob Halford's voice is in fine form on this tour as he nails some amazing high notes during Night Crawler, Blood Red Skies, and Victim of Changes. His only weakness is changing outfits between every song. One thing I love about a HALFORD show is he sticks to jeans and t-shirt.

KK Downing is greatly missed, but Richie Falkner really delivers the goods. I especially like his intro to ""the Sentinel"" with Glenn.

The editing on the DVD is a bit fast, however the cuts are not just completely random. For example it will go from wide shot of the stage to a medium close up of Glenn to a close up of Glenn's face to an extreme close up of his fingers on the guitar.

One major weakness of this DVD is lack of crowd shots. They keep cutting back to this generic master shot of the crowd from the side, but there are very few close ups of any fans. If you were at this show, don't expect to find yourself! It's almost like they didn't have permission to film the crowd or something?! Compare this with the Electric Eye 1986 concert in Dallas where the fans are a major part of the concert.

I was lucky enough to attend the Epitaph show in Denver and this London DVD is almost identical. One minor detail that I miss is the cool as heck Epitaph/Legacy banner during Blood Red Skies. At least all the pyro is still being used.

Anyway, if you saw Priest on the Epitaph tour this is a great souvenir to pick up and relive the excitement. The massive setlist should please all types of Priest fans.

Please note the setlist on the Amazon production information is way out of order.  Never fear, the actual DVD has the real setlist in the order it was played during the tour.",1371340800,7,2036,4.3936170212765955

5689634,5,B00C391Y3I,"Overall, great show.  Great selection of songs and the sound is tight even though KK is no longer with them.  The new guitarrist kid seems to fill in pretty good, but he has a long way to catch up with Tipton's and KK's playing.  He needs to concentrate more on the music and 'delivering the goods', rather than the looks and the trying to look cool on stage with the old masters.  I have one little complaint as well, Scott Travis looks like he's going to a 9 to 5 job nowadays.  He seems bored and disengaged while playing.  Altough he keeps up well.  Looks like his heart is not entirely in the love of playing anymore; unlike Glenn, Rob, and Ian who after 40 years of Rocking they still enjoy being on stage, and enjoy giving their fans what they like.  Other than the visuals, 5 stars for the quality of the music.  The sound, the end result is what matters in the end.  Thank you JP for putting out this on DVD.  It was a pleasure to hear some of the early stuff from the 70's albums, very well executed. A true treat to your fans.",1371168000,,1037,4.186868686868687

Scott is a thunderous god on drums and this new kid Richie is a Beast on lead guitar taking over where K.K left but I swear this kid doesnt even strum on his guitar & these amazing sounds still screech out. dvd comes in a cd jewel case rather than your usual dvd case which makes it much cooler the insert includes awesome photos in a 12 page full color booklet .

Heck, it's the norm on almost every hard rock or heavy metal concert DVD/ Blu-ray I own. I would prefer a concert video that doesn't seem to be edited by someone with attention deficit disorder, but that seems to be the industry standard. Maybe one day it will change, but I wouldn't bet on it.

What I DO have a problem with is the director using visual effects on the existing video to create psychedelic "" tracer"" effects on the action on stage. He doesn't use it every song, but unfortunately on the numbers I most looked forward to seeing ... ""Starbreaker"" and ""Beyond the Realms of Death"" ... Why is this necessary? Anyone who buys this Blu-ray would be perfectly content with the awesome sound and picture quality.

This director wants to put his own imprint on the product, obviously. He should take a look at the Talking Heads ""Stop Making Sense"" and see what an established director does with a live performance. Capture it. Don't try to get fancy.

I would give this five stars if not for the (at times) distracting direction. Don't distract from the performance. just capture it.",1369872000,12,1238,4.5675675675675675

The set list is what you would expect with the exceptions of a great version of Never Satisfied from Rock-a-Rolla and a blistering version of Beyond the Realms of Death from Stained Class.  Most the set is material Judas Priest have played in the past, nevertheless, it's a fun show to watch.  I do love the Priest!  My main problem with the DVD is the editing--which is horrible.  Alex Walker (the director/ editor) can't stay on a shot for more than a second before making a cut.  There must be 10,000 edits in this show so If your prone to seizures you may wanna stay away from this one!

5689649,5,B00C391Y3I,"I've seen a preview of this film, and it's very reminiscent of the Epitaph Concert I went to back in October of 2011. While the band's past their prime, there's no doubt they still have plenty of talent left to spare. Maybe I'm biased because this was my first concert experience, but the Epitaph DVD is a good send-off for the band, and has the best version of ""Victim of Changes"" I've ever heard.",1369612800,2,398,4.391891891891892
5689650,2,B00C391Y3I,"I have not seen this video in its entirety but watched the one-hour show on MTV last night. Let me clarify up front that I am a huge Judas Priest fan. I have CDs, DVDs and have seen them live several times. However, if the rest of Epitaph follows what I saw last night, it is a disappointing end for the band. This was the last show of the tour and perhaps the band was tired on the night of the filming. It was sad to see Rob Halford mainly talking through songs instead of singing them. He appeared to strain on the most basic parts and often relied on the audience to sing them, an old trick that singers use when they can't perform.  This reached its nadir when he had the audience sing 'Breaking the Law'in its entirety! He didn't sing a note of it. Rob also looked like a tired old man at times. Having seen how he can energize a stage in the past, it is painful for me to write this. The one good thing was that the instruments were well recorded and the sound well balanced. Scott Travis, Ian Hill and Glen Tipton provided that typical Priest sound that fans all know and love. Richard Faulkner, who replaced K.K. Downing, is a talented guitarist but I found him to be rather annoying on stage. He was more intent on pointing at the audience and trying to get the spotlight on himself than in concentrating on playing. He at times seemed to play slightly out of synch with the rest of the band.  As a final concert and a purported goodbye from the band, although they stated they would still play select dates in the future instead of full tours, this did not live up to the quality of shows and music that Priest is capable of putting out. I was really looking forward to this release, but after what I saw last night, I doubt I will waste money on it. Maybe the Metal God needs to rest for a while, if not hang it up. I look forward to read what other Priest fans thought.",1369526400,15,1882,4.196132596685083
5689651,5,B00C391Y3I,I saw the Epitaph concert video when it was out for a one day showing in a local movie theater.  Having seen Priest on this tour I was aware of the fantastic songs and sound that the band put together on the tour.  This concert video is a must for any Priest fan.  All the great songs and the band sounds fantastic.  Rob's voice is great and the band delivers like very few bands new or old can.  My only negative on the video is the over use of changing camera views.  The video quality is top notch but too many times the camera keeps switching quickly between close ups of the band members.  Not a deal breaker but something I noticed and wished there was less of.  Outside of that this is a worthy addition to any Priest fans collection of Metal magic.  Long live the Priest.,1369094400,35,779,4.20945945945946

5689653,5,B00C391Y3I,Looking at the playlist the songs and the concert were probably awesome. Envy I Feel. But wondering why the band Judas Priest who made great albums in Jugulator and Demolition would leave out songs. I think Rob could spruce up the vocals on such songs such as Hell is Home or Subterfuge or even Blood Stained. The dvd is still great but I wish they would consider some of the other two albums that Rob wasn't on.,1368489600,5,412,4.363636363636363
5689654,5,B00C391Y3I,I saw them at the Izod Center (Meadowlands) in New Jersey November of 2011 on this tour. The show was absolutely amazing! I was hoping that they would film a show for this tour. I can't wait for this to be released!,1368403200,,215,4.142857142857143

8576958,5,B00C391Y3I,"Amazing! Yes, Rob's voice is showing signs of his age, and he doesn't have nearly the same punch vocally as he did in his prime. But Rob's ""aging"" voice is still legendary and better than a lot of the new, younger singers out there by far. The set list is great, too. Even has a track from ""Nostradamus,"" which is one of Priest's greatest and most underrated and under-appreciated albums ever! Rising In The East is (to me) a better live show than Epitaph (if only because it has the song ""Hellrider"" on it, which is an amazing showcase of the signature Priest style - dueling guitars and Rob's Metal God vocals!), but Epitaph is still worth owning if you're a Priest fan!",1487376000,,672,4.471544715447155
