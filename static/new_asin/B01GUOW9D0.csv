8763569,4,B01GUOW9D0,"Outfoxed is a movie that uses the voices of former Fox associates to illuminate some of the inner workings of Fox News. It demonstrates the conservative slant of the network and how the upper chain of the company gives specific instructions to the news reporters to leave out certain information or not discuss certain topics. It also explains some of the rhetoric and persuasive techniques Fox uses to not fully commit to certain opinions such as saying ""Some people say..."" The techniques are also used to keep opinions that they don't agree with off of the network such as some of the more liberal viewpoints on a topic.",1483747200,2,623,4.777777777777778
