This video is my favorite video so far. Thanks Baby Rodenburg!",1299196800,,260,4.2
8299404,2,B001ERFQWU,"i bought this dvd because i wanted a sign language dvd for my daughter. i was under the impression that the whole dvd was sign language, but its not. a small portion of it goes over some words. they teach you banana, more, eat, cookie and please in sing language. the alphabet, colors , numbers, and animals are not in sign language. it doesnt keep my daughters attention through the whole thing, half way through shes ready to do something else. i really wish they would have gone over the alphabet in sign language. overall, i probably wouldnt buy it again just because it wasn't what i personally was looking for.",1264032000,,616,4.558558558558558
8299405,4,B001ERFQWU,"I have a 3 year old and an 18 month old and both really enjoyed the DVD. They were both introduced to infant signing, so they were very familiar with the content of the DVD. It does a great job of introducing animals, colors, letters, numbers, and basic signs. My kids ask to watch it over and over!",1235347200,,299,4.172413793103448
