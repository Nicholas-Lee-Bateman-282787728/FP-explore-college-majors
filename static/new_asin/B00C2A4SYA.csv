5687571,5,B00C2A4SYA,"Quite simply the best film adaptation of a Shakespeare comedy ever made. I saw it 3 times in 48 hours, enjoying it more each time.  Brilliant in every way. As though the Bard had anticipated 'The Philadelphia Story' and Woody Allen.  The black-and-white chiaroscuro illuminates the play perfectly, the direction is always inspired, and the actors all superb. If this film does not hook a new generation on Shakespeare, then nothing will. There are not enough superlatives for it, not even in Shakespeare's vocabulary....",1376870400,20,520,5.178571428571429
5687572,4,B00C2A4SYA,"Whedon keeps Shakespeare's text intact, but changes the setting entirely. Instead of seventeenth century trappings,this is entirely contemporary - with solemn bodyguards, papparazza-on-staff, and a booziness that brings the Gatsby era to mind.

A few details work in surprising ways. A woman takes the role of Conrad, and completely reworks the character in the process. Fillion's Dogberry approaches the level set by Michael Keaton in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Branagh-s/dp/B0000714BZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Branagh's</a>&nbsp;star-studded version. And, in touchstone moments, the conversations that Benedick and especially Beatrice ""overhear"" have all the comic quality of any rendering I've seen, and better than many. You simply have to experience for yourself Amy Acker's physical comedy in the Beatrice scenes.

This won't convert anyone put off by the archaic language, but might be a good introduction for someone unfamiliar with Shakespeare and with how contemporary his timeless topics can be.

5687573,5,B00C2A4SYA,"I am buying this and plan to rewatch it several times. I thought the acting was terrific, particularly Alexis Denisof, Amy Acker, Nathan Fillion and Reed Diamond. Many excellent supporting actors and actresses too. The modern spin was clever and surprising. Also, there was some beautiful music during the movie, written and produced by Whedon and family, using Shakespeare verses. There is definitely something magical about Whedon's directing abilities!",1376524800,7,455,5.608695652173913
5687574,5,B00C2A4SYA,"Joss Whedon's modern-dress version of ""Much Ado About Nothing""--filmed in black and white, in twelve days, in his own Los Angeles house--actually manages to exceed Kenneth Branagh's version of twenty years ago. Branagh's version, to be sure, may have Roger Lanser's glorious color cinematography of a sumptuous Tuscan villa, as well as magnificent performances by Emma Thompson and Branagh as Beatrice and Benedick. But Whedon's version, though slightly claustrophobic, feels more unified than Branagh's, and Whedon's ensemble cast is more consistently excellent than Branagh's.

Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof may not be as golden-throated in speaking the Bard's verse as Thompson and Branagh, but they are just as adept in portraying Beatrice and Benedick's emotions, and they are the superior physical comedians. In fact, Whedon's cast is wonderful straight down the line: Reed Diamond as Don Pedro, Clark Gregg ss Leonato, and especially Nathan Fillion as Dogberry. Fillion's masterful underplaying, taking full advantage of every malaprop, is better than Michael Keaton's heavily Beetlejuiced portrayal in Branagh's film. Also, Sean Maher is incomparably better as the treacherous Don John than Keanu Reeves, who looked perfect but sounded like he was coming out of anesthesia.

The B&W photography in Whedon's film creates its own cool, jazz-tinged magic, an enormous contrast to the occasionally forced hilarity in Branagh's version. Whedon's ""Much Ado"" is a perfect post-Watergate Shakespearian romp.",1376092800,298,1506,5.688888888888889
5687575,5,B00C2A4SYA,"This film was a delightful adaptation of a most entertaining play. Whedon captures the screwball nature of Beatrice and Benedick's romance, as well as the dark thread that is the Hero and Claudio plot. Very approachable for Shakespeare, the dialogue is generally fairly straightforward to follow. Terrific performances. It is astounding that so much could be achieved on the barest minimum budget and in such a tight timescale. It was filmed in 12 days with little longer than that in preparation. One of the leads was only signed on the day before filming began and had to master his lines and performance between shooting. Unbelievably good in those circumstances!
Watch it. You won't regret it.",1375747200,106,697,5.069565217391304

5687612,2,B00C2A4SYA,"Beatrice did a good job.  I found the music and ""props""  like constant drinking very distracting. The black and white choice didn't do anything to enhance the play.  The music was absolutely terrible.  Some of the actors were very flat as well.  There were some good performances but on the whole didn't keep my interest.",1498435200,,321,4.763636363636364

The modern context makes it somewhat easier to understand, and Joss Whedon just completely does it justice.  three friends who are very much into Shakespeare love it--one of whom, an English teacher, classes it as her favorite version.

It's hard to believe that neither Sean Maher nor Nathan Filion have previously done Shakespeare.

The extras on it are worth a watch too.",1492128000,3,488,5.0375

5687689,5,B00C2A4SYA,"Joss Whedon does a great rendition of the Shakespeare Classic ""Much Ado About Nothing"". It has actors from all his best projects including Buffy, Angel,  Dollhouse and more. However, this is no science fiction geek fest, it's an artfully done, modernized take on the original play. I found it to be delightful and funny at times, and the romance between the two leads to be well portrayed as two stubborn matching wits. However, I also feel that Joss and crew found a way to underscore how dark parts of this storyline really are. Obviously, some of the stuff is over exaggerated and is supposed to be for comedic value, but you do see the real darkness in some of the foibles caused by bad assumptions that could have been easily rectified before it effected everybody on the film in terrible ways. One of the best actors in the film had to be Franz Kranz aka Topher Brink from Dollhouse. He really tackles a wide range of emotions from silly to very seriously dark.

Joss Whedon actually filmed this at his Los Angeles home and many of the actors did their own wardrobe. It was a labor of love and it shows.

I highly recommend giving this a watch.",1464912000,9,1150,4.519230769230769

5687691,4,B00C2A4SYA,"I have to go with a separate, but equal kind of review for Joss Whedon's upgrade to Much Ado. The Kenneth Brannagh version of this movie is still my favorite, but this one has a few upgrades that make it a higher quality version. First, and perhaps most important, the casting in Whedon's is MUCH more consistent than the 90s version. That being said, the individual performances in Whedon's version fall a little short of Emma Thompson, Kenneth Brannagh, and Michael Keaton. That isn't to say that their Whedon-verse counterparts aren't wonderful in their own right, it's just...different. I don't think that the update to modern times or to black and white really adds or subtracts anything. Again, it's just...different.",1464307200,,723,5.033333333333333
5687692,5,B00C2A4SYA,"My favorite version of ""Much Ado"" from an unexpected source. Great cast with a Dogberry who's actually good...

My professor tried to make it interesting by playing the 1998 movie with Denzele Washington in it, but I found myself completely bored. After googling some cliff notes as my last resort to passing this section of the class, I ran across this remake. I completely enjoyed it because it had a modern feel, but still used the text, so that I could understand what was going on.

5687730,5,B00C2A4SYA,"A fun rendition of one of my favorite Shakespeare plays. Especially rewarding for Joss Whedon fans, as the cast consists (not surprisingly) of actors from his various television and film projects. It uses the now familiar motif of modern setting/classic script. It is executed well, with the modern surroundings aiding, rather than hindering, comprehension of the Elizabethan dialogue. I am no theater critic, but I was impressed with most of the performances. Their actors' styles ranged from Reed Diamond's wonderfully natural approach (he really makes the lines seem like natural speech, which also enhances comprehension--my favorite style of presenting Shakespeare) to Alexis Denisof's more formal reading. Clark Gregg (you'll recognize him as the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent from the Marvel movies) just plain makes things fun, and Sean Mayer (Firefly) makes a fabulous villain--something he had surprisingly never done before. Amy Acker is captivating as Beatrice, and Jillian Morgese is lovely as Hero, though she seems to be a bit of an amateur among pros. If I have one complaint, it is that I don't feel as much chemistry as I'd like between Benedick and Beatrice. In fact, I feel that Hero and Claudio show more chemistry on screen. This is highly subjective, of course, and opinions vary I'm sure. Also, Nate Fillion and Tom Lenk have great chemistry as Dogberry and Verges (comic relief).
The song ""Sigh No More"" wa my favorite part of the film. Joss shows his brilliance as a musician once again by putting Shakespeare's poem to haunting melody. Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen nail it in their performance (you may recognize the couple from Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog). And finally, the setting--Whedon's actual home--is a real winner. All in all, the film is just fun, unpretentious, and bears repeat viewing (thank you, William Shakespeare). It is certainly worth a couple of hours' time for anyone who is a fan of Shakespeare or romantic comedy.
I absolutely love the song ""Sigh no More"" sung during the party scene. Zach Whedon did a b",1459209600,4,2053,5.113095238095238

5687732,3,B00C2A4SYA,"There were times when I wanted to stop watching this, but I watched it all. Amy Acker is wonderful, but I didn't care for Alexis Denisof. I disagreed with Whedon's interpretation of Beatrice and Benedick's relationship (it seemed more spiteful than playful scorn, which I think is the correct interpretation). Acker was the only actor who could act and speak the language at the same time -- in fact, she was thoroughly enjoyed and the only reason why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 -- but the others sort of crumbled at monologues (perhaps a case of poor directing more than poor acting, I don't know).

In the end, I kind of wished I had chosen Branaugh's version.",1458950400,,666,4.55

5687734,5,B00C2A4SYA,"Nice idea from Joss Whedon, get all your actor friends together.  Get a script for a Shakespeare comedy, use your home for the set and let the cameras roll.  Great cast, and to pull this off had to be difficult.  However, everyone seemed to be having so much fun in the process.

To make a normal film is one thing, to have all the dialogue in Shakespeare mode took a lot of talent and it was great to watch!  I enjoyed the feel of filming in black and white. If you are a fan of Joss Whedon or Shakespeare you will enjoy this nice little movie.

Amy Acker, Alexis Denisisof, and Fran Kranz are in the cast.  So we have Claire and Topher back from the Doll House!!  But the real treat is the double wedding at the end of the film.  Beatrice and Benedick tie the knot.  But all I could envision throughout this film was finally Fred and Wesley will live Happily Ever After!!

The actors, all veterans of Joss Whedon's past works, did an unbelievable job of speaking Shakespeare's words as if they spoke that way every day, and their emotions rang so true. Nathan Fillion's Dogberry had me in tears of mirth! And Clark Gregg was so loveable I wanted to hug him through the screen.

5687759,1,B00C2A4SYA,"I love Joss Whedon's work. Huge Avengers/Shield/Firefly fangirl and I have a ridiculous crush on Clark Gregg.

I also LOVE Shakespeare.  Much Ado About Nothing is one of my favorite of his works, definitely my favorite comedy.

With these two loves, you would think that this version would be two great tastes that taste great together, but regrettably, no.  Although I do passionately adore Branagh's version of the play (and no one can touch Emma Thompson's performance, ever), the differences between the two interpretations are not actually the problem.  And I have no objections to modern settings of the plays - David Tennant's Hamlet comes to mind as a mind-blowing example. (No seriously, don't miss that. Jaw-dropping and heart breaking)  The real travesty in this movie is that it seems that all the actors were told to act as if they were bored out of their minds.  Or under extreme sedation, perhaps?  There is no *zing* in this film.  The overwhelming tone is one of complete apathy. I know that these are all capable performers, and goodness knows it cannot be the writing, so the fault must be in the direction.  It's a shame, really.

True, was considerably downsized from Team Branagh's 1993 triumph (a suburban California home rather than lush Tuscan villa) but Whedon (and some BTVS and later series cast) treat the material well, balanced, on the same page, and gave the comedic elements full play. (Branagh was burdened by his typical effort to enlist popular  U.S. actors in his cast--in Much Ado, badly imbalanced: Michael Keaton, as always, did wonderfully for Branagh; Kenau Reeves did not.)  As I recall, the Whedon version could have better explicated the conflict between half-brothers Don Pedro and Don John ... but even the Bard (and Branagh) never worked this out with complete success.",1451779200,,738,5.237288135593221

If you don't have the patience or taste for Shakespeare, you'll probably want to give this one a pass -- but if you do, it is surely worth a watch.",1451088000,,504,4.905882352941177
5687762,4,B00C2A4SYA,"I really LIKED this movie.  Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof were lovely in it, and, really, I thought every actor in it gave the Kenneth Branagh version a run for its money EXCEPT Nathan Fillion--for some reason there seemed to be leveling issues in every scene he was in where his dialog was noticeably lower volume than the rest of the characters.  Also, Michael Keaton simply blew me away as Dogberry.  I really couldn't picture anyone else in the role.  Even as I was watching Nathan Fillion I was actually seeing Michael Keaton.

In comparison to the Kenneth Branagh version, however, the acting as a whole is uniformly better or equivalent.  I loved Kenneth Branagh as Benedick, but I also love Alexis Denisof, etc.  The one real scene stealer for me was Fran Kranz.  Wow, that lad has acting chops.

My biggest complaint in this version is the cinematography.  Yes the choice to use black and white was a thoughtful one, and in several scenes you as the viewer can tell how much planning went into what was being shot.  And then there were scenes which just confused the heck out of me.  Costuming, in general, was a disaster.  There were far too many tiny prints with strong contrasts of dark and light which, without color, simply caused a headache.  Also, what era were they going for here.  The inside of Joss Whedon's house is, understandably, modern.  But the women are all in dresses throughout, which seem to be going for a fifties vibe.... I don't get it.

Every time I could ignore the cinematography details, I truly enjoyed this experience.  I would certainly say it's on level with the Kenneth Branagh version, although, if it had been filmed differently, I'm pretty sure I would have thought Joss Whedon's version was the better.",1450569600,,1747,4.70957095709571

5687816,2,B00C2A4SYA,"Aside from the deadpan and awesome little scene in the swimming pool, the movie devalued humor and joy in favor of Whedon's trademarks: slickness and cynicism.  The Benedick and Beatrice ""overhearing"" scenes are playful, but almost reluctantly.  Benedick doing pushups is like a painfully awkward parody of Branagh's silly posturing in his own (much funnier) take on the scene.  Dogberry is a stooge here, but robbed of lines to  the point where he's a fairly run-of-the-mill stooge.  The gleeful energy of the ""we are the only true love gods"" plot being hatched is absent, because it is supposed to follow on the heels of the ridiculously happy engagement of Claudio and Hero, which is itself joyless here.

If meant to evoke its own small budget and the fantasy of staging a minimalist homemade Shakespearean movie with friends, this production might be satisfying to some.  It is subtly acted and relies fully on personalities without getting boring.  Yet, this isn't without Hollywood polish by any means.  In my opinion, this ran the risk that all modernized Shakespeare runs: of putting Shakespeare lines into the mouths of people who seem like the type to roll their eyes at Shakespeare's dated jokes, Shakespeare's ""cliche"" melodrama, and Shakespeare's overblown characters.  Older theater and film ran the risk of turning Shakespeare into a sickly-sweet, much-too-colorful, much too grandiose affair that was all pomp and no nuance.  But now we are more in danger of a bored Shakespeare.  That's fashionable, but it's not quite right.",1443484800,2,1543,5.152610441767068

5687823,4,B00C2A4SYA,"This version is a lot of fun. What I particularly love about it is that this is a bunch of friends who got together and did some Shakespeare for no reasons other than wanting to, having the time and opportunity, and already being professionals. Their day jobs, after all, are basically the same thing: making good shows.

Part of what makes this so enjoyable is figuring out other shows these people have been in. Another part is the fact that Shakespeare knew how to write good theater, so the material plays very well even though the language is archaic. And of course there's the pleasure of comparing it to other versions and seeing differences in the way the story is presented.

It's my understanding that Joss Whedon offered his home as the set, along with his considerable musical ability. I wouldn't have believed he could take Shakespeare's ""Sigh No More"" and turn it into a sophisticated, charming, and completely beguiling song, but he did. I would also love to be invited to a party like the one in the garden, with delightful masks, good food, and some acrobats performing on a very high swing.

That said, the modern setting causes some confusion. I'm all for modern adaptations of Shakespeare, but there were a few things about this one in particular that were jarring:

First, it isn't really clear who these people are supposed to be in a modern context. None of the dialogue was changed, so they refer to the wars and titles and locales of the original, while wearing modern dress in a modern home. It wasn't clear what was intended - whether they were supposed to be secret service agents or FBI agents or something else entirely, and this distracted a bit from the story.

Second, the differences in mores and expectations between Shakespeare's time and our own are thrown into stark contrast. The uproar over Claudio's accusations (especially Leonato's despair and Hero's collapse), don't make much sense in a world where premarital sex is common, even expected. Beatrice is shown engaging in sex herself, and so the idea that Hero would be ruined forever because she is not a maid just doesn't fit.

Still, an entertaining way to spend a few hours, with some real laugh-out-loud moments.",1441411200,,1348,4.873362445414847
5687833,5,B00C2A4SYA,"This is one of my favorites of Shakespeare's plays, and aside from a live stage performance, this is my favorite version (so far) of it.  Thanks to Joss Whedon and the very talented Clark Gregg, I finally <i>get</i> Leonato.  I'd always been so vexed with him for saying such terrible things to Hero at the alter, but now I get it.  By making Leonato a politician in this film Joss highlights what Leonato's world have been like, even back in 16th century Italy. It's hard for him to know who to trust.  Alliances shift, backroom deals get made, people lie to his face, but at home there's his lovely daughter Hero, whom Leonato can trust to always be on his side.  Then all of a sudden this horrible ""evidence"" gets thrown in his face that his wonderful daughter isn't even remotely who he's always believed her to be, that she's a cheater and a liar - that she has lied not only to her fiance, but to <i>him,</i> and he is devastated.  When he's yelling at her at the alter it's because he's heartbroken, and kind of terrified, because the one person he has always trusted has suddenly, horribly been proven (or so he believes) utterly untrustworthy.  Poor Leonato!  So many thanks to Clark Gregg for getting that across!

Sorry, rambling a bit, but having that lightbulb moment about a character after having read the play so many times before was quite delightful!

Anyway, coming into the film I wasn't sure I'd enjoy the modern setting.  Seeing a modern spin on Shakespeare can be risky for me (I've seen some that I really wasn't too keen on), but for me the whole cast really pulled it off in this one.",1440028800,,1610,4.517241379310345

Joss Whedon has taken the story and placed it in a modern day upscale house and neighborhood. The prince and gentlemen wear suits and the swords are revolvers.

The dialogue, however, is authentically the Bard's.

The use of modern props and tropes actually helped, in my mind, to translate the story into something accessible, and by the end, I was in the grip of a desire to see how it would all play out.

Yes, certainly, from the standpoint of modern story-telling, there are coincidences galore and reliance on people being uncommonly dense, but - hey! - it's a classic art form.

The actors were perfect, and drawn mostly from Joss Whedon's stable. Who knew that Alex Denisoff had an American accent?  And Amy Acker's sarcasm was perfect as Beatrice.

There were at least two stand-out moments. One was the physical comedy of Amy Acker, as she played Beatrice scuttling around trying to overhear Hero and the maid's gossip about Benedick's putative love for her.

The other was Nathan Fillion's comedy turn as Dogberry - an uncommonly dense police detective.

My one problem with Branaugh's version was what I perceived to be overacting. Then a friend who was a theater arts major explained why I didn't like it. It wasn't a movie, per se. It was a stage play which had been filmed. The actors were acting for the stage, making sure their performances and emotions got across to the cheap seats at the back of the second balcony.

This version doesn't have that problem. This is, in a very real sense, a movie. They are acting for a camera, and an audience which will never be very far from the action onscreen.

5687893,5,B00C2A4SYA,"I am, to the bone, a sci-fi geek and I love almost everything that Joss Whedon has done. So, when I got a post from a friend that Mr. Whedon had directed a Shakespeare play, I was very intrigued.

Much Ado About Nothing is a funny, fast paced play that had a bit of a scandal in it.  I'm not going to give away anything of the play itself but the fact that this is what these people do for fun occasionally on the weekends makes it awesome. The whole cast will be familiar to anyone who is familiar with Whedon's TV and film work prior to his Marvel Comic movies.  Even if Shakespeare isn't your thing, this film might be an exception worth making.",1432598400,,648,4.168
5687894,4,B00C2A4SYA,"To modernize Shakespeare is not always the best guarantee the depth of such a light comedy will be kept and even amplified. In this case the set is a real labyrinth, house and gardens, and we are sort of lost in all these corridors and rooms, bedrooms, kitchen, living rooms that are constantly, on all sides communicating, making any privacy impossible. But we get used to it.

The plot is more or less kept but princes, lords, counts and other noble people in modern garb in the modern world with cars and mammoth fridges and all modern comfort and commodities sound slightly folkloric. But here too we get used to it.

That was a comedy and still is, especially since the private cops are pathetic when they protest because they are called asses, which is not really an insult since they are nothing but mules for their princes and other noble people. But what about the rest of the plot?

Two young women. One wants to get married with a young man who at first is quite willing but some slandering goes on and the young man accuses the young woman of not being a maid any more. Love goes along with a lot of pain, as is well known. So she is announced as being dead after fainting in that tense situation, with the complicity of the local priest who was supposed to perform the wedding ceremony. We already know about that since we all know Romeo and Juliet. But it is a comedy. So everything will have to find some epiphany.

The second young woman is in love with a certain Benedict. But Benedict has sworn he will never marry, though that woman attracts him because she professes the idea that she will never marry. Never attracts never and two negatives make a positive. This young woman is the cousin of the first one and Benedict is intelligent enough to swear he is going to accuse and confront the man who she was to marry and who accused her falsely.

But no duel will take place because in the meantime the private security mules have been able to discover the plot and to arrest a couple who had been paid to spread the slandering rumor. So everything will end up well and they will be happy ever after. And two weddings in one day! Isn't that an achievement?

One of these comedies Shakespeare loved though the modern rewriting and shortening or densifying makes it a little bit easy, light, rather simple in a way. Apart from that lightness it is brilliantly set and performed though maybe slightly stiff as for the main Lord and clownish as for the private security asses. I must say too that the black and white made it nicely archaic and retrospective. Does the black and white add anything to the play? I am not sure but we get used to it.

But what is missing will you ask? Just the magic of the Renaissance, the distance in time that is not visible, hence we feel the stiffness of the nobility too much, especially when some are courting the maids, which is not courting but rather philandering. It sounds like ""A Sentimental Journey"" by Laurence Sterne. Slightly anachronistic.

5687917,5,B00C2A4SYA,"Joss Whedon (TV's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel,"" film's ""Marvel's Avengers"" and ""Toy Story"") breathes new life into this somewhat-under-the-radar take on Shakespeare's classic tale of love, loathing, and the thin line between them!

Set in a gorgeous present-day villa, filmed in black-and-white, and spoken in the original dialogue, the film is fresh and fun, but also able to stay true to the witty banter and original themes; this will help the more hesitant viewer feel more at ease with the prose and will still satisfy the diehard thespian. There were few deviations from the original but nothing that detracted too much from the play; the artistic license he takes give the story a bit more depth without sacrificing content.

Whedon fans will rejoice at a cast chock-full of his alums: Alexis Denisof, Amy Acker, Clark Gregg, and Nathan Fillion all have major roles, and all give excellent performances.

I seriously enjoy Shakespeare, his comedies in particular, but occasionally I find a production that leaves me cold.

5687952,5,B00C2A4SYA,"Joss Whedon shot this adaptation of the classic Shakespeare screwball comedy with a dark double plot on a shoestring budget, using his house as the backdrop.  For years, he has had Shakespeare reading parties with the casts of his TV shows and movies, and cast the movie from those reading parties.  The chemistry that comes from years of working together shows.  Shakespeare's iambic pentameter blank verse sounds totally free and natural, and works brilliantly in understandable American accents (showing you don't need to go Brit posh to do Shakespeare well).  Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof are fun to watch as Beatrice and Benedict, verbally sparring with crackling verve, doing hilarious physical screwball comedy in the scenes where they are fooled into thinking each loves the other, and showing a dark underside of fears of abandonment without spoiling the overall tenor of humor.  And the translation of Elizabethan ""Italy"" to a contemporary garden party in LA is worked out beautifully.  I particularly loved Nathan Fillion's aged football-frat-boy Dogberry, and Tom Lenk's clueless-sidekick Verges as particularly elegant adaptations, well executed.

I had thought for years that it would be impossible to top Kenneth Branagh's more period-influenced Much Ado, and while Emma Thompson is tough to top, I'd say that this presentation is terrific fun, and stands well as one of the great Shakespeare adaptations.",1424563200,5,1420,5.36936936936937

I don't mind the suits, the modern mansion setting, or the guns.  I thought the modern setting and filming it in black and white would serve as an interesting contrast to the drama of the play.  Nope.  Actor delivery is cold and bland, with stilted back-and-forths, and no energy!  Much Ado runs the full gamut of emotion, from true joy through deep despair, and there is none exhibited here.  The actors just kind of stand around and talk at each other, with very few exceptions.  It's almost like they're afraid to do something the same as one of Branaugh's characters would.

I don't get it.  It's not like Whedon isn't capable of leaping out of any comfort zone and transforming the material into a true modern interpretation.  He's got the goods and so do the actors.  They're all good actors!  What the hell happened?

Some of the funniest lines were left out while others that do not fit the modern scene are left in.  Conrade is made a woman, but still referred to as master, knave, man, sir, sirrah, and men.  And you can tell she hates being Conrade.  She smirks when it's not appropriate (even for the character), she looks at the camera during an ensemble scene, and you can tell she's bored out of her mind.  And where in the hell is Antonio?  They couldn't find anyone to play Leonato's brother?  Anything with him is cut out or re-directed to Leonato.  Strange.

I never thought I'd say this: Keanu Reeves was actually brilliant as Don John.  One thing I did like: the movie's version of Sigh No More.  It's light, sweet, and a little cheeky.  It's too bad the rest of the movie was bland.  Tragic.",1423094400,5,1798,4.503105590062112

Unfortunately, this movie did not make to theaters in my area and, although I would have driven 3.5 hours to New Orleans to see it, I waited too long hoping it would show up in local theaters.  I was very happy when it was finally release on DVD.",1421712000,,682,4.136363636363637

Whether Shakepeare would have approved of updated and transferred locales is something we shall never know.  Yet, the play has no such compromise in the use of language and in no way suffers from the translation, this bringing an immediacy to the material for a younger generation.",1421539200,,360,5.155172413793103
5687965,5,B00C2A4SYA,"I loved this version of this play. I pretty much love everything Joss Whedon does, Buffy the Vampire Slayer is one of my favorite shows of all time, we were all robbed of more Firefly and Captain Mal, and The Avengers is easily one of the best movies ever. I'm not a huge fan of the language Shakespeare uses, although it is beautiful to listen to, I feel it is easy to get lost in the words. Just a few minutes of watching this movie and there was no problem following the dialogue. Not only is Whedon a directorial genius, adding the right pieces of comedy at just the right moment while still bringing all the intensity to the more serious moments of the film, but he did it all in 12 days, in his own house, with his friends, how amazing is that?
Aside from the brilliance of Joss Whedon, his Whedonites of Amy Acker, Alexis Denisof, Nathan Fillion, Fran Kranz and Clark Gregg are incredible! After watching Angel and even Dollhouse where Amy Acker's characters are more shy and subdued, I love seeing her become the outspoken character of Beatrice, and she does it so well. Fran Kranz brings such innnocence and sweetness to Claudio that I just wanted to give him a hug! Nathan Fillion, as usual, was absolutely hilarious. With Tom Lenk working with him, the two of them were one of the most entertaining parts of the film. But I think the real star in this is Clark Gregg, he was so delightful to watch. He was fun and charming, and still showed the seriousness of the drama. Whedon perfectly cast this film, and knows how to tell a story! I was just glad he couldn't kill anyone!
Another masterpiece from Joss Whedon, nothing less than what I expected.",1421539200,,1659,4.4605263157894735

5687989,4,B00C2A4SYA,"Joss Whedon's adaptation of Much Ado About Nothing is safe.  If you are watching this to understand Shakespeare's play for school, or something, than this is a good way to go.  If you are watching simply for entertainment value, there are a lot of better adaptations.

  You take a big risk when you do Shakespeare; even bigger if you try to make a modern adaptation for Shakespeare.  Most people have very strong feelings one way or the complete opposite on the spectrum for Shakespeare's work.  If you are staying true to the scripts then making a modern adaptation can be a disaster.  This one was not terrible, but it also took no risks.

  The acting, however, was spectacular.  I loved Amy Acker as Beatrice.  She had a perfect balance of disagreeable, neurotic, and contriteness.  I've seen her in a couple of other things which are way out of this genre (agents of shield, warehouse 13, etc.) so I was pleasantly surprised by her broad spectrum of acting abilities.  She was almost a bit too charming, but pulled of the character quite well throughout.

  Alexis Denisof really surprised me as Benedick.  He's been in a lot of things, but I recognized him as the idiot Sandy Rivers From How I Met Your Mother.  This was a total different role, and he played it off quite well.  I also think he was the only actor to really take liberties with the character.  He didn't stray from the script (at least not from my little knowledge of Shakespeare), but his expressions gave a more pensive portrayal of Benedick instead of the classic Benedick who is constantly performing for the sake of others around him.

  I love Nathan Fillion in everything.  I first took note of him in Serenity (probably my all-time favorite Sci-Fi film). I think Michael Keaton was my favorite Dogberry, but Fillion held his own playing the dim-witted constable.

  In all, the movie was well acted, and true to the script.  Whedon took very little risks, but that might have been what helped pull off the modern adaptation.  At least he wasn't calling guns swords and daggers like some remakes of the master's plays .:;Coughes...Baz Luhrmann::.  Don't get me wrong, I loved Moulin Rouge, The Great Gatsby, and Strictly Ballroom, but Romeo + Juliet was just bad.  Sorry Mr. Luhrmann.",1418601600,,2264,4.737789203084833

That said, leads Amy Acker and Alexis Denisov do very nice work as Beatrice and Benedick, and Shakespeare's lines come across perfectly well in a contemporary setting. Most of the other parts are played by respected actors from good television series; one example is Nathan Fillion, who gives his usual light-hearted touch to the bumbling Constable. He plays the part straight, making it hilarious. If you've seen the Emma Thompson/Kenneth Branagh production, this is very different; but it respects the words and the story, and I would watch it again.",1416355200,,769,4.870229007633588

(This may be biased by expectations, having heard that this was the best Shakespearian movie adaptation ever.) I thought the principle actors were weak and not very interesting. Joss Whedon, famous for his strong female characters, made Amy Acker as Beatrice seem very weak indeed. Nathan Fillion, while passable, drew his strength from the absolutely brilliant (and underappreciated) performance of Tom Lenk. And I do have a new respect for Clark Gregg's abilities, which I think I have underestimated in the past.

5688097,4,B00C2A4SYA,"The touchstone by which all literature is judged, Shakespeare has never been as accessible as his genius demands.
Every school worthy of the title should have a mandatory class on the bard.  It should be part of graduation requirements
like minimum math and English scores.

That said, I am the first to admit that the teaching of Shakespeare has never been successfully done in the public schools because those who get the job are the last people you want having it.  This film is an example of someone who got it right.

Well paced, well shot, with actors who seem to understand the material, this is a modern day telling of a story that is still being re-done 500 years after it was penned.  That is the genius of Shakespeare.  That is what should be taught.  The universality of the story, not the difference in language use.

Joss Whedon has filmed this as Lifetime movie written by a really good author.  The setting is today, the people all those you see everywhere.  Love, confusion, betrayal, all contemporary themes and all accessible to any audience.  Whendon then does unthinkable, he blocks the movie in a contemporary style.  This is not a bloated cathedral to an iconic figure, Victorian era drawing room Shakespeare.  The characters are approachable, real people, the situations exaggerated for comedic effect, the satirical lines delivers with the serious tone of a Abrahams,  Zucker, Zucker film.  All elements blended together to present a good introduction to classic literature and entertainment.

That all said, it IS Shakespeare in the original language which is 500 years old.  As you laugh at one line you miss the next three, so repeated watching will allow you to get more and more of the story.  This was not dumbed down for today's audience.  YOU have to make an effort, but you will be rewarded.",1408060800,,1825,4.829032258064516

I thoroughly enjoyed watching Alexis Denisof stretch himself around Shakespeare, or as my grandaughter calls him, Willie Shakes. What do these kids learn in college. Anyway, Alexis was in almost every scene and universally wonderful in all of them. Amy Acker was no surprise as Beatrice. She brought all of her very fine talent to bear on the character and made you care for her and her pain. And you can't ever get enough of Nathan Fillion who got the most out of Dogberry. What a wonderful pairing of actor and character. He was made for that part. Almost everyone was solid and believable. The one sour note for me was Riki Lindhome. She was so lifeless in every scene but one that she tended to suck the energy out of the scenes she was in.",1407283200,,884,4.363636363636363

My favorite things?

1. The setting is BRILLIANT. The implied ""mob boss"" flavor to the Prince and his brother. The fact that everyone is basically drunk the entire time - suddenly the harebrained schemes actually make sense!

2. Fran Kranz plays the very first Claudio I didn't want to strangle with my bare hands. The not-too-bright, kicked-puppy vibe is the most sympathetic interpretation of the character I've ever seen. Now I understand why Hero goes back to him in the end. (There. That was the spoiler.)

3. Nathan Fillion's Dogberry is unlike any I've ever seen. I bought it 100% - who knew he didn't need to be an over-the-top caricature in order to be funny...and even poignant?

The rest of the cast (so many familiar faces for a dyed-in-the-wool Whedonite to squee over! Plus Youtube stars! Such fun, much whee) deliver strong performances, but I didn't feel any were out of the ordinary, over-the-top good. Just thoroughly enjoyable to watch.

5688122,2,B00C2A4SYA,"Most of the other 1-star reviews here have already said it all, but it bears repeating: DISAPPOINTING!  I love to see Shakespeare brought to the screen and am grateful for any attempts to do so (even Kenneth Branagh's ill-conceived As You Like It-meets-""Shogun"" version and Peter Greenway's 'Prospero's Books') and I enjoy modernized versions as well, Baz Lurhman's ""Romeo + Juliet"" being the best.  But as others noted, this Much Ado just made no sense.  Are they FBI agents back from a big arrest?  What ""war"" are they back from?  I was okay with the black & white, but it's as if the director deliberately tried to drain all life and color out of this brilliant comedy.  The lines are spoken with no passion, as if being read by a high school drama team.  The domestic urban setting and quick cuts from room-to-room catching couples snogging made this feel more like ""The Big Chill"" than Shakespeare.  Anyone attempting to match Michael Keaton's immortal Dogberry from the Branagh version better work really hard, and again this version's Dogberry is just flat.  There is one shining exception to the dullness: the magical poolside party version of the early masked ball.  This scene was the only one with any significant music in a film otherwise almost without any soundtrack at all - just lines delivered in silence.  2 stars at least for going to the effort to make a fresh version that's faithful to the text, and for the delightful masked ball scene.",1406419200,3,1459,4.796

I personally liked the casting - Acker was a great Beatrice and Denisof was a good foil for her as Benedick. Yes, there are subtle and not so subtle changes, all of which were justifiable in my opinion and they just add another interpretation that some will like and some won't. And again personally I loved the black and white cinematography.

Which would have been fine if that didn't mean that some of the language was left feeling confused because of it. If there had been some minor changes with the language as simple as a few word changes it would have made more sense. Other than that, the only minor issue I had was that the actors clearly weren't as comfortable with the language as some other renditions are, they have the basic understanding, which saves it from being unwatchable, but it lacks the fluid grace that creates a natural feel when the actors truly understands what they are say.",1405296000,,795,4.489655172413793

5688150,5,B00C2A4SYA,"You do not generally think Joss Whedon when you think of Shakespeare, but this movie turned out to be my favorite recent Shakespearean adaption.  It even gives Branagh version (which I love) a run for it's money.  Actually, in a few ways I prefer this version to the Branagh version.  In this version Dogberry is actually funny as opposed to just being utterly bizarre, which is how Michael Keaton played him (ridding an invisible horse?). Nathan Fillion did a great job of making the character just enough of a buffoon to be funny without going overboard.  He basically plays him as an idiot small town cop who has watched one too many episodes of CSI Miami, which completely works for the character.  I thought Sean Maher was also better as Don John then Keanu Reeves.  Amy Acker is great as Beatrice, she even rivals Emma Thompson. She kills the ""Oh that I were a Man..."" speech.  I wasn't a hundred percent sold on Alexis Denisof as Benedick at first.  In the beginning of the film the Shakespearean language just doesn't seem to come as naturally out of his mouth as it does the rest of the actors.  In all fairness this simply might be because I was kind of distracted that Wesley was speaking in an American accent.  Yes, I know that it's Denisof's actual accent, but I'm only familiar with him from Buffy and Angel, so it's jarring for me.  In any case, as the film went on I feel that he became more and more comfortable and by the time the scene where he challenges Claudio comes around he owns it (he is also really good in the ""Kill Claudio"" scene, he just has less to do than Acker)  Actually, I think he was excellent in all the dramatic scenes throughout (though most of them come towards then end), maybe he just does Shakespearean drama better than comedy.  Though his physical comedy was very good.  He and Acker do have great chemistry (which they've always had), which is key for the play to work at all.

Much Ado about Nothing, has always been one of my favorite plays by Shakespeare.  This adaption did not disappoint in the slightest.  In fact, I think it will be hard to top.  It's going to be the stick that I measure all modern adaptions by for a long time.",1404777600,,2184,4.458438287153652

5688152,5,B00C2A4SYA,"This was an excellent movie. It is masterfully acted! Watch the little responses on each actor's face...even the ones who are just supporting roles in a given scene. They are delightful and add so much to the mood and the meaning.

The filming is also wonderful. The camera angles do much to add to the absurdity of some scenes, but I also enjoyed that. This is one of Shakespeare's comedies, after all.

In truth, I never have read Much Ado About Nothing before. Perhaps those reviewers who thought this rendition sacreledge knew and loved the original story too well to appreciate a modernized rendition. Granted, there are a number of plot twists that seem rather absurd when set in the modern world. However, I'm unconvinced that in Shakespeare's time these story twists would have made more sense. Shakespearean comedies are all about the farce, and that comes through remarkably well in this movie. The movie forces you to see how Shakespearean drama would have played in scenes and settings that feel like one's own time, and I loved imagining all the non-elites standing on the floor of the Globe Theater laughing at the silliness of these lords and ladies.

One last comment about the language: there are many words fired in rapid succession. I don't think I realized earlier quite how banal and slow-paced most movie/tv dialogue has become. In contrast to this movie, one's wit is hardly challenged or expanded through listening to our entertainment choices today. While this movie may be a challenge for many, it really was worth the effort. I am sure I missed many of the quips, but after awhile, one starts to grasp the meaning without trying to...kind of the way people start to hear past a strong accent after a while and comprehend the meaning.

Give this movie a shot, because it is a great example of what entertainment can be when it is also art.",1404777600,,1865,4.764705882352941

5688203,5,B00C2A4SYA,What a great adaptation. Proof that less production can bring so much more. This version simply lets the beautifully acted language tell the story.

That being said, this movie was fantastic!  I was really impressed by the range of Amy Acker as Beatrice, whom I had only really seen play amoral killers previously.

Wheadon made this version so much fun to watch! I highly recommend it.

It's very intelligent (of course), sexy in parts, and sensual throughout, due in part to the wonderful cinematography (which I think only benefits from the use of black and white).

5688255,5,B00C2A4SYA,"This is a wonderful adaption. I saw it in theaters and I utterly adored it.
I loved that it was all filmed at Joss Whedon's house. Not because it's his house, but because filming it in the single location gave it almost the feel of the set of a play.

And what the hell was with the opening scene of Beatrice and Benedict in bed? What are we supposed to make of that? Reality? A dream? And if a dream who was having it? WTF?
A lot of missing dialogue from the true versions.
And you can't convert this story to modern day times without changing the dialogue. Cars? Smart phones? Suits? 9 mm pistols? Sunglasses?
""I would my horse had the speed of your tongue.""
Who the hell has a horse let alone rides one today?
How about ""I would my car, or motorcycle, had the speed of your tongue."" ?
Seriously, if they were going try to make this work in modern society they should have canned all the flowery language altogether and converted all the dialogue to how people really speak now.

I disagree with the other comments about wooden acting, I thought most of the acting was very well done, and Nathan Fillion was perfect in his role as Dogberry. I especially liked seeing Alexis Denishof and Amy Acker as the main love interests since they interact so well with each other.

My favourite scenes involved the eavesdropping; it's worth watching just for Acker's and Denishof's skills. I won't spoil the scene by describing it.",1401408000,,562,5.108695652173913

Nathan Fillian steals the show as the ""ass"" of a bumbling security man.  Despite some of the cultural awkwardness (we don't generally think of fathers and power players setting up arranged marriages quite this overtly), the overall result served to emphasize how much of human nature hasn't changed.",1401408000,,438,5.069444444444445

5688271,2,B00C2A4SYA,"I kept watching this against my judgment, thinking so many reviewers couldn't be wrong. But it failed to capture me, partly due to the lackluster acting. The main actors just didn't seem to have any feeling for or understanding of what they were saying. I would prefer to watch a high-school play than this version. It makes me wonder: is it the suits, the setting, the lifestyle shots that are really drawing people in? If so, Shakespeare in a modern setting has been done and redone before, and often better than this. Please, please do watch the Branagh-Thompson version before you cast your vote. That version has skilled actors, hilarious comedy and vivid scenery and will truly illuminate your understanding of what Shakespeare can be.",1401235200,5,741,4.936

My husband and I both agreed afterwards, however, that it was not quite as good as the Branagh version. I don't think I'll watch it again, but it definitely wasn't a waste of our time.

The acting is generally poor and the delivery of Shakespeare's words is juvenile -- generally on par with something you'd see at a Community College (not to insult Community Colleges, it's just that these actors are supposed to be professionals and not students).  The costumes are awful -- all the men where suits that make them look alike so you can't tell the social distinctions very well at all and the humor behind them in the play gets lost.  It's overall a very dreary and uninspired interpretation of a great play.

I heard a lot about it, and the promo looked great.  I have to say that the first half hour or so lays the foundation for the fun that takes place thereafter.  It takes a while to get used to the English prose, not much was happening, and I was wondering if it would get better.  Trust me, it does!  Stick with it.  There are great payoffs.

Creating scenes without variation in the lines is always a struggle. As in the written copies of the plays there are no stage directions. This causes the most confusion in following the plot for people unfamiliar with the language.

5688305,5,B00C2A4SYA,"I have anticipated enjoying Joss Whedons adaption of William Shakespeares Much Ado About Nothing from the first time I heard about it in 2011 and then being reminded of it this past summer when the Belcourt Theater showed it. My anticipation was rewarded so that I did not mind driving to Clarksville on a day that was not in my typical schedule.
When Joss Whedon does something, he does it well. This piece of artistry was not thrown together in any fashion. The film was thought out and planned very well, which allowed the shooting to be only 12 days.
The actors assumed the characters with great fluidity. Amy Acker was an excellent Beatrice, to the point that she was one of the actors that I did not recognize immediately. Acker embraced the wit and charm the role that Beatrice possessed and made it her own. The chemistry between Acker and Alexis Denisof was perfection; Denisof made a wonderful Benedick.
There were other familiar faces within the film from Whedons prior works, but the familiarity did not distract from the play. I believe that is because of the quality of actors. The focus was on the character in the play instead of the name in the credits.
The scenes drew the audience in as the classroom watched. There were moments of laughter and moments of tears while viewing the film. While the majority of those at the viewing were either Shakespeare fans or Joss Whedon fans, the quality of the film still spoke through and touch the audience. Had the production been done poorly, the audience would not have been drawn in as well and there would not have been as much interest originally.
There were key points for me that as a viewer I loved. The first set of scenes were when Beatrice and Benedick were eavesdropping on conversations finding out how the other one allegedly felt about them. Benedick jumping all over the place and pretending to be invisible was quite humorous. Beatrice in her own right was rather sneaky in hiding, although hitting her head under the counter had to have hurt.
Also enjoyed the second wedding when __ marries Hero's cousin, which is actually Hero. I am a softy when it comes to happy endings.
I appreciated that Whedon stayed true to the original writing of Much Ado, in doing so, he proved that it is possible to keep the original script and modernize the setting successfully. While Whedon did modernize the play, he did not make it an abomination.
Using the black and white film conveyed an artistic approach, while also allowing continuity in the set. Because the film was done on a very limited budget, there had to be some short cuts. Black and white film allowed the concern of color to not be as high on the list. I imagine painting a house or making sure an entire wardrobe coordinating can be quite expensive. The black and white also kept the play nostalgic within the modernization.",1400630400,,2853,4.673956262425447

5688312,3,B00C2A4SYA,"Joss Whedon presents a quickie version of a great Shakespeare comedy, Much Ado About Nothing (or Noting, which is Elizabeth for eavesdropping).  An A-level amateur version of this play, at times reminding me of a high-school production, which is not a bad thing.  After all, if you start watching great Shakespearean performances you may become lost.  This humble production is accessible, which is the best thing it has going for it.  I wonder why Whedon chose black and white for a comedy?  I think it was a bit of mistake. The casting isn't perfect, but it works.  For my money, this is a good, not great version.

Best version: if you can find it, Sam Waterston and Kate Nelligan as Benedict and Beatrice.  Great modern Shakespeare adaptations?

5688317,5,B00C2A4SYA,"It is hard to imagine that this was filmed in twelve days, but it is true. It is impossible not to compare Whedons take to Branaghs. Amy Acker is a hilarious Beatrice. Branaghs Benedick just cannot be beaten (sorry, Alexis Denisof), but My wife and I think Ms. Acker outclassed Emma Thompsons Beatrice, which is no mean feat.

Michael Keatons Dogberry leaves Nathan Filion in the dust, but Filion gave it an excellent go. Denzel Washington was a poor choice for Branaghs Don Pedro, and Keanu Reeves has no business doing Shakespeare (I do not mean that as an insult). Sean Maher was a far better Don John.

I cannot choose a better one between these two adaptations. They each have virtues. We may perhaps give Branagh the nod as a better director of Shakespeare, but Joss Whedons offering is an unexpected pleasure. See both of them, which will hardly be a waste of time, and decide for yourself.",1400544000,,897,4.635220125786163

Arranged marriages, maidenhood, duels, and princes don't do well in a modern vacation house. Being neither cutting edge or classic, it misses the mark.

Adjust your mind to the modern setting, and maybe check up on the names of the characters online or in a printed version of the play before watching this adaptation, because the characters' names and roles can be a bit confusing if you don't remember the original plot. Otherwise the play moves like a modern comedy and is very pleasant to watch.

I knew what to expect in terms of production values so I was not put off by it when watching, but understand that this was filmed inside some guy's house with a bunch of his actor friends. Granted, we are talking about Joss Whedon here but this is exactly the look and feel of the film.

When the acting is good, its really good. I am really surprised by some familiar faces from TV and seeing them pull off natural and believable Shakespeare. I am also grateful they didn't resort to fake English accents and remained true to the setting (contemporary LA). It was fun to see a fat Nathan Fillion, he's obviously doing well. And getting large!

But when the acting is bad, it is terrible. Benedict was a horrible, boring, trite Benedict. And a lot of the supporting cast is dialing it in.

But the principals, Clark Gregg, Amy Acker, Fran Kranz, Sean Maher and others are fantastic.

I enjoyed this production so much that I immediately planned to watch it again, which I have done.  And yet, I plan to see it again.

I can't recommend 'Much Ado About Nothing' enough.  This should be shown in every high school lit class, and in every home of any Shakespeare lover.  Enjoy....",1400112000,,672,4.3983739837398375
5688347,1,B00C2A4SYA,"This rendition of ""Much Ado"" seems to be hastily thrown together with very ado to some pretty basic elements to the story.  ***Warning, some spoilers***

The play is set in Joss Whedon's house and it doesn't really deviate at all from this locale.  Whedon was able to get the place on the cheap...it being his... and only had the minor setback of having the police called on him one day of shooting when the block was cordoned off so that we wouldn't see cars going by.  Added to the extreme headaches of the filming, Whedon also explained in the screenplay book that I purchased that construction was going on in the house next door.  This also caused some issues with when they filmed.

Sigh.

One of the basic elements of ""Much Ado"" is that it is funny.  Tremendously so.  It is one of my favorite Shakespearean plays.  This rendition is not funny at all.  I am hard pressed to really find much to laugh at throughout the play.  Even the hilarious scene with Dogberry and Verges is slapped with a wet noodle.  Those parts are written so well, however, that I had to smile at the lines...albeit the performances that fell flat.  For me, Nathan Fillion's Dogberry is the highlight of an otherwise dim attempt at Shakespeare.

Hardly a Shakespeare traditionalist snob, I will say that overall, I am never too enamored with modern day interpretations.  But this one simply makes no sense.  The modern day here is essentially that the men walk around in suits and ties throughout the play.  They decide to stay for a month at this suburban house with Leonato...for who knows what reason.  They are all packing pistols.  For who knows what reason.  They came back from...war?  Doesn't really say that.  They are the finest dressed soldiers one has ever seen and none of them seem to be so worn from battle fatigue that they would need a month to hole up in some suburban chalet, but I digress.

The modern day element of showing up in a car with guns and suits makes a number of lines problematic:

""I wish my horse had the speed of your tongue"" - no horse.
""By my sword Beatrice, I love thee"" - no sword, he has a glock

The opening scene of the play is a feeble and failed attempt by Joss Whedon to ""modernize"" the play.  He shows a couple in bed.  The man arises and puts on his clothes and goes to the door.  The naked woman lies on her side, awake but playing as if she is still asleep.  An overly dramatic pause at the door, a look and the ""gentleman"" leaves...thus leading me and the audience to horrifyingly discover that this would be Benedick and Beatrice.  Whedon argues that this modern day interpretation seems ""entirely valid"".  He as going for the tone of intimacy between the two that they were ""meaningful"" and ""intimate"" and ""open about their relationship"".  Complete and utter crap in my opinion.  The modern day interpretation is that it is a one night stand and that Benedick is slinking out to get away because he doesn't WANT intimacy!  In the play, the idea is that these two kindred spirits really did love one another but could not commit because they were so much alike.  They were at odds with each other because Beatrice is a strong woman who will never back down to a fight.  The idea that she would simply play possum and fake being asleep whilst her love left forever is ridiculous.

Later Whedon, admittedly, casts Riki Lindhome as Conrad, Don John's attendant.  Don John is feeling up Conrad in a make out scene, which just confuses the hell out of me.  Later, when being examined, Joss forgot to take out several lines where Dogberry examines Borrachio and Conrad and he refers to them as ""sirs"" and to Conrad specifically as ""sir"".  Her breasts bely the obvious mistake and it doesn't serve as any kind of comical element in that perhaps Dogberry is such the fool that he can't recognize that she is a female.  Whedon, ever the artist, said that he thought that he liked the idea of getting more women into the play and that, quote, ""it's a way to have more sex"".  A modern day genius.

This is not a play to be compared to the Kenneth Branagh version of ""Much Ado"" in any realm other than to serve as a counterpoint to how Shakespeare CAN be done well and how it can be butchered, ruined and slapped on a spit.  To see one after the other is to provide the viewer with the most extreme examples of any two films based on the same script.  It hardly seems fair.  So many actors in Branagh's rendition gave amazing and memorable performances: Emma Thompson as Beatrice was phenomenal.  Michale Keaton as Dogberry was a scream.  Even Denzel Washington acquitted himself quite well, while Branagh was simply amazing.  The only actor noticeably out of place was Keanu Reeves...but even that seemed plausible because he was playing the prince's bastard brother and was shunned by the fleet for this fact....Today we do not begrudge those born out of wedlock.  So this tidbit in Whedon's ""Much Ado"" is yet another foible in this modern day comedy of errors",1400112000,19,4983,4.548931383577053
5688348,5,B00C2A4SYA,"In muted black and white, this film forms an intimate and understated counterpoint to the more lavish and over-the-top style of  Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet or even Branaugh's own Much Ado and Midsummer Night's Dream.  Filmed in  a comfortable modern estate in what appears to be a ritzy neighborhood of L.A., the cast is clearly enjoying themselves, and the audience is invited into their revelry for a gentle dinner party of a movie.  Whedon and Marvel fans will recognize many of the faces here, and the easy cameraderie of the cast contributes to the warm glow of the movie. Filled with laugh-out-loud moments, this lovely adaptation is witty, funny, heartwarming, and (at just the right moments) heart-wrenching.  Watch with a cherished friend or lover on a spring or summer night, and prepare to fall in love with the setting, the characters, the delightful turns of phrase, and each other.",1400112000,,896,4.9865771812080535

5688350,4,B00C2A4SYA,"I have enjoyed this story since the older version was made, and they did a wonderful job of taking Shakespeare to a modern setting. Good casting for the parts. It's a story of love, betrayal, revenge and happiness. Go ahead, brush of the old style english and watch it.",1400025600,,269,4.510204081632653
5688351,5,B00C2A4SYA,"While some people make harsh comparisons between books and film versions, or between different film version of literary source material, I tend to take a different approach. I love ""Much Ado"" from a literary perspective, and having it performed in different ways allows me to enjoy it again and again in different ways. In Wheadon's film, the finished product is stripped down to essentials, low budget, black and white. It removes the ""period piece"" trappings and places it in a modern residential environment, where there are cars even parked outside the home. But what emerges is all Bard, and maybe even more so, due to the removal of the usual lavish period frosting. Offsetting the lack of set expense is more physical comedy and consequently more riding on the actors to splash upon us the splendid and sometimes ridiculously giddy prose of this comedic masterpiece. The main protagonists are wonderful, but what really stands out is the dialog, which is the point of a Shakespeare work.

So, is it better than the 1993 Branagh film? Sigh...do I like a great mushroom and cheddar burger more than lettuce tomato, muenster cheese and onion burger? They are different and I truly love them both. And having both available keeps me from getting tired of either.",1400025600,,1265,4.938967136150235
5688352,5,B00C2A4SYA,It's amusing to see all these actors that you've seen in Joss Whedon's  action thrillers. But they all do a creditable job with Shakespeare. Of course when you work with Joss Whedon you're accustomed to good dialogue. One must presume this is a labor of love.

5688355,5,B00C2A4SYA,"I loved, loved, loved this movie.

First, I should admit that I am an all-things-Joss fangirl - it started, for me, with Firefly (years, of course, after it originally aired), and continued on to Buffy, Angel, Dollhouse, Dr. Horrible, and now Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  I think the treatment Whedon brings to his scripts and his characters is unique and special and as far as I am concerned, he can do no wrong.

That being said, Much Ado was absolutely brilliant.  It's a modern-day adaptation of the Bard's comedic play, filmed entirely at Joss' home in California over the course of 12 days, and is packed with old friends as cast members.  We have Nathan Fillion as the very funny Dogberry, Amy Acker as the sharp-tongued Beatrice, a gorgeously scruffy Alexis Denisof as Benedick, Reed Diamond as Don Pedro, Clark Gregg as Hero's father, Leonato, and Sean Maher as the scurrilous Don John, among others.  There's a bit of gender switching (Shakespeare would approve!), and a few roles are consolidated into that of Leonato's aide, but the heart of the play shines through brilliantly, nonetheless.

The language is all Shakespeare; that is the only thing that takes a bit of getting used to, if one is not used to speaking Olde English on a regular basis.  Within the first ten minutes, though, my brain had adapted to the unfamiliarity of the speech, and I was thoroughly enjoying the witty blows between Beatrice and Benedick, and cursing Don John and his nasty machinations against Hero and Claudio.  Even though I was previously acquainted with the play, I still felt anxious for the conclusion; of course, my anxiety was broken up somewhat by the shiny humor that Fillion brought to his character.  Dogberry's ineptitude and, at the same time, his sincerity, had me giggling often.  Also, at his own insistence, let it here be writ that ""he is an ass.""

If you've hesitated to watch Much Ado About Nothing for any reason, hesitate no more.  It is a glorious escape for a time, just as it is intended to be, and you will enjoy it.",1400025600,,2044,4.756373937677054

The black and white, the jazz music, gives it a magical appeal. I watched the Branagh version a long time ago and that version has its place. This one is the version to show to high schoolers learning Shakespeare for the first time, for Shakespeare lovers who wish to see this play in a refreshing setting, to film lovers who wish to see what is possible.

I have to commend almost every aspect of this film: to Whedon's direction, to the actors who all played their parts so pitch perfectly. Always loved Alexis Denisof and Amy Acker and they didn't disappoint. Sean Maher is deliciously evil (please note him taking a cupcake after his plans come to fruition; it was his own unscripted move!). Conrad being a woman makes so much sense.

Having seen many modern adaptations of various Shakespearean comedies and dramas, I was looking forward to seeing Whedon's take. Rather than adapting it in any way, he simply changed the setting, chose his favorite regular actors (whom I have enjoyed in other works), and dumped it in our laps.

It is trite, stilted, and out of sync, in the acting as well as setting. Rather than breathing new life into a wonderful old classic, it feels like the actors were phoning in the lines between photo-shoots and other bland daily activities. I got through about 10 painful minutes, before the cringing was unbearable.

5688416,2,B00C2A4SYA,"I was hesitant about this movie when I saw the trailer, but I decided to go for it after reading so many positive reviews.

The film is true to text, and all my favorite lines are there- but delivered with none of the sparkle such witty lines deserve! There is no chemistry between Beatrice and Benedick in my eyes. All the best comedic moments in the dialogue are whisked over as if the play were just being recited aloud in a read-through rather than actually acted.

I'm all for modernized versions of Shakespeare, I think it's a great opportunity to hear the beautiful language but also get a better grasp of the meaning when it's tied to a setting modern viewers can relate to. I recently watched a BBC version of Hamlet with David Tennant that did that really well. But I feel like the actors in Much Ado About Nothing make no effort to make the lines relatable to the setting and so the magic is lost. It's all the more disappointing because I don't understand why it didn't work. I know Joss Whedon is capable of witty dialogue.

I will say that I may be more critical because of how much I love the repartee between Beatrice and Benedick. It's like hearing someone tell your favorite joke and rush the punchline and you're left standing there thinking ""wait, everybody just missed how funny that line really is!

Amy Acker particularly shines and it's really a very, very good introduction for anyone put off by the more ""classic"" versions.

The actors and actresses did a very good job presenting the old Shakespearean language while making it understandable and believable. Not sure the black and white was necessary. It seemed almost pretentious. Just because something is B&W doesn't make it artistic, classical, or good. I was also a little confused about the unbelievable amount of alcohol consumption in the movie. Maybe it was supposed to be a statement, but to me it was a little distracting.

If you're not already a Shakespeare buff, I'd recommend reading a brief synopsis of the play beforehand, or at least reading the list of characters so you won't struggle to figure out who is who and what they're talking about because the visuals give little context to what's going on.",1392422400,,815,4.821428571428571

5688430,5,B00C2A4SYA,"Other reviewers have written extensively on the acting (love/hate) the directing & post production work (love/hate) and the use of the actual script. (I find it amusing that one reviewer denigrated ""Much Adu..."" as ""one of Shakespeare's weaker works."") - apparently even surviving as a popular, regularly performed work for a couple hundred years doesn't buy credibility with some critics. Shakespeare may have done better, but few others have!)

Here's my personal summary for the over 50 crowd:

If you are looking for ""Ethel and the Pirates,"" with colorful period costumes, huge location and set budgets, sweeping English vistas, and with dialog translated 200 years forward from Shakespeare's finely tuned word play into boisterous 21st century Americans shouting and laughing at each other, then THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR YOU.

However, if you like good acting, a spirited, creative, fresh view of a great work of comedy that has been crafted with evident skill and performed by actors obviously present and having a great time, you'll like this. If you like the freshness of theater, that slight feeling of risk that things might not go just perfectly but it will be gotten through anyway, then likely you'll love it.

Acting: All very good, most excellent.
Dialog delivery: good clear delivery of Shakespearean English. A pleasure to listen to.
Physical ""bits"": Shakespeare wrote in a way that allows great physical humor and expression with a good cast and a talented director. Be it shoulder-clasping, snooping about outside a window, or a slapstick constable, this movie has the right mix and execution of physical humor and body language. For me it brought forth memories of great stage performances I've seen everywhere, from high school stages (which some reviewers apparently don't think could EVER do Shakespeare well, ) to the Kennedy Center. Yet it remained true to the modern setting; no small feat.

In short:
My wife and I LOVED Much Ado about Nothing. Best movie we've seen in months.",1391904000,,2001,5.107033639143731
5688431,4,B00C2A4SYA,"I very much enjoyed seeing my favorite Joss Whedon stars performing this adaptation of Shakespeare's Much Ado about Nothing.

We kept expecting the movie to turn from black & white to color but it never happened and that was OK. It was also slightly jarring seeing how modern things were with the archaic language but after a brief adjustment we had no problems adapting. Benedict and Beatrice were both likable and had their extremely silly moments.

When watching we initially teased about the amazing soundtrack (which at first was just irregular plinking noises) but that too picked up.

Also, we were amazed at how much alcohol was consumed and just generally present (in pretty much every single scene).",1391904000,,709,4.991525423728813
5688432,4,B00C2A4SYA,"Joss Whedon's take on Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing was refreshing and hilarious at times. The casting was genius nad it was great to see actors from various Whedon Universes come together and not see them as the characters they were known for playing beforehand. The cinematography was well planned as was the blocking of the characters. He took the subtext of the lines and let them shine through in movement and in picture. You could truly watch it on mute and know what was going on in the moment.

The Casting of Beatrice and Benedick was a great idea. Alexis Denisof played Benedict in a mesmeric comedic way that he should be played. Heightening  the drama through comedy. Amy Acker plays one of my favorite Shakespearean characters in the best manor possible.  She is strong, proud, kind, and gentle. The genius casting has to go to Nathan Fillion and Tom Lenk. Their chemistry together was phenomenal. I want to see them in many other situations together.

My only harsh critique of the film is the cutting of the few Dogberry scenes that were cut.",1391904000,,1064,4.735135135135135

Historically, my least favorite character in the play is Dogberry (I don't care for most of Shakespeare's clowns), but Nathan Fillion actually makes the idiot believable (not to single NF out, because everyone is great).

Set in modern times, with modern backgrounds, props and costumes, yet sticking to the original script and dialect, this production was a wonderful melding of modern and classic.  Joss Weadon's casting, with actors he has worked with in the past, was a delight.  I enjoyed seeing actors from other movies and TV productions of Mr. Weadon brought together on this project.  I think that added to the chemistry of the actors and lent itself very well to the feeling of kinship and familiarity among the players.  Mr. Weadon is very good at infusing his productions with humor and this was no different.  I laughed out loud many times.  Be prepared if you aren't a Shakepeare fan...The dialect is the original.  If you aren't aware of that, and aren't prepared for it, you are going to be left behind.  The English language was a ponderous thing in Shakespeare's time!

5688440,5,B00C2A4SYA,"A ""traditional"" production of ""Much Ado"" requires such a great deal of suspension of disbelief from a modern audience that it really doesn't require a whole lot more to see it updated to the present.  Some reviewers couldn't get past Shakespeare's language in the mouths of people with suits -- but already we've had McKellen's ""Richard III,"" Fiennes's ""Coriolanus,"" and the Brideshead ""Love's Labor's Lost.""  Really . . . it's not a huge problem any more, provided the language is naturally spoken.  Joss Whedon's cast does it very well, and this version of the play is as funny as and maybe even more moving than the famous Branagh version.  It's superior in two regards: Sean Maher is a much better Don John than Keanu Reeves, and the whole Dogberry part of the action is simply hilariously done and very economically integrated with the action, with Nathan Fillion outstanding.  In fact, the narrative drive all through is absolutely clear.  The decision to shoot in black and white indeed captures the ""noir"" undertone of the story and looks beautiful too.  And the house in which the action was filmed in twelve days turns out to be wonderfully apt in something of the same way as Branagh's Tuscan villa, with its arches, hiding places, and passages.

These actors were not known to me -- I understand that they are quite well known for TV work and from some of Whedon's other films.  They are splendid, and they seemed to be having a great time doing this play.  The important thing is that Whedon understands the play and knows what it takes to make it work, and he has got his cast to buy in to his understanding.

5688450,5,B00C2A4SYA,"Joss Whedon is known for his intelligent, witty dialog and the complex relationships he develops within characters, so to see him direct something he had no direct hand in writing the dialog for intrigued me. I am a huge Shakespeare nerd and this is Shakespeare done right. Joss proves his ability to adapt Shakespeare into a compelling modern film without changing the dialog.

The scenery is gorgeous, the actors' timing is impeccable, and the whole story is told with an ease, a gentleness that sets you in the house as part of the action.

5688459,4,B00C2A4SYA,"I really liked this movie. It was a neat visual spin on the classic telling. I really like the moderizaiton and the black and white. The characters I all recgonize and the actors who play them I seem to remember from every Joss Whedon production, however they all do a good job.
I was a big fan of the play and of the 1993 version of the play. This version, as I said is visually appealing, shortened,  and easier to follow if you don't speak 'Old English.'
I gave it four stars because a few of my favorite lines of the play did not make the cut of this film and a few times the actors underacted what they were saying.
But this is a great film to watch with a glass of wine!!",1389830400,,677,4.052238805970149
5688460,4,B00C2A4SYA,"One of the most popular and most absurd plays written by William Shakespeare is Much Ado About Nothing. The story is whimsical and the characters do quite ridiculous things. Audiences love it because it is full of joy, almost exploding with joy. It's easy to forgive the contrivances of the plot because the humor and the romance is so wonderful. The story follows a troop of men who return from battle to the home of Leonato where love is in the air. Claudio wants to marry Leonato's daughter Hero while Benedick and Beatrice have a ""merry war of words"" inspires their friends to make them fall in love too. Madcap hilarity ensues with occasional moment of dramatic intensity.

Joss Whedon made this film during a two-week break in the middle of making The Avengers. The actors are his friends, mostly from his previous TV shows. The set is his house and backyard. He'd been having friends over for Shakespeare readings for years and years, so it is not such a surprise that they could put something together quickly and still do a good job.

The actors are good if not always outstanding. Alexis Denisof (Benedict here; Wesley from Buffy and Angel) might be a little too buffonish at points but nails it in others; Amy Acker (Beatrice; Fred from Angel) does a great job and has natural chemist with Denisof; Nathan Fillion (Dogberry; Mal from Firefly) steals the show. As a fan of Whedon's previous work, it was a little distracting seeing all the different actors popping up. But I got used to it after a while, just like people get used to the Shakespearean language.

The black and white photography works well, giving it a style appropriate to the timelessness of the story. The story is ultimately relevant to generation after generation because it touches on truths and experiences that happen all the time because people are, in fact, people. We've all experienced unrequited loves, the joy of discovered love, the hope of a happy ending in even the craziest circumstances. Hopefully not this crazy.

Parental Advisory: All the characters drink quite a bit; a little bit of smoking (probably some weed); some frisky sex scenes without nudity; that difficult Shakespeare language.",1389744000,,2188,4.857908847184986
5688461,5,B00C2A4SYA,I was thrilled when I heard Joss got his friends together to do an impromptu filming of Much Ado at his house on his break from the Avengers (instead of taking vacation). Saw it in theaters and had to buy it. An amazing feat considering it was all filmed at Whedon's house in a month.,1389744000,,284,4.181818181818182
5688462,5,B00C2A4SYA,"This is a vibrant, engaged, and engaging adaptation.  Not all the actors seem to be equally comfortable speaking Shakespeare's lines but there are no poor performances, and Whedon and his cast do an excellent job of bringing out the humor without losing sight of the tension and pathos.  Amy Acker (Beatrice) is flawless and Clark Gregg (Leonato) is easy, fun, and casually brilliant.  Nathan Fillion is perfect as Dogberry -- earnest, ridiculous, and Fran Kranz is the best Claudio I've seen... mainly because he's the first Claudio that I didn't want to simply throttle because of the character's behavior and decisions.  The movie is filmed entirely in Whedon's own home and they use the layout, and the decor, to the best advantage, including anchoring this is the small and specific.  We see intimate angles and perspectives, not grand sweeping flourishes.
The adaptation also an interesting blend of modern and 'old.'  There are cars, cell phones, and contemporary fashion, but Whedon doesn't mess with anything beyond these surface trappings.  I think the film being in black and white help make that potentially disconcerting contradiction work.  It's not Romeo + Juliet or even the Richard III adaptation starring Ian McKellan, where the time shift is comprehensive.
My family and I really enjoyed this, and I am sure my students will too.  Oh, for anyone using this in an English class, you might want to look at the screenplay.  It's interesting to compare to the original text AND to the film as shot/edited.  There are some difference worth bringing up for class discussion.",1389657600,,1587,5.065384615384615

5688465,5,B00C2A4SYA,This movie is fantastic! Joss Whedon truly puled off a Shakespeare miracle with his version. Probably one of the best versions I have seen. It's like watching real life but with the added twist of Shakespearean dialogue. I watch it over and over again.,1389657600,,252,4.75
5688466,3,B00C2A4SYA,"Excellent Beatrice, so-so Benedict.  The contemporary setting added nothing to our understanding or appreciation of the characters.  It also tended to undermine the portrayal of Dogberry and the watch.

5688471,5,B00C2A4SYA,"Whedon's adaptation of this classic play was tremendous. Differing greatly from the film adaptation by Branagh, this new version smartly placed the characters in modern society. In many ways, I feel this version told the story of the characters far better than Branagh. The history of Benedick and Beatrice is readily apparent here. The choice to make Conrad a woman actually fit much better than leaving the character as a man. And the revelation that Boraccio is in love with Hero makes his plot-line flow much better as well. All in all, a great film, and I highly recommend it.",1389398400,,581,4.82
5688472,5,B00C2A4SYA,"Joss Whedon has out done himself. This movie is a great example of Whedon's style and creative genius, but above all, it honors the beautiful, crafty language and characters of The Bard. I use it to show my students that Shakespeare can be easily understood and how hysterical and relevant his work is!",1389398400,,302,4.716981132075472
5688473,3,B00C2A4SYA,"It's clear from the ""making of..."" feature that everyone involved in this production had fun. The idea of meeting at Joss Whedon's beautiful property for Shakespeare readings is wonderful. However, despite the self congratulatory comments of all involved, the production itself is mildly enjoyable and, as others have said, pretty lightweight. This production was more for the actors than for the audience. That's not a bad thing at all, especially if the viewer approaches the movie with this in mind.",1389312000,,502,5.2875

5688477,4,B00C2A4SYA,"If you like Shakespeare, this adaptation is true to the language of the original, just with an updated setting and some very good acting.  In fact the comedy is a bit funnier than the typical costume version, and the woe and misery is a little bit more woeful and miserable without the distraction of being set in Shakespeare's time.  I was surprised and pleased.",1389139200,,363,4.65625

5688479,5,B00C2A4SYA,"This is just a masterpiece, a modern take one of Shakespear's finest comedies. What sets it apart from most modern retallings of his work, is the use of Shakespearian dialogue. I think most true Whedon fans are Shakespear fans to begin with and will be extactic to see this film. The entire cast is just wonderful and there's many of Whedon regulars to please his fans, even in the smallest roles. The cast includes Alexis Denisof, Amy Acker, Clark Gregg, Fran Kranz, Reed Diamond, Tom Lenk, Nathan Fillion, Sean Maher, and Ashley Johnson and many other non-Whendon performers. All and all, a great film filled with comedy and romnce.",1389139200,,634,4.825688073394495

For those Firefly fans, there are a few faces that you will recognize, since this is a Joss Whedon production.  Well worth the $3.99 I rented it for.  I even watched it a second time with a friend.  You have a full 24 hours to view it before it is returned.  I would highly recommend Shakespeare fans to view this and also those people who aren't so familiar with his plays will find it well worth it.",1389052800,,548,4.323529411764706

5688482,5,B00C2A4SYA,"As a fan of Shakespeare, it was delightful to see this production.  Not only was Whedon true to the script, but his fine take on the tale - making Conrad a woman, Borrachio being a young man interested in Hero, and therefore angry at her betrothal - these made it fresh and new.  Dogberry was particularly well done, as there was no pretension in his vocabulary, just wild inaccuracy.  Well done.",1388880000,,396,4.549295774647887

5688486,3,B00C2A4SYA,"I love the Kenneth Brannach version of this movie so it would be difficult to dethrone it.  This version is good, but it lakes the overall lightheartedness of the other.  It's a contemporary setting but period dialog, so it sets up a dissonance that takes some work on the viewers part to get past.  The returning warriors are in suits and packing side arms rather than swords.  I had some struggle keeping track of who was Beatrice and who was Hero, but maybe that was just me.  The Count's home and grounds are sumptuous yet modern, and much of the movie takes place, as does modern life, in the kitchen and dining area.  The dialog remains Shakespeare's so it is pure in that sense.  If you had no problem with the period tinkering of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" (the version with Pfeiffer and Kline) you will likely have no problem with this version of ""Much Ado"".  Fillion is the neighbor who is hired by the Count to provide comedic security, so you don't see him for the first half of the movie.  He plays a good bungler without going over the top, though Shakespeare clearly creates this character as a tedious dolt intended to be a nearly unbelievable half-wit.

I'll give it a second viewing after some time has passed and see if my rating changes.",1388793600,,1258,4.5265486725663715

I wasn't sure this could match the Emma Thompson one, but while that version was fun and beautiful this one is just as much fun and more personal.  Just to make sure you know - this is in black and white and it's awesome.  If you like this play, like Josh Whendon's creative approach to story telling or just like Nathan Fillion this will be fun.  In the extra features, check out the cast and director comment options after you view the movie.",1388620800,,588,4.214285714285714
5688490,2,B00C2A4SYA,Totally didn't see this coming. The director has people reading and I mean reading Shakespears play while dressed in contemporary costumes and settings. Cant imagine anyone forcing themselves to sit through it more than once. If the point was to prove the Bards work is timeless what got proven is that Old English isn't.,1388620800,,321,4.962962962962963
5688491,3,B00C2A4SYA,"The premise is interesting: a version of Shakespere's play using much of the original script but set in director Josh Wheedon's large, rambling California home.  the actors are dressed in suits, ties, and dresses but have contemporary mannerisms.  You would think that this would all work wonderfully, but it is only okay. Is it that the film is shot in black and white?  Is it that listening to the complicated, witty language of Shakespeare sounds odd from suntanned Californians?  Is that the we spent more time Looking at Wheedon's daughters' bedroom and Barbie dolls rather than the actors in the scene?  Also, like many Shakespeare plays, the relationship between all the characters can be confusing.  This is worth watching just to see the house or if you are studying this play.  It is kind of entertaining, but not as much as we had hoped.",1388620800,,848,4.847222222222222

5688501,5,B00C2A4SYA,"Admittedly, I'm not familiar with this play in the Shakespeare form. Whedon takes it into a more modern era, and shoots in black and white, so it has the feel of an old black-and-white film.

It is so well-shot and well-played by the actors, that it is easy to tell what is going on, even if you don't follow the Shakespearean language 100%. You can tell when the sinister bad guy is manipulating someone, when the two leads are tossing witty barbs, when the young lovers are serenading each other with poetry, and when the buffoon cop is being a buffoon. It comes together amazingly well.",1388102400,4,589,4.556603773584905

Amy Acker's Beatrice may be my favorite and that is coming from a lifelong Emma Thompson fan! The rest of the cast is great as well with standout performances by Nathan Fillion and Clark Gregg!

5688506,2,B00C2A4SYA,"I have to admit, I just don't think Im a fan of this story much.  I rather hated the 1993 version starring Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh, but at least with that version it felt authentic and fluid.  There is a lot missing from Joss Whedons adaptation, and all of the things that I thought would make me connect to this film wound up taking me even further out of the story and forcing me to hate it even more.

It is very pretty though.

Modernizing Shakespeare is nothing new.  We saw it done in 1996 with Romeo + Juliet and then again in 2000 with Hamlet.  Both of those versions, much like Whedons film, kept the original dialog and Old English dialect intact.  Im not ashamed to say that I consider Baz Luhrmanns Romeo + Juliet to be a masterpiece of modern cinema and a bench march for Shakespearian adaptations.  Its just perfect.  While many took issue with the use of Old English, I found that the natural performances really heightened the experience, taking the dialog and making it feel fresh, authentic and appropriate.  It is tricky when you take these particular words and update the setting.

Its a slippery slope.

Others have attempted updating Shakespeare and completely rewriting his dialog and situations to make it work.  We saw this in 1999s 10 Things I Hate About You.  It worked really, really well.  Shakespeare is a gamble, but it is a risk that many filmmakers and actors have attempted and will continue to attempt because his work is so important and universally beloved.

So, what exactly is the problem with Whedons Much Ado About Nothing?  Well, for starters, the acting is a serious sore point.  I will admit, I never followed Whedons television career and I am not familiar with these actors at all.  I do understand that he has a following and that these actors are regulars (mostly) for his work and that his fans were delighted to see them get roles here.  This was a passion project for Whedon as well, which I admire.  He filmed the whole thing at his own home.  I think that is also a major issue with me, for the nature of this film felt very drama student rehearsing.  The whole feel of the film was very amateur to me.  The line readings were awkward and while the majority of the staging and even the modern adapting of scenarios was intriguing and definitely eye catching, the delivery felt off kilter.

Alexis Denisof is especially unfortunate, and he has a major role here.

Despite being beautifully filmed, I found that my attention was never held by this film.  Like I mentioned on the outset, Im just not a fan of the story much, but I had higher hopes for this.  The convoluted plot can be scattered, cluttered and ridiculous, but where I initially thought the silly nature of the 1993 version was a detractor, Im beginning to think it was a saving grace.  This film loses all of the whimsy nature of the story and replaces it with slow burn that feels void of any real spark or energy.  It almost emphasizes the storys ridiculousness because it isn't masked over by the films tone.

Sadly, the film has no tone.",1387843200,,3068,4.553930530164534

5688510,3,B00C2A4SYA,"When I read reviews on this film, it seemed safe to order it, although I had never seen it. How can it miss when Joss Whedon made it? It misses in that the visual is neither striking nor pleasant. The characters seem to be always drinking. It reminds me, alas, of a party that started on Friday, and then the guests keep having to stave off hangovers by continuing to drink right through the weekend, never tidying after themselves. The hairstyles and clothing of the ladies are often limp, suggesting that they slept in their hair and did not bother to comb it. For two days. Saddest of all, a lesser male role of henchman is played by a woman dressed as a hooker, and when she is called ""Sirrah,"" one must simply cringe.
Face it. Much Ado is a difficult play to dazzle with. It needs zing and pepper between the two antagonistic lovers. The electricity between Beatrice and Benedick in this performance is about 63% on the Zing-o-Meter.

Though there are some really wonderful moments, they are only fleeting. And aside from the exceptional performances of Amy Acker, Fran Kranz, Nathan Fillion, Reed Diamond and Tom Lenk, the cast clearly demonstrates American's general lack in mastering the language and skill to perform Shakespeare. Alexis Densiof was either a bit too angry for comfort or simply reading out the lines, slurring and lacking a general grasp of how to communicate what he was given to deliver. His general lack of energy and enthusiasm made it uncomfortable to watch and in fact, boring. Mr. Clark would join him in this ranking, making us feel as though we were watching a mediocre high school production. I do apologize for being harsh with this critic, but the overall production was disappointing for all the hype it had received. Many of the lines and humor were missed. And for some reason beyond what we could figure out, the entire film is in black and white, creating an even duller atmosphere. That said.

His wordplay is masterful, but somewhat archaic and challenging for modern audiences to grasp, leading most audiences to lose interest in the work of the bard. Joss Whedon manages to achieve two goals that have plagued numerous other presentations of the Bard's work. He makes the Bard's mastery of language accessible and he manages to create an engaging movie that will keep audiences interested throughout. Unlike many productions, which approach Shakespeare with a reverence one might reserve for holy texts, Whedon's production is much more down to earth. Filmed in his home with some of his favorite friends and actors, Shakespeare work becomes an excuse for a good time, and you can easily tell how much fun everyone is having with each other as much as they having fun doing Shakespeare. This enthusiasm is contagious to the audience and makes the world of Shakespeare suddenly easy to relate to in a way that many productions fail dramatically to do.

5688552,3,B00C2A4SYA,"I was rather disappointed in this version of Much Ado.  The Brannagh version is one of my all-time favorite pieces of cinema and the play is my favorite of all of Shakespeare's works.  I've been quoting this play since I was in middle school.  I also adore Joss Whedon.  Firefly, Dollhouse, Buffy, Dr. Horrible - all works of writing and film genius.  So I had very high expectations going in.

Unfortunately, those expectations were not only not met, but they were exceedingly disappointed.  The first, and biggest, problem with this film, for me, was the leads.  Denisof and Acker have absolutely NO chemistry.  It sometimes feels like they're reciting lines to each other to practice for an upcoming performance, not actually performing.  The next problem is the pacing.  It's so frenetic that you don't get to appreciate any of the Bard's witticisms before you're haring off to the next one.  Last, the movie seems to pride itself on being sophisticated.  Yes, we get it, you're all very talented people who are doing Shakespeare! For fun! In secret!  You are the coolest of the cool.  Yawn.

There are some bright spots.  Fran Kranz's turn as Claudio was both charming and infuriating.  Nathan Fillion's Dogberry was amusing with a hilarious Tom Lenk following on as Verges.  In fact, most of the supporting cast, with a few notable exceptions in Reed Diamond as Don Pedro and Emma Bates as a bland Margaret, were excellent in their roles.  Sean Maher made a deliciously vile Don John.

Still, overall this was quite a disappointment to me.  It felt flat and claustrophobic.  I had hoped for much better.",1384992000,3,1609,4.834558823529412
5688553,5,B00C2A4SYA,"If you're familiar with the works of Shakespeare (which it should be noted I am not, with an exception or two), you'll find the plot of Much Ado About Nothing familiar: Beatrice (Amy Acker) and Benedick (Alexis Denisof) are engaged in a war of words, their witty barbs concealing their true love. While Benedick claims he will die a bachelor, the young Claudio (Fran Kranz) is determined to marry Hero (Jillian Morgese). While waiting for the wedding to occur, Benedick and Beatrice's friends/family decide to play a trick on them by declaring within earshot of one that the other is in love with them. Hilarity and drama ensue.

If you're familiar with the works of Joss Whedon (which it should be noted I am), you won't be at all surprised by how well he is able to combine thoroughly modern dress with Shakespeare's text. Whedon, ever an admirer of words, has changed but one word of the original dialogue (he got rid of an anti-Semitic joke), which is why you'll find snazzily dressed businessmen talking of war and citizens of the 21st century behaving as if a woman has no value other than her purity. Unlike Ralph Fiennes' recent adaptation of Coriolanus, which felt stiff and dull, Whedon's adaptation of Much Ado is full of life and energy. Though this is the first major non-SF/fantasy work he's done, it feels very much of a piece with the sort of genre mish-mashing Whedon does so well.

In some ways, this is the Joss Whedon movie I've always wanted. Just as some are worshipers of the Bard, I am a devout Whedonite. If you're screaming bloody bias right now, hey, I can't fault you. I've genuinely loved everything he's done--even Dollhouse, the weakest and least-regarded of his work, is fascinating--but Much Ado About Nothing is different. It's not that there are no monsters or spaceships, as I've seen some stodgy critics applaud the film for, but because Whedon has been freed from all creative restraints, as he was with 2008's Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. The off-the-cuff nature of the production, which went from conception to filming during a month's worth of downtime from The Avengers, lends the film a liberated, anything-goes spirit. The only set is Whedon's home, and the cast consists of good friends coming together for a laugh, but it is so much more than an in-joke.

For one, it just looks great. Shot in black-and-white by Dollhouse DP Jay Hunter, there isn't a single shot of this film that doesn't look gorgeous. Whedon financed the film himself, and while I'm sure he has deeper pockets than many other independent filmmakers, it's still impressive just how rich the photography is. The B&W screwball nature of the film recalls classics from the '30s and '40s; it's not hard to imagine Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant assuming the roles of Beatrice and Benedick in Whedon's version. While I've adored all his films, and Serenity in particular has some beautiful stuff, each of them has lacked some of the pure aesthetic verve of his TV work. That's not the usual complaint you hear; movies aren't supposed to look like TV! But the episodes of his series directed by the man himself, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer's ""The Body"" or Firefly's ""Objects in Space,"" are some of the most riveting pieces of filmmaking I've seen. Unrestrained by an anxious studio or Marvel's house style, Much Ado About Nothing captures the clever visual artistry of Whedon's best work.

So Whedon is a witty guy who knows his way around words, and he's got directorial chops. That's great. None of it would mean anything, though, if he hadn't assembled a cast capable of doing justice to Shakespeare's play. Luckily, almost all of the actors have worked with Whedon before and...well, what can I say? Whedon actors are just better than other actors. Acker and Denisof are terrific as Beatrice and Benedick. Denisof's macho blustering as Benedick hides a childish need to be loved; there's a great sight gag of him lying on his bed, legs swaying back and forth in the air as he gazes lovestruck at Beatrice's picture. Acker outdoes herself, giving one of the most confident and fully-realized performances of the year as Beatrice. Like Benedick, she talks a good talk, but only to hide from herself the fact that she loves Benedick more than anyone. Like nearly all the actors, they handle Shakespeare's dialogue with gusto, their modern line readings giving a new perspective on the Bard's work.

The rest of the cast is terrific as well. I liked Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson in the Marvel movies, but I never knew he could be as smart and cunning as he is as Leonato; Nathan Fillion works some of his Captain Hammer macho cluelessness on the role of Dogberry; Reed Diamond proves that he's one of the most undervalued actors in the Whedon stable as Don Pedro; Fran Kranz completely owns the role of Claudio, showing that there's more to him than the lovable nerd types of Dollhouse and The Cabin in the Woods; and newcomer Jillian Morgese makes a memorable debut as Hero, showing a talent for both the comedic and the dramatic, both of which are very important tools for Shakespeare and Whedon. A couple of the minor actors, like Garfunkel and Oates' Riki Lindhome and Spencer Treat Clark, don't handle the language as well, but they certainly don't derail the film.

After all that, what else is there to say? If you're a Whedon fan such as myself, you'll recognize everything you love about the man's work in a new setting and get goosebumps over Fred and Wesley being reunited; if you're a Shakespeare fan, you'll be pleased by such an inventive modern adaptation.

5688561,2,B00C2A4SYA,"I am a big fan of Shakespeare's original text of this play, and also a fan of Joss Whedon's other productions, so I sat down to this rendition of _Much Ado_ with great excitement. I was bitterly disappointed. Nathan Fillion delivered a sparkling performance as Dogberry; Sean Maher was a convincingly malevolent Don John; and the black-and-white spectrum was an interesting touch. Other than that, I was not impressed. The chemistry between major characters was negligible; the original story's gorgeous emotional nuances, all but lost. Many of the cast members seemed to be delivering lines with the mentality of ""Let these wonderful lines speak for themselves,"" rather than ""Let my well-rounded character speak these lines as a natural manifestation of his/her thoughts and motivations.""

I was not surprised to learn that Whedon had filmed this adaptation in twelve days. It's a cute project, given that timeline, but a bet that ultimately didn't pay off for me. If you want a version of _Much Ado_ that has laughs, gasps, tears, and all-around fantastic acting, I recommend heading straight for the recording of David Tennant and Catherine Tate's 2009 stage version.",1384646400,6,1170,5.190476190476191

But at the end of the day Joss Whedon's ironic humor, Amy Acker's portrayal of the witty and whimsical Beatrice, and the war of the sexes between Beatrice and Benedict won me over.

5688578,4,B00C2A4SYA,"Adapting Shakespeare for inclusion in a modern day setting isn't new.  Even when the original arcane dialog is used.  Director Joss Whedon taking a 12 day break from the still to be concluded ""The Avengers,"" gathers some of his old gang and sets up shop in his house to deliver this popular romantic comedy.

For those new to this language, it will definitely seem odd and take a while to get used to.  Especially when adapted to current times.  Shot in beautiful black and white, the story centers around a couple love stories.  One of the oddities in the play is that people fall in love quickly and want to get married even quicker.  Single parent Leonato (Clark Gregg) has only a virginal daughter, Hero (Jillian Morgese) but also acts as a father figure for his niece Beatrice (Amy Acker) who has certainly seen her share of amorous activity.  Both attractive ladies would seem to be prime marriage material for family and friends of nobleman Don Pedro (Reed Diamond).

Kinsman Claudio (Fran Kranz) quickly falls for Hero.  Benedick (Alexis Denisof) and Beatrice bicker at each other constantly, but underneath there is an obvious attraction.  The houseguests and the occupants play some trickery to get the couples together.  It works.  Hero and Claudio are set to be married the next day.

Throwing a monkey wrench into the plans, is Don Pedro's disgraced brother, Don John who is in tow with a couple of his friends.  Don John decides to play an evil trick on everyone by having one of his buddies have sex with one of the maids who would be disguised as Hero.  He would then lure Claudio and Don Pedro outside to view the couple copulating by an exposed window.

An inept constable, Dogberry (Nathan Fillion) and a pair of bumbling deputies come to the rescue having overheard the plot after it took place.  The film's pacing is quick enough to make you forget the disconnect between the centuries of origin and present day.  The acting itself is first rate and after a while you just settle in with the cadence of the language.  Frivolous and fun.",1384128000,,2057,4.692737430167598
5688579,5,B00C2A4SYA,"As a fan of Shakespeare, I really enjoyed this movie.  In my opinion, this is one of the best adaptations of any Shakespeare play.  The actors fully embrace the language, and maintain a pacing that resembles a good TV sitcom, which is unusual for Shakespeare.  The pacing and the clear language, coupled with the stylistic elements of setting it all in one house and filming in black and white truly set this film apart.  The performances are all excellent and the story is funny. Great film.",1384128000,,492,4.686046511627907
5688580,5,B00C2A4SYA,"Approachable and inviting, this adaptation of Shakespeare's comedy does the unthinkable--it manages to keep the language without seeming stilted in a more modern setting. Part of what makes Shakespeare difficult is that to perform it you must have a keen understanding of it, and many actors struggle to really inhabit the meaning rather than simply recite the lines. To inhabit while mastering a complicated comedic timing and beat-for-beat sparring match with the other actors? I have nothing but respect for anyone able to play Beatrice and Benedick well.

On that note, Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof have phenomenal chemistry. The black and white lends the film a noir-ish feel that matches the cagey humor, and Nathan Fillion and Tom Lenk are crazy-cool as the cops that get it right by accident. The girl who plays Hero has a beautiful dignity that made me want to cry during the (first) wedding scene. Amy Acker's performance of the ""If I were a man"" speech is heart-rending, and for a play supposedly about nothing, the combined weight of a woman's honor and a man's pride have a very real presence throughout. Visually interesting, full of unforced humor, and grounded in a deeply felt love story, Much Ado about Nothing is worth every bit of its 'ado'.",1384041600,,1261,4.92018779342723
5688581,3,B00C2A4SYA,"Joss Whedons adaptation, as any modern adaptation of Shakespeares plays, reduces its inner dimension. It does not matter how well it is done and how well performed, Shakespeares magic is gone. It does not mean that the movie is not interesting, enjoyable, or entertaining.
Shakespeares plays were structured in such a way, that they apply to our current situations, and they do not need to be adapted. In their original set-ups their magic is more adequate to our present situations than it was at the time of their original releases. Our thinking patterns have changed and our understanding has been enlarged. Now our minds are capable of digesting evolutionary concepts that were too abstract to be comprehended some 400 years ago. These various concepts are encompassed within the plays inner content. But the plays lose their inner dimension when the original set-ups are not respected. The same applies to filling-in seemingly gaps in the plays plots. The gaps are intentionally introduced to force our mind to look for answers. But to find the answers, one has to break away from ordinary, i.e., linear thinking pattern. This is why, for example, having Beatrice and Benedick in bed prior to the opening scene of Much Ado About Nothing trivializes their relationship and the entire play. Shakespeare left several clues that allow the audience to figure out the true nature of Beatrices and Benedicks previous encounter. The same applies to cutting off Dogdberrys crucial line in his briefing of the watchmen. Without that line it is impossible to recognize his true role in the play.",1384041600,,1589,5.068702290076335

I'm delighted he decided to take the step of actually filming one of them.  This is probably the best version of Much Ado (sorry, Mr. Branaugh) I've ever seen.  Sean Maher steps out of the heroic spotlight to play a villain, and does it so magnificently you wonder why he didn't turn villain long ago.  Amy Acker's Beatrice is the best I've seen in this play (honestly!).  Everyone does a terrific job, but one must mention Nathan Fillion's Dogberry.  My husband and I howled, both in the theatre with the rest of the crowd, and at home watching the Blu-ray.

5688593,5,B00C2A4SYA,"It's Shakespeare. It's Joss Whedon. Need I say more? Well, maybe I'll say a bit more...

The Look: First, it looks fabulous despite the low budget. Set pieces like the fete and the funeral procession through the woods were surprisingly impressive. And the choice to film in black and white coupled with Shakespeare's witty dialogue reminded me of an old 50s comedy. I half expected to see Audrey Hepburn or Cary Grant drop in for a cameo. The atmosphere it creates is smart, charming and classy.

Directing: The choice to set the play in modern times could have been a disaster, but Whedon pulls it off surprisingly gracefully. Sure, a few touches are distractingly corny---an ipod sets the mood music for one scene, Don John's apprehension is sent to Dogberry via his iPhone, etc. But overall, it wasn't overbearing. The story remains the central focus, to the point that I really ceased to pay attention to what the actors were wearing.

The confines of Whedon's house and yard also provide a more fitting, intimate setting for the play than Kenneth Branagh's lavish splashiness. Whedon uses this to great comic effect in the eavesdropping scenes, where Benedick and Beatrice tumble and bumble around trying to go unnoticed.

If I could make one complaint about the directing, it would be to disagree with Whedon's choice to give B&B a passionate romantic past. Several completely unnecessary flashbacks show them kissing and making love. This just carries the ""contemporary"" spin too far, reading more into the text than the text itself really provides. Plus there's the annoyance that ALL the fades are white flashes. A little variety would have looked a bit less low-budget. Other than that, he did a great job, and I say that as someone who doesn't usually go for modern reboots of the Bard.

(Extra item of note: Whedon composed the music score, which adds a refreshingly jazzy twist to the film's atmosphere but also has a more classic, tender feel in some places.)

Casting: When Branagh and Thompson set the standard, you can't really compete, you can just do something different well. That's exactly what Denisof and Acker offer---not on the same level, but different and good in their own way (though I had trouble getting into Acker as Beatrice at first, since I know her only as Root the psychopath from Person of Interest!) They have good chemistry, and their dramatic scenes together worked especially well.

Among the supporting cast, Hero and Claudio differed little from the Branagh interpretations. Don Pedro seemed perpetually drunk and not quite as likable as Denzel Washington's performance. But as others have noted, both Don John and Dogberry are considerable improvements over their Branagh counterparts. It's the difference between under-playing and over-playing (which reflects the entire production's less over-the-top approach). Clark Gregg as Leonato also had a great natural delivery, which makes sense given his extensive work with the Atlantic Theater Company. I would agree with other reviewers that he handled the dialogue the best of all the cast members.

The Bottom Line: If you hadn't told me this was filmed in 12 days, I wouldn't have guessed. That's how well everyone pulled this off. Buy it and enjoy it as a prime example of what happens when a bunch of pros get together and decide to do something fun just for the hell of it.",1383609600,,3372,4.976909413854352

I'm sure Joss had fine intentions and felt really good about making the movie, I mean proving not only how much smarter and better educated he and his pals are than the TV audiences that made him so much money, but also that no mere Hollywood TV hack, he is as serious an artist as, say, any of those snooty Euro auteurs shooting Dogma-style with available light and making the actors do their own make-up. Plus you just can't argue with Shakespeare when it comes to establishing ""real theatre"" credibility and prestige.

No doubt Joss & friends all had a perfectly splendid time, the caterers on set served only all organic meals, they had good wine at lunch just like the French and Italians always do on location, etc., etc., but one suspects that you really had to be there to fully appreciate that private party.

5688611,5,B00C2A4SYA,"So many people have offered excellent reviews and observations on this movie that I feel a bit superfluous adding my thoughts, so I'll keep this short and sweet.

Much Ado is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays because it ends in earned love and nobody dies. Whedon captures the sheer joy of the play, but he also eclipses it with enough darkness that the happy ending is not assured. The look on poor, innocent Hero's face as she is falsely denounced by an inherently decent man who has been duped by a cruel trick is enough to break the heart of a cynic. In ""Othello,"" a similar deception ends in murder and tragedy.

Whedon has chosen to use Shakespeare's own words, without paraphrasing, throughout the film, a pretty bold decision when you also decide to set it in contemporary times. Because the actors are so good, even if you have never read the play, you will follow the story without difficulty. The choice to open the movie with Benedick and Beatrice having once consummated their attraction alters the entire dynamic and thrust of the story. It was an inspired decision, but a risky one.

Black and white suits this film. Partly, it is the astonishing architecture of the house itself (designed and built by Whedon's wife...how lucky is this dude?), which is a meditation on light, glass, mirrors, and what we see and don't see.

Nathan Fillion's performance as Dogberry is the best I've seen. It is funny and pivotal to the happy conclusion, but not a parody. He invests the character with an ineffable quality of desire for nobility. It is an interpretation of the character that I have not seen before and made me happy for the education in how a gifted actor can bring a new perspective on any character, no matter how well known.

The characters spend almost all the movie with a drink in their hand, which was occasionally distracting, but that is such a small complaint when measured against Amy Ackers' brilliance (her fierce demand for Claudio's death, among many other excellent moments, including her gift for physical comedy), Gregg was not the first choice for Leonato, I understand, but his essential good humor and decency invests him with the requisite qualities to settle all matters at the end. Franz Kranz is amazing as Claudio. Even as he is destroying Hero, you still like him, Alexis Denisof was able to morph from a witty hedonist to someone who not only appreciates Beatrice, but deserves her.

I liked this movie. Wish I'd seen it in a theater. It is worth renting if you, like me, like romantic comedies that have a hint of potential tragedy in them.",1383177600,,2589,4.716814159292035

5688613,5,B00C2A4SYA,I'd seen the film twice in the theater and was very pleased with the quality of the DVD and extras. Loved the commentaries and behind the scenes footage. Well done Joss!,1383177600,,169,4.483870967741935
5688614,4,B00C2A4SYA,"Provided you can understand old English, you will enjoy this adaptation of the Shakespeare play. At first, I found the all black-and-white format strange. I thought my disc was defective. But it wasn't, and the black-and-white format adds a special character to the film. The movie was enjoyable and, at times, funny. I found the dialogue much easy to follow than the 1993 version of this movie, even though both versions used American actors. By my troth it is true, my lord! Maybe it was the modern setting that made the old English easier to follow.

Some characters were changed from the original play. But these were minor roles. There were some parts left out. But for the most part, the movie is true to the original.

However, two roles were miscast. Joss Whedon used far too many actors from his past endeavors -- Firefly, Dollhouse, the Avengers. All the actors did an excellent job, but two should not have been used in the roles they were. Fran Kranz (Topher Brink in Dollhouse) was not a good Claudio. That is not say he did a bad job, but his acting style is more suited to someone who is mischievous. Sean Maher (Simon Tan in Firefly) was a terrible Don John. Again, not because he did a bad job, but because Sean Maher is terrible as a villain. In Firefly and Serenity, he was excellent as someone who cares deeply about people to the point that he neglects himself. That is he style; a villain's style is the exact opposite. I think Joss Whedon desired to use actors he was familiar with too much.

Even so, the directing was excellent. Joss Whedon has a way of bringing out nuances that enrich the characters and the story. Unspoken actions, camera placements to enhance a person's emotions, and knowing when to use steady-cams and hand cameras are just such things Joss Whedon knows how to use well. Little things like that really enhanced this movie.

For anyone who likes a story with a plot, in fact for anyone who values a plot in a movie over all else, I highly recommend this movie. There are far too few movies today that replace a good plot with a big budget, lots of cursing, sex, and violence. I want a good story, this movie delivered.",1383091200,,2165,4.543589743589743

Also, I thought filming it in black and white was sort of weird.  I think Joss W. would have done better to update the dialog into more modern English to go with his more modern costumes and set - and then filmed the piece in color.  The Bard's stories are timeless, but, and this is a huge but, it takes truly gifted actors to pull off the original dialog.  Timing is everything with Shakespeare, and as the Brits say, it must be ""spot on"".  This cast just didn't have it.  They memorized the wording beautifully, but the feeling and the timing just weren't there.  They gave a good attempt, but it fizzled instead of sizzled.",1382832000,2,790,4.430555555555555

His past works I have watched (Buffy, Angel, The Avengers, Dr. Horrible's, Serenity, Firefly) I enjoyed ever so much, and really looked forward to this movie, too.  I have seen modernized renditions of Shakespeare in movies and plays in the past, some wonderful, some just okay, but this, to me, is an embarrassment.  I felt like I was watching a group of actors recite lines and drink excessively throughout!  I am beyond disappointed!  There's no reason this movie should be this bad with such a cast of actors and such a director.  I really like Alexis Denisof and I love Amy Acker.  Denisof's acting in this movie is so bad - his delivery of lines, lack of inflection - it's like he wasn't even trying!  And Acker wasn't much better.  They play the main characters in this movie, and yet, there is absolutely NO chemistry between them!  How is that possible?  They played characters very much in love on the TV series Angel, and there was bookoos of chemistry between them on there!  I can't in all fairness blame the actors, though.  Generally bad acting is a result of bad directing, and it is rampant in this movie!  Honestly, I've never seen such a bad rendition of a Shakespeare play in my life!!  My daughter and I watched this together and were both deeply disappointed!  The next morning, we had to watch Kenneth Branagh's version of ""Much Ado About Nothing"" to wipe the memory of this travesty from our minds.  If you want to see a really great version of this play, then Branagh's version is it.  In fact, Branagh's version is as close to perfection as one can get!

5688629,5,B00C2A4SYA,"This production, with virtually no seasoned Shakespeareans among the cast and crew, is the opposite of the Kenneth Branagh 1993 film in virtually every way possible, beginning with the fact that several of the Branagh cast were expert at playing Shakespeare. Branagh's version is in color, this is in black and white. Branagh is done as a period piece, this is done as if it were yesterday. Joss Whedon 's cast is composed of mostly actors who had major roles in his earlier projects. The two leads were costars in Whedon's ""Angel"" series. Nathan Fillion was the star of Whedon's ""Firefly"" and ""Serendipity"" projects. What this generally means is that the leads in this production were weaker than in Branagh's production, which paired Branagh as Benedick with Emma Thompson as Beatrice, an incomparable  match which Alexis Denisof and Amy Acker cannot equal. Reed Diamond, however, is a fair match to Denzel Washington as Don Pedro, especially since he fits so well into the latter day ""Mad Men"" atmosphere of Whedon's film. Sean Maher outshines Keanu Reeves, because Reeves simply blows his part.

The performance I was really anticipating was Nathan Fillion as Dogberry. I was not really unhappy with Michael  Keaton's performance, but his slapstick interpretation simply did not fit into Whedon's time and place. As is true of much of this treatment, Fillion goes in exactly the opposite direction, and underplays the comic part, with almost deadpan delivery.

Judging by a performance photographed on the stage of the Globe Theater in London, Whedon stays much closer to Shakespeare's lines, although I did detect some speeches left out, such as the song sung early in Act 1 by the messenger.

Shakespeare's language and plots are always so rich that you hardly feel you are missing something if you watch two or three versions of his plays. There are so many ways in which they can be interpreted, there is an extra thrill, once you have a good ear for the dialogue, in seeing how certain things are done differently.

If you like Shakespeare at all, there is much value to owning both versions.",1382400000,3,2101,4.937677053824363

5688633,4,B00C2A4SYA,"In the modern world Shakespeare only works if we fit the best of him to what is there,we need to cut away the great seas of rhetoric and go with the flow. Get an ensemble of working actors who are at ease with each other, working in unison on productions of different material made for TV and film(as here)and just film them over 10 days in one setting. What does Shakespeare need to be realized now and be seen by a mass audience of youth who would not otherwise see him? Why,update him and show how relevant he is. So examples we've seen like Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet,McKellen's Richard III,Fiennes's Coriolanus,Branagh's Henry V have shown us what can be done. Are we aiming for `realism'? No. We can get to imaginative truth,say by shooting in black and white. Whedon has got an enviable experience of moulding a company of actors in his Firefly or Buffy TV productions. He's rehearsed with them many times. He filmed MAAN in his home estate,with the great help of his wife's production. Shakespeare `was not for an age,but for all time',but maybe he never wrote as if for eternity,he wrote living dramas to be performed for 1 or 2 years only before he moved onto the next one. If it doesn't live in the present it doesn't live at all.

We never fully understand Shakespeare,but we get closer to him by performing his rich tapestries of language, freighted with human emotion. The language is only archaic if its not spoken;familiarity is what we need. Whedon started filming this a week after finishing The Avengers Assemble. Directed on a low budget with a cast of friends and colleagues whom he'd got round to his house for regular readings of Shakespeare. They rehearsed this first. This romance involves a cruel con-trick and a startling murder sub-plot. MAAN anticipates the shift of tone and genre of modern cinema. This modern LA version is set in a gated community of the sparring between Beatrice and Benedict,who hate each other until he's tricked into believing she loves him,she overhears Hero and her maid discussing his love for her. The play is a template for the modern rom-com:hate,followed by shenaningans,then falling in love.

Whedon has kept the original verse. Everything is perfectly comprehensible and still funny. We could be watching a US-sitcom. It's refreshing,you can understand all the jokes here. There is a sudden change of mood,when Beatrice asks Benedict to kill Claudio,after her outrage at his treatment of Hero,to prove Benedict's love for her. Magically, Whedon's approach is effortless. He's not in awe of the text,he's known for his wit and wordplay(cf. Buffy).The film is not perfect: we're not really sure what they're doing there;you're never sure of the soldiery/war context(are they corporate bosses/mafia hitmen?).Don John is the villain and fits in with a tale of deception/double-cross in a comedy-noir in this b/w film. He is exposed by the fumbling and incompetent constable, Dogberry(Fillion,great).We don't get a sense of the whole plot as in Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet,but this doesn't need to suck up to youth as that did. This is for the 30+ audience. Whedon is good with female characters and crafts a fluent,contemporary story in the large Spanish-style house good for visual twists and physical play with many corners and stairs. Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof are incredible as the barbed pair. Music by Whedon",1382227200,,3368,4.980461811722913
5688634,5,B00C2A4SYA,"First off, I'm not a Shakespeare fan, but I am a Joss Whedan fan so I had to try this out. The dialogue is Shakespeare's, but the setting is modern. The actors are mostly people from Whedon's TV shows.

This movie has everything - humor, villainy, buffonery, romance, drinking

I saw it originally in the the theater. For some reason, I struggled with the dialogue in the theater. Everyone said you get used to it after about 5 mins, but there was a fair amount that I just couldn't quite get. Don't get me wrong, I fully understood what was happening in the story but some of the lines escaped me. In the theater I guess the language stressed me out a little at the beginning, but when the cocktail party started, I settled back and relaxed and thoroughly enjoyed the show.

I just recently watched it on my TV and had no trouble with the dialogue. I don't know if there was a sound issue in the theater or if seeing it once before prepared my brain to accept the language, but I was able to understand everything on the second viewing.

I know it was filmed in just 12 days. You would think that it would look like it had been thrown together, but it doesn't! Joss did a wonderful job and I don't think anyone would ever suspect that it had such a small budget and short shooting time.

The actors did a wonderful job with this movie. I especially think Amy Acker deserves an Oscar. Clark Gregg, Reed Diamond and Nathan Fillion were all excellent as well.

Spoiler Alert: The one thing that bothered me was at the wedding when (in modern times) Claudio was beyond upset that his fiance was not a virgin and her father would rather she die than to bring such disgrace on him. This part really didn't work for me in a modern setting although the fact that Claudio saw her apparently betray him on the night before the wedding added some credibility to it. That was the only part that I struggled with. On my second viewing I really didn't give it another thought.

Frankly I'm hoping this little movie gets several Oscar noms.",1382227200,4,2026,4.401069518716578
5688635,3,B00C2A4SYA,"First of all, I love Joss Whedon's work.  I love Shakespeare as well, so this should have been a match made in heaven.  Alas, it was not.  While it was novel to see many Whedonverse actors in this production, many of them came across as though they were simply reciting lines and had little to no idea what they were saying.  Clark Gregg as Leonato was impressive, but too many of the others were flat and monotone.  I was excited to see Amy Acker cast as Beatrice only to be disappointed by a listless performance.  She came to life briefly during her ""were I a man"" speech, but was otherwise dull and lifeless.  I was surprised at the lack of chemistry between Acker and Denisof (seriously, how could Wesley and Fred have NO chemistry?), but there was nary a spark between the two.  Sean Maher (who I normally adore) does not seem to realize that playing a villain requires more than grimacing while reciting his lines.  Fillion, though amusing for the most part, seemed stiff and uncomfortable.  Too many members of the cast reminded me of my students reading their lines in class when we study Shakespeare.

 I had no problem with the modern setting.  I recently viewed a production of Much Ado staged in a modern setting, using original Shakespearean text starring David Tennant and Catherine Tate as Benedick and Beatrice that was wildly entertaining.  This play could be performed on an empty stage with minimal props and be wonderful if the actors are comfortable with their roles and the dialog.  Unfortunately, that was not the case here.  The Whedon's have a lovely home, but it did not make up for the obvious discomfort of the cast with the text.

I applaud Whedon for his love of Shakespeare and the fact that he gathers friends and family together to read and workshop various works of the Bard.  I would love to attend Nerd Camp at the Whedon's home, but this was not really a production that was ready for public consumption.",1382140800,3,1942,4.628654970760234

Acker is terrific.  She makes this movie, forget everything you know about Fred and Dr. Saunders.  She isn't them, she plays a full character that will make you laugh and cry.

Denisof is creditable, unfortunately, this is where you can't help but draw Branagh comparisons.  When Branagh challenges you to a dual it's serious, he's not screwing around and he will seriously mess you up.  Somehow I didn't feel that way about Alexis.  Maybe it's a hangup from early Buffy, maybe it's because British guys are somehow scarier, but he just couldn't quite pull it off.

5688643,5,B00C2A4SYA,"This is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, and this is now my favorite version of it. The challenge of moving the action into the 21st century might seem to be daunting--after all the major plot point is accusing a woman for being unchaste on the night before her wedding. A 21st century Western audience might view the male characters all piling on to publicly humiliate the woman as totally out of proportion to the offense even if it were true.  But the deceived groom and the falsely accused bride are presented as both shy and unsophisticated people, put into an intolerably painful public display. It worked.

What also worked that I have never seen done so well in ANY production of Much Ado was Nathan Fillion, as Dogberry and his equally brilliant Keystone Cop-style Watch. Shakespeare's clowns can be painful rather than funny to a modern audience. I usually suffer in silence as Dogberry does his clumsy constabulary duty. But Nathan Fillion's brilliant evocation of a Dogberry straight out of a noir cop movie made me laugh, laugh again and look forward to seeing it many times and laughing yet again.

For what its worth if you are not familiar with Shakespeare - then just relax, don't try and understand every word or phrase and let the story and dialogue wash over you - you will not be disappointed.",1381795200,4,698,4.496062992125984
5688645,4,B00C2A4SYA,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

There's no denying that Shakespeare's influence is slowly fading year after year. For most, his work is simply too difficult to comprehend when majority of readers read for pleasure. However, there are others, like Joss Whedon, who continuously try to keep the legendary poet relevant. I'll admit, before sitting down to watch Much Ado About Nothing, I was unfamiliar with the play. You see, I too find Shakespeare's writing a chore to get through, but I still find myself constantly drawn to his work. His stories always manage to be both grand and unbelievably simple at the same time, which is probably why I have this irrefutable attraction to his plays.

As one would guess, Much Ado About Nothing is very similar in that regard. Taking place in Messina, Sicily, the story follows a group of individuals who are surrounded by love, lies, and deception. Claudio (Fran Kranz) and Hero (Jillian Morgese) may seem like the main couple in the beginning, but as the story progresses, a greater emphasis is put on Benedick (Alexis Denisof) and Beatrice (Amy Acker). Now, as with any Shakespeare story, there are a lot of characters and most, if not all, are important in their own, individual way. Also, there are multiple stories that intertwine to form a much larger narrative. Unfortunately, there seems to be a lot of absent information which leaves a lot of room for confusion.

Therein lies my biggest complaint: Much Ado About Nothing seems tailored to the familiar. Those uninitiated are left to fend for themselves in hopes of gaining the slightest understanding of the story being told. The plot is always advancing, but the viewer is left without any back-story or explanation as to why these things are happening. As if adjusting to the Shakespearean language wasn't difficult enough, I now had to put together the pieces of a puzzle with just a few lines here and there of what ""might"" have happened. Most of my understanding came from assumption and it wasn't until I researched after-the-fact that I actually grasped the story in its entirety.

With that said, though, it's hard for me to be too negative because it's just so damn enjoyable. Maybe it's the fact that it was filmed in black and white or maybe it's because of its overwhelming simplicity, but it's such a joy to watch. Even when I only had a minimal understanding of what was going on, I was having the time of my life. The characters, the world they inhabit, and the story that surrounds them is so grounded that you would think you were taking a peak over a neighbor's wall watching these events unfold.

It should be noted, though, that I wasn't a fan of Whedon's choice to modernize the setting. The language, mannerisms, and cultural traditions present in the story didn't always mesh well in this modern, suburban area. Another thing I noticed was that these modernizations weren't always consistent. For example, in what I can only assume was a police station, they had these ancient looking surveillance monitors, but they had nice, flat screen computer monitors. Then the interrogation ""room"" wasn't closed off by any walls or two-way mirrors. It was just open space for anyone and everyone to see and hear what was going on. An argument could be made that the setting is a few decades old, but there were two or three iPhone sightings so that couldn't be true. It was really odd.

Finally, as a whole I felt the casting was solid. There's a pretty lengthy cast -- and more than a few familiar faces -- so I won't break them down one by one. I will say, though, that they were all consistently good. However, at times, I found that the delivery of their lines sounded a bit sarcastic. Almost to the point where it sounded like they were mocking the source material. Also, there were a handful of instances where a scene felt very... fabricated. Most of these were found in the more emotional sections of the story, so it doesn't wind up bringing the film down too much, but it did break the engagement that was built up from previous scenes.

Overall Score: 8.2/10 - While it may have its faults, Much Ado About Nothing is truly a wonderful film. Not only does it tell an engaging story, but it does so in a way that really sticks with you. While I can't comment on how well it relates to the original play, I can say that is a blast to watch and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in Shakespeare.",1381795200,2,4456,4.690537084398977

It's hard to beat the excellent Kenneth Branagh version of 1993, but even without comparing with it this version is lacking. With the honorably exception of Amy Acker, who plays an excellent Beatrice, most of the other actors are between fair to inadequate. Particularly unconvincing are Nathan Fillion (Dogberry), Clark Gregg (Leonato), Reed Diamond (a very poor Don Pedro), Frank Klanz as Claudio and Jillian Morgese as Hero. The consequence of the mostly poor casting is that there are absolutely no chemistry between Hero and Claudio, and both the comic as well the dramatic scenes fall mostly flat and it is very hard to feel moved by them. To complete a very brief review of the main actors, Alexis Denisof is fair as Benedick and Spencer Treat Clark (he was the boy Lucius in Gladiator, 14 years younger) is not bad as Borachio.",1381795200,4,955,4.793939393939394

The black and white photography is accented by the use of angles on glass - windows, wine bottles, jars. The comedy is muted and you have to look for it. Nathan Fillian locking the keys in the car ... the big tough soldiers getting ready to bunk in the little girl bedroom of Joss' daughter.

5688651,5,B00C2A4SYA,"I feel like a five-star review implies perfection, and it wasn't perfect, but I did love the film. I absolutely adored it.

I'm not a Shakespeare fan and at first I was worried: worried because it was in black and white (I watched the trailer so I don't know how I didn't realize it was going to be B&W) and worried that I wouldn't be able to follow along with the language. And yes, the first five minutes were hard for me to grasp. But then I found myself listening to the actors' tone and watching their body language and everything made perfect sense.

And the black and white really goes perfectly with the tone; think ""It Happened One Night"" or ""Arsenic and Old Lace."" Screwball humor, basically, with just a dash of slapstick in all the right places.

The cast was fantastic. It's so good to see some of Whedon's favorites come together. Sean Maher is the perfect villain. And holy hell! I've never seen anything Reed Diamond has been in - I really need to get around to watching Dollhouse - but he just blew me away! I love the way he delivers that ""mountain of affection"" line.

Like I said, it wasn't perfect, exactly. There's this funeral scene that feels out of place, particularly when it's followed by this balcony conversation that makes it seem like the funeral hasn't happened. But it wouldn't have made any sense if the funeral scene had directly followed the balcony scene, either. I liked the funeral scene on its own...it just didn't seem to fit as a whole.

So, nearly perfect. Definitely enjoyable.",1381708800,4,1521,4.577205882352941

It takes talented actors to pull of many of the hilarious lines that Shakespeare wrote and this group did it marvelously! I also found the setting to add to the film. When a man is swooning over a photo and looking ridiculous, it really adds to the scene to have him in a little girl's bedroom where all the stuffed animals are wearing tiaras. It just makes it all the more funny! But I guess some people don't get that. As for the black and white: if you desperately need color to enjoy a movie, I feel bad for you.

5688662,5,B00C2A4SYA,"I'll say up front that there was very little chance that I wouldn't love this movie. Much Ado is one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, and I've loved everything Joss Whedon has ever written or directed, so it surprised no one that I loved this film. I was a little surprised at how MUCH I loved it though. Even with my high expectations, this movie managed to surpass them. According to the commentaries, several cast members had never done Shakespeare before. It doesn't show, at all. The performances are great. Nathan Fillion supposedly tried to back out, twice, because he was so nervous about his ability to play Shakespeare, but his Dogberry is one of the highlights of the movie. I was shocked when I looked Jillian Morgese (who plays Hero) up on IMDB and discovered her only other credit was as an extra in The Avengers. She certainly doesn't seem like she's new to acting or to film. Whedon's adaptation does a fantastic job of going beyond the text without changing it. Silent moments, sight gags, little bits of facial expression and physicality add new twists and dimensions, or clarify character motivations that are not inherent to the dialogue. For people who have trouble with understanding the language, this is an exceptionally accessible version. I know several people who were hesitant to watch it because of the language and they were able to follow the story and get the jokes without a problem. I've seen a lot of people complain about the black & white, the modern dress, etc. These things were largely budgetary concerns. Personally, I find the obviously low budget nature of the film adds to its charm. The fact that the entire thing was shot in 12 days at Joss Whedon's own house is nothing short of impressive. I also recommend the commentary tracks on the blu ray. One is Joss Whedon, alone, and it's very interesting and informative. In the other, Joss is joined by most of the cast, and that one is harder to follow, with so many people talking and laughing at once, but it's also very funny. It's unlikely, but I dearly hope that Whedon and company produce more cheap Shakespeare adaptations, because this is one of the best movies I've seen in years.",1381622400,9,2183,4.717277486910994

For anyone who has wondered, ""What's the big deal about Shakespeare?"", go and see this film, and you will understand.

This story was written four hundred years ago, and yet in this production it has been slipped gently into the present day, and without other modification than extreme cleverness in the setting of scenes, the play still works.

It works because the director and actors trust the words. The words give them the situation, the relationships between the characters, and each character's attitudes and objectives.

I've never seen a production of Shakespeare, on either coast, or in London or Stratford, where the actors weren't winking and nudging the words, saying some of them louder, or, gods help us, slower, to make sure the audience understood the this bit is funny, or this bit is important. There's none of that in this production. And because of this, the simplicity and exactitude of each moment in each scene is clear, and strong. The play renders its power through its weight on each characters' hearts, and their love, pain, joy and desires conveys the story truly and lovingly.

The pacing is exquisite. The extension of the first night's revelry into the drunken aftermath of the cold morning light, makes the Prince's offhand marriage proposal to Beatrice finally make sense. The brilliant choice that Borachio had a history with Hero makes his actions, and his later confession, work. It also puts the proper weight on the little scene that is usually cut, where Hero is deciding what to wear.

I've never seen a better production of Shakespeare. What a joy that this one will run forever.",1381536000,16,1663,4.942652329749104
5688667,5,B00C2A4SYA,"First thing to keep in mind:  This is not a ""mega production"".  It was not done to make money.  It was not done for fame.  It was done by fans of Shakespeare as something fun and challenging to do.  It may actually help to watch the ""making of"" short first to get you in the right mindset.  This is a bunch of friends getting together to do the play.  Joss did all the casting.  It's almost a ""pick-up"" version of Shakespeare.  Yes, some of the casting isn't the first choice _you_ would have made.  They weren't the ""best"" that could have been gotten out of all the actors and actresses available.  But these all were friends of Joss, many in roles they had never considered playing.  With that in mind.

It was better than almost any other presentation I've ever seen, movie or stage.  The Kenneth Branagh movie was better, but you're talking about two different types of movie here.  Nathan Fillion's Dogberry was a completely different take than all past.  His delivery of the lines were completely straight faced and so reasonable that it actually takes you a second before you realize what he uttered was completely nonsense.  Amy Acker's Beatrice was brought out nuances to the character that are often hidden by traditional deliverance methods that are meant for stage (big and loud).  Sean Maher as Don John is inspired.  If you can believe it, this was his first ""bad guy"" role.

They mainly stood around and looked pretty while talking funny. I was reminded of THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN, where most of the direction had to have been, ""Lean against the counter and say your lines.""

Whedon is a modern Genius known for his ability to turn a witty phrase and for writing strong, independent female characters (so think the opposite of Stephanie Meyer).
So what to do when the words are already written for you? You make it visually interesting. As Shakespeare words unfold from Whedonite experienced actors Like Nathan Fillion, Amy Acker, Clark Gregg etc Joss uses the visual element of movie making to amuse the audience and throw in little touches that make the experience unique.
While at all times the acting isn't Perfect Amy Acker's Pleading speech as Beatrice to Benedict, regarding avenging Hiro's honor was brilliant.
Shot in 12 days during post Production of Avengers at Joss Whedon's home as a pet project for him and shot all in black and White this makes a great change of pace addition to The Legion of Whedon obsessed fans collection.

5688684,4,B00C2A4SYA,"First of all, if you can't past the idea of using the original William Shakespeare text in modern times, nothing will probably make you like this film.  I personally think it was a bold choice.  The works of ""The Bard"" have endured for centuries for a reason.  There are MANY examples of films adapting Shakespeare, many of them great (Forbidden Planet, 10 Things I Hate About You, Gnomeo & Juliet, just off the top of my head).  Whedon seems to be saying, let's let the words speak for themselves.  He then chose to put the words into the mouths of what Joss Whedon fans will recognize as a ""Dream Cast.""  I've been saying for many years that Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof (as bickering lovers Beatrice and Benedick) should be bigger stars.  And while Whedon's film didn't exactly make them household names, it does put the pair front and center where they belong.  And who doesn't love ""Avengers"" and ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" actor Clark Gregg?  He makes acting look effortless, even in the strange tongue used here.  Add Nathan Fillion and ""Buffy""'s Tom Lenk for some great comedy and ""Firefly""'s Sean Maher in a rare villain role, and you've really got something.

In the (22 min.) documentary, Whedon offers his justification for the choices he made--shooting in black & white, casting and location.  I think my favorite part is when Nathan Fillion gushes about Gregg: ""I just watched him in that scene and I thought, 'So THAT's how it's done.'""  There are also commentary tracks with the director and cast, but I haven't watched them (as much as I love learning about how films are made, I usually get bored quickly with those).

Like I said above, if you can accept the ancient dialects, it's really a very good adaptation.  The themes of the film--the joys and absurdities of love--are universal.  I don't consider myself well-read on Shakespeare, but the story was easy to follow.  Certainly, if you're a fan of Whedon and his cast, this is a must-see.",1381190400,6,1960,4.734513274336283
5688685,1,B00C2A4SYA,"And I'm not just talking about the digitally processed ""black and white"" film. But, I will talk about that, because it was the first thing I noticed about the film and didn't like.

The choice to do the film in black and white was I am sure well-intentioned, but it didn't serve any purpose that I could see, and it actually made the film less interesting to watch. And before someone jumps in and accuses me of not understanding the nuances of black and white film making, let me just note that I like a lot of black and white classic films perfectly well. Colorized ""Casablanca,"" for example, is just a travesty. ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" is perfect in black and white, as are all the film noir classics. ""Some Like it Hot"" never fails to entertain, nor does ""All About Eve,"" and all of them are in black and white.

So, yeah, back to ""Much Ado About Nothing."" The problem with the black and white in this film is that there isn't enough contrast in the film--there are no really pure whites and no pure blacks so it all comes across as bland shades of grey, and unfortunately, it makes the already very similar looking actors look even more alike. So, yeah. Not good.

And then there is the ""acting."" I've seen plenty of the actors in other films, and there is nothing wrong with their acting ability, except in this film. Wooden doesn't even begin to describe them. The lines are just being said, with no emotion behind them. Amy Acker, who plays Beatrice comes across as just a whiny, naggy bitch, not a witty, independent woman, and her squeaky voice worked my last nerve.

How could this film NOT be awesome?

For those that don't know, Whedon is not only the king of all things geeky (BUFFY, ANGEL, FIREFLY, DOLLHOUSE, SERENITY, CABIN IN THE WOODS and a little film called THE AVENGERS), but he's a tremendous Shakespeare buff. Stories have circulated for years about how he would have cast members of his various shows come to his Santa Monica home, sit around, have dinner and drinks and recite some of Shakespeare's plays. Now, he has essentially brought that idea to film in a ""micro-budgeted"" self-produced digitally-shot black-and-white adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most famous comedies, MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING. Whedon, not one to shy away from working with his friends, made this film with many of his former cast members of his various shows and films, and it's shot entirely in and around that same Santa Monica home.

For those that don't know the play, it is a love story of two couples: there's the love-at-first-sight coupling of Claudio (Kranz, as excellent as he was in both DOLLHOUSE and CABIN IN THE WOODS) and Hero (Jillian Morgese, a talented and beautiful newcomer), and there's the epic battle-of-the-sexes coupling of Benedick (Denisof) and Beatrice (Acker). Much romance and comedy ensues, but the jealous plotting of Don John (Maher) threatens to undo everything. But soon to the rescue comes Dogberry (Fillion), the constable of these parts, who is, as should be noted, an ass.

Kenneth Branagh, who has spent most of his directorial career adapting Shakespeare for the screen (HENRY V, HAMLET), did a film adaptation of this back in the early 1990's with something of an all-star cast. There are several similarites but even more differences between Whedon's and Branagh's adaptations, and it's the differences that make or break the film. While the Branagh version had Hollywood heavyweights such as Emma Thompson, Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, Michael Keaton and Branagh himself, this is filled with people who may be popular to their fans but are hardly box-office draws, and there's where this film is, in part, more successful. Whedon casts each actor to their strength as opposed to going for bigger names, and the performances are more robust, more natural, and more absorbing. Whedon's version also forgoes the period trappings, and does everything against a modern backdrop. This is not an unusual method for adapting Shakespeare, but it works better in some ways than Branagh's more sweeping and elegant period piece. Also, this film does some slight gender-swapping for at least one character (turning a male character of Conrade, Don John's co-conspirator and lover, into a female one). This, to me, is a hinderance, mostly because of my personal interpretation of the character of Don John, but it ends with personal opinion.

Ultimately, both films are pretty great, but if I had to say which one I enjoyed watching more, it's this one. And while Branagh and Thompson, who played Benedick and Beatrice in their version, are acting gods, I could watch Denisof (perhaps the most underrated actors of the Whedonverse) and Acker (whose character actor status has grown exponentially since her days on ANGEL) play these roles every single day and twice on Sunday. They are an absolute joy to watch together, particularly after their work together on ANGEL, and especially how their characters played out on that program. I don't want to spoil too much for those who haven't yet tasted the amazing show that ANGEL was (my favorite of the Whedonverse programs), but let's just say things could have been better for Denisof and Acker on that show. In fact, every actor brings their A-game. Shining particularly brightly (other than Denisof and Acker) are Gregg as the wise and jovial Leonato, Diamond (another veteran of DOLLHOUSE) as the strong and clever Don Pedro, and Fillion as the blundering and exhuberant Dogberry.

This film has more moments of great comedy than most of the other comedies released recently, with maybe the exception of Wright and Pegg's THE WORLD'S END, but the only real minus against this film is Whedon's lack of visual flair. He's always been much more of an actor's director, and with his confident work on SERENITY and THE AVENGERS, it seems like he took more of a point-and-shoot style to this film, but in the end, that's more than enough, because Shakespeare's work is more often about the actors than the director, which might be why it does lack a more substanitive style as to not over-shadow the performances, which range from pretty great to astonishingly great.

Whedon's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING may not stand in the same circles as Olivier's HAMLET, or Branagh's HENRY V, or Polanski's (or Welles') MACBETH, but I believe it's perfectly happy just hovering around them.",1378512000,138,4911,5.055555555555555

5688698,4,B00C2A4SYA,"David Bevington has noted that the three great romantic comedies of 1599, Much Ado, What You Will(or Twelfth Night) and As You Like It, all have titles which suggest a certain off-handedness. In his greatest comedies as nowhere else Shakespeare seems to enjoy his gifts and declines to take himself too seriously. Accordingly it was very much in the spirit of things when Whedon decided to gather with friends and frequent collaborators to shoot a film of Much Ado in his home, in two weeks for as little money as possible. The result is an airy, charming, whisp of a film which gives pleasure every second it occipies the screen.

Taking place in Whedon's modern home, where characters gather over wine in the kitchen or in the garden, proceedings take on a domestic feeling in which even the larger scenes feel relatively intimate. The masque, for instance, becomes a kind of casual dinner party which fashionable people might attend. The Duke's visit feels like a meeting between friends, nothing to do with affairs of state. In Whedon's hands Shakespeare's nobles become leisured bourgoisie and the more political aspects of the play are often downplayed while the focus goes to the personal relationships between the characters. The lighting and black and white cinematography are understated and excellent.

The leads are uniformly strong but there are no revelations. Whedon has encouraged broad, physical acting, with a good deal of physical comedy. Often he keeps his actors moving; Benedick jogs athrough the garden or chases Beatrice down the stairs; Beatrice shuffles accross the room on hands and feet to escape detection as she eavesdrops. In this way Whedon maintains a certain rhythm and level of energy but it at times overwhelmes the text. The actors manage the verse well but with relatively few insights into the lines. Whedon's boldest and most successful decision was to change Conrad's gender. She and Don John engage in uncommitted and meaningless sexsuality which colors their scheme to ruin the pure love of Claudio and Hero. For Whedon they stand with many other of Shakespeare's characters (notably Iago and Lucio) who jealously wish to drag those around them into their own degraded view of love and sex. This dynamic proves incredibly compelling and insightful. Just as successful is Nathan Fillion as Dogberry. Overstuffed into a badly fitted suit and obnoxiously proud of his modest authority, he will become that security gaurd you hated at that building you worked-at/lived-in while at the same time remaining likable through his obvious earnestness. His brilliant understatemnt and timing find every laugh.

While the cast and director do not find depths of the barely averted tragedy or the lyrical hights of the characters unearned forgiveness and reconcilement, it remains full of good feeling and some genuine insight. Given the dearth of adaptatons of Shakespeare's comedies, this is more than enough reason to treasure it.",1378425600,13,2963,5.155925155925156

Joss Whedon (""The Avengers"" and Lots of TV) adapted the screenplay and directed this little black and white PG-13 gem, shot in his own personal home over a two-week period. It's really nice working with former colleagues where everybody knows everybody. During the Q&A which followed the screening of this little treasure, he said the most difficult part was working out in his yard, because the neighbors were sanding their floors, many dogs in the neighborhood were barking, and he doesn't live very far from the Santa Monica Airport.

He worked with:
  * Amy Acker (""The Cabin in the Woods"") as Beatrice, the willful woman who hasn't forgiven ""that man"" for the slight she suffered a couple of years back.
  * Alexis Denisof (""The Avengers"") is Benedick, who is every bit the misogynist Beatrice holds in such contempt, furthermore he can't bring himself to utter the ""M"" word (""Marriage"").
  * Fran Kranz (""The Cabin in the Woods"") is Claudio, the young man Benedick tries in vain to steer away from matrimony.
  * Jillian Morgese (""The Avengers"") is Hero, who makes the fourth for our two sets of star-crossed lovers.
  * Clark Gregg (""The Avengers"") is Leonato, Hero's father. He is the host for this weekend in the country that starts the ball rolling.
  * Nathan Fillion (""Castle"" and ""Firefly"") is Dogberry, Mister Malaprop, ego at full sail, with his adoring assistant echoing his every move.
  * Sean Maher (""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"") is Don John, the villain of the piece.

The entire movie has a slow, lollygagging feel to it.  The party, for example, looks positively serene....which stinks for a masquerade revelry.

In an attempt to counteract the insipid delivery of lines, the director chose to include multiple sexual scenes and innuendos beyond the norm for Shakespeare adaptations.  He also included some rather bizarre blocking choices - trying to add humor to the lines by making his characters do truly ridiculous things rather than letting the true genius and wit of Shakespeare carry the load.

A little while ago I posted an enthusiastic review of a giddy New York summer afternoon, featuring Joss Whedons version of Much Ado About Nothing. Last night I watched Kenneth Branaghs version of the same play in hopes of declaring a personal favorite. It was a merry war indeed, but I have a clear favorite.

Branagh and Thompson are wonderfully effective in the leading roles, with Emma Thompson at the very top of her extremely gifted game; she stole the show for me. (I was a little sad in truth, knowing that the two in real life would soon leave their marriage.) I didn't know any of the actors in Whedons version, and thought both leads were equally excellent. Advantage Whedon.

Branaghs version is in glorious color; Whedons in black and white. Somehow the black and white gave a feeling of authenticity to the feel of the show. Advantage Whedon.

I saw Whedon on both the small and the big screens, where the close ups gave a wonderful sense of intimacy [kudos to the director]; on the small screen, Branagh suffered a bit. If the screens had been reversed, I might have enjoyed Branagh more. See them both on big screen if you can. Draw.

Both movies are set outside of Sicily  California and Tuscany, respectively. The Branagh could actually have been anywhere albeit there are plenty of battles in Tuscany to choose from; the exterior conflicts in California were unclear. Draw.

The overall cast in Whedon was superb, especially Nathan Fillion as constable Dogberry. Branaghs cast is equally superb, but Keanu Reeves as Don John, and Michael Keaton as Dogberry seemed oddly miscast. Advantage Whedon.

Its hard to criticize the feel of either movie; whats not to like about Tuscany in the summer in full color, but I loved the home movie feeling of Whedons version. It is set in his own house, and for years he writes that he would have friend over to read Shakespeare. His entire cast seems very much at home. Advantage: Whedon.

Overall, then, two wonderful interpretations of Shakespeares most accessible comedy, but if I could have only one, Whedons is my choice.
