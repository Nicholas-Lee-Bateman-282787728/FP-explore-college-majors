Although she's very young and can easily be distracted, she sat still through the entire showing of ""Peter and the Wolf"" where Elmo was the star.  She adores Elmo and his friends and Sing Yourself Silly gets her on her feet and dancing.  She wants everyone to dance with her.  Good fun for everyone!!  This product was well worth the small investment!",1221782400,4,409,4.625

3028159,5,B000YDKA1M,"These are both great DVDs.  It's a bargain.

Silly Songs is a fun collection with many gems.  The extended Put down the Ducky is the big closer but the whole DVD is mostly A grade with maybe one A- and one B- among selections. (no grade inflation)

Elmo's adventure is a story within a story about music & cooperation.  The internal story is Peter & the Woolf done by the the Boston Pops, with Sesame Street characters, of course.  Around that is the tale about learning to cooperate.  Hats off to the crew for making the points gently without letting them get in the way of the storytelling.  My daughter followed the story before age 2, but there should be things for much older children to find & enjoy.  Backstsge scenes with Lockhart & the Pops musicians are woven into the plot to demonstrate the instruments and how an orchestra works together.",1206576000,2,851,4.546052631578948

8232451,5,B000YDKA1M,"I'm surprised by some of these reviews and thought I would share my experience. I have been an elementary music teacher for many, many years and I use this video in my classroom with kindergartners and 1st graders.

Re Sing Yourself Silly- As an educator, I don't really use this DVD. I guess it's fun for younger kids to watch and sing along with. It doesn't really serve any educational purchase, in my opinion.

Peter and the Wolf, though, is a GOLD MINE!  First, Baby Bear takes a trip to see the Boston Pops orchestra and gets to visit with (live!) musicians and see them each play their instruments (the various ""themes"" from Peter and the Wolf). Then the entire piece is played by the orchestra as Baby Bear sits in the audience with his dad. (Great info here on audience behavior, etc.) The visual is the Sesame Street friends acting out the story with live musicians/corresponding instruments- awesome! This music can get a little scary for small children, and thr video uses breaks in the action and strategically placed humor to break up that fear.  Of course, since it's Sesame Street, you can expect some little side lessons about working together, obeying the people who are watching out for you, etc. There are also some DVD extras (games, parent section, etc) that frankly, I've never used.

Perhaps the people who rated Peter and the Wolf so low are using it with kids who are too young.  My 5-7 yr olds love it!",1456963200,,1429,4.628458498023716
