William Freise-Greene a noted photographer of the day, yoused up his earnings to develop sprocketed celouloid film. At the time of his death he handed in his latest results of his results on colour film. A movie with lots of fine actors, and a must for people interested in the motion picture industry.  Thank you for allowing me to purchase such a wonderful dvd. of such fine quality.  Kind Regards  Bill Collins.",1356998400,,509,4.75
1340725,5,B00004CJHH,"I've only seen this film twice and enjoyed its underdog message. In a double feature, I'd show it with Francis Ford Coppola's TUCKER as a pair of films about dreamers who had the ideas right but were vastly under appreciated and forgotten by time. I can hardly wait until someone deems it okay to release this film to The States.",1330387200,,329,4.5
1340726,5,B00004CJHH,"Very educational and moving story of William Freise-Greene, who invented moving pictures. He was an engineer with no business acumen and was abused and victimized for the lack of it for the rest of his life. A lot of cameos several years before AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS. My Father lost an infant daughter and my Mother at age 39. He then had two patents stolen, one of them out of the patent office. This picture hurts me twice as much but it is an achievement and needs to be watched. Photographed by Jack Cardiff, the Dean of English light.",1327104000,,545,4.405940594059406

I saw it on Encore on TV.  Hope that soon it is available on a US DVD (NTSC type instead of PAL).",1242000000,5,265,3.981132075471698
1340729,5,B00004CJHH,"Robert Donat is one of my favorite actors, mostly because of the way he can deliver such a wide range of subtle feeling and emotion. I saw this film once on TV and was captivated by his performance and by the story. There's a scene near the end with him and a bobby--you'll never forget it.",1170979200,,290,4.196428571428571
1340730,5,B00004CJHH,"The haunting story of William Friese-Greene the inventor of the motion picture camera is described with a sense of pride and profound respect. Supported by a sharp and incisive script, the film deals with the hardships and disillusions through his life, the infinite patience of his wife and the epic sacrifice of his sons when decide to go to the Army to avoid him a heavy burden  to maintain.

The towering performance still remains in our memory days and days after the lights are off. The notable contribution of so many heavy weight actors  is an additive merit of this intimate chamber work. Magnificent direction of John Boulting.

Here, between you and me. I am still amazed to be the first reviewer to comment that hidden gem. Do not miss it.!",1139702400,8,752,4.717557251908397
7920394,4,B00004CJHH,"I ""streamed"" this and the quality was good despite being in SD. The color was delicate but appropriate for the time period covered, ending in 1921.
This is a biopic and covers the tribulations of an early inventor of the movie camera.
The acting by the large cast (with many ""guest"" appearances} was good.
Maltin gave this film four stars (out of four) but I am ranking it slightly less. The film is enjoyable and exhilarating in some sequences. But it is also sentimental and depressing as Fries-Greene played by Robert Donat endures many financial setbacks as does his family. He evidently was a talented photographer and could make a decent income from doing portraits. But he virtually abandoned this trade to experiment on his invention and seems to have had no business sense. He was not really honored during his lifetime but did receive posthumous recognition.
Anyone interested in the early development of photography and film should find this interesting.",1511395200,,965,5.0

7920400,4,B00004CJHH,"Much has been said in other reviews about the subject of John Boulting's biopic, the inventor William Friese-Greene, who spent his life trying to create the eponymous ""magic box"" that would show moving pictures.  Whether he was the first to do so is largely insignificant: the fact that he went largely unrecognized assumes far greater importance.

Planned to celebrate the Festival of Britain in 1951, THE MAGIC BOX recognizes the achievements of someone who spent just about everything - time, money and effort - on his work.  Director Boulting alternates between scenes in Friese Greene's (Robert Donat's) laboratory, with domestic sequences involving his wives Edith (Margaret Johnston) and Helena (Maria Schell).  Although a devoted husband, Friese-Greene is so obsessed with his work that he neglects his family; as shown in several sequences where he begins to talk excitedly about his discoveries, while remaining oblivious to his wives' complaints.  In one sequence, for example, Edith has to remind him that he has missed an important concert at which he was supposed to be the soloist; to avoid any embarrassment with the conductor (Muir Matheson), she had to fill in for him.  Sometimes his wives sacrifice their own health to support him; Helena is shown in close-up crumpling a medicinal prescription in her hand as she travels home by coach.  In her view it's far more important to encourage Friese-Greene's work than to cure her congenital heart condition.

Boulting adopts an equivocal view of Friese-Greene's work; although obviously an innovator, his obsessions caused pain and suffering in his family, and led to the break-up of profitable partnerships such as that with rich northern business person Arthur Collings (Eric Portman), which could have secured Friese-Greene's financial future.

The film is structured in double flashback, showing us how Friese-Greene's life, and enabling Donat to give a virtuoso performance in the title role.  This most underrated of British actors was particularly good at portraying tortured souls (remember GOODBYE MR. CHIPS (1939)), and he manages to communicate the pain lurking at the heart of Friese-Greene's soul, once he realizes the damage he has done to his family.  Boulting is fond of using the quick close-up to register his emotions.

As well as being a celebration of the inventor, THE MAGIC BOX celebrates the British film industry by offering roles to virtually all the major stars (and supporting actors) working in the studios at that time.  The film offers fans the pleasure of identifying people in the smallest roles, and enjoying scene-stealing cameos such as Margaret Ruthferford's irascible dowager telling Friese-Greene's first employer Guttenberg (Frederick Valk) off; Joyce Grenfell at her toothiest as a member of Edith's choral society; Sidney James and William Hartnell as a pair of World War One army personnel; and Laurence Olivier in his famous cameo as a London police officer marveling at Friese-Greene's invention.

Thematically speaking, Eric Ambler's script might be a familiar one, but that does not prevent viewers from enjoying the film as a celebration of a long-forgotten figure as well as British films as a whole.",1414022400,,3214,5.313609467455621
7920401,3,B00004CJHH,"So many Cameo and credited British actors. Parallel development of the mechanism of motion picture fundamentals, though his mechanism was too complicated. Very interesting.",1398124800,,172,6.208333333333333
7920402,4,B00004CJHH,"Robert Donat from Good by Mr. Chips  fame does great job in this movie and it is to bad that  is not shown more often !
It is also very sad movie that Mr. Greene  does not get his due credits for being a film pioneer.",1390953600,,217,3.6739130434782608
7920403,3,B00004CJHH,"The ""true"" story of William Friese Greene (Robert Donat) opens in 1921 and through a series of flashbacks, we see his struggle to bring recognition to his invention, the motion picture camera, but no one seems interested. After the credit goes to other men, notably Thomas Edison, he continues to perfect the instrument, working on the development of color film till the day of his death. It's not a particularly interesting film and it doesn't help any that Friese Greene is so obsessed with his work that he ignores his family, social and business responsibilities which makes it difficult to sympathize with him. Indeed, his selfishness is the indirect cause of his first wife's (Maria Schell) death and causes his second wife (Margaret Johnston, NIGHT OF THE EAGLE) to finally end their marriage. Surely the real Friese Greene's life couldn't have been this tedious. The Technicolor work of Jack Cardiff (BLACK NARCISSUS) is a treat though. Unexceptionally directed by John Boulting. The massive supporting cast includes Laurence Olivier, Michael Redgrave, Richard Attenborough, Glynis Johns, Margaret Rutherford, Peter Ustinov, Leo Genn, Kay Walsh, Robert Beatty, Stanley Holloway, Dennis Price, Emlyn Williams, David Tomlinson, Michael Hordern, Marius Goring, Barry Jones, Bernard Miles and Joan Hickson.

The Optimum DVD is a nice Technicolor transfer in the appropriate 1.33 ratio.",1367452800,,1389,5.430555555555555
