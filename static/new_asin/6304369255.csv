7869803,5,6304369255,"Fat guy.  Going....nutzoid.  Can it get better?  It could, only if it were about 30 minutes longer, or if they made a sequel.  Cinema doesn't get any finer than this folks.  Something that even John Waters would be proud to watch.  Get it, cherish it, and sign any petition (or start your own) to get this released on dvd, with tons (no pun intended) of extras and commentary.

Get it now though to see, as soon as you can, all the hilarity.  Especially the scene in the bathroom.",1129680000,,480,4.375
7869804,4,6304369255,"I don't understand how some people can completely diss a film based on a few amatuer flaws inherent in your typical B-movie .
This is unbelievably one of the lowest rated films on IMDB.com .
If you like ""over-the-top"" , crude toungue in cheek comedies , then you should love this !
The movie centers around 3 jewish brothers , one a paroled drug dealer , who can't hold down a job to live up to his parole requirments . Then you have Doogle , a very funny guy , ( He is played by Douglas Stone , who's face and voice were just made for comedy , and its a shame he was not cast in any other films ) who works as a camp counceler for retarded adults , one being the fat guy who  escapes and yes dous go nutzoid ! Harold , the obese third brother ,always get in the middle of the other two brother's shenanigans .
The movie begins at the funeral of the brothers' aunts, where the film puts forth some really tacky over the top humour , involving death and corpes ! This immediately sets off the mood of the film , in which depending on who you are , you immediately shut off the tape , or eagerly  watch in awe as you embark on a journey of one of the most original refreshing comedies of the 80s .",1027728000,4,1195,4.016806722689076
7869805,4,6304369255,"Directed by Troma Founder John Golden, this movie is one of those B-Movies people will either love or hate. From it's opening scenes of revelry over at the funeral of a hated relative, and scenes of mental patients whacked out on LSD, this film is at a gentler pace, but still up there with most of Troma's later output. It has always been one of my favourites. Unintentionally surreal, it has some wonderful moments - The Fat Guy gives a woman a wierd look and she assumes the worst (that he's propositioning her) and fetches some cops, upon seeing tons of money spill out of a suitcase he has swiped, she exclaims - ""I didn't know he had money"". In all, a very laid-back satire. I would like also to point out the excellent music by Leo Kottke - Trad Guitar god.",967593600,2,764,4.387323943661972
