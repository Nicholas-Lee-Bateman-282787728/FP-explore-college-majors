1657983,5,B00005RYLU,"This DVD is comprised of two previous releases by yoga instructor Rodney Yee, Yoga Practice for Energy and Yoga Practice for Strength.  Both practices are designed for those with some prior knowledge of yoga; I would say that the Energy practice is appropriate for experienced beginners and above, while Strength is designed for those on a more intermediate level.  Because both practices are broken into multiple shorter sessions, this DVD provides a huge amount of variety.

Yoga for Energy is divided into 5 separate practices which are designed to be performed throughout the day. The first, Awakening, is 9 minutes of mostly floor stretches, and it moves very slowly. The second, Centering, is 7 minutes of relatively basic standing poses and is designed to be used in the morning. The third and longest section (15 minutes) is Creativity. This section is intended to be done during the day for an energy boost, and it moves much more quickly than any of the other sections.  Although I enjoyed how Rodney flowed from one pose to the other, it moved a bit too fast for me--for example, you must very quickly move from downward dog to a standing pose such as proud warrior.  Also of note here is that you do all of the poses on one side of the body before moving to the other.  The last two segments are meant to be done together. First is Reflection, which contains 11 minutes of seated forward bends for tranquility. Finally comes Surrender, 4 minutes in relaxation pose. This is the only time which Rodney provides detailed instruction, as he leads you through a guided relaxation.  For the three middle sections, Rodney has 1 or 2 others performing the routine along with him.

In Yoga Practice for Strength, Rodney Yee offers 2 practices of less than 30 minutes each; the first is designed to prepare for inversions, particularly headstand, whereas the second consists of balance work, including arm balances.  The first practice begins with several vinyasa sequences. Rodney slowly builds up to a full sun salutation and then adds additional poses such as triangle and side angle; I loved that he moved slowly and held each pose for a long period. After the 16-minute vinyasa segment, Rodney goes through 20-minutes of inversion work. He starts by working in down dog, first doing a bent arm down dog (tough!) and then holding down dog for two minutes; both of these moves are designed to build strength. Next, he practices bridge pose and then moves into a shoulderstand and plow sequence using a chair and a strap. He finishes with a reclined leg stretch and a very short savasana. Rodney begins the second practice with a vinyasa warm-up, moving through the vinyasa twice and including a beginning balance posture, side plank. He then works on standing poses for balance: triangle, side angle, half moon, forward bend, tree, warrior 1, forward bend with feet apart, warrior 3. He did not hold the poses as long as in the first program, but he still moves slowly and precisely. Rodney then moves to the floor for more challenge postures, including boat, pendulum, and crane pose. Although I couldn't do pendulum, Rodney showed how to modify with blocks, and he made me feel that I could get there eventually. Rodney ends with a reclined twist and savasana, bringing the total practice time for this session in at about 23 minutes (Rodney spends additional time talking between sections).  Yoga Practice for Strength is perfect for intermediate yogis wanting to build up to more challenging postures.

If you crave variety in your yoga practice, you can't go wrong with this DVD, which features some of the best of what Rodney Yee has to offer.  Highly recommended!",1122854400,13,3676,4.864
1657984,5,B00005RYLU,"These yoga practices have long been available on VHS.  I've been working with Yoga for Strength for over 10 years and it remains one of my favorite recorded yoga sessions.  It includes 2 sequences, one focusing on inversions (just over 1/2 hour) and the other on arm balances (just under 1/2 hour).  The instruction is detailed and careful in the Iyengar manner and Yee's form is impeccable.

Yoga for Energy has been on VHS for almost as long and it's another long-standing favorite.  It contains 5 short (5 min. to 15 min.) sequences that correspond stages in the day, starting with a lovely gentle warm up, an energizing balance flow, a vigorous full body routine including wheel, a relaxing series of seated forward bends and final relaxation.  Instruction is minimal so this one isn't for those new to yoga.

The combination of these 2 practices on one DVD is really hard to beat.  Seems like a natural balance to me.

I've been practicing yoga for over 10 years, supplementing my home practice with Iyengar and Anusara classes.",1103760000,7,1033,4.790960451977401
1657985,5,B00005RYLU,"This DVD includes two very different workouts that have both become staples in my practice. Yoga for Energy is a perfect am workout, slowly warming up the body, progressing into more challenging vinyasa (flowing sequences) and ending with deep stretches to relax and calm the body. It is well balanced between flexion and extension and covers all the movements of the spine. Note that you will need to be familiar with the poses to follow this workout. Yoga for Strength is a slower, deeper workout developing muscle strength, balance and stability. It is appropriate for all levels and includes some introductory inversions.",1061337600,24,625,5.137254901960785
1657986,4,B00005RYLU,"I love Rodney Yee! He is so refreshing and inspirational. My favorite part of this DVD is the ""Yoga for Energy"" practice. There have been weeks when I have done this practice every single day. It never disappoints. I really like the lack of verbal instruction (although it does help if you are familiar with the poses before doing this practice) and the simple format. I like that the practice is balanced and very inclusive. You work every part of your body during this practice. It is helpful that he has an appendix of useful modifications for people at the end of this section. It is worthwhile to watch the entire 45-minute practice first, before trying it along with Rodney and friends. The ""Yoga for Strength"" section is also excellent and provides a good way to learn many of the poses before moving on to the more flowing Energy practice.
I think it is perfect for the person who has had a few classes or done a beginner tape and is ready to establish a daily routine.",1057190400,15,977,4.52542372881356
1657987,2,B00005RYLU,"Perhaps someone more advanced would have a different opinion, but as a person fairly new to yoga, I cannot recommend this program.
Aside from the fact that many of the moves are just plain impossible for a novice, there are other faults:  The directions are very limited, the breath pattern that he seems to follow just doesn't seem realistic or at least even and steady, and I don't enjoy having to sit through or FF through 7 minutes of him showing off at the beginning of the dvd.  And as the other reviews stated, there are no chapters, so we've basically paid for a dvd with all the limitations of a vhs tape.  I think this one will be collecting some dust on my shelf.",1014768000,12,674,4.376
1657988,3,B00005RYLU,"I'm a 3rd Dan Taekwondo practitioner who uses yoga as an excellent adjunct to my study,and practise yoga at an intermediate level. While I LOVE the material and it's presentation in the discs, I must agree with the comments from ""Philadelphia"" regarding the lack of DVD chapters that would actually optimize the use of the vinyasas,especially the Energy cycle as it tracks through the day. I purchased the DVD because I figured the DVD version made such technologic options available-wrong! It's actually easier to use the VHS, as I can readily park the tape where I want to start the next session,instead of a total restart,as on DVD. While Rodney and his material rate 5 stars,the DVD issues drop it to 3 for me. Come out with REAL DVD, Living Arts, and I'll buy it..... hey, anybody out there know what the music used in the Centering section is from? I'm sure it's Peter Davison, but don't know which CD..... -pajcastle@axom.com",1012348800,23,932,4.795031055900621

7952851,5,B00005RYLU,"I have been using this DVD forever! In fact, I had it on VHS before I bought it on DVD! Rodney Yee is great, the background music isn't bothersome, and even if you aren't a big yoga buff you can still do the basics! Rodney Yee does a great job of putting basic moves together and also doing the intermediate ones when appropriate! If you want to try yoga, or even if you are into it already... this DVD is a must have!",1354665600,,418,4.048192771084337
7952852,3,B00005RYLU,"I really like Rodney Yee as a video instructor, but this video was a bit slow. the movements were pretty basic and I would recommend it for beginners but not imtermediate yogis!",1249257600,,177,4.5625

Love this DVD!  Gets me moving, energized and centered for my day.  Would not want to be without it.  I would recomend Gaiam's DVD to everybody but to have a Rodney Yee DVD makes it all the more special.  Go and get Centered, you will find that once you try these DVD from Gaiam with Rodney, you'll never want to go a day without.",1247097600,,534,6.162162162162162
7952854,1,B00005RYLU,"It's really strange -- the poses and sequences, and the pace at which Yee does them, seem to suggest that this is for someone who's done little or no yoga before. His pacing is really uneven -- he sometimes says ""inhale, exhale"" very abruptly before changing poses, but then when he's moving from standing forward bend up to mountain pose, it takes about 15 bizarrely long seconds. He doesn't talk about pacing yourself with your breath at all. I have done a lot of yoga, so I generally know where my hips are supposed to be, that my shoulders should stay down when reaching overhead, etc., but he doesn't talk you through those things at all, so beginners would probably be tottering all over the place. And he uses strange terms for things -- what I've always heard called ""extended side triangle pose"" he calls ""side stretch pose."" Very unsatisfying DVD -- not surprised they stopped producing it.",1233273600,,900,4.7025316455696204
7952855,5,B00005RYLU,"I came on here looking for the DVD version and could not find it. I have had this tape for years and use the Energy section for a flexibility workout. I love the way the sequence flows. Watching Rodney and the women is like watching a beautiful dance and it is soothing as a meditation. It makes me feel like a beautiful dancer as well! It always leaves me balanced and uplifted and blissed.
I hope they release this on DVD soon. My tape is getting worn.",1204761600,,454,4.2298850574712645
7952856,4,B00005RYLU,"...and I only got through the first session!

I've been practicing yoga for about 2 months now and definitely consider myself a beginner.  However, I was looking for something to increase my strength through yoga.  I preveiwed the DVD first and then performed session 1 this morning.  *WOW*

I really like the way Yee holds the poses in session 1 for a long time.  I couldn't make it through the entire 2 minutes of downward dog, but this gives me something to practice toward achievement.  I've actually done a shoulderstand in yoga class, but only once and I don't think I performed it correctly via this DVD.  I would think if one has a bad back or a strain, one should skip this portion of the DVD until one works with a yoga practitioner that can assist with proper posing.  Incidentally, the Downward Dog pose where you bend your elbows is TOUGH!  While these are only performed 3 times, I only made it twice - and barely at that!  One of the last poses of session 1 is where we take our leg (with or without a strap, depending on your flexiblity) and move your leg on the outside of the body and then across.  A bit challenging, but what a great stretch.  I really felt my hips open up.

Rodney Yee is quickly becoming one of my favorite yoga masters.  I've viewed several of his tapes and have enjoyed them all.  His voice is clear and soothing; his instruction is great and he is in great shape.

If you're a beginner who has the courage to try a more stenous yoga practice, then I recommend this DVD.  It's a nice alternative to building flexibility and meditation.  I practiced this DVD this morning and I feel as though I can take on anything work has to throw at me.  It also gives me a goal - to finish both sessions at one shot!  It will take time, but I'll get my money's worth out of this DVD!",1134950400,3,1810,4.311572700296736
