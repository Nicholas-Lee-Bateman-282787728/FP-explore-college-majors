8404755,1,B001CQ5FG0,"As a diehard Virginia Cavaliers football fan, I had great hopes for this DVD. Too bad. It turns out to be a repackage of ""video rookie cards"" of some UVa players who went on to the NFL in the 1990s-early 2000s. Heath Miller is here, and Tiki Barber (but not Ronde). Chris Long is not. Chris Canty is. In any event, the video quality is low-def (looks like transfer from tape to digital format). The same insipid voiceover accompanies each player's section. What you get, basically, is a series of 10 minute game film clips of touchdowns and great runs, but without any context or meaningful commentary. Even I couldn't watch this thing, and as I said, I'm pretty much a diehard.",1269820800,,678,4.565573770491803
