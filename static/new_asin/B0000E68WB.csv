8001990,5,B0000E68WB,"I have loved the 350Z since it debuted. So when i saw the BMI DVD for it, i was excited. I didn't know all that much about the Z and it's capabilities, so watching this was great. I learned about the Z and then i saw how it acted on track both as stock, and highly tuned. This is one of my favorite BMI volumes. And there's more to the DVD than just talking about the Z, BMI is very good at changing things up and having multiple things to show you to keep it exciting. Anyways, this was very good. I recommend it to anyone who likes the Z.",1305504000,,540,3.918181818181818
8001991,5,B0000E68WB,"Every Best Motoring has been awesome, but this one is equal or better than the best.  A wide variety of cars, from the new 350Z comparison with the Boxter, M3, S2k, and a Skyline, to the NA vs. Turbo challenge, a B-series race, and a few NA Toyotas just for fun.  Great variety of cars and racing leads to an overall great DVD.",1100908800,2,327,4.174603174603175
8001992,5,B0000E68WB,"I was kinda ho hum about the rambling on and on about the Z. and all the reviews. If you love the 350Z then deffently get this!
I love it for all the extras. The Silvia's vs. the VTECs and the Touge racing make up for the hour of Z specs and racing. The battle was cool I guess.",1073088000,,278,3.7288135593220337
