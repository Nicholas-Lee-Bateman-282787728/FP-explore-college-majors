It says English subtitles, but doesn't have them and won't play with subtitles having tried on 3 different players! I wasted my $!",1426809600,,245,4.72093023255814
8610146,3,B00EX1BWK4,"Remember My Best Friend's Wedding? At first sight the story of a Chinese-South Korean co-production A Wedding Invitation looks like that of the Julia Roberts romantic comedy made in 1997, but there is a huge difference that you may find interesting.

An aspiring ceramic artist Qiao Qiao (Bai Baihe) and Li Xing (Eddie Peng), who wants to be a cook, have been dating for five years since they were in high school. One day Li Xing asks Qiao Qiao to marry, but she says no. Qiao Qiao thinks they should pursue their professional career, so if they are still single, she promises, then they should marry.

Cue to five years later. Qiao Qiao, still single, receives a call from Li Xing, who says he is going to marry another woman, beautiful, rich and kind-hearted Zhou Rei (Pace Wu). Unset Qiao Qiao sets out to change his mind, enlisting her gay friend Mao Mao (Jiang Jinfu) for help.

Then, about half into the story, something happens. Without revealing too much about it, I can only say that the film takes an unexpected turn, changing its tone from romantic comedy to something very sentimental.

The leading players are both good, especially Bai Baihe as Qiao Qiao, who is unpredictable and even enigmatic, but I find the storytelling heavy-handed, and the second half maudlin and manipulative. And manipulative in a heavy-handed way. This is by no means a terrible film, but still needs better storytelling.",1397347200,,1411,4.818181818181818
