8218177,5,B000VD5I9E,"This is the tale of an illiterate camel boy from a family deserted by his father when he was very young. He develops an obsession with Bollywood star Booby Deol (played by himself) as an imaginary friend and father figure. Through this friendship he grows in wisdom.
This is a charming little movie (short for Bollywood at under 2 hours). The setting, used to full advantage, is in an ancient looking town in the desert. The little boy is the main star and focus of the movie and he is endearing and terrific in his portrayal of the camel boy.
Bobby Deol is also good (even if he really takes a secondary role to the boy). I have a soft spot for Bobby Deol and in this he brings the open smile and gentle warmth in his eyes, and a light comic touch at times, that are right for the part. He relates well with the boy. I have read criticisms that he wasn't a big enough star for a boy to get that hung up on him. I don't think that matters to the movie and anyway how many of us have been drawn to 'lesser' actors as ones to follow.
This isn't a movie of great drama. While there are a few dance pieces and songs woven in they aren't a big focus (and come in mostly in the context of a Bobby Deol movie). The music is Ok but not that memorable.
There were 2 of us watching this of different age groups and we both give it a 5- particularly because of the boy and the wisdom and charm of the movie.",1230595200,,1396,4.061594202898551
