7844359,3,6303364381,"I found the plot inane and if you don't care for rather explicit sex, it's somewhat tedious. Rutger as a young man was gorgeous but the plot is very much of a kind with some of the Beatles movies of really being too ""hip"" for words. It pretty much is about sex, sex and more sex with ridiculous older people and completely improbable situations.

This movies was a terrific hit in The Netherlands when it came out, but frankly all it has is sex and pathetic characters.",1360713600,,469,4.390804597701149
7844360,4,6303364381,"Yeah, ya gotta buy this film -- if you can find it.

You buy it because it has the most romantic scene ever filmed.  And no, it's not the sex scenes (which are often).

I'll give you a hint:  It's pouring rain. Late afternoon.  No umbrella.  She's sitting on the curb in front of a cafe, soaking wet.  She's smiling up at the rain, her wet hair clinging to the sides of her beautiful face.  He comes out of the cafe with two glasses of wine.  He is laughing.  He is soaked.  The glasses of wine are filling with rain.  He sits behind her, locking his legs around her.  They both look up as the rain pours down on them, and laugh.  They are so in love, nothing matters -- not the pouring rain, not the diluted wine -- only that they are together.

And then ending will rip your heart out.",1265932800,4,787,4.0855263157894735
