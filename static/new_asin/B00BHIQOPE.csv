8568520,5,B00BHIQOPE,Great Movie!!  The only thing I wish I understood was the end.  Where did she decide to go?  It was not clear maybe someone can clarify that me lol.,1485734400,,148,4.0344827586206895
8568521,5,B00BHIQOPE,"Great drama, surprisingly good for Indian cinema.  I found no resemblance with the movie Disclosure, as the other reviewer commented.  It does remind me of the Mad Men, because of the settings and dynamics between the characters.  As someone who worked in this industry, I found this movie to be very true to what it is trying to portray.  Despite some beautiful exotic settings, and gorgeous lead actors, the movie did not feel foreign to me at all.  I highly recommend to watch if you starve for a well written and well acted drama.",1478476800,,534,4.638297872340425
8568522,2,B00BHIQOPE,Demi Moore and Michael Douglas did an American version of this movie.  It should have stayed at that.  Erotic Thrillers are still something that the Desi world needs to work on to perfect.,1386028800,2,188,4.666666666666667
