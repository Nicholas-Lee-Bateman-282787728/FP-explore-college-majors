8368882,5,6303431089,This is a wonderful series.  I am disappointed that it has not been made available on DVD -- not yet anyway.,1306195200,4,108,4.142857142857143
8368883,5,6303431089,"This 5-part documentary series is the best that was -- or ever will be -- produced about the Watergate scandal. It includes incredible and often jaw-dropping interviews with many of the top conspirators -- Haldeman, Hunt, Erlichman, Liddy to name a few -- as well as dozens of others who played key roles in the dicovery, investigation, and prosecution of the high crimes and misdemeanors. Watching this, you will finally grasp the gravity and scope of what went on. Little new has been learned since the series was produced, making this a timeless timeless history of the era.",1101081600,7,577,4.8979591836734695
8368884,5,6303431089,"This video makes for compulsive viewing.  Its unrivalled.  Worth every penny.  You will not be disappointed.  I have sold you yet?
I remember first seeing this series on the BBC with Fred Emery doing the narration.  So not surprisingly this BBC production is magnificent.  Well structured - with plenty of first hand interviews. The interviews make the video.  Having said this, there is plenty of commentary that gives this collection of tapes perfect flow.
Anyone interested in US contemorary history just has to see these tapes.  Even if you have to buy these second hand - don't worry just do it!  You will not be disappointed.",990921600,6,631,4.877358490566038
