7385508,5,B0148RAIRU,"Very good movie.  One heck of a twisted messed up plot, in a very good way.  Full of surprises and suspense.  Would definitely watch this movie again and then I am sure again.",1443830400,2,175,4.242424242424242
7385509,2,B0148RAIRU,DON'T do it!  Apparently the viewers who gave it 5 stars are either friends of the cast or crew OR they watched a different movie than I did.  It was a B rated movie but with an added zing.  Good for free on cable but I want my money back,1443830400,3,238,3.72
7385510,5,B0148RAIRU,"As far as Horror movies are concerned, this one is great entertainment for an independent film. Lance Henriksen is a legend of the genre, and here you can see why. Make up effects are very well done, locations are perfect, acting is good and the storyline is commendable. I was getting tired of the same old Hollywood horror, which is full of cheese and bad effects. This one, with a limited budget makes a much better job.",1443571200,5,423,4.5064935064935066
7385511,5,B0148RAIRU,Excellent and it will not disappoint people who like the walking dead .,1443571200,3,71,4.538461538461538
7385512,4,B0148RAIRU,"The first half of the movie was boring,but the second half was creepy & disturbing. Overall,it was a pretty good movie.",1443225600,3,119,4.714285714285714
7385513,4,B0148RAIRU,"If you like ghost horror movies, you may enjoy Dark Awakening. The soundtrack is great, some very creepy sound effects too. The movie has a dreary look to it as well. The story line is pretty basic, but has a nice twist near the end. The ghost children reminded me of Children Of The Corn in some ways. I found the scenes with the old folks very creepy at times. Did I mention it has Lance Henriksen? A fun one, worth a look just in time for Halloween. From the director Of Coffin Baby!",1442966400,8,486,4.180851063829787
7385514,1,B0148RAIRU,"A completely disgusting attempt to use children as the ghostly evil in a house occupied by a down-on-his-luck lawyer, his wife and son. Yes, I've seen other movies in this genre, but this particular plot line was terrible. Their six-year-old son is vulnerable to the evil, and it's really stupid that a priest, played well by Lance Henriksen, didn't have enough nerve to warn them. The parents continued to patronize everything the boy tried to tell them, including an imaginary friend who was the ghost of a child. Well, I decided to give the movie a chance and saw it through. Toward the end, it explodes in bloody violence. I suggest that you forget this movie.",1442966400,9,664,4.732758620689655
7385515,4,B0148RAIRU,"This was a fantastic film right up until the very end, then the idiot director destroyed it.",1442966400,2,92,4.470588235294118
7385516,1,B0148RAIRU,"What a waste of time. The movie actually started out with that great suspense fear factor. As the movie proceeds you quickly start wondering.. where are the writers going with this movie. Parts of the movie I think were just pulled from the air to fill time. The entire population of a small town would never act such as the one in this movie. If this was a sci-fi.. that's one thing. But this isn't a sci-fi.

You continue watching.. nothing makes sense.. and then when the movie's story line is tied up for the ending.. you truly just want to throw the remote across the room. TERRIBLE. Worse than terrible. This movie should have been canned before it even filmed. There is no redeeming value of this movie.

I would not recommend watching even if it is free.. much less paying the $4.99 rental fee we did. Pure Junk.

Try not to be tempted. Walk away. Save your time and money and move on to another movie.",1456531200,,910,4.404761904761905
7385517,5,B0148RAIRU,"Dark Awakening is a creepy, ghost story with a twist! Lance Henriksen character builds on the suspense aspect. If your a fan of The Shining, Poltergeist, Paranormal Activity, or Children of the Corn make sure to check this film out!",1454803200,,232,4.825

I do recommend this for a great scary movie, I purchased it for my library was so cool!",1446163200,3,247,4.276595744680851
7385523,2,B0148RAIRU,"Love Lance Henriksen, but did not like the movie and how it ended, I know it was a horror flick, but no hope at the end made it not likable for me.",1446076800,,147,3.625
7385524,2,B0148RAIRU,"Not the absolute worst movie I have seen.  I hate when people do stupid illogical things though, and the actions of some of the characters just begged for them to die.  Women are smarter than that, sorry...",1445644800,,206,4.54054054054054
7385525,3,B0148RAIRU,"Decent horror movie with the exception of an overabundance of brutality and the lead actress, who is just terrible. Also, the sound quality os not professional, the dialogue isn't mixed well.",1445472000,2,191,5.193548387096774

7385531,4,B0148RAIRU,"Pretty good for an indie film. A disturbing southern gothic tale of how certain people, who seems level headed and family oriented on the surface, are really not what they seem.",1444176000,2,177,4.741935483870968
7385532,1,B0148RAIRU,"Ok if you're a horror buff. To me, this movie resembles everything that went wrong with horror movies in the 80's. Just like The Blair witch project set the tone for fakeumentary docudrama. Sorry if this offends anyone. Don't let my opinion change your mind about watching it, but I would wait til it's free. Just sayin",1444176000,,319,4.614035087719298
7385533,3,B0148RAIRU,Not as scary as I thought.,1444176000,,26,3.5
7385534,2,B0148RAIRU,Not much there.  It would fit right in with most of the B-movies from the SyFy Channel.  Pass on this one.,1444176000,,106,4.0
7385535,2,B0148RAIRU,"I rarely take the time to leave bad reviews, however, this was really, really bad. Discovering it was filmed in soft focus for some reason (except for the B roll, oddly enough) was my first clue that this was not going to be as good as the other reviewers said (a horror? In soft focus?). I really don't know if they got this movie confused with another film or if what another reviewer said was true: that the good reviews were the filmmakers friends.  Everything from the dialogue, acting (except for the priest- I don't know how they got him) bad props and unfocused plot line was just... not good. This movie had no style or substance and took itself way too seriously for what the filmmakers were capable of.
Perhaps the $4 I spent on it will be used for a better prop frog for the next film.

Gets two stars just because the makeup was pretty great. Way better than a movie of this caliber should have had.

I want my money and my 90 minutes back.",1443916800,5,953,4.312849162011173

8730070,2,B0148RAIRU,"James (Jason Cook) and Jennifer (Valerie Azlynn) inherit his mother's North Carolina home in Cedar Rock Falls. They plan to fix it up and leave the odd town that has no children...just ghosts of children. Their six year old son Danny (William Pifer) develops many ""imaginary friends.""

Fairly predictable mystery with the midpoint clues.  The soundtrack and acting gave the production a ""made for TV"" feel. We don't actually see much of the action. We hear a noise and then see a messy room. We do get to see a glass fall over and Valeris Azlynn hold her head under water.  Watchable and forgettable.
