3493709,5,B001BL6QEG,"My boys love this dvd.  I would much rather them watch the old Alvin & the Chipmunks than the ones that came out in the movies the past years.  (Actually I don't allow them to watch the new ones.)  Plus the dvd reminds me of when I used to watch it on Saturday mornings when I was little.  I do with the dvds would be released in season formats.  I did not notice the song replacements, etc that other reviewers had a problem with... I wonder if that means I'm not a true fan.",1312848000,,476,4.0212765957446805

3493711,3,B001BL6QEG,This one was ok I guess but was missing 2 great Alvin episodes that should've been in it.  The Berlin wall epissode  and the one when he loses his  luckey hat.  Those 2 have history.  I was Tres dissapointed not to find them here.,1244419200,,230,4.136363636363637
3493712,5,B001BL6QEG,"For someone like me who grew up in the 80s and spent many a Saturday morning planted in front of the television watching the latest antics of Alvin Seville, this DVD is simply a treat!  It includes episodes from the first 80s ""Alvin and The Chipmunks"" cartoon (by that I mean the show with the intro with Alvin surfing in the tub).  Some of the episodes are fan faves (i.e. ""Romancing Miss Stone"") but all are enjoyable and will send you straight back to your childhood.  The last episode on the second disc is the sole inclusion from the second ""Alvin and The Chipmunks"" cartoon (the white limo intro); I wish the episode included had been my favorite Chipmunk episode -- the one about the Berlin Wall (please release this, Mr. Bagdasarian!) -- but this is still a great set.

In a perfect world, they'd release EVERY Chipmunk episode in complete, unedited season sets; I'm sure I don't fully comprehend all the legal issues of copyright and syndication which may prevent this from happening, but I know more than a few ""Alvin and The Chipmunks"" fans who would be eternally grateful if this did happen! (I've already bought all the other Chipmunk DVDS after seeing this one -- how could I not?? FYI, please put out another set of Chippette episodes as well as one with ""The Chipmunk Reunion"" in a special set!)

The best thing about this series isn't the music -- yes, it has it's kitschy appeal, but what makes this series enjoyable for grown up ex-kids is that the writing is remarkably well-done.  There are many cartoon from my childhood which I can't watch as an adult because the storylines are too frenetic or thin to hold a grown up's attention span. ""Alvin and The Chipmunks"", mercifully, holds up quite well, largely because it's written like a traditional sitcom.  A treat for the whole family!",1242604800,5,1806,4.660377358490566
3493713,1,B001BL6QEG,"to the company that is releasing these, i think its better to try to gather all episodes and release these as Season Sets. it will really make true FANS happy like myself. i don't see whats the point to release a few episodes here and there with no initial order. please look into trying to release these my Seasons. it will definate make people really happy.",1238630400,2,359,4.454545454545454
3493714,3,B001BL6QEG,"Overall, it's a good collection of selected Chipmunk episodes.  The downside to this set is it is not a season set.  What's sucks about this set is the price.  For 14 episodes I think the DVD should have cost only $9.99 instead of $19.99.  Try to find it for cheap or used.",1223942400,,273,4.1923076923076925
3493715,4,B001BL6QEG,"This is a nice collection of episodes that I can recommend to all Chipmunk fans (but personally I would like to have the episode ""Grounded Chipmunk"" included). But there are some quirks though: There are no title cards, making the episodes start abruptly after the theme song. But for some wierd reason, the very last episode on Disc 2, ""Cadet's Regrets"", have the title card intact. Every episode starts with the theme song, but they have used the older opening (with Alvin surfing in the bathtub etc.) through the whole collection, even on newer episodes which originally had the ""white limousine"" opening. The cover also states that some music have been changed, but I couldn't spot the changes (as opposed to the very blatant change of ""Love Potion #9"" to ""Witch Doctor"" on the Chipmunks Valentines DVD). Quality of sound and picture was acceptable.",1223078400,8,853,4.930555555555555
3493716,3,B001BL6QEG,"Disc 1 has a Orginization problem. When you do the ""Play All"" feature, it would play the opening and a 12 minute cartoon and no second one like it was aired in 1983. ""The curse of Lan tiki"" had a song replacement as it is stated on the back of the package. No clean up or restoration to the first early episodes or TITLE CARDS for any of the cartoons EXCEPT for the Camep Eagleton Show... What is the deal with that???

Disc 2 cartoons are more orginized and left alone in terms of cover songs... Peramount is doing better but they need to get off their duff and get the discs orginized... I hope that paramount gets enough funds to keep the covers in future releases... This would make chipmunk fans really happy...",1221696000,6,716,4.343283582089552

8283456,1,B001BL6QEG,"For decades on end, fans of the Alvin & the Chipmunks cartoon series (which ran for 8 seasons on NBC from 1983-1990) have been waiting for a box set or a series of season-by-season releases like the Transformers, G.I. Joe., Thundercats, and every other cartoon series of note from the period has done....but NO, all we get are little piecemeal ""theme"" releases...a collection of Valentine's episodes, a collection of fairy tale episodes, a collection of sci-fi episodes...all consisting of about 3-5 clips each, from various incarnations of the show's run, differing animation styles, in no particular order, sloppy DVD organization and transitions, no special features....Why?!?  Do the Bagdasarians not have the rights to all of their own material?  Are they not confident that DVDs released the right way - season by season like every other successful show with a nostalgic fan base - will sell?  What gives?  Why do they continue to torture their fans with mediocre, corny releases like this?  Why has does the Chipmunk Adventure seem to be re-released on DVD every couple of years or so with new cover art?  Get it together and stop playing games.",1392768000,34,1152,5.036842105263158
