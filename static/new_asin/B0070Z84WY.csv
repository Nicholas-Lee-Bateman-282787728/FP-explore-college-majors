Also, if you buy it direct from Chef Todd's company on Amazon.com, he will send you bonus items and other goodies that you won't get from other re-sellers.

Chef Todd is a joy to learn from. I have always cooked at home, but never really understand what I was doing past following recipes. Chef Todd shows you the techniques you need to cook like the pros do - using items you already have on-hand. Everything is explained very simply and demonstrated so you know exactly what to do. You feel like he is right there cooking with you in the kitchen. He is different from normal ""celebrity chefs"" because he truly has a passion for teaching you to cook and focuses on the science of cooking rather than just showing you how to make a few specific meals. I would highly recommend this DVD set for any cook looking to take their cooking to the next level and bring more delicious and healthy meals to their family's dinner table.",1381104000,,1160,4.446009389671362
8507906,3,B0070Z84WY,"I think he does a decent job of teaching you how to be creative and come up with your own dishes on a very simply way example: southwest chicken green peppers and cilantro etc. When talking about all cooking techniques, he mentions deep frying and that it is ""too messy, dangerous and unhealthy"" so he skips it why? because he doesn't like to deep fry that's why. The movies are low budget and very 80's looking. I do think there is some content of value, just buy them used or very cheap and spend your money on Jacques Pepin DVD's or ""Cooking A to Z"" DVD set which I bought and found both to be very comprehensive and actually worth the money. And once you get on the mailing list expect email every other day until you cancel. Too bad this guy doesn't focus on content and video quality as much as he does mass marketing.",1358812800,2,824,4.288461538461538
