2453956,5,B000C8STWQ,I loved this movie. The views of Tuscany make me want to go back! The story is well done and the acting is wonderful! Although it is the landscape that takes my breathe away!,1136764800,7,174,4.147058823529412
2453957,5,B000C8STWQ,"Absolutely loved this movie. Its a movie that the whole family can watch together. It's clean, funny, sad and romantic all at the same time! Definitely buying it once its out! A beautiful movie!",1134518400,6,194,4.735294117647059
2453958,5,B000C8STWQ,An Outstanding movie for all that share a Love for each other. A must see movie!!,1132099200,6,81,4.125
2453959,5,B000C8STWQ,"I loved this film. It had romance, it had sadness and it was funny! Although Josh and Claire didn't have much scenes together, they had great chemistry especially the scene where they are dancing to the romantic ballad, Sway by Dean Martin! I can't wait till the film comes out on DVD!",1132012800,5,285,4.5
2453960,5,B000C8STWQ,Great feel good movie.  The background of Tuscany is exceptional.  Jackson & Keitel have great timing together.  Definately worth the watch.,1131926400,4,140,5.571428571428571

2453963,5,B000C8STWQ,"This Movie is worth 5 stars because it was truly full of Love, honesty, truth and courage in the true Italian way.  Not full of boloney, the Hollywood way of telling a story.  The ""Shadows in the Sun"" story has soul!  Thank you writers and thank you actors.",1510099200,,257,4.3125
2453964,5,B000C8STWQ,"Liked it very much. the peaceful life of countryside italy and great actors and a story that seemed plausible with redemption of a lost expression of a natural talent as the stakes to be lost or won.., also a nice little love story was playing at a low key pace throughout.",1506297600,,273,4.372549019607843

2453966,2,B000C8STWQ,"Boring. Plot-less. Predictable. The one good thing about this movie is the acting. But in the future, let's stay away from attempting an Italian accent, shall we? You know who you are.",1504483200,,184,4.78125

2453969,5,B000C8STWQ,"Ha. This was just as good the second time through.  Maybe not a new storyline, but certainly well handled. Great actors and a pleasant script with lots of warm and well developed characters.  And I will watch it a third time in the not too distant future.",1489622400,,255,4.404255319148936
2453970,5,B000C8STWQ,Great movie,1489622400,,11,5.0
2453971,5,B000C8STWQ,"Great feel-good movie, as warm as a Tuscan sun and satisfying as a superb wine.  Some themes are timeless and universal, yet new each time they are experienced.  The photography and setting are beautiful, the actors play real characters, the plot is actually deeper than it first appears.  Will this be the first movie you've watched with an evolving love story or the struggle to overcome fear and self-doubt?  Probably not.  But do you want to settle in with a nice glass of wine for a couple of hours and feel good when it's done?  Give this one a try.",1486598400,,555,4.5
2453972,5,B000C8STWQ,Wow! Such a Beautiful and Touching Story! Everything in a movie I enjoy. The gorgeous scenery as well as the actors and story will captivate you! I was transported completely into their world. I LOVED IT.,1486252800,,204,4.694444444444445
2453973,2,B000C8STWQ,"What a disappointment! The basic storyline, Harvey Keitel's choice as the blocked writer, the setting in rural Italy, all offered wonderful opportunities for an excellent film that combined equal doses of deep thought and humor. Instead, we got the shallowest of thinking and the tritest of situations to present a plot that was incapable of leaving the ground. The only instances of imagination in use involved an embarrassing daydream where Italian workers become ballet dancers, and another instance of a quartet of singers offering a pathetic rendition of ""walk like a man."" Even Keitel, whose acting I generally consider exceptionally good, totally failed to deliver the goods in this movie. Out of  respect for the theme, location, and Keitel's presence, I was going to give this film a passing grade of 3 stars. But it really does not deserve it. It should be fully exposed for the cinematic failure it really is. 2 stars.",1486080000,,929,5.032467532467533

2453978,1,B000C8STWQ,"I have rarely seen such a collection of hackneyed lines and predictable story lines acted out by established actors in a major studio movie. The only surprise or originality about the story is what cliche they would leave out.  Keitel can't make up his mind if his character is Vincent Van Gogh or Zorba the Greek. When Harvey Keitel's character is crying in anguish over his typewriter trying to make a cogent sentence where is his whore daughter to give him encouragement and help? Prancing around the village in her tight jeans (which seems to be her main occupation). The London-based  young editor and his boss, the priest, the innkeeper - all boiler plate characters.",1484179200,,673,4.843478260869565

scenery is beautiful and I enjoyed the cast of characters -- plus being a writer, it put a little spin on what's been buzzing around in my head as I have been dragging my feet on the third book in my series.

2454000,2,B000C8STWQ,"I'm surprised by the number of positive reviews which prompted me to rent this movie. The acting was good and the scenery was wonderful but the story line was perpetually and most annoyingly contrived.  It was difficult to believe the characters with such poor script development.  The quality cast I felt did their best to keep the movie flowing in a believable way but the script was constantly failing them.  The ending was the clincher for me. Obviously many were left with a 'feel good feeling' but I unfortunately found the contrived 1950's Hollywood feel good ending romantically RIDICULOUS!!

One reviewer stated the movie was 'vulgar'.  Really?  Were they watching it from the Convent? There was was almost no sexual interaction and what there was wouldn't have been any different from what you see on network TV these days.....if that.

Really wanted to love this but it just lacked continuity due to a very immature script.",1468800000,,934,4.948717948717949

2454026,2,B000C8STWQ,"I seem to be one of the only ones that did not like this film. The setup took too long and the personal connections between the characters were very boring. While the individual acting was not that bad, somehow the characters don't come together very well. The main character (the author) had a personality that was way overdone . One only needs to watch the first 5 minutes and the last 10. Weak story line.",1460592000,,408,4.453333333333333

2454055,5,B000C8STWQ,Good god were the characters heartwarming. It's not a groundbreaking film but in its own subtle way it is very good! You end up watching the movie because of the characters and not the plot. And in the end she goes after the guy by riding out to meet him on the train. Take that Disney and their movie Frozen!

My wife asks me to pull it out once in a while to watch together. The acting is well done, mixed depending on the actors/actresses, but I find this to be a fun flick with some cool themes, ideas through out. Definitely worth the price and the repeated viewings.

It is more of a coming of age in a more transcendent way of a wannabe writer caught up in the corporate world.

2454241,5,B000C8STWQ,"Shadows in the Sun is a touching movie about a young editor, Jeremy (played by Joshua Jackson), who is told to convince an older author, Weldon Parish (played by Harvey Keitel), to write another book to be published by the company Jeremy works for.  Weldon has not written a book for twenty years.  He stopped writing after his wife was killed in a car accident.  He is an off the wall kind of man who lives the way he wants to live not caring in the slightest what others might think.  Jeremy wants to be a writer but doesn't know what he would have to say.  He envies Weldon because the man has incredible talent. Jeremy also feels frustrated with Weldon because Weldon refuses to write.  Weldon says he doesn't write because he believes he does not have anything left to say.

The scene that I love the most in this movie is when Weldon sits before his typewriter with his fingers poised above the keys.  Tears collect in his eyes, and his emotions overwhelm him.  His fear and grief are written all over his face.

The next scene that touches my heart is the one where Weldon says to his three beautiful adult daughters, ""What?  Haven't you ever seen a writer?""  The daughters hug their father and cry because their father, whom they love dearly, has begun to write again.

The movie is funny in many places.  I love it when Weldon convinces Jeremy to steal a cow.  The movie also moves me to tears.

Weldon says something like this, ""Aren't all artists crazy?  There are many talented people out there who do not make any money.  You don't choose to be an artist.  It chooses you.""  I can relate.  I did not wake up one day and say, ""I suppose I should write novels.  Yes, that's a good idea.  I want to make pennies per hour and have a small chance of being read.""  True writers write simply to write regardless of the outcome.  Writers write because they have something to say, and this movie captures that truth in an entertaining and moving way.",1361145600,2,1954,4.421348314606742

2454247,4,B000C8STWQ,"Shadows in the Sun (2005) - is a quality, entertaining and
relaxing movie, that meets and exceeds the standard set by
Harvey Keitel over his career.

Of course, Keitel has made a number of hard-edge, tough
underworld movies, but in many of those in the mid-90's has mellowed
out, and took on less of the earlier lone-wolf, tormented and
controversial roles and more melodramatic, balanced, grown-man
roles, many of which having a European sensibility.

This is a great movie for HK, in the same manner of many of his
movies from the 90's that were also excellent. Of course, it is
not for everyone, considering the fragmented, completely scattered
tastes, opinions and inclinations of over 80% of the viewing
public, who too often, just gobble up whatever is on the front
page of a newspaper, magazine or website these days, 9 times out
of 10.

So,  I am glad to support and collect this legend's works in the business.

In this movie, the viewer has the opportunity to see a contrast
between HK, in the role of a retired writer with that of an
up-and-coming and aspiring writer; of one who has been there and done
that as a youth, and over his life. The publisher's road rep is
presneted as a teetotaler, roboticized, plasticized from the
environmental limitations and economical conditions in which he was
brought up as and his character formed with the usual outside, social
pressures.

Once in Italy, HK, reponding to a request for coaching that
aspiring professional, advises the latter to discover the ""Wild Man""
that is struggling to jump out of him, to grab onto something more
stimulating that an ordinary routine, repeated day after day, time after
time, to instead make every living moment meaningful, allowing those
experiences to later be put to paper, in a book.

The supporting actor, playing the young writer, is Joshua
Jackson, who many may jump too soon in underestimating, but
actually, is able to balance both aspects of staying true to his
own British role upbringing, and culture while at the same time, changing,
as a chameleon,  not staying impervious to the beauty of this
(fictional) Italian small town (less than 500 people) where
residents still have not only knowledge of their traditions handed
down in the past 500 to 2,000 years, but still live many of  them on a
daily basis. The church, the priest, the town folk, festivities, combined with
HK's young, charismatic woman (played by Claire Forlani), coupled with
wine and song from time to time, in a rural setting. brings a charm to the screen.

Granted, this small world is fictional, idyllic, and utopic
.. but sometimes, to change into a dream-world state, this is
what some viewers may enjoy to turn off from a hyper-technological,
hyper-accelerated pace of life.

Congratulations to Harvey Keitel in selecting a role in another
great script, and demonstrating depth time after time, in
various roles, and bringing together all  actors and cinematic professionals
to release this great movie and others.",1357948800,,2991,4.924453280318091

You might really enjoy this movie if you think Somerset Maugham is a good name for a beach cottage, that Oprah is smartly entertaining, and that things are going swimmingly well in DC where we are under strong and true leadership,  Otherwise I think you should consider watching a good movie, something like ""This Property is Condemned.""  This Property is Condemned has weak bookends but it also has two things that this film lacked; a real story and good acting.  You should especially avoid this movie if you are prone to think about the films that you have watched; the more you think about this one, the more you will dislike it.

The only problem is, there is another entirely different movie with different cast with the same title!  This is the one that is filmed in Tuscany, and stars Harvey Keitel, Joshua Jackson, and Claire Forlani, with Giancarlo Giannini.  Harvey Keitel is perfect for this part as an eccentric, famous author, Welden Parish, who has, to the dismay of his fans, stopped writing and now owns a vineyard in Tuscany, living the life of a recluse. Keitel is at his best in this role.  Joshua Jackson was charming as the young book editor, sent to Italy to convince Weldon Parish to start writing again.  With charm, charisma and good looks, Joshua Jackson  portrays his character with intelligence and integrity as well as being comedic and bumbling. He was well cast with Claire Forlani who seemed well suited for her role as Isabella, who has a romantic interest in Jeramy Taylor (Joshua Jackson).  And what can you say about Carlo Giannini? He is ALWAYS outstanding; one of the best actors ever and, as usual, contributes much to the enjoyment of the movie.  And then there's the scenery.  Ahhhh, that beautiful Italian countryside and the charming villas. I loved the story, the scenery, the music, and characters, and for those who love a feel-good movie, I highly recommend Shadows In The Sun!",1300665600,,1415,4.766393442622951
2454257,4,B000C8STWQ,"We watched this film last night and did enjoy it but we will not, however, want to watch it again anytime soon; it's not a bad film but just a little too predictable. It does have some beautiful scenery and some interesting characters but too often they're engaged in slightly over-the-top situations which compromise the films originality.

The sudden breaks are rather strange as one reviewer pointed out; it really does appear they were intended for the insertion of commercials; I've seen this effect on older TV shows but their reason was clear there.

The three main characters played by Harvey Keitel, Joshua Jackson, and Claire Forlani did good jobs with the roles they played. Brad Mirman, the writer, brought together a collection of situations which we have seen many times before and was pretty sure to attract an audience.

By way of summation, this is an entertaining film that uses predictably pleasant ingredients resulting in an evening of very familiar enjoyment. I know this is a personal opinion based on my viewing of several other films using the same ingredients; several of these films are some of my favorites and set a high standard.

The actors are perfectly cast in their individual roles and together make for a delightful experience.

Can you really ignore the calling blaming it all on fear of failure or other sircumstances in life? The story in this film touches on many simmular subjects and gets it done very well! I was amazed for a movie to cover so much in such an interesting, but healthy and useful way. Even though it starts out a bit slowly, but the scenes get better and better as we familiarize ourselves with the people of Tuscany more. With loads of easy going but great lessons and some tear jerking scenes, the movie provides amazingly beautiful and heart warming shots of Tuscany. You'll want to go to Italy, but best of all, you'll want to go to that place in your own heart that makes sense to you. This movie pushes on the hardship of discovering a way out in life for creative people. For many folks their dreams never come true, they're like little birds that cannot fly out of a cage, so in this story, what's amazing is that all the characters found their way out. Everyone had a happy ending only because they listened and they learned. I also enjoyed the story line between the young editer and the older writer. Heartbreaking and very thaughtprovoking. I thought this movie was amazing, in fact it is now one of my favorites.

After Jeremy spends time in Tuscany he finds himself very much in love for Weldon's daughter (Claire Forlani) and also he becomes friends with Weldon.  This movie has a little bit of everything...romance, comedy, and wonderful scenes of Italy.  However I would consider this a girl's movie...or better yet..""chick flick"".

Although the plot was somewhat predictable, I did not find the characters a cliche. Americans sometimes think that depicting women in patient or nurturing roles is politically incorrect.  Having just returned from an extended trip to Italy myself, I found the women to be amazingly thoughtful, sensual, and yes, full of scrap and spirit. The feminine spirit can do amzing things to nurture and tend others and I applaud this movie for daring to portray it. I found the women in this movie the true support behind the journies of the ""main"" characters.  I also enjoyed the evolving relationship between the older writer and the younger publisher. As the relationships took on meaning for both characters, their commitment to each others well fare grew. They were both passionately devoted and stuck around for the natural out-come. The final scene was somewhat predictable (we knew the girl would get the guy) and yet it seemed the only correct ending. My faith in mankind, my passion for relationships and the creative spirit were rekindled.  This movie has it all; death, excentic artists, love, romance, anger, depression, etc,,, I loved it.",1154217600,32,1268,4.938967136150235
2454272,5,B000C8STWQ,"This is a rare movie that goes beyond its superb acting, engaging plot, and beautiful setting to explore deep philosophical issues: What is creativity? What makes a writer great? Why are some people compelled to write? Why would a great writer stop writing? It is an immensely enjoyable and engaging movie. As someone who has spent parts of two recent summers in a small village in Tuscany, I was immensely impressed at how well the movie captured the spirit of one of the most magical places on earth. It is one of those rare movies that I will want to watch again and maybe again.",1153958400,17,582,4.552380952380952
2454273,1,B000C8STWQ,"Although I would normally give 'Shadows in the Sun' 5 stars because it is a wonderful film, beautifully shot with some stunning landscapes of Tuscany, I can't help but give it 1 star for the dreadful pan-and-scan (4x3) DVD presentation forced upon Region 1 viewers.  Buena Vista Distributors should be hung, strung and quartered for releasing such a dreadful presentation on the US market and at a price of $29+ it proves that some studios are just plain greedy and hold their customers in contempt.  Surely they could have obtained the original anamorphic master digi-tape of the movie for US release.

The  good news is that the film was shot in anamorphic widescreen, (1.78:1 - enhanced to 16x9).  The bad news is that the NTSC version is pan-and-scan, presumably re-edited for TV.  They have 'forced commercial breaks' into the film, that's why there are so many 'fades to black' where the storyline does not justify them.  Before the end titles scroll up, the picture and vocal song fades to black, and a pan up to the sky and part of the vocal are lost.

Well, if you want to see the film in all its glorious anamorphic (16x9) widescreen presentation, with exceptional picture quality and color saturation, buy the Region 2 PAL version from amazon.co.uk.  The picture is so sharp you would think HD couldn't look any better!  The audio is somewhat superior too!  The disc also contains the same extras as the US version.  What a difference the correct screen ratio transfer can make to the complete enjoyment of a movie, in the way it was originally intended to be seen!  5 Stars for the movie - 1 star for the terrible NTSC Region 1 version!",1151884800,63,1648,4.700348432055749
2454274,1,B000C8STWQ,"Jeremy Taylor, a very corporate, conformist junior editor, is commissioned by his boss to angle a book contract out of Weldon Parish, a successful novelist who has shunned writing for over two decades, in order to heighten the prestige of the publishing house. Taylor drives to Tuscany where Parish has been leading a retreated, if hard-drinking, life with his three grown-up daughters and a few farm animals, since the death of his wife. Initially disencouraged by the author's irascibility, Taylor manages to find common ground with him and, inevitably, falls swiftly in love with Isabella, his eldest daughter. Parish starts tapping away on his typewriter again. The story - after all the goofy jokes and pseudo-poetic moments - culminates in the ultimate clichs of romantic comedy: a bird with apparently broken wings, trapped in a cage, flies free, whilst the romantic couple gallop on horses towards a setting sun, accompanied by a soaring orchestra.

The script is weak; the literary-descriptive moments which intend to create ""atmosphere"" and lend the characters emotional depth repel because of their hackneyed style; the comic moments are so predictable that they backfire like boomerangs. Writer-director Brad Mirman regurgitates the crassest US-American stereotypes of Italian people and culture and reinforces every clich about writing: all artists are crazy; the male is the creator, the female is just the muse, the commodity deployed to inspire him. The film genre - an older, wiser man delivers overly moralistic life lessons to a young apprentice and learns something from him on the way - was already oversaturated, so why did we need this corny, uninspiring addition?",1151452800,10,1687,5.318352059925093
2454275,4,B000C8STWQ,"Tuscany is like a magnet for sentimental Americans: the landscape, the people, the appreciation of life emanates from the sunscapes and offers a paradise to world-weary viewers.  And so it is that Tuscany is the true star of this little romantic film.  Yet writer/director Brad Mirman clearly knows how to script and move a story that, while predictable, still carries us along with wonderful characters from a fine cast.

Jeremy (Joshua Jackson) works for a publishing house in New York and is sent to Tuscany to coerce famous novelist Weldon Parish (Harvey Keitel) into ending his 20-year moratorium and write a new, 'bound to be best seller' novel.  Parish has not written since he lost his beloved wife, becoming instead a rascal who spends his days basking in the lazy sun with his best friends the priest Father Moretti (Giancarlo Giannini), hotelier Gustavo (Armando Pucci) and his squeeze Amalia (Valeria Cavalli).  He lives with his daughter Isabella (Claire Forlani) and is visited often by his other daughters Dinnie (Silvia De Santis) and  Maura (Bianca Guaccero), each of whom hopes that their father will return to writing. Upon Jeremy's arrival he finds that everyone in the village is protective of Parish and when he finally meets the silent author, he discovers a man who loathes editors, publishers, press, and anyone else who wants him to start writing again.  Gradually Jeremy and Parish begin to break down barriers: Jeremy admits that he longs to be a writer but fears failure and Parish admits that his silence at the typewriter is due to a similar fear.  Jeremy falls in love with Isabella, becomes a part of Parish's drinking trio, undergoes some lessons in life .... and the ending is obvious from the start!

Harvey Keitel gives a moving performance as the gritty but passionate writer, Joshua Jackson makes Jeremy a believably transitioned man, and the supporting cast is consistently excellent. It really doesn't matter that we know from the beginning just how things will turn out: it is the getting there that is the pleasure of this light but touching film. The only significant problems are in the editing: there appear to be stops and starts as though this were made for television with places for commercials.  But other than that this is a film that only asks that we relax, nod recognition, and enjoy the theme of the importance of honesty and the quality of life available if we follow our dreams.

A must watch for any movie fan who likes funny movies and romantic movies. Harvey Keitel is fabulous in this movie!!!  All of the characters are lovable - in their own way. If you pass on this one, you will miss out on a great movie memory. Young guy is sent to Italy to try and convince Harvey Keitel to write another book. Meets Harfey's daughter...romance.  Harvey is a free spirited old, cranky, funny, challenge for the young guy who is trying to get him to write another book. Lots of laugh-out-loud moments in this movie and a late blooming romance between the young guy and Harvy's daughter...how this going to turn out - you'll have to watch the movie to find out.",1526169600,,707,4.465116279069767
