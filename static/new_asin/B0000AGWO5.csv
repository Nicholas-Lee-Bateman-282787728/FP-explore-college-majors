1906127,5,B0000AGWO5,"definitely the most intense fight of YYH. not a second is wasted. and the results are extremely surprising. kurama vs. karasu is a gripping, exciting match. yoko kurama shows up again to battle, and karasu unmasks! what happens when the two powers meet up?
a little bloodshed, but an awesome fight",1066435200,5,297,4.8431372549019605
1906128,5,B0000AGWO5,"These episodes are great.  Kurama shows his true abilities by chemically releasing yoko kurama the fox spirit who hid inside the infant that grew to become the kurama we know so well.  Very elite in the supernatural realm, the king of thieves is wise and summons demonic plants to protect himself.  Unfortunately the wicked Karasu has the ability to create kamikazi bomb demons mentally and picks away at regular kurama quite a bit before the transformation occurs.  Botan shows much grief for the passing of Genkai, and Yusuke can't admit to himself that she is gone for good.  There should be three more discs in the dark tournament series, one for each of the other matches.  Bui and Hieh should be next.  THAT will be one you must have.  I don't know about any of you but Hieh is the most interesting character in the series to me.  Back when a friend would send me episodes from Japan as they aired I was always rooting for Hieh even though I had no idea what was happening.  Having seen way past this area in the series I really hope they keep putting out dvd's since it gets better and better from here.  Everything up to this point is just developing the characters for the real battles ahead.  Anyway enjoy!",1064448000,2,1216,4.527522935779817
1906129,4,B0000AGWO5,"I love Yu Yu Hakusho, and as soon as this came out I bought it!
There is ONLY ONE FLAW on this DVD though.  If you perfer to watch it in Japanese with Subtitles, they messed the subtitles up on ""Yoko's Magic"" (a.k.a. ""A Desparate Kurama: A final Measure""), so the first half of the episode has the introduction subtitle stuck at the bottom of the screen.  This is the ONLY reason why it lost a star from me.  But to be really honest, if you watch the English version, then go back and watch the Japanese, it doesn't make a lot of difference ^_^
The final round, the fight between Team Urameshi and Team Tugoro, is finally beginning, and the battle between Karasu and Kurama is the most beautiful fight in the world, so this is still definately worth buying.  Don't miss out on this great action in Yu Yu Hakusho!",1063756800,2,812,4.322368421052632
1906130,5,B0000AGWO5,"Yes! the finals are here! and good ol' Yoko Kurama makes an apperance *i think i haven't had time to watch it -_-'* Yoko Kurama made an apperance in the last battle with Yuyu-urishama *did i spell that right?* because he had a box that would turn people back into their former forms. for a human they would be turned into an infant. but for Kurama he turned into Yoko Kurama *my fav. character* Kurama was Yoko, a fox demon who could control plants. Yoko had lived for thousands of years in makai and picked up many skills including theivery. when he was stealing something that must have been fairly important because he was caught and injured badly. he escaped within an inch of his life and went to the human world where he found a pregant woman and transmitted his soul into the infant within her. Thus he was born Suiechi *did i spell that right?* and grew as a normal human boy would but as he grew his memory slowly came back. Thats all i know up until he meets Yusuke. Okay, it's the final battle with the Torguro team! Let the blood spray begin!! Ready, FIGHT!!!",1059177600,3,1071,4.386934673366834
1906131,5,B0000AGWO5,"The first episode is kind of boring. It mainly recaps what happened before, but that is fine with me, because it has been about a year since I last saw those episodes. In the 2nd episode, the fight begins. Karasu seems to have the lead. But, Kurama becomes the legendary bandit Yoko Kurama. The tables turn. Kurama is destroying Karasu's deadly bombs one by one, then unleashes a giant plant, the Ojigi. The plant nearly kills Karasu. Karasu escapes the deadly plant, and he himself becomes a huge bomb. He attacks Kurama headfirst and creates a huge explosion, killing many demon spectators. Yoko Kurama becomes Suichi Minamono once again (Kurama in human form). Kurama is takes many hits and at one point nearly his whole body was soaked in his own blood. Then he unleashes a giant plant using his life energy.
I'm not going to tell you what happens, I have probably spoiled enough already.",1078963200,2,892,4.7243589743589745
1906132,5,B0000AGWO5,This is the best series of Anime in my opinion.  This DVD which features the epic battle between Kurama and Karasu has one of the most suprising outcomes imaginable.  It features several extras along with the great story.  The animation is great and the voices aren't bad either.  I would highly recommend this DVD if you enjoy anime.,1075766400,,334,4.706896551724138
1906133,5,B0000AGWO5,"If you are a fan of the beautiful, graceful, articulate, foxy Kurama (as you can tell, I am) then this DVD will easily become your favorite volume out of the whole series.
If you aren't a Kurama fan, but still enjoy Yu Yu Hakusho, you will STILL love this DVD.  Kurama Vs. Karasu is non-stop action which will have you on the edge of your seat, gripping the armrests until your fingers become stiff and red.
On a more general note, I have to say that the Yu Yu Hakusho dub is great.  It's a rareity to come across a good dub, but occasionly you WILL find one.  This is one of those rareitys. (as is Cowboy Bebop and a select few others) I love how the voices match the character's personailites and they never become monotone like a lot of dub voices.
This DVD definietely deserves a 5 star rating for all it's action, suspense, and good dialouge to boot. ^^",1075334400,2,858,4.283950617283951
1906134,5,B0000AGWO5,"This was the best, I loved it out of all the dvd's, yoko kurama vs. karasu, it made you sit on the edge of your seat!! it was inspiring!! if your a kurama fan, then get this dvd, you will see his true form, his voice is much different, and looks like a fox...",1072742400,,259,3.814814814814815
1906135,5,B0000AGWO5,"I read a review where one fan bought the uncut copy of Yoko Kurama, and noticed that the cover on the actual disk shows the edited volume's picture of Kurama.  I would like to say, do not despair!  That is the actual uncut disk!  It just has a different picture, but it is the uncut volume!  The disks used the regular covers beginning with the next volume, Sword and Dragon, while the edited volumes probably still have the picture of a character on them.  Well, hopefully this will put your fear to rest, so that way you can now go and watch this excellent DVD!",1067904000,5,563,4.3238095238095235
1906136,3,B0000AGWO5,"Did anyone else who opened their uncut dvd case get a dvd disc with a picture of Kurama (that matches the picture on the edited dvd case) on it?  I suspect that this is the edited dvd disc erroneously inserted inside the dvd case for the uncut (unedited) version.  Did anyone get the usual blue dvd disc with the word uncut on it?  If you did get the blue disc will you please post what distribution center it came from?  The disc that I suspect is actually the edited version inside the uncut (unedited) dvd case came from the Kentucky distribution center.  From one Yu Yu Hakusho fan to another, I just want to get the item I ordered and paid for, so please post any information that will help.  Thanks!!",1067126400,,706,4.351145038167939
7997198,5,B0000AGWO5,"Yusuke Urameshi is a high school delinquent. He doesn't go to class, and he's always getting in fights. One day he is trying to save a boy that is about to be hit by a car, he is killed instead. He is approached by a pretty girl flying on a broom. Her name is Botan, and she's the Grimm Reaper. She offers him a chance to regain his life. After coming back to life Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective. He gain spiritual powers and hunts down rogue apparitions that cause trouble for the living world. He is joined by his friend Kuwabara, the demons Hiei and Kurama. Together they fight off the deadly demons that seek to destroy the world.

After the death of Genkai, the finals begin. Kurama fights against the evil Karasu. Karasu is more than Kurama can handle, but an attack goes totally wrong. Kurama turns back into his demon form. A creature that was one of the most feared in all the demon world. Karasu may not be able to stop our transformed hero.

This is  a great series. It has lots of cool characters, good animation, voice acting, and a very engrossing story. It's a very long anime, so if you want to watch it be prepared to like it and spend a long time with it. It's one of those that gets more interesting as it progresses. Even though it has a bang up start it maintains the flow throughout. I would even go so far as to say that it's one of the most famous anime series' of all time. It has a bit of a Dragonball Z vibe to it, and everyone likes that. I highly recommend Yu Yu Hakusho to every anime fan, it's simply amazing.",1353110400,,1543,4.223728813559322
7997199,5,B0000AGWO5,This is the wierdest anime I've ever seen. Freaky battles and a lot of psychological tricks. Weird to watch. It's enjoyable but not like Rurouni Kenshin. The fights in Yu Yu Yakusho are kinda fascinating and psychological. Razor sharp rose petals so a flower can be a deadly weapon.,1298764800,,282,4.775510204081633
7997200,5,B0000AGWO5,"I am a big Kurama fangirl, and this dvd is definetly for those who are a fan of the red-headed plant master or his sly kitsune side. This dvd contains both parts of the Kurama vs. Karasu battle, and lemme tell you- wow. Karasu's mind games, Kurama's plants, Yoko coming out for a chance at Karasu, bombs, and lotsa blood. Definetly for us action-addicted YYH fans. Dvd contains 3 episodes, but they don't tell you the result of the battle- they leave that for the next dvd. Although the result is quite a shocker... but I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen it yet. You won't be disappointed!",1110585600,,597,4.4363636363636365
7997201,5,B0000AGWO5,"When I first saw this, I had it on a poorly subtitled version that cut down entire fights into a 5-minute, overall view of the violence and outcome. Even with this terrible version, I loved it! I may not be a Kurama fangirl (I'm not a girl in fact) but I got to say, Kurama kicks butt in this.
Karasu seems to be the worst of the enemies we've seen so far. He uses some sort of energy bomb to blow up what ever he touches. As the fight goes on, he releases some sort of Bat-bomb Traps that eventually hook onto Kurama and blow his leg open (Note: I was also watching the uneditted version so I saw his bone sticking out). If you're a Kurama Fangirl, you might like him as Yoko Kurama but the fight deteriorates into him transforming back and having his body blown up from every which way, leaving him bloody and tired, not the way I'm guessing you like him. But in the end, he uses a seed of the Death Plant to suck what I'm guessing is Karasu's blood out of his chest.
Overall: Good, bloody, and a Kurama Fangirls' best dream and worst nightmare! Five Stars!!",1083196800,5,1060,4.200980392156863
7997202,5,B0000AGWO5,"ok shojo, this is the best DVD  ever. All  the kurama fans who  think kurama is the most uber-sexy  guy alive will  drool over this dvd. it does have the sadistic weirdo karasu  but hey, two  bishonen for the price of one! if you  also like kurama you should get some of the CDs of the songs like Sayonara bye bye. or Hoemi no Bakudan. ^^ have fun! buy  the DVD kurama fans!",1082246400,,374,4.013698630136986

GOD I LOVE Kurama!!!  He's so cool.  This DVD ranges between down right halrious to griping and edge of your seat action.  I wasntgonna watch this till i saw the 5 DVDs before it, but I just couldn't wait!  It's worth it though!",1080345600,3,363,4.217391304347826
