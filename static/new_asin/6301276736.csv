326622,5,6301276736,One of the best vietnam war movies ever!!  Unique in seeing a perspective from the other countries side.,1234483200,2,104,4.777777777777778
326623,5,6301276736,"History repeats until we learn that firepower without a cause, represented by Beau Bridges, cannot define a cause. If Socrates was right, then Plato's firepower as prime mover fails as hyper-idealogy of a neocon i.e. ""Trotsky Strauss Philbyite Schlesinger Guy Bannister's police-military keynesian cold war liberal"" intervention, to define a cause. Firepower without a cause includes black propaganda, which as lies are only more naked firepower, for example LBJ's Tonkin lie or Iraq WMD/911 lies.

The movie does hold out a hope that we will see each other through the fog of gameboy gunboy advertising for firepower as its own cause as neo-Platonic prime mover and a case of might-makes-right, which is also firepower without a cause defined as a cause by neo-Darwinism. Seeing each other requires de-familiarizing blinding propaganda stereotypes.

In the 1950's Ed Lansdale, CIA, injected the unelectable Ngo Dinh Diem as unelected premier, replacing electable Dr. Ton Hoan and raping the political spectrum by Diem-Nhu oligarchy's fascism, removing every demographic pillar of a non-Stalinist and non-fascist SVN, so that SVN would **need** firepower. Since firepower as neo-platonic prime mover and darwin's might-makes-right zeroaster moloch baptizer never actually defines a cause other than war profits, firepower extends that opportunity indefinitely. When Agent O was about to upstage Jackie O with liabilities for AO, lock in profits by leaving.

Haing Ngor died where? In the most dangerous place in the world, when a cloud of little ice people fell and make a big pile. Thank you, Haing, for seeing us little snowflakes who killed you by piling on as a team. Oops. We have his movies though. We could see Iraqis and Palestinians and Iranians and talk to them. Vietnam, heard of it? They won as we greatly feared, but we are not harmed thereby, are we? Fear makes a little platonic ice crystal prime mover for greed-heads to pile on those with causes. A pile of dry snowflakes has to melt a little to make an igloo, because police-military keynesianism is not utopia.",1232755200,4,2079,5.2
326624,3,6301276736,"I give this uber low-budget Vietnam movie a salute for showing the Enemy side of the conflict through an objective lens.  I've watched alot of Vietnam movies, most of which suffer from low-budget historical inaccuracies in weapons, uniforms, vehicles: mainly because its no longer possible to acquire all US-Vietnam era gear from renting third world armories, like in the Philipines.  This movie has those flaws but  most war movies w/out big budgets from the 80's did, so bear that in mind.

The intro shows the main character, Han, a Viet Cong, snipe down to 2 Americans in the triple canopy forest: they all look like just kids...Beau Bridges plays an American officer who eventually falls into the hands of the Viet Cong. Han is forced to take him on a forced march back to his communist superiors; away from a meglomaniac ambitious comrade who is angerly pursuing.  Clearly shows the Viet Cong's use of terrorism as Han assignments involve assignation and hit squads against their more vulnerable enemies. The final confrontation involves a large battle.

Despite some melodramitic moments, this movie definetly made me think about the opposing force's view of the Vietnam War and read the Sorrow of War, by Dith Pran: the most sobering book I have ever read, about Vietnam or any other conflict.",1115078400,7,1301,4.972350230414746
326625,5,6301276736,"While obviously not a high budget film, this one delivers with great battle scenes and an awesome story.  Definitely needs to be on DVD and i'm very surprised it's not.  The film artfully cuts through scenes from both the VC and American points of view and although cheesy and a bit stereotypical in it's representation of the Viet Cong, I have yet to see a Vietnam film that does justice to them and attempts to protray them as honestly this one does. I loved this movie, the final battle scene is so wicked. It's not one of those gung ho, totally unbelivable movies where the hero kill 100 enemy and still lives. This film is gripping and you will be glued to your seat as events slowly unfold.  I only wish it was 3 hours long!  Things like this really happened in the war and the writers and directors should be commended at doing such a wonderfull job of protraying it. Get it for the sweet battle scenes if nothing else.  This film is a true gem in the rough for those really interested in the history of this war, and are tired of the same old unrealistic war movies that have been produced in Hollywood.",1107734400,16,1111,4.37378640776699
326626,3,6301276736,The Iron Triangle kept me watching. Their were storylines and characters that I wish were expanded on like the relationship with Ho(played by Liam Whatley) and his girlfriend. Their was a beautifull final battle scene where the sound became operatic in a religious sort of way. It reall made the battle scenes more poignant. I thought those scenes were very well filmed and special effects great. The scene where Ho's Girlfriend gets spotted in the chaos of battle by the arch enemy captain of the South Viet. Army but gets his was a great scene as well as the ball crucher that every male watching would cringe too. All in all worth it.,1065052800,5,637,4.646017699115045
326627,5,6301276736,This film gives a dimension to the Vietnamese that others lack. They are real human beings! It shows they struggled with many issues as their American counterparts did.,1035417600,5,168,5.035714285714286
326628,1,6301276736,"This movie absolutely sucked. It was the worst thing i had ever seen. I do not reccommend it to anyone. I watched it in an English class because we are reading ""The Things They Carried"" by Tim O'Brien.  I don't really like war movies, but I did really enjoy ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Pearl Harbor"".  This movie however, didn't make the cut.  The stuff in there just wasn't good. I would give it no stars, but it says i have to give it a rating of 1-5 stars. so I will give it one, but just know that I didn't really want to.",1020211200,4,525,4.077669902912621
326659,4,6301276736,Pretty good DVD covering the war. Tells story from both perspective pretty realistic with good uniforms and action shots. Story is pretty good as well documenting the capture and escape of an army captain and battle at the end of movie,1396051200,,235,4.7560975609756095
326660,3,6301276736,"I bought this DVD mainly because a dear friend of mine wrote the script.  But I was not disappointed as I knew
the author was a good writer.  This story is from the point of view of the enemy side, i.e. the View Cong.  This
is something most folks would not consider until they have actually seen the movie.  I recommend the DVD
just to get an idea of how everyone thinks.  I know, in the end, you will agree, war never helps anyone except
the fools that start them.",1394928000,3,466,4.133333333333334
326661,4,6301276736,"The Iron Triangle, 1989 film

This story is set in 1960s Vietnam. It is unusual to present the viewpoints of the Viet Cong. One Viet Cong reminds the others how they defeated the Chinese centuries ago, and will do the same to the Americans today. There interpersonal conflict [as part of human nature everywhere]. The Iron Triangle referred to that part of Vietnam where the National Liberation Army was strongest. Can you get to killing men in combat? Two soldiers tell of their past and family history. Will land be distributed to the people who work the fields? Yes, in the future. Ho has been ordered to kill a woman, this troubles him. She does propaganda work.

The old man who questioned her is killed. [Why would they send one man against a house guarded by many? A test? Her boyfriend suspects something. Is it too quiet? Ho shows his talents. Please. Ho follows orders. Dead bodies are displayed to educate and warn the others. The American troops walk into an ambush, then call for help. Their Captain is captured alive. The weapons of the fallen are collected (for reuse). The captured Captain is beaten to get him to talk, then kept awake and hungry. Ho explains his reasons to Phung. [The end justifies the means is from Machiavelli and always quoted out of context.] Ho frees the Captain and takes him n a long walk to deliver him to Captain Tung.

They are fighting to get back the land they won from the French. A bridge built under water is unnoticed by aerial photography. There is news about Hos friend Phung. The Captain makes his escape and is rescued by a helicopter. The VC fires on the Americans, they are intermixed with the villagers. There are casualties on both sides. The VC retreat. Helicopters shoot at the fleeing enemy. A lone woman is shot, she has a last statement. A bazooka fires at a machine gunner. A jet drops napalm bombs in the jungle. Ho crawls away into the bush. Hold your fire! Ho does not pull the pin on his grenade. Afterwards the Captain reads Hos diary (he never saw him again).

The end credits tell about the actors and its funding. It was filmed in Sri Lanka (a former colonial country). This is a story that tries to provide a balanced portrayal of both sides without offending either. Was it educational?",1387670400,4,2261,4.589108910891089
326662,5,6301276736,The movie was good and I recommend it to any Vietnam war buffs. If you are keen to know more from the Vietnam cong point of view.,1383264000,,129,3.814814814814815

It would have been better if it had of been a cowboy show , You know what I mean, All that Bang,Bang and shoot Em up stuff! The company sent it out on time and all , You know! And the quality of the picture show was passible, But Hollywood aut to start making some good more modern shows than old no good war shows like they do now a days!

It is one of my all time favorites of the Vietnam Conflict. It is toid through the eyes of a Vietcong soldier....oit is based on a true encounter and the diarey of this young soldier.

I give the DVD 5 stars. Better get it while it lasts.",1347062400,,370,4.0
326666,5,6301276736,Very good movie from 1989 and the MGM special limited edition production is excellent.picture is clear and sound is A-1. Beu Bridges here plays the soldier (american captain) in a cat and mouse battle against the obstinate Vietcong leader when the american captain is captured and they become friends of sort. Lots of action and a definite oldie goldy to add to your war collection. 91 minutes long and in Dolby stereo and widescreen. Nothing to complain about here as this movie is one for the books. Unfortunately there is no special features but if you own this on vhs you'll be glad to get it on the dvd special pressing. Thanks MGM and keep up the great editions of old war film not yet on dvd coming in.,1337472000,2,709,4.503875968992248
326667,5,6301276736,"This movie comes full circle by showing both sides of the Vietnam War. The movie clearly shows both sides of the story and for once the Americans are not the bad guy.
An Army officer is taken prisoner by the North Vietnamese and although he is abused he develops a friendship with one of his kidnappers. The main bond forms because the American officer has a son the same age as his North Vietnamese captor. His captor  helps him escape and faces consequences as a result. IF the ending does NOT make you cry or at least think long and hard then maybe you should check your pulse. This movie is  based on a journal found of a NV soldier.",1276128000,,637,4.3
