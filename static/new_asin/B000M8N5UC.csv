8167183,5,B000M8N5UC,"His DVDs can be pricey but you learn and learn and learn.  You can't go wrong with Dr. McDougall's diet.
I have seen every single one of his lectures online.  He is 100% on target as to what is wrong with the way modern society eats.  I also recommend his book, ""The starch Solution"" for those diet fanatics who are terrified of starches.
As for a meat-eating diet, we should be ashamed of ourselves for all of the factory killing of animals.  With the escalation of heart diseases, and a host of other diseases cutting short our lives, it seems as though the animals are getting the last laugh on us.",1392595200,,601,4.387387387387387

8167186,5,B000M8N5UC,"I first heard about Dr. McDougall in the mid-eighties.  I bought his book, ""The McDougall Plan"" and followed it carefully and began an exercise program.  I lost 50 pounds in six months and was the healthiest and strongest that I had ever been in my life.
Now, many years later, my wife developed diabetes and was plagued with infections and abcesses.
It is fortunate that Dr. McDougall is still around and even has foods that you can buy through Amazon.com.
My wife has lost weight and is no longer suffering from infections.  She is sold on the McDougall approach.
Dr. McDougall has a way of explaining how nutrition affects health that is easy to understand for both the layman and medical professionals.  He has a website with lots of current information about health and diet.
He is the best.",1281916800,14,796,4.705035971223022

8167188,5,B000M8N5UC,"Although this video series was produced in 2003, the information in it remains accurate and useful.  I have been to Dr. McDougall's 10-day program and the presentations in this video are very similar to some of the information I received in Santa Rosa.  It was worth purchasing for the variations and additional information.  I particularly appreciated the presentation about dairy foods.",1272240000,19,388,5.327868852459017
