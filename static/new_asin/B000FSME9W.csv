2583841,1,B000FSME9W,"This is a tired retread of the first in the series. But unlike the first movie, you actually keep hoping the killer will start knocking these obnoxiously bad actors off, and the sooner the better. It took almost all of the movie to get to that, and in the meantime you have to suffer through the agony of one of them trying to be a rock star. I guess the producers had to fill up the movie with SOMEthing and it obviously wasn't going to be good quality dialogue. They seem to think teens are bubble headed idiots who would love to see the ""glamorous"" idea of rock concert. Booooring.

2583843,3,B000FSME9W,"Released in 2006, Ill Always Know What You Did Last Summer is about a teen prank gone wrong in a Colorado ski resort town. The youths swear themselves to silence, but problems mount the next summer when it becomes clear that someone knows their secret. Then the bodies start piling up. The teens are played by Brooke Nevin, David Paetkau, Torrey DeVitto, Ben Easter and Seth Packard while Michael Flynn and K.C. Clyde play the sheriff and deputy.

This third installment in the series was straight-to-video and therefore lacks the polish of the first two movies. Youll particularly notice this with the weak pacing and the lesser acting talents of the youthful cast. Despite these flaws, its a worthwhile addition to the series because, like the first sequel, they completely switch the location, this time to a ski resort in the mountains of Colorado (albeit shot in Utah). I cant think of any other film that takes place in this environment so it makes it stand out.

I also like how one of the teens, Zoe, plays in a grunge rock band and quite a bit of the runtime involves her bands practice pad in a barn or them playing out. Nevin is also a plus; she makes for a strong heroine and has a striking face. I further appreciate how the writers actually tied this film to the previous two, which you wouldnt think theyd be able to do since its an entirely different cast of characters in a completely different environment, not to mention it being almost ten years after the first movie.

The film runs 92 minutes.

2583865,5,B000FSME9W,"I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer (2006) Straight-to-Video. Running Time: One Hour, 32 mins.
Directed by Sylvain White. Written by Lois Duncan, Michael D. Weiss.
This is the third movie in the series and the last until 2016.

It is summer in Broken Ridge, Colorado. Some friends are on a date together enjoying the carnival. Colby (David Paetkau) tells them about the Fisherman who sharpens his hook every July 4 and kills teenagers. Lance (Ben Easter), working as a carnival worker, tells Colby that in this town, in the summer, even a psycho killer knows to avoid this place.  P.J. Davis (Clayton Taylor) skateboards in. The men discuss their college plans while P.J. has decided to enroll in the R.O.T.C.
  Suddenly, a shadow rips open a red tarp wall by Lance's booth. It is the Fisherman with a hook. He swipes at Colby's arm. Colby tells everyone to run. Now the Fisherman goes after P.J. who is on a roof. P.J. falls.
  As it turns out, this was all a joke set up between Colby and Roger (Seth Packard). Roger was dressed as the Fisherman. When they go to check on P.J., they find him dead. He has been empelled. Someone removed the mattresses.  He really is dead and his father, Sheriff Davis (Michael Flynn) is not happy about it.
  Colby, Amber (Brooke Nevin), Zoe (Torrey DeVito) and Roger go into the woods and decide not to reveal this joke. They burn the tote bag with the costume, fake hook and fake blood on the campfire.
  Now, it is one year later. Amber returns to Broken Ridge only to find Colby has returned as well from California. He says his internship didn't work out. He implies she should move on. She tells him California was his idea. Broken-hearted, she has a bad dream about P.J.. He has a bloody shirt and he is alive.
She wakes up and decides to walk into the kitchen. The Bose turns on and scares her. On her cell phone are 50 messages. They all say ""I know what you did last summer"".
  The killer Fisherman is supernatural and powerful. He can show up anywhere.

Also in the cast: Britt Leary, Star LaPoint, Junior Richard, Levy Whitlock, K.C. Clyde.

Don Shanks plays ""The Fisherman"" and is stunt coordinator. You might remember him in The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams (1974) movie and tv series (1977-78) as ""Nakoma"".&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-5-The-Revenge-of-Michael-Myers-DiviMax-Edition/dp/B000FA57US/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers (DiviMax Edition)</a>&nbsp;(1989).

2583888,3,B000FSME9W,"I don't watch a lot of slasher flicks but I think I Know What You Did Last Summer is one of the better ones. The sequel was OK, and I hadn't yet seen the third, and I know as they overdo sequels just for the purpose of bringing in cash, they go down in quality. But I found this 3-pack for a good price, so I thought, why not get all three?

But here's the thing: I recently picked up the novel by Lois Duncan, and I was amazed by the differences between the book and the movie. I really don't think they kept anything the same, except the title, the premise, and the characters' names! How did they get away with it? Wasn't Lois Duncan furious? Why didn't they just use the premise and make their own movie out of that? It's not like people don't use similar ideas all the time. I really liked the book. It was a thriller. It had nothing to do with a guy with a hook. And get this: no one even died! The bad guy tried, but didn't succeed.

Anyway, like I said, I like I Know What You Did Last Summer. It had good suspense as they tried to figure out what was really going on. And the sequel was OK. But the third was totally pointless. It was just the exact same plot as the first movie. It especially annoyed me that the 4 teenagers (exactly like in the first movie) argued with each other about going to the police and made the pact to keep the secret forever. If they were so familiar with the original story, they should have known that would come back to haunt them! And, the thing I hate most is that (no spoiler here as this happens in all slasher flicks) so many innocent bystanders get slashed while the main characters keep escaping. A slasher on a rampage never seems to have a motive. (I have very few slasher flicks in my collection.) So for this third movie, the 3-pack gets 3 stars as a whole.",1346889600,,1809,4.136363636363637
2583889,2,B000FSME9W,They should have stopped after the first movie!  It's the same thing over and over again.  The same preditable plot....................boring,1343260800,,141,6.0
2583890,3,B000FSME9W,"For a direct to video sequel, I'll Always Know really isn't that bad. Its just really been done before.

  Once again a group of 20 somethings pretending to be 18 do something terrible and decide to bury the truth but, low and behold, someone knows what they've done and decides to get revenge. This time around, the ""teens"" stage a prank in order for one of their number to show off his mad skateboarding skills. Too bad that gravity always wins and the Moron-On-Wheels winds falling to his death. His friends decide to get rid of the evidence and think they're in the clear.  But with this being a slasher flick, we know that they are far from it.

  Fast forward one year later and pretty soon the friends begin receiving ominous texts telling them that the sender ""knows what they did last summer"" and, sure enough, one of them winds up dead. Now, the surviving pals know their goose is cooked so what do they do? They go to a rock concert where the blood bath continues until it all comes down to our plucky heroine and her pretty boyfriend to put a stop to the slicker wearing, hook wielding vigilante.

  Its not bad if you're not investing a lot of time thinking about what's really going on. The characters are all one dimensional and are the typical horror movie fodder. Like Urban Legend: Bloody Mary, the producers decided to try and take this chapter in another direction by making it more like a ghost story. It just doesn't work. Also, it would appear that if ANYONE knew the truth, they were worthy enough to find themselves on the business end of the killer's hook. Oddly enough though I liked that it moved slower than the last disaster I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. It sort of reminded me of the way the horror movies of the 80s moved like My Bloody Valentine or The Prowler. But being that its no where near as good as those classics, I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer isn't a complete waste. Definitely worth at least a rental for an afternoon waster.",1333152000,,1989,4.454545454545454

But if you enjoyed the earlier installments of this series, you will enjoy this one as well!",1332720000,,353,3.7837837837837838
2583892,1,B000FSME9W,"It's not that the original ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Know-What-You-Did-Last-Summer/dp/6305017115/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Know What You Did Last Summer</a>"" (or its sequel, for that matter) was all that good or even original, but one would think that with seven years in between films that time would have produced a sequel that was at least decent, watchable or even passable.

Nope, not even close.

""I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer,"" the third entry in the franchise with overly-long titles, isn't so much of a sequel as it is a virtual remake of the 1997 film starring Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. In this version, a group of friends play a July 4th prank that ends in tragedy. Vowing to keep it a secret between them, the cardboard cut-out characters find (unsurprisingly) that someone knows what they did and for reasons unknown, a killer in fisherman's gear is stalking them on their own turf in Colorado -- a state which, as we all know, is known for its fishing and is surrounded by an ocean, right?

Well, pretty much everything you'd expect from a direct-to-video sequel is delivered in ""I'll Always Know That This Title is too Long to Type."" From the bad acting from the no name stars to the over-stylized yet ineffective MTV-style directing, all the bases are covered. Now, granted, if you are still -- for lack of a better term -- hooked on the late '90s slasher boom, this might be a movie worth watching if only to partake in a bit of nostalgia. Having said that, though, the film delivers absolutely nothing new (save for its ridiculous twist), is lacking suspense, and there isn't a single character worth rooting for. In short, it's as bad as it looks and nothing more.",1300492800,3,1764,4.993197278911564
2583893,2,B000FSME9W,"I remember being in High School for the first film in the franchise and Kevin Williams being so popular because of Scream and Dawson's Creek that everyone I knew went to see it in theaters, and even though I have to say that I never thought that his stuff was scary, I will say that I appreciated how self aware all of his characters are in terms of their place in things.  The second film totally failed on that and made it about boobs and carnage thriller style which I didn't hate, though I can imagine that it pushed away a lot of its core audience.  I don't think that there was ever really a need for a third film in the franchise, nor really any place for one.  The first film dealt with having guilt, that combined with the common sex and immorality equal death, with the who really knows out there theme that ends up being equal parts mystery.  This movie feigns to do so, but the killer is the same as the previous two, but this time in demon form.  As lazy as this is used to relate the films to each other is about as lazy as this film's writing is.  The original was a departure from the Movie reference of Scream to show another common bond in the american pysche, the urban legend of the killer with a hook that isn't right in the head that kills horny teenagers who don't know how to be a part of society.  The ""sin"" the teenagers commit in this film is that of a practical joke that goes wrong and ends with the death of one of their friends, and when they vowel to keep it quiet it awakens the ghost of said original killer.  The substance of this film is kinda like a practical joke, with absolutely no inner thoughts or social reflections.  I don't mean to hold the first one as high art, but it kinda is compared to this one.  I reccomend this movie about as much as I want to watch it again.  Also none of these girls are a pimple on the ass of Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Just throwing that out there.  I hope this director never works again.",1272672000,,1960,4.180851063829787
2583894,3,B000FSME9W,"I bought the I Know What You Did Last Summer trilogy for a good price and was looking foward to watching this film. I have no idea why because I can barely recall the first two entrys in this teen slasher series. I notice the synposis of the film is messed up on the triolgy version, but I do not know about the actual copies of the movie.

Anyway, the film starts off with some teens staging a prank at a local fair about the fisherman. They have a kid dress up as him and chase them around. Then one friend tragically dies when a stunt goes wrong and the teens make a pact not to tell anyone about it. The plot slowly unfolds with little twists and jolts speard out. I thought for sure it was Deputy Dan doing the killings since he showed up out of nowhere most of the time. I hated the shaky camera that always goes for a cheap jolt. Whoever invented this should be ashame for ruining so many good horror films. I know it's a small gripe but I just hate those shaky camera shots and can ruin a good film. The kills were pretty good and I enjoyed a few of them, espeically the death of the deputy towards the end. The only part I hated was the killer let one victim go, which was sloppy and didn't really make much sense. When it revealed who the killer was, I thought what the hell were they thinking? I guess they thought it was a good idea but i'm still undecided about it. The ending was cheap and pointless, it really didn't make sense and I can't imagine what te next film, if made, would be called.

Overall, besides the shaky camera, I enjoyed this film. It wasn't a classic but enjoyable and the death scenes were really well done.",1251763200,,1642,4.176656151419558
2583895,4,B000FSME9W,"I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer is actually a good horror movie. There are only really two flaws in it that caused me to give it four stars instead of five. The first reason is that it is about 45 minutes before ""The Fisherman"" kills anybody, however the same is true of the previous two movies so if it didn't bother you then it shouldn't bother you in this movie. The second (and the reason why most people seem to dislike this movie) is that fact that, although it is called ""I'll always..."" suggests that it is a continuation of the first two movies, it is about a different group of teenagers who accidently kill somebody on July 4th and Jennifer Love Hewitt is not in this movie. Yes, it's a little dissapointing as she was the main charactor in the first two, but it's no reason to hate the movie.

I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer is scary and suspenseful and is gorier than ""I Know..."" or ""I Still Know..."" and is still a really good movie, with a good twist in the end involving the fisherman (I won't give any spoilers). The movie does well in creating more suspence by having the fisherman actually attack the charactors (like he did to Barry in the origional) so that you never know when the charactors are going to get killed, which makes the movie less predictable and adds to the shock factor when the main charactors do start dying.

Five teenagers are involved in a Fourth of July prank, concerning the legend of Ben Willis, which goes horribly wrong, resulting in the death of one of them. Like in the first movie, they all band together and agree to take the secret to their graves. Little do they know how literal their promises are as one year later, as Fourth of July approaches, they are killed one-by-one by a mysterious fisherman knows what they did. Yes, it is similar to the origional but not as similar as it sounds and apart from the basic plot, is completely different - but not in a bad way.

Unless you are a MASSIVE fan of Jennifer Love Hewitt and only watched the movies because she was in them, I would deffinatly reccomend this movie is worth watching. Hopefully it is not the end of the series and they may make a fourth pairing up the survivor(s) of this movie with the survivors of I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.",1237420800,4,2279,4.395734597156398

2583898,4,B000FSME9W,"Well, I loved the movies. It was great, and had a Scream/Urban Legend feel to it (that being essentially what it is). So, if you liked those film, go for this. Continuing the review...

First movie was great, a bunch of nice twists, and a feeling like this could actually happen, not a Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street rip-off at all. The killer is a living, breathing man who wants revenge for these kids hitting him with their car and leaving him for dead. Some pretty good death scenes. Featured some great actors: Jennifer Love Hewitt, scream queen Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Freddie Prinze, Jr.

Second movie: Hey, you just can't expect a sequel that's better than the first film. Once again, a feeling of realism in this movie, and there are some good kills. Once again stars Jennifer and Freddie.

Third movie: Pssh, this sucked. Essentially the first movie remade with a sequel's title. Yeah, NOW the Fisherman's a supernatural killing machine that can't be stopped. Okay kills, but this was just a movie that should never have seen the light of day.

Collection: Fairly good. No commentary, but all trailers are included. There may have been a 'Making of' for the third film, not sure. The first two discs have blank sides, one for widescreen and the other for full. The third has a cover, and is in wide-screen. So, if you're a horror buff like me, get it. If you have the first one or two, I wouldn't get it. But if you saw it in theatres, or never saw it before, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. I got mine at Wal Mart for 20-so bucks. Worth it for three films.",1221955200,2,1606,4.527586206896552

2583910,2,B000FSME9W,"Since about 2005 direct to video sequels have started to take off; while there is still a fan base for these movies it's not as strong as it once was so the DTV route is probably the best way to go. A lot has changed since the first 2 movies in the series and odds are a theatrical run would have been a flop. I'll Always Know was clearly produced on a lower budget than the previous 2, but that's not what hurt the movie.

I'll be honest I was never really a fan of this series, but I can tolerate the first one, but the 2nd was pretty much a big waste of time. The original was written by Kevin Williamson who at the time was red hot and with the success of Scream the teen slasher film made a nice comeback for a short while. I Know What You Did Last Summer was one of the better ones from that era, which isn't saying much since it was about average at best.

In many ways I'll Always Know is almost a remake of the original; if not for a very brief history on the previous 2 films this one bares no connection at all. The screenplay by Michael D. Weiss is nothing more than a rewrite of the original. It's almost the same exact movie; the characters are a like and portions of the plot are reused here. The script really isn't so bad, but not all that great either. Again it just takes the first movie and does a rewrite.

Director Sylvain White mostly works well with the limited budget he's given, but the suspense and tension is very much lacking through out. There are far too many clichs and sometimes that help a movie, if you play up to them it can make it fun, but this is a straight up slasher and the clichs bring it down. It's slasher movie 101. Sylvain White never really attempts at putting his own spin on things and does it by the book and pretty much copies the original film.

The biggest problem here is the lack of action; the first death in the movie results from a prank gone wrong, than after that 1 person who was involved gets killed. That death also comes in the first 70-minutes, which means the rest of the murder scenes come in during the final 20-minutes. Had there been some suspense and tension it wouldn't be a big deal at all, but with all that lacking it can get boring and again it's almost a remake of the original film and while the original film made for a decent suspense flick, this one however doesn't and is often just too slow paced.

One of the biggest faults of the movie is the terrible editing. I'll Always Know suffers from the quick cuts so many horror flicks use and quite honestly it almost never works and here it kills any possible tension, not that there was much to begin with, but any possible tension is ruined by the terrible quick cuts.

The cast for mostly unknowns don't do such a bad job; the acting is anything amazing, but it's not too bad. I actually quite liked Brooke Nevin as Amber. She was pretty much the Jennifer Love Hewitt character. Don Shanks best known for his role as Michael Myers in Halloween 5 steps into the role of the Fisherman and is very much under-used and the twist involving the character is quite idiotic.

If you're a fan of the series or at least the original I'll Always Know is worth a shot. For the rest of us this movie is better off being skipped. It serves as a decent time killer, but the end result is a slightly below average movie. I didn't hate the movie, but sure didn't like it and I'm in no rush to see it again. For fans only.",1210550400,2,3437,4.198484848484848

2583915,4,B000FSME9W,"First off, I LOVED the first two ""I Know"" movies. The first one, especially, had such beautiful atmosphere and cinematography and colors and it was just...awesome. Having grown up in the 80s, I was excited to see a new slasher. Scream was always too ""uppity"", but ""I Know"" was well done, while not taking itself too seriously. I like part two, also, though not as much. It was great seeing the characters evolve. When I heard they were making a part 3 - and that it was going to be DTV - I was VERY hesitant. So, I went into this movie with very low expectations.

I was not disappointed. Yeah, it starts off as a regurgitation of the original but, by the end, I was - forgive the pun - hooked. I rented it, at first, just to be safe but, after watching it, I immediately went out and bought a copy for myself. I thought the characters were believable (if not always the acting) and I thought the direction was decent (though the flash cuts got a bit annoying).

I'd toyed with my own ideas of how I would continue the series and, I was stunned to see that the makers of this film had actually shared my idea! I was VERY happy with who the killer was and now I'm really hoping they make a part 4.",1185148800,11,1196,4.195652173913044
2583916,3,B000FSME9W,"The only reason I bought this one was because it was dirt cheap.  The 2nd one was already downright aweful, so my expectations for this one weren't exactly high.  Basically part 2 & 3 are both suffering from what I like to call the Hollywood syndrome, namely that all the sequals are just bad to terrible.

This one is kept very close in almost all aspect to the original one, which was needless to say excellent and by far the best one of the movie.  Here on the 3rd attempt of the original story, the urban legend, we have again 4 teenagers that are friends, 2 boys & 2 girls.  Again they do something stupid on the 4th of July, and of course they make a promise to never talk to anyone about it, and again one year later they are not only no longer talking to each other, but are quickely forced to do so when the ever famous ""I know what you did last summer"" message come to one of them.  And again they tend to quarrel more among each other thereafter instead of making efforts to stop the Killer.

Of course, all of this gives it more than just a deja vu feeling, and dosen't exactly make it anymore unpredictable either.  But even so, this isen't the reason why I didn't think it was really good, its simply the terrible end, that ruins it for me.  Here we find out that the killer is not even human and, thus has supernatural powers.  I guess, the makers couldn't find anyone who would be believable to be the Killer.  Already making the Killer the father of the original killer in the 2nd Part was not only rediculous, but had so many plot holes in it, that you could drive trucks through them.  With this type of an end, the Killer being supernatural, the makers also ruined the story line.  I mean if this time the Killer is supernatural, what the heck, does that mean for the story?  That it dosen't matter who the killer really is, since he might as well be supernatural, and come out of thin air? This just isen't at all convincing.

Nonetheless, I must say that this DVD has its moments, during those I found myself repeadly asking who could be the killer, who has a motive, and there were serval people who could have been the psychopath.  As already stated it was the disappointing and lame ending, that not only refused to make much sense, but also ruined discovering a sensible answer to that question of who the killer was.

Anyways, if you're looking for a great Horror-Thriller don't bother, because you will most likely be disappointed with this one, but if you want a decent, somewhat suspensful, movie this one is at least good enough to do the job, save that unfortunate ending.",1181433600,,2604,4.391666666666667

What really turned me off was the setting of the carnival which I've seen dozens of times before, and the whole thing with the prank gone wrong, which I didn't buy.

2583931,2,B000FSME9W,"THIS REVIEW DOES HAVE SPOILERS SO BE WARNED!

I personally don't mind a brand new cast of characters but what I did find disappointing is that this film was almost a mirror reflection of the first film with its formula. They are all a close group of friends and through tragedy they go their separate ways keeping an awful secret until boom, a year later, one of them gets a cell phone text message ""i know what you did last summer""...blah blah blah. Okay, here's the problem. It would have been fine and dandy if the killer turned out to be a real human being that wanted revenge but instead, the killer turns out to be some supernatural zombie creature. What isn't explained is how this creature came to exist and why it suddenly decides to resurface with this group of teens? At least Freddy Kruger resurfaced on Elm Street where he has a connection and Jason is connected to Crystal Lake, but for what I can only presume to be the corpse of Ben Willis, what the heck is he doing in this town? It would have made sense if they had the group of kids fool around Ben's grave and perform some sort of voodoo ritual or something along that line, but its a mystery. And I doubt it was an intentional mystery. Its just sloppy writing. Another thing I want to point out is that the death and scare scenes were predictable. The slashing of 'what's his face's' foot at the swimming pool was similar to Ryan Phillipe's encounter at the gym in the first film. The death scene at the concert of the rocker chick is similar to Helen's (sarah michelle gellar) death in the first film. I knew who was going to survive and who wouldn't. As with the first two films, the ending also leaves us hanging. Overall, the actors did a decent job and their characters are all likeable for the most part but the storyline needed serious work.",1168041600,4,1819,4.413690476190476
2583932,1,B000FSME9W,"In Hollywood you always have to make three movies: one commercial hit and two sequels. If you're lucky, you can make more than three, but three is the required number for anyone working for Hollywood film companies. And if you're not George Lucas, Gore Verbinski, Wes Craven, or Sam Raimi, don't worry, there is something called direct-to-video film. Remember films like `Wild Things' `The Skulls' `Mimic' and `Cruel Intentions'? See? Three is the word.

But I never thought this would happen to `I Know What You Did Last Summer.' For all their popularity, I don't think `I Know What You Did Last Summer' is a great film, and I firmly believe that the only reason to watch its terrible sequel is the star Jennifer Love Hewitt. Now they made another sequel without Jennifer Love Hewitt, which means exactly no star. I would be happy to give a Zero Star if Amazon provided a rating button for that.

The Fisherman, the killer with a deadly hook comes back, it is true, but the place is Colorado ski community (I don't know why). Several teenagers in a quiet town, who thought of some plans to have fun during summer because they almost died of boredom, really start to get killed one year later after their plans ended up with a big trouble. The initial 10 minutes that describe their misguided idea of killing time and its horrible results are marginally interesting, keeping the movie from sinking deep into boredom.

The rest of the story is about the unexciting scenes of the teenagers intimidated by messages and shadows moving across before the camera, and the cat-and-mouse chase between them and the killer. There is no brooding atmosphere implying the danger lurking behind the door. There are killings, but all of them are presented with flashy MTV-like quick editing. You cannot blame the actors for playing the characters of which fate we just don't care. Perhaps they didn't either.

In short, my advice is this: forget it.",1164758400,4,1934,4.798798798798799
2583933,2,B000FSME9W,"For those that don't know, I mark any plot points I'm about to give away with #s so look for those.

Here's another series I have a deep love for.  Can you call it a series if there were only two films?  Eh, details.  Who needs em?  Luckily this film took....some in mind.  Unfortunately it manipulated some of the details to match the story they unfortunately wanted to tell.

For the good, the cast actually holds up pretty well.  Not too much 'B' horror talent here like I was expecting.  No distractions in this aspect.  And yes, it's the same movie redone over again.  Lots of characters and many red herrings spread throughout the cast.

My main problem with the movie was, well the movie as well as it's resolution and let's not forget the camera work!  The movie fell apart for me right away when it was based on a loose reasoning that's given away on the back of the dvd box.  See they play a prank and one of their friends ends up dead.  How much trouble can you get into for that?  I'm guessing it's sort of like shouting ""FIRE!"" in a crowded movie theater or something.  Is there much jailtime involved in that?  Just enough to ruin the hopes and dreams of some graduating high school students I suppose.

Anyway, despite this weak to me ideal I found myself getting into the movie thanks to some willing suspension of disbelief.  I got caught up in who might be doing the murdering and chasing.  However the murdering and chasing ended up fairly weak in the film as well.  Something the other movies did was give you chills without any murdering taking place.  Such as in the first film ###when Helen woke up with her hair sliced.  Or the second film when Julie was locked in the tanning bed.  Neither character was hurt in any way but there's still a sense of fear that errupts when you realize someone can get that close to them or any other member of the cast at any time!  There's only one real occurence of such in this film when the punk girl's guitar gets damaged.###

Another thing lets talk about:  ADD camera.  You know when the camera goes back and forth or there's quick cuts so the killer is far away and then closer and closer all of a sudden.  It's happening more and more in horror films and it bugs me.  It really gets in the way of the action for me and takes away that sense of danger.  If I can't SEE how close the killer or their weapon of mass murdering really is I don't know how much to fear for the characters being chased.  I can understand using such camera work in scenes of drug use to create that sense of disorientation those scenes need.  But when you're showing me a chase, show me the friggin' chase okay?  Not quick zooms and choppy blocks of it!

And last but not least was the tonal change.  The drastic ""reimagining"" of the whole franchise.  Now this will pretty much give away the ending so SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU DON""T WANT TO KNOW THE END OKAY?  I've done my civil duty, it's your own fault after this if you continue to read the rest of this paragraph.  #####The first two films were realisic in that I could see a man going crazy and killing the people who tried to kill him.  This movie chucked that idea and made the killer something supernatural.  Think Urban Legend 3 but even worse!  Although i suppose there WAS vodoo in the second film so there are at least prior hints of the supernatural in the series.  But still, to me it's a completely uneccesary change!  What, it's no longer scary to have a REAL person be a killer anymore?#####

Even with all the faults I found in this movie, I got some entertainment out of the few moments of tense action and the mystery of trying to figure out which red herring wasn't one.  There's only a little here, but it's enough to keep you mildly interested.  I'd say people who weren't fans of the franchise would enjoy it more since this isn't as much a continuation of the series as much as it's a pretty well done bastardation of it.",1163376000,4,3940,4.347527472527473

I have read the novel and seen the first two movies in this trilogy and enjoyed all of them.  The novel and first movie were full of surprises and the second movie had some great twists.

However, this third movie was a waste of time and should not have been made.

The plot is about some teenagers who decide to play a joke by recalling the legend of the Fisherman at a local carnival.  One of them dresses up in a trench coat and flashes a hook, then performs a stunt with one of the boys riding his skateboard off the edge of a factory roof where he is supposed to land on a mattress.

However, someone moves the mattress and the poor guy ends up dead.

I had to ask myself a question at this point.  Why was this guy so stupid that he would ride a skateboard off a factory roof, just for the sake of a stupid joke?  What's wrong with staying on solid ground?

The rest of the movie was basically the same as the first movie, but very poorly acted.

The ending was fairly ridiculous too.  When I found out who the killer was, then I thought it was just plain stupid.

This ending did not tie in with the other two films at all.  Having the killer turn out to be that person was just stupid.

2583949,1,B000FSME9W,"I Know What You Did Last Summer was an edgy suspensful slasher flick and offered decent onscreen kills, gore, solid acting, and a couple of scares that truly jolted viewers. It was followed by a rather tongue-in-cheek sequel that found itself more preoccupied with the movement of Hewitt's breasts than with actual thrills and chills. That said, that sequel is a work of art when compared to the newest ""direct-to-DVD"" concoction.

New faces pull a new trick that results in a friend (or aquaintance... their grieving is so short lived) dying accidentally and the friends behind the amuck prank vowing to keep it a secret. Of course, one of them wants to get the cops involved... but she ends up giving in to the peer pressure for no real good reason. To top it off... the whole prank is stupid in the first place and is something that only dumb people would do to end their lives quicker.

Anyways... a year later, the notes start to appear and Amber (the lead) starts feeling as if she is being watched. Then her other friends start to accept that maybe they are not safe with the secret they harbor... but of course, all too late. They begin to get slaughtered one by one... but of course, after a few dull stalking scenes. This film tries to mimic the plastic sheet scare from the first one and actually fails at pulling it off. The whole sense of ""been-there-done-that"" was to prevallant.

The acting is bad. It isn't truly dreadful... it's just bad. The editing is pretty crappy as well... although some of the camera work is pretty scenic and eerie. The kills are rather gory and a couple of them are a bit far-fetched. And of course... with movies of this type there has to be the big reveal and in this film that moment is so... LAME. Who the killer turns out to be just doesn't fit with the rest of the film... although I suppose to somefaint degree, it ties this movie to the other two. I was mildly entertained by the movie until the end happened... and then I was just blown away in dumbstruck confusion... wondering who wrote this pile of stew...

2583950,5,B000FSME9W,"Forget the ""big name"" stars from the first one -- this is the best one of the series. The difference is the writing and the plot twists. Instead of being just another typical slasher movie, this one actually develops characters you can care about, and the situations are creative and fun. The way that the teens deal with each other as they try to keep their secret rounds out the story and keeps you guessing. You've got broken-up ex's, an alcoholic...in short, more realism to go with the surprises. And, the hook man is actually more interesting here, too -- I won't give it away, but they even developed that character better, too.

Also, this is pretty well-made for a direct-to-DVD movie, I would guess they actually planned a theatrical release but maybe for some reason didn't go with it, because it's pretty slick, the acting is good, and the direction and editing are all top studio quality, so kudos to the team on that.

The second film was pretty good.  Jennifer Esposito & JLH made it above average.  Even though Jack Black was nerve shattering.

However, this film, I wasn't so crazy about.

There is no Jeniffer Love Hewitt.  But we knew that.  Not even Freddie Prinze Jr.

The movie was a lot like the original, just not as good, and it seemed to drag overall.

No t&a.  Bummer.  At least JLH flashed some great cleavage.

I didn't really care for that.

2583952,2,B000FSME9W,"""I know What You Did Last Summer"" was, by and large, a fairly decent slasher film. It was left open, wide open, for a thoroughly unnecessary and unentertaining sequel.

Now, Mandalay Pictures has seen fit to bestow upon us yet another entry into this tired little series. This one, ""I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer,"" initially caught me by some rather unexpected surprise. It was actually, hands down, better than the first two films that preceeded it. The production value was acceptable, and the refreshingly non-star cast did the screenplay some very major favors. You don't need a top-name cast for this sort of film, anyway. It does nothing but distract.

While I can't say I was altogether thrilled over what writer Michael Weiss has done with the Fisherman character, I do give him some measure of credit for assembling an otherwise moderate story.

I have two gripes, however, that I feel need to be addressed. First of all, why does each and every killer in slasher films these days have to be a complete and total carbon-copy of Jason Voorhees? The Fisherman is not, and never was, unstoppable. He's a guy, an Average Joe who was initially out for nothing more than simple revenge. But here, in this film, he's taking bullets left and right and actually even survives a fate near the end that will have most everybody reading this laughing in a puddle of their own tears. That, of course, leads me to my second complaint. The closing minutes, once again, infuriatingly leaves everything open for another installment. Yes, you read that correctly. It was practically all I could do to keep my fist from shattering the television screen.

There is absolutely no valid reason, in heaven or on earth, why this movie could not and should not have ended this series. Watch for yourself and dare to tell me I'm wrong. This particular ending, in all honesty, is what drove me to rate the entire film a substandard two stars instead of three. Oh well, live and learn. That's what I say.",1156982400,4,1997,4.7298850574712645
2583953,2,B000FSME9W,"Was this really necessary?. No, not really. The first two were very popular, but the second one put it to death. This latest, direct to DVD film is not so much a continuing sequel as it is a total re-hash of the first film. I wonder how Lois Duncan feels about where her little book has gone. It's been 8 years since the last film, and no one was really crying out for another. I really enjoyed the original, mildly tolerated the second, but was left completely bored with this one. No Jennifer Love Hewitt. No big cleavage. No seaside atmosphere. Why even bother?. I enjoy a good set-up, and the original was fine in that area, but this film takes way too long. We don't get our first glimpse of the fisherman killer until 38 minutes into the film. The first fisherman kill is 42 minutes into the film. The story?. Well, it pretty much covers the original with a few new spins. A group of friends stage a prank one 4th of July in a little Colorado town that results in a horrible tragedy. They agree to keep it a secret. One year later, they begin receiving horrible messages and people start dropping. Sound familiar?. A few things were modernized. For instance, our killer is now text messaging his notes. Welcome to 2006 fisherman!. Our heroine is cute, but generic Amber(Brooke Nevin), and the fodd...er, I mean her friends, are a bunch of kids from ""cliche casting"". Most of the acting is somewhat passable, but it's as routine as it can get. If it weren't for the blood spilling(most of which is towards the climax), this film could be a little thriller on Lifetime. The killer this tim around is not as creepy as he has been, and the revelation of the killer is a huge disappointment that takes the series and the character into a different direction. The killer is played by Halloween 5's Michael Myers, Don Shanks, and that's him as the cop in the ambulence at the end. The gore and violence is okay, but except for one death, it's nothing special. The dialogue, especially in the beginning, felt as if it could of come from a slasher film from 1988. One good scene involves a nightime ride in a Gondola in a storm, and that's about it. The production values are okay, and better than other straight to DVD horror sequels. But folks, the series and fisherman was showing weakness in the second film, and here, it just collapses. I seriously hope this guy gets alzheimers and forgets what these kids keep doing every summer.",1156896000,,2433,4.519274376417234
2583954,1,B000FSME9W,"Lets be honest. I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER were less than average horror movies. Throw backs to the original killer teenager one after the other format. STORY? Simplistic at best. The selling point? LOVE HEWITT. GELLAR.

Quite simply, these movies prove that all you need is a hot popular girl... maybe two... and who cares how good of a story you have to tell.

So, along comes I'LL ALWAYS KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. Same simplistic plot. Guy with hook knows you know what you did and wants you to know that what you did is gonna get you hooked. Except... theres no LOVE HEWITT. There's no GELLAR. There's not even a MOESHA... so why watch?

So, if you want to watch 5 more teens get skewered and you don't care about your precious time being wasted, then go for it.

Production value took a hit. Star power took a hit. Script is the same or worse. Movie straight to video for good reason.",1156723200,24,941,4.329545454545454
2583955,2,B000FSME9W,"Aside from the clever twist at the end, this third entry in the I KNOW...series is pretty derivative and not that scary.  No one from the previous two movies is around in this one, though the legend of the Fisherman still exists.

A prank gone wrong on a Fourth of July leads four teenagers to make a pact of secrecy in telling how their young friend died.  Of course, we meet them a year later and someone is sending messages to the crew, saying..I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER...soon each of the teens is picked off and we're left to wonder who the killer is.  No real standout performances from the cast of unknowns, but I will admit the identity of the killer is surprising.  Probably will be the last in this franchise that's grown too familiar to be interesting.",1156550400,,769,4.425531914893617
2583956,2,B000FSME9W,"Basically ""I'll Always Know..."" tells the SAME story as the original, so don't expect anything new and unique in this made-for-DVD entry. So it's a little surprising that this movie ALMOST works well under the circumstances. Despite some initial slow moments, the film is actually fairly intriguing..it is well directed, has some not-bad performances for this kind of low-grade fodder, some decent gore, and a few ""jump"" moments, which is a lot more than you can say about most direct-to-DVD drivel. I especially liked the whodunnit angle...until they actually showed who done it. Trust me, you will be left scratching your head at the film's unfortunate choice of killer, and the rather dull ending. I had it pegged as one of the main characters, which would have made more sense and made the film pretty close to a home run. The movie's attempt at a ""surprise"" ending ultimately killed the film as a whole. If nothing else, it keeps up the tradition in this series, in that all 3 films had terrible endings. Maybe the next film (and You Know There Will Be One) will finally get it right.",1156464000,2,1089,4.767195767195767
2583957,4,B000FSME9W,i liked and disliked this movie.  what i liked about it it was more gruesome than the first two. what i didn't like about it was that they made the killer like a monster or alien and can only be killed by his riginal hook!!!! what is up with that!!! whatever happened to the real human killer. whatver happened to ben willis???? like the other two it leaves you hanging. there might be another one to the series but you never know!!!,1156204800,,433,4.280487804878049
2583958,5,B000FSME9W,"To me, this was the best of the bunch.  The writing was very good, solid acting and some really great suspenseful scenes.  Highly recommend this one.",1155859200,3,149,4.6923076923076925
2583969,3,B000FSME9W,"Well, the third movie basically uses the same exact plot mechanism as the original movie--4 kids, 2 boys, 2 girls--do something bad on july 4th...then a year later, have all stopped talking to each other, but have to come together when they realize the 'urban legend' about the fisherman may have come true.

The biggest problem with this entry in the series is it is SLOW. it's only an hour and a half but it really drags--even between murders. There are a couple of quite inventive hook moments and some typical fun gore, and to bring the series into the new millennium, there are plenty of short quick ""The Ring"" edits, as well as a very Ring-like tree that keeps appearing for some odd reason.

Unfortunately, the ending of the film, which attempts to be a shocking twist, since you've been trying to guess all along who it is, pretty much blows the entire movie, putting the series into desperation mode. Luckily, the suspense moments leading up to the outcome are sort of fun.

Still, this is no top notch slasher, and as a sequel, it's simply a rehash. Worth having to complete your ""I Know What You Did"" series, though.",1155600000,21,1127,4.597014925373134
2583970,2,B000FSME9W,"Having just seen a press advance of this movie, I thought I'd post my first impressions.

I'll confess to being caught up in the teen slasher craze of the late nineties - movies like Scream and Urban Legend really floated my boat back then, and to a lesser extent, still do. I Know what You Did Last Summer and its over-criticised sequel certainly slotted into this category nicely.

A sequel more or less in name only, the plot sees a group of teenage friends deciding to keep the death of their friend in a backfired prank a secret... one year later, in the days leading up to the tragedy's anniversary, the four receive ominous 'I Know...' messages before being picked off one by one by a hooded character in the 'Fisherman' outfit from the first two movies. Who could possibly know what they did? Is it someone out for revenge? Or is the original fisherman back to wreak more havoc?

From the box art (and the seven year delay) it was clear that this was never going to have the same high production values or quality acting as those late nineties slashers, but I didn't quite expect as far a drop as this. White's direction, while lacking any genuine drawn-out suspense, is at least edgy and 'hip'; sadly, acting from all but the pretty lead Brooke is decidedly wooden. Four or five minutes into the movie, you can see why Sony decided to bypass a cinema release in favour of a straight-to-video one.

That said, if taken as a low budget teen slasher in the vein of 'The Pool' and 'Lover's Lane', it actually works quite well. The true identity of the fisherman is well hidden, with various red herrings keeping the audience guessing. The special effects appear to have consumed a large chunk of the budget, too - one gutting, akin to the 'hook in the throat' from the first 'I Know...' movie, is particularly gruesome.

Ultimately, I felt let down by the ending - but I would imagine everyone's opinion would really depend on their reaction to the killer's identity. As a sequel to what I consider two of the most enjoyable slashers of the late nineties, 'I'll Always Know...' fails miserably. Taken as a standalone low budget slasher, there's more of a hook. 2.5 / 5.",1155254400,7,2174,4.57840616966581
2583971,1,B000FSME9W,"I think this movie is going to suck. It took them 8 freakin' years to make the third in the trilogy.

2583972,2,B000FSME9W,"I am interested to see if its good or not. Somehow the kids in the movie are supposedly related to the original cast.

She doesn't even act in this movie, they just chose some random kids from the High School Acting Class... Besides, what is this about, anyway?

They shouldn't have gone on with the sequel, there's nothing else to do. What is this going to be..New kids who supposedly kill Ben Willis again, and he again comes kill them? Come on! After the two original movies this one is not even closer!!!

But, by hook or by crook, they were going to proceed.  In this offering, the Fisherman has now reached legendary status.  Hes mythical and omnipresent.  Flits about like a butterfly, now you see him now you dont.  He can slash a tire in the middle of nowhere without being seen.  He haunts a group of friends almost responsible for the death of another through a silly practical joke.  Someone stalks them, leaves messages, kills the weakest link sending them into a panic.  The survivors run around until they die horribly.  Collateral damage proves no one is safe.
