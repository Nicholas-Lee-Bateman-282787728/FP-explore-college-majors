8366764,5,B002E2QH54,"This is a 4 disc guided tour by Mike Freeman to all of the places
Elvis was known to frequent. It starts out in Memphis and goes
to Tupelo and Nashville. this is probably for Hard core Elvis fans
like myself. The pace is very slow and educational. Mike interviews
many people who new Elvis as a child to when superstardom was
just around the corner. I thought i knew a lot about Elvis but
this set really surprised me. i learned a lot more stuff about EP.
Mike takes you by car and drives to all of these places, something
you could not do on regular tour. If you are a real Elvis fan
you should get a kick out of this set. Rock on. Dave Freeman",1263340800,8,645,4.046875
