4397256,1,B004KNO77A,I bought Breaking Up is Hard To Do because of the cheap price... plus sometimes some D-list movies are GEMS... It's not the case with this movie. The plot & acting were less than superb.. I enjoy Demetria McKinney work sometimes in Tyler Perry's plays & movies.. but this was one script she should have left alone. :(,1328313600,,317,4.482758620689655
4397257,4,B004KNO77A,"Great movie. I lerned a little bit about and from the movie. You don't see a lot of black movies that talk about love, relationships, and then getting counseling because you want it to work. no matter the struggle blood is always thicker than water.",1318896000,,249,4.555555555555555
4397258,2,B004KNO77A,"I love Demetria Mckinney because she is the bomb in House Of Payne.  This movie is so boring I almost felled to sleep on it.  The movie is taken place in a office with Demetria and her husband talking to a counseler about their marriage.  The whole time in the movie Demetria is using vulgor language because she is angry with her husband about their marriage problems.  The movie has a dumb storyline and should not have been made.  I am so sorry I wasted my money on this movie. If you love bootleg, budgeted movies than this is the one to buy.  Maybe next time Demetria because this was a total disaster.",1316563200,,607,4.327433628318584
4397259,4,B004KNO77A,"If I had to give this movie a grade it would be a C+ primarily because there was character development issues my opinion.  The lead female character really irked the heck out of me and I felt we (the audience) never really got a chance to see what her core issues were that made her so angry.  She just came across as a really foul-mouth, ungrateful, nag who couldn't recognize a good think if it bit her in the face.  I also think the director could have cut out at least 30 minutes of the movie at varying points without losing continuity of the story line; 2hrs is way too long. On a positive note the issues they dealt with in this film was very real and were dealt with in a real manner.  And although this movie would fall in the category of ""low budget"" I thought it was done well enough to make one forget that.  I can understand why some people would really like this movie.  I imagine many will relate to it as well... not so much for me.",1312156800,4,948,4.1530054644808745
4397260,5,B004KNO77A,This was a great movie! Real issues in relationships. It is nice to see a couple deal with their problems and work things out.,1310947200,3,126,4.291666666666667

4397262,5,B004KNO77A,"Tabari and Nikki you two did an amazing job writting and producing this!! I loved this movie from beginning to end. First off I LOVE Demetria McKinney in anything, but this?? Her emotional range was SICK!!!!!! I loved her portrayal as Shonda 'Potty Mouth' Jenkins. Kendrick Cross did an amazing job as Vince also. Don't sleep on this movie at all!! The storyline was great and it came togther perfectly. The only critique i did have was the sound was off at times, but other than that GREAT MOVIE. I have watched this a gazillion times since it arrived on 5/13/11. I am an official BLUE LION CLUB fan!! Many blessings!",1306281600,2,618,4.576576576576577
4397263,2,B004KNO77A,"This movie was not good.  It was a long, low budget movie.  I only watched it till the end because I didn't want to waste my money.  Thankfully it was only a rental or I would have put it up for sale.  I gave it two stars because I like Demetria.  She act just like she acts on House of Payne but with a potty mouth.",1306108800,,316,3.727272727272727
4397264,5,B004KNO77A,I SO LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!It takes you to the core of what you must do in order to keep your relationship. I think that all couples whether or not they are married should do this. They fought for what made them fall in love for in the end they caught each other and when you fall that is the point. To be caught. I recommend this to all and give this film a 10+.,1306022400,,364,3.9324324324324325

4397268,4,B004KNO77A,I think this is a good relationship movie although it only touches on the outer rim of what all couples go through. You have to start somewhere.,1383177600,,144,4.37037037037037

4397270,5,B004KNO77A,Breaking up is hard to do was cute and so very to some relationships I've seen in the time we're living in. Great cast I told my friends it is a must see.,1367452800,,154,3.696969696969697
4397271,3,B004KNO77A,Have not look at it yet but plan to do so this summer when time permits.  Purchased it because it is a black move.,1365638400,,114,3.75
4397272,4,B004KNO77A,the couple in the story had true life relationship issues. The way that some women want to control our men by picking ang chosing their friends but never really understanding the true dynamics of that friendship.,1353024000,,212,4.916666666666667

4397274,5,B004KNO77A,"This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in a while.  One moment I was laughing and the next moment I was crying.  This relationship movie is not just for the ladies.  Men will love it too.  The acting of the leading roles and supporting roles was great!  Demetria McKinney from ""Tyler Perry's House of Payne"" made you hate her and then love her.  And Kendrick Cross from ""Colored Girls"" is surely going to be a rising star we need to look out for.  However, the character ""Slice"" played by Tabari Sturdivant was my favorite. He is the movie's Bad Boy!  The movie has a lot of adult language that makes it inappropriate for children but it was essential to one of the characters personality traits.  Buy it...you'll love it!",1339113600,2,730,4.46969696969697
4397275,4,B004KNO77A,"This,although often humourous,shows how easy it is to let relationships fall into disrepair by the busyness of life as well as disrespect and apathy. But also how hard it is to break up once there have been strong feelings. Nothing is ever as easy as it seems.",1331510400,,260,4.553191489361702

8433185,3,B004KNO77A,"This movie was OK. Demetria McKinney's character I couldn't get with the cussing until it was explained in the plot why she had such a potty mouth. Otherwise, the movie was good especially the end in the therapist office. (praying scene was awesome!!!)",1492819200,,252,4.883720930232558
8433186,1,B004KNO77A,"Low budget, bad acting (by the sisters, the therapist, and even Ms Ida)  The whole movie sounds like it was shot in bathroom. I kept waiting for it to get better but by then I was too far into the movie to turn it off.",1491004800,,218,3.8444444444444446
