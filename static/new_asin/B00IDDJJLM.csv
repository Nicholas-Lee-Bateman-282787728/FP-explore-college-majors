8641258,1,B00IDDJJLM,"I am basically just writing this as a warning to anyone who might do what I did and impulsively purchase this disc because it's an 80's Kevin Bacon two-fer.  The fact that it's a two-fer is fine but the movies are both full screen.  It's ultimately my own fault for not thoroughly checking the description, I know, but given that the cover of this movie set shows the current covers for both Quicksilver and White Water Summer DVD's which are widescreen I assumed these were the same versions--they are not.  And you know what they say about assuming...

WWS really needs to be in widescreen--the movie itself is mildly creepy in a way and mediocre at best but the best part about it is the scenery and perhaps the cheesy 80's soundtrack, which actually is sort of epically corny but awesome at the same time.  My point is that when the high point in a film is the visuals and backdrop you don't want to see it cropped and screwed up in full screen mode.  Not sure about the other film as I have never seen it.  I assume it probably matters to those of us who like movies.  :P

Additionally it is not as though this disc is ""cheap"" at about twelve bucks.  You're better off purchasing these films individually.  You will pay about the same price (currently, anyway) and you will have the superior widescreen versions!",1401840000,3,1317,4.491596638655462
