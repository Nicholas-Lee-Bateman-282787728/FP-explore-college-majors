8302128,3,B001FL3K8W,"<strong>Bratgirl</strong> (Paul Thomas, 1992)

I used to be of the ""porn is porn"" variety of casual adult moviegoer who came of age (at least, of age to watch porn--I have never ""come of age"" vis-a-vis the maturity factor) after the mid-eighties, when ""porn"" became synonymous with ""endless variations on the money shot"". It was only a few years ago, when I was introduced to adult films of the sixties and seventies--when porn had plot, semi-believable characters, and atmosphere by the cubic yard--that I started understanding how badly those of us under the age of, say, fifty have been served by the current porn industry. And in my viewing, I quickly developed a rule of thumb: the last good porn film was made in 1984. I have not yet tracked that movie down, but pretty much everything I've seen made before 1984 was an ""adult film"" with the emphasis on the latter word, and everything I've seen from after that year is an ""adult film"" with the emphasis on the former word.

There are, of course, exceptions to that rule. Almost all of them fall on the ""yes, porn was bad in the seventies"" side. And thus I was even more surprised by <em>Bratgirl</em>, a silly superhero hardcore flick from 1992 that is enjoyable far more for its campiness and enthusiasm than it is for its bog-standard post-1984 sex scenes (wooden, undramatic, too many close-ups of genitalia and not nearly enough full-body shots or facial close-ups).

Plot: Julianne (Julianne James, who collaborated with Thomas and scriptwriter Mark Weiss on a series of Brat videos between 1988 and 1994) is a typical valley girl, obsessed with nothing but fashion, until she's in the process of buying a high-end dress at a fashion boutique and, while trying to come up with an alternate form of payment when her credit card is declined, has the dress whisked out from under her by Leona (porn superstar Hyapatia Lee). I'm not going to try and follow the needlessly labyrinthine plot through the next twenty minutes, but suffice to say that (a) Leona is actually supervillain Feline, who plans to corner the high-fashion market by flooding the world with polyester, and (b) she kidnaps Julianne's boyfriend Mort (Tom Byron, another porn superstar, who has as of this writing appeared in over fifteen hundred[!!] movies), who bears a passing resemblance to superstar designer Vermicelli, and forces him to release a taped statement declaring that synthetic fabrics are the wave of the future. What's a girl to do but become a superhero in the service of truth, justice, and organic cotton? (Not to mention sex. Lots of sex.)

Yes, you can probably fap to it--there's a reason Hyapatia Lee was one of porn's most popular stars in the eighties despite making just thirty-six films. But then, that's a secondary consideration here, which is obviously one of the things that separates <em>Bratgirl</em> from most other porn films made after 1985. It is, of course, terribly acted, but it's at least competently shot, the script is too smart to take itself at all seriously, and everyone involved had a ball, pardon the pun, making this movie. It's funny, it's weirdly absorbing, and while it's not at all the movie I'd point to if you've never seen a <em>good</em> porn flick before (that will forever be <em>Behind the Green Door</em>), this is a fun one if you know what you're doing. Also of note: it features the last onscreen performances (to date) of pre-1984-back-when-porn-movies-were-good star Tantala Ray and mid-to-late-eighties superstar Barbara Dare. ** ",1341532800,3,3526,4.959390862944162
