8269427,5,B0018CMJNU,"Please release ""One West Waikiki"" on dvd. This was a great show. I know several people who have wanted to buy the series.",1328918400,,121,4.304347826086956
8269428,5,B0018CMJNU,I've been looking for this Series on VHS and then on DVD since it went off the air.  Usually I don't even get a reply back on my search for the name.  Now I get a response and it says it is no longer available.  When was it available?  Why would they take it off the market?  I loved this show and I want it on DVD.  Please bring it back or give me the name and address of the manufacturer and I'll write to them.,1251072000,4,413,3.744186046511628
8269429,5,B0018CMJNU,"I am another fan of this show that is extremely disappointed that it's release has been canceled. There are many, many others far worse than this one that are available. The chemistry between the always gorgeous Cheryl Ladd and Richard Burghi, coupled with the beautiful Hawaiin scenery, made it worth watching. Hopefully, the studios will change their minds and make us One West Waikiki fans happy!",1227312000,13,399,5.0606060606060606
8269430,5,B0018CMJNU,"I remember this show when it came out and I loved it then and as a huge Richard Burgi fan would have snapped this up in a heartbeat.

I do hope that the decision not to bring it out is reversed and that all the episodes are released; it was a lot of fun and RB and CL had a great snarky relationship.",1217289600,10,300,3.761904761904762
8269431,5,B0018CMJNU,"Richard Burgi is a fine versatile actor. OWW is a delightful showcase for his talents. A fun show.
Will it be available again soon?",1217203200,3,131,4.5
8269432,5,B0018CMJNU,The character of Mac Wolfe played by Richard Burgi is a delight. His running banter with Cheryl Ladd keeps the series fresh and inviting. The Hawaiian location is a treat for they eye not to mention Mr. Burgi's ever delightful physique.,1217203200,3,236,4.780487804878049
