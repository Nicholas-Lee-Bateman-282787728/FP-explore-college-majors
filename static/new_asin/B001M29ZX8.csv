I had originally signed up for a month of classes with Aventura Dance through a deal on Groupon. When I got there they told me that in order to use the deal I had to sign up as a member for another month of classes. Later I found out that this was not true, and that other customers were not forced to do this.

Nonetheless, I decided to use the money that I had paid for the membership to use towards classes (not as a monthly membership.) This was in October of 2009. I then cancelled my membership, so that I would not be charged the monthly membership charges. I remember signing the form that was part of my file to cancel the membership at that time. In February of 2010 I noticed that I had still been charged every month since that time, so for 4 months after I had cancelled my membership. This was a total of $388 that I had been charged after the cancellation of my contract.

I contacted them to stop charging me and give me a refund for the months that i was overcharged for. The did stop charging me but I never received a refund. When I attempted to call repeatedly they did not answer or call me back. I called regularly for a long time, and finally their number was disconnected and they weren't in their locaion. I assumed they had closed. Then in spring of 2011 I saw another advertisement for the company so I called to have my situation resolved. They continued the same game of not answering my phone call, or when I wouldn't give up they'd tell me that they were working on it, and I should receive my refund within a few days. This still never happened so I went there to discuss the issue.

The owner was very rude and fed me the same lines. He has since e-mailed me and told me that I did not cancel my contract until Feb of 2010, which is a total lie. If they keep honest track of their records, they would see that I cancelled it in October of 2010. From what I have read about the owner, Moshe Raiser on discussion boards, however he is consistently doing things like this, is dishonest, and a thief. I do not doubt that he would have deleted the record of my cancellation in order to support his claim. he is now refusing to communicate with me and I feel very frustrated and adgry with this whole process.",1307491200,,2313,4.25
