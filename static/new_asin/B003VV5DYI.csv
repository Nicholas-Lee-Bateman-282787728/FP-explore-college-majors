4212163,3,B003VV5DYI,"OMG when I saw this I was happy to see some classic Disney cartoons that I watched as a kid back when the Disney Channel rocked and before it became a shadow of its former self. This DVD/streaming video were great for the memorable shorts I use to love back in the day. The reason I gave it three stars is because half way through the video, the editors decided to fill the rest of the time with shorter versions of the episodes on the DVD as well as add a strange music video in the end. What were they thinking? I will not buy another one until they decrease the price. If they are going to do that, then it is only worth 3 dollars max. Who wants to see the same episodes of show they just saw but shorter in length. That was a stupid choice on Disney's part. They could have added more content other than that. Anyways, I recommend it if you like Donald and Mickey but be warned of the crackpot editing and lame music video at the end of the first 39 minutes or so.",1327536000,2,968,4.0732984293193715
4212164,1,B003VV5DYI,"If you are thinking of purchasing this DVD in hopes of some classic Mickey Mouse cartoons? Then will you be disappointed. These are essentially three types of ""remixes"":

- ""BLAM!"" This is just clips of the classic cartoons with cheesy 90's type narrations and an obnoxious high school dropout shouting the word ""BLAM!!!"" every time Donald Duck is hit on the head with something or another. Search ""Disney Blam"" on YouTube to experience this travesty for yourself.

- ""Re-Micks"" These are Mickey Mouse shorts mixed up to modern music. (Hannah Montana, Jonas Brothers). Great toons, terrible songs.

- ""Short Versions"" These are just the shorts cut down and re dubbed to about three minutes long instead of 8. The interesting thing about these is that we get to hear Brett Iwane as Mickey, as Wayne Allwine passed away last year.

In conclusion DO NOT BUY. Go for the Walt Disney Treasures sets instead. These have the cartoons uncut and with a great deal of extras.",1311120000,9,965,4.83030303030303
4212165,5,B003VV5DYI,"I bought this mainly for my girls, but of course I was excited to see some movies that I remember seeing as a kid.  My daughters love it!  Especially my 3 year old.  She wants to watch it all the time over and over again.  The only complaint I have is the option they give when playing all the films.  It bugs me that they have the long and short version playing right after one another when you hit 'play all'.  It bothers my 3 year old too.  She'll say, ""I just watched this one Mom""!  Other than that it gives great entertainment and even though it's not identical in every way when we first watched these as kids, they did a great job of recreating something that isn't out there anymore.  We all love them and I'm glad I bought it.",1299801600,,736,4.126760563380282
4212166,2,B003VV5DYI,I did not realize that this video was an old version of Mickey- Donald etc. My grandaughter couldn't relate to the old style charachters.,1299369600,,137,4.75
4212167,5,B003VV5DYI,Many people forget these movies are intended for young children and my daughter absolutely loves them!  We have volume 1 and 2 and she watches them both at least 5 times a week.  It is also fun for me as alot of the cartoons are the same ones I watched as a kid.  If your shopping for your child this DVD is A+.,1298419200,,311,3.9047619047619047
4212168,5,B003VV5DYI,"Got this for my 2 year old this christmas.  I think we have watched it 10 times in a week along with have a laugh 1.  These are the shorts on disney channel along with their longer versions.  Wish there were more shorts than added extras, but the kids love it.",1293926400,,260,4.0588235294117645
4212169,1,B003VV5DYI,"I watched this today for the first time, playing it all the way through.  They have the main cartoon, each time followed by a shorter version of the same exact cartoon you just watched!  It's bogus.  Like 1/3 of the playing time is just repeating what's playing the other 2/3 of the time.  I wish I could return it to the store, but it's already opened.  We have volume 1 with Mickey on the cover, and I'm waiting until I'm less cranky to watch it since I'm sure they did the same thing.  We opened that one, too, unfortunately.",1293494400,6,528,4.282828282828283
4212170,3,B003VV5DYI,"Though these DVD's may have received many negative reviews I think the people that reviewed them may not really understand where the concept of them came from. Sometimes in between shows on the Disney Channel and Disney XD they play a shortened version of classic cartoons they title the segment Have a Laugh! They also play the Blam series. It is usually shown during the hours that slightly older children would be watching it. So I understand why Disney decided to package it this way.

My mom purchased these DVD's for my 2 year old. While visiting my parents my father pulled out some videos he had with the old cartoons my daughter really likes them (She is a big fan of mickey and the rest of the gang). So my Mom came across these and bought them for her. My daughter really enjoys them so I am not going to review them for anything but the entertainment value they provide my child. I wouldn't recommend them for someone who is looking for the classics because they love them and want to have them as part of the collectibles, but if you are looking to entertain your child then for the price they are just fine.

My only real complaint about them is when you hit play all you have to watch the long and short version of all the cartoons. I would rather they had a selection for view all -unedited and view all -short version or omit the short versions all together. Though I know those are the ones they are showing on the segment on TV so that would probably not happen.",1293321600,7,1481,4.381818181818182
4212171,1,B003VV5DYI,"I thought Disney had moved beyond this type of nonsense with Eisner's departure.  Not sure who thought that this was a good idea, but they might be better suited to working on scripts for sitcoms....  These folks should be ashamed.  Don't even think about wasting your hard earned money on these (and this is from someone who owns more than 300 Disney titles....).",1291766400,5,364,4.746031746031746
4212172,1,B003VV5DYI,"In addition to the Blam garbage they also include the classic cartoons (which have all been previously released on DVD) and include cut versions which are down to about three minutes with new recored dialogue, new music and new sound effects. In addition, the uncut version is also included. This stuff is okay for the children, but not the adults. All we want is classic Disney not classic Disney being tampered with. If it aint broke then don't fix it!!",1288396800,5,455,4.7

4212175,3,B003VV5DYI,"Love these cartoons, such fun! The playback is a tad annoying in that if you hit ""play all"" (which I prefer) then it plays each episode TWICE in a row - one is the full length cartoon & one is a shortened version. Your only other option is to sit there with the remote & play the episodes individually. Wish this was done better, but still love the cartoons, & so does our grandson. :D",1475798400,2,385,4.1466666666666665
4212176,1,B003VV5DYI,"I am disappointed with this purchase. I have a little one  who loves Mickey and the gang, but what I did not like about this was the unkindness and bad attitudes portrayed. Not something I want my little one exposed to at this point in his young life. They also repeat the same cartoon right within the volume! I don't understand that at all. I wish I had listened to the review and not purchased this.",1474156800,,402,4.2894736842105265
4212177,2,B003VV5DYI,"The run time is misleading. Really great first half of classic Mickey cartoons, but then the same cartoons are repeated with a border around them. The last portion of the movie is Mickey characters shenanigans being replayed with an annoying voice over that is yelling like some awful monster truck announcer of the 90's. He continually yells ""BLAAAAAM!,"" forcing me to turn off the television while my toddler yells at me. When I turn on the Amazon app I pray she doesn't ask for, ""Donald Duck one"" because then I know I will have to disappoint her... Because there's no way I can accidentally let it play to the announcer part while I'm doing the dishes ever again. I just can't do it.",1471910400,5,687,4.59349593495935

4212182,5,B003VV5DYI,"This is wonderful! I don't understand the negative reviews about the older animation; the animation is classic! As far as being remastered, the animation just looks cleaned up-- no scratches and it isn't blurry like some old cartoons can get when transferred to digital media (Casper, I'm looking at you). Its the original Disney magic and, in my opinion, much better than anything on television today. My kids love this, they just laugh and laugh and I have a great time sitting with them and reliving my own childhood.",1459987200,,520,4.853932584269663

4212185,4,B003VV5DYI,"the commercial portion is really long.  also, i thought this would be just Donald Duck cartoons... hoping for ones with him and Chip 'n' Dale.  but the cartoons are equal parts Donald and Goofy with a little Mickey.  still good, just not what i had in mind.  but my daughter loves them all so i can't really complain",1458000000,,316,4.396551724137931
4212186,5,B003VV5DYI,We own a copy and me and my four year old daughter LOVE it. It cute classic shorts. I can't wait to own the entire set and only wish there were more.,1454630400,,149,3.6875
4212187,4,B003VV5DYI,"Volume 2 of Have A Laugh contains 5 more uncut classic Disneytoon shorts (including Clock Cleaners being completely unaltered, right down to Donald's often-misunderstood-&-misinterpreted dialogue to the mainspring!), with 5 edited versions of them side-by-side like in volume 1, plus 3 whacko BLAM shorties like in volume 1, and 1 Re-Micks music video, this time by Hannah Montana (the kids watching Disney Channel today might ask, ""Hannah who?"", even though she was the channel's Golden Girl from 2006 to 2011, as unfunny as her show was when compared to sitcom gems like Family Matters or Sanford and Son, & the monotony of how often her music played at the time, and this was all before Frozen stole hers and Mickey & his gang's thunder! But I digress, with volume 2 of Have A Laugh, you won't have to see the uncut and revised shorts side-by-side, via Play All, after this one! Volumes 3 and 4 show the uncut shorts, then BLAMs and a Re-Micks, THEN the edited shorts, through Play All in that order. I've noticed with Have A Laugh prints of the uncut shorts, many of their copyright dates are off by up to 7 years, if not more, when compared to earlier prints already in other DVD collections that are now in the Disney Vault! And people think Chip 'n' Dale were nutty? Sometimes the dates are still off whenever Turner Classic Movies shows the shorts at certain times of the year, even though Have A Laugh ended in 2013, and the shorts are still being restored in HD today, for online viewing on their own. Like I keep saying, just be thankful for what you still have, in terms of classic Disneytoon shorts DVDs of the past that are now in the Disney Vault!",1450137600,,1662,4.5993265993265995

But seriously...he is giggling right now, watching the old videos we all remember.  Lighten up, people.  Great format.  I have no problem with it....We will be purchasing the entire series.
