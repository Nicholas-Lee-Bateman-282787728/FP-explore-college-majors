8705432,2,B00UCOMJ4Y,"These 2012-2014 programmes, made by Channel 4 and BSkyB, are meant to be a spoof on police dramas.  Each of the three discs is 90 minutes plus some extras.  I prefer satire and have a dry sense of humour;  I did not enjoy this at all. Just like many other popular comedies, it was too in-your-face for me; although I'm sure others might like it.  I only watched the first 20 minutes before the (defective) disc began to stutter; returned the lot for a refund.",1426464000,,459,4.364705882352941
