8398381,5,B003JP4KVI,I loved this movie better than any other Jaws rip-off or even official Jaws movie! James Franciscus and Vic Morrow were fantastic as well as the supporting actors. The storyline is suspenseful and the scenes were scarier than the ones from Speilberg's movie and its sequels. Good old Enzo G Catellari!,1304208000,,301,4.921568627450981
8398382,5,B003JP4KVI,"'The Last Shark' has been restored from a fairly well kept Italian 35mm print (Intro and Credits are in English, must be from a different print) that has obviously had some slight fading and scratches. The company that released this DVD obviously missed a few things..

First off, the audio changes now and then. For example, during the Regatta, there is a part where the audio goes from bad sounding mono to beautiful sounding stereo...this also happens in the end credits.

During the beginning, when the film companies logo is being shown, there is NO audio. If you have heard of 'Variety', the film company, you will know the infamous tune that plays in their intro's, it is absent here.

Also, there are some digital artifact's that occur during 2 scenes. One when the local teens are talking about killing the shark and when the Governor is having a discussion about what do about the shark.

The menu and everything else is perfect, just those flaws and a few more things. Don't get me wrong, I love this version compared to the dark and over saturated Japanese VHS release from the 90's. If anything, the studio could have tried and found a better English audio track as the one on the DVD is just god-awful.

The DVD itself is a DVD-9 but the film can fit on a DVD-5, any film that can fit on a single layer that is longer than an hour has been compressed a bit too much.

The good thing about this DVD is that it is 16x9 Enhanced and its PAL. That makes the resolution a lot better if you understand the differences between PAL and NTSC.",1281571200,,1547,4.468085106382978
