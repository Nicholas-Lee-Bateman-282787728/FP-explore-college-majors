8252509,5,B0013P6TLA,"This special is pretty funny. I thought that most of the comedians were hilarious. there was one guy that was not that funny. but my favorites are. George Lopez, Gabriel Iglasies, and everyone else. I don't remember their names. but I laughed the hardest when George and Gabriel were on. all in all it was pretty funny. if you have not seen this dvd then I recommend you do",1368748800,,373,4.420289855072464

While Gabriel's tape was outstanding this tape was not quite as good. While all nine comedians had their merits I only found four of them TRULY hilarious:  George Lopez, Gabriel Iglesias, Joey Medina and Rick Majera. The rest of them were only fair in comparison. It might be just a matter of taste. What I find funny might not be what another reviewer thinks is extremely comical. I guess it all boils down to life experience. I am one reviewer who used to love watching the George Lopez television show and have admired Gabriel Iglesias refreshing and ""fluffy"" style since first watching him on COMEDY CENTRAL. I wasn't as familiar with Joey Medina but he is, like Gabriel Iglesias, this warm, overweight guy who is truly talented at what he does. Rick Majera playing the customs cop is truly an original.

While this may not be my most favorite comedy tape it is still very good and worth owning. I would recommend it for some good laughs!",1295740800,,1250,5.573684210526316
