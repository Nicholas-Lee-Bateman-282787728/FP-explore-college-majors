7666394,2,B01BSW1NXQ,Its at best a B rate movie with D rate actors.  The best part of the movie was when it was over.  However it is a good story bout moving up with life.  Just over all it sucked.,1468195200,,176,3.5789473684210527

8751184,1,B01BSW1NXQ,The only good thing I can say is that the picture is 16:9. Not being 5.1 surround sound was the first clue that it was not a quality feature which proved to be the case. The story was based in the black environment. After watching half of the movie I watched the next episode of Mozart In The Jungle.,1515369600,,300,4.101694915254237
8751185,5,B01BSW1NXQ,Great  Independent film. Deals with the inner city gangs of New Orleans and the members lives and rising from poverty through crimes. Heavy subject matter lots of action kept me intrigued. Has a good message .Cinematography is what you would expect for an indie film. Overall loved it.,1504742400,,285,4.9375

8751190,1,B01BSW1NXQ,If I could give no stars I would. I honestly don't understand how this even made it on Amazon Prime. Obviously a homemade movie with individuals that have no acting ability. Do not waste your time or money.,1477785600,,206,4.447368421052632
