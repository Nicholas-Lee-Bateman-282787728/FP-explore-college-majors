8480622,2,B005NKS2J8,Unless you absolutely must have a Seger DVD save your money... This is a home video with sub home video sound quality even by 1980s standards. It's only available as an import 'cause it was probably illegally produced.. It's marketed out of Budepest... need I say more?,1329868800,5,269,4.74468085106383
8480623,4,B005NKS2J8,"This concert is from what appears to be from the newer tours after Face The Promise came out, not sure of the exact date but it's from Atlantic City. It captures what we have all been wanting from Bob for many years, a concert DVD. Though it doesn't have all the slick bells and whistles all of us have come to expect in the new DVDs it does capture a very good concert with all the hits new and old. It is raw footage with out of focus camera at times, people walking in front of the camera and a few sound glitches but still worth the money for any Seger fan. I recommend getting this, I don't think you will be disappointed we can only hope that before he calls it quits he puts out the Holy Grail of DVDs.",1327363200,4,709,4.035460992907802
