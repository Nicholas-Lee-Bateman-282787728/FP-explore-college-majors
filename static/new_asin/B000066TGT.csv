7962640,5,B000066TGT,"Vic covers the forehand groundstroke, lob, and slice.  His instructions were easy to follow.
The tape was well produced.  The slow motion repeat and diagrams were better than those found in the Mulit-Segment Forehand and the Consistent Tennis Series with Tom Avery.  I found Multi-Segment Forehand too fast.  Trying to copy the pro's strokes even with slow motion was difficult.
He covers much of the same things that he covers in his book Tennis 2000, but I found the visual reinforcement helpful.
I recommend this video over the others that I mentioned, especially if you haven't picked up any of Vic's books.",1042502400,2,611,4.96078431372549
