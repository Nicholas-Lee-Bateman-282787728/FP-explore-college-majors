7899918,4,779913223X,I bought this for my kids that are in a Chinese immersion program at school. I wanted them to be able to hear people talking besides their teachers so they could get used to it. I also wanted my preschoolers to get used to hearing it. It probably should drop the price in half and I would give it five stars. It does not play on a regular DVD player but we can watch it on our computer. It is Chinese with random English words. The singing is still in English and Spanish.,1430697600,,472,4.086021505376344
