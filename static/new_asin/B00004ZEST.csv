But the MISDEMEANOR DVD ROOOOOOOOOCKS big time and it is a far better performance by a group which is very much alive & kickin', just like the audience is!",1237852800,,462,4.447058823529412
7928641,5,B00004ZEST,"If you think UFO is only a band with Michael Schenker thann don't bother with this DVD.  HOWEVER, if you like all UFO music this is a great DVD.  I have seen other reviews on this page that are negative and I don't know that theese people even bothered to watch (or listen to) the DVD.  The singing is perfect, Phil Moog at his best.  The guitar playing is awesome, the rest of the music sounds very much like the studio releases.  Atomic Tommy is incredible to watch. The ease with which he performs his guitar heroics is incredible to behold.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone intelligent enough to appreciate the Misdemeanor album.  You will not be sorry.  It's not like they are even asking for vey much money for it either.  I was not fortunate enough to see UFO on the Misdemeanor Tour but now I feel like I was there.",1004400000,13,829,4.3311688311688314
7928642,1,B00004ZEST,"This is as Un - UFO - ish as it gets. Just Phil Mogg on vocals from the original line up with Paul Raymond back on keyboards.
Why even carry on at this point? Nothing is worth watching, just a bland going through the motions concerts that is all NEW songs.
CRAP!!!! By the time they get to the encore, they play only 2 Schenker era songs, it wouldn't matter if the blow you away at this point you've seen/heard enough. If you buy this, good, you'll watch it once and then you'll sell it, it's that bad. Take your money and buy a couple of Schenker UFO cd's
instead, money well spent, unlike this garbage.",1001894400,3,604,4.2155172413793105
7928643,3,B00004ZEST,"This title was originally part of several Embassy music releases, they were unique and well filmed, but seemed to miss the energy of the actual artists at a peak period of their career or on ""a good night"".
There is nothing that detracts from this show, except for the fact it was done during UFO reclining years of stardom, they did very well with the guitarists Phil Moog choose for the line-up after Michael Schenker left at the height of their success in the late seventies.
As an owner of an old ragged VHS copy that is now long out of print, I welcome this DVD, as well as the STORY OF UFO: Too hot to Handle, which is also available.",997488000,7,640,4.297520661157025
7928644,1,B00004ZEST,IV'E BEEN A HUGE UFO FAN SINCE THE MID 1970'S  BUT THIS DVD CATCHES ONE OF THE  LOW POINTS OF THEIR CAREER. ALMOST PAINFULL TO WATCH.  SAD! JUST SAD!,993513600,6,149,4.068965517241379
