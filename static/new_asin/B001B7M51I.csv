8282159,4,B001B7M51I,I am a big fan of this Series.  Robson's characters are very well written and I like that they bring in a new one or two each season.  I would recommend this entire series to Adults.  Maybe not suitable for the entire family.,1400112000,,225,4.186046511627907
8282160,4,B001B7M51I,"Not as good as first 2 seasons but not bad when the owners aren't around.  Not a fan of the new owners.  The new owners sucked the life out of the renters, but only when they (the owners) were around. What happened to the newly divorced mother and young son from season one?  They are worth watching.",1395964800,,300,4.228070175438597
8282161,5,B001B7M51I,"This is a canadian sitcom that centers around the tenants of an older apartment building in Vancouver. The tenants are a mix of odd but funny characters. Some of the stars of the show are; Gabrielle Miller, Fred Ewanuick, Alisen Down, Zak Santiago, John Cassini & Dave Foley just to name a few. I've purchased all three seasons & have really enjoyed them.",1341446400,,355,4.650793650793651
8282162,4,B001B7M51I,"This series tracks the idiosyncratic residents of a Vancouver apartment house.  Season Three is the last installment of what became for me an addictive series.  I could hardly wait to see what these loons were pulling next, and I was never disappointed.  The plot twists are always surprising, and the humor quotient is right back up to par with Season One.

With the conclusion of Season Three, I rushed to the computer to see what else was in store for the residents of Robson Arms, and the answer, sadly, is nada.  Talk about disappointment!

If you like to smile and occasionally even guffaw, this talented series is for you.  As I mentioned earlier, it is addictive, but cheaper than hard drugs.  It's also like eating popcorn in that you just can't take one piece and be satisfied.  You must view all three Seasons.

The ending is cynical, shocking, and stunningly honest.  Treat yourself.",1253923200,,895,4.784313725490196

LOVE CORNER GAS. . .REALLY LIKE THE ACTORS IN this series (and Corner Gas) but DEFINITELY DO NOT LIKE THIS SERIES  -- NOT family friendly, HEAVY Sexual content, rather depressing.  If you like the actors THAN buy CORNER GAS",1237852800,2,416,7.625
8282164,5,B001B7M51I,This is a really good Canadian show not as awesome as Corner Gas but still good. I would recomend starting at season 1 or some of this season won't as good since you will not know the back ground of the tenants in Robson Arms apartments.,1231200000,2,237,4.173913043478261
8282165,5,B001B7M51I,The third season continues the quirky series and it is excellent. Dave Foley is outstanding as the new owner of the building.,1228953600,2,125,4.7272727272727275
