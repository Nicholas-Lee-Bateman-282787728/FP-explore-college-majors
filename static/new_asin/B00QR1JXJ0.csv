8692386,5,B00QR1JXJ0,If you take this movie just the way it supposed to be taken it's great! The cool part about it is if you really pay attention there are a lot of cool sneaky references to many movies and Beatles songs. From a a walrus killing people right down to the David Koresh glasses on Manson jr's cute face. Brilliant! I loved it and call it a funny take you back to the day horror film. Buy it. Watch it. Enjoy it for what it is clever fun!,1505433600,,431,3.9655172413793105
8692387,1,B00QR1JXJ0,"Revolution 666 was a bad story with a boring pace. I think its about a zombie cult who awaken a very cheap Walrus masked killer after a DJ plays a dumb song. An out of shape old man in a leather jacket chasing them around Michigan and none of it is believable or entertaining. Hear a few dumb out of place Beatles and Charlie Manson references here and there. The acting and dialog always miss and the special effects are to cheap or nonexistent to really gain any favor among horror fans. Of course it's campy and I appreciate the effort. It was made with a ton of movie love by movie fans on a $5,000 budget so I applaud the effort but it still was unwatchable.",1444176000,,663,4.228346456692913
8692388,3,B00QR1JXJ0,"The story is a very fun, cheeky creative tale that is very entertaining to see unfold. It takes me back to the vinyl days of forcing my albums to play backwards-by hand-hoping to here some kind of witchy message.  The plot has a few quirks unfolding within it that sometimes seem unwarranted or ill-acted but the execution of the storys ideas flow pretty well. There are some nice moments in Revolution 666 that kind of validate the films script. Now it is a very low budget horror in the vein of Death By VHS and Treasure Chest Of Horrors II so the acting is amateurish on a basic level but the lines are very rarely flubbed and more often throw back to the early cult film era in the 80s VHS hayday. The action sequences where the chilling thrills are enacted seem half-hearted and not quite convincingly acted-it would have been nice to see more attention paid to that element of the film because it would have elevated Revolution 666 to the level of Jaissles earliest cult favorites like The Necro Files, and Back From Hell.

The special effects are something that also gets the lessor of attention. They present as cheap, really cheap and are executed on that homemade-horror scale, registering on the lower side of the scale. I wish that a bit more care was taken with the gory effects and blood quality because the cheap-o look takes away from the films overall effect on me as a viewer. However the soundtrack and sound effects utilized in Revolution 666 are hot as hell and become infectious. I really enjoyed those elements a lot. It adds the classic Matt Jaissle signature to the film. If I ever find myself in a horror film sort styled ending to my life I want Matt Jaissle directing the soundtrack to it. Over all this film creates  a lot of what the director intends- groovy cult story, and a cool original killer with the undead slasher character. The acting and dialog often miss and the special effects in the kill scenes are too cheap to really gain favor with most horror fans. For the most part Revolution 666 will disappoint the quality seeking low-budget horror fans but the majority of homemade, D.I.Y horror people will find some timeless, cult entertainment with the film. Ultimately I cant say to see the film is a must, but there is no harm in cheeky fun which is what this film really embodies. Just go into it with caution and little expectations. I do recommend watching Matt Jaissles earliest films first or after to gain full appreciation for the directors twisted but worthy talent.",1432339200,2,2515,4.621923937360179

8692391,5,B00QR1JXJ0,"JAISSLE DOES IT AGAIN!
If you are a fan of zero-budget uber splatter...if Forced Entry just isn't ""edgy"" enough for you...if you think Blood Sucking Freaks is a great ""date movie""...if you describe Eraserhead as ""zany""...if you laughed during  the fetus eating scene in Grim Reaper...then you must be familiar with the collected filmography of Neo-Grindhouse auteur, Matt Jaissle.

I had a rare opportunity to see an early screener, and I wasn't disappointed. Revolution 666 is Jaissle's newest film to date, and perhaps the most legitimate of his shot on video features. Don't get me wrong; it's still the blood soaked, intestine ripping, misogynist  opus you would expect, after the likes of The Necrofiles, but this one has a truly original concept that, despite the obviously non-existent budget, Jaissle pulls off without a hitch.
If I were to tell you it was about a crazed zombie butcher who is revived by a lost record from a 60s era band (I didn't  say The Beatles) and wears a walrus costume while engaging on a  brutal killing rampage...you might ask to buy some of the `shrooms I've been eating...but no. This is the premise for Revolution 666, and damned if Jaissle doesn't make the whole thing gel.

If you are a picker of knits, you may point out the obvious flaws of a no budget feature. However, if you are that kind of person, you've stopped reading this review already and moved on to ""one-click purchase"" the latest Hunger Games BlueRay. BUT, if your list of favorite directors sounds like a menu at an Italian restaurant, and you are a fan of the weird, the grotesque, and the just plain BIZZARE, then you HAVE to see Revolution 666.
