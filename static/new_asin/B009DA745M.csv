5319577,5,B009DA745M,"What a fantastic documentary.  As a child of the 80's, this brought back a lot of memories for me.  I remember being glued to the TV for those Hawk vs. Hosoi battles.  I remember buying a McGill board just because of the McTwist.  I wasn't into skateboarding long once I got into high school but I still love that part of my childhood.  I wish I had stuck with it.  If you were a skateboarder in the 80's then this is a must watch.",1354579200,,431,4.071428571428571
5319578,5,B009DA745M,Not as in depth as Dogtown but still a great look at the icons of skating. Peralta is turning into a great film maker.,1354320000,,118,3.9583333333333335

I love how it lets you see the driving force behind all the different guys, all have their own meaning and are very touching.
Thank you for letting my relive an amazing time in my life.
I have and always will LOVE skateboarding!

5319583,5,B009DA745M,"Be sure to watch ""Dogtown and Z Boys"" which focuses on the skate superstars of the 1970's first, and then proceed immediately to this equally fantastic and compelling documentary, which focuses on the guys who carried the torch through to the 80's and early 90's. Unbelievable archival footage of the Bones Brigade members in action, and great interviews with the guys today.
Even if the skateboarding scene was never your thing, this is still a doc worth watching.",1490918400,,465,4.9743589743589745
5319584,5,B009DA745M,"A great look at the start of skateboarding. Not the start as in people are skating but what you think of today when you hear and see. The history and what this covers is great. Rodney Mullen is a genius and some people are not aware of this. He invented so many tricks. Always the best and very nice, everyone on here is humble and tells the pros and cons of their actions growing up. A great doc and worth the watch!",1490227200,2,417,4.097560975609756

5319626,5,B009DA745M,Interesting next chapter after Z-Boyz. Interview heavy with all the people that should be there. As a skater of the 80s and 90s I very much enjoyed due to the personalities featured. Also I learnt quite a bit as to the development of the sport and marketing of it.,1458172800,,264,4.408163265306122

5319639,5,B009DA745M,Really interesting and well put together documentary.  Like some of the other reviews said though Stacy's part interviewing himself just seems kind of fake I guess.  The way he talks and over dramatizes just kind of turned me off since you know he's interviewing himself.  But really good documentary,1415664000,,300,5.081632653061225

5319645,5,B009DA745M,"I grew up skating during the 80's and all the Bones Brigade videos were constantly running in the background on the tv somewhere. I knew about Rodney Mullen and his dad giving him a hard time about skating, but the in depth trauma that ALL of these guys felt was touching. You can definitely see the impact that skating and Powell Peralta had on these men. Great film!",1376611200,,368,4.426470588235294
5319646,5,B009DA745M,I watched this with my husband who was also a skater back in the day travelling to competitions and exhibitions. He loved it. I must say I wasn't sure at first but it only took a few minutes to be engaged...I truly enjoyed it. It is really worth the rental or even the purchase price!,1373328000,,284,4.181818181818182
5319647,5,B009DA745M,"This skateboarding documentary brings me back to the times I was skating. I was able to skate with some of these guys & watch them blow up in the skateboarding world.
It's a great story about how a few young guys, with great talent, were able to reach the skateboarding (financial) stars!

Just a great flick. Guess you would have had to been skating in the early 80's-90's to know the whole story, but they laid it out really well here.

A MUST WATCH !!",1367020800,,454,4.329411764705882
5319658,4,B009DA745M,"Great movie, has tons of skaters and is very informative about the BB and their early formation. Lots of great early Hawk footage and was nice hearing about how they got along and loved the hard to find footage of the behind the scenes action during shoots and sessions. This is a classic video for any skateboarder past, present, and future.",1365033600,,342,4.622950819672131
5319659,5,B009DA745M,"I was a fan of these skaters and the videos in the 80's, and I loved this film! It's full of great info, commentary, images, and footage- all explaining the story of how this group of skaters came about, dominated, and changed the sport and culture of skateboarding. I found it inspiring because it introduced the personalities of some very unique, and passionate people, who devoted their lives to the one thing they loved the most, and found new ways to make a living at it.",1364428800,,476,4.546511627906977
5319660,5,B009DA745M,"Stacy Peralta is a genius on so many levels.  On a simple level, you could say this is a sequel to Dog Town and Z-Boys.  Where Dogtown reminded me of the smell of skate shops in the mid to late 70's,  Bones Brigade reminds me of the clothes, the shoes, the explosion of skate product we sold in the mid 80s.  I'm 45, so about the same age as most of the guys in the film.

Powell Peralta and the Bones Brigade were certainly the clean-cut kids (like i was) and were the epitome of perfection.  This movie is no different.  Seeing the old photos from Skateboarder/Action Now and remember getting them each month can bring back memories just like an old song, but these seem even more special.  Of course, in the magazines you get a very refined impression of what the skaters were all about.  Seeing them talk about the old days, and how things behind the magazine spots weren't as peachy as they might have seemed.  I love documentaries, which I probably watch 10 to 1 over other feature films.  I know Stacy has done other films, and I'm going to make more of an effort to see what they are now.  I really recommend this film to anyone interested in skating, as the footage and history is fantastic.  I think this would also be a good family film for teens and their parents.  There is some colorful language, though not as colorful as the 80s clothing.

Note:  I bought (instead of renting)  the film in HD to watch on my Roku.  I don't have a Blue Ray player, nor do I intend to get one, but the video quality was fantastic, well worth the $13.",1364083200,2,1547,4.294117647058823
5319661,5,B009DA745M,"Unbelievable how many memories flood my mind after hearing/seeing this vid again.  I haven't watched the original since it came out!  Felt like it was only a few years ago instead of decades.  Props to all the guys, especially Rodney since I favor street.  Just imagine if he quit!?!?  Still motivates me now because it shows more than ever that it's the joy and creativity that matters.  I've been riding for 27 years and can still feel stoked being on a board!  The autobiography should be required viewing for the young rippers, it illustrates everything I try to convey to anyone new to the grind. Make your mark on the consciousness of culture... now go film it!",1363132800,,667,4.64957264957265
5319662,5,B009DA745M,The ideas are very well connected.  I feel that it gives a complete and accurate historical flow of events involving the skateboarding scene and how influential the bones brigade and Stacey Peralta's success in keeping this crew together.  The bones brigade and especially Rodney Mullen brought skateboarding to the era that we find skateboarding in.  They are the most influential skateboarders of all time and they deserve the respect and appreciation for the contribution and innovation and brilliance they brought to skateboarding.  Anyone who ever had anything to do with skateboarding needs to watch this video.,1362182400,4,617,5.395833333333333
5319663,5,B009DA745M,This movie is phenomenal. Peralta signs up an all-star talent list in the bones brigade. These guys are the very real deal and so is this doco!,1361923200,,143,4.333333333333333
5319664,5,B009DA745M,I am very nostalgic about this era of skateboarding and loved every minute of it.  Great documentary film with some very touching moments.  Very honest.,1360627200,,152,5.04
5319665,5,B009DA745M,This is a must watch for all who skated back in the glory days of skateboarding. It brings back so many memories and it makes you want to go back out there and start shreading!,1360195200,,176,4.057142857142857
5319666,5,B009DA745M,"... this movie spoke to me.  It was simply amazing, what a great great documentary.  It was something my son and I watched and now he wants to go skate.",1360108800,,152,4.033333333333333
5319667,5,B009DA745M,So great to see what went behind all the bones brigade videos and the personal lives of the skaters. I think everyone who skated grew up watching these videos. This also shows you how the Powell and Peralta team existed and grew. Awesome movie highly recommended.,1359936000,,263,4.739130434782608
5319688,5,B009DA745M,"This Bones Brigade Documentary proves to be a definitive study of the beginnings of skateboarding with great clips and interviews as well as a study of one of the greatest skateboarding teams ever assembled. Stacy Perralta was ingenious in hand picking this group of ""nobodies"" and transforming them into a well oiled and well known machine! Those who lived through this era and looked up to any or all of these guys will ""wax"" (pun intended) nostalgic as they listen to the Brigade's side to everything concerning them. I couldn't agree with the other reviewer more that this video is most woth watching simply for the genious that is Rodney Mullen. Not only was that guy ahead of his time and the king of progression when it came to trick, but through classical music and education he proved to be an assett to Earth through his words. He may have been a quiet soul in his youthful years, but he will make you quite happy that that had changed over time and as he got older.

The clips in this video are so awesome by not only showcasing some great videos that are dearly missed, but also giving the viewer clips of never before seen (by the general public) footage. The interviews, especially by Rodney prove fascinating. He is probably well aware of how much his skating is recognizeds and appreciated, but hopefully he knows how much his words are too. Rodney is not only eloquent, but also a deep thinker like a modern day philosopher proving to be the opposite of the skater stereotype.

The soundtrack feels both fun and appropriate reflecting the various styles of music and listening habits of skaters of that time period without detracting, but enhancing the words of those involved.

If you are a skater... especially from the early to mid 80s then I cannot push this documentary enough! Some great filmmaking by Perralta even if you're a fan of Sports Flicks you will enjoy this one.",1358467200,,1896,4.687687687687688
5319689,5,B009DA745M,"Tremendous. If you touched a board or bike in the 80s, this flick recalls that juvenile visceral pleasure of the ramps, pavement and trails. Equal parts nostalgia, artistry, commercialism and philosophy, the interviews translate that youthful enthusiasm into adult insights. Inspiring on so many levels.",1358121600,,303,5.7555555555555555
5319690,5,B009DA745M,"This video brings back so many memories of mine. We were just like these guys and as they grew in to professionals we followed them bought the movies and boards as well as tried to be like them skating, people call it ""Roll models"" lol good times! Love this movie!",1358035200,,264,4.3
5319691,5,B009DA745M,"these guys laid the sidewalk for modern street, and vert skating.all are still my idols today !!!!! and im 35",1357603200,,109,4.5
5319692,4,B009DA745M,"I am interested in Stacy Peralta's new documentary movie ""Bones Brigade: An Autobiography"" because about ten years ago I thoroughly enjoyed his film ""Dogtown and Z-Boys,"" a fascinating look at skateboarding movement in the 1970s. Now the director has made another intriguing documentary film about a skateboarding team ""Bones Brigade"" in the 1980s.

The film chronicles the history of the team that spans more than ten years, using interviews with the Bones Brigade members including Steve Caballero, Tommy Guerrero, Tony Hawk, Mike McGill, Lance Mountain and Rodney Mullen, as well as Stacy Peralta himself (hence, ""Autobiography"") and George Powell, former business partner of Peralta. The film also has archive footage of young Bones Brigade members showing their great moves at the competitions, and scenes from the hilarious video ""The Search for Animal Chin.""

I'm no skateboarder, but it is fun watching these young skateboarders doing amazing moves that are too quick for my eyes to follow. To me, however, the most impressive part of the film is the honest comments from the interviewees, now all middle-aged, looking back at their glory days when they were still teenagers, some troubled, all vulnerable. The emotions here are real and touching. The film is slightly overlong, but its message is a positive one. Worth a watch even if you know little about skateboarding.",1357603200,,1380,5.2681818181818185
5319693,5,B009DA745M,"The Powell Peralta guys have always been top notch athletes. This was way over due to celebrate the achievements and progression in the sport. Rodney Mullen does what he does in every video, he makes it great!",1357257600,,209,4.675675675675675
5319694,5,B009DA745M,Wow! Wow. Great stuff. Great coverage of a time that I lived on the edge of our society. It also covers just that process that skaters experience. I will be purchasing this one soon.,1357171200,,182,4.382352941176471
5319695,4,B009DA745M,"Very nostalgic, I was a child of the 80s. Killer skating, interesting perspectives on the background of beefs w BBrigade esp, between Hawk, Hosoi, Alva, etc. Def. worth watching whether you're old school/new school.",1356393600,,215,5.352941176470588
5319696,5,B009DA745M,You don't have to be or had been part of the skate scene to love this documentary. Many things to learn and to apply into your career and life.,1355616000,,143,3.9655172413793105
5319697,5,B009DA745M,"I was absolutely fascinated with the Bones Brigade\Powell Peralta scene growing up and to be honest that never left me. This is an incredibly unique crew from the extremely passionate and caring founder Stacy to the team of at the time no-names he hand picked with Tony, Steve, Lance, Mike, Tommy and Rodney who went on to become the best in the world (especially Tony and Rodney who were not only the best but the absolute innovators of tricks which are still hard for my mind to comprehend much less think about actually being able to do). Everything about what they did was cool, the boards, advertisement, the incredible artwork, even the corny Animal Chin video which I must have watched a thousand times. My parents did not really have the cash to spend on these things as a kid but managed to get me a Caballero deck one Christmas. It was so pretty I was afraid to scratch it and when I did it hurt. To fulfil some old childhood dreams I picked up a couple shirts a few months ago and have to say it felt good throwing them on. I learned a lot of unexpected things I did not know about them which made me like them even more. In an age where I basically detest virtually all manufactured celebrity types and scenes, from music, stars, etc... this was truly a refreshing time that captured a moment in the history of America that I truly miss but sadly know that raw freedom, optimism, and real entrepreneurism are long gone. These were\are good dudes who made the dream seem tangible. To qoute Hunter S. Thompson, to me this was the ""high-water mark--that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back"" the truly golden age of skating and so much more.",1354665600,12,1664,4.4950495049504955
8540233,5,B009DA745M,i remember looking forward to each issue of Thrasher magazine and being in awe of these guys!  They seemed a million miles away in California though.  I've been skating basically non stop for 37 years.  excellent video especially to see these guys when they were younger.. Still searching for Animal Chin.,1529625600,,305,4.9411764705882355
8540234,5,B009DA745M,"Great fun if you grew up/skated during this era. And after you finish, be sure to watch The Man Who Souled the World, which basically picks up where this one leaves off (you can find that one in its entirety on YouTube).",1525824000,,220,4.261904761904762

8540236,5,B009DA745M,"Awesome history of Bone Brigade. I used to like skating back in the mid-80's, can't say i skated much but I still enjoyed the scene. These names were well known to me. But being a young kid then, i didn't really know much of what was going on beyond my little world. Now, this serves as an awesome way to tell the back story of the 80's skate scene.

I especially liked Lance Mountain's take on drugs and alcohol.... very true.",1518566400,,427,4.271604938271605
8540237,5,B009DA745M,I was a skater in the 80s in Los Angeles and we would watch the Bones Brigade videos ALL THE TIME.  This movie was great to watch and brought back a lot of memories.  Even my wife who didn't skate enjoyed the movie.  5 stars!,1514851200,,225,3.9555555555555557

8540239,5,B009DA745M,"This is incredible! I lived in a small town in Idaho where mostly farm kids were. Me, my sister and a small group of other people skated. We must have watched Future Primitive 100,000 times. I remember the tape became worn out in some areas because we watched it so much.
The Bones Brigade were icons to us girls who skated. I remember visiting Denver one year and watching Mike McGill and Lance Mountain skate. For small town Idaho kids, it was surreal to watch these skateboarding gods in person.
To this day, I still have crazy respect for these guys. Watching this movie gives incredible insight to all of them as individuals.
If you skated in your youth, you will love this movie!",1511308800,,685,4.532258064516129
8540240,5,B009DA745M,"This was an amazing glimpse into the lives of the legendary Bones Brigade. Truly an eclectic group of young people who would go on to define skateboarding forever. The dynamics within this group as well as how the interviews are looped/presented really gives the viewer a feel of what the late 70s/early 80s skater scene was all about. Influential and inspiring, this documentary is an absolute must watch for any skateboarder or fan of the genre. Not to be missed! While it deep-dives into Mullen & Hawk it does not short-change anyone else in the main crew. Highly recommended!",1510272000,,579,4.858585858585859
