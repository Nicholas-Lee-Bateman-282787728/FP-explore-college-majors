4465505,5,B004TBKV1Y,"'Universal Squadrons' is a great movie and very energetic. the cast is superb! you have the great and wonderful also singers not just actors taking up the roles in the movie. {Christian Kane and Riley Smith} both are electrifying and awesome, can't help but to the love them both in their roles. good and bad what ever they both are wonderful!! superb movie and great actors!!!!",1324252800,4,378,4.742424242424242
4465506,1,B004TBKV1Y,"The low budget isn't an issue; I took the movie seriously.  Some of the effects are kind of cool and well done actually.  However, I just wasn't compelled.  Some of the story didn't hold together.  Awkward changes of pace and style, from overly romantic scenes to video game violence.  The main character and his girlfriend were good looking, Caucasian, blond, and living a romantic, sun soaked pastoral life with big diamond rings (but their property was in foreclosure?).  Felt unrealistic, like an Abercrombie and Fitch ad, which was out of place, and not good for creating realistic characters with any depth that you want to relate to or have sympathy for.

When it came, the ending was so blas that I didn't even know it was in progress, and I was left with a Cheeto hanging out of my mouth saying ""what the heck just happened?!!""  It also didn't explain about half of the interesting parts of the movie that took so long to develop!

The appearance of Christian Kane was weird.  He's a semi-celebrity from Leverage with a large female following.  Seemed like he was thrown into the mix to give the movie more popular appeal.  This kind of detracted from the honesty of this indie film for me.

Um, Jacob's Ladder?  (Spoiler alert) The psychology of a returning soldier with nightmarish flashbacks from government-sponsored drug-induced violence?  Hmm.  See any striking similarities between the two?  Only in that movie the main character was a nerdy postal guy you could feel bad for.  Oh well.  Check out Primer or Pi for unpretentious, indie psychological sci-fi films about the mind and science (each made for less than this movie I would guess).  Paranormal Activity isn't so bad either.",1315872000,2,1699,4.853658536585366
4465507,3,B004TBKV1Y,"This movie was better than I anticipated for an indy film. Cover looked like kid's video game. Was surprised by acting and drama in the film about vet with self esteem/money/love issues.  Some echoes of ""Twilight"" with the speed and strength of a few of the characters, but not too sci fi-ish. More a conspiracy thriller with romantic overtones.",1311638400,3,345,4.8474576271186445
4465508,5,B004TBKV1Y,"Universal Squadrons, formerly known as Minuteman, is much more than a war movie...although war is an important element in the story, the movie is told on a human scale and is more of a sci-fi thriller in my opinion.  Worth a watch if you are a fan of Riley Smith, Christian Kane (Leverage), Barry Corbin or Willa Ford, or just looking to be entertained with a well done thriller...Marshall Teague, Stacy Cunningham & Bryan Massey are standouts among a strong supporting cast and the music, both live (John David Kent & The Dumb Angels) and the Blackland Records score are top notch.  I may be a bit biased and am certainly a hometown advocate for the North Texas film and music industry, but watching this film recently on the HDTV increases my anticipation for future Dreamfly Productions projects.

Also includes 2 bonus music videos and you can stick a CD in your cart when you buy on Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-David-Kent/dp/B0056C6P74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John David Kent</a>",1310083200,8,1047,5.411042944785276
4465509,5,B004TBKV1Y,"I thoroughly enjoyed this sci-fi thriller.  It kept me on the edge of my seat with adventure, action and suspense.  I couldn't have predicted the end...which made the journey worthwhile.  I loved the bits of humor with Barry Corbin, and I enjoyed the terrific cast...along with the romance between Lance and his girl (Willa Ford).  I also enjoyed the interface with the video game...which made me feel as if I was inside Lance's head.  I could empathize with his character and thought the military theme was timely and relevant.  This film is entertaining and thought-provoking, and I look forward to seeing it again...to uncover pieces I may have missed the first time.",1309910400,7,670,4.9375
4465510,5,B004TBKV1Y,"Low budget?  sure. But this isn't meant to be Star Wars....it's a fun ride, an independent sci fi film that takes on boundaries between reality and imagination, humanity and technology. Well paced, relevant, and an interesting commentary on post traumatic stress. Definitely check it out.",1309219200,7,288,5.4
4465511,1,B004TBKV1Y,"Lance (Riley Smith) is playing a video game called ""Minuteman"" with 3 fellow soldiers. The game is similar to ""Doom."" When Lance frags his buddies in the game, they die in their chairs. He returns home to his ranch, girlfriend (Willa Ford) and unemotional father who is in a wheel chair. He discovers his ranch has been run into the ground and the bank is ready to foreclose. Meanwhile, he has flashbacks to various aspects of the game and Iraq.

When a ranch hand (David Born) gets his hand caught, Lance runs at super-human speed to save him. He doesn't remember how he moved that fast. During this early scene we discover two things: 1) someone is watching him and 2) the special effects are about the same as the ""6 Million Dollar Man"" and we don't get the cool background bionic noise to go with the motions.

Lance ""zones out"" and goes into rages, like the Hulk, with severe anger management issues.

The plot is weak. Low budget, not worth the view.

F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1308700800,,983,4.50561797752809

8440587,3,B004TBKV1Y,"This is definitely in the ""killer b"" section of the movie universe.  Partway through I started wondering what alternate name it could have [besides Minutemen] and came up with ""Jason Bourne's Dumber Brother"".  [For anyone who doesn't get it, that is also a nod to the under appreciated ""Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother""]  Yes it does have a few things to like, but it was mostly so formula and so slow-paced that, like a Minuteman in a moment of adrenaline, I found I had to fast-forward about 50% of the film to stay interested in those rare moments when something actually happened.
Seemed like an anti-war, anti-government sort of sci-fi/action story.  Or was it pro-war, anti-government?  Was it pro-war, pro-secret government?  I donno, I think they injected me with some kind of drug in my jugular, and I'm not exactly sure now.

Always interesting when one of the bad guys is one of the most interesting characters in a movie [And also had the best line: ""Next time you get religion, don't do it on MY watch""].  Despite having previewed the best line, the character is pretty good to watch.  And what voice did the main character remind me of?  That took a while too then I realized: Jay, of Jay & Silent Bob!

The story certainly allows room for a sequel---if sales allow for a sequel.  Next time it could do well with an INTERESTING, non-generic lead female role and a little less down time...",1462233600,,1403,4.681632653061224
