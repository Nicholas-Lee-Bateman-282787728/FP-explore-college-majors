7861055,5,6304091214,To the employee of Amazon who reads this post. Please have this movie turned into a DVD I have always loved the acting of Max Pomeranc. This film is a TV movie and was released in 1995. It has been a long time since I have seen this movie. A little boy called Journey is turned over to his grandfather to raise. That is the gist of what the movie is about. If put into video streaming or made into a DVD I would gladly buy it and watch it again.,1484438400,,445,3.901098901098901

7861058,5,6304091214,"Jason Robards was quite a gem.  They don't make actors like that anymore.  The move captures love and loss, and the angst of relationships that we all feel from time to time.  Life doesn't have to be perfect, but it can be GOOD ENOUGH.  Great lessons from this film.  There should be more family films these days.  Our TV and movie screens are too filled with violence and vulgarity.",1154304000,13,383,4.478260869565218
