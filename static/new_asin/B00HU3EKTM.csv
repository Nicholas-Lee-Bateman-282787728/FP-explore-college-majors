8635749,5,B00HU3EKTM,"My Daughter LOVES this movie! She enjoys Lalaloopsy but this is her favorite. She was badly sick for a week almost a year ago and the only thing that would help calm her and make her feel better was this movie. We were watching it with her several times a day. After that she went about 6 months without wanting to see it but she has picked it back up again.

I love how polite everyone is and how this movie models friendship and teamwork. It also has a cute little song at the end of the movie which my daughter is obsessed with. She sings it in the bathtub, in the car, on the swingset...

The plot is pretty much the same as in the product description. The ponies and dolls work together to help the ponies put on a show for a competition. They show hospitality to the ponies and also friendship and teamwork.",1424217600,,813,4.205128205128205
