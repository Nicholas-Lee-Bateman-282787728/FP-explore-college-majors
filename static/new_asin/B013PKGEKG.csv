7370382,5,B013PKGEKG,"I LOVE the FXP Hoop and DVDs! As a group fitness instructor and women's wellness educator, I am always on the lookout for fun, safe and effective exercises for my participants. I found FXP Hoop Fitness almost 2 years ago and after trying it out myself, I was sold! The Hoop is well made and can break down into sections to transport in the convenient travel bag. The DVDs are fun and I can choose from a quick 15 minute routine to a longer routine depending on my available time. LOVE it!",1450915200,4,488,4.315217391304348
7370383,5,B013PKGEKG,The FXP Hula Hoop and DVDs are amazing! The hoop puts the FUN back in fitness and gives you permission to play while you work out. The 2 lb. weighted hoop is easily collapsible and fits beautifully in a little bag. You can also download an awesome app from FXP to take anywhere. Love it...just buy it!,1449014400,,301,4.298245614035087
7370384,5,B013PKGEKG,"I have been using this system for about 9 months (2x's+ a week)  and it still amazes me how great a workout I get.  Time flies and I am having fun the entire time!  High quality hoop and love that I can bring it anywhere I go. It breaks down easily, weighs 2 lbs so I can even travel with it!",1448755200,5,292,3.7540983606557377
7370385,5,B013PKGEKG,"Everything you need to start hooping at home or when traveling! Easy to put together and take apart. Love the instructional DVD.
A fun way to exercise!",1448755200,4,151,4.62962962962963
7370386,5,B013PKGEKG,"This is the best hoop fitness program available  !
 The hoop is easy to use and is portable to carry any were.  The DVD is great and gives good instructions.
 It is an excellent choice!",1448755200,5,185,4.2
7370387,5,B013PKGEKG,So great! it comes apart so easily and amazing that i could actually hula hoop with it. the workouts are great and it was fun and i couldn't believe how much it made me sweat!,1444608000,3,175,4.0285714285714285
7370388,5,B013PKGEKG,Convenient and portable. Light weight.,1466121600,,38,6.8
7370389,5,B013PKGEKG,"OMG! I love this thing!
Not at first though... I got it out of the box, put it together, tried to hula with it. No success, AND it kinda hurt when it got down to my shins and rolled around. So I put it away. A few weeks later I got it back out, got out the video and went to work. Some of the video segments are really just using the hoop for resistance/tension, kind of a yoga/pilates thing which she states in the video. Then, determined to figure out the hula-ing thing I tried it again. WOW! I'm not a young person, and I have nerve damage in my leg and foot, things don't work like they used to. But it really didn't take me long to get the hang of it the second time out. I love hula-ing every morning!",1462924800,4,708,3.958041958041958
7370390,5,B013PKGEKG,"This is fun, effective and convenient...and is sure to bring back memories of your childhood for anyone who grew up in the 70s when hula hooping was popular!

Contents:  6 piece hula hoop, carrying bag (measures 23.5 inches when holding pieces), DVD (Fit in 15) and poster of exercises
Quality:  solid plastic that looks like it will last for years; no cushioning that can fall apart
Portability: lightweight and assembles/disassembles with ease, stores in carrying bag
Effective:  easily feel your core working to burn calories as you learn to move with the hoop
Comfort:  takes some getting used to (not super soft, but also did not cause bruising, as some claim) - just build up slowly
Fun Factor:  super fun and challenging, but with the weighted plastic it is SO much easier to keep it going than the lightweight hoops
Shipment:  this arrived only in the product box - meaning there was no Amazon brown box protecting the product - they just put the shipping label directly on the hoop box and sent it.  I read afterwards that you can ask for a Amazon box to cover it, but I didn't see that at the time I placed my order.

I love the portability of this hoop, but I thought I could fit it in my carry-on bag when traveling and it's a tad bit too long to fit in my suitcase (see attached photo), which is the standard carry-on size.  I probably could have carried it separately and put it under the seat, but I already had another smaller bag and you know how the airlines really limit you these days!  This hoop does not have any cushioning whatsoever, but it still feels good because of the solid weight in the hoop.  I previously had a hoop that had cushioning and made the mistake of leaving it out on my patio - it rained and ruined the cushioning so I wanted to order another hoop that wasn't so sensitive to the elements.

I'm just doing it slowly to start - a few minutes a day.  I haven't seen bruises as other mention, but I do feel the burn in my core!  For some folks who have fragile systems or who tend to bruise super easily, it might be too much - but for strong folks looking to burn some calories and have some fun (especially as hooping brings back childhood memories), I highly recommend it.  And if you haven't hooped since your childhood, I highly recommend watching YouTube videos to learn the tricks of doing it correctly to keep the hoop from falling - don't give up if it takes you a bit to get it going.  I haven't used the video of exercises that came with the hoop yet, but am glad they added one so I can try using my hoop in a variety of ways.

Also, the box the hoop arrived in showed there was supposed to be an exercise mat included - mine didn't come with one.  When I asked Amazon about this they gave me the option of returning the package and getting a new one or taking a partial refund for the missing item.  I opted for the partial refund since I was already using and enjoying my hoop.  I was very satisfied with their options - great, fast and effective customer service!",1462320000,4,3018,4.353571428571429
7370391,1,B013PKGEKG,"I really wanted to like this but it really hurts my sides because of how hard the plastic is. This really is due to the plastic and not sure anything can be done. Maybe they can offer a foam slip sleeve for it to take the edge off. Literally! I only used it a couple times and prefer cardio kickboxing or Windsor Pilates instead. My pains are good from exercise not from bruising with this hoop. It literally feels like internal bruising. I'm well familiar with hooping as I was the one kid in P.E. Class who hooped the longest time. Was excited to start hooping again, but think I will buy original non-weighted hoop instead. Months later I'm still in pain on my right side. Wish I could return it, but can't.",1458259200,,710,4.345864661654136
7370392,5,B013PKGEKG,Omg. I originally bought a 4 lb sport hoop from another seller and it was horrible. Extreme bruising and not easy to use the hoop. I returned that and another person recommended I get the fxp hoop. Best decision ever. Does not cause bruising. Fun to use. I am a beginner. I could never hula hoop until I got this hoop!,1457308800,3,318,4.229508196721311
7370393,2,B013PKGEKG,Pretty boring workouts if you could call them that.  Would only suit a completely inactive person or a senior looking for gentle exercise. Very very gentle exercise.,1455926400,,165,5.111111111111111
7370394,5,B013PKGEKG,"To echo many others....IT'S FUN! But let's not confuse ""fun"" with easy. Nelly bar the door, it's a challenge & within 5 minutes I was dripping sweat. First workout found me blurting out explatives as the hoop kept hitting the floor.

Just ""hooping"" is a challenge, but you want me to switch positions? Swap my lead leg? Move my arms? (Seriously?) *More blurting*
Second workout was already showing great improvement with my coordination & the DVD is a great asset.

The instructor is fabulous. She's professional, encouraging & appropriately dressed. (I'm no prude, but some of these exercise DVD ""instructors"" are flat trampy.) Her cueing in a pleasant voice is impeccable & there's plenty to do in addition to the actual ""hooping"". Her extensive background, including pilates, is obvious in the toning segments.

Hoop is high quality & lightly weighted, easy to assemble, has a carrying bag & the guided dvd workout is awesome. (There's a printed flyer/handout that illustrates the moves as well.)

I'm sore. Seriously. You'll use your body (mostly core, but legs too) in new & interesting ways.

For the cost, this is a fantastic program.",1454025600,5,1141,5.015873015873016
7370395,5,B013PKGEKG,This is awesome!! Such a fun workout! I love that your workout can be brief or as long as you want. It's great because after a long day at the work it's hard to leave my dog again to go to the gym and this way I can stay home. The hoop is amazing the way it can be taken apart and stored. But stays together with no problems during use. Get it!,1453766400,2,344,3.7260273972602738
7370396,3,B013PKGEKG,"Guess I'm too old to hoola hoop anymore! Had to send it back. Doesn't mean you can't do it, though.",1453680000,,99,4.0
7370397,5,B013PKGEKG,This is the best 0 impact workout that ANYONE can do!! I love it and am having amazing results!!!  I am officially a hoopaholic and they are great with customer service!!,1451520000,,170,4.483870967741935
8728428,4,B013PKGEKG,Easy to assemble and good video. I gave it four stars because one area on the hoop tends to poke out a little and rubs on my waist. It is somewhat annoying but hasn't stopped me from using it.,1513987200,,192,3.948717948717949
8728429,5,B013PKGEKG,Great exercise tool. Easy to put together.,1509580800,,42,5.142857142857143
8728430,4,B013PKGEKG,"Wanted to reduce a bit of a spare tire and was always envious of those 'hoop girls' at outside events.  First.....very frustrating when I realized that I can't hula-hoop.  I got an additional video (Hoopdance Workout) which gave good tips and after a few weeks of trying it sporadically, I'm still terrible but can get it going for a little while.  Great exercise.  This WILL bruise you at first (if you can't hoop), it's not a child's hoop.  After a week or two, no more bruising and hopefully, firming up a bit.",1477008000,,513,4.532608695652174
8728431,5,B013PKGEKG,This hula hoop is not to heavy and is a great workout. Might take a little practice but you will get it. Nice that it comes apart for traveling.,1476403200,,144,4.0
8728432,5,B013PKGEKG,I have several fitness hoops and this one is my new favorite It was easy to put together. Love that it came with a carry bag and not straps. The video also provides a great workout that combines using the hoop and aerobic fitness. It is challenging and definitely got me sweating. For more fitness ideas and tips and tricks check out Youtube as well.,1474848000,,350,4.4
8728433,3,B013PKGEKG,"I give a 3 star because i would prefer a weighted, foam padded portable one. But other than that, it works.",1471910400,,107,4.142857142857143
8728434,4,B013PKGEKG,I LOVE that this hula hoop folds! And the workout video is fun!,1471824000,,63,3.923076923076923
8728435,5,B013PKGEKG,"Just arrived today and works well--nice hoop and bag, tiny mat and DVD are great too.  Happy with my purchase!",1469577600,,110,4.5
8728436,5,B013PKGEKG,This is honestly the most fun workout I have done! It doesn't even feel like working out.,1467417600,2,89,4.294117647058823
8728437,5,B013PKGEKG,"This hoop isn't heavy, and it doesn't leave bruises. I like the design of the snap together pieces, they are very sturdy and do not come loose at all. I use this one only for when I am inside and watching tv (during commercial breaks), or listening to music. The carry bag is great, but the ""mat"" this hoop comes with is a tiny square about 5"" x 5"". I never use the mat, but if you want a hoop that's fun, not too heavy, and easy to transport, I highly recommend this one!",1467158400,,472,4.031914893617022
