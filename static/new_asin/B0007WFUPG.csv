8052581,4,B0007WFUPG,"I show this video for my High School U.S. History class (Juniors) and they give it good reviews every year.  (Can we watch it again?? That is HIGH praise coming from a teenager)
The narrator keeps things moving.  The experts interviewed are knowledgeable and interesting.
One comes away with a feeling of wanting to hear more.  They could probably make this a 2 hour presentation if they wanted to do so.
After viewing this, you come away knowing who Al Capone is.  In all, I recommend this video with four stars.",1234310400,9,513,4.604395604395604
