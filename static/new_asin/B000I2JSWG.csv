8143488,5,B000I2JSWG,"Shirou lost his parents in a great fire 10 years ago and was adopted by the Kiritsugu family. His adopted Father is now dead and he lives by himself. Shirou possesses a magic ability to see the structural makeup of any object. He has never realized what he has this ability for. One day at school after hours, he witnesses a duel between 2 spirits. One of them attacks him and he is about to be killed. Just before the final blow is delivered, a blonde girl in armor and wielding an invisible sword saves him and tells him that he is her master.

Shirou learns that he is now a Magi. Magi are 7 magicians that summon spirit warriors from history to fight in  the war for the Holy Grail. Whichever duo wins, gets to make a wish on the Grail and have it come true.

I was very surprised by this anime. It has great animation, voice acting, and a cool plot. There are also interesting characters, tons of action, comedy and drama. It's pretty loaded. I like this volume very much, and I'm looking forward to watching the next.",1354665600,2,1023,4.317708333333333
8143489,5,B000I2JSWG,"I would consider this anime one of the best ones out there. I watched the whole thing prior to purchasing the DVD's and wanted a set for myself to have in my library.

The storyline was excellent, the characters were unforgettable, and the animation, to me, was top-notch.",1207353600,2,272,4.666666666666667
8143490,5,B000I2JSWG,"I discovered Fate/Stay Night through the original visual novel, and ero-game by the same title. The anime traces the Saber-focused romance path with omission of the sex scenes and such. Since the anime is based on a game/novel, there's a lot of things that a casual veiwer of the anime series will miss or simply not get off hand without investigation into the series. However, the anime can stand on it's own without the veiwer understanding the ins and outs of what's going on elsewhere.

*cough* Anyway...

The animation is solid, the music is solid, and the Japanese voice acting is very good as is the translation. The english voice acting, so far, seems weak though... Especially where Sakura and Taiga are concerned.

Overall, it's a series for fans of Typemoon's works. I happily recommend it.",1169769600,6,801,4.875
8143491,5,B000I2JSWG,"My daughter received the dvd for Christmas.  She said it was a 12 on a one through ten scale. She is a big fan of japamation, both movies and books so I accept her opinion as authoratative.  She is in the eighth grade after all.

She also says the next installment is due in February, that she wants it and that it should be cheaper as the first volume had the box etc.",1169164800,8,369,4.027397260273973
8143492,4,B000I2JSWG,"16 year old high school student Shirou was raised by a powerful mystic after being found in the ruins of burned up section of Fuyuki City after the death of his parents. Shirou learned a bit of magic from his adopted dad but not much. His sole remnant of those teachings is the ability to touch objects and figure out what is wrong with them. Doesn't really bode well for a large place in the world, does it? Things are pretty normal with him until he witnesses a battle between two supernatural warriors after school. One of the figures appears to be controlled by one of his classmates, the beautiful Rin. Rin is involved in a tournament like affair called the ""Holy Grail Wars"" between seven ""Masters"" and ""Servants"". Masters are chosen by the Holy Grail (yes, THE Holy Grail) every couple of decades to fight for mastery of its power, which can grant any wish. The Servants are the spiritual embodiments of great warriors from history that are used as the champions of the Masters. Whichever Master is left standing at the end of the game gains control of the Holy Grail. Unfortunately for Shirou, he's a marked man because any witnesses to the War must be killed immediately!

Fate Stay Night really had to work on me to differentiate itself from many other anime of its ilk. It brought Angelic Layer to mind and a bit of Steel Angel Kurumi, especially when Shirou's Servant, called Saber, appears dressed as an armored maid. But the great thing about Shirou's and Saber's relationship is that it isn't as wishy washy as is usual in the genre of wimpy nerd meets powerful female robot or warrior. Saber is hard-edged and thinks Shirou sees her merely as a tool but she quickly realizes that he is something completely different than the typical Master, especially since he has no clue as to what is going on. I'm eager to see how their relationship is going to evolve. The animation and voice acting is awesome on this first volume and really goes a ton of the way to redeeming the subpar story. I mean, if the Holy Grail holds the blood of Christ, would Jesus really compel people to have violent fights, sometimes to the death, to wield its power? That's where the story trips a bit, in the reason that the Holy Grail makes people fight. Doesn't it go against everything Christian to see might as right? Of course, the Japanese do not view our religion with a religious eye, but more of a secular one, so the creators simply saw the Holy Grail as a mystical gimmick that sounded cool. If you can look over the religious inconsistencies, this is an average show with above average talent.",1167782400,4,2594,4.578494623655914
8143493,5,B000I2JSWG,"Since I am personally somewhat of a TYPE-MOON fan (company that is responsible for producing the Fate/Stay Night PC game this anime is based on) I give this show a 5-star rating, something I rarely give out. I'm not a total TYPE-MOON fanatic though, I haven't played either of their PC games Fate/Stay Night or Tsukihime since I can't read Japanese and/or can't find the games. So I think most people will enjoy this show whether they already knew about it or not. I've only seen this disc with the first 4 episodes on it (out of 24) not the whole series, so that is what this review will be based on.

Story-wise I say Fate/Stay Night gets a 5 out of 5. It's not a perfect 5, and it's not some all-time classic, but it's quite interesting and will almost certainly continue developing in the same intruiging fashion that TYPE-MOON has become famous for. Directing is probably the weakest area of this show, I'd give it 3 or 4 stars. It's still fairly good, but the thing that annoys me the most is how everything gets silly the moment that girl with short brown hair appears. I forgot her name, and while she gets her share of screen time I don't think she is an important character in regards to the fights and main plot. I wish she didn't exist, I blame her whenever the atmosphere changes into silliness. The rest of the time Fate/Stay Night is moderately serious and fits the tone I prefer for these types of shows.

Drawing style I give a high 5 out of 5. As I've seen a number of others say, Rin Tohsaka is one of the best character designs ever. Drawing consistency I can't yet comment on as I've only seen 4 episodes, not enough to see how badly the drawings may degenerate in the bad episodes. So far the consistency has been pretty good but I saw some ugly things in the episode five preview. Animation quality is a low 5 stars. For those who saw the Fate/Stay Night trailer (found on some other Geneon DVDs), the general animation quality of the show itself is not quite up to the level of the fights shown in the trailer. But it's not that much worse. There's pretty much no sign of frame-saving efforts ever, it's just not ultra spectacular at all times like the fights in the trailer were. Background drawings are 4 stars, quite nice but not the best I've ever seen. Music is 4 stars, done by well-known anime composer Kenji Kawai, but only a few songs are really memorable. It's inevitable I think when the same composers are over-utilized, they can't produce that many good songs for each show they do. I agree with the previous review that the intro and ending songs aren't that good. They are not composed by Kenji Kawai, only the BGM which is better is by him.

In terms of the genre this show is in, Fate/Stay Night is kind of unique. It's a blend of the fighting/action genre together with the dating sim genre, which is the trademark of TYPE-MOON productions. And I think this is a good enough show to appeal to fans of both genres. It also has an interesting historical feel, as most of the combatants in this show are historical figures from ancient mythology, such as Hercules, Medusa, Sasaki Kojiro, etc. Or so I hear, in the first 4 episodes so far only a couple identities were revealed. Some people might get mad when they find out who Saber is supposed to be. Ha ha ha. I don't know when that gets revealed though.

Lastly, a review of the DVD disc itself, not the show. This is the sloppiest Geneon release I've seen in some time. The menus suck and are totally barren of anything interesting. Most of them are silent with no music. The in-show translations are also unusually bad, filled with numerous typos and grammatical errors, occasionally bordering into ""Engrish"". In general the translations are done well and are very understandable, but I guess they forgot to proofread. There are essentially no extras and the trailers are old rehashed stuff. One good thing, the dub is quite well done, so I advise watching the dub as well as the sub, as some of the translations are handled better in it.

Regarding the contents of the boxset, it's just a box with nothing extra inside, unfortunately. Also, a huge warning. There are also two very slight variants of print-tones that the boxes come in, a lighter-colored box and a darker, purpler-colored box. Most of the lighter-tone boxes have something rattling around inside of them, while the darker-tone boxes don't. That sound is the DVD disc loose inside, rolling around and being scratched up. I have heard about 10 of these boxes already. I've seen around 25 Fate boxes in total. The same stores generally carry both print tones too, the batches were mixed. So be aware that anywhere from 30% to 50% of all Fate/Stay Night boxsets have a loose DVD inside, which is very unfortunate. I advise buying the boxset in person rather than online, so that you can exchange the disc if you have to.",1166659200,9,4877,4.5375
8143494,5,B000I2JSWG,"I'm being fairly generous with the 5th star since I've only watched the first 4 episodes that come on this, but I think it can live up to it.

The DVD released here by Geneon has to get a 2 at best, though.  The only extras are a pathetic set of pencil sketches, opening and closing credits, and three previews.  I don't think it's unreasonable to expect more when they charge $30 for something like that.  The series box comes with it.  So if you decide to buy all the DVDs, this purchase will give you a nice box to store them in.  That big thing next to the first DVD is just a filler.  Nothing special about it once you've inspected it.

On to the anime.  The show didn't really impress me very much until about halfway through episode 2.  The story centers around a boy, Shirou, who has a hazy past.  He has the unusual habit of wanting to help people, which has believable roots in his past.  It isn't entirely clear yet, but he appears to have a connection with a war that had been fought ten years prior to the story.  This introduces the main plot: a war fought between teams of masters, such as Shirou, and their servants, heroic spirits from the past.  Their goal is to obtain the Holy Grail and be granted a wish.  Forget your traditional knowledge of the Grail story.  This anime puts a more sinister twist to it, which isn't bad at all so far.

The animation quality is the strongest point so far.  (The story is progressively growing on me, but I have to wait until the end to give it's full evaluation).  I don't have another anime to compare it to.  I'd have say it's a step above even animes like Fullmetal Alchemist.  The music is fine.  I don't think the intro and closing music stand out very much, though.  If you browse online, you can find a Japanese opening that sounds much better and was what first drew me to the series.

Overall some of the dialouge could have been better executed, and the comic relief doesn't add that much to it yet.  Both the story and dialouge improve though, and you can see the beginnings of a great bond forming between Shirou and his servant, Saber.  Going by episode 4's ending, I'd say the next installment will be even better.  It won't all get released until October, 2007, though.

I would definitely give this one a shot if you've got the cash to spare.  This is the first anime of this type to make its way onto my shelf, and I think I made the right choice in choosing this one.",1166659200,7,2441,4.303296703296703
