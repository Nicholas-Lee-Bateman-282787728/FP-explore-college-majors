7831705,4,6302795400,"Belgian-born Agns Varda (b. 1928) has been one of my favorite filmmakers for years, and I've been trying to track down as many of her elusive films as possible.  Varda never achieved even the modest level of fame that her late husband Jacques Demy (of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Umbrellas-of-Cherbourg/dp/B0001BMLUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</a>&nbsp;among others) did, nor has she achieved the level of critical recognition of some of her other contemporaries like Jean-Luc Godard and Franois Truffaut.  But Varda, like the other ""Left Bank"" or ""Rive Gauche"" filmmakers with which she is sometimes grouped, including Chris Marker and Alain Resnais, has built up a steady, uncompromising career fixated on a strong moral compass - in her case, on the struggles of women and the poor in the world of men and wealth.

She has gained a bit more attention in the last few years, remaining quite productive into her 80s with a series of documentaries and essay-films exploring the plight of the imporverished in France, and her own career and her life with her late husband; and her early features, from LA POINTE COURTE (1956) through LE BONHEUR (1965) continue to gain more recognition and respect; but the middle part of her career, from 1966-1984 or so, remains a blank spot for all but the most committed partisans, mostly occupied by political documentaries and barely-seen and hardly-released features.  This film, from 1977, is the most well-known, and it's not been put on DVD in the USA yet.

I guess for me it comes as a bit of a disappointment.  Not knowing Varda's other works from this period - and knowing that her cinema, more than most, is one that tends to progress from point to point - I wonder if I'm missing something.  It starts out promisingly enough, showing the chance meeting of two school friends, 17-year-old Pauline (Valrie Mairesse) and 22-year-old Suzanne (Thrse Liotard) in Paris in 1962.  Suzanne is carrying on an affair with a married photographer with whom she already has two kids - and is pregnant with a third.  She wants to abort the child - illegal in France at the time - and Pauline, still at home with her strict parents, impulsively decides to help her.  Their paths soon diverge, but a bond is formed, never to be forgotten.

The rest of the film charts the roads the two women travel over the next 14 years, with Suzanne staying a single mother, living with her parents in the south of France at first, and eventually opening a women's clinic, while Pauline becomes a politically active singer and eventually falls in love with an Iranian man, Darius (Ali Raffi).  There are several songs interspersed through the film, though not enough that it's fair to call it a ""musical"", and they certainly help to put the story firmly into the milieu of its' politically-charged and (for a time) hopeful era.  At times the politics and the feminist rage of the piece threaten to overwhelm the rather thin storyline, which really doesn't build up to anything much more than ""men shouldn't have so much power, women should have more control over their lives"".  A wonderful sentiment - but not all that compelling in this form.

Still, the two leads are both excellent, warm and very real, and the character of Darius - who at one point Pauline accuses of just wanting to go back to his traditionalist culture and betraying all the feminist and progressive ideals he'd shown in France - ends up becoming a much more well-rounded and sympathetic character than any of the other men in the film, which certainly helps to keep things from seeming too shrill and strident.  The photography by Charles Van Damme is lovely - or seems like it is, as it's hard to tell with this grainy panned-and-scanned VHS - capturing the wintry sunlight in many scenes that Varda seems to love especially well.  The director narrates this version in her accented but perfectly respectable English; I'm not sure this was needed and should the film be released on DVD I'd hope there'd be an option to remove it, as it seems to dumb the film down a little bit.

I don't mean to overstate the problems and caveats I have here; though this is far from my favorite of the director's films, it's certainly worth a look and probably even worth buying a used VHS of, if you're already a fan.  If not, I would certainly recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4-by-Agns-Varda-La-Pointe-Courte-Clo-from-5-to-7-Le-bonheur-Vagabond-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000XQ4HQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4 by Agns Varda (La Pointe Courte, Clo from 5 to 7, Le bonheur, Vagabond) -  (The Criterion Collection)</a>&nbsp;as a first step in exploring this great filmmaker's world.",1285113600,2,4790,5.164082687338501
7831706,5,6302795400,"This is a love story about two women who are of very similar minds, but different temperaments. The love is a deep and enduring friendship that sees both women through difficult times.
Ironically, the two women don't see much of each other; they sustain their relationship through letters and postcards, read in the woman's voices, as we watch them take their separate paths, mostly succeeding, but sometimes meeting heartbreak and loss. At different times, and for different reasons, they marry, and become mothers, all exquisitely played out with passion and poignancy by the lead actresses.
The backdrop of the film is the beginning of the Second Wave of feminism. Both of the women are committed to the rights of women, and both enter careers which pursue this cause, but in such different ways as reflect their temperaments.
The film is beautiful to watch. The colors of the film are both vibrant and subdued, which has an hypnotic effect on the viewer; you cannot take your eyes from the screen, and it all seems so real, you are on the edge of your seat each time one of the women opens a letter; you ache for the times the can be together, and feel joy each time they are able to embrace.
Without special effects, unusual plot twists, or anything that requires the audience to suspend disbelief beyond reason, this film is startling original. For that alone it is worth seeing. And if you see it, you will never forget it.",1006992000,7,1430,4.724
