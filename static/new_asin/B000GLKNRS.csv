2614988,5,B000GLKNRS,"This is the complete season 1 and 2 of Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet. Well done Gerry. Very enjoyable. Leaves you wanting more. Great character development and story depth. Great attention to detail. Great CGI.
Takes a while to warm to the new voices. But rewarding once you get there. Addictive entertainment.",1307318400,4,317,5.115384615384615
2614989,4,B000GLKNRS,"I've always been a fan of the Andersons' somewhat kitschy but cool puppet Sci-Fi.  Most of it is because of the sheer artistry that went into their now-legendary shows.  My favorite? Captain Scarlet.  The classic from 1966-67 was a neat idea when it was first concieved.  Despite limitations, it was a super-cool show.
In 2005, Scarlet was the perfect candidate for a revival, and he got a fantastic one--no strings attatched.  CGI animation (which is quite high quality for television) did the good Captain justice, and some of the stories were penned by Phil Ford (who also worked on DOCTOR WHO).  Due to expense and the material not being suitable for the youngest set (it is quite violent!), there were only two series made.  The story is quite unresolved at the end.  Still-- NCS breathes new life into a classic, and Scarlet translates amazingly well for a modern audience.  S.I.G!",1305504000,7,887,4.86
8133380,5,B000GLKNRS,"I was a fan of the original series ... yeah the puppets . The CGI series gives a much needed reboot and it delivered it! I hope that other programs they had done in the past might get the Captain Scarlet and even the Thunderbirds CGI treatment or even live action adaptations<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Captain-Scarlet-Series-One-Two-Region-2/dp/B0031BAR80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Captain Scarlet: Series One & Two [Region 2</a>] !",1522022400,,484,6.578125
8133381,1,B000GLKNRS,"Once I got past the thrilling graphics, this series got old fast. Its boring, repettive, and soul-less. It has no spirit, no central theme, and nothing relatable driving the non-existent plot-line.

See, theres this trillion dollar station floating in the clouds, and its got this colonel, and these crack chick Agels pilots, and these captains named after colors and what they do is...wait...I have no idea what they do or what their mission is or who ostensibly pays for all that hardwarethe station, jets, rino trucks, installations all over the world, superceding authority on EVERYthing, etc.

Heres a typical day: the eveeel turncoat Mysteron, Catain Black, perpetrates an evil obscure scheme. Captain Scarlet battles heroically but is foiled or killed (but hes indestructible, see, and always regenerates later). Then Angels launch in their spiffy jets, do nothing except fly around and maybe fire off some weapons, get the mission called off, return to base, sit around in their super-tight onesies, and Captain Black gets foiled andwellgame over.

I still cant figure out who these people are and what they are doing with all that equipment andwellstuff.

Oh...if these Angel girls were real, in real life, they would make every red-blooded male break down and cry that he can never have one to play with.",1515369600,,1314,5.126168224299065

8133385,5,B000GLKNRS,"Saw this on DISH back in '05, Waited, and waited for it to come out on DVD in U. S. but no dice. You will need a unit that plays Region 2 PAL, but it is worth the effort. Darker than the old series, but much better tech! A great recruiting tool. Loved it !",1448928000,,256,3.672727272727273
8133386,5,B000GLKNRS,"A ""VERY"" GOOD RETELLING of the original Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons series.  Some of the BEST CGI I've seen, ANYWHERE.  Good characterazations, good pacing, and even good musical timing.

TE ""ONLY"" COMPLAINT I CAN GIVE IS THAT THERE AREN'T MORE EPISODES!!!!!

For the HARDWARE geek, the ACTION fan, AND ESPECIALLY THE SCIENCE FICTION FAN, watch this one!!!!!",1432944000,,364,5.224137931034483
8133387,5,B000GLKNRS,"My only hesitation about getting this was the region 2.  I just recently decided to watch it and I love it.  Of course, I am a die-hard fan of SuperMarionation and this is different.  Wish it had more series, but am happy to be able to get this",1405987200,,244,4.041666666666667
8133388,5,B000GLKNRS,I had to buy a converter to watch this and it was worth very bit of my money. I loved it when it was on cable and I love it more that it is now mine to watch anytime I want.,1394409600,,173,3.2439024390243905
8133389,5,B000GLKNRS,"Enjoying watching this series here in Canada after all these years. Fantastic detail in the CGI and great story lines.
Even though Region 2 (U.K) able to watch it with a region free DVD player.",1394409600,,193,4.542857142857143
