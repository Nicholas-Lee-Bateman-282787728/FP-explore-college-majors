Introducing Jason Rafiel

A relative of Aunt Jane's pays her way for a rest in the West Indies. There she is still sort of out of place with the exception of talkative Major Palgrave who turns up dead. Aunt Jane is teaming up with and usually out guessing another guest (the exocentric millionaire) Mr. Rafael. In the process a few more murders show up and everyone looks suspicious.

This story introduces you to Jason Rafiel who will turn up again in ""Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, V. 7: Nemesis (1986) ASIN: 6303404855.

I t was an intriguing touch to have the dead person's spirit supposed to come back after nine days to get revenge.

You will want to view this movie several times to see how the plot could have gone. Later this movie will be like a friend and just need watching again.

""The Mirror Cracked from Side to Side""

Mirror Cracked from Side to Side

Aunt Jane finds herself at a local an annual summer garden party hosted by the new owners of Gossington Hall. The new owner is an aging movie star who is at odds with the studio producing the latest movie. A visitor mysteriously dies. People start dropping like flies and the Movie Star (Marina) knows she is next. The title of the movie is taken from ""The Lady of Shallot""

Joan Hickson is Miss Marple. Agatha Christie always considered her as the ideal Miss Marple; she shows this through her reserve savvy. Jane takes an interactive interest in the mystery and yet each character as part of the discovery, stands on their own. The ending of the story is as is in life, it is appropriate not black and white judgmental.",1507766400,4,1613,4.553633217993079

8165631,3,B000M1MFBE,"I love all things Marple!! Regardless of which actress, slight changes to stories, even placing her in stories Christie never intended. I do have to say these 2 particular shows were very 70's. Reminded me of those retro movies with the woman running through the woods in a long silky robe... However the stories themselves are great.",1252800000,,334,4.87719298245614
