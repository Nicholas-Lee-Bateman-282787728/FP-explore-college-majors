3792012,3,B001TKNWVO,"This is definitely a chick-flick, and for the most part I liked it. It had some beautiful Hawaiian scenery and also some nice holiday shots. Where I really cringed was how Heather Locklear's character's daughter was portrayed. So unrealistically sugary sweet: very annoying. I wish in writing the script, they would have made her a little less unbelievable and syrupy.",1479686400,,368,5.15

3792030,4,B001TKNWVO,Okay this is a total guilty pleasure because I realize that this is not a top of the line made movie but I really got into it and thought it was cute.  I love the lead make actor (guy from IZombie).  He was actually the best part of the movie and had the best acting.  I like Heather Locklear but sometimes her acting is a big awkward.  Cute story though!,1456444800,,355,4.0285714285714285
3792031,5,B001TKNWVO,"It's my favorite love story movie. A woman hitting 40 falls for a man in his late 20's, same is true on his end. Everyone is against it. Just because it's not the norm, doesn't mean it can't be true love... Ladies, it'll make you mad, laugh and cry throughout the movie.",1455667200,3,270,4.211538461538462

3792034,3,B001TKNWVO,"Hollywood has always had older actors, especially female actors playing younger aged teens so it's no surprise that they didn't find an actress  around 40 to play Jackie, a career woman about to reach that milestone and instead went with Heather Locklear.  Why they didn't just call the film Flirty With Fifty is anyone's guess.  Jackie's friend can't use her ticket to Hawaii so persuades the I don't have time to take a break from my work mother to spend her birthday in Hawaii where she can also forget about the fact her ex has the kids and a girlfriend in her twenties.  Jackie is saved from a sleazy dude at the pool by a surfing instructor (Robert Buckley) who pretends she's late for a lesson.  Of course she pretty much decides to have a lesson and later do some cougaring.  The two couldn't have more different outlooks on life, he's invented some sort of biodegrade surf wax but doesn't want to leave his laid back lifestyle to make the product a success and she can't resist answering her phone at any time of night or day for a needy client.  Neither really wants to change where they live or their outlook on life.

The movie doesn't really reach any great writing heights, there's no twists in the plot or anything that happens by the end that you didn't expect would.  The ex husband is a bit of a jerk and hypocrite as you'd expect in this sort of movie.  The younger guy probably a bit too faultless to be believable, likewise her two kids who are little too happy and supportive all the time to pass as real kids, especially with the father behaving like he does.  There's plenty of swimsuit shots of both lead actors, a few hotel and other places bedroom scenes and pretty much everything else you'd expect with this sort of movie.  It's forgettable but has enough for most similar age to the father or mother character audiences that they might fantasize about being in that type of relationship themselves.",1447459200,,1928,4.556521739130435

3792088,5,B001TKNWVO,"Jackie (Heather Locklear) is a recently divorced mother of 2 vacationing alone in Hawaii for her 40th birthday. Against her better judgment, she allows the hunky, much younger, resident surf instructor (Bob Buckley) to sweep her off her feet.

What begins as a scorching hot one-night stand quickly turns into love as she jets off to Hawaii every chance she gets. But with kids, a disapproving ex-husband and friends, and an ocean separating them, real love becomes real tricky.

When Jackie loses her balance, it takes her lover to teach her how to get back on the board before she misses the one wave that will change her life. Based on the best-selling novel by Jane Porter.",1390521600,,677,4.777777777777778

3792100,3,B001TKNWVO,"The story line was ok....heard it before.  I thought Heather's character was really weak, and she was actually ""mean"" to ""Kyle"" when she left on the plane several times.  He was just HOT and I didn't know who he was before I watched it, so he's on my radar.  She doesn't pull off 40 very well, because she was closer to 50 when the movie took place!  Wish it would have been WAY MORE STEAMY and rated R!  he was over tanned, but oh well.  I thought her character was really cheezy when she got to Hawaii.  who wouldn't want to windsurf and who WOULDN'T want waves!  Why even go there otherwise!",1370390400,,594,4.241071428571429

3792103,5,B001TKNWVO,"Heather Locklear is the best - and this movie really is great!  A story of a woman turning  40, who is dealing with a nasty ex-husband and his much- younger girlfriend.  But karma is sweet when she too, meets a younger man and has the time of her life!  A movie to watch over and over again!",1362960000,3,291,4.052631578947368

3792119,4,B001TKNWVO,Love this movie. Fun for the older women that always wanted to go to the Islands. Nice to see a jerk ex-husband get what's coming to him as well. A fun chick flick.,1347494400,,164,4.0
3792120,5,B001TKNWVO,Was amazed at how quickly we received this item. It was in great shape. We are very happy! Thank you!,1323216000,,101,4.1
3792121,5,B001TKNWVO,"I really liked it. It has Heather Locklear in it and she is one of my favorite actresses. Shows what a single divorced woman can do on her own and manage a part time job and have 2 kids. Realistic, you be the judge. Loved the shooting in Hawaii. Not quite a travel video ad but does show a good part of it. Heather still has a great body and she should exercise to keep it that way. Yes I recommend it.",1312156800,,402,3.9146341463414633

3792125,5,B001TKNWVO,"I liked this movie a lot. I'm a huge fan of Robert Buckley's and I think he and Heather Locklear did a superb job. It was really cute and it just goes to show that love is free to give to anyone and that age is just a number.
I highly recommend this movie to all chick-flick lovers!",1286323200,4,282,3.8793103448275863

3792129,4,B001TKNWVO,This is a good movie with lots of emotion and takes you on the journey of a divorcee who meets and falls in love with someone half her age who resides on the island of Hawaii and how their love blossoms and develops into something that no one can believe ever could.  Great story.  Kind of like another version of How Stella Got Her Groove back but with a completely different cast and is very good.,1264809600,2,399,4.2368421052631575

3792131,4,B001TKNWVO,"We saw this movie on TV and wanted to add it to our collection.  It was great to see it without all of the commercials.  Heather was very believeable as a forty year old who meets and falls in love with a much younger man.  We liked the reactions of her best friends and how she resisted their trying to control her life.  We have watched this movie several times and will continue to enjoy it.  My wife and I definitely recommend this movie.  In fact, I am several years older than my wife and I hope that when I am gone, she can have such good luck as Jackie in Flirting with Forty!",1252713600,10,584,4.078947368421052

3792134,5,B001TKNWVO,"I just loved this movie.  Can't tell you how many times I have watched it since I purchased the DVD.

Heather Locklear and Robert Buckley make such a sweet couple.  It's hard to believe that in real life she is 20 yrs his senior.  They both look amazing.",1246924800,,254,4.229166666666667
3792135,4,B001TKNWVO,"I picked this up fairly randomly and really loved it.  It's feel-good story about life after 40, and the balances folks must face to ensure amidst all the sacrifices for family and career, that we still make a personal path to happiness.

I found it very believable, cute, and what some may call a ""chick flick"".  I plan to add it to my list of ""Christmas viewing"" since there are some really nice holiday scenes in it.

Heather and Robert were terrific.  And visually the movie is beautiful  with a number of scenes in Hawaii.

I am not sure why I hadn't heard of it before, but after seeing it I definitely recommend it!",1246665600,13,622,4.4035087719298245
3792136,1,B001TKNWVO,"The title should be renamed Flirting with Forty (that looks like 60).  Heather looks great for someone who got a lot of plastic surgery that went awry.  If she was able to act, then this movie might have been somewhat enjoyable.  Not good...",1244160000,3,241,4.558139534883721
3792137,1,B001TKNWVO,"First of all, Heather Locklear can only recite lines.  She has absolutely no acting skill whatsoever. There was not a single scene in this aweful excuse for a film that she gave one shred of credibility.

Whoever wrote the script also needs some lessons.  They attempted to rip off ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"", but apparently they can't even steal very well.  They also haven't spent very much time around kids.  They wrote the kids as being so polite and so caring and so loving and so obedient.  They endlessly doted on their mother for her birthday.  Uhh....Im sorry...but kids fight and call each names and whine sometimes.  The kids in this movie were far too sweet to be believable.

Locklear also needs to file a lawsuit against whoever is giving her the plastic surgery.  Her lips look ridiculous.  She looks like she got stung in the mouth by bees.  Her attempt to stave off being forty isn't working.

If you enjoy ridiculously contrived plots and horrid acting, then feel free to waste your time on this.  But if you have any standards at all, there are many many many love stories better than this tripe.",1243728000,7,1121,4.624365482233503
3792138,5,B001TKNWVO,"This is a great movie to distract the viewer from our tough economic times. Heather Locklear plays Jackie, a recently divorced mother of two who takes a vacation in Hawaii where she meets a much younger surfing instructor.  Happily, he is portrayed by Robert Buckley, a Hugh Jackman look-a-like.

Is is animal lust or true love? Will Jackie be dissuaded from this sweet gorgeous hunk by her ""well-meaning"" friends?  Will she master surfing in one lesson? Pop some corn, open some champagne and watch it yourself to find out.",1243641600,9,524,4.865168539325842
