Kibbles Rockin' Clubhouse has become part of our daily routine. We sing the songs EVERYDAY, during our calendar time where students work on social skills and also at the end of the day as a reminder. The video is also amazing, we watch it at least 3 times a week and sometimes more. My students who range in abilities love to watch Handy Sam, Kibble and the rest of the crew! Thank you to the team of amazing people who made this outstanding video and absolutely amazing songs for children with special needs. The greetings song is a MUST for my students. It has truly helped my students remember that we do not hug everyone, but simply wave hello or shake hands (a task that we've been working on for years!!) The song made it all make sense for them!! THANK YOU!!  We can't wait for more Kibbles Rockin' Clubhouse products! You guys Rock!! Any teacher or parent of special needs children NEEDS THIS!! You are going to LOVE IT!!

3059510,5,B00113PTAQ,"My 7 year old son has benefitted so much from this DVD.  He is on the high functioning end of the autism spectrum/Aspergers Syndrome (very verbal, academically advanced, but had no friends and difficulty with appropriate social interaction).  He learned from the DVD how to be more aware of his own emotions, such as ""I feel mad when someone takes my toy. I feel frustrated when I can't open my snack at school.""  With that seemingly simple step, he has made a leap in socialization skills.  He recently initiated a friendship at school, invited the new friend for a playdate, and both had fun at the playdate.  I think kids of different ages take different things from the DVD.

The Calm Down music video and song alone are worth the price of the DVD.  Both of my sons needed that, including my 5 year old who has no developmental issues, but is still working on controlling his temper.  They both learned from the DVD that they SHOULD try to calm down when they are mad, sad or scared, and HOW to calm down.  I've tried teaching them to take deep breaths before, but they weren't interested.

We love this DVD and the included CD.  Please make more!",1256083200,7,1151,4.51207729468599
3059511,1,B00113PTAQ,"My name is Megan- I'm a 29 year old married ICU nurse with a 20 month old son.  My sister, who has a Master's degree in special education, recently brought to my attention that my son, who was born prematurely, has a bit of a speech delay.  Lately, I've been doing much research in my free time to find early interventions to ameliorate this delay.  I enrolled my child in a Kindermusic class which has helped him immensely both with his communication skills, whether through signing or saying a few words such as ""truck"", ""mom"", ""yes"", etc.  We also watch Laurie Berkner's music videos on Noggin's website every night before books and bed. Additionally, I purchased all of the Spectrum Connection videos featuring Elizabeth Balzano, (Musical Therapist) whose songs help minimize children's frustration by boosting communication skills through music.  Her songs are fun, educational, and catchy- so much so, that I've actually downloaded all of them on my Ipod and play them for my son whenever he does not want to be in the car.  He immediately stops his tantrum and begins to clap his hands and dance excitedly when he hears her voice.  Elizabeth is warm, likeable, fun, genuine and not annoying to watch over and over.  When I bought Kibbles Rockin Clubhouse, I wrongly assumed that a $30.00 video would at very least provide stimulating, educational, musical therapy that would also be somewhat entertaining.  I was so excited when I received it (two days late) in the mail.  However, not even two minutes into the video, my son began to lose interest.  I even tried fast forwarding it to get to the songs, to no avail.  He became restless, irritated and fussy.  In defense of the video, the ideas are great and the songs mildly amusing, but they are presented by two of the most phony, overly-rehearsed, annoying individuals who didn't seem to have a clue as to how to relate to the kids involved and probably don't have any of their own.  Apparently, this video is especially geared toward the deficits involved in the lower-functioning portion of the autistic spectrum so perhaps in regards to this group, the video may prove useful.  Overall, I'm extremely dissappointed with my decision to purchase this video which is now collecting dust on a shelf somewhere.  Hope this review is helpful.",1242432000,7,2299,4.856410256410256
3059512,5,B00113PTAQ,"My 4 year old son LOVES this video!  We had tried the Teach to Talk video series by Jenny McCarthy and my son never really took to them.  But, he is loving this one.  He wants to watch it all the time and we sing along to the cd that is included when we're driving in the car.

The best thing is he is starting to apply their message of what to do when you get frustrated.  We've tried for a year to get him to take deep breaths and count to 10, but to no avail.  Now, after 3-4 viewings, he is starting to do it on his own.  Major breakthrough!

3059513,5,B00113PTAQ,I bought this video for my grandson who was diagnosed when he was two years old with slight to moderate autism. He is now three. His sister is four years old. Both of them love this video. It has helped the 3 year old mimic responses and try to use them on his own. He is saying Hi now. He was not before the video. His sister really can not get enough of the video. This video is  appropriate for pre-schoolers without autism. Both of my grandchildren love the songs in the video. They sing along with the children in the video. The calm down song really does put both of my grandchildren in a calmer mode. The lesson planning for this video is excellent. I actually enjoy it and especially the songs. They are simple and appropriate for the activity that the children are engaging in. The lesson planning and the music was well thought out. I like this video. I highly recommend this video. I cannot wait for the next volume to be released.,1223164800,,942,4.3522727272727275
3059514,5,B00113PTAQ,My 2 1/2 year old daughter was in love with this DVD from the moment it started.  It is so well done and is perfect for any young child (wouldn't need to be on the spectrum).

3059515,5,B00113PTAQ,"This was developed specifically for children on the autism spectrum by parents and experts in Speech and Music Therapy.  It starts off with a nice jingle.

The tunes are really catchy, the video is lively with many musical instruments being played by professionals. The setting is a club house where there is a schedule board with a large picture card indicating what is taking place and they have a circle time. Kibble is the stuffed dog that talks and has his own section after each lesson on the DVD. This is known as Kibbles world.

The forty minutes goes by quickly.  There are professional musicians playing a variety of instruments like the violin, flute, cello and drums.  The best segment is an outdoor one where they sing about being calm, all dressed in white admiring colorful flowers in a field.  Very serene like and uplifting with the music playing.

There are four kids portrayed in the movie representing all age groups and gender.  They have a schedule board they follow which utilizes big picture cards.  There are colored rugs, snack time and circle time.

It is perfectly suited for the recommended target age group of 3-7.  The skills taught are reinforced with kibbles world, which is interactive having kids choose the corresponding picture or phrase that has to do with the lesson just taught.

A fun engaging and motivating DVD plus the CD is great for listening at the computer or in the car.  Both are hits with my nonverbal son on the autism spectrum.",1219968000,11,1480,4.756862745098039
3059516,5,B00113PTAQ,"I purchased this video for my 4 year old daughter with ASD.  She is trying desperately to understand the different emotions and she absolutely loves this DVD.  The creators do a good job of covering the emotions - happy, sad, proud, angry and frustrated - from how to identify the facial expressions to how to deal with feelings of angry and frustrated.

Overall, the Kibble characters are very likeable, the music is catchy, and the use of labels is well done.  In the bonus features section of the DVD, there is a karoke section so that you can learn the words to the songs.  A CD is also enclosed so that you can take the music on the road.

I also purchased the Spectrum Connections DVD on emotions.  While both DVDs have their charms, my daugher (and I) prefer to watch the Kibble video.  I am hoping that Noteabilities will create new volumes in the near future.",1216080000,2,868,4.484076433121019
3059517,5,B00113PTAQ,"My 3 year old was recently diagnosed with Autism. At first, our Autistic son (Andy) was not sure he wanted to watch Kibbles because the only shows he liked were Thomas the train and Blue's Clues. Within 3 days Kibbles was his favorite video! He did not have a lot of spontaneous speech at the time he first watched this show (he was echolalic), but one day my 2 boys wanted to watch different shows. Andy said ""dog"". I said, ""blue's clues""? He said, ""Kibbles"". I said, ""okay just a minute"" and preceded to start my older son's show so that I could take Andy into the other room to watch Kibbles. When my older son's show began, Andy said, ""That's not Kibbles!"" which was a pretty complex sentence for him at the time. He loves the music and has lots of ""clips"" memorized. He makes jokes from things he's seen in the show like requesting cupcakes with frosting and sprinkles like the little girl does at snack time in the show and then he laughs at the joke he made.
Andy has learned many useful things from Kibbles and we listen to the musical social stories in the car that teach him to greet others, understand his feelings, keep calm when he is upset and ask for things he wants and needs. The surprise bonus is that my typical 6 year old is learning these lessons from Kibbles as well. We can't wait for the next DVD to come out because the only drawback to Kibbles is that mom can't get the music out of her head!",1207008000,,1418,4.294776119402985
3059518,5,B00113PTAQ,"What an excellent way to bridge music and soical skills with a fun and dynamic resource.  Just pop it in and you have an hour of Music Therapy and Speech Therapy combined.  What could be easier?  I loan it to clients and all the kids are ""hooked"" within the first few viewings.  It's great because it is something kids can watch on TV while you have to cook dinner, and you don't have to feel guilty about the kids watching a video, because they are learning.

I see a little girl with ASD who is 6 years old, and she requests the CD that accompanies the DVD each Speech Therapy session as a reward!  She sings the feelings song and acts out all the feelings, and has generalized that skill with lot's of people.

A wonderful gift for all kids and families with Autsim.

8240219,5,B00113PTAQ,"My four year old son has some pragmatic speech issue and self regulating problem. I bought this video and a few from the Watch Me Learn series (Let's play, School Day, Friends). They are all excellent. Kibbles Clubhouse is very well made. The image quality is better than that of the Watch Me Learn series. My four year old son sat through the forty minutes show and was fully engaged.

Compared with the Watch Me Learn series, Kibbles has a brief lecture for each topic. For example, the lead characters will tell the audience if you want to be friendly, you need to look at people in the eyes when saying hello. The Watch Me Learn series do not have this type of explicit instructions. It only shows the behavior (children being friendly with each other with good eye contact) for the audience to model. I think both are good for children older than 3. Younger kids may not get as much out of it as it does take some comprehensive abilities to understand the videos.

The price is high, $30 for 40 minutes. But I can understand why. The sales volume is very small so the video makers cannot offer a price similar to that of mainstream movies. I wish they have made Volume 2. But apparently, volume 1 is the only one available.",1382140800,,1228,4.453333333333333
8240220,5,B00113PTAQ,"My son is 4 years old and is autistic and thus, we are very careful when selecting programming for him.  A family member told us about Kibbles Rockin' Clubhouse and we eventually got it.  My son loved the DVD so much that he was watching it day in day out for hours at a time.  Unfortunately, due to rough housing it got damaged and no longer played so we had to replace it.  We got it here on Amazon and it came in record time thanks to Amazon Prime.
My son instantly recognized it and is back to watching it regularly or listening to its accompanying audio cd with all of the songs from the video.  He loves it, and I love watching his reaction to it.
It is fun, it is educational, and he enjoys it.  An additional important note.  My son goes to a special school due to his condition and this video follows the same kind of format that he has at school.  They use visuals, and follow a type of schedule in the video that he can relate to and can recognize.  This video has been, and continues to be very helpful for him and for us.

He watches it over and over, hums along with the songs and even puts a word in here and there.  The simple songs grow on you and we find ourselves humming them, too.  As others have mentioned, the Calm Down song is the best.  He rewinds that one repeatedly, and has fallen asleep to its comforting melody more than once.  The two adults have expressive faces and he seems to watch them sounding out the words. Parts of the program are a bit too advanced for him, but I think he'll grow into it.

8240223,5,B00113PTAQ,"You know a particular product is successful  when your child pulls out specific content (both positive and negative) and applies it to every day life.  Kibbles Rockin' Clubhouse: Expressing Yourself is a positive example of this.

Originally designed for children with autism, I believe this social skills DVD can help all children with meeting new people, saying goodbye, and in dealing with various emotions.

While some kids learn social skills by example, others - especially those under the autism and sensory umbrella - must be taught proper ways to handle new or difficult situations.  This DVD teaches a child appropriate ways to act through songs and actions.

Momma C's Thoughts:  What I love is that this DVD reinforces what we already work on at home.  Looking people in the eyes, saying ""hello"", getting under control.  These are things that all of our children work on but our sensory son particularly struggles with.  What I love is that Bubs has referred to things from the video.  This means that the DVD got to him on his level.

The actors in the video aren't over the top like so many children's videos.  The kids are real and not ""Barney like.""  Basically, an adult doesn't hate watching it!  I really find the songs catchy and fun.  I find myself singing them.

For each segment, the actor introduce a topic, there is a song, and then they have examples to test the child's understand of the topic.  For example, the children learn the ""h words"" for greeting someone (hi, hello, howdy).  Then the viewer chooses between four words which words are appropriate greeting words.

My favorite song is ""Calm Down.""  It is a sweet song that teaching a child to count to ten and breath when it is time to calm down.

There are several bonus features on the DVD as well as a separate Cd of the songs that comes in this package:

Kibbles' Karaoke
Sing along with the lyrics on the screen.

Bonus Kibbles' World
Play a game with Kibbles as he tests your knowledge on labeling feelings.

Therapeutic Benefits
Learn about the benefits of speech and music therapy and how those principles were incorporated into the design of the video.

Thank you to Noteabilities for giving me the opportunity to review this book.",1292112000,,2553,4.815668202764977
8240224,4,B00113PTAQ,"This is a good dvd for children on the spectrum.  I find that it took my children a while to enjoy it and that the skills taught are aimed for higher functioning or older children because the teaching method is oral and not very visual.  The great thing about this video is that it comes with a cd so that I played it in the car and got my kids acquainted with the songs and that helped them to be curious about the video.  Though I found Angela a little stiff in the video, her choice of topics and her lyric/musical writing are very pertinent and catchy.  There are some very good moments, and Jareb is a natural. There is also helpful resource information for parents.  This is one of our faves so far!  At least download the songs!  Looking for more songs from Angela!",1288828800,,772,4.2827586206896555
