8154667,5,B000K7I6DG,"If you never have or haven't recently been doing anything for your body, this is the first of the Core Performance Essentials series and should not be skipped. Mark Verstegen is an experience pro and excellent teacher. The series makes things easy because you are doing 30 minute sessions which start off with stretching and flexibility moves.
As someone who is about 30lbs overweight, with a lot of broken and repaired fractures that keep the TSA people wondering, I appreciate being able to move at my own pace as best possible even though the improvements aren't as fast as would be for someone younger than myself.
Workout cards showing moves are provided along with the DVD so it's easy to follow when you cant see your monitor.
Easily recommendable, enjoy feeling healthier.

The following are the continuation of the same series

8154668,5,B000K7I6DG,"I've decided that, as a relatively new runner, that I need to work more on my core fitness.  I am also always on the lookout for new things to incorporate into a boot camp class that I teach.  My fitness level is high enough that these exercises weren't all that challenging, but I have still spent a couple weeks in levels 1 and 2 before moving up because they will provide a foundation for the higher levels.  The exercises are very clearly illustrated and explained.  After watching and doing the exercises with the DVD, then you follow the sequence of the same exercises in a set amount of time as laid out on the accompanying card.  You will need a fitness band, an exercise ball, and some dumbbells.  I haven't tried any other core fitness programs, but I would recommend this one. I'm looking forward to continuing the programs and increasing my core strength.",1310774400,4,867,4.597402597402597
8154669,5,B000K7I6DG,"This is the first training DVD I've ever bought, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  However I've been pleasantly surprised!  The exercises are clearly demonstrated, and offer multiple levels (1A up to 2D).

Along with the DVDs, there's also two color laminated cards that describe the exercises.  So you don't have to re-watch the video every time you exercise.

The only slight negative is that I wish they had listed the recommended exercise equipment on the product box, so I would have known to buy that gear at the same time (knee pad & stretch band).  No big deal, since I just bought them after watching for the first time.  You can do the exercises without that gear, just easier on the body with them!  (and stretch band adds resistance)",1305676800,3,745,4.633587786259542
8154670,4,B000K7I6DG,"I am a personal trainer and I thought this was a well-explained dvd.  It is a good introductory dvd w/stretches, foam roller stretches and a few basic exercises to expand upon.",1296950400,3,176,4.67741935483871
8154671,4,B000K7I6DG,"I was introduced to Core Performance by my chiropractor, who highly recommended this program as a way to strengthen my back. The program itself is very effective, and if you follow it, you will feel results very quickly. The DVD itself is well-organized, no-frills, and easy to follow. The only thing that I don't like -- and it's a small thing -- is that there is virtually no pause between exercises, which means you barely have time to get into position for the next one. This fitness regimen is meant to be done within a specific timeframe, but even keeping that in mind, the transitions between exercises are too fast (at least for this 44 year old!). Just keep the remote control handy if you need to pause it for a few seconds while you re-position yourself. Despite that, I highly recommend this series. I don't like a lot of blaring music, overly-done production values, and ""fluff"" in exercise videos: just explain in easy-to-follow terms how to do the exercises correctly, and make it easy to follow along. The Core Performance series does just that.",1259280000,16,1061,4.7405405405405405
8154672,4,B000K7I6DG,"I have the whole series of DVD's as well as the books.. i think there some great information there.. however, I'm not 100% in agreement with the program design progressions.. As a corrective exercise specialist, I prefer my clients to do their 'Core' exercises at the end of their training hour.. Additionally, as simple as some of these seem, sedentary clients still need coaching. I have people that can't figure out what 90 degrees are without me..
