7957294,2,B00005YWK7,"Disappointing is the word that comes to mind. I had hoped for a more historical and accurate account of Christian beginnings that I could use as a teaching resource. Unfortunately, I found that the views of the ""scholars"" were filtered through a veil of tired secular revisionism. More akin to ""The Da Vinci Code"", the writers weave an account of Christianity that is neither biblical or historical; wishful thinking replaces scholarship. I have noticed that since 2001 (when this series was released) a bit more balanced use of scholars has emerged from similar documentaries. If the series writers had presenting both liberal and conservative views together at least we would have been give a glimpse of the controversies in bold contrast rather than only a docufiction.",1232668800,,772,5.134920634920635
7957295,5,B00005YWK7,"I thought that the programme was brilliant. If you're interested in history and humanity without looking through a veil of dogma then this programme is for you. Only PBS could put together such a programme. A network which is dependent upon corporate advertising could never produce a serious programme about Jesus and the movement which he inspired, without offending those who have an inflexible view of reality. This programme really makes you think. I guess that's what scares some people.",1103155200,14,493,5.175
7957296,1,B00005YWK7,"The reason I rated this DVD with 1 star is because I am a literal Bible believing Christian. I wanted to watch this to learn some more history of my religion but the problem is it starts off with the first disc vaguely going over the life of Jesus beginning with birth till the cruxifiction and doesn't acknowledge His divinity in any way. It doesn't talk about the miracles He did or that fact that He was the Son of God. It breifly talks about the resurrection, but just that His tomb was empty and suddenly everyone worshipped Him not mentioning the fact that over 500 people witnessed Him alive after He left that tomb. It even goes so far as to say that even though the Bible said King Herod sent an order to mass murder all the new borns at the time Jesus was born, that there is no evidence of that so we can't take it seriously. All I kept thinking is that if you're not going to take the Bible seriously you have no business doing a 13 disc series on Christianity. Do not waste your money or time watching this DVD if you are a Christian. If you are not a Christian and are interested in the life of Christ or being saved this is definately not beneficial. The people that made this have no faith in Christ so how can they give accurate information about Him. Try reading the Case for Faith or The Case for Christ. Also you can go to Christiananwers.net and buy The Hope DVD.",1083110400,16,1384,4.246212121212121
7957297,1,B00005YWK7,"Possibly one of the most unscholarly examinations of historical Christianity I've ever seen.  It started to get just plain silly.  This was obviously created by non-Christians, who are convinced that the Christian faith is a delusion.  Each time they refer to a belief upheld by historical Christianity, they qualify it with words like ""supposedly"" or ""so they believe,"" and yet will turn around and make assertions with no qualifying remarks, such as when they explain that the author of Revelation was not the apostle John.  They go on to claim that the author of Revelation was writing about the fall of the Roman Empire, not the end of the world.  Again - no qualifying statements, no supportive documentation or citations are offered.  This ""documentary"" offers the same quality of ""The Jesus Seminars"" in its assertions, and speculations.  The filmmakers go into great detail to explain that the Bible developed over many years, long after the historical Jesus was gone, and therefore cannot be considered a reliable document, but offer not a single shred of information or back it up.  Nary a single quote is presented, even though I know there are many available.  The creators unconditionally support the Q-manuscript theory, and Markan primacy.  I'm all for examining the history of Christianity, and I'm just as disappointed when Christians do this very same thing - offer assertions with no documentation or supporting facts.
For believers and non-believers alike: this is not a video that's going to give you a scholarly examination.  I originally purchased this video, knowing it was created by unbelievers, in order to demonstrate to my Sunday School class some of the issues that Christians need to respond to.  Unfortunately, this video offers nothing to truly *respond* to, since it makes assertions with absolutely nothing to back it up.  They might as well be saying that Attila the Hun was the originator of Christianity in Northern Asia.  How can one respond to an assertion with no facts?  There are much better documentaries out there.  A&E's ""Mysteries of the Bible"", though equally non-Christian, at least offers *some* documentation here and there.",1076112000,23,2175,5.153846153846154
