The reason i am writing is that I just want to make a correction to the other review.  Although a good guess that Mayrig is the main character's name it actually means mother, which is why she is referred to as Mayrig.  So the title of this movie translates to 'Mother'.",1436659200,,363,4.217391304347826
8438241,5,B000M1IM1Q,"I had the good fortune to watch Mayrig (I believe this is Claudia Cardinale's name in the film )in French with English subtitles in the MGM channel in Manila, Philippines.  It stars Omar Shariff and Claudia Cardinale who play the role of parents to a young boy as they escape Armenia and make a home in Paris despite all the odds.  This moving drama follows the boy's life from the time of their escape until he is a successful writer in Paris. A strong racist theme and a life of sacrifice weave throughout the movie. This is a 2-part film and I believe the first part has a different title.  I hope Amazon will carry the film in French with English subtitles.  I wouldn't hesitate to have it as part of my dvd library. The acting is superb and the story compelling.",1296172800,9,767,4.380281690140845
