If one learns it's little ideocracentracies and are patient, it is great.  The video allows one to see exactly what you need to see to get your experience with this machine.  Communications today is getting more difficult with the poor English that is learned form the street talk or people that create their own words.  Many other countries have dialects, well English speaking people do too.  This video speaks it's own language.  It tells you just like it is.",1381968000,,571,4.696969696969697

Approximately 60 minutes.
NTSC format 1VHS.
Playable with multisystem VHS players in the world.""
[from the experience]

""The knitting machine is best understood when viewed in action,
especially when the machine work is combined with hand techniques as fascinatingly varied as Susan Guagliumi's are.
Her years of experiment and demonstration at the knitting machine are distilled here into a richly informative workshop.
Sharp closeups, crisp editing and Guagliumi's masterly manner make these techniques a pleasure to learn.

Companion to her comprehensive book by the same title (page references appear on screen),
this video focuses on the most versatile of Guagliumi's techniques,
including twisted stitches,
woven stitches, fishscales and cables.
You'll learn:

* how to use specialized tools to manipulate stitches;
* two ways to lengthen stitches for further handworl;
* how to vary textures quickly and easily;
* how to personalize your garments using a limitless array of hand-manipulated stitches.

This video workshop,
in combination with the book,
will help you unlock the creative potential of your knitting machine.""
