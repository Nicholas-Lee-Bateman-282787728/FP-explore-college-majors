8749229,3,B003NI7LK8,As far as the songs and the attention for the kids we love it. However I could have sworn I bought this straight from the Amazon store did not say it was used or anything and when I received it and opened it the case is cracked the little things that hold the CD one of them is broke so the CD just slides around in the case and the CD is all scratched. It plays but it does get around. I'm going to keep it just because my kids loved it but it was in horrible condition,1484611200,,470,3.806122448979592
