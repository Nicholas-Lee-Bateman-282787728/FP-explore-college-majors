8433445,3,B004KUV20I,"The basic premise - a good-hearted slacker named Akio visits a temple known for its matchmaking mojo and at the insistence of his friend, writes his wish on a placard stating, ""marry me, I will make you happy."" To his surprise, he receives a letter from Sachi (happiness in Japanese) telling him that she'd like to take him up on his offer. What ensues is a convoluted and forced romantic movie that leaves you wondering why they don't just talk to each other a little more to clear up some deep misunderstandings that the movie's plot hinges on. There are long silences, flashbacks and minimal dialogue, which I assume worked better in the book this movie was based on. The movie itself is easy to watch, with an attractive cast and the rustic look of Okinawan island life.",1368316800,,774,4.615942028985507
