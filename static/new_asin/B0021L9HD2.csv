3840961,5,B0021L9HD2,"The DVD was in perfect condition, played flawlessly on both my computer and DVD player. No damage done to the case or DVD itself.",1360195200,,129,4.416666666666667
3840962,5,B0021L9HD2,"It really shows the deep and complex side of the Gorillaz, the struggles of putting up a live show, to keep up with their work and animate this awesome band",1358812800,,156,4.233333333333333
3840963,5,B0021L9HD2,"A classic and must have for GORILLAZ fans! This is a very funny and enjoyable film which takes you into the minds of creators Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. If the Gorillaz have made an impact in your life, musically and visually, like they have for me, then this needs to go into your cart immediately. The only thing I would've liked to see was more footage from the Demon Days era (it runs 1 hour: 'Self-titled/Celebrity Take Down' era; 30 mins: 'Demon Days'). Either way, do it to it.",1350604800,2,489,4.444444444444445
3840964,5,B0021L9HD2,"All I listen to is the Gorillaz so I was really excited to get this!
It really tells you what the Gorillaz are all about I even look at them in a different way, a even better way.
They are a really amazing and talented band. I can watch this DVD over and over.
If you aren't a die hard Gorillaz fan than I don't think this would be for you.",1312761600,2,340,3.8028169014084505
3840965,5,B0021L9HD2,I might be biased since I am a die hard gorillaz fan for years so I of course loved this.  It's a fast and fun dvd to watch and I will be breaking it out again soon to watch before going to the concert.  Must have if you like gorillaz!,1286755200,,235,3.68
3840966,5,B0021L9HD2,"Definitely worth watching if you're a fan of Damon, Jamie and/or Gorillaz. Highlights were Damon taking a crap on camera, Damon throwing up in Damon fashion, lots of witty cracks from Jamie and others. It's very real and I was highly entertained. As you would expect from this crew. Oh and Danger Mouse is not so much in it as hiding during a seriously brief cameo, as also to be expected.",1286496000,,389,4.492957746478873
3840967,4,B0021L9HD2,"Bananaz is a great insight into the creative process behind Gorillaz. There are plenty of scenes showing Damon Albarn collaborating with Jamie Hewlett, Dan ""The Automator"" Nakamura, Brian ""Danger Mouse"" Burton, Ibrahim Ferrer and a host of other musicians, rappers and even Dennis Hopper. Luckily it doesn't get too bogged down with detail.

The only problem I have with the DVD is that the special features are censored. Any time Jamie Hewlett says a swear word (and he does a lot), annoying sound samples are inserted. Either leave the uncensored words there and give the disc an NC-17 rating or replace with a silence.

3840968,5,B0021L9HD2,This is perfect for those who want to know more about the geniuses behind the cartoon band: Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. I would highly recommend this.,1271289600,,154,4.7407407407407405
3840969,4,B0021L9HD2,"It is a funny rude doco of making Gorilaz clips, a sexy in-site into a music band's ""kitchen"".

DVD itself is rather misleadingly over equipped with features as going to RUDE VERSION provided a feature rude enough if even played from PLAY command initially.

3840970,5,B0021L9HD2,"This is a fantastic cinema v&eacute;rit&eacute;-style rock documentary. If you are interested in getting behind the animated mystique that is Gorillaz, you should purchase this doc. This film has some great footage of Dan the Automator and Danger Mouse and all the special guests featured on each album. It really takes you through the development of the band, the characters, and each album and tour. I went bananas for Bananaz!",1257897600,5,429,5.142857142857143

8349317,5,B0021L9HD2,"This documentary is amazing & hilarious. Their ""play it by ear"" work process is interesting to watch. FYI this DVD does work for American DVD players. I've been playing it off of my MacBook pro & I've had no issues whatsoever.",1518825600,,226,4.536585365853658

8349323,5,B0021L9HD2,This is a great DVD/Documentary for anyone who loves Gorillaz. Damon & Jamie are so silly which what makes them even more funnier. Though it didn't play on my ps3 so I watched it on my ps4. Every Gorillaz fan should get this film!,1407456000,3,230,4.25

8349325,5,B0021L9HD2,"Bought as a gift for my boyfriend, who is a really big fan of Gorillaz, Jamie Hewlett, and Damon Albarn.

It's awesome to see the way Jamie and Damon work together and throw ideas around with their friends and collaborators-- such a colorful and lively bunch of creative folk! A wonderful and inspirational look behind-the-scenes for major Gorillaz fans, ESPECIALLY if you're interested in the visual arts/conceptualizing/cartooning/comics side of it.",1361491200,,451,5.442857142857143
