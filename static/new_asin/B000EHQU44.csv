2518924,5,B000EHQU44,"I've seen a huge number of bodybuilding videos and read bodybuilding magazines and thought that I had pretty much covered the material.  I found this DVD to be very educational.

I often buy the bodybuilding DVD's to see how one bodybuilder trains, and have everything from Arnold to Lee Haney to Ronnie Coleman. Instead of just showing you how you do the routines, this DVD explains the logic of why you should do things a certain way.  The POF system makes sense, although obviously it is not going to for everyone, and it would not be the only way to train for any one individual.

I learned more about the exact bodybuilding techniques and the reasons for doing them a certain way in this one DVD than any other I've seen.  It is the detail that sets it apart.

I did want to mention one thing.  With all of the attention that anabolic steroids have received these days, I felt a little guilty at times admiring the physiques in this DVD that are definitely not the product of natural bodybuilding. I think natural is the only way to go.

However, I don't think that it takes too much away from the effectiveness of the demonstrations. It is just something I noticed now that didn't bother me in the past.",1235088000,4,1209,4.488584474885845
2518925,4,B000EHQU44,"The theory behind this workout system reminds me of active isolated stretching.  It uses exercies that stress different areas of the range of motion for a muscle group.  By the time you finsh a routine you have a nice full pump.  This system does not use a high amount of sets.  As a matter of fact, it uses prettymuch the same amount of sets I was doing before, but is much more effective.  Highly recommended.",1199145600,,411,4.426666666666667
2518926,5,B000EHQU44,"I was looking long time for a DVD that would provide exercices demonstrations, not pictures with the beginning and the ending. There's something happening between begining and ending and to me it is an important part because it is important to know if it is performed correctly. Furthermore, this DVD explains you in details what is POF and its benefits. Buy it, you won't regret it!",1190160000,,383,4.818181818181818
2518927,4,B000EHQU44,"The video is very clear, the explanations are very well done. I am learning very much how to do my exercises, without paying a persnal trainer.

  The information of the video is perfect for me.",1174608000,3,194,4.485714285714286
2518928,5,B000EHQU44,"Loved it...it's like 5 hours long and for me, went slow enough that I could actually understand it.  Now I just have to hit the weights more!",1172102400,2,141,4.222222222222222
2518929,3,B000EHQU44,"I didn't know what PoF was, and I purchased this video to find out.  It does a good job of explaining the rather simple concept, and lays out the appropriate exercises reasonably well.  I'm not actually persuaded that PoF is better than other methods, but this video is a decent introduction.  Overpriced, though.",1170720000,10,313,4.867924528301887
2518930,5,B000EHQU44,"I purchased this DVD recently and I'm really impressed with it. Even though I'm not a bodybuilder or aspiring to be one, I am seriously into staying in shape (I'm just past my mid forties and have been continuously training for over 20 years.) Weight training is a significant part of my fitness program and I figure that if I'm going to do it I want to use the best and most efficient resources available. This POF approach is an interesting and apparently scientific approach. I also use X-reps (extended reps) in my training as well which is advocated by Steve Holman and Jonathan Lawson, the creators of POF training.

I believe they started using the X-reps later on, probably after this DVD was filmed so it's not part of this particular DVD. Still, it's not hard to incorporate X-reps into one's training. My understanding of X-reps is to use partials at the end of a full range of motion set to extend the exercise by working in a strong range. I like these better than forced reps because you have to totally control the weight which also seems less likely to cause injury.

Anyway, this DVD explains the primary priciples of POF (Positions of flexion)training. These involves using midrange, stretch and contracted positions (in that order). The stretch position is supposed to stimulate something called the myotatic reflex which is supposed to shock the muscle by putting it into an emergency mode which stimulates a stronger contraction. The DVD then goes through all the primary bodyparts showing how to train them using the POF technique.

I've originally found out about POF training by reading quite a few articles and interviews w/ Holman and Lawson. I was really intrigued by what they had to say, so when I saw this DVD I immediately ordered it.

It is well filmed and demonstrated. It is also very well organized. It first shows the various approaches of POF to the specific body part (midrange, stretch and contracted), then it goes on to show various routines you can use to hit that bodypart.

I like the fact that it lays out the material, shows a couple of variations of exercises, then summarizes each chapter for each bodypart.

 There's one technical observation I wanted to point out regarding the audio of the program. Sometimes the voiceover is a bit distorted. I'm not sure if there is too much bass mixed into the speaking voice or if it was recorded at too hot a signal, but it breaks up slightly from time to time. This doesn't effect the efficacy of the program, it's certainly more than clear enough, it's just an observation I wanted to pass along so that if someone orders it they know to expect it rather than being suprised by it. The whole program doesn't seem this way, mostly it seems to be in the beginning segments.",1161907200,25,2762,4.694214876033058

8109842,4,B000EHQU44,"This DVD is full of information and has tons of exercises in it, it's interesting how they recommend you do basically 3 different exercises for each bodypart, 1 for the midrange where it stresses your muscle in it's belly the most in the middle of the movement, 2nd one for the stretch basically at the beginning of the movement where it's the hardest and 3rd where your muscle is being worked the most when it's contracted, it's a little bit confusing though for beginners so they will have to watch the DVD several times and take notes but it's extremely informative, I think they have too many exercises for forearms though potentially and they recommend the sissy squat? I would have preferred them to include Dips which is a great exercise for Triceps and Chest mainly but it's not even mentioned in here and Leg Presses are mentioned but not even really recommended which is really odd but they do cover a lot of exercises and explain the movements well so I recommend this DVD for sure.",1416009600,,993,4.6158192090395485

8109844,5,B000EHQU44,This is an excellent dvd that uses a scientific approach to weight training. I've been using the POF routines in this dvd for the last 3 months an I have seen a vast improvement in not only muscle mass but also in the definition. The dvd brakes down the different body parts and the exercises to be done in sequence as it applies to the POF method. The section o Ab workout is one of the best routines I've ever done that garners quick results. Be advised that the routine's described in this dvd is meant for the intermediate to advance bodybuilder and beginners should us caution when applying these exercises.,1391990400,,612,4.5225225225225225

The POF Method is the FASTEST most Efficient way to do a Bodybuilding workout. Some people think that the POF DVD is Over Priced, I think those people don't value the Knowledge that the POF Method DVD gives its viewer. I would have paid much more money to a trainer and gotten lesser results. I have been using POF since 2006, POF is the Best way to work your Muscles. If you do, what the POF DVD says to do, you will grow your muscles to their potential.

8109847,5,B000EHQU44,"I was spending 2+ hours a day at the gym, 5 days a week.  In the beginning I saw results, but then I would taper off.  I watched this DVD, now I'm at the gym 45 mins, 4 days a week and I am getting double to triple the results. I can actually feel and see my body getting stronger.
This DVD enlightened me that I was doing many exercises, but that I wasn't actually hitting each muscle completely.  I love how this DVD shows you that you don't have to do a ton of exercises and a ton of sets to achieve results.  I love POF!  I love going to the gym now.",1262736000,6,554,3.824561403508772
