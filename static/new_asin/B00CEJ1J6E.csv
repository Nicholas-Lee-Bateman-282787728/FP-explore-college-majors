5718959,4,B00CEJ1J6E,"First-time director Shannah Laumeister pulls together a somewhat disorienting documentary about Bert Stern, who was arguably, one of the most innovative photographers of the last century.

The story line bounces about, documenting Stern's classic American success story life. Born poor and not educated, Stern became an established and very successful photographer by his mid-twenties.

His early job working for `Look' magazine got him his chance where he became friends with Stanley Kubrick.  Reluctantly interviewed, Stern discusses his life.  Most of it is about his womanizing and his drug abuse.  When he discusses his work, its magic - as if it was a different person.  His first successful series of shots was for Smirnoff and even by today's standards; his commercial photography was new, fresh and inventive.  His work with Kubrick included promotional shots for the infamous film, ""Lolita"".  His most famous work is the series of stills called, ""The Last Sitting""; a truly free and open session with Marilyn Monroe just weeks before her death.  The images are mesmerizing and his genius is palpable.

Director Laumeister was one of Stern's photographic subjects, girlfriend and eventual wife.  Somehow, this fact seems to cloud the films direction and the viewer is exposed to as many womanizing and drug stories as the world famous photography stories.  It's a little uneven and as a documentary director, Laumeister inserts herself into the film occasionally without adding anything to the story.  This is about Bert Stern.

The story is good enough that Stern's life comes across as bizarrely unique and amazingly successful.  It will make you want to learn more about his work, as the film leaves too many stories incomplete.  Film supplied by First Run Features for review.",1373500800,11,1789,5.268551236749117

Shannah L wisely directed the film by letting Bert Stern be Bert Stern and let him narrate in his own words the most intimate aspects of his super interesting life, the high and low phases of his professional and personal journey.
Having known Bert Stern i am grateful at the way this comprehensive doc handled his portrayal.
a must watch, bravo to Shannah L for this .

5719024,5,B00CEJ1J6E,I've been an admirer of Bert Stern for many years and was inspired by his work at a young age when I read about him as part of the Masters of contemporary photography series. I have a first addition of the Last Sitting and the story is as interesting as the images. This is kind of a rise / fall / recovery story that even Bert Stern isn't always comfortable telling but that I truly enjoyed hearing. There are many works of Bert Stern that will live on and I think this was a great look into his life done with him while he was alive and well worth watching.,1398816000,,559,4.090909090909091
5719025,5,B00CEJ1J6E,"I absolutely loved this rare glimpse into the life of Bert Stern.
I thought the movie was very tastefully done and I enjoyed the way it carried you from Bert's humble beginnings to when he first started to get his feet wet in photography, how he explained how he didn't even know how to use a light meter ,to setting the ground work for advertising as we know it.

Everyone knows about the Marilyn Monroe photos but there is so much in this movie you probably didn't know.

The movie was not designed to have you on the edge of your seat or to give you heart failure from fear.
I thought Shannah Laumeister did excellent work here and Bert seemed really comfortable sharing his experiences with us and I thought that was a treat in its self, A very open and honest man,through the way he explains everything you can really feel he loved his work and the people wanted him to do the work because he had a brilliant eye for helping us see things would have otherwise missed,

I think Shanna Laumeister proves she is far more than just a pretty face with this rare glimpse.of Bert Stern,
What he was like to work with, work around or to become the subject of his work,to be frozen in time for ever .

Bravo !  I hope their is more to come from Shannah.",1394064000,,1249,4.27542372881356
5719026,3,B00CEJ1J6E,"If your primary interest is in Stern's photography rather than his life, you will be disappointed. Far too much emphasis, in my opinion, on his endless, screwed-up love affairs and dysfunctional private life and far too little on his work. For those interested in his art, seek out books of his images, rather than this tedious documentary.",1386374400,,340,4.982456140350878
5719027,1,B00CEJ1J6E,I saw this in the theater--and was shocked to see a friend of mine in the film (hi Charlie!)--but even knowing someone could not make me feel good about such a botched opportunity. The filmmaker had access to a rare talent and this is what we have to show for it? Too bad someone with skill could not have been behind the camera.,1376438400,,329,4.238095238095238
5719028,5,B00CEJ1J6E,"As I watched this 89-minute 2011 film on DVD today, knowing that photographer Bert Stern died (at age 83) on June 26th, there was one question that Director Shannah Laumeister asks near the end the film that took on new meaning based on his recent death. She asks Stern, who has just finished telling us how bored he is with life in his older years (and comments on the thousands of photos he still has), ""Who's going to handle your archives?"" ""I don't know"", Stern replies. Then we see the auction he attends where a folio of 16 photos he took of Marilyn Monroe are sold. The price: $113,000. Two years later Stern is dead and I, for one, am curious to know if they were donated or sold to private collectors.

But we are here to discuss the film and the DVD, aren't we? I found it fascinating (as well as great DVD to test out my new flat screen HD TV). The film is on DVD (not Blu ray). A few of the other reviews I read said that they thought the film was lacking in depth and they wanted more info on Stern. I took a different approach (which may be why my rating is higher). Rather than a biography of the artist (and Stern was a creative artist as well as a photographic one), I saw this as a ""portrait"". The narration is by Stern and Director Laumeister does arrange the story chronologically. She is primarily an actress, though I have not seen any of the plays (mostly off-Broadway) or films she has appeared in and, as you will learn during the film, she became his model when she was 18 years old. They had an ongoing relationship - though they never married.  Stern did get married at least twice and Laumeister interviews those women - one of who was not happy with Stern and tells us on camera.

Stern had multiple talents - and I won't go into details (that's why you want to see the film, right?) but we hear about his ad campaigns from well-known ad execs, we hear about his celebrity photos from 1960s model (later a movie and Broadway actress) Twiggy, and about the one and only film he directed: the legendary ""Jazz on a Summer Day"" - unquestionably the best jazz film ever made.

Other parts reveal stories that only Stern could tell, like the story behind the red heart shaped glasses that Sue Lyon wore in the film ""Lolita"". (Great story! -But no spoiler alert here.)

There are enough great images in this film that - honestly - you could play it with the sound off and the images would keep you entertained.  Okay, I wish that the director had added a commentary track or at least a short bonus interview about the filming. But that's only a wish. The bonuses are limited to a ""Photo Gallery"" and a text bio of the Director.

If you are interested in celebrities or portrait or fashion photography or creative advertising, I think you'll like this film. Stern excelled in all those areas. He only failed in his marriages and family.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5719029,5,B00CEJ1J6E,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  This documentary presents us a story of the life, love and work of Bert Stern.  It weaves an interview with Bert Stern himself with looking at his timeless photographs.  It was very interesting to hear the stories behind the famous photographs.

His photos are not just images, each one creates a story.  His photo compositions were innovations, he came up with angles and backgrounds that no one has seen or imagined before. His eyes were able to isolates and defines images others did not see. I am avid photographer and really enjoyed learning of how he came up with the ideas for his photographs. Many of his compositional ideas are now taught in every photography class.

The movie covers his commercial photography, which created modern advertising as we know it, as well as portraiture work of beautiful women.  We get a glimpse of his personal relationships with various models, including Marilyn Monroe.  He had an ability to establish an amazing personal relationship with the model, and that intimacy came through in the pictures. He could spark something in the woman that made her come alive in the photo. The way they look at him is the way we fantasize they would look at us.  He shared a piece of his passion with us, the viewer.

The movie ends with a quote which perfectly describes his photographic portraits.  He said that the pictures themselves are better than making out with a woman because the pictures are for ever.

I am grateful for First Run Features for asking me to review this movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to others.
