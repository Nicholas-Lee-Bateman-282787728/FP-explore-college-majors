8244003,5,B00125WATG,"My daughters, 2 and 4 years, love the show even though they do not understand English. They need minimal translation because the acting makes it easy to understand what is going on. My children have learned some English words and they show much more intrest in cleaning up their room. They could watch it for the whole day but I only allow 2-3 hours of TV. I highly recomend this show.",1260835200,,385,4.436619718309859
