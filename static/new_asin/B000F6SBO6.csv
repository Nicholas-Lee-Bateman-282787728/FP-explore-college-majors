8118007,5,B000F6SBO6,"To clear the air this is a bootleg.  However, this is an extremely well made bootleg.  Because the actual OAV boxset is so expensive I decided to opt for this product despite the usual reservation one feels about investing in a bootleg.  Have no fear though, this is a professionally done product!

Also, though it says Tenchi Muyo Ryo-oh-ki on it, it is the ORIGINAL OVA not the recently released sequel boxset to the OVA as released by Funimation.

Highlights about Tenchi Muyo OVA bootleg:

- The case is nice and the DVDs look professionally done.  The menu screen is also nice.

- The episodes are uncut and just as perfect as the original.

- Great Dolby 5.1 audio.

- You receive all 3 Tenchi movies on one disc.

- It is inexpensive compared to the official OVA boxset, especially considering you get all 3 movies.

Having grown up with the Tenchi Muyo! series on Toonami it is nice to finally have an unedited, affordable version. If you want to buy the Tenchi OVA this is the product to get.",1281398400,,1001,4.5
8118008,1,B000F6SBO6,"This is a bootleg HK dvd.  The fact that its only two discs is pretty obvious.  If you want to see someone put this back out, perhaps Funimation who owns the rights to the third ova, then don't waste money on garbage like this.",1267574400,,227,4.136363636363637
8118009,4,B000F6SBO6,"This boxset was a nice addition to the Tenchi Muyo series as I have already owned the Tenchi Universe boxset. Actually the OVA episodes were a precursor, the first 13 episodes included in this boxset are. But the newer 7 episodes that were created almost some 10 years later lacked the initial punch the first 13 OVA episodes. It strayed a bit from the formula adding a few new oddball characters that didn't grab my attention as Ryoko and Ayeka. Or the mad scientist Washu and gramps Yosho. Id stick with the first 13 OVA and leave it at that. The other cool addition is the 3 movies included in the boxset which are Tenchi Muyo : Movie, Tenchi Daughter of Darkness, and Tenchi Muyo III. I recommend the first and third movie but the second one was kinda so and so with the goofy daughter and what not. I love the series and i would recommend it to any Tenchi Muyo fan, but the 7 newer episodes and that Daughter of Darkness movie ? Nah either get use to it or ignore it, whatever works for the nice lower price.",1258848000,,1013,4.30890052356021
8118010,4,B000F6SBO6,"I was unsure when I first brought this DVD if I would like it but I can honestly say that I am glad I did. It contains both the OVAs and the three movies and it didn't even cost that much. You can't find these by themselves and if you do they are out of print and if you can find used copies the people selling usually want way to much so I was glad that I found this collection for so cheap.
The only things wrong that I seen was that the writing and credits are Japanese only but that not such a big deal, it comes in Japanese(with subs) and English so however you want to watch your anime you can.",1254700800,,600,3.886178861788618
8118011,4,B000F6SBO6,The newest version of ryo oki was fun but some of the background was missing this filled it in wonderfully. And as always this is a very fun and light hearted series.,1242086400,,166,4.21875
8118012,3,B000F6SBO6,"I didn't pay attention and realize I was buying a bootleg - but then I also didn't see a Genon/Pioneer boxed set of the original Tenchi series advertised, either. I knocked a full star off the product rating because this set is an unauthorized issue. That being said, I bought this set at a replacement for my original Tenchi Muyo laser discs, which I could no longer watch as my Pioneer laser disc player finally gave out after many years. Since I paid $60 each for the original discs back when Tenchi was new, I won't loose too much sleep over having bought a bootleg replacement, however, it would be nice if Amazon would mark the product clearly as an unauthorized edtion.

If you've never seen Tenchi Muyo - and if you haven't, where have you been the last 12 years? - the series is very losely based on Japanese folk tales about a prince who is torn between his love for a princess and his love for a demon queen. Only it's set in modern day Japan and the demon is a space pirate and the princesses are nearly immortal space aliens. Tenchi is, at first, billed as a ""normal"" high school student who also, inexplicably, is in training to take over the family shrine, as a priest in some never mentioned religious sect. This whole premise is quickly abandoned as the whackiness builds and more and more young ladies arrive, all of them having the goal of getting Tenchi into the sack. Somehow, however, none of the girls ever manage to follow through. Then, suddenly, super villians appear and it is up to Tenchi to aquire powers of his own and save the day. Repeatedly. And then to try to go back to being a normal High School student.  The producers built up a scenario whereby Tenchi needs to choose between the princess (Ayeka) and the demon (Rhoyko) who are so busy fighting each other for Tenchi's attention they don't realize little princess Sasami, the prefect housekeeper, is apt to sneak in and steal Tenchi's heart.  Then, having set the whole scenario up, they fail to capitalize on it. The series ends totally up in the air, with the love triangle unresolved. The original 26 episode OVA was then followed by three silly specials, which form side stories to the OVA - they are kind of fantasies told by Mihoshi and Sasami - and are inexplicably missing from this set. Instead, we are given the three sequel Tenchi Movies, which also utterly fail to resolve the main premise, instead bringing in mysterious daughters, love interests, and events that have little to do with the original Tenchi Muyo cannon.

All in all, this is a good set for collecting the original OVA, and the production value is also better than the original laser discs. The original OVA discs were marred by many of the sound effects being missing from the english dialog tracks - the most noticeable being Ryoho's footsteps as she sneaks down the highschool hallway while stalking Tenchi being completely missing on the english side, and on some of the laser discs the engish tracks were unplayable, feeding out static and muddied dialog. These defects are gone on the DVDs.

It is charming to go back and watch the original OVAs once again, and remember a time when the Pioneer Laser Discs were the only avenue of buying anime in the mainstream market. And is it amusing to remember how the ""hot springs"" episode Laser Disc was delayed and almost cancelled because the girls were clad only in towels! How innocent we all were back then.  The original OVAs are marred only by the failure of the producers to bring the series to a satisfying conclusion - a decision that might have been acceptable if they had continued the series. Instead, each of the movies and series that followed were, inexplicably, botched retreads of the Tenchi story, set in alternate Tenchi universes, and none of them were up to the quality standards of the original OVAs. And this DVD collection is only marred by the fact that it is an ""unauthorized edition"".  Genon might want to consider labeling their product clearly as the only authorized edition, as I would have bought the real thing had I realized this was a bootleg.",1181347200,2,4092,4.643646408839779
8118013,1,B000F6SBO6,"I hate to say this but this not an original genuine made DVD set from Geneon. This is a bootleg from the Japanese bootlegging group FX. FX has been around for sometime making Bootlegs like this. I hate to say this but I was fooled twice by them. This and a Gundam Wing DVD set both I got cheap at my local gamestop. (Each under 20 bucks and ironically they are in troupble for actually selling both.) When you take a look at the actual box it will not show the copyrights to who owns it (Cause all DVD's that are legal carry the copyrights to who owns it.)

Owning this is technically illegal, and selling it in the US is technically illegal. I suggest you don't buy this and go for the original version released by Geneon (or Pioneer witch is what it was when the first edition was sold from)

They now sell it in the $114 dollar version (Witch contains a bonus 3rd disc with all special features from blueprints and pictures to the house to TV spots, commercials, even 2 music videos) or the 2 seperate disc versions you can get for 20 bucks each a saving of $15 dollars off the price of this. (Considering it's only 2 DVD's you got to buy seperate.)

This DVD set though rips off the $114 dollar versions 2 discs of episodes by having everything exactly from menu's to the Dolby logo in their (And the FBI warnings though were taken out that adds to the point it's a bootleg.)

Be smart and don't buy a bootleg.",1172880000,3,1414,4.264925373134329
8118014,5,B000F6SBO6,"At first, I wasn't too sure about purchasing this DVD collection, but after it arrived all of my fears were put to rest. Yes, this is an imported DVD, but I didn't experience the same problems as other buyers did with it. The audio track, is Dolby 5.1 digital sound, and sounds crisp and crystal clear in both English & Japanese! And it plays just fine on my DVD player and my PS2.
This collection contains all 13 original, unedited episodes of the Tenchi Muyo series, plus 3 movies! These movies are ""Tenchi Muyo: Tenchi in love"" Tenchi Muyo 2: Tenchi forever!"" and ""Tenchi Muyo: Daughter of Darkness"" These 3 movies don't really connect to the ova series, but it's a nice addition to the DVD package, and good for any Tenchi Muyo fan.

Now to clear up a few things for potential buyers...  Even though this DVD's case has ""Ryo ohki"" printed on the cover, this is not the second season of Tenchi Muyo. I don't know why it says Ryo oh ki on the cover, but keep in mind this is an import. Next, even though this DVD does not have a listed Region anywhere on the box, it plays just fine in my Region 1 DVD player! (Incase you didn't know, Region 1 is the regional coding for the US and Canada.) And finally... Sadly, the begining and ending credits have not been traslated to English, it's all in Hiragana*.(*Japanese characters*) Because of this, it's really hard to understand what happened between episode 4 & 5. Something happens between those two episodes that is never really shown, (Long story short, Tenchi fought Kagato and lost!) It does tell you what happened at the begining of episode 5, but it's all in Hiragana so unless you know how to read Japanese it really leaves you in the dark.

I myself am very happy with my purchase of this DVD collection of the Tenchi Muyo series! It's a very good collection, and much cheaper than the Geneon signature series. Plus, most of the other Tenchi Muyo collections cost around 70 dollars, and they come it sets of 7 DVDs! This one only cost me 20 dollars plus S&H, and there are only 3 DVDs in this collection so it saves you alot of space.
I highly recommend this DVD collection of the Tenchi Muyo OVA & movies!

(Ages 13+)
Some of the episodes on this DVD may contain...
Mild violence.
Sexual humor. (Some of these jokes will make you feel really uncomfortable)
Nudity. (occures often throughout the DVD, but it's not much worse than something you'd see in Disney's Fantasia movie)

Final thoughts: It would be nice if they'd come out with an edited version of this DVD. Although I didn't have a problem with most of the content, I didn't really care for the sexual humor.",1153353600,7,2626,4.485355648535565
8118015,5,B000F6SBO6,"I don't know what that other guys problem was, maybe hes got an old DVD player or a slow computer but I also have a copy of this set and it is perfect in every way.  Audio is spot on, the subtitles are different from the audio but that's probably what the Japanese audio actually says.  You can't beat the price for the OVA and the movies all together in one package!!  3 DVDs instead of like 7 if you bought those other sets, even a space saver too.",1144972800,8,450,4.033707865168539
8118016,2,B000F6SBO6,"I recently ordered this item off of another website only to find out that this item is an import.  It is made in Hong Kong and shipped to the U.S.  After watching a few episodes, i found the dubbing to be a little off and the picture can get fuzzy sometimes.  In my opinion it is better to go with the U.S. version for the quality and special features.

If you want don't mind the poor quality and off dubbing than this can be a good deal considering the OVA normally goes for about 70 dollars.",1144800000,,494,4.114583333333333
