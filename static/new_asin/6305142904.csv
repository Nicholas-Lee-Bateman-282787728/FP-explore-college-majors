At the age of 21, I just watched it for the first time two nights ago.  I love it!  The music, the guest stars, the jokes; they're all great!  There are definitely elements of this special that can be enjoyed by adults, as well as kids.  And, as its title indicates, the video also gives you a good idea of what Passover is about and the traditions that go along with it.  This special was made after the show ""Lamb Chop's Play Along!"" ended and before the show ""The Charlie Horse Music Pizza"" began, as far as I can tell, and you can see the ""transition"" in the form of one of the guest stars: Dom DeLuise.  In ""Shari's Passover Surprise"", he technically plays himself, but also the role of a cook, just as he did in ""The Charlie Horse Music Pizza"".  I would definitely recommend this video!",1364428800,,936,4.219101123595506
