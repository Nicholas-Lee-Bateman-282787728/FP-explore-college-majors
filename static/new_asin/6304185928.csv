806336,3,6304185928,"A 1996 French film.
  This film is not highly dramatic as a motion picture, but this story of mary is told in a fast pace style.  Events go by so quickly you hardly have time to absorb them as a story.  Not a great deal was spent on special effects except for a stage light bulb.  Whenever the angel Gabriel is represented, this film depicts it as a bright light shining upon Mary, Joseph or the Three Wise Men and with a woman's voice.
  You won't get too much historical accuratcy here in this film.  So much was not covered.  There is no story of why Joseph and mary had to find a manger (the inns were full due to harvest time), the star of Bethlehem is never discussed, the hiding of Joseph and mary with Jesus is not dramatized and neither is the Census (the counting of the people).
  Although this film was quoted by Terry Meeuwsen of the ""700 Club"" as ""unique"" and ""will touch your heart"", there are some scenes of blood and violence that should not be viewed by children.
  How Jesus met each of his disciples and many of his miracles are not shown in this film.
 The Last Supper setting is probably more accurate than any other film.
  Myriam Muller portrays ""Mary"" (The Mother of Jesus), Francis Lalanne portrays ""Joseph"" (the Father of Jesus), Didier Bienaime portrays ""Jesus"", Pierre Lacan portrays ""Judas"" (the betrayer), Myriam Mezieres portrays ""Mary de Magdala"", Thierry Maillot portrays ""John The Baptist"" (Jesus' cousin).
  French actor, Didier Bienaime who played ""Jesus"", died from a heart attack at the age of 43 on August 7, 2004.

  For a highly dramatic and emotional telling of the life of Jesus, more in-depth and the most accurate and accepted film version, I recommend the NBC-tv miniseries, Jesus of Nazareth (1977) with Robert Powell as ""Jesus"" and with an all-star cast.  ""Jesus of Nazareth (1977) is available from Amazon.com on VHS and DVD.
  Yes. After Mary Magdalene, Mary and Salome discovered Jesus' tomb empty, Jesus was Resurrected (late Saturday afternoon) and during those 40 days visited his disciples.  Then he ascended up in the clouds to be with his Father.  Jesus promised that he will return (The Second Coming).  Some believe it will be 2000 years after his death (this would reach to the 7000 years).  Could Jesus return April 6, 2029, April 7, 2030 or April 25, 2031?
  We are not allowed to know the exact date.  Jesus will return (with angels) to Earth to judge and reign over all nations in the Kingdom of God will be visible.",1116028800,7,2481,4.63448275862069
806337,4,6304185928,"Very little is mentioned of Mary in the Gospels, so obviously much about the life of Mary has to come from reflections on the Gospels.

The movie is carefully directed not to stray too far from the Gospel account.  There are still some inaccuracies, Mary is shown in the opening scene as a teenager walking down a road greeting people with a 'high five', 'good morning...' and 'Hi...'.  These are not Jewish greetings of the first century.

Secondly, Mary is shown by the Lord's side throughout His public ministry.  In the Gospels Mary is mentioned only twice during the public ministry of our Lord, at Cana and at Calvary.  So obviously much of the scenes are the imagination of the director.  Though none of the scenes contradict the teaching of the Gospels (theologically).  Some of the scenes are very meaningful and touching and provokes reflection on the important Gospel events in the life of Jesus and Mary (and Joseph), and the relationship between them.

And lastly why does Jesus have to have blonde hair.  Palestinian men are not blondes, they have black hair.  Jesus was not an Anglo-American.

The movie is good and worth watching.  One would profit much by reflecting on the life of Mary as a Mother and a disciple of Jesus from the Gospel account.  Indeed, 'all generations will call her blessed.'",1110153600,10,1314,4.782222222222222
806338,4,6304185928,"This is one of the best Gospel films I have ever seen.  Especially good for Catholics, since it portrays the Gospel accounts of her life properly (for instance, the angel Gabriel calls her ""full of  grace"").
Two minor quibbles:  Mary seems to have labor pains (though  it's somewhat understated) and the movie rushes through Jesus' ministry a  bit quicker than I would have liked (though this is more a movie about Mary  than Jesus, so that's understandable).
I watched this movie along with  the 1979 Jesus film by the Genesis project; they complement each other very  well, each making up for the other's weaknesses.  Amazon.com doesn't seem  to carry that film, however :-(.  But this one is great!",961200000,,701,4.8559322033898304
806477,5,6304185928,"Out of numberless stories on the topic, this is the best and closest to the Bible story.  The viewpoint of the mother of Yeshua in all that happened to her son is a picture of why G-d chose her to be His mother.",1392508800,,211,3.9069767441860463
806478,5,6304185928,"I love this! I think that even non-Catholics should watch this one - my highest recommendations for those seeking a little more of a relationship with Mary. She was, after all, a human just like us.",1390435200,,198,4.527777777777778

806480,3,6304185928,This DVD was good.  I don't think it captured all that Mary went through in the life of Jesus. I flet there were some parts missing that i have read.,1390003200,,149,3.966666666666667
806481,4,6304185928,"I was a little put off very early on when Mary high-fives a passerby.  But the film is clearly intended to be respectful and true to the Gospels.  The first half has many gorgeous outdoor scenes.  The actors are all quite good, though John the Baptist seemed a bit off, until he got angry.  The story is necessarily compressed, so you may be disappointed at what is cut.  For me, truncating the Lord's Prayer seemed wrong, especially since the presentation of what was quoted was moving.

The latter half of the film may disappoint.  The nature of what is being portrayed requires a higher budget than they were working with to present as well as the first part of the film.  Some of the interior scenes had odd, unnatural lighting.  Still, for the age of the film, the visuals hold up very well.  Those involved clearly meant well, and what they produced is a fitting and inspirational depiction of the life of the Mother of Our Lord.",1389139200,4,935,4.544910179640719

806484,5,6304185928,"I saw this movie last night on TBN, and think I would buy it for a biblical movie collection, and I would enjoy seeing it again sometime. In production values, it seems like a made for TV movie. The authenticity of the sets and costumes were about average, I have seen better and I have seen far worse, although I really like Mary's families home and Joseph's workshop. The outdoor locations were good, very believable.

The movie is almost two separate movies, the first part being the Nativity story from the Bible, and this is where most Nativity movies, or movies about Mary end. But it continues into the story of Jesus through the Gospel until the Crucifixion. It should have been called Mary and Jesus maybe...
I almost didn't give it a chance when the opening scene had Mary walking alone in her village, greeting all the people including men, saying the phrase ""Hi!"", talking to men, and giving a boy on a donkey a high five! She goes into the shop of Joseph alone, before they have made any arrangements for marriage. I mean we know that young girls had to be very careful in public to protect their reputation, especially talking to men. I know they were just trying to show her as a well liked outgoing person.
In the second half of the movie, though they still show Mary often, she almost never speaks, and it kind of jars against the first half of the movie.
The actor that played Jesus was great, as were his apostles. The actor that played Joseph was good too.

They had a few elements from the Bible that you usually do not see in movies. For one they showed Herod when he broke out in sores before he died. They showed the instance where Jesus was told that his mother, 4 brothers, and his sisters wanted to speak to him outside of a room he was preaching in. Almost every movie about the Gospel never mentions the fact that the Bible states several times that Jesus had siblings. Another unique moment was Joseph speaking frankly to Mary about the possibility of her being stoned to death.
For some things, they had to dramatize or speculate as the Bible does not tell us everything that happened, but then this happens in almost every biblical movie, except ""The Visual Bible Series"" of films.
The picture and sound were good, music was good and not intrusive. There are many movies about the life of Jesus, and quite a few that include the Nativity story, and even some that are specific to Mary. But this one was a nice mix of all of these, and we enjoyed it. If you collect Biblical movies, I would recommend this for your collection.",1260144000,2,2557,4.484978540772532

7864520,5,6304185928,"This is my favorite movie depicting Jesus life. I type this as I wipe away tears with a kleenex. I have been a Christian (Catholic) my whole life. I have watched many movies about Jesus life and have been going to Church every Sunday for over 20 years. I was crying with a trueness that I wasn't expecting at all because every word Jesus said hit me like a ton of bricks. I got hit by the words I heard because real people are saying them in situations I can see myself in! I saw all the familiar truth Ive been taught, but from a new angle: the viewpoint of Mary. And this is hands down the most powerful and shocking way for me to see it as a child of God living 2015 years after. I felt like the Jesus actor was talking to me! I was right to feel that, because the real Jesus is! This movie is like you're reading the Bible with the added beautiful cultural and visual parts which make the experience so human. I want you to see this, and if your life changes like mine just did, don't thank me, but please thank the Holy Spirit who was working and inspiring to create this film. I now feel an urgency coming from me that I want to go out and do Gods Will, the will of Jesus like he told me in the movie. May God bless the people involved in this movie: this beautiful work!",1420329600,,1277,4.051383399209486
7864521,4,6304185928,"Mary Of Nazareth is a feature length film that tells the story of Mary from the Annunciation when an angel told her that she will become the mother of the Lord until the resurrection of her son Jesus.

The movie still manages to be enjoyable and entertaining despite the fact that Myriam Muller does not provide the best portrayal of the Blessed Virgin. Also,the pacing in some important parts were somewhat done quickly particularly the passion,death and resurrection of Jesus. But in spite of it,it also has its great moments such as the visitation of Mary to her cousin Elizabeth,when Jesus got lost in the temple when he was only twelve, and when Mary was following Jesus while carrying his cross. Overall,it would still be decent film about the Blessed Virgin.",1419465600,,765,4.8396946564885495
