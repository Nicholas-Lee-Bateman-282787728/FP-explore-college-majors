Good, clean fun, though adults may have to explain one or two jokes to younger children. Nothing inappropriate, I give this video 5 Stars.",1236643200,,256,4.711111111111111
8093238,5,B000BVNY56,"Daren's performance is phenomenal.  I have watched this DVD many times through with numerous groups of friends, and most of them have laughed to the point of tears!  The humor is 100% clean and is truly the most hysterical hour of television I have seen in my life.  Taking sarcastic jabs at everything from odd sports at the Olympics to the death drop water slide at the amusement park, Daren Streblow delivers a tremendously funny stand-up routine that you can walk away from feeling good about.",1140739200,4,497,4.755813953488372
