8514963,4,B007DCHZY2,"It is a very well sung and performed recording. The sound quality is very good, a very important issue with this Opera.

But curiously, it seems that Mr. Thielmann is conducting ""The Frau ohne Schatten"", and simultaneously, Mr. Loy is directing ""Ariadne auf Naxos"", as the Majordomo in Ariadne says: ""gleichzeitig"". Is this really a good idea?",1439251200,,343,5.017543859649122
8514964,1,B007DCHZY2,The Christoph Loys production is a lazy insult to this gorgeous opera.  The sound is distorted.  Singers cut notes short and sing out of tune . Christian Theilemann seems afraid to play the score with any gusto.  This recording is a travesty and total disservice to Richard Strauss's gorgeous score and  Hugo von Hofmannsthal's brilliant libretto.  Any other video of this opera is a MILLION times better than this one.,1395187200,2,419,4.928571428571429
8514965,3,B007DCHZY2,"Honestly! I am not a purest in any way, and I often enjoy modern productions very much. However; this reaches a new level of insanity. If you are going to stage it like this, just do it in connect and call it a day. The money that went into this production must have been so expensive (along with Loy's fee) and to have this result is really meaningless. There is a small documentary that helps to explain his concept. Even after watching that it's still difficult to believe what mess he made of this incredible opera.

Musically we have a performance that's just about as good as you could get these days. One minor disappointment is Anne Schwanewilms. It goes without saying that a section of her voice (range) is radiant and beautiful, but the very top notes just don't spin or flow as they should. One viewer mentioned her getting over a respiratory infection, but this is the third time I have heard her and its always the same. She is musical and very at ease in this production. But  this is a soprano that's working all over Europe and she will sing this role at The  MET in November. How can you be a world's leading Kaiserin and not have a glorious top? Of course no one is perfect (Rysanek certainly had her issues with the hole in her middle voice), but Strauss wrote this for a singer with a glorious top voice. Up to an A she's excellent, but most Bb's and above it's as if she goes off her support, etc. And the high Db ( in the Wehe, mein Mann) is a scream and hardly approximated. No amount of acting can cover that up! It saddens me because she IS talented and I so wanted to like her better. We need great Strauss sopranos! On the plus side; she's a beautiful woman and the timbre of her voice (save the very top) is haunting. Maybe I am being too hard on her? But I have never heard a Kaiserin without fabulous top notes (and I have seen my share of Fraus). That said, there IS much to enjoy in her performance. You can tell that she is a serious and gifted artist.

Evelyn Herlizius is amazing as the Dyer's wife. Not the most beautiful voice to ever sing the part, but she's rock solid and tender when needed (who really ever touched Ludwig's spectacular performances of this role? She sang with such beauty.). Yes, there are a few screams on a high note or two, but we expect that in this role. Her singing at the and of Act II is astounding. It takes her to her limit as a soprano, but she's in total command. This role is known as a ""killer"", and after Elektra it's as dramatic as it gets for Strauss. This quite an achievement.

Who is Michaela Schuster? WOW! Her singing as Die Amme is first rate (for any generation). Lipovsek on the Sawalich and Solti DVD sets is on the same level (quite astounding to be sure), but Schuster has a more beautiful voice. You can take this as a liability or an asset. The slight edge to Lipovsek's voice adds a sinister quality to the character, but all props have to be handed to Michaela Schuster for turning in this kind of performance (vocally). She's a good actress, but Loy (for all his talk of realism, etc) makes her a bit of an ""over the top"" nurse in a setting that is supposed to be ""symbolic and real"".

Stephen Gould is a very good Kaiser and copes with the role quite well. I haven't much more to say because his role is so underplayed in this production. Good solid singer in a role that is hard as hell on a tenor's voice.

I very much enjoyed Wolfgang Koch's Barak (again, I miss the size and beauty of Walter Berry's voice). His voice is on the lyric side for this role, but it  also adds a certain humanistic quality that is quite touching. And next to Herlizius the size difference is quite significant. Then again, we have a shrew against a gentle good hearted man....... It does work in this production, but that Orchestra is a big one!

Speaking of that orchestra; Thieliemann and the Salzburg Festival Orchestra are the stars of this performance. Absolutely incredible playing and musicality! It makes up for the crazy production in every way because musically it just takes you away. I started to forget about the ridiculous setting and let that magnificent score and wonderful performances take over.

All in all I find this DVD set worth my time and money.",1376006400,3,4245,4.382465057179162
8514966,5,B007DCHZY2,"Christof Loy's Salzburg production of Die Frau Ohne Schatten has aroused considerable comment both negative positive and has been  documented on Amazon's pages .Accordingly I am not going to dwell on the production to any degree. If you are not aware of the production I refer you to YouTube; the clips provided should give you a chance to arrive at your own conclusion.

Suffice it to say that since I already had the Solti and Swallisch DVD's I welcomed a regie interpretation. Loy would not have been my first choice as a director in view of his Entfurung from the Liceo which left a great deal to be desired. Not I hasten to add from the performance which I found exciting, but the production which took Minimalism to a new high (or low?). Loy's Frosch , however, has converted me to his aesthetic in large part due to the musical aspects of the performance and Thielemann's conducting and the playing of the Vienna Philharmonic, and in particular to the singing of Schwanenwilms, Herlitzius, and Schuster. Solti's performance also from Salzburg has a wonderful Empress in Cheryl Studer; the decline in her career is truly a sad one. Perhaps we will know the reasons one day. Marton's Dyer's wife is at the point in her vocal arc where she vacillates between a steady emission of tone and a wobble which has moved beyond incipient. The Sawallisch performance benefits from the conductor's love of the score but is underminied by the  casting of the Empress and the Dyer's wife. Neither are singers of distinction; surely the conductor could have made other choices but since this taping is in Japan and documents the Munich opera on tour one doesn't have to  look far for the reasons. Lipovsek repeats her nurse here. The one performance in which the Sawallisch trumps all others is Peter Sieffert's Kaiser, easily eclipsing Moser in the Solti and Gould in this most current performance. The American, Alan Titus, gives a better performance than one would have imagined, one superior to his newest competitor, Wolfgang Koch. Indeed it it is a matter of swings and roundabouts in viewing all these performances. The one real black mark that the Tokyo taping has to own up to is the cut required by the Japanese hosts. This was not Sawallisch's call since his studio recording is complete. Robert Hale is Solti's Barak; while he would never disloge memories of Schoeffler it is a more than respectable performance. When two American singers make more of the role than a native speaker............something is amiss.

Where the new set shines for me is the singing of the three women. All three are possessed of great charisma. Schwananwilms was recovering from a respiratory problem and perhaps he role is one size too large for her luminous voice. An ideal Marschallin one trusts that she will soon be cast as  Madeline and Ariadne and they will be taped to document her interpretations. She would seem to be too passive but the inner conflicts of the character are revealed in all that she does and sings. Her humanity and her love for her husband are reflected in voice and gesture. Herlitzius offers a committed and involved performance; it is not always beautiful vocally, but her understanding of the role is evident in everything she does. I can't remember seeing an artist so willing to risk all and succeeding so totally. Schuster's Nurse if beautifully sung and superbly characterized. It is a long and difficult role and she risses to the challenge.

Alas, Koch as Barak and Stephen Gould as the Kaiser are not in the same league as their partners. Fortunately the Kaiser has less to sing than Barak, but what we have here is reminiscent of the effortful singing Hans Hopf. That he role is difficult is a given as well as Strauss' dislike of the tenor voice, but the strangulated sounds are not pleasant and Gould would appears to have limited acting ability though truth to tell the role is a difficult one to bring off dramatically. Koch is the essence of bland. He is limited by his voice which is dry and insufficiently nuanced. Perhaps Loy's concept isn't doing him any favors, but I had hoped for more.

Perhaps the ultimate ""star"" of the performance is Thielemann and the Vienna Philharmonic. Solti hbad the same orchestra but his temperament is quite different than Thielemann's. Solti would appear to not trust his emotions while Thielemann is alive to every nuance and subtlety in the score as well as the big orchestral moments which abound in every act. Simply put it is a stunniing performance.",1339459200,9,4520,4.808236808236808
8514967,5,B007DCHZY2,"I approached this DVD with trepidation. It had received a couple good reviews. But I didn't like the idea of recreating its first audio recording. A Frau with no stage magic? Sounded like a cop out with all the stage magic just ignored.
 But just a few minutes into the opera I was hooked. Not by the stage picture but by the sound. Thielemann draws forth the most glorious sound from the Vienna Phil I have ever heard. It is a beauteous burnished gold. Thielemann takes a leisurely approach to the score, and he also gives us the complete Frau unlike most performances. He is over ten minutes longer than Solti (also complete), and the slow pace allows the piece to blossom. This is fantastically beautiful writing with not a hint of the bombast that is usually made of much of the score.
  Once the shock of the stage picture was over I was drawn in by the acting. This is a Frau with feeling. These characters may start out recording an opera but they quickly morph into their characters and, thanks to the direction from Loy, interact with great intensity, making this the pre-eminent Frau on DVD.
 But should it be your first exposure to Frau? Frau along with the Magic Flute is the ultimate fairy tale opera. It is full of special effects whose difficulty helped keep it off the stage for so long. Just how do you portray flying fish, an emperor turned to stone before your eyes, and golden fountains springing up on stage?
 Fortunately the other two recordings of Frau do take on the scenic challenge, and for a first time view you would do best with them. The Sawallish, from Japan, is filled with eye catching epiphanies. The Solti also cleaves to the original stage directions. It is not so fantastic as the Sawallish but it is complete, which the Sawallish is not.
 But what of the current production? True the stage magic is not there. But the intense interactions of the characters does not leave you longing for special effects. In sum the overwhelming reason this is the best Frau comes from Thielemann and his superb cast of singing actors. If you can't stand the production, turn off the video and you still have by far the best Frau on record.",1339027200,14,2161,4.556701030927835
