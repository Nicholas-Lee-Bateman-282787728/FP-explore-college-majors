6789027,2,B00P826P1I,"I went into this movie open-minded, though put off by the title. Product placement is one thing, but naming the movie after the dating site is just obnoxious. At least You've Got Mail wasn't called America Online. I watched this movie on the UP channel, and made it about  of the way through, but just didn't want to finish it. I feel like the actors did the best they could with an unbelievable script, but their efforts just couldn't save it. Almost everything that any of the Christian characters said was very fake and awkward sounding. I'm a Christian, and even I kept thinking to myself, who talks like this? Every time the lead guy referred to his dad as ""papa"" I cringed. What man in his 30's calls his dad papa? Maybe if you're 4 years old and living in the 1800's or very early 1900's, yes. But not today. There was just too much of the script like this that just didn't ring true, and it made me very annoyed with almost all of the Christian characters. They came across as people who are trying to sound Christian, but really aren't, which really didn't work for this movie because the main character is a girl who's pretending to be a Christian, so she can date a Christian guy and make him and the people in his social circle think she's a Christian. So not only does she seem like a fake Christian, but so do the people she's trying to fool.  I was curious to see how this movie would end, but I was just so fed up with the cheesy, intelligence insulting dialogue, and then the Christian Mingle commercial that comes on the TV in a scene  of the way through that I just gave up. It wasn't enough that the movie was called Christian Mingle. There had to be a full commercial in the movie too? This could have been a decent movie if it had gone light on the product placement and altogether avoided the forced cheesy Christian lingo. Too bad.",1424563200,6,1855,4.355491329479769
6789028,4,B00P826P1I,"I just joined Christian Mingle last moth and I found this movie to be quite cute. I have been a Christian for the past 32 years and  I actually dated a newly Christian young woman about 3 years ago and found that it is quite a challenge.  In order to form a good  relationship  you need to be  somewhat on the same level spirituality and scripturaly. I learned that if you plan to stick it out together,  the couple need to be patient not only with life challenges, but be willing to wait for the the young Christian to mature which only comes over time in getting to know  a living God and the scriptures. All and all, I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to any Christian singles.",1424304000,2,689,4.253846153846154
6789029,1,B00P826P1I,"It seems like Hollywood thinks if it's a Christian movie it has to be stupid and mindless. I'm really tired of watching cheesy, mind-numbing movies that are  labeled ""Christian!"" I have a brain AND am a Christian. The plot was a really good one. I have liked the actors in other roles. However, this movie makes Christians look so fake and hypocritical. The girl lying about being a Christian was supposed to be the fake one, yet every Christian in the whole movie appeared to be just as much or more fake. Morgan Fairchild as a Christian mom??? REALLY????Come on!!! The guy who was the love-interest came off as some kind of weird, in-genuine, unlikeable Richie Cunningham. The co-worker turned out to be  a closet Christian who lied to their boss to cover the main character going out of town. The main character never new that her co-worker was a Christian...hmm, wonder why? There was no chemistry or a sense of why the two people were attracted to each other. They were just boom in love.

The movie should have represented genuine Christians really living their faith so that the main character would see something in them that made her want to pursue a relationship with Christ. The message of how to come to know Christ as Savior should have been crystal clear--but no, there was talk of Jesus in driftwood & an epiphany during an experiment with cheese...weird. If the purpose of this movie was to waste over an hour of my time and to make me cringe at all the misconceptions of Christians portrayed here, then well done! Please give me something that makes me think, makes me want to be a better person, and doesn't leave me cringing!",1424044800,64,1644,4.642611683848798

But Christian Mingle is more than just a story about dating. Much more. It talks about many of the big questions of life, but it does so in a way that is entertaining, innocent, and disarming. This is one of those movies that you have some doubts about at first (like you are having right now as you read this), but just 10 minutes into it, you know you are in for something very special. You will not be disappointed, but you will be inspired and challenged. Highly recommended.",1423440000,16,599,4.504587155963303

If viewed as strictly a romance movie, I'll up it to two stars, but the acting was mostly bad and the comedy was too over-the-top and not that funny.
The voice over by Chabert purported to be telling the story of Gwen's journey to faith, but if that is what it was, it did a terrible job and didn't get the message right. In fact it didn't make Christians look good at all. Paul's friends were judgmental and self-righteous and the so-called mission trip accomplished nothing but moving some tires around (although maybe the bell did get hung).

6789062,2,B00P826P1I,"There are so many things wrong about this movie that it is hard to know where to begin.  To be fair, the movie does have brief moments where you see what the movie could have been, which just makes the rest of the movie seem, well, kind of phony.

Our hero is Gwyneth Hayden (Lacey Chabert, who is gorgeous, as always), who seems to be drifting through life.  She is looking for ""something,"" but she is kind of vague as to what ""something"" is.  Then she encounters the website for Christian Mingle, through which she meets Paul Wood (veteran actor Jonathan Patrick Moore).  The problem is that Gwyneth only pretends to be a practicing Christian, and she does it so poorly that it is hard to believe it took everyone else so long to see through her pretense, especially Paul.

Now, Paul's family and his wannabe girlfriend Kelly (actor Jill Saunders) are real pieces of work.  Sure, they do missions to Mexico where Paul's father has his company's name on all sorts of scripture around the Mexican village.  Sure, they go to church and are allegedly practicing Christians.  However, Paul and his family are incredibly judgmental and hypocritical to the point where I felt vomit in my throat the more they were in the movie.  Gwyneth got it right when she later tells Paul that she has found a church where she is more comfortable than with Paul's church.  Read, Gwyneth prefers people who really believe than a bunch of stuck-up upper middle class people who seem like Christians but make you suspect their belief is mostly on Sunday and the rest of the week they believe when they can advertise their belief.

I am going to try to avoid plot spoilers as much as I can, but I may give away some things to wrap up this review.

There is a major irony in this movie.  Gwyneth was looking for direction, and she found direction not in flashy works, and not in following a bunch of rules, but in being a real person doing real, Christian things.  Paul and his family, who seemed to be heavily invested in Christianity, instead end up seeming to be Christians in name, but so heavily critical of others that there is no way they really are Christians, in my opinion.  If this point was an intentional centerpiece of the movie, I wish it had not been.  The movie could have portrayed Paul and his family in a better light, with the point of contention being Gwyneth's deception.  But, Gwyneth was TRYING, and a Christian would understand that there are many paths to God.  Instead, Paul and his family had Gwyneth tried, convicted, and [figuratively] executed, without helping her find her way.  So terribly sad for viewers.

While I have trashed this movie pretty heavily, please note there are scenes that show what Christianity is all about.  There is the brief interaction between Gwyneth and her assistant Pam Thomas (actor Saidah Arrika Ekulona) that I will say little about but which is important, and portrayed well.  There is a scene where Gwyneth walks into a church where it says at the door that ALL ARE WELCOME!  See the contrast with Paul and his family, where it is clear that only those people who meet their criteria are welcome?  The best scenes of all are after Paul and his family are out of the picture, but I will say little about that, except one thing.  Paul finally seems to come to his senses.  Yes, it is ironic that the uber-Christian who had trouble with Gwyneth while she found her faith suddenly learned that maybe he had something to learn from Gwyneth about Christianity.

There are Christian oriented television shows that get it right.  Examples of such include ""Little House on the Prairie,"" ""Highway to Heaven,"" and ""Touched by an Angel.""  This movie is mostly so bad that it is excruciating to watch.  True Christians everywhere will watch this movie and just roll their eyes from despair.  Non-believers will watch and think this movie is representative of how Christians believe, and then they may feel glad they are not Christians.  How sad.

Good luck!",1483315200,,3987,4.664756446991404

6789091,1,B00P826P1I,"As both an unashamed Christian and an active contributor to the field of media production, I can rightfully state this is a terrible movie. In fact, it's one of the top 5 worst films I've ever watched.

Deceived by the ""good"" ratings, my friends and I were suscepted to 1 hour and 43 minutes of cringe-worthy acting captured by poorly-composed tripod shots, furthered by a predictable yet grudgingly slow plot line that inaccurately portrayed the truths and falsities of Christianity. While continuously laughing at elements of the horrible quality, we were unable to identify whether this film was supposed to be some sort of comedy, or if the writers were actually intentional. And in the end we were left with the taste that this film was planned to be taken seriously, falling so far from its purpose.

Unless, of course, their target audience was older individuals who don't care (or know) about tasteful, quality cinema and simply want to watch a movie with ""Christian"" in the title, this was yet another typical religious film.

While I'm sure the creators had the best of intentions, just not the best of writers (and other necessary resources), I'm tired of Believers putting out lousy movies which earn the Christian film industry a bad rap.

It was painful from beginning to end, but I put myself through it because I felt like I was learning about how the world views people like me, Christians, who find their spouse online.

Well.  First of all, it is apparent to me that the writers of this film are probably not Christians, as the portrayal of Christisn culture was way off-base. We don't all dress ultra boring, smile all the time and spout one liners that oversimplify the Christian life.  Christians can be deep thinkers who struggle with depression and anxiety. They aren't all perfect. we still struggle with sin. we aren't all from some 50s style cookie cutter.

The main character Gwyneth is a girl who is desperate to get married, to a pathetic extent. She is not very genuine which makes the movie pretty painful to watch. She's not a deep thinker, even when she ""meets Jesus"".

The movie is cheesy, low-budget, predictable in every way.

As a Christian, it really bothered me that the movie spent so much time talking about how various characters ""found Jesus"" yet said nothing profound or legitimately plausible to those of us who know what it is to actually have real faith in God. No talk about God's character drawing people in.  For a movie about a bunch of Christians and a girl who becomes one- a shocking lack of the actual gospel (realization of sin, need for a Savior, repentance).  It's all protrayed as just a ""journey to find Jesus"" that sounds disgustingly similar to the way a person my talk about their weight loss journey or their journey as a contestant on ""The Bachelor"".  Some nondescript emotional ride. In a sequence where we watch the main character ""come to Jesus"" we watch her cry and yell out to God out her window in response to the weather. It all seems like something someone would make up based on what they think Christians must experience. Gwyneth is trying to convince Paul she's a real Christian for most of this movie. Meanwhile the writers try to convince us they have some understanding of what it means to be a Christian. If you are one, you won't buy it.",1466208000,4,2226,4.57286432160804

But nope, their weird first meeting was supposed to be romantic, I guess, because they hit it off so well--um, ok.
As their relationship continues, I couldn't help but think how awkward they were together, how unromantic, how they had no sparks. But somehow the writers thought it was working on screen? The guy is so stiff, he looks about 14, and his family and friends are awful representations of Christians.
I find it interesting that a website like Christian Mingle, in which this entire movie was basically an infomercial for, would want Christians portrayed in such a stuffy, old-fashioned, and cheesy way--not a great way to steer people toward their website. The only fun-loving, cool character was the non-Christian, until she finds a church that is as cool and hip as she is. Oh, and then there is the co-worker who tells nobody about her faith, even after knowing them for years because it is ""not her style.""
The ""other woman""--the Christian girl that was supposed to end up with the guy, comes off as catty and fake. And the mother is about the same. The dad seems sweet and genuine, but overly zealous to the point of coming across as cult-ish.
And the guy that our main character falls in love with does not seem to be lead by the Lord, but by his mother. He is even called out on it, but the message is one of ""do what YOU want, not what others want you to do,"" instead of what does the Lord want you to do.
This movie is just wrong on so many levels. The romance is completely lacking, the Christianity is completely lacking, and the gospel message about finding salvation in a piece of wood? How sad. She is even told by her co-worker (when she finally finds out her co-worker is a Christian) that as much as she thinks she is ""there,"" she's not ""there yet."" This is a horrible way to confuse people about the gospel. Salvation is not a journey, and there is nothing one can do to obtain it other than accept it. The movie vaguely implies that a person has to somehow ""find it."" What pathetic rubbish.
If I were single, after watching this movie, I would stay far away from the Christian Mingle website. I would not want to find a straight-laced boyish-looking guy with a fake and stuffy family. So thanks, Christian Mingle, for the heads up!

6789130,3,B00P826P1I,"Christmas/Easter Christian living her ""ideal life"" in LA with her cute outfits, in her trendy apartment, in her trendy LA neighborhood realizes in her 30s that she has had no meaningful relationships. She starts to question her life. Out of desperation to meet the right guy she signs up for Christian Mingle. Meets a very good looking, sane, normal, boyish charming guy. She falls for him but as she does the problem of her not ""really"" being a Christian . . . a practicing one . . . like him . . . weighs on her and their relationship. She is finally exposed.

The movie has a great message. Find God and you will find peace and a great life. But I think it touches upon something else that I personally had an issue with--I don't think Christians teach people how to date and shop around for someone. As a result we go through so much in the dating world with the wrong people. Our ideas of who is someone to go after or be sought after are usually shaped by TV and movies which is completely wrong. So we end up miserable. We end up putting our faith in danger. Anyway this movie touches upon that too.

I would have given this movie more stars as it is a decent movie if it were not for two things: 1) most Christian mainstream movies are so focused on the writers personal beliefs/point that that they want to get across the craft of telling it in a movie suffers. I find them too abrupt. They go from hi to married and happily ever after without the build up that the story telling/showing delivers. Maybe they should have artistic control over someone with a more developed craft doing the actual job. I know they feel that their message would be muddle or corrupted. But maybe with final say you could prevent that. and 2) that actress reminds me of Reese Witherspoon sucking her teeth in her ""like""'s and ""you know""'s. I have grown to hate that in young women.

The other way this movie portrays Christians is as people who often seem scared or ashamed to live their faith in real-time (on-the-job, with friends that aren't believers).  The last, and seemingly the most insignificant, way that the movie portrays Christians is as people who have joy, love God and others, and put their trust in God's word.

6789214,3,B00P826P1I,"Wow, some of these reviews...  If you expected a movie named after a dating website to have the depth/layers of a Bergman or even a Sherwood Pictures film, it's hard to know what to tell you.  I only bought it because it had a premise with possibilities (a non-Christian woman pretends to be a Christian to meet nicer guys).  I liked it better than I expected to, it contained interesting commentary about (my fellow) American Christians, like the kinds of places we go to eat after church, for example.  Of course, when you have a story about a non-Christian coming into the world of a believer, there are a lot of comedic possibilities.  The way Gwyneth dressed, the way she prayed, the way she quoted scripture were good for a few laughs.  One critique I will make is that she and Paul sounded to much alike.  Their voices weren't unique even though they were two different people from two very different backgrounds.

Was it blatant evangelism?  No, and I don't think every Christian film should have to be.  Some films can and should be just for us, if for no other reason to give us an alternative to the Babylon film selection.  I think the Christian film industry is going to get better, much like the Christian music industry did (I remember in my punk rock days, where my friends were desperately inviting me to Amy Grant concerts or hoping in vain that I'd like their Rez Band albums... now there are plenty of Christian bands of all styles of music imaginable) and I'm willing to be patient while it grows.  And actually in some ways, I think we the audience are holding the industry back. Pure Flix used to make deep films like Hidden Secrets, but the audience for the less deep God's Not Dead was much bigger.",1430352000,,1723,4.540453074433657

6789227,3,B00P826P1I,"If you are expecting a movie the same caliber of ""Courageous"" or ""Fireproof,"" you'll be disappointed.  After reading author Corbin Bernsen's religious views, I now understand why this movie is so superficial.  True faith goes beyond an acknowledgement that God and Christ exist.  ""Even the demons believe and shudder"" (James 2:19).  In ""Christian Mingle,"" there is no authentic demonstration of faith beyond a belief that God exists.  While in the beginning the main character bluffs her way through so-called Christianity, true Christianity is depicted as a ""In Jesus' name"" ending to prayer or an occasional ""Praise the Lord!""  We never see a conversion of the heart. In the film, Christianity looks like something you do on Sunday rather than something you ARE.

As for the plot, the ending comes rather abruptly.  There seems to be a huge gap between the two last scenes, as if the author just gave up writing the story.  There are a few funny moments, and that is the only reason I gave the movie three stars.",1426032000,18,1014,4.883040935672515

6789232,4,B00P826P1I,"I liked this better than the OK Cupid movie and even ""JDate 3: Parting of the Sheets"". These Christian minglers put you on a suspenseful thrill-ride, wondering at all times if the leading lady can truly embrace Christianity and find love in the end! You may find some of the scenes a bit racy, until she starts going to church and covering up her body as God intended.

I'd say this was a 5-Star movie experience, but unfortunately I rented it while my good-for-nothing ex Carla was using my motel room to smoke drugs with a bunch of her so-called friends. They seemed to have some real problems with the characters and action in the flick. But contrary to their opinions, this movie does NOT revolve around the Vatican and a secret colony of winged beasts. Don't let Carla or Two-Finger Tony tell you otherwise.

This is just a good wholesome film about the exciting world of Christian dating, which I hope to soon be a part of. Any takers???",1424822400,9,943,4.541176470588235
8686804,5,B00P826P1I,"I know it is a little on the cheesy side, and entirely predictable, but I love the movie Christian Mingle because, while it us a romance, it is more about the protagonist, Gwyneth, finding God and changing her life for the better.  In the film Gwyneth pretends to be Christian so she can find a good man, but when it is found out that she is faking it her new boyfriend, Paul, breaks up with her. After getting dumped Gwyneth then gets serious about the things she was pretending to to believe and finds God for real and decided to follow Jesus, even if she never finds the man of her dreams. Spoiler alert, at a later date Gwyneth and Paul get back together, but now their relationship is based on truth and in a shared love for God instead of falsehoods and deception.",1532822400,,770,4.347222222222222

8686808,5,B00P826P1I,"If you are looking for a sweet, innocent and very funny Christian movie you can't go wrong with this one. It is simply a story of a woman who wants to get married and pretends to be a Christian so she can meet a man on a Christian dating site. The problem is she doesn't exactly know much about how to act as a Christian. She buys a book called ""Christianity for Dummies"" and tries her best. The guy she is dating is fooled for a long time. His mother however has a different opinion. If you are a Christian you will probably find this very amusing. I laughed several times and really enjoyed how cute this was. There are so few movies that show a more innocent side of dating. This was refreshing and I can see myself watching it again sometime.
