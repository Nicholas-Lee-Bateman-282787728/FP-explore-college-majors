4885736,5,B005SJXAVO,"I am a Service Member currently deployed in Afghanistan. The Chaplain service used this for one of our Bible study classes where we watched an episode once a week. All attends (High ranking Military officers and enlisted members from several nations) were impact by the compelling truth displayed in this series. At the end of each section, we did not want to conclude the study because the message in each episode allowed us to examine ourselves and our current relationship with Jesus. We wanted to continue our discussions but we need to get back to work.  Examples used in this Series will clearly reveal to you where you stand. I will make sure my Men's Ministry at my church back in the US has a taste of this beautiful truth.",1385596800,2,732,4.630769230769231
4885737,5,B005SJXAVO,"This is an absolutely wonderful movie and bible study.  It is one that will make you re-evaluate your life and your life lived for the Lord.  We just finished this at our church and everyone loved it.  This is not your typical bible study, probably one of the best I have done.",1382227200,,277,4.288461538461538
4885738,5,B005SJXAVO,"We watched this movie at our church, I was so touched by this movie I had to buy it. I know I will watch this movie many times.",1381622400,,127,3.5714285714285716

4885740,5,B005SJXAVO,"What a beautiful show that depicts on a daily basis how we are meant to glorify the Lord JESUS CHRIST who gave himself for us that we may live a victorious life just as he did. Who is the only potentate KINGS OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS. I cried heavily when the main actors funeral was being held. I don't know the actor in real life what hes like but according to the story, this is christianity.",1376006400,,397,4.102564102564102
4885741,5,B005SJXAVO,"A friend lent this movie to me, and I just finished watching it.  Besides being moved to tears, I was left with a lot to contemplate, which is what the movie intends for every viewer.  Real life teaching minister Kyle Idlemann poses the question to you...""Are you a follower of Jesus?""  He asks you to take time to think carefully before answering that question. Is it possible we don't really know what Jesus is asking of us when he wants us to be a completely committed follower who is willing to give up everything...not just a ""fan"" who puts limits on what he/she is willing to do for Him?

The movie is about a man, Eric Nelson, who leads a somewhat typical life...businessman, fun seeker, part-time Jesus fan.  He almost loses his life and feels God has given him a second chance.  He becomes convicted to take up his cross and follow Jesus.  The narrator (Kyle Idlemann) describes what that REALLY means.  What will you do when your family questions your decision?  Some people may realize that they have been a ""fan"" of Jesus...not a true follower.  Afterall, do we really want God in EVERY aspect of our lives, or as the narrator states...are there ""doors"" that we keep shut and locked and don't want Jesus to have access to?  Are we really ready to give up our worldly goods and give our lives totally to Him?  And are we doing it for the right reason...LOVE?

The story is told in flashbacks and real time.  It comes across as a sermon/message, and yet Kyle Idlemann makes you feel like he is your best friend...sharing the truth and wanting you to honestly ask yourselves these important questions.  His sincerity comes through.  Long-time believers, new believers, and non-believers alike will be left with much to think about.

This DVD is an 80-minute excerpt from the full story that is included in a 6-part small group study offer.  That doesn't mean that this movie lacks anything or that it doesn't offer a complete message, because it certainly does.  As a matter of fact, I didn't even realize there was more to the story until after the movie had ended and there was sort of an advertisement for the rest of the story in group study format.  Although I do think this would make an excellent small group study, don't let that keep you from buying this shortened version; the message is loud and clear.",1363737600,18,2322,4.603406326034063
4885742,5,B005SJXAVO,"Good choice to accompany the book, the study, or simply to pique the interest.",1468540800,,78,4.642857142857143
4885743,3,B005SJXAVO,"i did the study and i thought this was going to be like just a continuous movie of the study with more in it.  it was the actual opposite.  the study clips were MORE detailed and this movie left out many things.  if you did the study and then watched this, you will be disappointed.",1467849600,3,282,4.090909090909091

4885748,5,B005SJXAVO,"Wonderful movie.  First viewed it at a movie night at our church.  Left weeping and asking myself a lot of pointed questions-- really affected me and I can't quit thinking about it.  Decided I wanted to purchase it so I could share it with friends and family who may think they're a follower when in reality, they are just a fan.  It's important that we know what Jesus wants and expects from us -- this movie helped clear that up for me. We have to take our relationship with Jesus seriously -- we cannot just spend time with Him when it's convenient for us.  He has to be first.  Thank you Kyle Idleman for this wonderful movie.",1447891200,2,630,4.3418803418803416

4885762,3,B005SJXAVO,"Apparently there are 2 versions of this. 1 is this specific movie and the other is a 6 part bible study movie, which is only smiliar in a few parts. It looks like the bible study version has more to it and completes the story, whereas this is a pretty sloppy throw together of some key points with no real content to piece it together. All in all its an ok movie, but if you have the option to get the bible study version I would recommend that one.",1419033600,7,449,4.056179775280899

4885767,5,B005SJXAVO,"One of THE best books I've ever read. Really asks the question what it REALLY means to be a follower, to be a true Christ like example. Made me take a long, hard look at myself.

8485221,5,B005SJXAVO,It's the type of movie that Christians or church goin' folks should see. So many times I see people at concerts or sporting events that scream so much an so loud they lose their voice. In church during worship they're almost silent. If you can cheer for a team like that. I'm not saying you shouldn't cheer your team. Keep in mind God is the one who gave you the ability to use your voice. He is responsible for everything in your being. Give Him the praise that is due to Him,1510272000,,476,4.184782608695652
