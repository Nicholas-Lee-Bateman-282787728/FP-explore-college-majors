1901670,5,B0000A2ARZ,"I thought this video, Follow Jade, was the best Chinese Children's Video that I've seen to date. I have purchased others and they fail in comparison. I hope Jade Qian will continue to make more lessons available on tape.",1082937600,,220,4.666666666666667
1901671,2,B0000A2ARZ,"The instructor was pleasant and charistmatic.  She used props in many cases to illustrate her points about the parts of the body, names of fruits and animals, etc.  There is a little clapping game at the end which was fun.
However, this video didn't strongly appeal to me or my 2-year old.  The majority of the video is presented in a classroom-ish manner:  the instructor held up different fruits, animals, etc, and named them in Chinese.  Then she drilled the audience on the names again.  I guess the drills were game-like, but didn't seem too engaging.  The video did not have stories, drama, music, etc. to keep my child interested.  He has not wanted to watch it again after the first time.
Much of the spoken language on the video is in English.  Given that my child is 2 years old, I think a total-immersion approach would be more effective.  I also noticed that sometimes the instructor would use a Chinese word in an English sentance, and would not pronounce that Chinese word with the correct tone.  I think this model could be confusing to kids.",1062115200,6,1057,4.629032258064516
1901672,5,B0000A2ARZ,The DVD is great! Jade speaks authetic chinese and my two daughters really love it!,1232236800,,83,4.6
1901673,4,B0000A2ARZ,"I am an adoptive father of a daughter from Anhui, China. I have the Jade videos to try to help us learn some Chinese. My daughter enjoys the Jade videos. Thanks to this one she can count to 10 in Chinese. I just wish there were more videos in the series than just two.",1195516800,,268,3.9814814814814814
1901674,5,B0000A2ARZ,"The Follow Jade dvd's are great. There are two, one going to Kindergarten, and one going to the market. Only thing is that she teaches you the name of the fruits, but doesn't teach you how to ask for it in a sentence. Hope she expands on that with more dvd's.

Also, the mei mei dvd's are great.  Her songs are very catchy and my kids loves singing along with her.

Plus, we also bought this gorgerous ""ASIAN AMERICAN BERENGUER GIRL DOLL"" from EBAY, and my daughter absolutely loves to play with the beautiful doll and watch her Chinese dvd's.

Highly recommend.",1174953600,,562,4.480392156862745
1901675,5,B0000A2ARZ,"My 4-year old and I both like this DVD. It covers fruit names, animals and parts of the body. Some will say this is not much for the money. Some may also say the quality is not as good as Disney. But the video creates a warm and comfortable environment for the younger learners. Clean, light and fun. Jade is an excellent teacher speaking great mandarin Chinese (and English). The ""theme song"" - (in Chinese)""1,2,3,4,5,6,7, where are my friends...""- is a big draw for kids first learning Chinese. Some other rhymes are also very memorable. Great pacing and many reinforcements.

I saw some comments regarding Chinese learning videos' variable sound volume when real people speaking Chinese. And I smile, because that is exactly what Chinese is. The Chinese phonetics varies a lot more than English. It is a lot less ""sing-songy"". If you learn Chinese the ""pronouced"" way - to pronouce every character by the right tone and length, you would be ""reading in monotone"" , not ""talking"". I agree you probably should start learning this way, but it is through subtle variations of tone, length and volume that you deliver this most complex language of its true meaning.",1174348800,3,1163,4.844221105527638
1901676,4,B0000A2ARZ,"Follow Jade is a very good way of discovering the Chinese language. It is also a good teaching support for students, though it is a bit expensive (30 minutes). As a private tutor, I bought it to help my students who are beginners and it really helped them, since it is very entertaining, they learn a lot without realising it.",1173398400,2,326,4.45
1901677,5,B0000A2ARZ,"We love this DVD!  Jade laoshi is a big hit at our house and ""Let's Go To Market"" is my child's favorite.  It covers lots of the important toddler words, like parts of the face/body, animal names, fruit names, and a couple of songs.  ""Visit a Kindergarten"" is also good and covers counting, colors, weather, and songs.  Neither of these DVDs are Disney quality production, but the material and the teacher are both very good for the younger kids.  Way more age appropriate than something like Muzzy.  I would recommend this for many different types of Chinese learners including Bi-national families trying to learn each others languages.  Jade's teaching style is good for teaching some English to Chinese speaking children.",1169164800,7,725,4.991666666666666
1901678,5,B0000A2ARZ,"We have both of the Follow Jade DVD's.  They are fantastic.  She repeats the words alot and in different settings.  Too bad that they are only the words, and she doesn't teach you how to ask for it in a sentence.  Hopefully, she will expand and create more dvd's.

I also recommend the Mei Mei dvd's, too.  They're great, too.  The songs are very catchy.

Plus, we also bought this gorgerous ""ASIAN AMERICAN BERENGUER GIRL DOLL"" from EBAY, and my daughter absolutely loves to play with the beautiful doll and watch her Chinese dvd's.",1151280000,6,533,4.595744680851064
1901679,4,B0000A2ARZ,"My [...] loves this video and has learned many new words.  The format is constantly teaching new words - not just a few words sprinkled through.  Jade is a teacher (I'd say in her 20s) and she starts at a Chinese market and points/holds to types of foods and names them and then moves on to body parts and farm animals.  The word is also written in Chinese on the screen.  She then reviews them in a quiz format with children and then in a game format with pictures or toys.  I don't speak Chinese, so I don't know if there are any errors in the tape or not.  The last section has children singing songs with Chinese in at least part of them.  Some of the songs just have a few Chinese words in them and others are all Chinese.  The video is interactive and educational.  I'm anxiously looking forward to the Jade Kindergarten video now that we've seen this one.

There are a couple negatives:  it is sometimes hard to hear some of the kids speak as it is softer and not as clear; the barnyard scene goes fast, but she does do a good job reviewing them later; and a couple of the visual aids are a little hard to tell what they are.  Still, I recommend this video - these are really minor flaws when you view the whole video.  It is short (about 30 minutes), but all my [...] should watch at one sitting anyway.",1146441600,16,1311,4.196
1901680,4,B0000A2ARZ,"It appears that some reviewers are expecting Hollywood production when purchasing videos for learning Chinese - both by Jade and by Mei Mei and then they feel dreadfully disappointed when they find out that's not the case.

Nevertheless, if your purpose for buying these videos is to learn few basic words and expressions in Chinese - the videos will help you to do just that.

The songs in Jade's videos have mixed English and Chinese words.

The videos are made for kids, but I purchased them nevertheless when I was learning my first words in Chinese, together with many other programs and the songs had enough of catchy tunes that the words and tunes stuck in my mind even a year later without go back over those programs.

And as the other reviewer noted, it's a good idea to visit Chinasprouts - there have a great selection of videos and books to help children learn Chinese.",1098662400,3,882,4.634615384615385
1901681,5,B0000A2ARZ,"I have two kids who are half Chinese and half American, and are interested in learning Chinese.  A friend told us about this ""follow jade"" series.  We first borrowed it from the liabrary, and it was a hit in the family!  The kids started to say things like ""what is your name"", ""how old are you"" in Chinese just like Jade, and answer back with each other just like the kids in the video.  It was so sweet to see that!  I am just so happy to see them finally getting into Chinese with excitement.

The video is not all Chinese (that would not really work), it is spaced nicely with English and Chinese, making the Chinese very visible and easy to remember. Some people might not get used to it at the beginning.  I thought it was very different at first, because it is not the usual way of teaching.  But it works like a charm!  I would encourage everyone to try it.

I also like the real market scenes in China, the color, the sound, it really makes you feel China and want to practice your Chinese.  I highly recommend the two Follow Jade videos to anyone.  The Kindergarden one has more songs and basic  words, the Market one has a bit extended vocabs.  Try them!",1094860800,4,1165,4.284403669724771
7995718,5,B0000A2ARZ,"I am so pleased with this DVD!!  My daughters 5&6 love it and have learned so much Mandarin using this DVD and the other DVD in this series!  They have beautiful accents, the love and enjoy the language.  I bought this because they are entering a school in which the students study Mandarin and we have discovered that after watching these 2 DVDs, my daughters know more Mandarin and have a much better accent than the students at the school who have been studying for years.  (yes, this worries me about the school, but the DVDs are great!!",1470096000,,541,4.489795918367347
7995719,1,B0000A2ARZ,There is not much to learn here.  The vocabularies are too simple and so limited in this DVD.  A two year old will get bored of this quickly.,1467504000,,141,4.0
7995720,5,B0000A2ARZ,"Jade is a very good teacher and unlike some total emersion videos, she speaks English along with Mandarin.  She's very easy to understand! My kids love it and so do I.  Be forewarned, if you have a problem with words like ""gee"" and ""gosh,"" she does say ""Oh my gosh"" once or twice but overall a great educational tool!  I wish there were more than two videos.",1453161600,,358,4.313432835820896
7995721,4,B0000A2ARZ,"I like that the host, Jade, does a lot of repetition of words in different ways. It's also shot in China, so my students could see what a part of China looks like. My only suggestion is she could use more Mandarin when giving simple instructions that are repeated throughout the show. She only speaks Mandarin when teaching the new words.",1449705600,,338,4.557377049180328
7995722,5,B0000A2ARZ,Excellent.,1414108800,,10,10.0
7995723,4,B0000A2ARZ,"My wife wants my daughter to learn Chinese. She takes Chinese lessons from a younger girl in our neighborhood, and also watches ""Ni Hao Kai lan"", which is similar to ""Dora the Explorer"", and ""Go Diego Go"" in format, how it attempts to teach some token Spanish words, similar in production value, which is quite low when compared to a show like ""Little Bear"" where scenes are lovingly hand drawn and hand colored, with original musical scores, good voice acting, humor that is funny to both her and me, and morals that apply to real life.. contrasted against finding a gooey geyser, so they can get to the muddy road, where the muddy mud puddle spits upside down trees at fish swimming in a cloud.

Jade at least, is better than that in my opinion. It follows a more classroom like approach to learning, for better or worse, showing a familiar object, saying it's English name, and then saying it's Chinese name. My daughter has actually learned some words thanks to that approach, but it doesn't hold her attention long. Jade enunciates English words poorly. The musical score is an almost eerie drone.

Take it for what it's worth. I got it for around $5. It's hard to find educational material that is quality, especially as it relates to children and foreign languages. I'm giving it 4 stars only because of it's ""originality"", being one of only two programs I know of that present Chinese at an early age to kids in a format they can understand.",1327017600,,1449,4.634241245136187
7995724,1,B0000A2ARZ,"The picture quality is fine, but the audio quality is really bad. There's a lot of back ground sounds and you can barely hear what Jade is talking about. I read the reviews thinking it would be good for my kids to watch this in my min-van, I first thought it was the head phones, but I switch out the video with another movie and it was pretty obvious that the sound quality was poor.

Can't learn anything if you can't hear her. I tried to return this video, but I miss my windows by 2 days :(",1312416000,,494,4.040816326530612
7995725,4,B0000A2ARZ,"Bought this for my 2 year old. I think whoever editted the DVD, and Jade herself were trying too hard to squeeze everything every word in the shortest time possible. The pause between some words were not long enough for kids to repeat and then another word is spoken. Quite disappointing if you ask me, esp for adults. Kids learn a lot faster, but adults need a few more seconds of processing.

Quality of DVD is fine. Some scenes really go too fast. I just don't understand why they cannot spare 3 more minutes for the entire DVD, so for some people who do not know Chinese at all, watching or listening to this DVD won't make them feel like they are dealing with non stop screeching sound from the TV.

Otherwise my 2 year old daughter truly enjoys the DVD. I grew up learning Mandarin (traditional and simplified) and I think a few of the words Jade used were not quite correct. Such as the word ""Purple"", it can be pronounced ""Zi Se"" which is more appropriate instead of ""Zi Yan Se""... Ohh well, it's not a big deal I hope.

I also feel the DVD is slightly overpriced for the length of time and amount of vocabulary. I want to try ""Mei Mei"" DVD and see how I like it.",1306281600,2,1171,4.2657657657657655
7995726,1,B0000A2ARZ,"I bought Jade when my son was just under 2.  He loved her.  If you're looking for an electronic baby-sitter, this will work for you.  However, if you were hoping that your child would learn or maintain language skills, this will not help at all.  Jade speaks primarily in English, with occasional Mandarin vocabulary words thrown in.  But no one learns a language by hearing single words in isolation!  This is absolutely useless for language learning.  But (as I said) my son really did like it, so it made some long plane flights a lot more manageable.",1286236800,3,554,4.649484536082475
7995727,5,B0000A2ARZ,"Both of my children (ages 3 and 5) love the Follow Jade DVDs.  I have found that they have learned much more  Chinese from Follow Jade than any other DVD that we have tried.  Even their Chinese teachers at school were impressed by how they knew all their colors, fruits and more - all from watching Follow Jade.  We would love to see more DVDs and are hoping that there will be more someday!",1255824000,,391,4.243243243243243
