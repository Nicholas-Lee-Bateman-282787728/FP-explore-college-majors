8099960,4,B000CPH9ZW,"This volume contains episodes 21-23.  It's getting close now, close to the truth.  This volume is called Sacifice and rightfully so.  It has a very emotional ending, however I do not want to give away what happens.  I give it 4 stars because one of my favorite charaters will no longer be in the show.  It's kinda sad and unexpected.  At least it was for me,- still a very good series.  If you've already started it, by all means continue it.  You'll be glad that you did.",1146182400,,472,4.344827586206897
