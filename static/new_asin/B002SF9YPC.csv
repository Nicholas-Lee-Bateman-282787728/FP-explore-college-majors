8523932,1,B002SF9YPC,"I purchased this DVD for my niece who saw the Library episode on TV a while ago. She was going through and sea life obsession, and loved the song Tracy and Jay Jay sing with the whale. So, I purchased the DVD when I found it on amazon, however, much to our disappointment, when we watched the episode the song was completely edited out of the episode! Major bummer since that was the reason I bought it. She has never watched it again.",1291420800,,435,4.253012048192771
