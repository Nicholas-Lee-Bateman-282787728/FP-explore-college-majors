1593919,5,B00005JOYL,"Before you watch this movie make sure to snap out of FOX-induced expectations :) This is not another dracula/buffy clone. This movie follows original story based on a book with same name released in Russia few years ago. If you watch it only for the horrow/action part you will miss alot. Follow the story carefully as every detail in the movie is important.

One warning though - don't get FOX's ""castrated"" version of this movie - get an original DVD (it has English subs and scenes that FOX cut out) If you are to watch the theatrical US release version you will miss alot. That every detail and scenes that buid up for a part 2 and finale I mention are in part taken out so when you watch the movie you are forced to ginish a puzzle with missing pieses.",1144108800,,757,4.368794326241135
1593920,5,B00005JOYL,"Living in Seattle, I saw the preview for Nochnoi dozor (Night Watch) in early June of 2005. The first time I saw the preview, I thought I needed to see it. The date, naturally for an independent film, was pushed back so far that I had to wait until February to see it. When I learned it had finally came out, I rushed to the theater in Seattle and saw it for a school project. I went into the theater nervous and excited, and I left it astounded.

This movie is one of those over-satisfying movies, for those of you who like independent films. You see the preview, you wanna see it... and it turns out to be greater than you imagined. I proceeded to see it again when it came to a local theater, and I plan on seeing it one more time before it dissappears into the world of DVDs.

Sure, it is a complicated movie that is hard to understand for those who don't like to think very hard. But it just clicks... and it is just one of those beautifully amazing films. Two thumbs up and more if I had more than two...

Go see it!",1142294400,2,1022,4.1
1593921,3,B00005JOYL,"Nochnoi Dozor (Timur Bekmambetov, 2004)

As we were driving to the theatre to see this, the chap I was with said he'd read of Timur Bekmambetov being referred to as ""the Russian Roger Corman."" My response: ""cue the animatronic spiders."" I didn't know how right I was.

There is a shaky truce between the powers of light and the powers of darkness, reached after a long, very bloody battle over a bridge. For some reason, the powers of light and darkness, in the present day, both live and work in Moscow rather than worldwide. In the opening sequences of the movie, we meet Anton Gorodetsky (Sky. Plane. Girl.'s Konstantin Khabensky), just a regular guy until he's drafted into the Others' war through no fault of his own. Fast forward to 2004. Gorodetsky is twelve years older, and a foot soldier in Light's service. He gets an assignment from above to hunt down a pair Darks who are planning to kill a kid. He attempts to complete the mission and fails rather spectacularly, setting in motion events so monumental that his only solace is that things would have been a lot worse had he succeeded...

There's a great, great premise here, and isolated pieces of the movie are done well. The screenplay, when it's not bogged down in its own sludge, is quite interesting, even if it's nakedly manipulative. But the little things-- you know, the ones the song says mean a lot-- will likely drive the viewer to distraction. Annoying overdone camerawork hasn't been this in style since Irreversible, and Night Watch does it even worse. The music is interesting at times, weirdly inappropriate in others. Some characters do their jobs well, others are either horribly acted, horribly written, or both.

In short: it's a half-decent movie that could have been good, maybe even great. It manipulated me into wanting to see the second movie in the trilogy with a cliffhanger ending, but I think I'll wait for the DVD. ** ",1142208000,,1911,4.761329305135952
1593922,4,B00005JOYL,"""Night Watch"" (""Nochnoi Dozor""), a new Russian film, blends elements of horror, thriller and fantasy creating a truly different story. The first entry of a proposed trilogy, ""Night Watch"" is a visually interesting, imperfect film. As the story progresses, through two more films, I anticipate many more layers of story, character and action will be revealed based on the promise of this first entry.

In 1992, Anton (Konstantin Kabensky) visits a local `witch'. He wants the woman to help him win his estranged pregnant wife back; she recently left him and he is having trouble coping with the loss. The `witch' tells Anton that she can help him, but his wife's illegitimate child will be lost. He consents. Before the meeting ends, Anton will learn he is an ""Other"", one of a group of creatures who help keep the balance between good and evil. Twelve years later, Anton has joined the Night Watch, the group of Others who oversee the night, and all things light and good. This group spar with Day Watch, the Others who protect all things bad or dark. Oh, and Anton is now a vampire.

I could go on and on, describing every aspect of this tale, such as the shape shifters, a cursed woman who could unknowingly cause the Apocalypse, vampires hunting a twelve year old boy, and more. But if I did so, a lot of the surprise, magic and interest in the tale would be lost. A large part of our ability to suspend disbelief rides on our ability to be surprised. If you aren't surprised, you are probably anticipating something and comparing it to real life. It is better for you to be surprised.

On paper, it sounds like a mess, but strangely, oddly, inconceivably, it works. While far from a perfect film, the alternate universe created here is well-defined and makes sense based on the parameters established by the writer and director Timur Bekmambetov. Clearly, ""Watch"" isn't going to depict a real time and place. But the director establishes this time and place well. There are moments which don't make sense, detracting from the overall quality of the project, but these are few and far between.

Given the circumstances, all of the characters are suitably dour and depressed. Locked in an epic battle, I imagine they have little time for fun or jokes. Anton is a particularly interesting character. As a vampire, he would naturally need blood in order to survive. But as he is a member of the Night Watch, he seems determined to drink pig blood, staying away from humans, something the vampires of Day Watch have no trouble with. As he struggles with this seemingly self-enforced character trait, he serves as a sort of foot soldier for his group, helping them find people, dealing with problems. His current assignment is to help them find a 12 year old boy who is receiving the calling, from the Day Watch to come and join them. Of course, the little boy has no idea what that means, but the Night Watch have to stop him before he makes it.

Because the film was shot in Russia, the settings are unique and foreign, adding to the `alternate reality' view they present. Because the typical Russian lives in conditions a couple of grades below what most of us are used to, this adds to the feel of the film, giving the characters more desperation, less comfort. They live in small, dark, cluttered apartments. If the power goes out, they simply adapt because they are used to it. It doesn't even occur to them that the power outage might be a sign of something more serious. They drive old cars and trucks. There clothes are dark and slightly worn out. To us, everything people living in Moscow deal with on a daily basis seems like a prop or set decoration in a film about the Apocalypse.

Director Bekmambetov has occasional flashes of brilliance. In one scene, Anton finds himself battling two vampires from the Day Watch for the 12 year old boy. These Day Watch vampires can only be seen consistently in mirrors. But when the one large mirror in the old warehouse is broken, Anton can no longer see the male who is attacking him. He grabs a large shard of mirror and holds it close to his face, swirling around, looking for his attacker. This scene is quite interesting, almost brilliant in execution. One problem with the film is some of the guidelines established are inconsistent. Later, the female vampire is seen without the aid of mirrors.

Less successful are scenes of the leader of the Day Watch using a video game for training purposes. Images of the video game are cut into scenes of the leader practicing sword moves. The figures in the video game look remarkably similar to this character and it almost seems like a plug for a video game tie in. Unfortunately, the game is featured a few times, detracting from the film.

As this is a Russian film, there are subtitles. For the American release, Fox Searchlight has added an English language introduction and coda, to help orient the viewers. Also, many of the subtitles seem to be integrated into the image. For instance, when the 12 year old boy hears the calling, the subtitles mysteriously drift away, much like the woman's voice he hears. It's a nice touch.

This is a film that will require you to suspend disbelief. If you are willing to do that, you should enjoy the ride. If you are expecting to watch a realistic drama featuring recognizable American actors, you will be disappointed.",1141948800,2,5363,4.6847133757961785
1593923,3,B00005JOYL,"Night Watch has a very interesting story and characters but the movie makers didn't put it well together. There are a bunch of different stories in the movie that have no connection like the damned lady, the vampiress, the young boy.....the movie is hard to follow. Hopefully the next two parts will be better.",1141603200,,310,4.7592592592592595
1593924,3,B00005JOYL,"Nighwatch is the first part in a dark fantasy trilogy out of Russia.  The basic backstory to the film is that the forces of Dark and Light have had a Truce ever since an ancient battle where both sides realized neither could defeat the other.  The Truce involves both sides keeping the other ""in check.""  The forces of Light, called the Nightwatch, are supposed to make sure no Dark Others break the Truce.  The same is true for the forces of Dark, who are called the Daywatch.  The film opens with a flashback of our main character, Anton, who is a seer, and he is employing a woman to get his woman back for him and give her a miscarriage.  The forces of Light stop the woman from completing the miscarriage, and this is when Anton first finds out that he is an Other, and can see the forces of Light and Dark as they truly are.  Flash forward twelve years, and Anton is now a full-fledged member of the Nightwatch, which is run by Gesser, who has been the leader of the forces of Light for all of time.  The real story of the film starts when Anton is given an assignment to stop a twelve-year old boy from succumbing to ""the Call,"" which is what vampires use to lure their victims into a trap and suck their blood.  On his assignment, Anton comes across a woman with a ""vortex"" around her.  He is later told that this woman is ""the virgin,"" and her return signals that the final battle between Light and Dark is about to take place, with the balance changing forever.  Another part of this prophecy involves the coming of an Other who is more powerful than any other ever before.  This Other must choose between Light and Dark, as all must, and the side he chooses will decide which side will win the last battle.

Okay, now that that has all been said, I hope everyone is still with me as to what is going on.  The film is very convoluted and tough to follow.  There is a whole lot that goes totally unexplained throughout the whole movie, and I guess that is to be expected if you view the film as the first chapter in the trilogy that is yet to be finished.  We are introduced to a bunch of characters, but we only get to know two or three of them, with the others just being background and essential for certain scenes to take place.

On the up side, the visuals in the film are absolutely amazing.  This is some of the coolest imagery that I have seen in a movie in a long time, but visuals aren't everything, and this film proves that.  The story is very interesting too, and the film does a fairly good job of developing the historical context of what is going on, but there is a lot that is mentioned that we get no information on whatsoever, and that sort of leaves the viewer out of the loop.  Maybe you need to read the book to get the true essence of the film, and I probably will, but as a stand alone movie, this film just basically does not work on a lot of levels.  As the first chapter in a trilogy, I can see how it will fit in with the other two films, but I don't even know if those are going to be released in the U.S., so it is tough to judge this film based on the trilogy, and not on the film itself.  I also think the film would have been a lot better if it would have simply included more action.  There is a surprising lack of action in the film.  There are really only 3 action scenes in a 2-hour film, and none of them are that long or impressive.  Again, this film is only set up, as most first volumes of a trilogy are, but still, I was expecting a little more along the lines of entertainment than I got.

Overall, Nightwatch is one of those films that I wouldn't say I liked or disliked, it just sort of.....is what it is.  When the film is released on DVD, I will definitely give it another chance, and I am sure that I will see the other parts of the trilogy if they ever do get released in the U.S.  There really isn't anything groundbreaking here, though.",1141603200,,3896,4.179384203480589
1593925,5,B00005JOYL,"This movie will take you by surprise with its special effects tour-de-force and story line.  The movie plot is established in the first scene, and the rest of the movie follows it implicitly.  The storyline is very good and intelligent.  This movie is a completely Russian styled movie so it is at times hard to follow, but you will never get totally lost following the story.  The subtitles are good but not perfect.  It has an epic sweep from the dark ages in France to present day Moscow, and makes an excellent job at transitioning from one phase of the story to another.  There is a second part of this movie that hasn't been released in Russia to date (late October 2004), and as with the ending of the Lord of the Rings part one, you will want to watch the second part as soon as this movie finishes and the credits start rolling.  I like Russian cinema and even though it can be difficult to follow from an American's point of view, this movie will make you want to see it over and over again and again, as well as immediately get the second part when it becomes available.",1098576000,2,1081,4.375

1593994,5,B00005JOYL,"The first time I saw this movie, I borrowed it from my local library and I regret that at first I neither got the point of the movie nor did I see that it was any big deal.  The trouble I had with this movie at first was that I had absolutely no concept as to what to expect from it.  I had never seen a preview and I never read about this movie, so I didn't have anything to go on and as such it all seemed strange to me at the time.  Well after a couple more views of this movie things really began to sink in tremendously.  The thing is this movie is not primarily an action movie.  It is mainly a fantasy film taking place in modern 21st century Moscow, Russia.  There is also some drama and comedy thrown in for good measure as well.

We start the movie off in the Middle Ages featuring two warring tribes of supernatural beings comprising of shafeshifters, vampires, wiches, magicians, etc. known as Others.  The Light Others are the good guys of whom look to see balance in the world and the Dark Others are the villains of whom desire nothing more than chaos.  Out of fear that the two groups of Others would completely annihilate eachother, Guesser, the leader of the Light Others and Zavulon the leader of the Dark Others, along with the main Inquisitor, decide to forge a truce via a peace treaty.  From then on the Light Others formed the Night Watch and The Dark Others formed the Day Watch to keep an eye on eachother so that the peace treaty isn't breached. Several years pass, the year is 1992 and we get introduced to our main character, Anton Gorodetsky.  Anton goes to a psychic named Ms. Schultz to have her use her powers to punish his wife, Irina Petrova, for running off with another guy.  His chosen punishment is having Ms. Schultz specifically use her powers to kill the unborn baby that Anton believes to be from her new guy.  Before this evil spell is completed the Night Watch soon intervene and totally put a stop to it.  They arrest and interrogate Ms. Schultz while allowing Anton to know that he is an Other.  12 years pass and Anton is now an operative with the Night Watch and of course, a Light Other.  Anton now has a two big tasks ahead of him as he must not only save the life of a young boy of whom Dark Other vampires are after but also to end a curse that a beautiful young female doctor has on her that could put an end to the world.

The concept of light vs dark may not be a new idea in particular with Star Wars and many other movies having come up with it first, but this movie does a remarkable job of just simply using that idea yet doing it in a considerably different and unpredictable manner.  This movie seems to take some great influence from Star Wars in many way for sure.  That alone is awesome.  Otherwise, you get a very fresh, original, and unique kind of movie concept.  Just the concept of there being powerful, supernatural beings to look and can act just like us and yet secretly have powers and an agency that is a total secret, is such a cool concept.  A little Men In Black like but not a whole lot.  You might think of them as the CIA of the supernatural world.

You meet some very interesting characters such as such as Guesser, Zavulon, Olga, Alice, Bear, Tiger Cub, Yegor, Svetlana, Semyon, and Kostya to name several.  Each one of them has their own personal power.  In some cases their namesake tells you what that power is.

The CGI is awesome and blends well with its surroundings.  I especially love the transformations from human to animal and from animal to human.  Very well done and edited.  The special effects for the Gloom where interesting as well.

Such characters such as Anton, Olga, Bear, and Tiger Cub prove to be charming, funny, and very likable characters that you can get behind.  The character development is just enough so that you can get a sense of the characters thoughts on things and about their quirks and whatnot.  Not every character is 3 dimensional but the right ones are.

The pacing to this movie is a little slow at first but it moves along at a comfortable pace once the chief plot elements come together with occasional slower parts to develop a character or plot point.  So it's all good there.

The villains are quite charismatic enough to make them memorable, iconic, and carry a slick, shrewd, and diabolical sensibility about them.

The chief women in the movie are all very attractive eye-candy.  Tiger Cub, Olga, the Vampiress, Svetlana, Irina, and Alice are all drop dead gorgeous and very hot.

My only complaint is not with the movie but rather just the way that for some reason the animated and interactive subtitles are nowhere to be seen.  Like many people those creative subtitles were one of the things that drew me to this awesome flick.  The lack of them is disappointing.  As for the transfer well I love what was done with the picture quality and the colors.  It's a crisper and much sharper picture and the colors are brighter.  The Blu-Ray and my HDtv both make everything on the screen seem to come to life in a highly visually stunning way adding further to the already awesome visuals and special effects.

Overall, if you are into: action, fantasy, unique, original, and creative ideas, magical human beings that represent the good side and other ones that represent the evil side, comedy, attractive people, interesting characters, and a suspense laden race against time to save the world then Night Watch is definitely for you.",1486771200,2,5464,4.474747474747475

I am giving it four stars because it did not completely waste my time and actually mildly kept my interest. i liked seeing Russian culture and the story was not bad. You'll probably find it a bit convoluted to follow but the characters were good. Its better than watching another American comic book re-hash. So give it a try.,1463184000,,406,4.486486486486487

My interest in this film came from the rave reviews it received from being compared to ""The Matrix"", which is one of my favorite films. While I see the resemblance in that comparison, the movie doesn't quite appeal or live up to that standard to me. This isn't a terrible film by any stretch of the imagination, but I think it's certainly over-hyped. This is just my personal opinion, as I'm not a particular fan of the supernatural genre.

I do not have any issues with foreign movies as long as they are subtitled and this one was fine.  However, the implementation of the storyline concept just did not work for me.  I was kind of interested to see what would happen, but after about 30-40 minutes I gave up on it and just stopped.  I can't quite put my finger on what exactly the problem was but it just felt a bit amateurish or cheesy and I did not want to waste any more of my time hoping that it would get better.

1594815,4,B00005JOYL,"This is great modern film from a country that we know very little about - honestly speaking.  Most Russians probably assume we all go around looking/talking like John Wayne or Clint Eastwoord; Melanie Griffith or Kim Kardashian.  We tend to think they all look like Kruschev, drink vodka constantly and don't own a car. This film and it's sequel give us a rare glimpse into modern life in Moscow, even as fictionalized as it is.

The story itself is compelling enough - the battle between forces of light and dark, under cease fire for a thousand years with permits issued for vampires and eye-for-eye justice when someone gets killed.  The backdrop is even more compelling.  The slums of Moscow juxtaposed with a luxury high rise appartment building.  Guess who lives where!

There to is the guiding plot of a failed marriage, an unwanted pregnancy, and the choice that everyone must make: am I a force of light or dark.

There is some violence and gore, but nothing gratuitous.  There are clever cuts between medieval battle scenes and modern ones. It's like Supernatural - Russian style.  One of my favorite bits is the rocket powered utility truck the forces of light drive around in.

1594947,5,B00005JOYL,"I had been hearing about this marvelous Russian film since 2008 and so finally at the incessant behest of my grandson (who's best friend is a Russian who just got his U.S. citizenship at twenty after living here since 13) I sat down with the two of them and watched it.  It's just great, much more imaginative than our current tentpoles spewing forth from a Hollywood bereft of originality.  I'm sure it's even better if you're Russian to begin with, because it does evoke their lifestyle intensely but it blew away this old jaded movie watcher from way way back!!  You can watch it in a decently dubbed English version or in the original version with some excellent English subtitling (as well thought out as the movie itself - you'll see) or in several other permutations depending on your linguistic preferences.  I don't do plots but suffice it to say this one is a combo of thriller, comedy, and superb action sequences that astound.  The sfx are as good as anything Cameron or Industrial Light And Magic can conjure and the hero is anti-hero enough to attract both the youth of today and the old geezers like me.  Non stop under the direction of a genius (well...either he or his cinematographer...or both!) action, twists and turns in the plot, and characters that really get under your skin.  I haven't had two hours of entertainment like that since I sat my tushy in that seat way back on May 25, 1977 and watched the first showing of Star Wars!!!  I kid you not!

1595124,4,B00005JOYL,"This is an original and strange but quite interesting Russian supernatural thriller. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Once upon the time, in fact in medieval times, lived The Others, allied with the forces of either Light or Dark. The two factions got into it, hard, until Geser, the lord of Light, realized that the two forces are evenly matched and asked for a truce. Zavulon, the boss of the Darkness, agreed. From now on there would be no fighting and every Other would have free choice between Light and Darkness. Warriors of Light would form a Night Watch and Warriors of Darkness would become the Day Watch, in order to enforce the agreement. The truce endured ever since then - until now...

This is just the introduction and I will say no more here about what happens in the film, except that the main ""hero"" is a man called Anton Gorodetsky, played by the excellent Russian actor Konstantin Khabensky (he also played amongst others the main character in ""Admiral""). With time Gorodetsky will become the object of great interest of both Night and Day Watch and he will discover a lot of troubling things about himself...

This film will mostly appeal to all amateurs of fantastic, fantasy and horror films, as it is a good mixture of all three of them, giving as final result a kind of (very) dark fantasy. Its strongest point is its originality, as it is completely not Hollywoodian (for obvious reasons) and the action is situated in today's Russia, a premise in itself quite fascinating. It is also a strange and surprising film, taking us to a surrealistic ride of which we can not anticipate the final ending... But for the same reason it is also a little bit confusing by moments and I think that cutting like 5-8 minutes would do it some good, as some scenes are unnecessary and too long.

Still, this is good, solid stuff, allowing fantasy afficionados to taste something else than the usual American fodder (which even if frequently good can get monotonous). I will have now to buy the sequel, called obviously ""The Day Watch"", to see how this whole story ends... Enjoy!",1385078400,,2115,4.723577235772358

That is, the film began in English as the director told the backstory of the being of dark and light watch - and then went directly into Russian when the bulk of the film began to unfold.  Personally, I find Russian to not be pleasing to the ear and even though the film had subtitles, they were put up and removed quickly so it became a difficult task following both the words and the action simultaneously.

The acting was TERRIBLE, the story line was broken and unfinished, characters were never introduced or developed, and quite honestly it was just a plain annoying movie.  Heck, in one part one of the characters is ripped up and on deaths door and then magically they have him waking up fine in bed.  And the ""drunk"" helpless act just doesn't work when the person is endowed with such super powers.  And WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THAT RIDICULOUS DRIVING VAN ALL THE TIME WITH THE TWO BUMBLING IDIOTS IN IT??  No I'm sorry, I just didn't get this movie.

The movies, both Night Watch and Day Watch cover for the most part, the same time period. The major weakness is the premise that a truce has held for give or take 1000 years prior to the time period of the books/movies. If the truce is broken and the perpetrator is not caught and punished then all Heaven and Hell breaks out and an apocalyptic war is started leading to the destruction of the world. People are born with a special attribute and must select the Light or the Dark side. The first 2 movies give different views of the same time period much as weaving with a loom in which there is a waft and weft that together complete the design. If one side has a Great Other that is not opposed by an equal strength other on the opposing side, then the side with the unopposed ""other"" will win. Day is equated with Light and Night with Dark.

1595475,5,B00005JOYL,"The novels written by Sergei Lukyanenko created a world filled with a ""believable"" urban fantasy horror mood and background very far from Vamp Romance or teenage horror. The author inspired himself in several sources, including possibly white wolf's world of Darkness (he even incorporated the ""umbra"") and created something unique. It was a true challenge to the director Timur Bekmambetov because not only he didn't had experience in those kind of films, his country also never had done nothing like it, neither the professional technicians nor the actors had worked in a fantasy movie before! This film is pioneering work done with inspiration and geniality. The angles are fabulous, the pacing is marvelous, the photography is first rate - it's scary, disturbing and quite violent - yes, it has quite some disturbing scenes (viewer discretion is advised).

The fight between Light and Dark is not exactly between good and evil (although very close), but also between responsibility and free will. The characters are extremely well portrayed and we can empathize with both Geser and Zavulon, the faction leaders (they are both extremely charismatic). Anton (the main character), brilliantly depicted by Konstantin Khabensky, is a nightwatch seer that gets involved in a nightmarish complex plot where the fate of the balance of powers is at stake.

As extras you will get several featurettes about the characters, subtitles and the series; there is also the trailer (although Russia has great cinema, I believe they must work a lot on this great marketing tool - the trailer), posters, making of, etc. Three stars for the extras.

Action moves between realities, with plenty of dark and dangerous magic even in our world. Effects really are special, from almost subliminal to dramatic set-pieces - that car/hotel passage, for example, comes off beautifully, but that's hardly the only sequence worth seeing.

This version has the subtitle option but anytime the narrator speaks, the voice is in English. I'm sure this won't bother most people but it is unbelievably irritating to me. Would have been nice if the distributors had included this linguistic hiccup in the packaging information. Still - an awesome, ridiculous movie.

1595499,3,B00005JOYL,"I will not lie, the movie was actually pretty good.  It takes the basic premise of the book and tosses a LOT out the window.  But, what they keep (not a lot) they do a good job with.  The effects with the subtitles was just awesome.  The flames spitting out the back of the truck, not so much.  I would have liked it much more if I had not read the book, I know the book was far too ""meaty"" for just a movie, but some of the stuff was just strange.  With my complaints (being a book elitist) it was still very enjoyable.

*FAIR WARNING* minor spoilers - Maxim was just tossed into the movie because he was in the book, no dagger.  Tiger Cub and Garik (now called Bear)are an item (WTF?!?!?!).  What is up with the Twilight now being called the Gloom?

Lastly, in the realm of minor spoilers, why does it start out exactly like Day Watch(book)except with Anton in the woman's place?

It's all in all a decent movie that is setting up for sequels that seem to be very loosely based around the books.

1595500,3,B00005JOYL,"Night Watch is the type of movie you'll watch and then want more and when you get more (in the form of Day Watch), you'll regret wanting it. And that's the problem -- Night Watch has some great ideas that are executed, for the most part, flawlessly. The movie isn't as action-packed as some would suggest, but there's enough fuel to keep the plot moving. On the other hand, the story has too much and plays like a multi-faceted novel instead of a movie. The ending is open-ended, but the main story continues in Day Watch, which is unfortunate because while Day Watch maintains the momentum of its predecessor, it falls apart at its cop-out ending.

So can Night Watch be recommended even though it's the first of two and the second sucks? No. I can't recommend it. On its own, it'll leave you wanting a sequel, which a good movie should do, but it still should be self-contained, which Night Watch isn't.

1595503,5,B00005JOYL,"Night Watch is a surprisingly good Russian supernatural thriller that is only just short of a modern cinematic masterpiece. No plot spoilers from me; the movie follows Anton, an agent of the ""Night Watch"", who keeps an eye on Dark Forces and protects a 1000 year old truce. There is a ""vortex"" forming in Moscow that heralds the restarting of the war between Light and Dark and Anton is assigned to find the cause. Along the way, we see that there is another reality that sort of runs concurrently with ours and it is filled with people who have special abilities (vampires, witches, fortune tellers, etc)  and who have chosen a side, either Light or Dark. The plot is solid and there are a few really good twists that makes this so much better than the standard horror flick.

The acting is very good, but the dialog is in Russian with subtitles in English. I understand that the theatrical release had much better subtitles that were actually like a part of the movie, but the ones on this version were perfectly serviceable. Where this movie really excels is in the creative use of special effects, which are often subtle and not over done, and in the often inspired cinematography.

1595550,5,B00005JOYL,"Based on the first of a trilogy of novels by Russian author, Sergei Lukyanenko, 'Nightwatch' plunges the viewer into a latter-day mystical cold war being played out on the streets of post-communist Moscow between the forces of darkness and light. Anton Gorodetsky is a reluctant, semi-alcoholic agent of  ""The Nightwatch"" - a self-regulating body pledged to keeping the forces of darkness, ""The Daywatch"", in check and prosecuting those of the day-watch who threaten the truce which has kept an uneasy peace between theses diametrically opposed forces for thousands of years.

However cataclysmic forces are gathering on the streets of Moscow - forces which have haunted Anton's past, threaten to destroy the present peace, and ignite a firestorm that could well destroy all our futures.

'Nightwatch' is an urban fantasy for for people who don't like or who have grown bored of urban fantasy as a genre.

Although it contains vampires, witches, curses and other ephemera of the genre, it treats them in a refreshingly grungy and highly intelligent manner. Whilst the pacing, cinematography, special effects and editing are geared towards the hyper-kinetic, director Timur Bekmambetov never allows the film's style to overwhelm the essential ordinariness or humanity of it's characters - a factor which is of critical importance in the film's denouement.

Highly recommended. Rent or buy it now. This is one roller-coaster ride that you'll be glad you took and a perfect antidote to the loathsome drek perpetuated by cinematic travesties such as the 'Underworld' films.",1236470400,2,2074,6.2160278745644595

I mean, I really couldn't believe my eyes.  A smart, funny, well acted, brilliant even, horror movie from Russia (in all honesty, how often does one see such a thing coming out of this country).  Not only that, I didn't have anything to really compare it to, it's that original.  It reminded me of the first time I saw The Evil Dead, it was that same kind of ""you've got to be kidding me"" kind of moment.  Even my partner was floored and she doesn't even like horror movies.  So if you're interested in an original, funny, unique, and complex movie, one that will change the way you think about horror movies and one that set Russian box office records, this is the ticket.",1219968000,2,825,4.318181818181818
1595596,5,B00005JOYL,"Based off a successful series of books (which I have, unfortunately, yet to read), Night Watch is part of a planned triology of movies detailing the struggles of The Others - supernatural creatures like vampires, werewolves, witches and stranger creatures that lurk, hidden amongst the mortal populace. Long ago, the armies of the Dark Others (who would exalt in their powers and enslave humanity) and the Light Others (who sought to protect humanity) fought each other to a standstill. On that day, they agreed to an ancient pact whereby the two forces would police each other. Set in modern day Moscow, this movie (and the sequel Day Watch) successful capture the feel of urban Russia.

The story revolves around Anton, an alcoholic Light Other who serves on the 'Night Watch' (policing the Dark Others). While on the trail of a pair of vampires, Anton runs across a woman who is surrounded by a dark vortex, which may affect the entire world! Behind the scenes, the action is overshadowed by the figures of Gesser (leader of the Light Others) and  Zavulon (ruler of the Dark Others). The story is quite richly detailed and elaborate (hey, it IS Russian after all) and the action goes by very quickly, but you will get sucked into the plot. Despite the supernatural elements, and the brilliant special effects, these are actually fairly understated. Nonetheless, this is one of the most brilliant applications of the supernatural that I've ever seen in a film.

For those who want to see a new direction in Sci-Fi, Horror and Fantasy, I strongly recommend checking this film out, along with it's sequel 'Day Watch' and the forthcoming 'Twilight Watch.' Especially if you are a fan of Russian/Eastern European film-making. I only wish more American film-makers would take a cue from Moscow and make movies this good! It is phenomenal, even breath-taking! Loved it!",1215388800,3,1865,4.952076677316294
1595597,3,B00005JOYL,"The eternal war of the Dark against the Light is fought by
the ""others"". One of the others is tricked into betraying his only child to the Dark.
A very bloody movie with very strange special effects,
more like a western sword and sorcery than science fiction.
For an atheistic 'Communist' culture such a movie must of been forbidden.
The times are really changing and they really don't have any priests
to appeal to to drive out evil spirits.
Here a victory for the Dark side is recorded:

I saw clips of this movie while watching another movie. I was so excited to watch it because the previews looked good. Damn, I was wrong big time!!!! this movie sucked badly. The dailog was hard to understand and the story line was all over the place. You didn't know who was suppose to be bad and who was suppose to be good. My advice and if I were you, I would listen.

1595600,1,B00005JOYL,"Don't watch it if you've read the book. This is a total disappointment. It was only about 40% true to the original book. It has a totally different feel from the book itself. So if you were fascinated by the book, don't watch the movie, the personalities of the characters are different from the book (Gesar a fat middle-aged man wearing cheap suits, Zabulon a punk playing video games, Anton a hysterical coward, you get the idea), the story line is also different from the book, the whole exotic feel , mystic feeling is gone. Either the director was not good or the actors were not good enough, the acting of almost all the characters feels very forced and unrealistic. Cannot be compared to either the LOTR series or even the Harry Potter series, just can't, not the same level at all.",1205798400,5,789,4.563380281690141

It's absolutely different, the story line is changed, and all the great scenes the book had are not in the movie...........very disappointing.
At least you get to understand whats happening........but if it weren't for the book I guess most people seeing the movie alone will be VERY confused.........
I do not recommend it to people who loved the book, I at least will continue to read these novels only.",1204588800,2,503,4.662921348314606
1595602,4,B00005JOYL,"I wasn't really sure what I expected from a Russian movie, but this was way more than I thought it would be.  The cinematography and special effects looked like a big-budget Hollywood production, with a great plot and rockin sound track.  Yes, it is sub-titled, but I have never seen sub-titles done like this, if anything they add to the movie rather than subtract from it, interacting with what's happening on screen. This is the kind of things they do, stuff in the foreground will cover them, or they'll blow away like smoke, or sometimes they're red and will dissolve like blood in water.  I guess my best recomendation is that I'm already downloading Day Watch cause I can't wait to see what happens next.",1203984000,,711,4.672

1595604,1,B00005JOYL,"Ok, I am Russian and I watched this in Russian, not dubbed, and I swear this was the most confusing film I've ever seen. I was actually intrigued by it after seeing so many good reviews. But no matter how hard I tried to pay attention and to figure out what the heck was going on, I was completly lost. Maybe on another viewing I could have 'got it'. However, I wasn't even interested in what I saw the first time around and I could never picture myself actually watching that again. My husband agreed too. I don't normally give up so easily on a film I didn't understand, but all I saw was a visually cool, but messed up film.",1202688000,4,627,4.190082644628099
1595635,2,B00005JOYL,"I bought Nightwatch after reading many positive reviews on the internet, some even on Amazon. The film was an extreme disappointment. The movie revolves around people known as others who possess supernatural powers. The movie features a few vampires, some type of abortion-witch, and a lady who turns into a tiger. There is a guy who supposedly can turn into a bear but it is never shown in the movie. The main character seems entirely devoid of powers except perhaps his ability to get stabbed multiple times and bring down a whole movie. For the most part the movie was action-less. There were no fight scenes or scenes of suspense. The dubbing was terrible as the voice actors used russian accents that made understanding what they said difficult. The only redeeming part of the movie was a scene where the main character screams on the subway while everyone stares at him like he's a weirdo. This movie wasted 114 minutes of my life. If it weren't for me and my friends making fun of it, the movie would have been intolerable.",1202256000,4,1030,4.696132596685083
1595636,4,B00005JOYL,"When the Russians start trying to get into the world of fantasy, they have to go back to the oldest Slavonic, we could even say Lithuanian as the old Teutonic Knights would have said, legends possible and bring them to life in the present so well and so intensely that we don't know where real reality is and where fiction lies (two meanings intended). Of course blood and all kinds of gross and other physical tortures and distortions and sufferings accumulate minute after minute, never ending, never coming to the slightest beginning of an end. They capture, because they have never lost it, the curse of a medieval vision in which evil is all powerful but cannot exist without good living next to it and fighting against it. Note good is submitted to the same curse. It is their vision of the world. Evil is necessary for the world to be able to survive its own menacing death, for anything not too bad to come out of the deeply bad witch's brew in a witch's pot history is. This vision is absolutely diabolically human. The devil is in man and man could not even exist if the devil was not in him. Some of the visual special effects are extremely good. Some others are more average. But I find it very funny to consider that your own backbone is your sword and that you can draw it to fight against - or is it for? - the existential survival of evil.

1595637,3,B00005JOYL,"""Night Watch"" is one of those ""unseen war"" movies.  You know the kind: their plots spring from the premise that there's been an ages-long supernatural or futuristic-type war going on right under the noses of humanity, only we're not aloud, or are just too dumb, to see it.  Other examples of this growing sub-genre include ""Hellboy"", ""Constantine"", the ""Matrix"" trilogy, and the two ""Underworld"" films.

This one's about ""good"" supernatural beings (who mostly seem to be shapeshifters and telepaths) versus ""bad"" supernatural beings (who mostly seem to be vampires).  There's an uneasy truce between both sides, rules of behavior that tend to get broken, and rumors of a ""chosen one"" who must pick a side in the ""coming war"" and ultimately tip the balance to one side or the other.  Yes, you've seen this sort of thing before.

Moments of plot deja vu aside, I found this Russian-made movie generally imaginative and entertaining enough, but definitely not as amazingly good as all the hype a few years ago suggested it would be.  I did like it enough to want to eventually check out ""Day Watch"", the next installment, though I can't say I'm exactly going to rush out and get it.

I can't resist this final quibble, however: wanting a fast pace for your movie is fine, but do you HAVE to generate that fast pace by employing that slick, hyper-fast MTV-style editing technique, laced with show-offy slo-mo and speeded-up visual flourishes?  Do people actually like this type of editing?  I guess some do.  Myself, I find it distracting, and certainly overused.

The English dubbing job is very good, though.  When I perused the DVD viewing options, I chose to watch it that way instead of in the original Russian (also offered), as I didn't want to subject my wife to watching a geeky horror movie AND having to read sub-titles.  Unlike the editing, the dubbing was polished, subtly-done, and decidedly NOT distracting.",1201564800,,1918,4.897832817337461
1595638,5,B00005JOYL,"This movie was an amazing story!  To think that THIS movie was this good and only made on a budget of 10 Million US$ astounds me.  I HIGHLY recommend this, however be warned, there is much gratuituous violence.",1200268800,,210,4.5
1595639,4,B00005JOYL,"It's simple:

The movie is amazing.

That being said, they somehow topped themselves with Day Watch, and it doesn't seem to even need the backstory that Night Watch provides. Nevertheless, steeped in Russion mythology, it is a fantastic movie. Have at it!",1199750400,,255,5.0476190476190474
1595640,3,B00005JOYL,"Foreign films are not easy to review. The biggest problem is usually in the translation.

Have you ever tired to watch a poorly dubbed or translated Chinese martial arts film? They tend to be hilarious due to the translation from Chinese to English. Usually this happens when it's translated in Hong Kong or China.

Another problem with reviewing a foreign film is that quite often cultural references and other minor nuances are lost on the viewer.

Consider this. Over the years I've watched quite a few Filipino and Hindi Movies. For me, most of the Filipino movies I've watched were pretty straightforward and easy to understand, although quite often there were obvious differences between our culture and theirs.

Hindi movies on the other hand - well, most of the time when I watched one I was left sitting there scratching my head in confusion. Humour, unless it was slapstick or obvious, was completely lost on me.

The other night I watched a movie called Nightwatch. It's based on the first book of a modern day Russian fantasy / horror trilogy that was a major hit over in the former Soviet Union country.

It was so successful in fact that they made movies of the first two books in the trilogy.

Now, being a fan of this type of genre (not a huge fan, but a fan none the less), I decided to give the two movies that have been made a shot. I bought both of them and they've been sitting on my shelf for several weeks, waiting for the opportune moment for me to sit down and give them a view.

After I finished watching the movie, I was left scratching my head. I was able to follow, for the most part, what was going on in it, but I'm pretty sure that I missed a great deal due to the cultural differences between Canada and Russia.

The story, from what I could gather, is that for centuries the balance between good and evil has been carefully maintained. There are essentially two organizations, the Nightwatch (good) and the Daywatch (evil). They are, in effect, the police force for good and evil, and they monitor one another constantly.

The world is filled with what they call `others'. These others (not the Lost type, mind you), are Vampires, magic wielders, shape shifters, and other creatures of mythology.

Legend has it that there will be an other born who will tip the scales for either good or evil, but this other will have to choose which side he or she will join. It's supposed to lead to Armageddon.

The movie begins with a young man going to a witch to get back the woman he loves, and to kill the unborn child she's carrying in her womb. The ceremony is interrupted by the Nightwatch, and much to everyone's surprise, he can see them.

Fast forward twelve years and he's now part of the Nightwatch.

Now, this is where the movie gets confusing. Is he a vampire? I honestly don't know. But he's sent out to track down a child who is one of the others in order to prevent him from falling into the hands of vampires.

Things go south real fast, and he kills one of the Vampires. From the way I understand it, there is no killing between the two factions. If there is, it's treated like a crime and those responsible are punished.

Anyhow, it just keeps getting stranger and stranger, and the plot revolves for some reason around this child, and a cursed woman who has to have the curse removed or the world will be destroyed.

Honestly, I couldn't figure out what was going on, and I was still pretty confused when the movie ended, but I'm pretty sure that they were able to resolve things and they prevented the destruction of the world.

At least for the time being.

Now, the acting was, I guess, ok. Hey, they were all Russian actors and thus completely unknown to me. The movie itself was set in Moscow, and man, I thought we had some ugly cities, but the movie was shot mainly in run-down neighbourhoods, so I'll have to assume that it was done on purpose.

The special effects were pretty good, nothing absolutely spectacular. Plenty of use of computer graphics anyhow. Although the whole bit with the crows and the vortex over the apartment complex was pretty neat.

I have to say that I didn't really care for the movie now that I've had some time to digest it and think about it. The main reason is that it was so difficult to understand.

Normally I pick up on fantasy and science fiction easily, but in this case, it was over my head.

And, as the beginning of my review stated, I'm pretty sure it had to do with the cultural barrier that I faced sitting down to watch it.

Will I watch the sequel, Daywatch? Yeah, I am going to. I know it's a longer movie, but the fact is that I paid for it, and I don't like to throw money away.

Finally, the lack of bonus material was disconcerting. There was an extended roof top scene (near the end of the movie) and that was it.

This is how I imagine Moscow would look. Worn out, dirty. Huge isolated housing units, flimsy building materials. The plot was interesting, the actors good. Special effects weren't blockbuster, but they weren't cheesy either. It is what it is, a decent little fantasy movie. If you like this sort of movie then I highly recommend. If however you can't live without Hollywood super pyrotechnics, forget it. Get Ghostrider instead.",1198972800,2,578,4.908163265306122
1595642,5,B00005JOYL,"Based upon a novel by Sergei Lukyanenko, NIGHTWATCH is an action-packed, cinematically illuminating film from Russia about the individual decisions that people make and how those choices and affect the struggle between good and evil.  The movie begins with a prologue explaining that there people who live in the world who resemble humans, but are not.  These people are known as Others.  The exist in our world, but also live in a plane separate from it. Others have an incredibly long lifespan and have powers.  Wizards and witches, sorcerers and shapeshifters, and other such creatures are all Others.

As the prologue explains, the Others belong to one of two sides: Light and Dark.  Light Others seek to help humanity and coexist in peace while Dark Others seek to torment and plague humanity and use humans as a means for gaining power.  Over a millennia before, the Light and Dark faced each other in a deadly battle.  Both sides were evenly matched and to save the lives of those that weren't killed, a truce was formed.  Dark Others who make sure the Light follows the truce are known as the Day Watch, while Light others who make sure the Dark keeps the truce are known as Night Watch.

NIGHT WATCH follows the story of a particular member of the Night Watch.  In 1992, Anton Gorodetsky discovers that his wife has been having an affair and wants to divorce him.  He seeks out the aid of a witch to get back at the man who has wrecked his life.  He is informed by the woman that his wife is pregnant and that she can get rid of the child, but only if Gorodetsky is willing to take the responsibility of the action upon himself.  Gorodetsky seems to assume that the child isn't his and agrees.  However, before the deed can be finished, the Night Watch arrives to arrest the witch and saves the child.  Gorodetsky is amazed at the people he sees and learns then that he is an Other.

The movie fast forwards twelve years later. Gorodetsky is now a valuable member of the Night Watch and is on the prowl seeking to save a young boy from being eaten by a couple of vampires.  The boys' name is Yegor and after a violent battle Gorodetsky learns that Yegor is actually his son.  While trying to protect his son from revenge, Gorodetsky also become entangled with a woman name Svetlana (Mariya Poroshina) who has been cursed and is a part of the key that will bring about Armageddon.  The film builds until a climatic battle upon the rooftop of a Moscow apartment building where the fate of the world is decided by the choices of Gorodetsky.

What makes NIGHT WATCH so interesting to watch isn't the plot.  There are countless movies about ""others"" living among us and the strains they go through to co-exist and the constant struggle between good and evil.  What DOES make NIGHT WATCH an interesting and fascinating movie is the cinematography.  The film has some breathtaking and amazing images.  Some of these shots were done using traditional old school film techniques, but many of them were done using computer effects.  The result is a film that doesn't look anything like a traditional Hollywood big budget fantasy/action picture and stands on its own as an example of the power of the medium.  Some of the shots appear so simple, but when viewed again one can is overwhelmed by the complexity.

NIGHT WATCH was a huge film in Russia and during the year of its release became the largest grossing Russian film ever (until that record was broken by a different movie a year later).  Ironically, the film doesn't look anything like a typical big budget Hollywood film, but was protested by the group ""Padonki"" for being too American and Hollywood.

Highly recommended for any person who considers themselves a student of film or for people that like Russian and/or fantasy films.",1198627200,,3790,4.672699849170438

The special effects are just mind-boggling. The story really takes wild twists and turns - you have no clue what to except next (compare that to cookie-cutter hollywood plots). I guess some people might say that story is hard to follow because - i liked - but even if - the end of the movie makes it all worth it. Character acting makes the scenes feel creepingly real - as they are very melodramatic moments from real life. Even if you are not usually into vampires & witches - still watch this movie - as the movie will quickly succumb with you in variety of different cinematographic elements (too bad its not availalble on blu-ray).

1595694,4,B00005JOYL,"3.5 out of 5 stars for NIGHT WATCH.

In the eternal struggle between darkness and light, a balance must be maintained. Long ago, a pact was made which granted to every person the free will to choose which side to join. To ensure this liberty, the forces of darkness assembled the Daywatch. And, for the light, the equivalent is the Nightwatch.

12 years ago, a man named Anton made a malevolent deal with a witch. To regain his straying wife, he accepted the sin of the dark magic intended to consume his wife's unborn child, a child not his own. But agents of the Nightwatch arrived just in time and the foul act was aborted. Moments later, Anton's nascent precognitive abilities surfaced, his Otherness confirmed. The Nightwatch quickly brought him into the fold.

Cut to the present. Anton, now a full-fledged Nightwatch member (never mind that his skills in field work are dubious), receives instructions to track down a boy mesmerized by a vampire. En route, he glimpses a girl on the subway and undergoes a shocking bout of clairvoyance. The Vortex of Damnation, the source of all Darkness, hovers above this cursed girl. A prophecy is recalled, proclaiming the arrival of a powerful entity who must decide between good and evil, of which choice will once and for all tip the balance towards one side. The final battle draws near.

NIGHT WATCH is the aggresively-shot cinematic adaptation of Russian author Sergei Lukyanenko's popular contemporary dark fantasy novel, and it's fairly good and made a lot of rubles in its native box office. Despite its flaws, I quite enjoyed the movie experience and particularly appreciated the film's frenetic energy. NIGHT WATCH unveils a world become a feverish and apocalyptic nightmare - inhabited by vampires, magicians, bestial shapeshifters, and others of that supernatural ilk - and so what if the production values don't quite live up to the immense scale of the story? The actors are enthusiastic and the dark fantasy/horror elements are for the most part intriguingly envisioned (Anton's tension-wracked clash with the vampire lovers near the beginning is a must-see). A nice quirk is Anton's assigned partner Olga, who had just completed serving out 60 years of punishment trapped in the shape of an inanimate owl figure.

The movie does suffer from an occasional lack of clarity, the storyline feeling somewhat scattershot. I kept my eye on the screen for every second, but I have a feeling I missed out on some of the nuances (I actually might have to read the book now). My confusion wasn't abated by the actors' lines which now and then proved to be incomprehensible, but my crappy ear for accents is probably at fault here. The camera work is gratifyingly, sometimes jarringly, hectic and is key to lending a deliciously gothic atmosphere, but it sometimes lapses into the amateurish; it's no biggie, though, and I liked the effort.

Fans of fantasist Sergei Lukyanenko know that there are several sequels to Night Watch. So it's no real surprise that this flick ends without a definitive resolution. In fact, the ending ratchets up the intensity and heightens even further that already prevailing sense of foreboding. I've already ordered the film sequel DAY WATCH, and I can't wait to watch it. But I should get a flashlight.",1191110400,,3285,4.952813067150635

Since pre-history, Others have existed on Earth in their own secret world, Light ones energized by Light and protecting Good - and unsuspecting humans - and Dark ones feeding on Darkness and promoting Evil. All have some super power: telepathic visions, telekinesis, shape-shifting. Some are vampires. All have the right to choose between Darkness and Light. In ancient times, the two sides engaged in violent conflict for World domination.  Now they live in a truce so tense and fragile that ""Watches"" have been set up to protect it: agents of Light guard on the Night Watch against harm (such as a vampire bite that will turn a human into a Dark Other) to humans, while agents of Dark take over on the Day Watch to protect their own selfish interests from Light Others. But soon in Moscow, the truce may be broken forever when a boy named Yegor, who will develop powers never seen before, makes his choice (this is serious stuff...).

Meanwhile, Anton - played by Russian mega-star Konstantin Khabensky - has been dumped by his wife. He puts the World on a path to destruction when he asks a witch/Dark Other to help him get her back. Turns out that the unsuspecting Anton is an Other too, a seer who chooses the Light. Twelve years later, he's a Night Watch agent, using his visions to hunt vampires. He has to drink blood in order to do his job, and spends his off hours wallowing in guilt and vodka over his past and wondering if he chose the Light against his destiny. He's smart and brave, but bumbles around in an alcoholic's fog and doesn't always do his job well. Khabensky makes him endearingly goofy and very sexy.

This movie is an amazing overload for the senses, moving so fast through its complex plot and eye-popping - yet very believable - special effects that it's hard to understand in one viewing. Watch it more than once to catch the best parts...the depth of the plot, the subtle humor, and the amazing shots of Moscow at night.",1190246400,,2014,4.6016713091922

1595728,1,B00005JOYL,"Night Watch is about the worst sci-fi action movie that I have ever watched.  The story makes no sense.  It is about the century old war between good and evil, although I have difficulty telling which side is good.  CG was way overdone.  The few action sequences are ridiculously derivative.  It makes Ultraviolet looks like a masterpiece.

Like others, I got sucked into this for 2 reasons.
1. Hey it is a foreign movie. It took studios a great deal of effort to import it, then it's gonna be good.  WRONG!  It is beyond my rational understanding why Americans choose to bring over these foreign trash.
2. The movie gets great press reviews and endorsements from Tarantino. It must be good.  WRONG!  (As a matter of fact, stay away from any Tarantino endorsed movies.  9 out of 10 times, they are garbages.)",1187654400,2,808,4.619718309859155
1595729,5,B00005JOYL,"There are creatures amongst us, some light and some dark, committed to a truce to end an otherwise catastrophic form of eternal conflict. Enter the Night Watch, the guardians that keep the Dark in check, and the Day Watch, that do the reverse. Both sides await the coming of a prophesized ""other"" who will choose his prospective side and shift this otherwise eternal variation of static warfare, however, and the time seems to be coming soon. Enter Anton, a seemingly innocuous man with a love he wants to preserve, who is told that his love is pregnant - that the child is not his - and that the only way his love can be preserved is through the death of an innocent. Reluctantly Anton agrees to this but, in the midst of the witchery, the Night Watch comes in and stops the procedure. In the middle of that, Anton finds out that he is what is referred to as one of The Others; that things are happening around him, that he can see things that were previously unseen and do things in conjunction with either the light or the dark, and that he is changed.
And the story begins building from there.

While the DVD version of the movie isn't very popular, this is actually a really unique take on the world of the supernatural. Vampirism is explained here, shapeshifters are seen, and some of the strangest clashes between Light/Dark cultures are explored by Anton and the characters around him. This makes for a great story that keeps on keeping on, dragging itself deeper and deeper into a world that seems so alien when setting side-by-side with our own. I liked that; there was a lot of time spent building a world inside the world but there wasn't a lot of time spent dumbing it down so a viewer could watch it. It simply is the way it is, it has the rules it has, and the ""why"" isn't always explained. This, combined with the fact that we see the coming of the other and w also witness how the ripples of one action melds into a forest of other actions, really makes a person watch.
As Anton himself says, ""curse"" isn't simply a word.

The other thing about the movie is the visuals, which are absolutely mindblowing. Some of the things that happen are simply amazing, either by conflict or by the traversing of something called ""the gloom,"" and then there is the bigger saga that simply looks good while the movie plays out. The whole of the movie looks good, too, from the beginning shots that explain the battle between the forces to series where Anton is simply ""looking"" at a boy while trying to follow him. Perhaps it was because the movie was Russian or perhaps it was because some people found the format of the tale unappealing - it was more of a chapter than a complete tale, but the chapter was self-contained and told a story all its own -  or the unheralded release of the movie made it unappealing. Whatever the reason, this movie should have gotten a lot more acknowledgement than it did because the storyline and the visuals combine to make something grand.

Again, this is a really interesting tale and would be good for anyone that wants something different from the obvious stories set to supernatural tones. The one thing to keep in mind is that the disc is double-sided and one side is dubbed and the other side is in Russian (with subtitles). I'm personally a fan of original language movies so I'm glad I noticed the Russian side of the movie, but I could see how this could confuse (and turn people off to the movie). The disc also comes with an extended ending with optional commentary and ""sneak peaks"" of the sequels.

The video quality of the DVD is pretty good, although most of the scenes are too dark for my personal taste. The story line is confusing. Character development, besides the main personage, is virtually non-existent. Actors play, with the possible exception of some of the supporting roles, is terrible.

1595785,2,B00005JOYL,"It is disappointing to see that Russian film makers are apparently as inept as their Hollywood counterparts when it comes to translating books to film. I realize that some changes are necessary due to the differences in medium but it seems odd that in this case one of the sacrifices are the great visuals described by Sergei Lukyanenko in his novels.  Instead of the Twilight as described by Lukyanenko we get flies and people fading in and out. Its not just the Twilight either. Instead of a black vortex over Svetlana's head, we get her hair blowing all around her and then, later, a bunch of crows flying circles over her building.

Unfortunately its not just the visuals that change either.  Lukyanenko's story ponders the difference between the Light and the Dark and how Good often does Evil in pursuit of what it sees as the greater good as Anton seeks to unravel the mystery of whats actually going on around him.  Those complexities are pretty much gone in order to turn the movie into a more streamlined actioner that requires little thought to follow.  For example, Zabulon's machiavellian manipulations are largely replaced with him repeatedly playing out the final confrontation with Anton in the form of a video game until things go the way he wants them.

In a reversal of the book, the more important Svetlana storyline is reduced to a minor subplot that is resolved in a singularly unsatisfying sequence and which seems to have little, if any, connection to the plot surrounding Egor.

The director makes some curious choices as well. Despite the movie's emphasis on action, the rooftop confrontation between Night and Day Watch is reduced to a brief fight between Anton and Zabulon.  I suppose this allows for more shots of the Nightwatchmen, clad in matching jumpsuits and dark sunglasses, tooling around town in what can only be termed the Nightwatch-mobile.  Also, because the story apparently isn't cliched enough, Egor is now Anton's son and he now chooses a side rather than balance between Light and Dark like he does in the novel.

My advice would be to read the novel and forget the movie.  You'll get a better story that way.",1181692800,4,2154,4.826086956521739

This is NOT Light vs. Dark.

This is a deconstruction of Light and Dark.

This is an opportunity to understand the personality, methodology and mannerisms of those who favor feeding off the hopes or fears of humanity.

The abashment of those caught in what might be considered ""the middle"" and the utter ignorance of those that are unawares.

To quote ""Olga"" (adlib): ""The difference between light others and dark others is the part of the human they feed on.""

I find this concept quite intriguing.

This movie's ""trance"" comes more from relying on the strength of plot and good acting over the visual overload that bad movies have to rely on so heavily.

Don't get me wrong though, I will not speak badly of the visual affects, they were tantalizing and provocative; Eye candy without the sugar-shock. I really enjoyed how ""The Gloom"" was realized.

There was no way they could have made this movie and stayed honest to the books' stories.  So instead they took ideas from the book and made it their own movie.  Rarely do I like when directors do this (Peter Jackson), but it truly does work here.

As for the movie, it is stunning to watch.  The only reason for the 4 star rating instead of 5 is that there is a clutter of information in the story that just gets confusing.  It isn't an intellectual thing, rather it's just a bit of poor story telling.  This is not the original cut of the movie though.  The russian version is longer, and this one was ""Americanized"".  I haven't seen the original (though I'm dying to), but it may resolve these issues.  With that said, the movie flows very well and is just unbelievably shot.  What great cinemetography and effects.

Over and over, I see people comparing this movie to The Matrix. Frankly, I just don't think that is a very good comparison. There are a few topical similarities, but plot-wise and subject-matter-wise, it just really didn't remind me of The Matrix at all.

This movie is about introducing you to some of the finer points of an underworld that involves supernatural creatures such as werewolves, vampires, shapeshifters, etc. And I mean that literally, it is about INTRODUCING you to this world. The storyline doesn't really cover a lot of ground beyond setting up the situations and characters for the upcoming conflict, the battle to end all battles.

Indeed, having now watched the trailer for the second movie, Day Watch, I find it rather amusing that the TRAILER for movie #2 has more explanation of the storyline in it than the entire first movie. The Day Watch trailer ALSO has more special effects in it than what Night Watch had, LOL.

And that is my other primary complaint about Night Watch. There is a great deal of reference to special powers, but most of them are not seen in the movie at all. What must have been limited special effects funds were all spent focused on the gory parts.

Since this trilogy is based upon a series of novels, I am going to assume that there is a great deal more of value in the first installment, and that value simply failed to permeate through the script writing. I am going to add these novels to my books-to-read list and see.

Granted, stunning visuals will never take the place of a stunning plot, but in lieu of one, it's nice to have the other.

The darkly lavish ""Night Watch"" is Russia's answer to the vampire movie, a twisted tale about the warring forces of Good and Evil and the hasty (and rather shaky) pact they made that allows them to operate within certain parameters without getting in each others' way.  These forces are known, collectively, as Others.

At the start of the film, our lead, Anton Gorodetsky, enlists the help of a witch in an attempt to get his ex-wife to return to him, but the witch is stopped in mid-ritual by the Night Watch -- the ""Good"" Others -- because she lied to Anton about the circumstances of the spell (thus violating the ancient pact).  Anton is thrust maddeningly into this dark, tarry underworld, and he also discovers that he, too, is an Other.

Anton chooses the side of Light and spends his life hunting down those Dark Others who are not abiding by the terms of the long-standing agreement between Good and Evil.  But the times, they are a-changing.  It seems a new Other has been born, one whose power will end the stalemate between Black and White and usher in a new era where the rules no longer apply.

The rules, as they are, are vague anyway.  Anton's world is built on some presuppostions that many viewers (I, at least) may not be aware of.  And the cogs and wheels of the war between the two worlds turn according to a logic that isn't what you would call instantly familiar.  However, they also turn at a rambunctious pace, throwing off enough sparks to distract anyone from the story's odd structure, weird methodology, and gaping holes.

Well-ventilated though the tale may be, the central mechanism of the plot is firmly in place, and is actually kind of heartbreaking.  Although there are elements that are superfluous (the character of Maxim Ivanovich), incongruous (the introductory scene), and vague (the video game fortune teller), the core storyline is satisfying enough.

I get the impression that all of the weird, orbiting, and unconnected bits of plot would've made for a stronger story had the movie been extended to, say, three hours long (or made into a mini-series), giving the gaps time to be filled in.  Even as it stands, with a slim (and slightly shattered) story, the film is still, if nothing else, an amazing technical achievement.  Ignore the unfinished philosophical musings, relish the kaleidoscopic editing, and sit back with some popcorn.

1595825,4,B00005JOYL,"This is a highly entertaining and original movie which deserves to reach a wide audience.  Although in the fantasy / horror genre, its style will endear it to others, in the same way `The Matrix' did.

However, this is no clean cut Matrix style movie - though similarly ambitious in story, this is down and dirty.  The world contains The Others, people who though mortal have gifts, whether sorceresses, witches, mediums, vampires or whatever.  At some point in their life they have to choose to be part of the army of Dark, or part of the army of Light.  Through a prologue which sets this up, oddly spoken in English and looking like it uses leftover armour from Lord of the Rings, we see the dark and the light have formed a truce.  This story follows the Night Watch - these are Others who are of the Light, but during the night they check their counterparts do not break the truce.  In particular, it follows one man who following a meeting with someone that looks suspiciously like a Russian version of The Oracle from The Matrix, makes choices which threaten to upset the whole balance and truce.

Music, acting, directing and art direction are all uniquely Russian and yet in quality are the match of any current Hollywood film.  There are quibbles - the parallels to Ghostbusters plot are distracting - the yellow emergency vehicle for getting fast to paranormal events, the vortex around the skyscraper which becomes the focus of the climax. On the other hand, the originality makes up for this - the occasional striking use of CGI, the lack of perfect ending that Hollywood would have provided, and most especially the subtitles!  The subtitles are a star in their own right and make the movie even more worth watching - if you get the two disc set make sure you watch the theatrical version, which has subtitles on screen.  They are in colour, they jump about the screen, they appear and disappear in unexpected ways..

Then I bought the book that it's based on. Luckily I saw the movie first and enjoyed it. The book (of course)is much better, and makes much more sense. The movie departs from the storyline of the novel by quite a bit, but I can live with it.

1595832,4,B00005JOYL,"It's about time the Russians gave us something besides ICBMs targeted on our cities and nuclear power plants in Iran.  It's actually a little difficult to review Night Watch (Nochnoy Dozor); it's a film you hate to criticize, even though the plot can get pretty confusing at times.  The special effects are darned impressive, certainly up to (if not better than) the standards of your typical Hollywood blockbuster, but I don't think the stylish atmosphere of the film rises to the point of richness.  Night Watch actually reminded me a bit of Constantine in that regard - but I must say that Night Watch is easily the better film of the two.

What you've got here is basically an eternal struggle between good and evil, with both sides really residing in a gray area in between.  Supposedly, there was this huge confrontation between the forces long ago - but, seeing that both equally matched sides would surely annihilate one another, both sides agreed to a truce that has held for many, many years.  Light rules the day, Night rules the night, and both sides watch one another to make sure no one goes around messing with that whole balance thing.  Who are these guys, anyway?  They call themselves the Others, and everyone among them has some kind of special power that is decidedly more than human (most humans can't transform themselves into cheetahs, for example).  As with all such mystical beings, there's a prophecy.  This one says that some Other will emerge and win the day for one side - it could be Light, or it could be Dark.  Sounds a little like Star Wars, doesn't it?

Anton Gorodetsky (Konstantin Khabensky) discovers that he is an Other after seeking the assistance of some ooby jooby lady to get his wife back.  That whole thing doesn't go too well, which isn't all bad because a wife would sort of get in the way of Anton's new job - tracking down vampires who are illegally ""calling"" victims to them.  Even though he chose the Light side, he still has to scarf down a bunch of blood in order to exercise his special gift.  Things start to heat up after he kinda sorta kills one of the agents of Darkness, but everything comes down to a contest between both sides to lay claim to a boy who may bring balance to the Force (oops, I mean tip the balance for one side over the other).  There's a twist toward the end, which probably won't come as a huge surprise to some viewers, but the conclusion succeeds very well in setting the stage for the next installment in what will be a trilogy of films.

While I can't get as breathlessly excited over the film as a good many others have (including the population of Russia, who made this the country's highest grossing film ever - although it only held that title for a few months), it's still an enjoyable, visually stunning, decidedly different type of film - and a real treat for Western audiences.  Don't worry about the subtitles, either, as they are superb.  If the writers can firm up the storyline as they work their way into the sequels, then the sky's the limit with this enigmatic Russian trilogy.",1163376000,11,3074,4.586837294332724
1595833,4,B00005JOYL,"I happen to be a great fan of Sergei Lukyanenko.  I have read most of his works and reread the Night Watch at least 5 times.  Needless to say, I was absolutely ecstatic when I heard about the movie. However, I must say I expected a little more.  Lukyanenko's novel is a story of an individual's search for identity.  It is in its essence a novel that explores human nature and inner struggles of the soul.  I did not feel that this theme came through in the film too well.  The changes to the plot line worked well to move the movie along, but took away for the story.

Anton Gorogetsy is no longer introduced to us as a character with a clean slate, but a man with so much emotional baggage that his development though the film seems incidental at times.  Moreover, his struggle to understand and accept his own reality is glazed over in a few clich comments.  As a result, the essence of the novel seems to get lost in the shuffle somewhat.

The visual effects and lighting make the film feel a lot gloomier than it needs to be and make it confusing for a viewer who is not familiar with the work as to what is happening.  I spent half an hour after the film ended explaining various plot points to a number of viewers what were in the theater.

Nevertheless, despite all of is shortcomings; the film was pleasure to watch.  It is different from what the American viewer is used to.  It also does a fantastic job at introducing a great contemporary sci-fi author and Russian cinematography to the global community.  The special effects, while on the dark side, where superb and served their purpose to keep eyes glued to the screen.  While I am a purist and always prefer the written word to the film adaptation, I must say that even considering my criticism this was well done and is definitely worth seeing.",1163376000,5,1811,4.425981873111782

The movie combines elements of morality and religion.  Sacrifice, betrayal, love, and hope are all presented.  Unlike most of Hollywood's creations, the ending is not what was expected (or could be expected).",1162684800,,512,4.964705882352941

1595878,3,B00005JOYL,"Night Watch is an interesting, imaginative film. The special effects are quite good by Russian film standards, though not particularly new or special by the standards of such films as The Matrix. They're prominent, but they don't drive the film, else it wouldn't be a particularly good film. What does drive the film are plot and an interesting premise.

By now you know both plot and premise, so I won't bother providing a synopsis here. This film has at its core the struggle between good and evil (something we find in most of the literature ever written and most films ever made), but the relationship between the two is a bit unusual. The principal character for good (the Night Watch), Anton, lives across the hall from an agent of evil (the Day Watch) and is on rather chummy terms with him. When good and evil aren't engaged in apocalyptic struggle, they go after each other like bureaucrats and lawyers. An evil witch is arrested by the Night Watch and written up (complete with forms) for black magic against an innocent much like she might expect to be written up for hygiene violations in her restaurant kitchen. The dialogue is nearly along the lines of, ""what, a nice old lady like me? Anyway, this was entrapment!"" ""Yeh, yeh, tell it to the judge."" Anton creates a mini-crisis when, rather than arrest a vampire, he kills him. His Day Watch neighbor, also a vampire, is put out and affronted by this, not driven into a vengeful rage. Seldom has the war between good and evil seemed so civilized.

This film is very Russian. The attitudes of the characters and the modus operendi of the Day and Night Watches have a certain post-Soviet weariness to them, a certain sense of sloppiness. The chuminess I noted above is part of that. If the war between good and evil is bureaucratic and tame, it's because both sides are morally lax. There's no sense of outrage for good or evil done, no sense that ends can't be justified by means. When a good but cursed woman seems set to set off the apocalypse, the leader of the Night Watch (a good guy, an agent of Light, remember) tells his operatives to find a way to lift the curse or kill her for the greater good. Agents of good and evil seem to operate on the basis of rational utilitarian concerns, not on irrational principle. It's a perspective that seems very much conditioned by Soviet theory and practice.

Parts of the movie were confusing. Some sequences were so sudden or frenetic that I had no clue what had just happened. It's nice to be able to go back and rewatch them (though in a couple of cases I'm as baffled as I was the first time), but this is still confusing. There are some plot holes that are flung past us so quickly that the director may hope we don't notice, and in some cases he's probably right. There are some surprises that are entirely unsurprising (I figured out the identity of the Great Other and his or her (no spoilers from me) relationship to Anton before the Great Other even made it onto the screen), but there are also some genuine surprises and a few good startles.

This isn't a bad film, and in some ways it's quite good. It's Russian. The DVD transfer isn't bad. What I hated about the DVD was that I couldn't figure out how to get Russian dialogue without subtitles, and I had to have English dubbing for several minutes before I got any Russian at all. That's just plain strange. I wouldn't have known I could get Russian language at all if another reviewer hadn't mentioned the problem - a few minutes into the film (before it made the transition) I just switched it to English and got rid of the subtitles. It's also annoying that there are no Russian subtitles. This is a general gripe for me with Russian film DVDs, since I like to show them to my Russian students and like them to be able to read the dialogue as they hear it. Are there no deaf Russians who watch these things?

I'd give this film four stars, but that stupid business of having to have the first minutes in dubbed English and having to have the English subtitles in Russian costs it a star.",1162339200,2,4064,4.5013550135501355

Good thing I didn't watched it dubbed : you really can not translate some dialog into English without loosing the richness of the russian speach.

1595880,1,B00005JOYL,"As a lover of horror films, I was curious about the movie. I rented it (to be on the safe side) and was terribly disappointed/bored. I'd like to give it the benefit of the doubt and say that MUCH was lost in translation. But I suspect that even in the original language, it's ... well, just a mess.

Parts of it are entertaining. Most effects are mediocre (though this shouldn't deter you from a film), very little explanation is given to ""the gloom"" and what it is, the characters are tired and under developed, the plot wandered aimlessly and ... what was up with the evil video game . . . and sword fighting with fluorescent light bulbs? C'mon... everyone knows that a spinal sword can't withstand the might of fluorescence. . . *sigh*

There were decent parts, but mostly ... I envision the writers hanging out with 11yr old goth children, jotting down the kids' random ideas then scattering them onto a story board and working loose dialogue to tie them together.

The director (in the DVD interview extra) sounds almost apologetic in his description of this first installment in the trilogy. I applaud the man for his effort and his well-groomed beard, but I can only hope that this failure has taught him a few valuable lessons and that the next two installments will see a drastic overall improvement.

1595881,3,B00005JOYL,"Konstantin Khabensky. Vladimir Menshov. Valeri Zolotukhin. Mariya Poroshina. Galina Tyunina. These are the stars of 2004's Russian made Nochnoy Dozor...or to us Capitalist Pigs, Night Watch.

By 2005, Night Watch was the highest grossing Russian film ever made....which speaks volumes about the number of movies that come out of Russia and their quality.

Night Watch wasn't a great movie. Night Watch was indeed a good movie, but, man, is it ever good to speak English if you're a film buff that enjoys mostly Hollywood. I don't know how non-English speaking countries don't get tired of reading the subtitles or listening to stiffly dubbed US movies. I went with the subtitles for Night Watch, and by the end of the movie I had a headache.

I don't know if all subtitled films are doing this now because I don't watch many, but in Night Watch the subtitles are sometimes ""integrated"" into the movie as an effect. Sometimes they float around the screen; sometimes they evaporate as a bloody mist; sometimes they flicker...I'm sure that reading this it sounds annoying (or the cause of my headache), but it was actually kind of cool. And the translations were modern slang instead of deadpan.

The sound is great (5.1). The picture is great. Much higher quality than expected from a foreign film. The film is mostly dark lending a comicbookesque/graphic novel atmosphere. The movie looks like it cost a lot more than the worldwide $33MM it grossed. But, hey, prices are a bit different 'over there.'

For those that haven't already deduced from the product description, Night Watch is a Vampire movie...a Guardians of the Light versus the Gloom, if you will. And the story, while familiar, has enough uniqueness to make it certainly worth a try. But, oy, Night Watch is the first in a trilogy, which means two more subtitle headaches are on the way (one of which, Day Watch, is already available on foreign region DVD that won't play on most US DVD players).

So if you can deal with subtitles (or poorly dubbed dialogue), and you're into the genre, slip into the Gloom and visit this place that only the Others can go. But bring a flashlight!",1161216000,,2143,4.825613079019074
1595882,4,B00005JOYL,"When I think of Russian films, I think of Russian novels -- six hundred pages of sulking -- I don't think of action. When I saw this in the rental store, I got it right away. I didn't know what to expect from a Russian 'action' film, especially one dealing with western-style supernatural themes. I was pleasantly surprised.

If you want gore and non-stop action, this is not your film. It is moody and mildly depressing (in a Russian way, not a Woody Allen way) but a great deal of fun. I got into it right away, and loved most of it. I didn't see the point of not allowing the airplane to land, until I thought of where the airport might be. An airport right in the middle of a populated area wouldn't be able to let an airplane land when there was no visibility and the possibility of a tornado to boot. They should have just left the airplane out, or put someone of importance (another Light Other? a key Dark Other?) on board. It could be deleted with no harm. And at the end, the guy should have just said ""Wait. You aren't telling the whole truth. You tricked me"" or something to that effect. But all in all, I will watch this film more than once.

Many of the reviewers who did not like the film sounded like they're in their early 20s, especially when reading their other reviews. This film might not appeal to that generation because it is slow, there is little blood and gore (thank God. Nothing more boring than a slasher film), lots of plot, lots of mood. This isn't what our studios are cranking out, and the difference will take getting used to, if all you know is U.S. blockbuster trash.

Rent the video and see it in both English and Russian with subtitles. Be aware: the Russian starts out in English. It does change languages at last. The dubbed version (speaking English) is kind of cheesy but still okay. If you aren't sure about watching foreign-language films, watch the English. It isn't terrible.

I do wish there was more on why dark is evil and light is good. Both drink blood and both feed on humans. Perhaps the book tells more (oh goody ... another book to find and read!).

I really liked this film, but then, in most films I fast-forward through car chases, fights and 'action sequences,' stopping for plot and conversation.",1160697600,,2256,4.4396135265700485

Secondly, there are several ""directorial decision"" moments in this movie.  Many of the characters remain the same, but the story changes.  In the book Anton isn't ever married, he never has a child, and he falls in love with Svetlana, that's why he was destined to save her from the black vortex that she summomed on herself.  Egor, Anton's son in the movie, is a simple child, he has some power, and he will probably become an Other, but his destiny was not decided.  Not by the gods, not by a witch trying to kill him, not by Anton telling him the truth, not by Zabulon manipulating things to be the way he wants them.  I'd suggest to anyone who things this is a great movie to read the book, you'll be amazed how much better the book is, and you'll get to find out what (basically) is going to happen in the other two movies, though they did shy away from the book for the second movie (titled Day Watch).

I like that the film starts with holes in the story, and back fills them as the film unfolds.

 The story is portraid in a fashion that allows our hero to be human, with failings, suffering injuries. He is no Superhero, just someone struggling to do their best given the circumstances.

 I was a little confused as to why it was offered with Russian dialogue and french subtitles. But the simple fact is, I liked it right from the start.

 The director shows that you do not need to go overboard with special effects to get the point across, and tell the story. That's not to say the effects were bad or missing.

1595917,4,B00005JOYL,"""Night watch"" is a very good a adaptation of a fantasy novel of the same name, written by Sergey Lukyanenko. This original but extremely strange Russian film was directed by Timur Bekmambetov, and has a sequel (""Day watch"") that allows us to follow the adventures of the characters.

The main premise of this movie is that there are people with supernatural powers called ""Others"" that live among human beings. The ""Others"" are very different, and are neatly divided into the opposing forces of Light and Dark according to their characteristics and beliefs. The soldiers of Light (NightWatch) Project human beings, and the soldiers of Dark (DayWatch) prey on them. These two forces don't get on well with each other, but have striken an uneasy truce in order to survive. That truce won't last forever, though, as both sides are waiting for the person that will break the balance to be born and chose sides... ""Night watch"" tells us what happens at that turning point...

On the whole, I can say that I found this film entertaining and interesting, despite the fact it has some plot holes. From my point of view, ""Night watch"" deserves at least 3.5 stars, due to the fact that even though it isn't excellent, it is good enough to surprise even the most jaded spectator, and to make him eager to watch the sequel.

1595920,5,B00005JOYL,"Night Watch is a refreshing take on the good versus evil battle, without yawning anthologies and preaching as its concise, to the point and draws the watcher in and doesn't let go unless some scenes are so obscure that you need to pause the TV and sit there and ponder the images that seared the brain. It's part one of a grand trilogy taking place in modern Moscow, unknown's to the humans there, a breeding ground for shape shifters who can turn into bears and tigers, vampires, sinister cursed characters who tangle innocent people into the never ending battle between the lines of good and evil.

The story starts off with a young man Anton, who visits an extremely creepy old woman in a red suit, who tells him that his wife is having an affair and that she bears a child that isn't his. Crimes of lust and passion aren't new but this take on them is quite extraordinary as he pays the witch to get the woman back and to abort the child. While she falls into a demon like trance he changes his mind and something weird happens as he sees invisible forces holding her down as she tries to slap her hands together to kill his child. He realizes that the traumatic experience in her house changes him forever, as the world is still weird and unchanged, but now visible to him in its pure and ancient form. From a visual view the movie is a work of art; a cinematic achievement that kept me bewildered and pondering each scene, as the most incredible things crept and crawled through it. Plastic dolls that grew legs of a spider, vortex of black crows circling over a building where a doomed and cursed woman lived, as everything she touched died and her role in this movie. Powerful warriors who pulled swords form the spinal cords and who fought battles against light wielding Others who believed in good, moving through a dark mist called the Gloom. It paralyzed its pray from inside out, sucking blood out of its veins through mosquitoes and hordes of warriors in their mythical costumes, with winged helmets battling on the bridge in Moscow but in a different universe unseen by regular humans.

There is a tale of a special Other, a person who will tip the scales, as Anton gets involved he releases that the person who will influence man kind forever is tied to him and his past, and he must travel though obstacles greater than human mind can bear to get to the vortex and its final resolution. The images and fantasy in this movie were spellbinding and so well though out as the story was captivating and entertaining and certainly wild!

The movie was superb, every angle and screen shot was perfect and amazing, the flying and fighting, the mystery and the creatures fed my eyes for two hours as I am impatiently awaiting the second installment of this amazing fairy tale like movie. In a nutshell this movie is about Anton and his group of fellow strange creatures who look like harmless humans who keep tabs on the evil ones, who try to trick the good side to commit crimes so great, that the best of the good ones will switch sides.

The visual effects are appealing to a degree, but the constant erratic motion of the camera along with the confusing shifting of scenes and sequences left me feeling motion sick.  The beginning of the movie had me hopeful with its interesting visuals, though the dialog was somewhat lacking no matter which language I watched it in.  However, for all the cool effects they tried to hype it up with the movie was sadly actionless.  I don't mean that it didn't measure up the kung-fu fight sequences of the matrix or its stunning camera work, I mean there was little or no action over the entire course of the film.  The few sequences in the beggining and ending that did entail some forms of battle were just constant camera shifting of people getting their heads bashed in with axes or some other weapon from the dark ages.  For all the boasting of shape shifters, witches, and sorcerers there was no magical or non-mundane action sequences to speak of.  Maybe I should have read the book first, but this movie did not turn out to be what I expected.

1595979,2,B00005JOYL,"Oh, how I wanted the critics to be wrong. The trailer was SO COOL!  Alas...

Night Watch follows (sort of) the battle between the forces of Dark (Day Watch) and Light (Night Watch). The latter include Geser, the stoic leader; Olga, a white owl who disgustingly turns into a woman; Tiger Cub, a rather more attractive woman who can turn into (you guessed it) a tiger cub; Bear, a big burly Russian who can (so we're told) turn into a (yes) bear. At the center of the Night Watch forces is Anton, he of the normal name, who is a little too dark and tortured for an agent of the Light. In fact, the same can be said for all of the above, making one wonder if there is, after all, any hope for the world.

The story is, at best, oblique. It can be very difficult to follow, not because of the language translation, and most of the time, it doesn't feel worth the effort. The visual effects are outstanding, but you can see them distilled down into the 2.5 minute trailer without losing much. Ultimately, the story comes down to that of a father and son caught in the battle between Light and Dark. There is a great effort to make the story poignant and the characters likable. And, Konstantin Khabensky, as Anton, does put forth a strong performance. It's easy to believe that he is a somewhat lost soul looking for something to hold onto, to reinforce his belief in the powers of Light. However, his performance alone will not make the film more endurable. The best advice I can offer to any potential viewer is to quote Anton himself: ""Be careful...damn is not just a word.""",1153699200,4,1572,4.413793103448276
1595980,5,B00005JOYL,"The Russian film industry has vaulted into the age of CGI with a delightful vampire romp that is innovative and technically accomplished.  Aside from anything, the film looks and feels great, and the director's attention to detail goes beyond the abilities of most other reviewers to even notice, or correctly spell their criticism.  One of the most compelling features of the film is its subtitles.  This is not a film to be lazily viewed in a dubbed version, as the subtitles themselves are a major work of art and the innovative technique will be ripped off constantly over the next few years.  The subtitles are an integral part of the film's plot, the words dissolving into blood as a character bleeds, or appearing with a cursor as a computer is utilized on-screen.  At one point the subtitles even pulse in and out to the rhythm of a faltering vampire heartbeat.

About the movie, well it's a vampire flick, basically.  There are other dimensions filled with horrible brutes most of us cannot, and would not want to perceive.  There is a great Russian Batmobile, it's a lumbering army truck with flames shooting out of the exhaust.  Some of the scenes are positively mesmerizing, such as a vampire's view of a boy's skull as a network of blood vessels something akin to an MRI.  The cuts are rapid, and jump back and forth between the perspectives of different characters.  Movies are getting faster, have more cuts and more persepectives, and Night Watch is at the forefront of a trend that will test the perceptual ability of an unprepared viewer.

Night Watch would be a great pick for a surprise best foreign language Oscar in much the same way that Pulp Fiction surprised at Cannes.",1153699200,,1694,4.763698630136986

i know the directors intentions were to give the audience a feeling of how the characters probably felt as the circumstances were occurring, but it just didn't work. it was like watching a strobe light only with images instead of light and dark.

as for the storyline, i loved the way they intertwined the witches, shape-shifters, vampires, and whatever else some of these beings were supposed to be. it was like an alternate reality vaguely resembling that of the movie Constantine. although is was sort of distracting watching this russian film in english with the dubbing not that great and all the street/building signs in russian, it was still entertaining and worth at least a look by anyone who is a fan of fantasy.",1153526400,,1110,4.836842105263158

It's defiantly a love it or hate it type of movie. Night Watch avenges the cliched genre of battles between good and evil. In fear of killing your hope for the movie, for I feel that I will make it sound utterly horrid I will leave simply my opinion.

I  had been expecting more blood and guts and overused effects, however I was pleasantly surprised that this movie was focused around the story(who would have thought.)  Though it's is classified as a horror film it follows much closer to an action/phantasy theme and still maintains it's uniqueness. With every ""Other"" possessing a unique attribute, some which we never get to see, it leaves you yearning for more, paving an excellent path for the following two movies.

This is a kind of rare film that portraits an ethernal battle between the forces that govern light and darkness. The battle begun many centturies ago over a bridge where both armies clashed. Seing that the balances of their forces were even and that only the total annihilation of both sides will end the battle, both sides signed a truce. Now in modern day Moscow member of both sides live among humans, and are known as ""The Others"". The ones supported by the forces of light govern during daylight, while the night belongs to the Dark side of the force (no reference to Star Wars). The dark ""Others"" live as vampires during the night, and there is a ""Night Watch"" patrol run by the light ""others"", and a ""Day Watch"" run by the dark ""Others"". Each side watch each other in order to asure that the conditions set by the truce stays in place.

There is a legend about an specially powerful ""other"" that will be born and forced to take one of the sides, breaking the balance between Light and Dark.

There is something nicely rare about this movie that makes you like it. Maybe is because there so many interesting characters, you will encounter Vampires, Shape-shifters, Witches, Warriors that pull they swords from their spine. A unique collection of characters.

Worth watching. The movie is visually dazzling but creates an intriguing, seductive, and thrilling alternative world that takes place on the streets of Moscow.",1152662400,,1517,4.670411985018727
1596014,3,B00005JOYL,"""Nochnoi Dozor"" aka ""Night Watch"" (2004) is directed by Timur Bekmambetov and based on the cult novel by Sergei Lukyanenko.

This Action / Fantasy / Horror / Thriller begins many centuries ago with the great battle between the forces of Darkness and Light - The Good and the Evil. No one can win that battle and the forces keep truce controlling each other's actions during the Night and Day watch. Skip to Moscow, Russia of 2004 - the balance between the Dark and the Light is just about to collapse because the Chosen one who would either save the world if he joins the Light or destroy it if he goes with the dark forces has been born but does know his destiny yet. Sounds familiar, does it not? ""Lord of the Rings"", ""The Matrix"", ""Star Wars"" - yes, ""Night Watch"", the first entry in the trilogy brings to mind all these celebrated movies but it has very distinguished look and feel to it, ""horror-fantasy-down-and-dirty-Moscow-style"". The film also explores (at least it tries to) Mikhail Bulgakov's ""Master and Margarita"" territory and reminds of the popular Russian cult novel by Vladimir Orlov, ""Danilov the Violist"" in the way both beloved books combine bitter realism of life in Moscow with darkly humorous fantasy. I have to admit that I did not expect much but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was entertaining, funny, and at the same time very dark, unsettling, and gripping. It is not a perfect movie (its director is a little too much in love with the MTV style camera movements and cuts) but it's got many interesting sequences and special effects. The B/W animated part was brilliant and it alone makes the film worth of watching.

Some jokes are hilarious. My favorite was the one about two vampires that fell in love and wanted to enroll in the teaching college together.

P.S. I will certainly watch ""Dnevnoi Dozor"" aka ""Day Watch"" when it becomes available.

1596017,5,B00005JOYL,"_Night Watch_  (_Nochnoi Dozor_) is a bizarre Russian film based on a series of novels which features an epic confrontation between the forces of Light and those of Darkness.  Apparently throughout history there have always been ""Others"", those possessed with supernatural powers (vampires, witches, shapeshifters), who must choose to fight on the side of Light or the side of Darkness.  However, at one point in time a confrontation occurred between these two forces in which armies of Light and Dark led by Generals Gesen and Zavulon fought on a bridge.  However, in order to prevent the complete destruction of all their forces the generals agreed on a truce.  Thus was born the ""night watch"" (the watch over the forces of darkness in the night by the forces of light) and the ""day watch"" (the watch over the forces of light in the day by the forces of darkness) to assure that all laws were followed by the Others and that the truce was not broken.  It is during a confrontation between these two forces that the hero Anton makes his appearance, is revealed as an Other, and chooses the side of Light.  Apparently, Anton had sought the services of a witch to bring his girlfriend back to him and to cause her to miscarry with another man's child; however, at just the moment she is casting her hex upon the child the ""night watch"" appears.  The movie features a dark atmosphere in which Anton must attempt to prevent a vampiress (whose vampire boyfriend he has killed) from sucking the blood of a young boy.  The movie also reveals an ancient curse placed upon a girl, Svetlana, which has caused a vortex to appear drawing all in her path to their destruction.  Ultimately however, the forces of Light must again confront the forces of Dark in an apocalyptic battle in which the chosen Other must choose between Light and Dark.  The movie is certainly strange and while the dubbing into English may appear cheesey, it nonetheless is highly entertaining.  For an apocalyptic Russian film with an eerie atmosphere of supernatural strangeness give it a try and you are sure to enjoy.",1151798400,,2084,4.758333333333334

 Night Watch reminds me of a cross between Underworld and Highlander. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying those two flicks are the greatest, but the concepts.

 I do wish I understood some of it more, but this also makes me think more, which with movies doesn't happen enough.

 Watch this.",1151712000,3,749,4.338129496402877
1596020,2,B00005JOYL,"NIGHT WATCH may have been done in by its own marketing campaign.  Sold to the West as Russia's surprise blockbuster hit with fantastic effects, big-budget flare, and the first part of a planned trilogy or even quadrolgy, the film had its bar raised so high that it ultimately could not reach it in the eyes of this viewer.

I will give them credit for their two main strengths - 1) there are some nice shots and FX in the movie, and 2) there is a whole world created here with plenty of fuel for the planned trilogy.

However, as many nice moments and plot-points as there are, they do not add up to a total satisfying experience.  Either the problem lies with this film being aimed at a Russian audience with a different palate for movie exposition, or the filmmakers are just not able to completely immitate what they have seen from the west.

As a Westerner, I was looking for much more excitement - the action of this movie is shot in a grand STYLE, but is not present in the same ABUNDANCE required for the Blockbusters we are used to here.  As such, the film's few action scenes are pretty boring - reminiscent of a movie from about 20 years ago with some cool elements, but without the means or budget to give them life.

Furthermore, there is just no way to really understand what is going on in each scene.  A fault in the translation, perhaps, but half of the dialogue makes no sense.  The overall thread of the story makes sense ultimately, but it took a long time to follow what was going on in each individual scene.

Then there are some just plain bad mistakes - such as a point in which an owl turns into a woman who seems to have not been human for over 60 years.  As such, we spend a few minutes watching her try to understand what plumbing and soap are for - only to have her emerge from her bath a few seconds later and state, ""Oh - I've been aching for a hot shower for 60 years!""  For the remainder of the movie, she seems to know more about her surroundings and what's going on than the hero himself does.

Then, the full nature of the supernatural beings is never quite understandable.  Are they created as ""Others,"" or do they start as human and then BECOME Others after a pivotal event occurs?  If they are now supernatural, why do they still bleed, sleep, and eat?  Why are the sometimes visible and sometimes not?  We see that they are always fighting - but over what?

As for characters and developement - it is non-existent.  Aside from the main hero, every other character is just in the background - and there are ALOT of characters who had potential to be great - but they simply have few lines and few memorable moments in the movie. In the end, you don't remember any of them - they were just there.

At the end of the movie (if you are still awake), you may be interested enough to anticipate the coming sequels.  I myself am not, considering that the director himself admits that the first film was made for a Russian audience, then surprised him by finding a national audience, and now demanding the new movies consider the global audience.  A further complication is that the third of the series is expected to be produced IN ENGLISH by FOX Studios.  All this means that the three movies are unlikely to have a common feel or direction, but will be influenced by changing demographics, and the interference of a western production studio with their own mentalities.

By and large, this movie had potential, but is ultimately just a conglomeration of ideas taken from better American movies such as UNDERWORLD and BLADE.  And when I can say that THOSE two movies are ""better"" - well, that's just sad!",1151712000,9,3637,4.441265060240964
1596021,2,B00005JOYL,"I first heard about this movie from a review from the AV Club, which, though it wasn't exactly singing this movie's praises, still interested me because this movie is supposed to be a set-up for subsequent films in a series.  I think about book series like DragonLance and other fantasy-based stuff, and then anime series, and I thought it would be neat to see the beginning of a similar thing working with film.

By the time the movie had ended, however, my feelings were mixed.  A few things just didn't sit right with me, and I didn't know whether or not I wanted to continue the series, considering I was roughly displeased with the characters we were presented.  However, the ending is one of those well-defined cliffhangers that of course has one begging for more despite himself.

Honestly, however, it doesn't hold up well.  Everything this movie does sort of undermines itself in some way.  It's spectacularly visual... but too visual.  Quick-cut editing filled with striking digital effects is used even when unnecessary, thus making the moments that WOULD have been really cool and gripping just another part of movie.  It tries to have a strong theme about light and darkness, but really it just assumes too much about the audience: it never really shows until the end why light is ""good"" and darkness is ""bad"", it just assumes the audience assumes it... and honestly I didn't see why either side mattered, or why they were even fighting, any further than the opening narration just TOLD me they were.  Finally, they present the action through the experiences of a young man who has difficulty dealing with and understanding this new world he's thrown into (having discovered he's an ""Other"" later in life), but his ""confusion"" comes off more as stupidity, really... and that's the key problem with this movie.  Had this one character, apparently the main protagonist and the character we're supposed to think about, had one ounce of critical thinking skills, he could have reversed the entire storyline for all of the subsequent films.

Once again we're presented with a film that is so familiar with genre conceits that it no longer takes the time to understand them, thus resulting in a story where next to nothing actually stands up to the question ""Why?""  Why was that sub-plot about the woman with the curse really there, anyway (besides that it makes a contrivance for the main guy to leave)?  Why did Bear and Tigercub just randomly decide to start making out and stop paying attention to that kid (besides that the story needed a way for the kid to leave)?  Why did we focus, or care, about that plane, and why wouldn't an airfield allow a DAMAGED PLANE to land (besides that it adds suspense to a part of the movie that doesn't need it)?  And, finally, why do we keep cutting to close-ups of... nothing?  An engine firing off, squeeling tires, sunglasses, ""cool"" imagery (besides the fact that it makes the movie ""kick butt"").  Why are they even ""light"" and ""dark"" at all (besides the fact that then we have a simple one-dimensional good-vs-evil narrative).

All of these things and more would be acceptable, however, if they actually lead somewhere.  However, the one big subplot basically ends with, ""Okay I did it but I'm done now,"" and the main ""twist"" could have easily ended simply with, ""But that woman tricked me, so the decision was really out of my control.""  Oh gee, look at that, I just one-uped the main protagonist... the same guy who blindly follows almost every single thing everybody tells him to do, even when it's CLEARLY A TRAP.

Yes, it might be fun to watch but it doesn't really stand up well to any second thoughts and probably even worse to second viewings.  If you want to enjoy this, which you can, just don't think about it after you're done.  It'll be better that way.

A note on the DVD: I try to always watch a film in its original language with subtitles if needed.  This disc is double-sided with an English dub on one side and a Russian 5.1 Dolby track on the other.  However it's confusing because it starts out with an English narration, which confused me and had me playing around with language and subtitle options for a good while before I found out that I didn't need to.  Then the subtitles were annoying anyway, picking up the ""effects"" of the movie going on.  It was an interesting idea, but it made watching the movie just that much more tiresome to pick up the subtitles before they were faded, wiped, changed colors, or whatever out of sight.

1596022,4,B00005JOYL,"""For it is easier to kill the Light within oneself, than to scatter the Darkness around. The prophecies are coming true...""

So goes one of the most stirring lines of ""Night Watch,"" a tight, atmospheric, slightly surreal fantasy that has the distinction of being one of the most successful movies in Russian history. Full of mages, shapeshifters and witches, this movie spins a compelling battle between good and evil. Think ""Star Wars,"" but with vampires.

Long ago, two armies of powerful Others fough -- and came to a stalemate. To maintain the balance between the Light and Darkness, the Night Watch and Day Watch were created, to keep an eye on each other's sides. But it seems that the balance between good and evil is about to be tipped, by a prophesied Other who will choose one side.

And now it seems to be happening: the prophesied boy has been found, and a vortex with a mystery girl is heading toward Moscow.  Anton (Konstantin Khabensky) has to find the boy and turn him toward the side of light, while repelling the Dark Ones. But he is not the only one, and soon the pact is cracking as both sides try to get the kid.

Be warned: ""Night Watch"" doesn't really end so much as stop. There are two more movies -- one of which is already out in Eastern Europe -- which continue and finish the story. Remember ""Lord of the Rings""? It's like that, so don't expect everything neatly wrapped up at the end. It's has a satisfactory stopping place, but with lots of plot threads awaiting ""Day Watch.""

In plot, it has the fantasy staples -- a prophecy, secret organizations, a savior, a reluctant hero, an ancient clash between good and evil. But it takes place in an urban-gothic Moscow full of the supernatural, but with the grimy, downbeat look that you'd expect from Moscow. It also gives an imaginative twist on the typical vampire legends. (Check out the Gloom!)

Timur Bekmambetov is brilliant stylistically, with tense dialogue, bizarre (sometimes very gory) fights, and fast-moving action scenes. He seems to include anything he thinks is cool, which is fine for the witches, shapeshifters, and a dose of religious symbolism. But occasionally it's a drawback, since it doesn't really make sense that these uberpowerful heroes would need swords to fight the bad guys.

Additionally, he can give twists to the typical, such as a fight between Anton and a Dark One, with both combatants in different realities and able to see each other only through broken mirrors. It's a wild scene, and one of the most suspenseful, unique action sequences you'll see for ages.

Khabensky is a very solid actor, and he brings a pathos to Anton. The only problem is that it takes a long time for Anton to finally develop as a character, although it's worth waiting for. And while there are lots of supporting characters, Bekmambetov gives them weaknesses and quirks of their own, such as the owl-sorceress who seems to have a thing for Anton.

Dark, grimy, explosive and very weird, ""Night Watch"" overflows with cinematic promise. Here's hoping that ""Day"" and ""Dusk"" are as good as this.",1151539200,2,3082,4.76547842401501

In all honesty other than a few really cool special effects driven scenes, it really does talk you to death. It has alot of ideas, and throws them all at you. Unlike ""The Matrix"" which throws spectacular action at you as well, ""Night Watch"" is content with just explaining alot of ""apocalyptic"" stuff to you, not backing much of it up with good action.

1596068,5,B00005JOYL,"Some early reviews have stated incorrect information regarding the subtitle status of this movie. In fact this DVD has so many features when it comes to audio and subtitle selection that it can be confusing. This is my review of these options in hopes of making it all understandable.

This DVD release is a single disc DVD release but the DVD has information on both sides. Side 1 is dual layer whereas Side 2 is single layer.

It is easier if I describe SIDE 2 before I describe SIDE 1 so here goes ...

SIDE 2 OF THE DVD:

This side has the much celebrated animated subtitles which have been burned into the image. They are not selectable meaning they cannot be turned off. This was the only way to do the subtitles due to the animated and varied nature of the subtitles. If you haven't seen the movie yet then this will make sense once you watch this version.

This side has 5.1 Dolby Digital Russian audio although when there is voice-over (like at the beginning of the film) the voice-over is in English but all characters are in the original Russian. The only other audio on this side is the audio commentary by the director who thankfully speaks English very well.

Now there are a variety of subtitle options that can be turned on and off. These usually appear at the top of the screen so as not to interfer with the burned-in animated subtitls.

1.) English for the hearing imparied. This is like Closed Captioned subtitles. They don't repeat the already burned in subtitles [except for the voice-over stuff which is fully subtitled here) but add to the already burned in subtitles by saying [BUZZING] ... [DOOR LOCK CLICKS] ... [PHONE RINGING] ... and other CC type stuff.

2.) French subtitles

3.) Spanish subtitles

4.) Subtitle Commentary by the author of the book NIGHT WATCH on which the film is based on. This is interesting as this ""commentary"" is not verbal but in subtitle form. It is available in English, French and Spanish.

That's it for SIDE TWO.

SIDE 1 OF THE DVD:

This side does NOT have the famous animated subtitles that can be found on SIDE 2 of the DVD. Instead SIDE 1 of the DVD features a 5.1 Dolby Digital English soundtrack. This is of course dubbed as the original film is a Russian language film. Also included are 2.0 Dolby Surround Sound (but not 5.1 DD) audio tracks in French and Spanish.

There are several subtitles options:

1.) English - Full English subs but these are just ""plain"" English subtitles ... not the famous ""animated"" subtitles found on SIDE 2 of the DVD. Not sure why they are here since this side of the DVD has no Russian but an English dub soundtrack which makes these English subtitles a bit useless.

2.) English for the hearing impaired. This is the same as the English subtitles above but adds Closed Captioned information like [DOG BARKING] ... [PHONE RINGING] ... [BEEPING] ... and other CC type stuff.

3.) Spanish subtitles.

To sum things up SIDE 1 of the DVD is only for those that want to watch the film with either an English dub, French dub or Spanish dub. SIDE 2 is the side you really want to watch as it has Russian dialog with the famous ""animated"" English subtitles and even has selectable English hearing impaired subs.

SIDE 1 is SPECIAL though in that it has some extra ""bonus"" stuff not on SIDE 2 which I will detail now:

1.) THE ROOF (Extended Ending). Unlike the movie (which is 16x9 WS on both sides) this bonus scene is presented in a letterboxed 4:3 ratio. It has several audio and subtitle options which include:

A.) 5.1 Russian

B.) 5.1 English

C.) Director Commentary (speaking English)

There are also subtitle options here including English, French or Spanish. These are simple selectable non-animated subtitles.

Also on this side is a short video called NIGHT WATCH TRILOGY which is short but interesting as the director talks about the first film and it's appeal outside of the Russia and briefly talks about the second film and a proposed ""direction"" the third film may take. All too brief though.

We also get trailers for BROKEN SAINTS (some animated film I never heard of that looks interesting), THE HILLS HAVE EYES (the remake) and lastly a short trailer for some fall TV show comming to FX called THIEF.

Last but not least is a video called INSIDE LOOK which turns out to be nothing more than a teaser type trailer for the remake of THE OMEN. Why this is called INSIDE LOOK on the menu is anyone's guess.

Anyways that is all she wrote ... hope this is helpfull to you!",1151107200,19,4480,4.56625
1596069,3,B00005JOYL,"The theatrical release of Night Watch was a fantastic movie, containing Russian dialogue with the most unique subtitles I have ever seen. Unfortunately, Fox has only released this ""dumbed down"" version in the US. They pulled the same stunt with the Australian release, saying that they may release a special edition later. I own the UK release which is far superior to this one, offering the full russian with real subtitles, as well as a special disc that offers the theatrical subtitles. When I watched it in Russian it was very easy to follow the subtitles and the emotional tone that was provided in the Russian language edition truly helped the story. I wish the US release would offer this and let's hope that Fox agrees someday.

The special effects in the movie are excellent. Other countries understand that special effects should add to the story, not become the story. If you only need someone to transform into a tiger for a couple seconds, then that's all you need. Too many American producers would milk it out far longer than it would be useful for just to get a certain level of coolness. The effects here are focused to adding to the story, not becoming it.

This was a fantastic movie though it suffers from some re-editing and dialog that seems to have been changed for no reason even though the cultural idioms still work.

Bottom line, rent it first. If you like it enough, buy this version. If you see the potential in the movie, wait to see if Fox releases a special edition as this movie is excellent but suffers greatly from the treatment Fox has given it.",1151107200,6,1581,4.639285714285714
1596070,4,B00005JOYL,"Night Watch (Nochnoi Dozor)- Night Watch is a cross between The Lord of the Rings, Underworld, and Men in Black.  Night Watch uses a Lord of the Rings type battle scene in flashback to explain the back story of Night Watch.

The action then moves to Moscow (circa 1992).  Then the story becomes a cross between Underworld, and Men in Black.

Night Watch is the first Russian fantasy movie after communism.  The director says, ""Night Watch is the reflection of American culture, (meaning movies) through Russian eyes.""

When American colleagues complemented the director on the design  of the world for the movie Night Watch, he said, ""this is really reality.  I couldn't make this stuff up.  This is really just Russia through Russian eyes, (minus the vampires of course.)  This in reality, is just the Russian take on storytelling.

Overall, I would say that Night Watch is a good movie, about the struggle between good and evil.  You can categorize it as urban fantasy, which is why I compare it to Underworld.

The movie takes place between two parallel worlds.  The world of Faerie (which the movie calls The Gloom), and our world.

The movie is interesting, because we get to see cultural differences in storytelling between Russia and the United States.

So if you like fantasy movies, horror movies with vampires, or movies about alternate reality.  I'd like to suggest that you give Night Watch (Nochnoi Dozor) a try.

The director, sometimes struggles to get his point across in the commentaries, but he eventually does so.  I believe this is mostly due to the difficulty speaking US English for someone who has not been born here.

The writer's subtitled commentary is also interesting, and it adds to the DVD.  The dubbed version of the film, which is on the side of the disc with the red ring is also well done.  The DVD is double-sided.  There are different special features on each side of the disc.",1151107200,3,1913,4.782874617737003
1596071,1,B00005JOYL,"I'm honestly speechless. I've never seen a movie so over-hyped in my life - there are no action sequences (unless u consider quick-cutting to random screams & close-up shots of open eyeballs 'action'), the special effects are lame (when they even show up - watch the trailer and u'll see all there is to see of the tiger woman - a whole 2 seconds!), and the acting wooden. I'm a big fan of B movies, but it really pisses me off when a film as bad as this gets so much attention and truly great movies like 'the descent' go relatively unnoticed. The film isn't even cheesy in a good way - there are no cool monster designs, no witty one-liners, really no action or gore, and, worst of all, it is actually trying to be serious with its hokey plot. You get a certain amateur charm with most B movies, but for some reason the ones that always seem to be pressing for attention end up just looking ridiculous. And is it just me, or is the whole quick-cutting/fast-forward movement of characters getting REALLY old?! I mean honestly, how many times can you get 'freaked out' by seeing someone stand still for a silent moment, then suddenly thrust their hand up on a mirror with the fast-forward effect? The first I remember seeing this in was Resident Evil, where the camera cut suddenly to the little red girl with her hand on the glass and her eyes open. I've seen it in almost every single big-name horror movie since then, though, and these pathetic attempts at portraying a shattered psyche or frenetic movements are getting REALLY lame. Doesn't anyone recognize a tired device anymore? A good example of this is during the scene where the main character tries to revive a little kid (why he passed out and was suddenly covered in ash makeup, I couldn't say). Cheesy glow-in-the-dark spider veins showed up all over his body for no reason, and the camera suddenly goes on a frenzy, darting into one of the veins and then careening around wildly inside the kid's blood vessels. We see a shirt button fall 'ominously' through the darkness and slice several ribbons, and then we cut to a mosquito sucking blood from a transluscent pool. Wow, great stuff guys. Suddenly the kid is revived, and he doesn't seem the least bit surprised that he's suddenly now a ghoul, or 'Other' (original, huh). As for the action sequences, there were none. I don't recall a single fight, save for the ultra-cheesy medieval swordfight in the beginning (and replayed during the end for the climax). Bunch of the cast dressed up in either fur or silver armor, running at each other with swords. Wow. Epic, lemme tell ya. Oh, and there's the climactic fight - the villain pulls his spine out of his back (in a cheesy sequence with obvious dyed rubber) and doesn't do a damn thing with it. This villain and the main character have perhaps the lamest sword duel ever captured on film. It cuts between the main character weilding a massive blacklight bulb like a maniac, to the villain slamming his sword into the ground over and over. Isn't this guy supposed to be the king of darkness or something? And wasn't he an accomplished warlord? His swordsmanship was totally unconvincing, not to mention the fact that neither sword actually seemed to clash during the duel - they just dodged and swung, repeatedly. There's no resolution to this either - the little kid mentioned earlier just runs into the fray and suddenly the fight stops, and it's revealed that the child has strayed onto the dark path. It really took a lot for me to finish this flim, because I desperately wanted to turn it off about halfway through...but I just had to see what all the hype was about, and form my own honest opinion. In summation, I honestly don't see a single redeeming quality in this - hell, at least underworld had monsters and action. This is basically just a bad plot with some ultra-cheesy 'new-wave' horror effects thrown in as (bad) eye candy. If you really want to watch a special effects-laden, action-filled monsterfest, go check out blade, underworld, hellboy, or van helsing. Classics they ain't, but at least there's some entertainment to be found.",1151107200,9,4118,4.665749656121045

1596126,5,B00005JOYL,"This is the first time I have been inspired to write an Amazon review. I finally bought the U.S. release of Nochnoy dozor, which has turned out to be one of my most favorite movies. However I was very upset to find that this release is completely different than the original Russian version. The U.S. version of Night Watch is a bit hard to follow. The explanation of Others and the Great Battle at the beginning was excellent, but it quickly goes downhill when scenes are inserted that throw the movie totally off course. There's very little of the dark humor that was shown in the Russian cut, and what happened to Ignat?

The U.S. release portrays Night Watch to be some sort of unfeeling, straight action movie in the vein of Underworld. Anyone wishing to experience the full effect of Night Watch should do themselves a favor by getting the original version.",1150848000,11,863,4.640522875816994
1596127,5,B00005JOYL,"Finally, a movie in which the dark, fantastical elements are reduced in favor of a gritty, morally ambiguous story driven by plot & characters rather than stars & production values. This movie is everything that 'Constantine' should have been - lean, inventive & compelling.

  To be honest, part of what made it compelling for me was having a look at another culture; especially one that was the Big super-power that the U.S. used to be at odds with during the cold war. Modern Russian pop-culture seems largely unknown here.

  But in the end, it was the story's larger themes & subtext that won me over - themes that are universal. In the end, it's not about good vs. evil, but about individuals being damned if they do / damned if they don't & the sad, tragic longing that somtimes comes with the consequences of the decisions they make.

  It only helps that it's presented in a fresh way by people who were obviously inspired and resourseful. Instead of Hollywood's watered-down stuff, I'll take a shot of straight Vodka, thanks.",1150761600,,1035,4.737430167597766
1596128,4,B00005JOYL,"I'm not going to comment on the film in general, since there are lots of reviews that have already done that.  I enjoyed it quite a bit -- a nice and inventive twist on supernatural/superhero/good vs. evil themed films, with the advantage that cultural differences between the United States and Russia make this one feel a bit more quirky than the usual fare.  While the film is obviously inspired by post-Matrix Hollywood sci-fi, its story and style are distinctive enough, and dark enough, to render it convincing that they come from a world apart from L.A., that conveys (in allegorical fashion) aspects of the tensions in Moscow that have emerged in the post-Soviet era.  The most obvious thematic connection to its time and place -- but one this film also has in common with the best American film-noir -- is the way in which the film shows it can't be taken for granted that the ""lawless"" are evil while the ""enforcers of law"" are good (even when they describe themselves in that way).  While the plot is not nearly as difficult to follow as some of the early reviews suggested, the film is at least willing (unlike many major Hollywood blockbusters) to assume that the audience is not composed of idiots who can't put two and two together.  Easily as enjoyable (and maybe a bit more profound, given that it plays with ambiguities more effectively and is more unpredictable and inventive) as films like ""Blade"" ""Blade II"" ""Hell Boy"",and even some of the Batman films, and much better than much more expensive films like ""Van Helsing"" or ""Chronicles of Riddick"".

One thing I really liked about this film, that I haven't seen a lot of commentary on, is its inventive use of subtitles.  This is one of the first subtitled films I've seen to actually do something interesting with them -- to let them carry some of the weight of the design rather than merely slap them on over the top of the film.  Sometimes they change the color, to fit themes (e.g. red and dripping lettering, or blood red letters that dissipate like blood in water; or subtitles in other colors to match the composition of a shot), or they flicker or they are placed in different parts of the screen rather than merely at the bottom.  This is something you see in a few early silent films, where intertitles are sometimes used in interesting ways, but I don't recall seeing this in any foreign films with subtitles.",1150761600,3,2389,4.682577565632458

1596131,5,B00005JOYL,"I had stumbled onto the trailer to this epic about two years ago by accident when I downloaded it off the internet.  Immediately I was stunned by just the short clips I saw and was even more amazed when the credits flashed at the end and they were written in Russian! A movie that encompasses several genres with no big Hollywood names or actors/actresses attached and showcases some of the most original cinematography I had ever seen?  How can this movie not be good?  I waited and waited...1 year had passed and still nothing...small tidbits filter back that this movie was smashing all records over in Russia, beating North American glam movies like Spiderman and Lord of the Rings... everywhere I asked or talked about it no one knew what the hell I was talking about...then I hear that the studios are translating it over for a North American release ( the first thing that went thru my head was they are going to screw with it too much and end up butchering it..)

  FINALLY IT ARRIVES!!!!!!  I can honestly say its been forever since a movie got my blood racing just off a preview but this one did and then some.  I went to Nightwatch opening night and as the movie started I began to freak out because the first lines from the narrator are in English and not Russian!!  Noooo they dubbed over the Russian actors voices and it won't be subtitled, but much to my relief they did indeed keep the original actors voices and it was subtitled ( This is a huge annoyance when studios voice over instead of subtitles, if they wanted it in English they would have filmed it in English!)

  This movie destroyed any and everything that I had seen in the last ten years.  It took an age old theme and put a kickass twist on it, the effects were great but what made them stand above anything over here is the attention to detail and being creative with the use of the special F/X.  ( the little boy getting a bleeding nose underwater was cool..)  and speaking of detail for us narrow minded fools that don't speak Russian what they did with the subtitles was frigging brilliant, when someone spoke the subtitles went up on screen, but if someone walked in front of them they disappeared, if an actor read something off the computer screen the dialogue appeared as computer written(undrescore included ).  The thing that I also love so much about this movie is that even tho its dealing with all of these fantasy/sci-fi etc.  elements it still delivers a complete taste of Russian culture and essence of its people and to me that kicked ass hardcore and because of this there is no way I could see this movie being made anywhere else in the world or by any other people in the world.  I love you all for giving  me this experience.  HA!

  This movie was beyond and above all my expectations. The fact that this is a trilogy just creates more anticipation.

I have to wait how long to see the final chapter? !@%#$#&*$! but its all good.  I now know there is a book which is awesome and will definitely buy and read.  Bottomline this is a movie that you will either totaly get and fall in love with or you won't ""get it"" if your of the latter then take off, I think I hear hollywood calling your name, something about Spiderman 14, or X-men 5, King Kong 8 etc.

  So ya damn Ruskies ya won me over and then some!! Not only did I love this movie but I went out of my way to tell everyone about it, so when this beauty comes out on DVD hell ya I'm  buying it.

  Like it or hate it? I'm level enough to leave my email address if ya want to let me know what u think...sscheck@hotmail.com

1596183,5,B00005JOYL,"Others are those wizards, sorcerers, witches and shapechangers among us, locked in combat between those dedictaed to the Light and Dark. Generals Gesen and Zavulon command the forces of Others dedicated to Light and Darkness, respectively. On a bridge, the two armies meet, and a truce is struck to prevent to annihilation of all Others in that combat. Both sides wait for the birth of an Other whose choice of sides will decide the end to their struggle.

In 1992, Anton, a mild mannered man, meets a modern witch in her apartment to have her cast a spell to retun his lost love to him. She warns him that his love is now pregnant with another man's child, and that this child will constantly draw Anton's love back to the other man, unless it is also destroyed. However, the witch will only attempt to destroy the child if Anton agrees to accept the responsibility of that act. In the botched process of casting the spell to destroy the unborn child, he awakes to the uneeen world around him, becoming an Other.

In 2004, Anton has chosen the Light side, and is hunting vampires and other Dark siders in Moscow, using his special Gift as a Seer. Ironically, he lives next door to a vampire, and they share a wary but friendly relationship. Interestingly, the Light is in the habit of providing special licenses to Dark siders, allowing them to kill/feed/convert/etc., but each side polices the activities of the other to make certain that the Truce is never broken. During an intervention, Anton kills the vampire lover of a young girl, recently ""turned"", saving a young boy in the process, but effectively violating the peace. He also encounters Svetlana, something ""much worse than a vampire"", but who is wholly unaware of her role in apocalyptic events about to unfold.

This unique film brings a Russian artistic and cultural approach to a story that seems straight out of a graphic novel. While the story itself may not be unique, seeming pretty much standard Gaiman or Vertigo fare, the production is stunning. The director uses camera angles, and incorporates photographic and artistic elements I've never seen, and the effect is enthralling. It's not a film based on big pyrotechnic explosions and gunfire, and the Special Effects aren't totally up to Dreamworks standards, but the film is a lush portrait of the struggle between good and evil, as well as the tendency of each walking those paths to cross over to the others point of view, that puts recent films of similar theme (Underworld 1/2, Constantine, Van Helsing) in 2nd place.",1147564800,107,2546,4.821510297482837

I've seen many movies set in Russia, but none made by Russian filmmakers.  Admittedly, I ignorantly never thought there was a Russian film industry.  Boy, was I wrong.  This is a fantastic start to a trilogy.  It's artistic with great cinematography, but not too artsy.  It has great action sequences without falling into the normal Hollywood trappings (our hero is a reluctant anti-hero). It has humourous moments without becoming idiotic.  There is something in each character that makes them plausible and real.

I agree with the reviewer who said if you like creatures of the night not necessarily Vampires (there's a witch in the beginning leading me to believe there will be more in Day Watch) and you liked the Matrix, you've hit pay dirt with this movie.  Also, I have to say, storywise it isn't that original.  It's the struggle between light & dark forces.  That is far from original.

Despite the fantastical premise, do not expect this to be a glossy, action-packed, overblown, live-action cartoon. The atmosphere is dark and very grim. The violence and content are unflinching and the whole thing plays out more like a deep, epic horror movie rather than your usual fantasy fare.

That said, the special effects are stunning, with even the sub-titles being incorperated into the cinematography!

It's also a good idea to pay attention as the characters and sub-plots are numerous, but important, not only to this, but also (I imagine) to the rest of the trilogy.

""Night Watch"" is the closest any film has come since ""The Matrix"" to completely knocking me on my ass on the fisrt viewing.  There is so much awesomeness in this movie, that you can almost feel the rest of the trilogy building as this first installment goes on.  The story is so well crafted, the action so exhilarating, and the themes and concepts put forth so fresh that the few flaws are easily brushed aside in favor of total immersion into this new world. The story centers around the war between light and dark.  The light side has a special organization, Night Watch, who monitor the dark ones even as the dark side's own Day Watch monitors them.  Both sides have the goal of maintaining peace and order as each man and woman is free to choose which side they will follow.  Needless to say, the truce between the two sides is tentative at best. Each member of the supernatural light/dark battle is referred to as an ""Other"" and they include in their ranks witches, vampires, shapeshifters and all of the other usual horror fare.  They all have the ability to slip into an alternate dimension known as ""The Gloom"" which makes them invisible to the real world except for their reflection in mirrors.  This is used to create some mind-bogglingly awesome and creepy shots.  The characters are many, interesting, and instantly accessible.  Each has a great story behind them, but most are sorely underdeveloped.  This, I'm sure, will be remedied in the next installment.  I mean, how could you not want to see more of a villain who pulls a sword out of his own spine?  Then there's the sexy were-tiger girl (don't blink or you'll miss her awesome tranformation) and a pop-diva who doubles as a Day Watch warrior.  Heck, there's a character who can supposedly change into a bear and it is never even shown in the film.  But you know what they say in show business:  always leave the audience wanting more.  Well, they certainly succeeded on that front.  The best thing about this genre-defying epic is that it really does feel like the tip of the iceberg.  The only true flaw that this film has is some very bad quick-cutting during the action sequences that can be very confusing.  That's pretty much it.  The rest is pure gold as far as I'm concerned.  There is also a wealth of deleted scenes that are well worth watching as they help flesh out the story. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen a DVD with more deleted scenes that I wished had stayed in the film.  If you've been looking for something different and mind-blowing in the horror/sci-fi/fantasy genre then you would be a fool to pass this film by.",1146441600,64,2719,4.572314049586777

1596190,5,B00005JOYL,"A few months ago I purchased a bootleg copy of this movie, still in Russian. This movie was FANTASTIC!!!!! On the same quality level as Blade, this movie blew me away. It is about the struggle between good and evil. It involves Vampires, Demons, Ghouls, and Dark spirits. It is about a man who is supposed to be the one who balances good and evil. He finds a man who turns out to be the ONE, but chooses the side of evil. I sat wide-eyed watching this masterpiece...and the best part is its part 1 of 3.

Buy this movie! You will not forget it!!!

Best Russian film ever!",1145836800,3,571,4.229357798165138
1596191,4,B00005JOYL,"Based on the bestselling fantasy novels by Sergei Lukyanenko who also co-wrote the script, `NOCHNOI DOZOR' (`Night Watch') is the first of the epic fantasy trilogy. Director Timur Bekmambetov, one of the new wave directors from Russia, has actually worked under Roger Corman, king of B-films when he directed an exploitation film named `Arena' in 2001 shot in Russia. That means Bekmambetov is no stranger to the grammars of entertaining B-movies: more actions at the expense of sophisticated storytelling.

Actually, the story about the two conflicting sects of the `Others' - humans with supernatural powers - is sometimes hard to follow, but the film's visuals manage to keep entertaining us. After the opening sequence with a bloody medieval battle between the forces of Light and Darkness, we are told that a shaky truce has been kept for more than 1,000 years.

But the uneasy peace between the two forces is about to be broken in modern Moscow when one ordinary-looking boy is hypnotized and lured by a seductive voice calling `Come to me.' One `Night Watch' (`Light' members monitoring the activities of the Darkness) named Anton (Konstantin Khabensky) tries to stop the mysterious scheme, which leads him to the gory fights between him and very violent Vampire Andrei.

[VISUALS & SUBTITLES] The film is full of (or overcrowded with) visual ideas done by Russian CGI technicians who have shown impressive skills here. You witness each and every movement of a metal rivet falling from the airplane; Anton's aide Olga who is turned into an owl; a lady whose curse unwittingly causes a huge vortex in the sky of Moscow; or a blood-sucking female roaming in the midnight tunnel barefoot. Many parts are left unexplained (who is the guy who overturned the truck?), and the visual images are not exactly all refreshing, but it is undeniable that each image has power of its own, which makes up for the lack of skilled storytelling. Even the English subtitles are unique, occasionally turning red or bigger according to the scenes without detracting our attentions from the film's content.

It was about 25 years when Vladimir Menshov, who plays the role of Geser, Anton's boss here, directed critically acclaimed `Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears' (1979) which went on to become the Oscar winner for Foreign Language Film. Now he is this Russian answer to the Hollywood's alternative world, presented by 20th Century Fox Searchlight. Surely Russia has changed.

Whether or not this trilogy can be called a success depends on the quality of the sequels. So we must wait for the second and third installments `Day Watch' and `Dusk Watch.' The results could be either better than expected, or perhaps disappointing. Whatever they would be, it remains true that `Night Watch' is a promising start for the new cinematic movement in Russia.",1145750400,2,2837,5.040511727078891
