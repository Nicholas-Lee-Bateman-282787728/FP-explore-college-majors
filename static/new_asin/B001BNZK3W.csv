Now speaking about the film...

Its Jazzy music, running through the film, sets the tone for quick
witted dialogue, full of turns, conversations that shouldn't have been
heard, but meant a lot, and basically, dramas from couples which
nevertheless love each other. As Vincent, obviously the character the
director mostly likes, says near the end: ""all important stories are
love stories. But that doesn't mean they are all 'easy going'"" I'm a
fan of Karin Viard. She is constantly on the edge during the trip, but
seems to learn something from the experience. She's very expressive,
any lesser actress wouldn't be convincing at her, yes, hysterical
moodiness. She's beautiful, but the film builds on that image a bit too
much to my taste.

Franois Cluzet's Marc is a great counterbalance to all this ""feeble
humanists"". He's mean, self centered, and incapable of empathy. I liked
his ""successful"" character, specially after seeing him doing ""Antoine"",
the exact opposite ""a childish depressive and broke 'crosswords writer'
for a local magazine"" with the best G. Dpardieu at Les Apprentis
(1995).

Rose-Marie and Caroline are fine, but I would have liked a bit more of
""character development"" for both.

Overall, I loved this movie, felt really well in the end (not the usual
case for French films :)) and would definitely watch it again to get
the subtle dialogue, the ""lapsus"" (Anne always ""breaking a bottle"") and
the sheer enjoyment of two lovable characters who couldn't be more
difficult. The tenderness scene at the fireplace while stranded in the
middle of nowhere has a refinement rarely seen these days where sex
scenes are used when there's nothing to say.

Shot at Lyon, and the city is referred at -mostly by Anne- about 8
