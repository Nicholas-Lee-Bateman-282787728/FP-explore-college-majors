2778103,5,B000NQRV80,"WARNING- CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS FOR THE SERIES

I've loved Fullmetal Alchemist from the start.  FMA is 51 episodes long, but doesn't waste a single one.  Each episode has a progression of the story.  Even if the episode doesn't feature the main characters (and I think there's only one or two that don't) it still uses the time to add depth to the other characters.  Each person has a distinct personality- and even characters we only see briefly, are so well fleshed that we feel empathy for them.  And, of course, the back story for the main characters, Ed and Al Elric, is amazing!  Throughout the story, the series refers back to their past.  We really get to see what makes them tick.  And they are truly human, not superheroes (at least in the anime sense).  Sure, Ed has mad skills with alchemy, but he is far from perfect.  He's also a good fighter, but can't beat his little brother... or his mechanic for that matter.... or his teacher.... and with Mustang, it was sort of a draw....

As for Al, he's just so sweet!  He has a real attachment to all things fuzzy, particularly kittens.  This is, perhaps, more heartbreaking considering his soul is trapped in a suit of armour- causing sensory deprevation.  Though upbeat for the most part, there are times when his happy facade cracks, and we are shown how deeply this state of being affects him.... and his older brother.

All in all, this is an anime I can easily place on the same greatness level as Cowboy Bebop, Ghost In the Shell, and Wolf's Rain.

2778104,5,B000NQRV80,"This show is great! It has the perfect combination of serious action driven plots, complex and heartfelt characterization, and super cute details.

The story of two brothers who live in a world where alchemy was developed instead of technology.  They learn the importance of following the law of equivalent trade where in order to gain something you must sacrifice something of equal value.

There is a beautiful philosophy in this story and lots of fun and interesting minor characters.  The story [...] in and I've been watching all the episodes.",1191456000,,548,5.055555555555555
2778105,5,B000NQRV80,"This is the only anime I've ever been able to get into. I watched others, but none of them ever got me excited. One day, my friend showed me the first episode of Fullmetal Alchemist. Something clicked. We stayed up all night watching other episodes. The story drew me in. It is well thought out and makes you care about the characters. Even my mom watched it! This will probably always be the only anime for me.",1191110400,,411,4.35064935064935

2778119,5,B000NQRV80,"Fullmetal Alchemist, in my opinion, is one of the best series out there.  The anime is funny, moving and engaging.  I would recommend this series to anyone and I have.  It's fantastic. Unfortunately I bought this before the Season 1 boxset came out, so it's a bit annoying.  For those considering this purchase, it seems to be a better value to buy the entire season boxset instead of part 1 and part 2 separately.  It does seem pricy but it's definitely worth the money.  Shop around for the best deals, this dvd should be in everyone's collection.",1258243200,,549,4.608247422680412
2778120,5,B000NQRV80,Too be honest FMA is probably is one of the best if not the best anime I've ever seen and I've quite a bit.  This anime has everything from great story and action scenes to great characters that have some of most amazing character development that I've ever seen.  I used to think the holy grail of anime was cowboy bebop (one of my all time favs) but after watching FMA im not so sure anymore.  Watch this anime you owe it to yourself,1236297600,,435,4.154761904761905
2778121,4,B000NQRV80,"This is a story of Alchemy and the consequences of using such power. Two brothers..Edward and Alphonse break the rules of Alchemy and try to bring back their dead mother. What they bring back is not their mother and it cost them more than they ever thought. Thus begins the story of the Fullmetal Alchemist and his brother who are trying to right a wrong and just get their lives back to normal.
 The story is 51 episodes and the movie ""The Conquerer of Shambala"". This series has so many characters and it does lag at times but it is necessary in order for character development. That is the only way you can understand the motives behind so many of those characters actions.
 This is something I have watched a few times..it has great replay value. It is one of my top 3 along with Trinity Blood & Death Note. I highly recommend this.
 The only draw back for me is that sometimes when they get hit in the head they have swirling lines where their eyes should be. I do not care for that type of anime and this has its share of that but not so much that it takes away from series.",1232755200,,1080,4.258536585365854
2778122,4,B000NQRV80,If you like Anime's I think this is a no brainer has a few filler episodes that you might thing don't belong their but overall it develops the story of many characters u like some you hate and some that are misunderstood. Dont pass on this series its worth watching at least one time through. By the way this is one of those weird shows that if you only watch one box set half of it won't make sense to you have to watch the whole thing and even then you will be left with questions,1232496000,,482,4.03125

2778125,5,B000NQRV80,Full Metal Alchemist is a great series to add to any collection! I have never owned a box set of any anime series before this one. I am so glad to have finally bought the box set. I know this is a anime series that will never grow old and that I want to watch again and again. What better way than to own the set?,1220572800,,313,3.757575757575758
2778136,5,B000NQRV80,"I have heard people call this the best anime of all time.  And its hard to say that it isn't. I loaned this to a friend at work and she said that at one point she broke down and wept.  This series is emotionally charged from start to finish.  All 52 episodes rock, not one fails to move the story forward.  I feel thank full  for having been able to watch it.  Do not miss this series.",1218758400,,385,3.935064935064935
2778137,4,B000NQRV80,"One of the best anime series to come along in recent years, Fullmetal Alchemist is an action-adventure series set in an alternate Earth, where alchemy rather than physics is the rule of the universe. Two young boys, both geniuses, try to bring their mother back from the dead, with horrific consequences that echo down the run of the series, and finally come full-circle in the final story arc. Engrossing, well-characterized storytelling.

Though I normally prefer the original Japanese voice actors to English dubs, the voice casting and directing on the English soundtrack is excellent.

Now for my nitpick, which has to do with how Funimation chose to package their DVDs. One of my pet peeves are previews/advertisements on DVDs that you cannot fast-forward through or skip. Funimation has put a long advertisement for Dragonball Z at the beginning of each and every disc in this boxed set, and you cannot fast-forward or skip it. Argh! It's extremely annoying.",1214697600,3,965,5.10126582278481
2778138,4,B000NQRV80,"Cool series.  Interestingly twisted theme.  just right mix of action, drama and violence.",1213142400,,89,5.769230769230769
2778139,5,B000NQRV80,"This series is great but strange, and the part when that little girl i forgot her name was combined with that dog that really had me that was sad and a little frightnig but this was great a nice work and great storyline. This is about two brother's that have a dad that's an alchemist, and then there mother always smiled at edward because he reminded her of there dad, then edward and elric's mother died so edward and elric went and got one of there dad's book to try to bring there mother back but an accident happend, edward lost one of his arm and leg and elric's soul got transported into a armor, edward saw something that was disgusting and that wasn't there mom. Edward was wondering were his brother went then when elric spoke edward was shocked and upset, elric took edward to that old lady's house to get help then edward recovered and then recived a metal arm and a metal leg. Edward's arm has alchemy that can make thing's appear like his sword, a wall, and make the ground colapse when targeting enemys and fix thing's, the use of edward's alchemy don't need a circle to summon his weapons' or to fixable use. His brother recived alchemy as well but he has to draw a circle in order to use his alchemy, edward he just put his hand's together and face them on the floor or the wall, and what ever he summon's will appear, that's cool. So this was a great series i saw all of this 1season know iam on season2 thats great to, this was a great series.",1210118400,,1462,4.300724637681159

2778141,5,B000NQRV80,"Fullmetal Alchemist is a very realistic story that tells how science can be used for wars and genocides and also to do cruel experiments on humans and animals. It also goes deep into how religions and science can crash into each other. In world of Edward and Alphonse Elric, the science of alchemy (a form of Chemistry) is advance. This advancement of science leads to human acting as a God to change the natural world and bring back humans from the dead. When the fine line between life and death, ...God and human is crossed bad things happens.",1206057600,,546,4.581632653061225

2778144,5,B000NQRV80,"What is the price of a human soul? What would you be prepared to pay to bring it back from the dead?

Using an art that balances on the Principle of Equivalent Exchange, two brothers attempt to bring back their mother, and lose themselves. This is the story of their journey to find themselves again.

Suitable for both children and adults, this story explores the relationships of the characters, as they struggle to gain back that which they have lost. Full of adventure, fast-paced action and deep emotion, it will keep you fascinated until the very end.

I recommend watching the subtitled version. The dubbed version subtly changes the character of the two boys, and their relationship with one another.",1202774400,,708,4.883333333333334
2778145,5,B000NQRV80,"Full Metal Alchemist is one special anime. Although I have a childhood affinity with Dragonball and its 300+ episode glory, stuff like that, orNaruto, just isn't what you want to see too much of in anime.

Not to mention they usually have terrible english dubs. Full Metal Alchemist (FMA) on the other hand, deserves its fanbase. The box itself is nicely designed including the inside booklets from each of the volumes before it's Boxed Release (I think but not first handedly sure). Sliding it out, I knew it was the right choice I bought this after having watched it before on another source. I think only the best can be watched, already and Then bought for principles sake. The foil on the inside sleeve of the box reflects that glistening in my eyes as I begin to watch this great series once again!

Well, it has memorable characters, mostly because of a lot of development in them from the first few episodes on. You can sympathise with Ed and Al, the two young brother protagonists of the series. Hopefully you rent put off by Ed's not so cool look, as he is, as referenced frequently as a joke in the anime ""pint sized"", his character and dark past make up for his non macho or pretty boy look. The sense of morality, brotherhood, questions on the world parallel to one similar to our own involving War and Religion are some of the passing topics of this series.

But this first box, creates the topics I listed, set up for the brothers and their allies to confront in the later boxes.

But most importantly, I need to tell you this. The English Dub, us Great!
It somehow makes Ed alot more mature and cooler than the japanese dub. And subtitles, you get the choice of the English Dubtitle, or English subtitle translation of the japanese voice acting. Which is nice to know the original meaning and dialogue as well as to get some of the japanese thinking or nominclature.

But the only problems I had is with the unskippable Advert at the start of each of the discs. Although, to be honest I saw some interest in the movies that I meant to have picked up on DVD. But Funimation should have made them skippable, like the Disney Ads CAN be skipped or we can use it to fill up the popcorn bowl or pour some drinks...

Cmon friends, fellow humans, Give FMA a watch. You'll like it. It's not all serious, there are laughs in between each serious event to lighten the load.",1202515200,,2378,4.480369515011548
2778147,5,B000NQRV80,"I thought the product was perfect.  The artwork added a lot to the set and just made you want to buy this amazing series.  It really is somehting that should not be missed.  I thought the extra features were great with the artwork gallery, textless songs, and commentary of select empisodes.  The experience of this DVD set is sublime and I so should never have watched it on TV.  I should just have waited for this amazing set to have come out!  I can't wait to order the two new box sets coming out in feb!  It is on my must see list!  I suggest buying this as soon as possible!",1201651200,,580,4.162162162162162
2778148,5,B000NQRV80,"Someone mentioned FMA was right up there with Ghost in Shell. I think not! FMA doesn't rely on half-naked women to draw its story of brotherly love and sacrifice.

2778151,5,B000NQRV80,"This is one of the greatest anime series of all time.... It is full of epic battles, light hearted laughs, dark idealisms, and innocent philosophies.  The series follows the exploits of the Elric brothers as they embark on a journey to find the fabled philosophers stone, an item so powerful that it is said to be capable of bypassing the laws of alchemy.  As their journey progresses they come across different life altering situations capable of molding their young minds into a darker distortion of their innocence.  From making friends with a young girl to seeing that young girl alchemically molded into a monstrosaty by her own father, the Elric brothers realize that they are living in a world as ugly and wretched as any nightmare that could have plagued their troubled minds.  The dvd box set includes episodes 1-16 for the hefty price of 39.99, you will also get a full episode of a pretty interesting anime which i will not reveal at this time, safe to say that i will probably look into that anime as well.  This series has everything an anime junkie could want, an engaging story line beginning to end, an amazing musical score, incredable battle sequences, and heartfealt drama all throughout, this is not one to miss.  For those collectors out there, the anime box looks great and you will also get 5 story sequences with the box set, not to mention the tons of extra features that already come with the dvd's.

I love this series, The episodes covered in this box set have some of the greatest moments in the entire series, especially episode 13 :) and the ever important episode 15 :(.....I do not recommend this series for anyone under 13 or 14 years old. There is alot of graphic violence, some swearing, plus anyone younger would never really understand all the underlying themes of the series regarding politics, corruption, war, love, devotion, and brotherhood.

There are the first four discs of the series with some small booklets exactly as though you were buying the discs separately.  However, these come with a rather nice slip-box.  There were no surprises here, which I'm fond of when buying something.

For people who are not familiar with the series, then it should be noted that Full Metal Alchemist is engrossing and an excellent shounen anime.  People who tend to enjoy such things would be well advised to buy the collections represented by these boxed sets.  Those who are just exploring the genre might be better suited buying simply the first disc singly in order to understand the feel of the show.",1193011200,14,737,4.674418604651163
2778155,5,B000NQRV80,"I've had mixed feelings about this series until I reached episode 22. Then I was certain that this was a keeper. Fullmetal Alchemist is a heart-wrenching, exciting action anime that struggles with the heart-wrenching issues of genocide and destruction.

The two main characters, Edward and Alphonse Elric, are seeking the Philosopher's Stone to bring back their missing body parts. They tried to ressurect their mother with the magic of alchemy, but instead, Alphonse lost his body and Edward lost an arm and a leg. And while their mother did come back from the dead, she definitely wasn't human.

Although this box covers the only the first 16 episodes, this is a decent starter set to pique people's interest in the series. The first episodes cover Ed and Al's journey to become state alchemists to gain access to alchemy books. Ed and Al also discover the liquid material responsible for making a philosopher's stone.

These aren't the most important episodes--those episodes were saved for the second part of season one. However, I can tell you that this is the best anime ever made--questioning whether the ends justify the means--whether people should sacrifice millions of lives for the things they desire.

Finally, I love this more than Evangelion, which is far more controversial for its ending, which drops the characters into really long existential speeches. I don't like to write about Evangelion--either people love it or they hate it. Fortunately, anyone can fall in love with this series, as long as they can bear with some bloody violence.",1192320000,3,1557,5.0703125

There are episodes that leave you at the edge of your seat, episodes that make you emotional, and episodes that are spine-tingling hilarious. As annoying as it gets, the music for this series is beautiful as all hell. Even if I can see it coming, I have absolutely no problem: Its always a welcome inevitability. My only small thing about it is that after watching Brotherhood, it is off-putting seeing characters acting differently, or whose motivation has been shifted. Otherwise its a great start to the series, critics have said it, anime fans (be casual or extreme) have praised it to varying degree.
