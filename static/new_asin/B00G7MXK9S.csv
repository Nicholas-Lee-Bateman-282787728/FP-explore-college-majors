6062740,2,B00G7MXK9S,"As a fly angler and tyer, I was looking forward to watching this. What a disappointment! Unlike Megan Boyd's salmon flies, this film was all fluff and very little substance.

While the animation was attractive and added another element to the story, there was way too much of it. It started to feel like filler in a movie that had very little to say.

No one knows for sure why a salmon takes a fly. Not sure the film maker knew why he was making this movie.",1404259200,,458,4.252873563218391
6062741,4,B00G7MXK9S,"If you don't like sex and violence as central themes this movie is for you. It's an ethereal story of a singular calling, salmon fly tying, in the Scottish countryside by a woman with a gift for tying flies that catch more salmon than anyone else's and are sought after by kings of England. We loved it because it's a real story about a real person with a unique insight.",1402790400,2,371,4.314285714285714
6062742,4,B00G7MXK9S,"Interesting story of one of the best salmon fly tyers in the world.  Interesting, and as good as advertised. Thanks",1395532800,,115,4.75
6062743,4,B00G7MXK9S,"For anyone who ties flies, this movie is a must.  There are parts of it that could have been better, I would have liked to have seen more flies and tying, but the movie creates a mood that seems to set off one's own creativity. Truly lovely.",1394755200,,241,4.127659574468085
6062744,2,B00G7MXK9S,This movie was rather slow moving with very little footage of the actual activity of fly tying which was an essential theme of the movie.,1393200000,,137,4.52
6062745,5,B00G7MXK9S,"Had seen a pre-release....very well done and romantic about FF and Megan's love for Fly tying. Pretty special to have viewed it
and why I own it now.",1391817600,,149,4.357142857142857
6062746,5,B00G7MXK9S,"I must say watching this film makes me wish for another place and time, and the chance to chase salmon with a fly.  This is a beautiful, magical examination of a unique life.  This woman who found artistic voice tying the most beautiful salmon flies imaginable connects us to another place and time.  This is a movie about the artistry and magic of fly tying, not about catching fish.  The images will stay with me.",1389657600,2,415,4.493333333333333
6062747,4,B00G7MXK9S,"A very interesting history of one of the oldest art forms and it's participants either directly or indirectly. If you are a fly fisherman, an artist or a history buff you should enjoy this film.",1389657600,,194,4.571428571428571
6062748,1,B00G7MXK9S,"Bought and paid for it.....easy peasy!....The cash shot out of my account like s*** off a shovel.

Then tried to download and watch it....not a chance.

""This operation is forbidden outside the USA""  I am in Belize. Nothing about this restriction on the SELL page!! Still have not seen it.

How come it is so simple to give Amazon money, but not so simple to get what you pay for?

Not even going to bother spending hours trying to get a refund... life is too short.",1389398400,,466,4.372093023255814
6062779,2,B00G7MXK9S,"I don't know if I was watching a documentary or an art school film project. Really tried to sit though this one but the constant animations and sappy music took me right out of the story and made me ask myself  ""okay what exactly does this have to do with Megan and tying flies?"". A dull and unappealing interpretation of an otherwise interesting story.",1435881600,,353,4.515625
6062780,3,B00G7MXK9S,"Overall the movie was alright, not what I expected. Was hoping for more footage of Megan Boyd and the animation break-in's became annoying after a while. The topic was a great idea, maybe someone with a fishing background would have been better suited to film/produce it.",1432166400,,271,4.913043478260869
6062781,5,B00G7MXK9S,Great for the serious salmon fly tier,1431043200,,37,4.428571428571429
6062782,5,B00G7MXK9S,"This an artful and inspiring presentation of the life of Megan Boyd, a master fly tyer of full-dressed salmon flies in Scotland.  It is pleasant and uplifting, of special interest to fly fishers in general, and salmon fishers in particular.  It will also be interesting to artists and students of folk arts and crafts in general, and the making of art films.",1430524800,,358,4.758064516129032
6062783,2,B00G7MXK9S,"There isn't much meat to this story, so the director fills huge voids with extended shots of scenery and animations.  In the end the viewer knows little more about Megan Boyd than that she was an enigmatic recluse who tied amazing flies.",1428451200,,237,4.642857142857143
6062784,5,B00G7MXK9S,"I received a copy of this from a friend in the UK, but it could only be played in the UK.  So I contacted Amazon and requested the proper zone to view it here.  Since we are salmon fishermen in our family, we loved this film and have shared it with several other avid anglers.  SBF",1426032000,,281,3.982142857142857

6062787,5,B00G7MXK9S,"A Lovely homage to Scottish fly tying and salmon fishing, first seen on Netflix while sampling random movie selections.  Beautifully illustrated and scored. Enjoyable even for non fly fishermen.  After watching this movie, I ordered it for my brother-in-law who ties flies himself.",1406073600,,281,5.511627906976744

8621273,3,B00G7MXK9S,"This film would be better with less irrelevant animation and more concentration on Megan, Salmon flydressing, and fishing. Too bad it was not done by people who were anglers and fly tiers.",1517875200,,188,4.90625

8621278,3,B00G7MXK9S,My husband loved it as he is an avid fly tyer and fisherman. I thought it was ok. I wish they had showed more of her flies.,1473811200,,123,3.5925925925925926

8621281,4,B00G7MXK9S,"With reviews touting Kiss The Water as being on par with A River Runs Through It and Rivers of a Lost Coast, I tucked into this film expecting to love it. Done documentary style somewhat like Rivers Of A Lost Coast, the film centers around a reclusive, somewhat eccentric woman (Megan Boyd) who lived in a sparsely-appointed cottage near a salmon river in northern Scotland and became one of the worlds most renowned tiers of salmon flies. This story might have been more powerful as a subtext to a film with a broader theme, such as the history and recent deterioration of wild salmon runs in Scotland (not to mention that many of the exotic birds used to tie these flies are also now in decline or extinct). The film touched on this, but less so than on Ms. Boyds relationship with Prince Charles, to whom she supplied flies. Many of the interviews were done with a single person sitting on a chair on an otherwise dark set. Personally, I wanted to see more of the river and countryside and more of the local villages. The truly compelling aspect of this film is the beautifully animated artwork that flows seamlessly with actual footage of rivers, countryside, people, fish and flies. The close-ups of Ms. Boyds flies, too, reveal a stunning artistry. Although not as substantive as some of the great angling films it has been compared with, Kiss the Water is undoubtedly the best fly-tying film ever made.",1448064000,3,1409,4.685483870967742
8621282,5,B00G7MXK9S,"You don't have to be a fly fisherman to appreciate Megan Boyd's artistry. And you don't have to be a filmmaker to appreciate Eric Steel's achievement, one of those rare things: a documentary that will not only inform you; it will lift you out of yourself and make you view the world differently afterward.",1437782400,,305,4.666666666666667
