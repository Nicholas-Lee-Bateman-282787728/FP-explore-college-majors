201818,5,1628624329,I have participated in small group studies using all previous Deeper Connection Series.  Technical aspects of the new videos are of higher quality and the camera angle draws the viewer to the presenter.  This current series continues to be Biblically-based and enhances one's knowledge of Jesus.  The emphasis on application personalizes each lesson and deepens one's faith.  The Last Days of Jesus has my highest recommendation.,1483660800,,429,5.454545454545454
201819,5,1628624329,"My Sunday bible study group is using the Deeper Connections study of the Miracles of Jesus. I am familiar with the series so I was eager to preview the Last Days of Jesus. The host Margaret Feinburg did a good job of setting up the sessions. I enjoy seeing the land of Israel, Caesarea Philippi, and the Kidron Valley and learning facts about the restoration of the Jewish cemetery. Jews buried face up with feet pointed toward Jerusalem. Varying filming sites makes the teaching more interesting.
Dr. Matt Williams teaching from Warrior to Servant is filmed at Vulture gold mine outside Phoenix, Arizona. His teaching of Peters rebuke and later presence on the Mount of Transfiguration offers all of us hope for forgiveness and helps us to realize our earthly wealth can be stolen at any moment. Dr. Mark Strause reporting from a horse ranch focuses on three important events: Triumphal Entrance- shows us fulfillment of prophecy and explanation of why Jesus arrived on a donkey; Cleansing of the temple: act of judgment on the temple and Israel prediction of destruction of the temple; Cursing of the fig tree symbolizes unfruitfulness of Israel. Application lessons are insightful.
Dr. Gary Burge s begins the study of the Resurrection by showing a beautiful mausoleum empty because the bones of this wealthy family was moved from this Chicago cemetery to one outside Wrigley field. The early church did not worship or make a shrine of the place where Jesus was buried because Christ defeated death. Last year I taught a 30 week bible study on the book of Matthew. I can testify that the information was accurate and interesting. Thank you Rose Publishing for this free material to review.",1482969600,2,1692,4.919580419580419
7800543,2,1628624329,"At least the first video was misleading. We were expecting a tour of Caesarea-Philippi and instead we got a guy in Arizona near an old mine trying to explain Matthew 16:13-18ff. The group I was with discussed his teaching afterward but only because we feel it was off based. Because of the first video, we didn't feel interested in watching any others.",1493424000,,352,4.693548387096774
7800544,5,1628624329,"""The Last Days of Jesus"" is a 6-session DVD Bible study for small groups or personal use. Each session is 25-35 minutes long. It starts with 2-3 minutes of video on location in Israel (Ceasarea Philippi, Mount of Olives, Garden Tomb, etc.) with Margaret Feinberg. This is followed by audio of the study text from Matthew using the NIV Audio Bible. Then a New Testament scholar provides 17 minutes of commentary on the passage and 6-10 minutes of application. They walk you through the text while explaining first century context and cultural background information.

For example, Session 1 covers ""Who do people say that I am?"" and explained why people thought Jesus might be those people and what they expected of the Messiah. Dr. Williams also explained some phrases like ""keys of the kingdom of heaven"" and underlying word plays. Each session features a different speaker, so Session 1 on Matthew 16:13-28 features Dr. Matt Williams, Session 3 on Matthew 21:1-22 features Dr. Mark Strauss, and Session 6 on Matthew 28:1-10 features Dr. Gary Burge.

The lessons are on Jesus the Messiah, the Transfiguration, the Triumphal Entry, the Last Supper, The Trial and Death of Jesus, and Jesus' Resurrection. Overall, I thought that the three sessions I viewed were informative and interesting. I'd recommend this series as a small group Bible study.

My review is based off of a free viewing of 3 video sessions as provided by the publisher.",1485216000,2,1437,4.979166666666667
7800545,5,1628624329,I'm happy to recommend this resource.  It sets quality biblical teaching in an inviting setting.  The talks are well-organized and rooted in the biblical text.  This would work well in a group Bible study setting; but will also be appreciated by individuals.,1484265600,,258,5.095238095238095
7800546,5,1628624329,"This is an articulate and in-depth Bible study that brings Scripture to life. The imagery displayed in the videos and the audible reading of Scripture enables the listener to place themselves in the scenario. Also, the presentation of differing interpretations encourages interaction with the application of Truth to the life of the Church. I greatly appreciate the explanation of the cultural and historical context to denote the tension between the Messiah of Jewish expectation and the suffering Messiah; it debunks false understandings of who Jesus is. Whether you've grown up in Church or are new believer, I definitely recommend this study. For those with an intellectual appetite, the use of Greek words creates a greater desire to be immersed in study of the text. For those who love the simplicity of the Gospel, you cannot help but be in awe of the love communicated in the last days of Jesus. For all Christians, a genuine intrigue in the Word of God in both the Old and New Testament.",1483920000,,996,4.934523809523809

The topics pull people in, and the great teachers keep viewers engaged.  It is such good source material, with a great host and a great voice reading the Bible passages. I value the professionalism and high quality, and that fact that the main teaching is done by some of the best experts in the field of New Testament and theology. What you get for the price is amazing.",1483920000,,490,4.632183908045977
7800549,5,1628624329,"In 30 years of ministry I've used many resources to educate and inspire people in the church.  After reviewing the various sessions of Last Days of Jesus I am very grateful for this well done resource!  This series provides a much needed balance of Bible teaching, background study and application.  It is an ideal resource for small groups as well as useful in adult Bible studies of all kinds. I especially look forward to using this as Easter season approaches!  Well done - I highly recommend!",1483747200,,497,4.744186046511628
7800550,5,1628624329,"The last days of Jesus leading up to his death are powerful. Jesus is serving and teaching right up until he becomes the ultimate sacrifice for our sins. Recognizing the full meaning and implications of these last days can be difficult on your own, but a study like this one helps these rich narratives come to life in new ways. It is amazing to be able to hear about the meaning of these accounts of Jesus' last days from scholars who have studied these texts closely so that they can be faithful teachers. This DVD series would be so helpful for personal use as you seek to gain a further understanding of what is happening in the last days of Christ or for use with a church small group. The teaching of these incredible scholars coupled with stirring scenes filmed in Israel makes for a great DVD study of the last days of Christ.",1483747200,,834,4.422077922077922
7800551,5,1628624329,"This series contains excellent Bible teachers who take deep Biblical truths and present them in very accessible ways. From always beginning with an introduction in Israel itself, to then explaining the background context for each passage, you get an awesome backdrop for the teachings that follow. This is good scholarship and professionally presented so that it is not boring or cheesy. Listeners quickly will see the Messianic identity and significance of Jesus, and how they are to respond.",1483747200,,493,5.333333333333333
7800552,5,1628624329,"From the intellectual insights to the intimate ""Jesus moments"" coupled with life-changing reflections, this series has many layers of excellence! As a pastor of 20 years, I used this with our small groups and we came away profoundly impacted and deeply impressed. The video production on these is also very well done and worth noting.",1483660800,,334,5.090909090909091
