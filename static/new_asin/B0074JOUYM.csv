8510063,5,B0074JOUYM,"Good movie, great music, love Susanna Hoffs,",1497657600,,44,5.428571428571429
8510064,5,B0074JOUYM,Great footage of the City of Chicago back in the late 70s Good music and some of Chicago's best musicians in the 70s.,1478649600,,117,4.130434782608695
8510065,5,B0074JOUYM,"Great film, outstanding music, beautiful shots of Chicago.",1441497600,,58,6.375
8510066,3,B0074JOUYM,"A great visual postcard of 70's Chicago. Forget the throwaway lets-put-together-a-band film concept and just enjoy the simple, yet formulaic story with some pretty good R&B music.",1435104000,,179,5.666666666666667
8510067,5,B0074JOUYM,"One of the best music films ever made. It was made in 1978 and just came out on DVD. Check out ""The Making of Stoney Island"" on You tube.",1372636800,,137,3.7586206896551726
8510068,3,B0074JOUYM,"This is a fun film for me because I know some of the people in this film. But in technical terms, it's in widescreen, but contrary to the info on the back of the box, the sound mix is 2.0 mono and stereo, not 5.1 as advertised.",1365033600,,227,3.851063829787234
8510069,4,B0074JOUYM,"This is THE film for those who love authentic soul music with the atmosphere to fit the feelings. Ronnie Barron, makes the film; entering about mid-way through.",1343433600,,160,4.962962962962963
8510070,3,B0074JOUYM,"This is a good movie if your a Susanna Hoffs fan, and like movies about the real life grind trying to make it in the music world. Little did they know then, but 12 years later one of the actors would become the founding member of one of the most popular and greatest rock bands of the 1980s the Bangles.",1341619200,,303,4.066666666666666
8510071,5,B0074JOUYM,"Nice movie about musicians and singers trying to make it.  I liked this well enough to recommend it to anyone who has doubts.  It will have an appeal even if you don't come from Chicago but if you are from Chicago like I am then there is significance galore.  I didn't originally watch this using my home theater but will do so soon to really get a feel for the music.  As for the movie, if there is any cussing I can't remember it and I don't remember seeing any nudity.  It's a pretty clean movie that moves right along",1338422400,4,521,4.17
