8735619,5,B01648P646,"I own just about everything Jacques Ppin ever wrote -- he is a master of technique; he is my idol.  In one episode, I was watching him slice something and I thought - that knife is dull - and in the next instant, he picked up a steel and honed the blade, before continuing.  It's great to learn and practice good technique, and be able to spot problems both in your own, as well as in other people's performance..",1522195200,,413,4.215189873417722
