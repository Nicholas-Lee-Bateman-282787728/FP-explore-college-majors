8297787,1,B001ED3JHS,"I should have loved this movie.  Alan Hale, Sr. is a favorite actor and I love this genre.  However, the audio was so poor, I couldn't understand the dialogue. The video just as poor, it appears out of focus and grainy. The plot was all over the place.  I have no idea why Alan Hale starred in such a poor film. Maybe he had a boat payment due?  I have no idea why other reviewers like this movie. Maybe they got paid to review it? I don't know.

I feel swindled and lied too. You can't run away from this movie fast enough!!",1381795200,,525,4.058252427184466
8297788,4,B001ED3JHS,"I may be a tad confused on the date on this film some locations say it was 1939 others 1931 the front of the film however has ""copyright MCMXXXIX - PASSED BY THE NATIONA BOARD OF REVIEW""

Again there are many confusing descriptions of this film. Not just different views. Too many people rushed to review without actually viewing the movie and compounded the misconception of this film.

We start out with a forward that explains the film best. It covers the use of U-Boats in general and shows authentic exploits of the U 67 which actually take place before our story begins.

U.S. Navy skipper Greg Winters (Alan Hale) is dismissed from the service for hesitating in the attack to instead pick up victoms of a torpedo strike. Later through a set of coincidence he meets up with his nemesis, the U-Boat captain that got away. Now before you thing this is a straight out revenge story think twice as the story get convoluted and is hard to tell the good, from the bad, and from the ugly.
