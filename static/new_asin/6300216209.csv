247607,4,6300216209,"It's a good story with clever, funny dialogue and very good camera work. There is something really magical about old fashioned film at an old fashioned frame rate. What I really like about it is that it's from 1970, and many things that were normal back then are strange to my eyes, having grown up in a different time. I don't just mean that the cars and clothes are different, or that there are no cell phones such that it's difficult to reach people immediately. There are certain assumptions about gender back then that are different now and it adds to the interest in the film in that it gives us a time machine to view a segment of 1970 American culture. I think this movie was worth my time.",1517702400,,698,4.376923076923077
247608,4,6300216209,"I think this film was nicely made. The script seemed to try-too-hard on making Ali MacGraw a smart/loner. The acting seemed like a high school play, but when you push though the acting and script, it's a good movie to watch.
The over-use of 'Preppie."" was slightly annoying, I'll admit. I liked that there wasn't a sex scene or naked people. The profane language spoken seems minuscule to today's.
If you are reading the comments to reach a decision (Should I or Should I Not?) you Should. I'm glad I took a chance :)

SPOILER - As being a person (Tim's girlfriend) with a similar diagnosis, I found this relaxed - I didn't cry or mumble ""Oh no's"".",1517270400,,648,4.491525423728813

247705,3,6300216209,"A great movie for about 6 months after it came out, and since that time, so very, very dated. A multitude of cliches all rolled into one.  The rich guy, the poor girl, the different classes, the different religions, the star crossed romance, the joy, and then suddenly kissed by cruel death.

The early 70's when this film came out largely saw the end of college students marrying upon graduation. It happened for a number of economic and social reasons.
College graduates started marrying in their mid to late 20's, even early 30's, after establishing a career.
Several other things in this film would have been unbelievable or laughable, even 10 years later.",1513036800,,660,4.831858407079646

248076,4,6300216209,"Dated but you might like that feature.  It speaks to a moment in history.  Look at it like a way to learn cultural history.  Both good actors so they pull off the love story chemistry.  Most people I know who went to Harvard are snobs who think they belong to a club that makes them smart, when they are really lazy and in professional places do not do their share of the work.  But since the Ali MacGraw character is from a poor family, and Ryan O'Neil's character is from a rich family but he's not taking any crap from his rich father, I don't mind the Harvard reference.  Maybe it really once was a place like that.  It's a fantasy about the sixties counterculture.
Ryan O'Neil's father does not want his son to marry a girl from a working class family, and he says to his son ""If you marry that girl, I won't give you the time of day.""
Ryan O'Neil responds ""Father, you don't know the time of day.""
One might wonder, what does this father have against her.  Is this some kind of aristocracy thing?  But he is a good villain, fighting for prestige and against love.  In that sense, it's like a Jane Austin novel thematically.  I'm not saying that it's as good as Jane Austin.  It's still good and captures a moment in history.
The sixties has been criticized as been a rich college kid movement that pretended to be about power to the people.  That is probably a valid criticism, but heck, it's a movie.  Enjoy it.  And the sixties was about something, civil rights, ending the war in Vietnam and realizing that we can talk against the war and still be patriotic.  Love not guns.  Give peace a chance.

Ali MacGraw is sexy and sweet at the same time.  Check her out in Goodbye Columbus.",1470960000,,1712,4.360759493670886

That's supposed to be the biggest emotional part of the story because you were meant to feel endeared towards her character, but it failed miserably. And the tagline they repeat over and over, ""Love means never having to say your sorry"". I think they built a movie over seeing that on a bumper sticker. It's a completely misguided statement first of all. And it's used as an excuse for the lead character to continue being a stubborn spoiled moron and not resolve any issues in his life.",1465948800,3,767,4.605839416058394

Plus, that silly piano score of ""Where Do I Begin"" that keeps popping up throughout the movie like some nauseating mantra! Eeeuueeww! Yeah, they LOOK cute together, but in real life, these two would never have been a couple. No one speaks like this or acts this way in college. Totally unbelievable. And how does a confirmed non-believer in God go around damming His name SO much in this movie? Ali McGraw swear's God's name every time she speaks; I mean EVERY time! It's so utterly ridiculous and laughable you can play a drinking game with it! Yeah, great writing there, Segal!

248898,5,6300216209,"***** This review contains spoilers. Love Story (1970) stars Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal as a free-spirited couple that goes through trials and tribulations (Oliver's poor relationship with his demanding father, and Jennifer's fatal illness), but their love for each other is eternal. While watching this movie, I could just feel the intensity of each scene, as if it's so real, rather than the sometimes unrealistic love that is found in some Hollywood movies. Ali MacGraw gives the performance of a lifetime as a sharp-tongued vivacious and very comical young woman, and carries this throughout the whole film, as if nothing can crush her spirit. This movie has a tragic ending, which makes the average person want a happy ending (due to the loveability of Jennifer), but if that somehow happened, this movie wouldn't be half the movie it is. In a sense, we the audience have to get on board when it comes to the sad ending and endure the frustration if we are to appreciate what a true love story is really about. Casting MacGraw was the perfect choice, as well as O'Neal; they seem to have the perfect chemistry on screen. The prevailing message of ""love means never having to say you're sorry"" is very powerful here, and used perfectly. The special features are good, too. Love Story is one of the greatest movies of all time, and certainly in my top 10.",1439510400,3,1359,4.762711864406779

My husband and I feel that Al Gore is so full of himself and sure that he is a glorified human being and that we should thank God for his presence here on Earth. Well, he is VERY much mistaken for THAT thought. I am sorry to all those Al Gore fans but that is how some of us feel about him. I found out this bit of information on IMDB but other than that, the movie is great for the times when we feel our love life has gone awry. I watch it every now and then when I am in the mood. The line especially ""Love means never having to say you are sorry"" is reinforced in the movie, ""What's up Doc?"" with Barbara Streisand and Ryan O'Neil as meaning how really stupid that line is. But of course, in this movie, it is the focal point of the whole plot. Have fun watching it, and don't be surprised if you still shed a tear or two.",1429401600,,953,3.9123711340206184

249251,3,6300216209,"I agree with the good reviews as well as the bad reviews.  It's sort of bad, but it gets away with being bad, so that makes it good.

Ali's dark brown eyes bring emotion and sadness to her role. When she was reading the poem at the wedding ceremony she could have been in the 18th or 19th century.  Ali sometimes sounded like she was delivering her lines at a table read, but somehow it still worked.

Didn't like the coldness that Ryan's character aimed at Ray Milland.  I had to keep reminding myself that he was Ray Milland, so I shouldn't worry too much about it.

Ryan delivered. He managed to take what could have been quite corny, and give it some credibility.

Ali's wardrobe reminds me of my own at the time. The short plaid skirts with tights takes me back to that era.

Nice New England feel to it.  Overall, not a bad movie, overall not a good movie. What can I say?",1428192000,,878,4.240963855421687

249535,5,6300216209,"This is an old movie, so, of course, it is ""dated.""  But it is also ""timeless.""  It is a very sweet and sad story.  We know from the very first sentence of the movie that Jenny has died. Then we see their love story. They get married and later see a doctor because they cannot understand why they haven't been able to get pregnant. The doctor's tests show that Jenny is ""very sick,"" and although it is never actually said, it is understood that she has leukemia.

The only parts that I did not like - which makes the story very dated which could never happen today --was that the doctor told the husband that ""Jenny is very sick,"" but he did not tell Jenny - today, a doctor would never give a diagnosis (of any kind, especially a serious one) to the husband but not to the patient herself - the doctor would never tell the husband anything at all without the patient's permission. This movie is also famous for the line, ""Love is never having to say you're sorry,"" which is also dated, because when you are wrong or when you have hurt someone, saying that you are sorry is extremely important and necessary.

249737,5,6300216209,"Never a dull moment in this wonderful movie!

This truly is a masterpiece! Definitely NOT just a typical run of the mill romance movie, but highly dramatic and beautiful!

Andy Williams' song, ""Love Story,"" plays throughout this movie as the theme song, but in different tones if you will. It's the same song, but is played differently throughout to express distinct moments in the movie! Very creative & clever how the song itself, which is also the namesake of the movie prominently plays throughout this awe-inspiring film!

The setting is Harvard University. Two young Harvard undergrads from two different worlds fall madly in love, he's comes from a wealthy, old monied family, and a is hockey jock, and she comes from a poor working background, whose father iowns a bakery in Cranston, Rhode Island. Despite their financial differences, they find common ground between the two of them all the while trading wise cracks at each other's expense,  then they get married, and devastation takes place...

To find out more about this beautiful and awe-inspiring movie that will leave you speechless and teary-eyed @ the same time, I highly recommend you buy it today!

I don't think you will be disappointed!

The ONLY thing I didn't like in this movie was the profanity, but aside from a few choice words, it's without a doubt, one of the best movies in modern times I've ever seen hands down!",1402790400,,1395,4.885593220338983

I found the script, the college campus scenery, the personalities of the characters, as well as their statureand acting to be totally interesting.  Of course, as many who are familiar with the story are aware, this is the story of two students who attend attend ""ivy league"" schools- Harvard and Radcliffe.  The meet, fall in love, and ultimately marry after graduating.  Aly Mcgraw, the Radcliffe student, ultimately works and earns the tuition needed to put Ryan O'Neil- the Harvard student, through law school.  The story is told in a serious, poignant fashion- the seriousness of these two, their love for each other and their desire to ""make it"" in life is told in a straight forward interesting fashion. The scenery of New York, Boston, and the college campuses are beautiful.  Without relating the actual occurences of the last 30 minutes of the movie, I will say that they are awesome.

It was the first movie that made me cry. Funny, I watched it about a week ago and I still cry! This film was criticized by some at the time, but it is one that has staying power. At least for me. If you loved it the first time around, chances are you will love it for subsequent viewing. It is one of my favorite movies, and allows me to go back to a time filled with happy memories. I think the difference in this movie and some others is the fact that the characters are believable, and you really do get the sense that they  love each other in spite of odds against them.

I've listened to the Bach piano piece more times than I can count. as a middle age woman much more aware of misogyny in the world I'm not fond of the b*tch word the Ryan O'Neal character called the Ali character cause I feel the filmmakers could've shown their story was ""hip"" without resorting to female name-calling. I'd rate it a 3 nowadays. Upon recent re-viewing, still cared about the characters and felt very sad when the Ali MacGraw character dies. Great movie music theme.",1385942400,,675,4.540983606557377

Many people call this a tearjerker, but to me it almost gave off a heartfelt and warm feeling. Watch for yourself and see what you get out of it.

But this is a simple story that really relies  upon great chemistry between the leads to make it soar , and  that's not here. They seem wooden and uncomfortable with each other much of the time. Compare their scenes of intimacy with , say Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor, who also play doomed young lovers  in A Place In the Sun... Different movie, different era ( well only 19 years apart really)  but you  can see the difference in  emotional heft when  the chemistry between two actors  is there -when they seem really into each other and not just saying lines.

I'd never seen Love Story  in its entirety before but I'm glad I did. I can see why it may have been a huge hit in it's time, but it hasn't aged particularly well and it could probably benefit from a remake... Liam Hemsworth and Jennifer Lawrence maybe?",1361404800,,923,4.506024096385542

250152,4,6300216209,"I saw this film theatrically -when it was first released- being me a teenager; I must acknowledge that the movie was big at the time and it impressed me enormously.

This is a film that has aged very well in part for the way it was carried out (Lot of filming on location, normal lightning, no-makeup makeup, natural acting) and for the fact that is a straightforward-simple story well told. This is a case in which the sum of the parts is much better that the individual ingredients. Part of the success relies on the shoulders of both protagonists (Ali McGraw and Ryan O'Neal in their prime) who had a wonderful chemistry together, and director Hill who delivers a frank no-sense direction. Perhaps the only thing that has not aged so well is -ironically- the immensely famous Oscar-winning musical score (I always felt that it was a little bit at odds with the style of the movie); nevertheless it has its moments (Like the one when Oliver looks for the missing Jenny) that are still powerful and involving.

The Bluray looks OK (I still remember that the stock in which the film was made did not looked that well in the Cinema), and the upgraded-from-mono 5.1 DTS-Master HD audio sounds merely proficient. The delivery by Amazon was excellent and swift.",1353369600,5,1257,4.709090909090909

250189,5,6300216209,"I read Love Story (Segal, 1970) the first time after watching the movie in the summer of 1970.  I have read this book various times throughout my lifetime.  The story has been called a modern version of Romeo and Juliet, but it goes deeper than that.  The plot of the story addresses social differences in the American society, family pressure, and expectations.  The characters are very unconventional and the story structure is not traditional.  These characteristics make the story interesting and touching.
The characters and the plot interweave.  The characters come from opposite ends of the social spectrum. Oliver Barrett IV comes from high society and from a very wealthy family whose members are Harvard alumnae.  The family even donated the Barrett Hall to the University. Jennifer Cavilleri comes from a collar worker family; her father owes a small bakery.  Oliver's family is from Ipswich, Massachusetts and Jennifer's family is from Cranston, Rhode Island.  Jennifer attends Radcliff College under a scholarship. Oliver attends Harvard.  When they meet their attraction is strong and mutual (p. 2).  Their friendship develops and they fall in love. Oliver's family is very competitive and expects him to go to Law School, take over the family business, and marry someone in their same social level.  His father is a banker, landlord, and business owner.  Jennifer's father just wants his daughter to be happy.  He does not pressure his daughter at all.  She has no mother since she died when Jennifer was a child.  Their social gap becomes evident when they visit each other's home.  Oliver's parents are cold toward their own son and they treat Jennifer cordial but cold.  Jennifer's father is a down-to-earth niece guy.  Oliver's home is a huge state. Jennifer's home is a humble working class adobe in a row of street houses, with no extra land.  Their difference in social status could not be any larger.  Their love is stronger than Oliver's parents' prejudice.  Jennifer receives a scholarship to study music in Paris, France and Oliver proposes.  They marry.  Oliver is disinherited by his father for marrying Jennifer and by doing so, defying his father.
It is interesting how the first sentence of the book opens with the climax of the story, in the form of a question: What can you say about a twenty-five-year-old-girl who died?"" (p. 1).  Even though the climax is given out on the first sentence of the book, a complete unconventional approach to traditional story structure, this ""preview"" that might have been considered a spoiler made the reader's curiosity grow.  The readers want to find out how and why this young life extinguishes. The whole story is a flashback that takes us to the day these two young lovers meet in Radcliff College Library.  The story moves through defined chapters and takes us through their courtship, marriage, Oliver's Law School, working summers in Massachusetts shore, Oliver's graduation from Law School, Oliver's law firm job, and their big move to New York City.  Toward the end of the story Jennifer is diagnosed with leukemia and that is the reason why she can't conceive.  Oliver is devastated and ridden with guilt.  Oliver buys airline tickets for Paris, but Jennifer states that is not the way they are going to approach her disease and her final days.
This book was a success by the way the plot addressed social issues that were not openly discussed and were not well known by the general public, unless the reader belonged to the high class society.  The story addresses love and sacrifice. It also shows how family expectations and demands are prioritized over parents love and support for their child.  The characters idiosyncrasy and upbringing plus the story development and structure make a touching and fascinating book.",1344729600,,3799,5.038461538461538

250191,2,6300216209,"When I was a boy, the film that dominated my earliest memories of pop culture was 1970's Love Story. From the music to the saying, `Love means never having to say you're sorry,' to Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal being everywhere, it was the biggest movie of its day; sort of what Titanic was to folks a decade ago. And, yes, like Titanic, it's a schlocky film. It has a few saving graces which place it above the doomed ocean liner picture, though. One, there's no Leonardo DiCaprio in the film. Yes, Ali MacGraw was a terribly wooden actress. Her wooden performance here is mind-numbing. But, it's still not as earnestly bad as DiCaprio's. Second, despite the title being meant to refer to the film's two leads, Oliver and Jenny, played by O'Neal and MacGraw, the far more interesting love story is that played out between father and son. O'Neal plays Oliver Barrett IV, while Ray Milland plays his father, Oliver Barrett III. And, it is this relationship, between WASP scion and patriarch, that is so good that it carries the otherwise predictable soap opera of a film over the threshold to passability as a film. Is it a great film? No way, but Ray Milland does give a great performance as the emotionally impotent father.

  The film was directed by Arthur Hiller, a serviceable Hollywood journeyman, and adapted from the bestselling novel of the same name, by Erich Segal. I used to get Segal and the book Jonathan Livingston Seagull, by Richard Bach, mixed up all the time, because of the Segal/Seagull and Erich/Bach `ch' connections. Also, both films come from the dippy-doo era of American literature. Anyone who is in their mid-forties or older will know the tale, but for the young'uns, a brief recap. Young Oliver meets Jenny Cavellari on campus, at Harvard. She goes to Radcliffe. They have a series of very fast paced scenes that are ill-wrought dialogue-wise. Nonetheless, much happens in the first twenty to thirty minutes, and, in this way, Love Story was a precursor to the MTV-like editing style that has gripped film for the last twenty or so years. But, technically, the film is quite good. Its use of montage, superimposition, scoring (although, at two or three times the theme song intrudes too loudly), editing, and giving snippets of a scene and letting the viewer fill in the rest, works, and credit should go to Hiller for giving his cinematographer, Dick Kratina, room to experiment. In modern films, this utilitarian concision does not happen. A film is cut quickly, but the viewer has no way of filling in the action, so you get a sort of narrative strobing, whereas in this film, the cuts work because the setups so strongly reinforce what will happen, which is confirmed no less than a scene or two later.

 A final point, though. For a tearjerker, I was left dry. Love Story is schlock, pure and simple, but well made schlock. Cum-see, cum-sa.",1339027200,3,2873,4.761044176706827

250194,4,6300216209,"Despite the fact that I'm happily married to my high school sweetheart, I usually despise romance stories.  I find most to be over-the-top sugary sweet, gag-worthy and unconvincing.

I actually looked this movie up because I love the theme song.  When I was a child, I had a music box that played the song and had always wanted to see the movie from where the song originated.

I delayed watching the movie until one day I must have had some some sort of surge of estrogen.  I put on a facial mask, took a bubble bath, applied henna to my hair, painted my nails, and ordered this movie to watch while the henna soaked in my hair.  (I'm an adult former tomboy.  I don't usually do this sort of thing.)

My hubby and oldest daughter watched the movie with me.  We all really enjoyed it.  Parts of it were syrupy sweet - but even so, the couple's love for one another was believable.  It seems like so many movie couples are only infatuated with one another, so it was nice to see a couple that was really truly in love.  I didn't find their devotion to one another out of the ordinary.  It wasn't a story where a beautiful woman conned some man into falling for her and then living happily ever after.  They worked hard together and made sacrifices to reach their goals.  Even if the movie didn't end in the way it did, I think that a couple like these characters would have happily reached their 50th wedding anniversary together.  (It's a romance movie though.  I guess it is more interesting for it to have a tear-jerking tragic ending.)

It is a 70's movie, so it isn't going to be as flashy as modern movies.  Some of the dialog is corny.  Even so, I think it's worth watching at least once.",1331164800,,1694,4.3514376996805115
250195,5,6300216209,"Coming in at #9 on the American Film Institute's ""Most Famous Romantic Films of All-Time"", ""Love Story"" catapulted Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw to fame and is highly regared by many as being one of the best films ever.

 After starring on television's ""Peyton Place"" for its entire five year run in the sixties Ryan O'Neal became a box office sensation after starring in ""Love Story"", a rare feat for most actors who have solid careers in TV as many can't make the switch to a successful movie career. In ""Love Story"" O'Neal plays Oliver, a college student who falls in love with the beautiful Jennifer. After Oliver's father cuts him off personally and professionally when he decides to marry Jennifer the two embark on surviving alone in a cold and sometimes heartless world. The ending of this movie is a must-see event as this love story comes to a tragic conclusion.

 On a $2.2 million budget ""Love Story"" became one of the most successful romantic movies ever grossing a remarkable $106.4 million and making Ryan O'Neal a much in demand Hollywood leading man.",1324512000,3,1064,4.766304347826087

But for some reason everything just clicks in this charming tearjerker. It may be the great on screen chemistry between O'Neal and McGraw, it may be the clever dialogue, or the New England backdrop. The end result is that it is simply irresistible. I've watched it dozens of times without ever growing tired of seeing it.",1321920000,5,591,4.5327102803738315
250198,2,6300216209,"Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw invented the chick flick with this 1970 film adaptation of Erich Segal's syrupy novel of the same name. It's hard to rate LOVE STORY. Everything you can say about it is true: It tugs at the heartstrings, it epitomizes young love, it's emotional and it's moving; it's also maudlin, contrived, mechanical and false. Whether this is a Best Picture nominee or a low-budget pile of tripe really depends entirely on your mood. The cloying sweetness of the brief, poignant relationship between Oliver Barrett IV and Jenny Cavilleri is melded together with pathos---nay, bathos---in a mixture that will bring tears to your eyes, either from sorrow or stunned hilarity. Again, it's all dependent on your mood.

Jenny is a Radcliffe girl, yes, but she got to Radcliffe and then Harvard by dint of intelligence and perseverance. Her father owns a bakery in New York. Oliver is a Harvard Legacy boy, whose remoter ancestors came over on the Mayflower and whose more recent ancestors owned the factories that Jenny's forebears probably worked in. They meet and fall deeply, ineradicably in love.

Oliver is preternaturally embarrassed by his family's wealth and status. He has distanced himself from his father (whom he calls ""Sir"" throughout the film, except for once), played by Ray Milland as Oliver Barrett III. ""Sir"" is not a warm father, but he seems more clumsy than venial in attempting to smooth Oliver's way through life. ""Sir"" can fix everything with a phone call, and he is dumbfounded by Oliver's refusal to allow him to intercede in getting him into Harvard Law School, getting him a job with the ""right"" Firm, funding his lifestyle, and advising him on his marriage. All in all, however, ""Sir"" remains distant but gracious toward his son and daughter-in-law. Oliver is surprisingly boorish toward him.

Jenny and Oliver's idyll comes to an abrupt end when she is diagnosed with Leukemia, a certain killer in 1970. The constant grayness of the winter scenes effectively foreshadow the death that defines this film.

Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw are both impossibly young in LOVE STORY. The chemistry between them is palpable and adds to the film's effect (O'Neal once said that he has loved only two women in his life, Farrah Fawcett and Ali MacGraw). MacGraw's scenes with O'Neal sparkle, though her acting is otherwise wooden and her toneless recitation of some of the dialogue is so jarring as to be disturbing. Given the time and place, I had to wonder what, if anything, she was using recreationally.

LOVE STORY either descends or ascends into hell or heaven at this point, becoming the tear-jerker nonpareil of all time. As Jenny becomes more ill she becomes even more loving and more beautiful; she's apparently suffering from a cosmetic blood disorder, an overabundance of the Max Factor.

LOVE STORY's tag line, ""Love means never having to say you're sorry,"" warped a generation of young women for whom the flawed, human flesh-and-blood men they met could not, ever, pass the Oliver Test. The unmeetable romantic expectations of LOVE STORY probably fueled the divorce rate and filled out the ranks of single adults in the Me Decade. Of course, love means being entirely able to say you're sorry when the occasion demands; unless your partner loves you so uncritically that apologies never enter into your relationship, as they don't in this film; but, of course, it is only a film. Forty years on, today's jaded audience most likely will never forget that.",1320451200,7,3494,4.9743150684931505

As I watched the movie, the following passages from the Bible came to mind:

Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger by the way you treat them. (Ephesians 6:4a)

The fool says in his heart, ""There is no God."" (Psalm 14:1)

And he told them a parable, saying, ""The land of a rich man produced plentifully,  and he thought to himself, 'What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?'  And he said, 'I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.  And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.'  But God said to him, 'Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?'  So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God.""

250306,3,6300216209,"This film is sad.
This film is arrogant.
This film is simple.
This film is edited poorly.
This film means never having to say you're sorry.

These are just a few random thoughts conjured up while recently watching the 1970s blockbuster hit, ""Love Story"".  It is the summer of blockbusters, and while $10 or more is a bit like paying for gas at the local Cineplex, this critic decided to watch old blockbusters in the comfort of his cool, quiet, and subdued home.  Having read the book many years ago, I was eager to see how exactly it would translate onto the bigger screen.  There was little action, little conflict, and even a smaller plot - it was, simply put, a ""love story"".  Two Ivy-leaguers meet, they argue with their parents, they marry, and suddenly tragedy strikes.  It is simple, like love - and it does translate well onto the screen with our two leads being Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw.  Together their chemistry is shattering, bring to life a small piece of Americana, and the depth of life.  As Jennifer and Oliver pour their literal hearts out on screen, the issues of ""Love Story"", while not many, do break free and run rampant throughout.  The lacking development, the clutter of language, the electric music, and the cheapened edits all culminate as utter distracts to this film.  These errors pull from the story, creating a mediocre tale that could have been the greatest love story ever sold.

Let me begin by saying that as much criticism as I give ""Love Story"", it still (and probably will with another viewing) brought a tear to my eye.  It is ultimately a story about the power of love, and even if you can see through the clich language, parts of this film will remind you of a love you have or once had.  It has sentimental value that presses on the right heartstrings at the right time.  We can thank, and denounce at the same time, writer Erich Segal for this.  His story takes us to love, but his words violently pull us away.  Throughout this film, one cannot help but wonder if O'Neal and MacGraw read their lines off cue-cards behind them, or if the words coming from their mouths were to be staples of clich for decades of romantic films to follow.  In one corner we have a witty, independent woman who is not afraid to speak her mind, in the other corner, we have a guy who takes direction well - OK - I get that, but what else is there about these characters that we could learn about.  If this is to be a talking film, let the words they speak to each other express their emotion stronger - or at least develop a subplot around them that allows the viewer to see all the dimensions of both Oliver and Jennifer.  I knew their connections, but I finished this film without really knowing them.  From the book, one could hear their inner-voice, without that in the film, we were lead on a one-sided voyage through love without any potholes or pitfalls.  Each and every time a conflict occurred, simple words were spoken, we were taken to a new city, and we began our story all over again.  With conflict comes resolution, and one cannot resolve with just one phrase - ""Love means not having to say your sorry"".

Clarification.  The simplicity of this story is what kept me glued to the screen the entire hour and a half.  The acting force behind O'Neal and MacGraw was consistent throughout, providing me with excited moments, emotional moments, and a heavy cardboard aftertaste.  While their characters were enjoyable to watch, they lacked the depth needed to really pull further at my heartstrings.  I knew what sort of characters they were, but they needed to take one more step to fully make me believe they were who they were pretending to be.  Earlier I used the word arrogant when describing this film through free association.  I use this word because I believe writer Segal and director Hiller knew what they had for audiences by the end of their film, they knew that if they kept these two one-dimensional characters together long enough; they would have the audiences coming back by the third act.  To me, this ploy seemed arrogant of them.  Give us more, give us characters, give us at least impressive scenery - but instead we were handed one phrase and tears.  Not enough.

Not complaining, but the music could have benefited from either a dedicated theme song or a better composer, the strum of the piano chords never quite hit that level of emotion I needed to bawl my eyes out.  The music was potent at first, but by the second act, it felt stale of overplayed.  It wasn't the theme music of Oliver and Jennifer's love that could have further strengthened their relationship.  Coupled with elaborately bad edits, our film stands solely on the doorstep of the actors.  They are good, not quite great, but worth viewing merely for those small moments of joy where you feel like you are watching a film, not being a sinister voyeur on their lives.  ""Love Story"" is a sad love story, alas, it needed something more - a stronger element that would have shown Oliver's hatred for his father, his dedication to his life, and his ability to discover love anywhere in life.  One needed a few more chapters of the book translated to the screen to make these characters full bodied enough to bring that climactic ending to a stand still.  Instead, Hiller's direction just made it feel like an opus of clichs.

Overall, ""Love Story"" was worth the singular view, but repeat viewings will not be needed.  The choice of casting Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw was superb, these were two people that could carry the weight of this world on their shoulders, but Hiller never gave it to them.  There was never that ""oh yea"" moment in the film, where we suddenly realized who these two were, and why they were together ... mind, body, and spirit.  Not thinking about the dreadful ""A Walk to Remember"", this film could benefit from a facelift.  Build the two characters stronger together, introduce more problems for the two to solve, really illustrate the confusion between Oliver and his father, and I think you would have yet another blockbuster on your hands.  This is a rich film, executed poorly, but the groundlings are there.  ""Love Story"" felt like a cold flat soda - it still quenches your thirst on a hot day, but it just misses that punch.  Worth at least one viewing for that romantic settling down in all of us.

A large segment of the population was fed up with war movies, ""Easy Riders"", ""Midnight Cowboys"" et al and naturally radiated to Erich Segal's simple novel transformed into a simple film. They got their money's worth. Crowds openly hissed and booed Milland's every move, a sure sign of his commendable performance as the bossy, conceited establishment figure. O'Neal's hatred of him could be felt right through the screen. Macgraw gives an uneven performance; one is often at a loss as to whether her attempts at one-upsmanship over O'Neal are reality or teasing.

It is funny how 37 years must change our views of the world.

We recently rented LOVE STORY and about 60 minutes into the film, my wife commented to me...... ""You can stop the movie if you want, I'm not watching it anyway. It is nowhere near as good as I remember"".

I agreed with her.

I remember the film as being so powerful all those years ago........ now all we could see was some stiff acting, and poor characterization that made us not really care if Ali's character died or not.

Certainly a far cry from the LOVE STORY we remembered.

Another dissapointment from the 70s was BRIANS SONG.

Unless you've never been in love or are inherently cynical you can't appreciate how this film captures the experience of being totally immersed in another person.  The film's catchphrase, ""Love means never having to never say your sorry"" doesn't seem that corny.  Even the film's tragic conclusion doesn't seem contrived or manipulative.  I think it helps that the film's stars, Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw, have kinetic chemistry even though I believe they were married to others at the time(MacGraw was married to Paramount honcho Robert Evans).  An interesting dichotemy here is how the film presents O'Neal and MacGraw's fathers.  O'Neal is saddled with a rich controlling father (Ray Milland) whereas MacGraw's father (John Marley) is a widower and MacGraw kind of assumes the spousal role in her relationship to him.  Now I don't know if that explains the attraction between the two leads but it's interesting food for thought.

250348,3,6300216209,"The sentimentality of ""Love Story"" (""What can you say about a 25-year-old girl who died?"") is a hearty welcome retreat to the past... There is nothing to spoil love, trust, confidence or even the events... Jenny seems to die... She just escapes in loveliness...

Jenny (Ali MacGraw) is half of a pretty young married students from a working class background... And Oliver (Ryan O'Neal) is from a very wealthy family... Both have the predictable problems with disapproving parents... Both struggle along through hard times, until Oliver obtains a fine job with his own merit... When Jenny tries to get pregnant, the doctor finds out that she has an incurable disease, and has a very short time to live...

Ryan O'Neal plays well the intense sensitive rebel, giving a heart-breaking performance as the ultra-rich man's son who works to pay his way through law school when his father won't...

Ali MacGraw is good and touching in her portrait of Jenny, the dying heroine, the poor baker's daughter studying classical music at Radcliffe, the smart young girl who gives up her plans to study in Europe in order to marry Oliver... She never missed a 'shred of her beauty' in her role...

Ray Milland is the 60-year-old Oliver Barrett III... He is a strong, articulate, civilized millionaire from Boston who refuses to support his son in marrying a girl of such low social stature... He commands him instead to finish law school...

John Harley is Phil, the father of Jenny... For him, ""Father's love is something to cherish and respect.""

There is three sequences that I liked the most in the film:

- Jenny and Oliver wonderful kissing scene... From this point on, both were entirely engrossed with each other, ready to risk anything for love...

- Oliver's long day search looking for Jenny, until he sees her sitting, outside, on a stair... She forgot her keys... Jenny is comforted by Oliver who tries to apologize for his continual disputes... Jenny, all shaken, and with tears in her eyes and with an emotional voice stops him with words of deep affection: ""Love means never having to say you're sorry.""

- Oliver, sitting alone and lost to the world, uncertain and perplexed, unable to understand Jenny's tragic fate... If Jenny could spend an hour in his mind, a minute in his heart, a second in his soul to discover what he really feels loving her... Why Jenny has to die so young? Why destiny is against us sometimes, smashing all our hopes and happiness? Why we feel so impotent in front of the will of God? Why can't we understand that we are 'blessed with Life,' and this is our great gift, our true treasure! Barrett's millions could never save Jenny!

The Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran said once: ""Love knows not its own depth, until the hour of separation."" And let me say that 'nothing is more beautiful than the love that has weathered the storms of Life.' They say: Time mends a broken heart and true love never ends... But if true love never ended then time wouldn't have to mend... So ""Love Story"" was followed by ""Oliver's Story"".

Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw are splendid and beautifully matched... Arthur Hill's sincere direction commend the picture to a wide audience eager to a flood of tears...

250370,5,6300216209,"I'm amazed by how many people have written reviews bashing the line which sums up this entire film's essence & message: ""Love means never having to say you're sorry.""  I think people are misunderstanding & misinterpreting this phrase in a way which makes it seem both simplistic (it's not) and implausibly meaningless (again, it's not).  The precise aspect of this film which 'gets' under your skin (if you enjoyed it & understood its subtletly) is summed up in this one line.  If you read the line (or hear it) as meaning that love means never SAYING you're sorry OR never DOING so in a relationship - then it will seem saccharine & of course, untrue.  But if you dig a little deeper you'll see that the word 'having' changes the entire tone of the line -and people are misinterpreting it woefully.  When you love someone as these two characters love each other (and it is a rare love - which is perhaps why so many people are skeptical of its very existence) and understand each other on the level of the spirit and soul - then it is a tacit & implicit understanding at the core level of the relationship that you love the other person unconditionally - faults and all & they love you in precisely the same way. Therefore - to say you're sorry for any number of possible slights, hurts, offenses or bruises which WILL come along in the course of ANY close relationship - is neither necessary or productive WHEN it stems from guilt over something which the other party has ALREADY FORGIVEN YOU FOR because they see straight through to the core of your humanity, know that you're imperfectly flawed & love you just the same.  This line doesn't mean literally 'never say you're sorry to your spouse or significant other'  - it simply means that love on this level has an understanding that goes beyond words & which words cannot elevate any higher - which makes using them superflous at times such as the moment which this line is from. Jenny knows Oliver didn't mean what he said, she already KNOWS he regrets having said it and the fact that the guilt & pain on his face move her to say such a beautiful thing out of truly altruistic/unconditional love is the point of this ENTIRE movie.  Guilt is harmful for both parties in any relationship and never more so than when it is induced or required or elicited by one person seeking an apology from the other - nothing damages a relationship quicker than the demand of apologies for behaviors which are not only human but inevitable. Jenny is simply freeing Oliver up to be who he is, however he is, at any moment - because when he's with her it is understood that he will be accepted regardless of his actions due to the fact that she sees the person & NOT the behavior.  If more people loved in this way today the world would be a much better place. Of course you're GOING to say you're sorry many, many times in a relationship. But if it's a strong, healthy & mature relationship - your apology truly isn't necessary because the other party isn't holding a grudge or expecting it - it is simply a courteous reminder that you admit you behaved badly AND that you respect your mate's feelings- nothing more (if it becomes more & is used like a bargaining chip in a relationship you may as well give up because the other party loves themselves more than you - and that is NOT true, unconditional love.).

This is one of my all-time favorite films for the simple fact that it doesn't spend too much time TRYING to impress the viewer - it is understated where it needs to be, emotive when it's appropriate and a superb example that sometimes less is more in a classic film. If more films stuck to telling a compelling story in a straightforward way today this movie would not stand out - the fact that it does (36 years after its initial release) should tell us something about what the heart & soul truly require of art: to be moved by a situation or moment or life which you can put yourself in the middle of and in doing so you are awakened to the very essence of your own humanity & forever changed.",1163030400,12,4050,4.460810810810811
250371,4,6300216209,"Everyone knows the theme music to this one. From what I hear, the film was a huge hit when it came out in 1970. The ""love story"" involves two students from Harvard: The guy (Ryan O'Neal) is a likable hockey player from an incredibly rich family who doesn't get along with his rigidly high-class father (Ray Milland); the gal (Ali MacGraw) is an intelligent musician from a working-class family who strangely calls her father ""Phil"" and cusses a lot.

When I first saw the film, over four years ago, I didn't much like Ali MacGraw's character. She comes off bizarre and annoying (""Hey preppy"" -- ""preppy"" ""preppy"" ""preppy""). O'Neal's character, on the other hand, I found to be an all-around likable guy -- tough but at the same time very nice, filthy rich yet undenialby humble and respectful.

MacGraw's character kinda turned me off to the the flick the first time I saw it. Seeing it again recently, I enjoyed ""Love Story"" more because I was prepared to handle and embrace her strange personality.

The father/son 'relationship' is very interesting: O'Neal calls Milland ""sir"" at all times. In reality there's NO relationship at all. Hence, what ultimately takes place in the story is both understandable and believable.

There's a funny scene when O'Neal finally takes MacGraw to his family estate to meet his parents. She's understandably overwhelmed when she realizes just how rich O'Neal's family actually is. Her true-to-character reaction made me bust out laughing.

I enjoyed the New England locations and seasonal changes. The setting and tone naturally reminded me of ""Dead Poets Society."" I'm not saying ""Love Story"" is anywhere near as good because ""Dead Poets Society"" is in a class by itself. Yet, ""Love Story"" is a good drama/romance; I technically rate it 3.5/5 Stars. Just keep in mind that it's from 1970. Viewing it is like going back in time; in other words, it's a fascinating period-piece.",1143331200,,1913,4.947040498442368
250372,5,6300216209,"The picture holds up, that is, you may hate it but it hardly ever looks ""60s"" or ""70s.""  Both O'Neal and MacGraw are rather good, I can't imagine what torment Arthur Hiller put Ali MacGraw through to get her to deliver those line readings which, by and large, are pretty appropriate and hardly ever wooden as she usually is in other vehicles.  I femember years later watching the miniseries THE WINDS OF WAR in which she plays Natalie Jastrow and thinking, in retrospect, that Arthur Hiller deserved an Oscar for making her seem like a human being in LOVE STORY.  There's one scene in which she opens an invitation for Oliver's father to his 60th birthday party, a sign she thinks that her father in law might be melting in his opposition to their marriage, and yet she can't make Oliver understand how much this means to her and how very much she wants to go to the party.

Instead he coldly forces her to RSVP and say that they won't go.  Her frustration and pain while she's dialing the phone are palpable, real.  PLUS she's dressed exquisitely, in a khaki green miniskirt with a metallic green and black belt that would look perfectly in vogue today.  It's the kind of scene that sticks with you, especially in a movie so universally reviled, a movie that has millions of fans and yet, for others, it seems to have gone down in history as the sappiest and stupidest movie ever made.

What is with the actor Walker Reynolds, who plays Ryan O'Neal's best friend and racketball partner?  He's like a blond, somewhat stockier Illya Kuryakin.  The racquetball scenes with the two men in crazily tight white cotton shorts and T-shirts is like something out of a Bruce Weber campaign, and their subsequent shower scene should be frozen forever as a certain kinf of Abercrombie & Fitch porn.  The actor is appealing and yet, apparently, never made another movie before or since.  You wonder why he was even in the picture at all.  (He plays ""Ray Stratton."")  The focus of LOVE STORY is almost entirely on one or the other of the two leads, and Jennifer appears to have no girlfriends at all.  She exists in a cocoon first of forbidden love, and then in a hospital bed, after an interlude of watching Oliver skate in a white cable-knit sweater, then they go out for cocoa, and then he asks her what they should do for the rest of the day, she says, ""let's go to the hospital.""  The two of them stagger in a long shot out of Central Park into a cab.  It really looks as though she's going to die in the snow, her legs crumbling in on themselves like Bambi trying to stand up.  When she made it into the cab I was sighing real relief.  I guess somewhere along the way I started to fall for the two lovers.  Her snotty, tart, foul-mouthed ""attitude"" didn't bother me, though it remains startlingly unsaccharine, as though Ruth Gordon should have been playing the part.

One more scene deserves admiration, the one in which Ray Milland, having written a check for Ryan O'Neal for $5000, money to secure an abortion for another girl (or so Milland thinks), sits there ruffling his checkbook after his son has left him with the unexpected words, ""Thank you, Father.""  The expressions which play across Milland's bemused, wrinkled old face are priceless.  You can read his thoughts with a radical transparency, it's a tough acting job and he excels for a minute.  Otherwise he's hampered by a script filled with Freudian cliches.",1143072000,5,3417,4.591433278418451

It was both touching and funny to watch this old movie with friends as our perspective is a lot different 30 some years later.  Overall the plot is a bit thin and is a bit implausable and we were not entirely happy with all of the language as Ali McGraw has a rather foul mouth in the film.

Overall, it worked fairly well for our purposes of attempting to capture a ""romantic"" film from the past for our group.  I think the concepts in the film appealed more to us when we were in our teens and rebelling against authority than today.",1142121600,,727,4.201438848920863

Ali McGraw is so wonderful in this role as the sarcastic but endearing Jenny and Ryan O'Neal is perfect as the hockey playing jock/scion of an old New England family. This tender love story unfolds behind the ivy covered gates and the winter scenes and Francis Lai's soundtrack are exquisite. The movie takes you from undergrad, to law school, marriage and to the tearful conclusion without missing a beat. Ray Milland is brilliant as the snobby and class conscious Oliver Barrett III.

Love Story was just to saccharine, too perfect, which I find revolting. It had its nice moments, but it just dragged on and became revolting. But I was born in the late 80s, so you might understand my opinion that I'm not from this 70s era. The Jenny character I found quite annoying, with her constant pestering. But some positive notes, I liked the opening scene and Oliver's opening statement.

The expectation of sympatico silent udnerstanding doesn't and shouldn't always work.

But to the movie in specific: it was great for its time when moviemaking was far less sophisticated than now, and audiences less demanding of actual plot, dialogue and acting. Ryan O'Neal's acting here is barely servicable at best; Ali MacGraw could NOT act and this movie gave immense testimony to that fact, which was further bolstered by her subsequent movies. The acting from the rest of the cast members was stilted, and the dialogue was never free-flowing or believable. The film was ok for its time and if viewed that way, but if you are going to watch it with a 2005 sensibility and set of cinematic expectations - be prepared to say you're sorry you spent the time.",1121644800,2,1125,4.829015544041451

Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal were virtual nobodies before they played love-struck students Jenny and Oliver in this college movie set around Harvard and Radcliffe. Being a Boston student myself I can tell you one of the most amazing things about this movie is the shooting around this incredible city.

However, there's a lot more to ""Love Story"" than setting - the story is basically yet another modern day Romeo and Juliet - though not exactly, by any means. It's refreshingly simple and touching - and was such a major hit in 1970 (so says my mother) that it attracted around-the-block lines for weeks on end.

The catchphrase, Love means never having to say you're sorry, came 13th in a recent AFI list of top movie quotes of all time - and really, it does catch the essence of this great love movie. These two souls really do understand one another, and if we take nothing else away from this film, it is the understanding of that love, and how it relates to all other loves we have ever had. You really FEEL their love - because of the film's simplicity and captivating flirtatious manner of acting.

But this movie, although it's now 35 years old, is  a ""timeless classic"", and it is just as powerful today as it was in 1970 when it was released. It's a refreshingly direct and simple story about love; about two people entirely devoted to each other. Oliver (O'Neal) is a ""preppie millionaire"" and Jennifer (MacGraw) is ""social zero"". They meet at college, fall in love, and eventually marry. After overcoming social barriers, arrogant parents (Oliver's parents ""cut him off"" after he marries Jenny despite their protestations) and poverty during the first couple of years of their marriage, they seemingly have it all. Oliver becomes a lawyer and Jenny no longer has to work tirelessly to provide the basic necessities, and the couple can now afford to start a family. But just as they had the world at their feet, they're rocked by the news that Jenny is, in fact, dying (of cancer). Indeed, it's heart-wrenchingly sad and touching, and it's a hard person who doesn't at least tear up at the sight of Jenny dying in her loving husband's arms. The movie hits all the right emotional buttons, and you share all the love and heartache Jenny and Oliver go through. O'Neal and MacGraw are brilliant and have great chemistry, and of course the haunting (and now legendary) theme music perfectly captures the intensity and feelings between the couple.

250402,4,6300216209,"Contrary to popular belief, Love Story is not based on a novel by Erich Segal. Author Erich Segal wrote the screenplay first, then adapted it into a novel - which was quickly published before the film's release and became a runaway bestseller.

In 1970, Love Story took the nation by storm and made stars out of Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw. By today's standards, the story has been done so often and so much more dramatically, it seems a bit dated. The film has become very overrated over the years, but it still manages to be a sweet, effective love story, just not as tear enducing as some people say.

With that said, I enjoyed the film a lot. The two leads have wonderful chemistry and deliver powerful performances. The haunting theme has gone down in history and is one of the most recognizable in all of film. It is a beautiful piece that lingers in the mind and is very difficult to forget.

While ""Love Story"" is certainly a pleasant movie, aside from the tragic ending, and one that I enjoy watching, especially for Ali MacGraw's beautiful smile, it is only slightly above average. It of course coined the phrase ""love means never having to say you're sorry"", which sounds good but in fact is worthless tripe. Anyone who knows what love really is also knows the value, the importance of saying ""I'm sorry"" when it is warranted. However it is amazing how many people latched on to this phrase, just because it was in a movie.

This is one of the first films, if not the first, of its kind, and spawned many imitators. It doesn't have the effect I assume it had over thirty years ago, but as far as sappy romances go, this is one of the best I've seen. Worth a watch for its classic status and Best Picture nomination alone. Doesn't hurt that it was also the film debut of a young Tommy Lee Jones.",1092614400,2,1804,4.4410876132930515

I knew that there was a movie based on the book out there and about a month after reading the book I saw the movie. To be brutally honest the movie didn't have the punch and the emotion that the book had had on me. It just seemed kind of choppy, like somebody was going scissor happy in the editing room in 1970. I am not going to say anything about the acting because who am I to give acting directions. I just want to say that we should feel that way the actors portraying the characters feel, and obviously I did because I felt totally disconnected with the characters.{okay, after seeing th movie I found out that Erich Segal had actually written the screen play before actually writing the book} I don't feel that it would be an insult to say that there should be a remake of the movie ""Love Story"" because with the technology and the acting skills of today's actors, producers and directors and what not, it could be great. I watched ""Love Story"" because my dad said it was his favorite movie of all time and that it's the only movie he's ever went to the theatre to watch twice, so I thought that it really had to be a good movie. I did like ""Love Story,"" even though I wouldn't call it one of my favorite movies of all time....I'm more the action, sci-fi, comedy, and horror movie type.
""Love Story"" is good because it seems realistic, just like two normal people who are real different from each other might act in a real life relationship.

For likewise uninitiated it concerns a couple who meet at Harvard from different ends of the social spectrum - she's poor, he's rich - and forge a relationship against all odds.  When the girl contracts cancer though they find their love put to the ultimate test.
If the synopsis I gave above sounds clichd that's probably because the story is clichd, although that doesn't mean to say that the movie is.  In fact, against all odds it actually presents a very moving relationship that will, if nothing else, draw you in.  The acting by the two leads is very good indeed, especially for the genre because they make an often-trodden story seem realistic.  More than anything else it's the presentation of the relationship that makes this a romantic tragedy that's a cut above the rest.  This isn't presented in hyperbole but as something real.  They argue, they tease and they have fun like any other couple.  This is important because it's one of those rare occassions where the 'love to end all loves' is actually presented realistically.  Neither of the leads are stunningly good-looking, and they argue about issues that you imagine yourself arguing about.  More importantly, the moral issue of whether the husband should tell his wife that she has cancer (in a particularly interesting social note today - the husband was told first) is presented very well indeed.  This serves to make the ending quite moving and if the famous line 'Being in love means never having to say you're sorry' (which I hadn't ever attributed to Love Story before watching it) sounds cheesy then for the most part the movie isn't.

And what the heck did they mean by ""Love means never having to say you're sorry!""? Now that really didn't make a lotta sense! God, the whole thing practically bordered on camp! But you know what, if you just go in to see it without any great expectations, but knowing full well what you're getting into, somehow it works! That's the genius of this movie - not great film making, just surprisingly entertaining fluff! Yeah, I hate to admit, I did enjoy it, even though I wasn't born when it was first released, and viewed the movie as a relic of an older generation. Ali Mcgraw was 32 at the time when the movie was made, playing the character of a girl between 20-25. Granted she was beautiful, but c'mon who were they fooling?? Still it's kind of hard to imagine any other actress who could play the Jennifer Cavaleri role better. Ms. Mcgraw with her cute smile, sweet voice, beautiful long hair, and dewey eyes helps make you overlook the obvious, well almost.... It was also kind of interesting to see a cameo appearance by a very young Tommy Lee Jones (with hair no less!). And it's interesting to know that the Oliver Barrett character was inspired by former Vice President Al Gore. I started thinking about this movie again when I saw the 2002 Oscars, and saw a very aged and bloated Ryan O'Neil and Ali Mcgraw (both in their 60's) coming on stage as presenters with the musical score from Love Story playing as they appeared. It was so surreal. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, kinda like my reaction to this movie....",1017792000,2,1883,4.72644376899696
250447,5,6300216209,"Love Story was the 1st film I ever saw.  It was 1970, I was 6, and my parents took us to the drive in.  That may be one reason I like it so much, but I've seen it many times since and it's one of the few films I don't ever get bored watching.  The great soundtrack sets the atmosphere for the relation between Oliver and Jenny, 2 sophisticates at Harvard and Radcliffe who fall in love in the wintertime.  The ending set in New York City strikes an especially relevant chord post-Sept. 11th, when so many faced similar, but even worse circumstances.
  The general feel of the film is one of emotional intensity, and a slice of reality from 1970 in Manhattan and Massachusetts.",1006992000,3,676,4.368
250448,1,6300216209,"I seriously must say that Love Story is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I rented it, anticipating an emotional, tear-jerking masterpiece; man, was I disappointed. The script consists of some of the CHEEZIEST lines- ""being in love means never having to say your sorry"" PLEASE- and the acting is laughable. These kids are supposed to be full of youthful energy and passion- they look about as passionate as a cess pool. Oh, and they could have picked a more varied musical selection- they played the same repetitvely boring theme over and over!",998870400,19,552,4.760416666666667
250449,5,6300216209,"""Love Story"" is a timeless classic that nearly anyone can appreciate, with its touching story and beautiful soundtrack this film is unforgettable. The first track we start off with is ""Theme From Love Story,"" which is a mixture of several instrumental pieces and part of different film sequences in the film. The opening music plays like the words from the beginning of the film ""What can you say about a 24 year old girl who died?"" The second track ""Snow Frolic"" is quite an unusual piece that sounds very French in origin. A very simply chord structure holds the song together with the very basic bass keeping the beat going. I am not sure whom Francis Lai chose to sing this particular song but she does a marvelous job doing so. The next song is Mozarts ""Sonata in F Major,"" which is the type of song that is very pleasant to listen to early in morning when waking up to the sunrise. The fourth song ""I Love You, Phil"" was a piece of music not featured for some reason in the motion picture. What is very interesting about this song is the guitar solo intertwined with the violins and orchestral accompanyment. Tracks 5 (The Christmas Trees) and track 7 (Bozo Barrett) both were not included in the film, yet are well worth listening to. Although I found the ""Barrett"" track too overwhelming to enjoy I felt the ""Christmas Trees"" was a track that contained a beautiful melody and evolved very sweetly. ""Searching for Jenny"" takes you back to the dramatic sequence in the film where Oliver searchs for Jenny. The 8th track ""Skating in Central Park"" is a very sweet tune that sounds like something out of the Nutcracker suite. The next track ""The Long Walk Home,"" is a bit of a dragging song yet some listeners may enjoy it. Concerto No. 3 in D Major is a beautiful allegro by J.S. Bach, unfortuantely it is very short but extremely enjoyable to say the least. Finally, we come to the heart of the Love Story Soundtrack, the finest track on the entire album. The ""Theme from Love Story Finale"" is the definate track that makes this cd such an excellant buy for anyone who is a fan of deep and inspiring music. Sadly, this soundtrack will never recieve the air play it deserves on public radio. But hopefully its popularity will continue to grow in the following years. Enjoy all you Love Story fans!",997920000,2,2301,4.5603864734299515
250450,5,6300216209,"I saw this film in the theater during its original release, and found that although the story was good, the soundtrack was fantastic. I went out the very next day and bought the LP, and nearly wore it out over the next year. Since I had an Akai reel-to-reel deck, I also bought it on a pre-recorded reel in 1972, and put away the LP. The Oscar for best score went to Francis Lai for this soundtrack, and deservedly so. Another album came out during this time entitled 'Francis Lai plays Francis Lai'. I'd never really heard any other music by this French composer before 'Love Story', but bought the album and really enjoyed  the tracks from previous movies, including 'A Man and a Woman', and I believe also 'Rider on the Rain'. I wish I could remember the other tracks, and also wish I could find it on CD. I no longer have the LPs due to their being stolen during a military move in the late '70s. Anyway, listening to the 'Love Story'  soundtrack instantly invokes the emotions associated with the film, so much so that it makes the film seem better than it actually was. It's not often that the score of a film soars above the acting, but this one does. Anyone who enjoys this soundtrack should also check out other albums by Francis Lai.",996364800,3,1243,4.423580786026201
250451,2,6300216209,"Oh yes, this story to many older generation is the starting point and the beginning of love stories drama. The story of this movie is very touching but for now a days the acting is not all that.

250452,3,6300216209,"Yes, even the slightest piano tinkle resonanting the hauntingly memorable musical theme will instantly take you back to the moment you saw this for the first time.
I was a silly pipsqueak of a high school freshman when I first saw this classic tearjerker, and fell for every single sickening, cliched, contrived, overwrought gimmick in the predictable screenplay, over-ambitious music score, and less than subtle acting on behalf of Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw.  But guess what?  There are times when we need to watch films just like this--a film in which we allow ourselves to willingly be led by the nose and heartstrings and force ourselves into a good cryfest.
This is precisely what has granted this piece of 1970 cinema its endurance.  We know it's obvious (""What offends you more Father, that she's Catholic, or poor?""), we know it's preachy (""Love means never having to say you're sorry""), we know the outcome from the very first sentence (""What can you say about a 25 year old girl who died?""), yet none of that matters.
With all its flaws and lack of being original and clever, Americana has had a thirty year love affair with LoveStory.  Don't watch it as high art or even great cinema.  Watch it because you want to feel something.  And hey, the score did win an Oscar, after all.  You'll catch yourself humming it for weeks afterward.

If you love a love story, this is the penultimate one.  Oliver, the Harvard jock,and Jennifer, the poor and smart-mouthed music student from Rhode Island, touch the deepest parts of our hearts.  Theirs is the love story that we all want---two people completely dedicated to each other. They survive class differences and parental disapproval because they love each other.  How wonderful to see the heart-warming snowball scenes when their love is so obvious to viewers.
Of course, it is in the end, a tear-jerker that requires unlimited tissues.  The couple that has it all can not overcome the one thing that is out of their hands.

250454,1,6300216209,"I can't believe all the stars I'm seeing here.  Did these people think they were writing about ""Casablanca"" by mistake?  ""Love Story"" is its own bad joke, surpassed only by ""Lovely Story,"" Burnett and Korman's intentionally hilarious sendup on the old ""Carol Burnett Show.""  MacGraw pouts instead of acts, Segal inserts hip (1970) profanity instead of characterization, and O'Neal amazingly walks away from Milland at the end, when the last line of the novel (in which Oliver cries in his father's arms) was what pushed weepy readers over the edge.  I've read that the snowball-fight montage was inserted after the rest of the film had been shot because the filmmakers realized that the two brats who were their main characters needed a shot of humanity.  Too little too late.  O'Neal himself said it best a year later in ""What's Up, Doc?"" when Streisand said to him, ""Love means never having to say you're sorry.""  He replied, ""That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.""
(If I had to say something nice about the movie, I'd admit under pressure that the counterpoint of Lai's score with the music emanating from the practice rooms where O'Neal is looking for MacGraw was a nice touch.  But I'm not really saying it.)",978652800,22,1214,4.830917874396135

To experience a love so  true and so deep is a miracle and to lose it... it's beyond me. But to even  experience it and see a glimpse of it (from this movie) is a wonder enough.  The love story between rich Harvard hockey-player Oliver Barrett IV (played  by Ryan O'Neal) and smart-mouthed Radcliffe gal Jennifer Cavilleri (played  by Ali McGraw) is one of those once-in-a-lifetime love stories... captured  on film.  These two star-crossed lovers who are from the opposite ends of  the socio-economic ladder overcome all obstacles (disapproving parents,  near poverty and Harvard Law School) to make their love work. The only  thing going for them was their love and devotion to each other. And just  when things were finally looking up... tragedy strikes.
The book written  by Eric Segal is even more moving but to see the movie, is just as a great  experience. It's not just a tearjerker! It's truly a masterpiece! I LOVE  THIS MOVIE! It's my ALL TIME favorite movie.
