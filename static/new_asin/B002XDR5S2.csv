8383627,1,B002XDR5S2,"This is a silent movie that I bought for historical purposes. I would put it in the ""kind of interesting"" category, but is not very interesting to watch.",1488499200,,153,4.5
8383628,2,B002XDR5S2,"This movie has a very promising start. William Haines' character is initially a rather likeable prankster - there is a great scene where he is ""inspecting"" the new Army recruits before getting off the ship at West Point. It doesn't take long for the likeable prankster to turn into an insufferable comedian - and even though that may be the ""point"" of the whole thing, it is simply TOO MUCH for a silent film that's over 95 minutes long! It MIGHT have worked if the film only ran for 65 minutes or so, like some other MGM films from the same era.

The second reason I said the film has a very promising start is because it APPEARS at first that Joan Crawford is going to be the leading lady much like she was in ""Spring Fever"" the year before (also with William Haines). Instead, she turns out to be the 'leading lady' in name only because her character VIRTUALLY DISAPPPEARS after the first few scenes - only returning sporadically for extremely brief periods of time. She is given a fantastic introduction as the kind of VERY STRONG FEMALE LEAD that will have almost equal screen time with Haines, with an emotional journey/arc and solid character development of her own, as in 'Spring Fever' - but her character development over the course of the story is *NIL*, and her SOLE PURPOSE turns out to be standing around as a (sometimes reluctant but nevertheless smitten) cheerleader for Haines. I was shocked and appalled that she would be treated like this at THIS stage of her career - you would think it were still 1925 when she first arrived in Hollywood and hadn't proved her abilities yet.

It is by far *THE MOST THANKLESS ROLE* that Joan Crawford ever played in her life!! Serioisly. Even her first bit part as Norma Shearer's double in 'Lady of the Night' had more meat in it!!!!!! She was just thrown into THIS film as though it were some kind of token cameo role (and one that turns out to be UTTERLY DEGRADING TO WOMEN at that, as I demonstrated above!!)

William Blakewell does NOT play Joan's other love interest, contrary to what another reviewer said. He plays William Haines' cohort/companion/room-mate, and his performance is oftentimes overly exaggerated - almost coming across as the stereotypical silent film actor who ""telegraphs"" and goes overboard in the process - but that applies just as much to William Haines himself, of course, in this film. I guess the director was simply not one of MGM's finest. Blakewell does manage to be effective in the hospital room scenes - and indeed the film has its moments of genuine human emotion and psychological resonance, but they seem to be too few and far between.

I like what the writers seem to have been going for at CERTAIN TIMES - for instance, telling a story about MALE COMPANIONSHIP rather than a typical male/female romance (in fact, at one point William Haines' character refers to Blakewell's character as his ""boy-friend"", even though we are not supposed to infer anything sexual from that) - but I just don't think the acting (by the male leads), the direction, and ultimately the writing itself HIT THE MARK!!",1441497600,,3090,4.706099815157116

8383630,4,B002XDR5S2,I love the retrospect of watching Joan or Bette transition to the great stars they became. These coquette movies so a glimpse of what will be in the future. The stories are all rather silly but that isn't what you watch the movie for.,1394496000,2,234,4.340909090909091
8383631,5,B002XDR5S2,"This was my first movie of William Haines I have seen. I read lot things about this openly gay actor who had left the film business in 1934 for his love Jimmie Fields.

The movie itself looks on DVD great for a old movie from 1927. Almost no defects for a ""not"" restored/remastered movie.

Also the background score is very nice to listen.

William Haines plays wonderful. The theme itself is serious but contains any funny scenes. Also William Bakewell as other love interest of Joan Crawford is wonderful.

Trivia: William Bakewell was later also in Gone With the Wind in a small role.",1276732800,2,587,4.615384615384615
8383632,5,B002XDR5S2,"""West Point"" was although not a breakthrough role for Joan still afforded her moderate success in a classic MGM silent. In this silent Joan plays the role of Betty Channing, opposite William Haines. What I enjoyed most about this film was both the background music (which fits in perfectly with the movie) and all of the humor. I don't know if it was meant to be funny necessarily but some of the acting and even some of the title cards (such as: ""I wonder if cadettes wear corsets to get that military shape"") were pretty funny. I am not really a person who goes nuts over silents (I go nuts for Joan.) But if you're like me, I don't think it's fair to compare this movie to other talkies, compared to other silents it has always been one of my favorites.

Once speaking about this movie Joan described ""West Point"" as ""a throwaway for me."" I don't think that was the case at all because it was a great role for her and there was a lot of chemistry between her and Billy Haines (he was like her Clark Gable of the '20s). I also enjoyed many of Joan's dresses and outfits because as usual she always looked stunning. But I think this is really one of the first films that the studio was told to make her into ""Joan Crawford.""

""West Point"" was filmed on location. And, there are a lot of military scenes (which is backed by that drumming sound) but ""West Point"" is certainly not a war-era movie. It's actually more about sports than anything else because Brice (William Haines) was expelled from the school's team for not showing ""enough spirit."" They must have really been strict in the '20s.

This is a DVD-R which is made by Warner Archives/Warner Bros. The DVD-R's are made to order and include a silkscreen picture on the discs, and a brief description of the movie on the back of the packaging, however the cases are not sealed. If you find these prices rather high you may want to wait for the film to be shown on TCM (it's shown at least once or twice a year).

Remember, you are what you watch.",1259539200,5,2003,4.376344086021505

The movie gets 5 stars, however these sellers (Joan would have called them filthy crooks) are just as useless as they are greedy. They turn up on Amazon and on ebay selling all of her silents at 2, sometimes even 3 times the price. Keep in mind they are not authorized resellers and are only providing a great disservice to anyone who collects these films. I really wish Warner Archive/Warner Home Video would take better control of their distribution. Perhaps if they offered better pricing and marketing and actually partnered with Amazon customers would not run away from them in droves for alternatives (because frankly I know from experience that Warner Archives/The WB Shop is not much better).",1255996800,,963,5.694444444444445
