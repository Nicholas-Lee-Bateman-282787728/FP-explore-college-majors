8431394,5,B004IZKKPS,"I have only been free motion quilting for about 8 months as of this writing, so I speak with less experience than others may have. As a relatively new machine quilter, I have been taking classes and buying books to gather patterns, tips and ideas. This DVD is full of them. Patsy is a comfortable teacher with practical helps and a myriad of design ideas. She walks you through the basics of machine quilting and the process of each design to help you create it yourself. Patsy's designs are downloadable free on her website, but the DVDs help you learn tips to make the process easier, and they also include some variations of the designs that are not included in the downloads. I admit that I like the designs much better when I see them actually stitched in fabric than when I just saw the line drawings of the downloads. In this volume Patsy covers several ""families"" of designs, including loop-d-loops, lines and angles, arches and igloos. A more experienced quilter might not need her tips for FMQ, but they may still enjoy the variety of designs presented. You can check out her website to see the designs, and then decide for yourself if you would like to have Patsy teach you her methods to make them.",1339200000,5,1210,4.580645161290323
