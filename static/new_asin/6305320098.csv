1008872,3,6305320098,"Homer.  That's all I want from the Simpsons.  Marge is annoying, Bart is a weener, Lisa never shuts up, and Maggie annoys me the least out of these four!  Homer is the most deasent charactor on the show, and these episodes  focus on the other four or anothor annoying charactor on the show.  Only  the Homer episodes are worth watching.",959040000,,336,4.516666666666667
1008873,5,6305320098,"Don't get me wrong: I loved almost every single episode of ""Seinfeld.""  But I cannot stress it enough - for my money, ""The Simpsons"" is the best show in the history of television . .  . EVER!
Even when he's relegated to the sidelines, Homer Simpson is the  glue that holds this marvelous achievement of pop culture together.  The  ultimate selfish, oafish, boorish, and just about every other pejorative  -ish you cand find, Homer's sole redeeming quality is his childlike quality  and this, ultimately, is why he is such an endearing character.  Comparisons to Archie Bunker are misplaced.  Homer may be ignorant, but  there isn't a mean-spirited bone in his body, that ultimate tribute to  flabbiness.
The episodes in this volume, given their  ""political"" nature, include some of the most subtle, intelligent  and all around hilarious writing in the show.  That such a marvelous, rich  and textured piece of entertainment came out of TV is little short of a  miracle.  Buy this now and enjoy it in the intimacy of your home with a  cool, refreshing Duff beer.",958003200,5,1061,4.865168539325842

1009273,5,6305320098,"Simpsons Season 5 is full of so many, many great moments - the funky music of the B Sharps, Richard Nixon jokes, Mister Burns' birthday (with a guest appearance by the Ramones!!), the freakish Smithers-bot, nutty surreality in the Treehouse of Horror art exhibit, the Devil and Homer Simpson, Bart and the school bus gremlin, aliens, Burns the vampire, the infamous Thelma and Louise tribute (""Homer, are just holding on to that can of soda?""), Bart's Squishy bender and his stint as a Boy Scout (!!), the My Dinner With Andre video game (!!!), ""Don't do as Donny Don't does."" Crazy camping with Ernest Borgnine, ""Homer loves Mindy"" with the voice of Michelle Pfeiffer, great Colonel Klink jokes, Henry Kissinger's glasses, gambling fever and the only time Marge misbehaved and Homer was the voice of reason, prophetic Las Vegas predictions of Siegfried and Roy, Bart hating fame as the I Didn't Do It kid and James Woods' cameo; Kathleen Turner and the Barbie wars, Homer the astronaut, the episode where Homer becomes Flanders' friend (and Flanders hates it), more surreal Clinton moments, Homer hallucinating with Mr Clean and other bathroom products, an elephant! The ""D'oh, a deer, a female deer"" joke, the Six Million Dollar Man, Bart as Burns' protege, the time Skinner gets fired and Bart helps him get his job back, young Ned 'whoopsy doodle"" Flanders and his beatnik parents - ""Ohhhh... Ned spilt ink on my poems!"" The unibrow baby, a cameo by Matt Groening as a courtroom artist, the Simpsons as pink-skinned kids with five fingers, Grampa Simpson vs C Montgomery Burns vying for the affections of Marge's mom, Marge kicks Homer out of the house, and see scenes from Smithers' troubled marriage! Totally nutso stuff!

""He's innocent of not being guilty.!"" ""Nice gams! you're one nifty number."" ""Whoop-dee-doo, Mr President."" ""I've been separated from you for a day and already I'm as dirty as a Frenchman!

Disc1 has an ""Animation Showcase"" of the Treehouse of Horror IV"" opening sequences (8:33). Disc 2 has another ""Animation showcase"" (5:30) with a ""News on Parade Springfield in several versions with animated commentary of the same, which is kind of silly and awkward. Disc 3 contains an animation showcase"" (5:23) showing 3-in-one from the Stampy episode. Disc 4 contains a whole bunch of bonus stuff, such as 21:33 of deleted scenes (although this section is fluffed up by some material that was seen in the show). Great Bond casino irony scene where Bond loses the impossible bet (we can only dream...). Apu's wig. ""Simpsons' own mariana sauce? Now that's Italian!!"" Sweet Seymour Skinner's..."" in Italian, Czech, Polish and Hungarian (!?!?). ""A look back with James L Brooks"" (3:50), talking about the famous Nine Ways To Die In LA comic that Books saw. The wall of magazine covers that grew; many of the magazines had nothing to do with TV (like Institutional Investor!!).",1436745600,,2893,4.987577639751553
1009274,5,6305320098,"The Simpsons are probably going to be the longest running cartoon series in history by now. The fifth season was way back in 1993-1994 over twenty years ago. The series is still going strong in over twenty seasons. The fifth season has some of the best and wittiest episodes in cartoon history. The Simpsons are bit less controversial than Family Guy but the latter wouldn't have been without the Simpsons. The Simpsons were the first animated series in decades on network television even though it was Fox. The Simpsons came on during the Tracey Ullman Show in animated bits and has become a cultural phenomenon worldwide.

The fifth season collector's edition includes all 22 episodes and extras such as commercials involving the Simpsons characters. There are extras like the animation behind the scenes of the series. That is a must for any animation buff or Simpsons fan. I have four DVDs in my collection not three as it is stated in the production description. The DVD also includes a booklet with detailed information about every episode and extra features.",1435708800,,1065,4.949720670391062

From the bone-tickling episodes such as Cape Feare and Homer Loves Flanders to heartwarming storylies like Secrets of a successful marriage to just plain-o-whacko episodes like deep space homer, you cant go wrong with The Simpsons-The Complete Fifth Season. One thing i hate is the constant breaking of the fourth wall in this season. I mean one episode is hilarious, two is just as funny, but almost every other episode is just too much (i.e. lisa tells bart cartoons don't have to be 100%real as another homer passes through thw window, homer turning into popeye) but i cant complain because this season is just so awesome, i can overlook these things and have a good time watching these classic episodes.",1407542400,,797,4.955223880597015

1009665,5,6305320098,"Season 5 saw the departure of a few good writers, leaving big shoes to fill for the newcomers that did a great job holding their own. Conan O' Brien Produced some of this season as well as last season before he got his own late night show and had to leave. He does, however make a cameo appearance in ""Bart gets Famous"". A little FYI for ya! This season contains 22 episodes and won the Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production, Environmental Media Award for Best Television Episodic Comedy, and a Genesis Award for Best Television Comedy Series with 4 Emmy nominations as well.

 This season has more episodes (great ones too) based on Homer. Episodes such as ""Deep Space Homer"" Homer Simpson an astronaut!?... Why not! Add it to his long listed resume of jobs. ""Homer the Vigilante"" A crime spree hits Springfield with dozens of burglaries by the cat burglar. This causes Flanders to form a meeting to organize a neighborhood watch and of course, Homer ends up the leader of the group with the power going to his head. ""Homer goes to College"" Yup, Homer gets to live up the party frat guy life! or so he thinks as he has been influenced a bit too much by college party movies. ""Secrets to a Successful Marriage"" Homer a teacher for a successful marriage class? Oh the things we'll learn! There are a few more, but it's clear to see that Homer is main dude now which I have absolutely no problem with! I love Homer!

Special features contain commentaries for all episodes, audio outtakes, original sketches, deleted scenes, commercials featuring The Simpsons, animation showcases, ""A Look Back"" featurette with James L. Brooks, and an introduction by Matt Groening. This season is great for Homer fans especially. It will have you shouting ""Whoo-Hooo!"" Well it did for me!

After many years of dedicated watching, I stopped keeping up with the new seasons. They just aren't that good.

But Season Five is undoubtedly the greatest season of the Simpsons ever produced. Here, you see the Simpsons at its best: smart, witty satire that says something, strong character development, and just great humor and plots overall. These episodes came out in 1993, when I was an infant, so I don't even understand half the cultural references...which just speaks to how great this season is when it can still be funny and smart even if you miss some of the references.

Honestly, there isn't a single episode in this season that isn't packed with comedic and creative genius. My favorite episode is ""Homer Goes to College"", with ""Deep Space Homer"" coming in a close second. But really, they are all fantastic. I've watched every episode multiple times and haven't grown tired of any of them. Buy this season.

1009893,5,6305320098,"I was at most a reluctant fan of The Simpsons when they first hit TV with their own series. I'd never seen them on the Tracy Ulman show. But being at the time a kid who liked funny voices it wasn't long before I became every bit as hooked as my brother and sister. And I still enjoy the funny voices and can pull off a fair few of them myself. This season harbors some of the funniest episodes I remember seeing as a kid, not the least being Boyscouts 'N the Hood, in which Bart and Millhouse go on a Squishee bender and join the Junior Campers. That of course leads to their taking their disastrously ill-fated rafting trip during which Ned Flanders delivers the immortal line of ""God speed, little doodle."" Also of note are Homer's Barber Shop Quartette, whose rise to fame almost exactly parodies that of The Beatles. And let's not forget the Treehouse of Horror which, while not my absolute favorite (that would probably be Treehouse V), is still well worth watching. An excellent season well worth owning. And this is the first time where we see the normally unflappable Ned Flanders lose his temper, which he does in church in front of a considerable number of witnesses. Needless to say, an excellent collection.

  Many of the special features are, I'm sure, not very accessible to blind folks like myself, however I did discover that my DVD player's remote features a button that allows me to instantly switch between the available audio tracks on a given DVD (I'm sure most do but it was still kinda neat), so I was able to listen to the fascinating and often hilarious commentary on each episode. Whereas only one voice actor came in to do commentary on an episode in Season 4, that being Hank Azaria,, most of the voice cast returns in this season to talk about A FEW EPISODES. Harry Shearer is once again absent (I wanna find out which character of his comes close to his normal voice), as are Julie Kavner and Nancy Cartwright. It's still quite fascinating to hear however, particularly when Homer Simpson welcomes you to the commentary for Boyscouts 'N the Hood. In short, The Simpsons season 5 is four disks of nostalgia packaged in a nice rectangular box for your enjoyment. If you're a true fan you should definitely own this set. I imagine I'll buy up to season 10, which is where I feel the series started to lose its direction and came to rely too much on guest voices.

If this is your first look into The Simpsons, I think it would still be worth buying.  Although, I would recommend starting at season 1 and going from there.
The commentaries for this season are fantastic to listen to.  They also have great guests that will pop on for a commentary as well.  Those guests are usually ones that did voices on the show.

1009943,5,6305320098,"The Simpsons' fifth season (1993/94) falls just short of the radar in terms of the apparent attempts (by British TV at least) to rerun the show into submission by scheduling every episode from seasons 6 through 9 in almost weekly rotation. In this sense therefore, there is likely to be a few gems in this set which may have evaded even avid viewers for a year or two at least. The last thing The Simpsons needs is another champion, so I won't preach about how great the show is (please see below). What I will say is that the commentaries are both amusing and informative in their own right and have ultimately served to enhance my appreciation of the show. All in all (whilst not my own all-time favourite) a classic season with some canonical episodes.

I have chosen a line or exchange of dialogue from each of season 5's episodes that always amuses me (as opposed to episode synopses) and listed them below. I hope you can get a laugh out of them too.

1. `Homer's Barbershop Quartet'

* Willie: ""Me mule wouldn't walk in the mud - so I had to put 17 bullets in `im.""

14. `Lisa vs. Mailbu Stacey'

* Lisa: ""It's awful being a kid. No one listens to you.""
* Grandpa: ""It's rotten being old. No one listens to you.""

Unless you're a die-hard Simpsons fan I respectfully suggest you skip this set and move onto to one of the other collections.  (Seasons 1-4, for example, are excellent buys.)

So why does Season Five come up short?  Perhaps the departure of staff writer Conan O'Brien created a temporary creative vacuum that the show's remaining writers were somehow unable to fill.  I don't know.  All I can say is there's a chunk of episodes in this set where for some reason the show seems to be completely off its stride.  During the ""Springfield"" episode, I was temped to invoke Comic Book Guy's classic line ""Worst. Episode. Ever.""  Because that episode definitely was.

If I had to break it down, I would definitely say that the best episodes in this fifth season set can be found on discs 1 and 4.  The weaker episodes are concentrated on discs 2 and 3.  To sum up: a good buy for Simpsons fans but there are better ones out there.",1169856000,3,1209,4.677725118483412

1009980,5,6305320098,"I'm a die-hard Simpsons fan. I mean, loyal. As in, will protest any argument in the world which might shun the show, or even reasonably argue that there are shows that stand above it. Mind you, when I say ""The Simpsons"", I mean the show that ended nearly a decade ago. To me, ""The Simpsons"" lasted about nine or so phenomenal years, and then slowly plunged into an entity of shameful mediocrity. I mean, frankly, it's not really that upsetting; despite the fact that the show's ""reputation"" has been tarnished entirely (in an opinion like mine -- which I know many agree with), one thing evades any overall judgement on its decision to blindly continue (to this day) into the relatively wretched state it's currently in, and has been for far too long now. Without really getting into the vehement criticisms, however, I'm going to (appropriately) move on to the product in question -- the DVD for Season 5.

Season 5, for me, is a definite contender for the strongest within the series, and its seemingly endless existence. It is surrounded naturally by seasons 4, 6, and 7, and in my opinion these are the three other trophy competitors. Here's why:

The writing here is little else than stunning. Literally. When you watch most shows nowadays -- such as the huge phenomenon ""Family Guy"" -- it becomes apparent that there is absolutely no comparison to the glory days of ""The Simpsons"". Where even the best of shows might have, oh, 60% of the jokes that work (and that's being generous), ""The Simpsons"" at this point in time was always near 80%. You don't have a half-baked group of guys throwing out impulsive ideas at 2am coming down from a good high. You have a dedicated, talented crew passionate about their production and the result is magnificent. Far as I know, the writer writes the show, then comes the storyboard, then the animation which is finalized in Japan (or China??). In one of the commentaries somewhere (on this disc or another), a producer mentions that literally hundreds of jokes come to fruition and they work their way down to however many are needed for the episode. Naturally, you get twenty minutes of uproarious material that almost never dips to a merely satisfactory condition. Next, you've got the crew behind the animation. The directors here are 'so' unbelievably talented. Like the season before it, you get a great gist of the individual personalities and expressions of the crew. Mark Kirkland's episodes are more kooky; Jim Reardon's cynical and angry (my personal favorite); Wes Archer's craziness, etc. And along these lines, you get entirely different episodes entirely; the Homer, Lisa, etc on Reardon's are entirely different than the Homer and Lisa, etc of Kirkland's. And yet, it's ultimately still the same show, and I think it's this wonderous fact that makes it so diverse and compelling; it's not one mood but several, coming from the handful of different writers, directors, and the voice acting. On to that, it's as good as it's ever been. Not to dismiss the many others, but what needs to be stated is Dan Castellaneta's performance as Homer. At this point it's absolutely PRISTINE. I hold this guy in such awe. If you're into details, just watch the ""Homer Goes to College"" episode and you'll see what I mean. I can't explain it, truly, but what he can do with one line is genius beyond genius, and any description of such a finely crafted art is futile. Without doubt, at least for me, his voice acting is the pinnicle in the art and has not been superceeded by any other in the history of television. In the far later, unimpressive seasons, it would change for the worse, but here it's just perfect in every -- single -- way. Oh, and one last thing, resorting to the animation -- it's splendid. These are huge universes, not pale or rushed. There is a reason the show costs some million dollars to produce each episode; there are numerous people working on it -- incredibly talented, costly people -- and it shows. Furthermore when one gets to the comedic aspect of the animation -- which is EVERY bit as important as any other element -- the nuances are hysterical and unmatched. Oh yes! One thing that I firmly believe in, depressingly, is that in this season the show is hand-drawn, opposed to digitally rendered, which would ultimately takeover a few years later, due to ease of use and such. Call me crazy, but the rawness and subtleties of the non-computerized, visual complexion of the show is now sorely missed.

OK, I'm done. No thought out concluding paragraph, for I'm devoid of energy now. I can't state enough how much I admire ""The Simpsons"" at this stage, despite my attempts. When I think of Heaven, I hope it's as satisfying as the most intimate moments of laughter I've been blessed with from this show. If there's a God, he may have all the love and forgiveness as the benign religions say, but he also has a wickedly bizzare sense of humor, and that is displayed in this unmatched DVD.",1158537600,5,4961,4.732947976878613

This is arguably one of the funniest Simpsons seasons to date. The great thing about the Simpsons is that though it is a comedic show, it is probably the only one I know of that is still family friendly.

1009985,5,6305320098,"Me, being a longtime fan of the Simpsons, since I was a child, was yearning to bring the family to my 20"" screen television, and now I have. Out of all 7 seasons that are out on DVD so far, I'd say this season, and the fourth season are the two funniest ones ever!

I say this because this season packs some really funny episodes, some of which are some of my personal favorites, including:

Rosebud: I'd say it's a cute episode, because of the way you see Maggie holding a teddy bear that used to belong to Mr. Burns as a kid. Homer's ""cheeky"" impression of Mr. Burns is a real hoot as well as the Ramones' appearance (""Go to hell you old [...]!"")

Treehouse of Horror IV: One of the funniest, if not THE funniest TOH episodes. Homer sells his soul to the devil for a donut, Bart finds a menacing gremilin on the side of the bus, and the Simpsons family meet Burns/Dracula with one of the most random endings in a Simpsons episode.

The Last Temptation of Homer: Sheer hilarity and risqueness ensue in this episode, where Homer becomes infatuated with a sexy employee that's a lot like Homer; loves to eat donuts, be lazy and everything.

Deep Space Homer: Homer becomes an astronaut, plain and simple. Includes two of my favorite Simpsons gags which are: where Homer eats floating potato chips in the rocket to the tune of the Blue Danube and crashes into an ant farm; and the other being the news showing a ""giant"" ant up close in the camera and news anchorman Kent Brockman stating that a race of giant space ants took over the rocket.

Homer Loves Flanders: The title explains it all: Homer liking Flanders and Flanders becoming more and more annoyed by Homer's interference. I LOVE this episode; It's loaded with downright funny gags from Homer forgetting his troubles in ""Two Tickets to Paradise"" to Marge getting drunk from the spiked water supply from the city of Shelbyville; from the insane Simpsons/Flanders boating trip scene to the spoofs on Vertigo [...]

These are just a few of the funniest episodes, so there are plenty to choose from in this set! Enjoy, Simpsons Fans!",1146787200,,2087,4.564171122994653

 Springfield-I call him Gamblore! And it's time to realease your mother from his neom claws! From Homer
Homer The Vigilante-No no, dig up, stupid! From Chief Wiggum

 Rosebud-Moldy?! Old?! I'm going to get something to eat! From Homer.
Treehouse of Horror IV-Uh, dad, that's his crotch. From Lisa

 Burn's Heir-Give it a try! It's like kissing a peanut! From Homer

 Boy Scoutz N The Hood-Mmmmm....Free goo. from Homer. My all time favorite Simpson line!!!

 Homer Loves Flanders-From Lenny:What did he say? From Carl: I don't know, something about being gay.

 Homer And Apu-Uhhh...I like to keep a lollypop there. From Homer

 Deep Space Homer-We'll be fine as long as we don't go to that terrible planet of the apes...wait! Statue of Liberty...THAT WAS OUR PLANET!!! You maniacs! You destroyed it! D*** you! D**you all to h**!!! From Homer and yes I Know that's a reference to Planet Of The Apes.

 Cape Feare-Guy:When I say hello Homer Thompson and step on your foot, you smile and nodd, okay? Homer:Got it! Guy:Hello Mr. Thompson! Homer: I think he's talking to you.

 But all of the episodes are great and have memorable lines. My favorite season will always remain Season 3, but this is still a great Simpson season that will make you laugh hard.

1010020,5,6305320098,"The Complete Fifth Season of The Simpsons ran from September 1993 until May 1994 and is perhaps the most essential DVD box set of all seven released to date. This season is seen by many to be the pinnacle of The Simpsons' genius, where nearly every episode is an undeniable classic with truly brilliant gags and one-liners every minute. Matt Groening's brilliant creation was fast becoming the best TV show on television, and certainly the most witty and clever. By the end of the decade major critics would be hailing it as the best show ever created. The box set design is brilliant, adopting a theatrical look with the family members on stage with many other characters and burlesque dancers when you fold out the deluxe packaging. The booklet that explains the episodes and special features is in the same style as the previous four.

Season Five opens with ""Homer's Barbershop Quarter."" In this episode the family are at a flea market when they discover an old barbershop quartet album starring Homer. This leads Homer to reminisce about a band he was in called The Be Sharps. ""Cape Feare"" sees Sideshow Bob released from prison and out for yet more revenge on Bart. The garden rake scene is hilarious and one of the show's most famous ever. In ""Homer Goes To College,"" to keep his position at the nuclear plant, Homer must re-enroll at college, but he tries too hard to convert his experience into a rowdy riot. Mr. Burns has a birthday celebration in ""Rosebud"" which is very extravagant, yet he craves for his old teddy bear Bobo that he hasn't seen since his childhood. A furious struggle ensues when Maggie finds the bear and wants to keep it for herself. ""Treehouse Of Horror IV"" is my favourite Treehouse Special up until this point in the show. Homer sells his soul to the Devil (Flanders), Bart sees a gremlin on the side of the bus (watch out for Uder's bag of marzipan Joy Joy's!), and Mr. Burns invites the Simpson family up to his house in a vampire-style short.

In ""Marge On The Lam,"" Marge starts going on nights out with next door neighbor Ruth Powers. The two wind up on a wild police chase in a scene reminiscent from Thelma & Louise. ""Bart's Inner Child"" sees Homer buy a trampoline which injures many of the town's children. Bart Goodman, the host of a videotape that Marge order to help her family communicate better, comes to Springfield and advises the town to get in touch with their inner child like Bart, with disastrous results. In ""Boy-Scoutz 'N The Hood,"" Bart and Milhouse end up in the boy scouts after drinking too much extra syrupy squishees. Homer and Flanders must accompany them on a father-son rafting trip that goes awry. ""The Last Temptation Of Homer"" sees Homer tempted to stray from his marriage when Mindy, a sexy new co-worker, joins the nuclear plant. In ""$pringfield (Or, How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love Legalized Gambling),"" the town legalizes gambling which leads Mr. Burns to open a casino and resulting in Marge becoming an addict. A cat burglar terrorizes Springfield in ""Homer The Vigilante,"" prompting Homer to lead a mob of vigilantes who try to catch the thief but are unsuccessful until Grandpa comes to the rescue.

In ""Bart Gets Famous,"" Bart is hired as Krusty the Clown's assistant after he sneaks out of a field trip to a cardboard box factory. Bart gets a spot on a sketch, but messes it up and says ""I didn't do it!"" This catchphrase soon becomes the talk of the town as Bart is catapulted to celebrity. ""Homer And Apu"" sees Homer go undercover to reveal that Apu is selling out of date meat at the Kwik-E-Mart. Apu loses his job and lives with the Simpsons until he goes to India with Homer to appeal to the head of the Kwik-E-Mart. Lisa is angered by the sexism remarks that the new Malibu Stacy doll makes in ""Lisa Vs. Malibu Stacy."" She complains to the original maker of the doll who helps her make her own doll modelled around Lisa, which proves unsuccessful. In ""Deep Space Homer,"" Homer and Barney are trained as astronauts when an attempt is made to find the average man and put him in space. Homer is sent on a voyage with Apollo 11 veteran Buzz Aldrin. In ""Homer Loves Flanders,"" Flanders invites Homer to a football game and gives him the game ball. Homer is so flattered that he becomes best pals with Flanders, who soon gets annoyed by Homer's over-affectionate nature.

""Bart Gets An Elephant"" sees Bart win an elephant in a radio giveaway. After it turns out to be uncontrollable and destructive, the Simpsons decide to give him over to an animal refuge. In ""Burns' Heir,"" Bart is chosen by Mr Burns to be his next heir to the nuclear plant business. He tried to model Bart around his evil ways, and forces Bart to choose between him and his real family. In ""Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song,"" the show's 100th episode, Bart brings Santa's Little Helper to show and tell. The dog wreaks havoc in the school and causes Skinner to lose his job. Flanders replaces Skinner, but Bart manages to get Skinner his old job back when Flanders imposes his Christian rulings on the school. In ""The Boy Who Knew Too Much,"" Bart witnesses an incident between Mayor Quimby's son Freddy and a waiter. Freddy is accused of beating the waiter and goes on trial. Bart can exonerate Freddy, but only by admitting he skipped school. In ""Lady Bouvier's Lover,"" Marge's mother is wooed by both Grandpa and Mr. Burns. She nearly marries Burns but soon sees his evil nature. The last episode of the season is ""Secrets Of A Successful Marriage,"" in which Homer becomes an adult education teacher. He reveals intimate details about his marriage to a nosey class. Marge is infuriated and kicks Homer out, forcing him to live in Bart's treehouse.

Since I bought The Complete First Season of The Simpsons on DVD earlier this year, I have become obsessed with the show. I think the show was a bit before my time because I never watched it much as a child, I always found it a bit strange and sometimes scary. I was young and I didn't understand what I know now, and I watch The Simpsons for all the satirical lampooning it does so well. There are some very clever and sly jokes in this show. Not everyone will get them, but if you pay attention you should. My dad thinks the show's a bit rubbish, he's always moaning that it's always on the TV. I swear he needs to open his mind and just use his brain to see how brilliant The Simpsons is! Season Five is definitely my favourite to date and is simply television operating at a pioneering, genius level of quality.",1135900800,4,6531,4.5977701543739276
1010021,5,6305320098,"There tends to be big debate on the best Simpsons season. It's either the fourth or the fifth for many people and I tend to say they're tied with the fifth edging it out. This was where the show found its niche: creative satire mixed with funny jokes and one-liners. Even if an episode may not be a classic, it's certainly got something to laugh at in each episode. These are disc highlights.

Season premiere Homer's Barbershop Quartet in a funny clever parody of the Beatles finds Homer reminiscing about his time in the Be Sharps, a barbershop quartet. Cape Feare finds Sideshow Bob returning to kill Bart forcing the Simpsons...sorry, the Thompsons to move somewhere else.  In a nice episode, Mr Burns longs for his bear Bobo, only to have it end up in the hands of Maggie who's not willing to give it up.

Boy-Scouts N the Hood has Homer, Bart, Ned and Todd(or Rod?) stranded in a boat away from shore while Ernest Borgnine has his own adventures with the kids including our favorite hockey masked killer. Homer finds his exact match when Mindy works at the plant, prompting some ignoring in the Last Temptation of Homer. $pringfield(or how I learned to stop worrying and love legalized gambling) has Burns open a casino giving Marge an excuse to develop a gambling problem.

In a clever satire on the overexposure of the Simpsons, Bart gets famous with a catchphrase that starts to wear thin in Bart Gets Famous. Homer gets Apu fired and James Wood becomes his replacement in Homer and Apu. A classic in Deep Space Homer has him going into space and saving the day only to have the credit go to a rod.

Burns in a near-death accident decides he needs an heir and finds it in Bart in what else, Burns' Heir. The 100th episode Sweet Seymour Skinner's Badassss song has Skinner getting fired with new principal Ned Flanders in tow. Season finale Secrets of a Successful Marriage has Homer teaching a class that doesn't bode well until he reveals intimate details about him and Marge.

There's so many classic moments it's hard to mention them all: Sideshow Bob's frequent run-ins with a garden tool, Burns wanting the Rolling Stones killed, Homer eating chips to the tune of Blue Danube; an episode that also contains my favorite season 5 line ""careful, they're ruffled!"".

The successful episode ratio to the flat ones are rather slim. There's not a lot of clunkers here and even if an episode isn't classic like Rosebud or Deep Space Homer, it's usually a funny episode regardless or has several joke that works. This was also the season where guest stars didn't feel like marketing stunts. There was even characters that you didn't know where guest stars until the credits such as Sam Neill or Kathleen Turner.

 Homer's Barbershop Quartet: Bart sees a record from ""The Be Sharps"", a barbershop quartet from 8 years ago. the quartet was made up of: homer, apu, principal skinner, and chief wiggum [ later replaced by Barney Gumble ]

 Cape Feare: Sideshow Bob goes on parole so he can once again attempt to kill Bart, but Bart fools him.

 Homer Goes to College: Homer is forced to go to college because he isn't properly trained to have his job. funny moments in this episode: 1. a pig bites homer after homer keeps playing with the pig's tail. 2. when mr. burns won't let mr. smithers come with him in burn's two-seated escape pod to escape from a nuclear accident, mr. burns says ""i like to put my feet up."" [ if u don't understand this, then watch the episode ]

 Rosebud: Mr. Burns misses his childhood teddy bear, Bobo. Then Bart finds it in a bag of ice from the Kwik-E-Mart, and gives it to Maggie. At the end of the episode, Maggie gives the bear back to Burns.

 Treehouse of Horror: classic episode. Part I: Homer sells his soul for a donut to the Devil, disguised as Ned Flanders. Part II: Bart goes crazy, and thinks there is a gremlin on the side of the school bus. Part III: Mr. Burns is a vampire, and tries to add the Simpsons family to his army of the Undead, making fun of Bram Stroker's Dracula.

 Marge on the Lam: kind of boring. Marge goes on a girl's night out with her neighbor, and finds out the neighbor is a criminal.

 Bart's Inner Child: Homer gets a trampoline, but all the neighborhood kids get hurt on it. Homer and Marge watch a video to help them communicate better. Then the host of the tape comes to Springfield and says everyone should get in touch with their inner child, and they do.

 Boy Scoutz 'N The Hood: not as good as it sounds. Bart and Milhouse get high on a unproperly-made Squishee, and Bart joins the Boy Scouts because he can't think straight. He and Homer go on the father and son river rafting trip, and Homer gets him, Bart, Ned, and i think Todd Flanders stranded. funny moments: when Bart tells Homer about the father son river rafting trip, Homer says ""Hehehe, you don't have a son.""

 The Last Temptation of Homer: Homer gets a beautiful co-worker which has a lot in common with him. Marge fears for her marriage when Homer and Mindy (the co-worker) go on a business trip.

 $pringfield: cool episode. Springfield legalizes gambling, so Mr. Burns builds a casino, and even Bart opens one in his treehouse. Marge also becomes obsessed with gambling.

 Homer the Vigelante: Homer forms a vigelante group to try to catch the Springfield Cat Burglar.

 Bart Gets Famous: Bart sneeks away from the field trip to the Box Factory to Krusty Studios, and becomes Krusty's assistant for a little while. funny moments: Bart wrecks the whole studio while the show is on the air, and all he does is turn around to the audience and say ""I didn't do it.""

 Homer and Apu: Homer gets sick from Apu selling expired meat at the Kwik-E-Mart. As a result, Apu is fired. Then Homer and Apu become friends again, and try to get Apu's job back.

 Lisa Vs. Malibu Stacey: Lisa doesn't like the things the Malibu Stacey doll says, so she goes to the creator of Malibu Stacey to fix the problem and make a new doll. funny moments: Mr. Smithers is the biggest Malibu Stacey doll collector in Springfield. Mr. Smithers's computer desktop has a naked picure of Mr. Burns saying ""Mr. Smithers, you are turning me on"" and things like that.

 Deep Space Homer: Homer goes into space with Buzz Aldrin and another astronaut.

 Homer Loves Flanders: Flanders wins tickets to a football game, and takes Homer with him. They become friends, but then Flanders starts to get sick of Homer.

 Bart Gets an Elephant: Basically, Bart wins an elephant in a radio giveaway, but it causes problems, so they give it to a animal refuge.

 Burns's Heir: Mr. Burns decides he should find an heir (besides Smithers, because Burns said when he dies, Smithers will be buried alive with him). He picks Bart, but at the end, Bart decides to go back to his family.

 Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baaadaaaaa$$$$$$$$$ Song: Bart's dog get loose in school, and Skinner loses his job as principal because of it. Flanders replaces him, but at the end, Skinner gets his job back because Flanders used the P.A. system for a prayer.

 The Boy Who Knew Too Much: Bart skips school and witnesses an accident where a waiter is almost killed, and when a man is accused of beating him, Bart knows what really happened, and doesn't know if he should testify because if he did, he would also be admitting to principal Skinner that he skipped school.

 Lady Bouvier's Lover: Marge's mom is wooed by Homer's dad and Mr. Burns. she almost marries Burns, but then she decides to run off with Homer's dad.

 Secrets of a Successful Marriage: Homer teaches an adult class about the secrets of a successful marriage, while also telling secrets about him and Marge. Marge gets so mad they almost split up, but they forgive each other at the end.

1010093,5,6305320098,"I still watch The Simpsons, looking forward to each episode as a new treasure. However, to my mind, the series will never get any better than Season 5. As with the first three James Bond films, there have been great moments since this pinnacle, but it was never better than this. Season 5 of The Simpsons is not only the funniest and best season of this show, it's one of the best seasons of comedy -- live action or animated -- ever seen. A few of my favorites from this great set:

Homer's Barbershop Quartet: Homer tells Bart and Lisa about the time he hit it big with a barbershop quartet with Apu, Principal Skinner and Barney (who replaces Chief Wiggum). Although the music is barbershop, the show is a hilarious send-up of the Beatles. From their Meet the Beatles-style debut album cover to screaming fans at JFK Airport to Barney's ""Japanese conceptual artist girlfriend"" to the climactic rooftop concert on top of Moe's, the episode hits every note perfectly. For good measure, the late George Harrison has a hilarious cameo. ""I'll take a single plum, floating in perfume, served in a man's hat ...""

Deep Space Homer: The Right Stuff, Star Trek, Star Wars, 2001, Outland -- if it's a space drama, this episode spoofs it. Homer gets the chance to go into space as NASA's first ""Averagenaut"" -- an astronaut who appeals to the commone blue collar slob. Naturally, Homer messes everything up and the capsule ends up with dirt, ants and ruffled potato chips flying all over. Homer actually manages to morph into Popeye AND Richard Nixon in this episode. Voice cameos include Buzz Aldrin and James Taylor.

Homer Loves Flanders: Flanders offers Homer a ticket to a sold-out NFL game. In return, Homer drops his hatred of Flanders and becomes his best friend -- much to the chagrin of Flanders as Homer smothers him, driving Ned to the brink of mass murder. In the best Simpsons tradition, a hilarious reference to Terminator 2 comes out of nowhere. It's great to see Homer get under Flanders' skin for a change.

The Last Temptation of Homer: Michelle Pfeiffer guest voices as Mindy Simmons, a female technician Mr. Burns is forced to hire by the government. Slovenly, lazy, donut addicted, Mindy is basically a curvaceous, sexy female version of Homer. Naturally, Homer falls in love with her. This is my favorite Simpsons episode of all time. Werner Klemperer voices Homer's guardian angel in the form of his Hogan's Heroes character Colonel Klink. This episode absolutely had me when Pfeiffer utters the phrase ""Mmmmmmmmmm!! Double glaze!! 'Gurgle!!'"" Gaspingly hilarious!

Those are just four episodes of a nearly perfect season. There have been many, many laughs since then, but Season 5 will always be special to me. If anyone is mystified as to why the show has lasted 17 seasons (and counting), they need only watch Season 5 to find out why. A classic.",1129680000,,2865,4.803245436105477

1010113,5,6305320098,"The Simpsons Season Five DVD is a must for a true Simpsons' fan.  True, this was the first season to feature a couple of duds (Secrets of a Successful Marriage, Bart's Inner Child).  And the groundwork for the series' descent to mediocrity -- too many guest stars, too much maudlin drama and too much focus on secondary characters -- was being laid.  And I believe it was Season Five that saw the origin of the series' most horrible catch-phrase -- ""Whaaa-aaah?""  Plus, we see the first musical.  The episode (Barbershop Quartet) is great but the groundwork it laid would lead to some of the worst episodes in the Series.

But that's the later years.  Season Five itself featured some of the best episodes of the Series.  Sideshow Bob's hysterical return in ""Cape Feare"" (I fall into the pro-rakes camp).  The final give in to parody rather than homage of Citizen Kane in ""Rosebud"".  One of the best all-time Simpsons' sees Averagenaut Homer Simpson wrestling with Buzz Aldrin (Deep Space Homer).  And Apu's misunderstood apology to Homer still kills me.

The show was firing on all cylinders at this point.  Homer still had the right balance of being boorish and selfish (see Boy Scoutz N The Hood) but didn't go overboard the way he did in later seasons.  Flanders is still annoyingly nice.  Lisa is still  the nicest person on the show, but hasn't gone overboard to obnoxious self-righteousness.  Marge still has her role as straight man down without the ridiculous hysteria of later seasons.  And the Series still had, as Groening says, the rubber band reality.

And for those of you who are saying, ""Hey man, I can catch these on TV anytime!"", you don't know what you're missing.  Some of the funniest gags are cut in syndication -- typically two minutes per show.  And broadcast is never as pristine as the DVD (although some episodes have a small but annoying green line on the side in a widescreen TV).

The extra are nice.  Plenty of deleted scenes (although you have to click an icon during the show instead of having them separate).  Good commentaries for the most part although I missed Al Jean later in the season and I wish they had involved the cast like they did for the wonderful Season Three commentaries.  Matt Groening also sits out a couple of commentaries and his presence is sorely missed.

But don't hesitate to order this.  It's hard to find more entertainment for $30.",1127347200,3,2394,4.719806763285024
1010114,5,6305320098,"Possibly the funniest animated lunacy to ever be seen can be seen here on the fifth season of the Simpsons.  Practically every episode collected in this handsome set is an all time classic; case in point the insanely funny ""Rosebud"" in which the evil Mr. Burns yearns to be re-united with his stuffed teddy bear Bobo, which has fallen into the hands of baby Maggie.  The scene in which Smithers dresses up like Bobo in an attempt to ""cheer-up"" Mr. Burns is by far one of the funniest things you'll ever see.  ""Homer and Apu"" is another classic episode in which Homer is responsible for Apu getting fired from the Kwik-E-Mart, so Homer lets him move in.  Hilarity and singing and dancing ensue.  ""Deep Space Homer"" is yet another classic in which Homer ends up becoming an astronaut, well, kind of.  Anyway, he goes into space, along with a bag of chips and some ants.  You know what happens next.  One could go on and on about the other episodes here, such as ""Cape Feare"" in which Sideshow Bob (Kelsey Grammer) returns hilariously spoofing Martin Scorsese's remake of the classic thriller, and the season finale in which Homer's new job nearly costs him his marriage, but if you're a long time viewer of the long running show, you already know what's here, and you already know that this is absolutely the finest animated hilarity money can buy.",1127174400,3,1346,4.649789029535865

Some of my favorite parts of this year were the Sideshow Bob episode ""Cape Feare"", which is probably my all-time favorite Sideshow Bob episode (I don't think that any of them are bad, but they started to go downhill after the one with David Hyde Pierce, which is my second-favorite).  We learn of Homer's old barbershop quartet, Mr. Burns' old teddy bear, Bobo, Marge's gambling problems, and the appeal of the phrase, ""I didn't do it"".

The menus on the DVDs are also really great, maybe the best so far, they really put a lot of work in this feature (I didn't see any other DVD with such a great animation in the menu). That shows that the people working in delivering this DVDs (I don't know if it's The Simpsons creators or FOX) worries about delivering a product of great quality.

Well, since you maybe want to buy this product I started talking about the presentation of the DVD, but the fun part are the contents. The majority of the episodes have deleted scenes, and almost everyone comes with comentaries (I never listen to that anyway). It has some extras, not a lot really, but every disc has something (you shouldn't buy it only for the extras anyway).

The season is one of the best ones ever... one episode greater than the oder, this season has bits that i've will never forget (like, ""Hello Mr. Thompson""). Homer singing with the Be Sharps, going into Space, Bart and his elephant Stampy, Burns and his bear ""Bobo"", Homer being dumped by Marge when he reveals all of her secrets, etc. If you really like the simpsons, you should have this pack in your collection, is the best one yet.

There's something bad anyway, minor if you want, but there is. For some reason when you choose the language it goes directly to the episode, and it does the same thing when you select ""play with deleted scenes"" and also you cannot change the subtitles in midplay (I don't know why, since you can change the language). So, you cannot play the episode with the deleted scenes and also the subtitles... is not to die for, but is annoying.

1010174,4,6305320098,"Perhaps it is a bit unfair to compare any DVD season to the 4th Season of the Simpsons.  For me, the 4th season is the greatest season in the show, and the greatest DVD box set ever produced for a television series.  However, since it does exist, I have to give season 5 a lower grade, so it rates 4/5.  There are many highlights to the season, but there is an unfortunate discontinuity about the middle of the season.  There was a large writer turnover between Seasons 4 and 5, and the quality of shows in the last half of Season 5 (and the first half of Season 6) reflect it.  Where the first half of this season (and all of Season 4) is wall-to-wall brilliance, the second half of season 5 contains such unmemorable episodes as ""Bart Gets an Elephant,"" ""The Boy Who Knew Too Much,"" and ""Bart Gets Famous.""  (all Bart episodes, I notice! - I also didn't like ""Bart's Inner Child"")

However, the first half of the season does contain some of the greatest episodes in the series, and indeed, my all-time favourite moment in the entire history of the Simpsons: Homer choosing to chase squirrels instead of attending a free help session in ""Homer Goes to College.""  That this scene is routinely cut from the syndicated version of the show is proof of the necessity of buying the Simpsons DVD's.  Not to mention that we can watch them all commercial-free and get to listen to the amusing and occasionally insightful commentary tracks on every single episode.  As Mr. Burns might say, the Simpsons DVD's are ""excellent.""

Highlights of Season 5:

1. Homer's Barbershop Quartet: a surprisingly adept Barney leads Homer, Apu, and Principal Skinner to a Grammy award.  Features the late, great George Harrison helping Homer find some brownies.

2. Cape Feare (aka The Thompsons): Bart and family go into the Witness Protection Program as Side Show Bob is released from prison and vows revenge.  Features Bob's immortal performance of the entire soundtrack for ""HMS Pinafore.""

3. The Last Temptation of Homer: Michelle Pfeiffer is sexy and disturbingly familiar as the first female plant worker who develops a crush on Homer.

4. $pringfield: Marge becomes addicted to gambling and neglects her duties as a mother, forcing Lisa to wear a Homer-built costume in the school play.

5. Homer the Vigilante: Homer vows to get back Lisa's saxophone from the catburgler that stole it.  Featuring a fantastic homage to ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World.""

6. Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy: After Lisa discovers that her talking Malibu Stacy has only chauvenistically banal things to say, she enlists the doll's creator (brilliantly voiced by Kathleen Turner) in the creation of a new doll.

7. Deep Space Homer: NASA, trying to increase its ratings, enlists Homer and Barney in a competition to find the first ""everyman"" astronaut to fly in the space shuttle, piloted by Buzz Aldrin.

8. Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song: Principal Skinner gets fired (replaced by Ned Flanders) and re-enlists in the Army.  Featuring the biggest laugh of the season - the shelling of the Apu's newly installed gas pumps by Skinner's training platoon.

As usual, there are commentaries on every episode, and a great number of cut scenes (many collected together in a special feature with commentary).  Some we have already seen (like the robotic Richard Simmons) in Season 7's ""138th Show Spectacular,"" but many we haven't, and they are placed within the episodes so they can be seen in context of where they would have played had they been kept in the show.",1122076800,,3520,4.826666666666667

1. Important parts of the show are cut in reruns so you may miss some of the most hilarious parts of the show!  This is one of the worst aspects of the repeats (Not that it ever keeps me from watching them).  If you did not see the original Simpsons air, you may never have seen some of these cut scenes.  I hadn't.  I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that although when the show came out I was a fan, (I was about fourteen at the time, and when I was even younger I was a fan of them on Tracey Ullman), I became a fanatic fan later.

 So, being busy with highschool and college, I didn't necessarily watch it to the faithful degree I do now that I have real responsibilities.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that my husband is equally enamoured of the series.  Some of these cut scenes were so funny we couldn't believe we'd never gotten to see them. And there's one nearly every episode.  There's even never aired before scenes!  This is more true I think of the 5th seasons than all the previous ones.  The Simpsons writers, according to those on the commentaries, had to cut the length of the show to fit in more commercial time (very annoying!) and so when we buy the ""complete 16th season"" (and you know we will!) there won't be the same opportunity to see non-mangled original episodes, because they are now so short they don't have to be mangled.  (very sad, isn't it?)

2. I really enjoy the commentaries. I almost never listen to director's commentaries on movies, because if you've just seen the movie it gets too boring, unless it's a favorite.  But these commentaries are so funny and so short that you will really enjoy listening to them.  You will hear stories such as how the writers met Michelle Pfeiffer (she was Mindy), and other famous guest stars like Kathleen Turner.

3. This is the season where Marge joins the police force, (and becomes Homer's little piglet), and the season where Homer loves Flanders!  You can't go wrong.",1116547200,7,2120,4.431524547803617
1010241,5,6305320098,"It goes without saying that The Simpsons is great, and there are plenty of customer reviews describing each episode (which you have seen plenty of times in syndication if you are the kind of person thinking to buy this) so I won't go into those aspects.

If you are thinking about IF you should buy this set, or WHICH Simpsons DVD set to buy, buy this one, do it!  This is a great DVD set, the best of the 5 yet, really good easy to navigate menus, a play all function (first two didn't have this,) fun menus, a lot of extras.  What more do you need to know?

I hope that was helpful. If not then maybe you want to know more about episode info, so then you should read a different review.  Great reasons to buy this DVD set besides the obvious fact that the Simpsons is awesome.

Now, my only gripe with this Simpsons set.

Casual consumers: Please stop reading and move on.
Fellow Geeks and commentary buffs:

One of my favorite things about the entire DVD collection is the commentary by the writers, producers, and now actors.  (The commentary is a huge redeeming factor for season 1, which would otherwise go unwatched in my household.)

The season 5 commentary is the worst of all 5 seasons thus far, and there are only two words to describe why: David Mirkin.  If you enjoy hearing why jokes are written, or where they get ideas,  funny stories from the set, or little tid-bits about nuances in shots, then you will be sorely disappointed.  David Mirkin takes it upon himself to focus solely on the actors and their abilities to do multiple voices in every single episode.  He takes 30 seconds to start every sentence the same way he started the one before, and it is unfortuneate because as the seasons go on the shorter the episodes become and David Mirkin is taking up valueable commentary time.

David Mirkin,  we know the actors are great, that's WHY we bought the DVD set, we don't need to hear it over and over again.  Please let others get a word in edgewise.",1116201600,2,1973,4.436111111111111

1010243,2,6305320098,"First off, the Simpsons is probably the best show ever made. But I would have to rate this season as probably the weakest so far. Starting in the middle of season 4, specifically with Marge vs the Monorail, something changed. It's hard to put my finger on it, but the show somehow became sterile, stagnant.

I think the whole problem is the characters. The show became more about the jokes than the characters themselves. To this day I can still watch seasons 1-3, and even though I still know the episodes almost by heart, they are still entertaining because the characters are so rich, so amusing to watch.

For example, the early Homer was funny because he was a manchild. He took pleasure from the simple things, got mad for almost no reason, and uttered simple thoughts. Then for about 2 years he became somewhat of a speech giver, almost like a slow witted philosopher. Gone were the vacant but smiling stare and 5 word sentences. If you don't know what I'm talking about, watch the early episode where Homer buys Lisa a horse. In the scene where Marge tries to talk him out of it, he gets out the argument by pretending to agree, using fake affirmations like 'ba'. When Marge finally gives up, the lights go out, and all we see is the white eyeballs and a giant tooth filled grin. I know what they're going to say, I even know what that grin looks like, and it's still very funny to watch. I don't know of too many scenes like that in season 5.

Now I know they wanted to expand the characters a little bit, and I think they succeeded eventually. But for about 2 seasons The Simpsons looked like they had run their course. It's interesting in that most shows I have watched, when the show starts to get bad, it continues to stagnate until they finally pull the plug on it. The Simpsons is different, it seems to go in cycles. I was just about ready to give up on it recently, here in season 15, but it looks like it's starting to show some signs of life again after 3+ mediocre seasons.",1115942400,2,1993,4.3956639566395665

1010247,5,6305320098,"Originally a spin-off from a one-minute segment of The Tracy Ullman Show, The Simpsons morphed into the then-burgeoning FOX network's most successful program. As the longest running animated television show in history, and the longest running prime show of any type, The Simpsons is an American treasure - a combination of humor, wit, and satire that examines not just the lives of its eccentric characters, but also the society, culture, and world in which we live. Fun for adults and children alike, The Simpsons is a cutting edge television comedy that, like Seinfeld, changed the television landscape in the 1990's by creating a new genre of TV fun - spawning large network investments in new series such as King of the Hill, Futurama, and The Family Guy.

Like all new things which smash the paradigm of life, The Simpsons is unrivaled by its knockoffs, and the show doesn't show signs of slowing down. If you haven't yet visited Springfield, then I definitely recommend that you pick up The Simpsons DVD (Season 1) to catch a glimpse for yourself. You have no idea what you've been missing...

The Simpsons (Season 5) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Homer's Barbershop Quartet"" in which Homer tells Bart and Lisa the story of his early brush with fame as a member of ""The Be Sharps"" - a barbershop quartet composed of Homer, Principal Skinner, Apu, and Barney (who replaced Chief Wiggum at the request of a music rep). The Be Sharps take the world by storm, performing for President Reagan and Johnny Carson. Eventually, the band is destroyed by Homer's bad song writing and Barney's new Asian girlfriend... Other notable episodes from Season 5 include ""Rosebud"" (a satire of Citizen Kane, but with Mr. Burns in the starring role) and ""Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"" in which Lisa protests the stereotypical and sexists remarks made by a talking Malibu Stacy doll (her efforts eventually lead to a new product design which bombs in the marketplace)...

1010248,5,6305320098,"I was especially excited about season 5 coming out on DVD.  The David Mirkin era (seasons 5 and 6) is my personal favorite among the show's history, although I know not all fans agree with me.  The series changed in tone during this time, largely due to show-runner Mirkin's personality and writing style.  When Al Jean and Mike Reiss ran seasons 3 and 4, they produced high quality stories that were relatively plausible and down-to-earth.  Mirkin was (and still is) respectful of what had been established during those seasons, but he took the show to a new level by exploring the characters more deeply and by not shying away from broader stories and wackier jokes.  Mirkin also has a very sarcastic and cynical sense of humor, which is apparent in the episodes he worked on, as well as in the commentaries.  Season 5 contains some of the jokiest episodes that push boundaries that hadn't been pushed before that point, and many of them are my personal favorites in the series for that reason.  These include ""$pringfield"", ""Homer Goes To College"", ""Boy Scoutz 'N the Hood"", ""The Last Temptation of Homer"", ""Homer and Apu"", ""Deep Space Homer"", ""Burns' Heir"", and ""Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song"".  Actually, I love all the episodes on this DVD, but those are some of the more memorable ones for me.

The DVD presentation is excellent, with clever animated menus, Easter eggs, and an improved collection of Bonus Extras.  Each disk contains an animatic, and two of them feature a highly entertaining ""illustrated commentary"" by Wes Archer and David Silverman (the other two have regular commentaries by Silverman and some animators).  There are lots of deleted scenes included on the DVD, which can be played within the episodes, or back-to-back as a separate feature on disk 4.

The commentaries are fun, as unsual, with Matt Groening, David Silverman, and David Mirkin on almost all of them, along with writers, directors, a few of the actors, and Jim Brooks on some of them.  I was disappointed that a few directors (particularly Jeff Lynch and Jim Reardon) and some writers were unavailable to do commentaries this year, but the rest of the commentators picked up the slack well.  Mirkin has a tendency to over-explain things, but at least he has a pleasant speaking voice and he's a funny guy.  Also, this DVD features Conan O'Brien's final commentaries, and he is always a delight.

Overall, this DVD set is a gem.  My one minor complaint is that turning on the subtitles was a bit more cumbersome than on previous DVD sets.  Other than that, the season 5 DVD set is the best yet.  Bring on season 6!",1113091200,6,2617,4.814317673378076
1010279,3,6305320098,"Half the reason I buy the Simpson DVD's is to listen to the audio commentaries. Seasons 1-4 always had Mike Riess and Al Jean on them, basically running the commentary part, with Matt Groening and a guest along for the ride. But since they were not actively involved with Season 5, they aren't on there, which is disappointing. We had a nice historical continuity thing going and now the new guys on there apparently haven't listened to the Mike and Al commentaries, so they are saying things like ""was this the first time this carachter was on"" and of course we, the people who buy the DVD's no it isn't.

1010282,4,6305320098,"There's something a bit different about the 5th Season's graphics, plots, and the bonus extras  that  Simpson fans might find irritating (not my remarks; the techniques).

The graphics and color are rendered with an intensity that may disappoint those diehards, such as I,  who like the less well-defined images of the earlier seasons. In Season 5,  the color has a real Technicolor feel about it as opposed to the cheaper (but memorable) process of Hollywood in the mid-1940's where the producer, Ross Hunter, gussied up his romantic stories  with a technique known as Pathe. Furthermore, there is sense that the producers and directors have really aimed toward high technical virtuosity and have, in fact, succeeded to the detriment of plot and story line. In previous Seasons,  humor was mixed with melancholy and a pointed existential flair, but in  Season 5 I sensed  a zany three-stooges farcical thread. Additionally, there's quite a bit of profanity in  5; nothing to worry about  for kids of any age, but a noticeable shift, I felt. Finally, the Bonus stuff isn't  as complete  or as well thought out  as I'd  wish to see. The section on animaniacs could be of interest to some Graphic artists, but  was  lost to me, and I don't really learn much when the producer, director, and writer are discussing an episode, but there is  sometimes little  connection between their  words  and  the frames shown on the screen.

The Simpsons' started with season 4, peaked at season 5, and slowly trailed off in 6 and 7.  Buy it, love it, live it!  Homer for president!",1107993600,2,556,4.5

1010340,3,6305320098,"Considering that most of these sets offer the same kinds of extras, the rating has to reflect the quality of the episodes themselves.

And, unfortunately, after reaching new heights of excellence with ""Marge vs. the Monorail"" and ""A Streetcar Named Marge"" in season 4 and peaking with arguably the most intellectually hilarious 30 seconds in television history (""Worker and Parasite"" in ""Krusty gets Kancelled""), the first signs of what has become a long, slow decline of ""The Simpsons"" begins in Season 5.

This isn't to say there weren't some misses in previous seasons, but even the less-than-stellar episodes generated at least a few laughs. And this isn't to say that ""The Simpsons"" has jumped the shark (although it has come close at times); even its worst episodes are better than nearly all of the other ""Raymonds,"" ""Jims"" and ""Joeys"" that pass for TV comedy today combined.

But what even the most rabid Simpsons fan has to admit is that Season 5 is the first season where episodes that are truly unfunny from beginning to end appear. ""Marge on the Lam"" is a monotonous take on ""Thelma and Louise"" that goes absolutely nowhere. ""Bart Gets an Elephant"" is a one-joke piece that begins a seemingly endless series of ""funny pet"" episodes that appear with distressing predictability in future seasons. ""Bart Gets Famous"" is quite possibly the worse episode ever--a totally unfunny exercise in self-absorption that blooms into the endless series of reflexive Fox jokes in season 6. ""Homes Goes to College"" begins a terrible trend of Homer-as-frat-boy plots, and ""Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy"" maligns little Lisa with a plot unworthy of her intelligence.

Season 5 also begins the regrettable tendency to replace genuine laughs from witty writing and situations with cheap laughs from cutaway visual gags and one-liners. It's a shopworn practice as old as cartoons themselves, and one that The Simpsons managed to largely resist until Season 5, where it became a patented fall-back mechanism and remains so today.

Most distressing is the total transformation of Homer from a slow yet caring father-cum-working class hero into a completely one-dimensional neanderthal. Whether this was a directive from Fox or a conscious decision by Groenig and co., it started the series on a long downward slide into predictability and shameless pandering to contemporary music and MTV culture.

So what earns this collection its 3 stars? The few stellar episodes like ""Cape Feare,"" ""Deep Space Homer,"" ""Homer and Apu"" and ""The Devil and Ned Flanders"" vignette from ""Treehouse of Horror."" None of these episodes matches the sheer combination of wit and scathing satire as the pantheon episodes, but they at least are funny. That can't be said for the clunkers in season 5, nearly all of season 6, and, these days, at least 50% of all episodes from season 5 on. If you haven't seen these episodes, the collection is worth it (although seasons 1-4 truly comprise the Golden Age of the series) for the diamonds in the rough. For those who have seen it, it's the last ""must have"" Simpsons collection; everything from this point forward is for diehard fans only.",1107216000,22,3140,5.040462427745664

Tree House of Horror 4 with Homer selling his soul for donuts and Mr. Burns as a vampire who bites Bart.

""Homer the Vigilante"" Homer becomes the leader of the neighborhood watch to find a cat burglar and becomes power hungry, beating uncooperative people with sacks of doorknobs.

""Bart Gets Famous""  Bart becomes Krusty the clowns assistant and eventually gets put on the show where he comes up with the catchphrase ""I didn't do it"" which the audience loves.  He eventually appears on the Conan O' Brien show.

""Deep Space Homer""  Homer is chose by NASA to be an everyday guy to go on a space mission.  Of course Homer ends up screwing up and endangering the mission.  Guess stars astronaut Buzz Aldrin.

""Burns' Heir""  Since Monty Burns has no heir he decides to hold open auditions for the local children.  Bart is turned down and then vandalizes Burn's mansion in revenge.  This impresses Burns and he makes Bart his Heir.

""Homer Goes to College"" Home fails a competancy test at work and is forced to go back to college in order to keep his job.  The Dean provides three nerds to tutor Homer and he teaches them all about partying and pulling pranks on the rival school which gets the nerds expelled!

Those are my favorites but this is a nop notch season all the way around with plenty of guest voices as usual.  There's commentary on all the episodes along with deleted scenes, galleries, etc.  Another outstanding Simpsons set!",1106092800,,2297,4.649122807017544

1010400,4,6305320098,"While season 5 is a must buy for fans of the show,and it counts some classic episodes among its ranks,this was the first season that indicated the show was getting a little stale,in my opinion. The glib celebrity special appearances became more frequent,and made less sense,the storylines became more over the top,and the characters seemed more like run of the mill cartoons rather than the more humanistic people they were in the sterling seasons 2-4. In short,season 5 was when The Simpsons started to become caricatures of themselves.

Even so,there's still a lot to like here,and I especially like the way they've handled the menus,etc. I wish every season could have been done this way. If you're a fan,you probably already have this,and all of the earlier seasons,but I would recommend seasons 3 or 4 first for more casual viewers.",1105401600,6,837,4.978571428571429

The take-no-prisoners blowpoke-to-the-head humor of South Park is its own reward quite apart from Homer Marge Bart Lisa Maggie & Company - rather than an Instead Of - but Fambly Guy, which impresses me [or rather DOESN'T] as a pathetic mishmash of The Flintstones, The Simpsons and Married With Children, only wishes it had the meat of even one of those shows on its rickety bones.  We certainly won't be seeing 16 seasons of THAT!  I'll take even the least of The Simpsons [the current season] over FG's longwinded ""humor"" any day.  I too wish that the remainder of The Simpsons would be issued in a less spaced-out fashion, but the extras that are included are worth a little time lag.  I'll just continue to wait [im]patiently for the rest of these, collect The Flintstones, South Park and Married With Children along the way, and keep a chilled bottle ready for the day when Fambly Guy goes down on its anemic face and stays there.

1010403,5,6305320098,"As I've made my way through the first five seasons on DVD, it is amazing how each season (at least up to this point) is better than the previous one.  I didn't think Season Four could be topped until watching this latest DVD set.  In this season, plot strands are often unresolved in service of wonderful jokes, references or parodies.  In this season, The Simpsons become even more aware, within the confines of their animated series, of their place in popular culture, of their intersections with it, their complicity with it, and they totally revel in it.  The most noteworthy things about this season are the increased usage of Montgomery Burns, who, in my opinion is the funniest character in the show, and the complete Neaderthalization of Homer Simpson (as noted by Conan O'Brien in one of the commentary tracks).  So many of these shows were memorable, so if pressed, here are my picks for best episodes from each disc--

Disc One:  Homer Goes to College (with apologies to Rosebud)

Disc Two: Homer the Vigilante

Disc Three: Bart Gets Famous (with apologies to Homer Loves Flanders)

Disc Four: Burn's Heir

The commentaries are, as usual, ""Exxxxxcelllllennnt.""  Recommended for anybody interested in great television.",1104624000,7,1228,4.995073891625616
1010404,5,6305320098,"Ah, the Simpsons... the longest lasting, funniest, and greatest show on TV. Season 5 is where it all began. THIS is where the change from crudely drawn characters learning important morals to actual humor took place. Now, I'm not saying the old episodes were dull and crappy... wait, that's exactly what I'm saying... especially when compared to seasons 5 and up (Not so much after 9).

This is one of the ""Best-seasons-EVER"" and features guest stars, gags, and... uh... gum(?) galore. I would buy this season simply because it has Bart singing the classic MC Hammer tune, much less every other episode and bonus feature. It's a little pricey, but I highly recommend this box set.",1104537600,,680,4.862068965517241
1010405,5,6305320098,"Long before the fifth season, the creators of the Simpsons had perfected the show as the most well-written and subversive series in TV history. This season, the storylines get a little sentimental, with truly cracked feats of the imagination really blowing up in the sixth season, which is my personal favorite (I hope it's less than a year before that DVD set comes out). In this fifth season the values of family and friendship come to the fore, though always in that deep and intelligent Simpsons style. Examples include how the evil Mr. Burns connects with his past with Maggie's help in the satirical ""Rosebud,"" Flanders expands his range of emotion and friendship in ""Homer Loves Flanders,"" Homer reaffirms his marriage in ""The Last Temptation of Homer,"" and Grampa nearly finds a new love in ""Lady Bouvier's Lover."" Episodes like these are still hysterical in the details, of course, though the settings and situations were becoming more heartfelt. This shows that the Simpsons writers and producers were truly devoted to long-term character development this season, a concept that has sadly fallen by the wayside in more recent years.

However, on the less sentimental and more subversive side, this season still contains some stone cold classics of intricate comedy writing. This goes especially for one of the all-time greats, ""Cape Feare"" in which Kelsey Grammer reaches his highest heights of criminal insanity with the voice of Sideshow Bob. This episode makes the whole season. Another classic is ""The Boy Who Knew Too Much"" which is one of the funniest episodes ever, plus we can't forget the beginning of the running blood feud between Maggie and the as-yet-unnamed Gerald, which has never been fully resolved. The best social commentary this season comes in ""Bart Gets Famous,"" which lampoons the worldwide success of the Simpsons from within the show; and ""Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song"" which sneakily tackles the military and church vs. state. While the action and outright hysterics slowed down a little this year, the writing was reaching even greater depths of intricacy and emotion. That makes the fifth season of the Simpsons the most sensitive of the series. [~doomsdayer520~]",1104451200,6,2206,5.162011173184357

Many fans will say this is the season that hits on all cylinders & is arguably the best season of all, and I really can't dispute it (although personally, I say it's a 3-way tie for season 3, 4, and 5). Of course the episodes are great, but the commentaries are (once again) nicely done as well. One speaker of note is Conan O'Brien, who appears on the commentaries for three episodes...he never fails to break up the room with laughter, yet to his credit he suprisingly keeps on-topic for the most part. There's a few tweaks here & there for the better, such as being able to view a deleted scene during the spot in the episode it was originally intended for...just click on an icon when prompted, and voila!

The actual DVDs they've certainly improved upon.  No painful pauses once you choose an option and the extras are fan-friggin-tastic compared to the last 4.  They've got full moving episodes of the drawings for one.  Even the menu screen entertainment is unique and... entertaining!  The little episode booklet you get looks just like their paperback episode book (inside, not out), so it's a little funner.

The one thing I'd like to BEG the DVD people:  Put the episode list ON THE DISKS!!!  You always have to pull out that booklet to figure out what's where.

If you don't have any of the DVD sets, I'd start with this one.  There's a lot more movie references, etc here.  It's just funnier all around.

Most of the episodes in Season 5 still resound with huge amounts of fresh, dense and incisive wit, and even the few weaker episodes are pretty good and have enough enjoyable humor in them to be worth seeing again.

Now, if only Fox would include the FULL SET of shorts from the Tracy Ullman shows on one of these DVD sets. That is the special feature many fans have long been awaiting. In the meantime, enjoy what's here because it's terrific.

When it comes to the truly classic seasons of the show (seasons 3-8), it is very hard to pick a favorite season. The excellent writing and constant laughs that these years brought us makes each one of those seasons fantastic. But the reason I feel that season five is one of the best, if not the best season of the whole show, is because it offers the most consistency in terms of the laughs that it brings and the biggest collection of truly great episodes.

A few episodes worth mentioning are ""Cape Feare"" which puts a hilarious spin on the film of the same name in which Sideshow Bob comes after Bart once again; ""Homer Goes to College"" in which Homer fails a competency test at work and must go back to college to keep his job; ""Rosebud"" which puts a hilarious spin on the movie ""Citizen Kane"" in which Mr. Burns searches for his long lost teddy bear Bobo; ""Tree House of Horror IV"" in which we get to see Burns as Dracula and Flanders as the Devil; ""$pringfield"" in which Marge is portrayed as a gambling addict; ""Deep Space Homer"" in which NASA wants to select an average everyday loser for their next mission into space and Homer is chosen; and ""Burns' Heir"" in which Mr. Burns takes Bart under his wing and tries to get Bart to love him.

Overall, the fifth season is filled with a vast array of truly great episodes that show The Simpsons at its best. The fantastic writing and constant laughst that this season bring make it a must own for any fan of the show. As usual, the extras are nicely done as well.

I became addicted to the Simpsons in 1989 when I saw their Christmas special which I thought was hysterical! I knew that this show would do good later on. It sure has, on it's sixteenth season is a extremely difficult thing for an animated series to get up to. I like the classic episodes; they are the ones that are more funny in my opinion.

1010565,5,6305320098,"There's no question that the last few seasons to be released on DVD were when the Simpsons really hit their stride. However, to echo another reviewer, these episodes can be seen on TV every day. I suspect the reason it takes so long to release the DVD's  is because FOX has a sweet sindication deal and doesn't want to spoil it by releasing the episodes too soon. Which leaves me in a bind, do I want to pay for material that I've mostly seen already. Hmmmmm.",1101600000,,459,4.337209302325581
1010566,5,6305320098,"Season 1 was choppy at best and the writers were still feeling their way around.  Around Seasons 2 & 3, they realized that the comedy gold was not in Bart but Homer and the show's focus started to switch to him, all the animation got much, much better.  Season 4, you could see the jokes getting sharper and the writers were really mastering their domain.

And in Season 5, it all came together.  Season 5 is definitely the year in which The Simpsons became the funniest show on television.  Some of the best episodes of the entire series are in Season 5 (Homer and Apu, The B-Sharps) and if there is any one season to own of The Simpsons, it's this one.  Also the Treehouse of Horrors start to get better around this season as the previous ones are all pretty lame.  Treehouse of Horror was never that great though but there have been some choice eps (teachers eating students story, Willie the gardner killing students in their sleep, etc.)",1101340800,10,942,4.5058823529411764

1010568,5,6305320098,"Most of you reading this probably already know The Simpsons is the best TV show ever. I think is true not only because I laugh for 22 minutes, but because it is smart humor, especially with this season. In between the first time and the last time I watched ""Homer's Barbershop Quartet"" I became a big Beatles fan, even now I'm catching little jokes there is no way I would have caught a few years ago, and I'm sure I'll catch more on the DVD. On a similar note I watched the movie ""Cape Fear"" after I watched the episode ""Cape Feare"" I loved the episode the first time I watched it, but even more so since I have watched the movie.

I'm sure I'll be able to add to this after the DVD comes out and I watch more movies. If you're watching an older movie it's not hard to hard to find these parodies. You also look pretty smart when you're watching with friends and say ""that was from Citizen Kane.""

Regarding the commentaries, even if you're not a uberdork you should listen to a few. They are actually hilarious (usually), it's best if you put on the subtitles while listening the the commentators comment, trust me on that one.

Season 5 has a special place in my heart, along the 15 others, excluding 11 of course, but I'm going to make it easy for someone to get this for me for Christmas, so I will not buy this December 21, I guess I can wait 4 days. But it is a good investment, you will laugh and laugh for years.

1010569,5,6305320098,"I've seen all these episodes minus one, and I have to say that this is just about the best that The Simpsons has to offer.  It contains such classic moments as Mr. Burns ordering the Rolling Stones killed after hearing a Ramones song, Barney telling David Crosby that he is his hero Not knowing he is a musician, Homer telling Lisa ""that there may be a boogeyman or boogeymen in the house"", and the classic episode where Homer sells his soul for a donut.

""Homer's Barbershop Quartet,"" the riotous Beatles parody episode;

""Cape Feare,"" the best Sideshow Bob episode ever;

""Rosebud,"" the episode that cemented Mr. Burns as one of the series' best and most beloved characters;

""$pringfield,"" the famous casino episode;

""Homer and Apu,"" a great buddy comedy piece;

""Sweet Seymour Skinner's Badasssss Song,"" the landmark 100th episode;

As are Homer And Apu, and Homer Goes To College. 5 was the season where they started to do less saccharine formula stories and delved further into conceptual humor and outrageous absurdity and Homer really became the simple, lovable hedonist we know today.

That sting it delivers to our culture's view of itself is dulled when delivered years and years after the fact. Even the most brilliant comeback to snide remark in high-school, loses much of it's punch when delivered at the 10 year reunion party. Such it is with the Simpson's DVD releases, which unlike series like South Park, are being released years after original broadcast date. I'm a huge fan of the Simpsons (I taped every episode for years and entered them into a database); but even I neglected to buy the last offering. Not only has the humour gone flat somewhat, poking fun of ourselves several year ago, but the series airs 3 times a day on broadcast television, with the bulk of the episodes on the airwaves being several seasons ahead of what's available on DVD. Frankly, they'll either have to release episodes which are only 4 or 5 seasons old, or legalize marijuana, before I'll be interested enough to buy another DVD offering.

There have been great shows since, but this period was consistantly the smartest, funniest, fastest paced era of the Simpsons, and I consider season 5 to be the master piece.  In my opinion, 5 of the top 10 episodes of all time, are in this set.  The Beatles parady set to early 80's Barbershop quartet.  Deep Space Homer's Classic 2001 Homage with the potato chips.  Homer improvising dinner for the kids while Marge is out gambling.  The Animated Open to ""The Tompson"" in Cape Fear.

1010608,5,6305320098,"Seems like Fox Studio is getting faster at pumping these DVDs out.  The fifth season might be where the simpsons jumped the shark pit, but I'll leave that discussion to the ubernerds.  The fifth season includes the following episodes:

Homer's Barbershop Quartet: While looking through old records, the kids discover their dad was in a barbershop quartet.  Guest appearnce by George Harrison.

Cape Feare [sic]: Side show bob is out to kill Bart and the family is put in the witness relocation program.  Includes the famous ""hello Mr. Thompson"" scene.

Homer Goes to College: After a nuclear plant inspection, Homer has to go to college.  The episode is a send up of popular college movies of the 80's (e.g. Revenge of the nerds or animal house).  Homer falls in with the nerd crowd.

Rosebud: In a long turn of events, Mr. Burn's childhood teddy bear ends up in Maggie's hands.  Burns and Homer negotiate for the return of the bear.  Special guests: the Ramones.

Treehouse of Horror IV: Homer sells his soul for a donut, Bart spies a gremlin on the side of the school bus (ala twilight zone), and Homer kills the vampire Mr. Burns (ala Braum Stroker's Dracula).

Marge on the Lam: In a spoof of Thelma and Loise, Marge and her neighbor go on a cross country chase, when her neighbor steals her ex's car.

Bart's inner child: A self-help guru uses Bart as an example of freeing one's inner child.  A ""do what you feel like"" style festival ensues.  Guest stars James Brown.

Boy Scoutz in da Hood: After a sugar binge, Bart and Milhouse find themselves enrolled in the boyscouts.  Hilarity ensues.

The Last Temptation of Homer: When a beautiful woman starts working at the plant, Homer's faithfulness is put to the test.  Guest starring Michelle Pfeiffer.

$pringfield: Mr. Burns opens a casino in Springfield.  Homer works at the casino, while Marge develops a gambling problem.

Homer the Vigilante: A catburglar is loose in Springfield.  Homer forms a watch group (read mob) to catch the thief.

Bart Gets Famous: While working on the Krusty the Klown show, Bart inadvertantly steals Krusty's thunder and has his 15 minutes of fame.  Guest starring Conan O'Brien (who used to write for the show).

Homer and Apu: Homer gets sick after eating rotting meat from the Quickie Mart.  As penance, Apu moves in to be a servant for the Simpsons.  Homer and Apu then try to get Apu's job back.

Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy: Lisa fights back against corporate America's barbi-style image by producing a doll designed to give girls a positive image for themselves.

Deep Space Homer: Homer competes for and wins (by default) a spot on the spaceshuttle.  His incompetence nearly kills them, and then saves the crew.  Stars Buzz Aldrin and James Taylor.

Homer Loves Flanders: Homer sucks up to Flanders when he learns Flanders has football tickets.  His relationship grows with Ned (uncomfortably so for Ned), until Homer realizes that Flanders is a jerk.

Bart gets an Elephant: Through a wacky radio contest, Bart wins an elephant.  Unable to care for it, he is forced to give it up to a wildlife refuge.

Burn's Heir: Bart competes for, and wins a spot as the heir to Burn's fortune.  But he renounces the throne when Burns wants him to fire Homer.

Sweet Seymore Skinner's Baadasssss Song: Bart's hijinks finally get Seymore fired as the school's principle.  He re-enlists in the army.  Bart and Homer try to get him back as principle when Ned Flanders becomes the new school principle.

The Boy Who Knew Too Much: When Bart skips school he witnesses a crime, allegedly committed by the Mayor's brother.  Bart's testimony can clear him, but Seymore will know Bart cut class.  Homer serves on the jury (""I know you can read my thoughts boy...meow meow meow meow..."")

Lady Boivier's Lover: Marge's mom falls for Homer's dad, only to fall for Mr. Burns.

Secrets of a Successful Marriage: Homer teaches class as a marriage counselor, but ends up dishing the dirt on his own marriage.  Marge kicks him out, and Homer is forced to look after himself.",1098835200,198,4036,4.779710144927536

However There are some small things that could be worked on for season 6, like Der Kommissar said in a much earlier review, change how the box set opens, like Futurama or Family, not that folding crap (folding went out with bell bottoms).  And have more commentaries with Dan Castallenetta and all the other cast members, not just writers, music supervisers and directers. But overall, get this box set when it comes out, you won't be disappointed!  That is all. Watch Venture Brothers on Adult Swim at 11:30pm on Adult Swim, or check local listings.  Patrick Warburton is on it (Putty from Seinfeld), it's a funny show (animation).  If you like Family guy and Futurama you will like this.spawn_2008@webtv.net",1098403200,15,1117,4.737113402061856
1010611,5,6305320098,"Let me start by saying that I am so sick of people dogging the Simpsons because they think their last few seasons aren't up to par.  I have seen every episode every televised and love every single one.  Are some stronger then others?  Yes.  Are some not near as funny as others?  Yes.  But they have been coming up with enteraining stories for over 17 years (remember the Tracey Alman(sp.) shorts, which should be on DVD), and have asked for nothing back from you.  You sound like Comic Book Guy.  You think the Simpsons producers owe you?  No.  I will buy every season when it comes out, and I will do it happily becasue I love this bit of classic television.  If you don't like that go and watch some crap like ""Friends"" or ""Joey.""  Shows that never had any reason to be on television, becuase of their complete lack of humor.

With that said, I can't wait for season five to come out.  December can't come fast enough.  I have purchased every other season release and the little extra DVDs and will continue too.  I love them, and I am sure they will only get better from here.",1098316800,14,1080,4.351758793969849
1010612,5,6305320098,"I think Fox Studios is finally got the message from all the fans.  As you can see from the 5th Season release date, the time between season releases is considerably less than all the previous ones (approx. one year). As an avid Simpsons viewer, I am filled with joy at this.  Can't wait for 12/21!  Keep it up, Fox, and don't be afraid to release the seasons even quicker!!",1097452800,5,373,4.3768115942028984
1010644,4,6305320098,"You know, the reason only one Simpsons set has been released per year is because the makers of the show (who are busy making this year's season) have to find time to record the commentaries.  I would rather have 2 Simpsons sets released each year - than 1 with commentaries.  In my opinion - the guys on those commentaries sound rather bored or tired anyways.  But I admit that some of them were cool, and I would like it if they were on the box set.

Some of the episodes on this set include:

""Homer's Barbershop Quartet"" - a flashback episode with Homer, Apu, Skinner, and Chief Wiggum in a barbershop quartet.  Wiggum gets replaced by Barney.

""Cape Feare"" - one of my favorites - in this parody of the Cape Fear movie:  Sideshow Bob returns to try to kill Bart.  The Simpsons leave Springfield to live on a houseboat - and change their names.

""Homer Goes to College"" - like the name says:  Homer goes to college, after causing a meltdown in a simulation van during a test at work.

""Treehouse of Terror IV"" - stories include the devil (in the form of Ned Flanders);  a gremlin on the side of a schoolbus (mirroring a Twilight Zone episode);  and Mr. Burns as Count Dracula.

""Marge on the Lam"" - Marge and her neighbor go on a road trip kind of like the one that Thelma and Louise had.

""Boy-Scoutz N tha Hood"" - After a wild night, due to an extreme sugar rush by an extra-thick Squishy, Bart joins the Junior Campers.  My favorite scene was where Bart has to read a knife safety book.  A line from his book is ""Don't do what Donny Don't does"".

""$pringfield"" - Mr. Burns opens up a casino in Springfield.  Homer becomes a card dealer, and Marge learns that she has a gambling problem.

""Homer the Vigilante"" - the town bans together to catch a cat burglar.  Homer rallies together a group.

""Deep Space Homer"" - Somehow, Homer becomes an astronaut.

""Homer Loves Flanders"" - Homer starts to get along with Ned Flanders, and by doing so -- drives Ned insane.

""Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadassss Song"" - billed as the 100th episode -- after a mishap at the school:  Skinner is fired.

""The Boy Who Knew Too Much"" - Bart skips school, Skinner (sensing that Bart isn't sick) vows to catch him in the act.  Meanwhile, a trial occurs.  Bart can clear the guy's name, but than Skinner would know that Bart had skipped school.

""Secrets of a Successful Marriage"" - Marge throws Homer out of the house.

Bound to a great season, so check it out.  I'm waiting for the ""Who Shot Mr. Burns?"" episodes to be on DVD myself -- the season finale of season six, and the season premiere of season seven.  Enjoy.",1097193600,9,2601,4.419831223628692

Although we have the unpredictable new episodes now, where they could either be good or bad (mostly bad), we can all take soloce in the fact that there will be the DVDs.

Anyway, the golden era continues with the fifth season, which has many great episodes. We've got Homer going into space, Lisa speaking out against Malibu Stacey, Bart becomes Burns' heir, and Marge develops a gambling problem.

1010676,5,6305320098,"I started watching the Simpsons when I was about 7-8 years old. Then I stopped watching it, and just recently have I got back into the craze for the show. What I don't get is all the DVD sets they have out now are from around the time I was born, and why is it they can't put the seasons straight out on DVD once the season is already been aired. Sorta like the Sopranos series. But not matter what, I am a dedicated Simpsons fan who owns all four seasons. May God Bless Ya",1089676800,,473,3.9894736842105263

I appreciate all the thought and work they put into the releases.  The commentaries are all very interesting, as are the extras relating to the particular seasons.  P.S. those who say the show has been ""slipping"" of late are liars--and not true Simpsons fans at all.  The show has gotten wilder at times but hey, welcome to the 21st century!  I think they've tapped into new levels of creativity.  It's called evolving with the times.  I hope they last for 10 more seasons...at least!",1089590400,,650,4.6

I think as soon as the simpsons stop making new episodes these box sets will be out faster. if any one gets any information about when this DVD set comes out e-mail me.,1088553600,3,316,4.031746031746032
1010679,5,6305320098,"Simpsons Rock! But if they keep releasing 1 set a year with new seasons still in the making, DVDs won't exist anymore by the time the whole collection is available.

1010682,5,6305320098,"I won't go over individual episodes since several people already have, but rest assured - seasons 4-7 were the show's peak. Season 4 firmly established a groove for the series, and season 5 keeps it going with outstanding episodes galore. ""Rosebud"" (where Burns wants his old teddy bear back) is arguably the best Simpsons episode ever, and it is in this set. Other outstanding episodes include ""Burns' Heir"" (Bart gets angry at his family and is adopted by Burns), ""Bart Gets Famous"" (the ""I Didn't Do It"" one), and ""Deep Space Homer"" (Homer joins NASA and goes into space).
If you are new to the DVD sets or (gasp) new to the series, and you can only pick up one season set....well...get season 4, as it is the pinnacle. But as soon as you're done watching that you're going to want more, and that's what season 5 provides.",1086307200,3,825,4.581081081081081

Just brilliant comedy. Amazon selling these for ten bucks a pop is a steal. I could watch the golden years on repeat forever.

1010702,5,6305320098,"The Simpsons DVD sets so far have been jam-packed with extras, commentaries, and creative menu pages, which may be the reason the seasons are fairly slow in coming out.  I am getting a bit antsy because the next 7 seasons or so are so great, but good things come to those who wait. Season five has some of my favorite episodes.  Some were pretty rare to see in syndication and now almost impossible to see as the current reruns seem to concentrate on the later seasons.  Here are my season five highlights:
""Homer's Barbershop Quartet"" with an appearance by George Harrison. This parody of the Beatles is very clever, especially Barney's girlfriend, ""the Japanese conceptual artist.""
""Rosebud"" is in my top 10 Simpsons episodes ever.  Mr. Burns is obsessed with finding his boyhood teddy bear Bobo.  It is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen.  The best part is when Smithers dresses like Bobo to try to, uh, cheer up Burns.
""Bart's Inner Child"": Self-help guru Brad Goodman is impressed by Bart's ""do what you feel like"" attitude.  Springfield puts together a ""Do What You Feel Festival,"" a welcome change from the ""Do As We Say Festival"" (started by German settlers).
""Boy-Scoutz in the Hood"":  Another favorite of mine.  A sugar high causes Bart to join the junior campers, lead by Ned Flanders.  Enduring Homer's constant teasing, Bart dreads telling Homer about the father-son rafting trip (Homers response: ""Ha, you don't have a son."").  Ernest Borgnine guest stars.
""Homer and Apu"": Apu gets busted for selling tainted meat and loses his job at the Kwik-E-Mart.  At one point, Apu and Homer travel to India so Apu can seek forgiveness from the Keik-E-Mart CEO who resides in not the most conveniently located convenience stores.  James Woods guest stars.
""Lisa Vs. Malibu Stacy"":  Lisa is on a rampage when her talking Malibu Stacy doll says things like ""Don't ask me, I'm just a girl.""  She meets with the doll's creator Stacy Lovell to design a more politically correct doll.  Lovell had been forced out of the company because her ideas were not cost effective (oh, and she was also ""funneling profits to the Viet Cong"").  It is hilarious.  Smithers' start-up page on his computer is a must-see.
""Deep Space Homer"": A classic where Homer goes into space.  Buzz Aldrin and James Taylor are guests.
""The Boy Who Knew Too Much"": Bart plays hooky and witnesses an incident that causes a trial against Mayor Quimby's nephew Freddy.  On the jury is Homer ""how many s's are in innocent"" Simpson.
""Secrets of a Successful Marriage"": Homer feels important teaching a class on marriage but Marge is not happy with his ""tell all"" lesson plan.
These are my favorites of this DVD set.  Other episodes include: Cape Feare (starring Springfield's criminal mastermind Sideshow Bob), Homer Goes to College, Treehouse of Horror IV  (where Homer sells his soul for a donut), Marge on the Lam (a Thelma and Louise parody), The Last Temptation of Homer, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized  Gambling, Homer the Vigilante, Bart Gets Famous (Bart as the ""I didn't do it"" boy), Homer Loves Flanders, Bart Gets an Elephant, Burn's Heir, Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song, and Lady Bouvier's Lover (with a parody of The Graduate).",1083974400,261,3237,4.866788321167883
1010703,5,6305320098,"This is without a doubt the BEST SEASON EVER. The most classic, 5 star episodes are on this. The Scriptwriting goes above and beyond the call of duty with awesome work from Swartzwelder, Vitti and O'Brien. No matter how many times you see these episodes you can still watch them over and over again and get new quote-worthy material. Below are the episodes and a brief summary of each.

Cape Feare - Bart begins receiving threatening letters from Sideshow Bob. To protect Bart, the entire Simpson family undergoes Witness Relocation and moves to a houseboat docked on the aptly named Terror Lake.
Homer Goes to College - When it is revealed that Homer is grossly unqualified to be a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, he goes to Springfield University to study nuclear physics.
Rosebud - During a touching birthday slide presentation Smithers makes for Mr. Burns, we see the early life of Springfield's richest man and learn that despite all his power and money, he'll never be whole without Bobo, his favorite childhood teddy bear.
Treehouse of Horror IV - In this year's tricky triptych of terror, Bart presents three Halloween treats based on paintings in the ""Fright Gallery"".
Marge on the Lam - Marge spends some time with her neighbor, Ruth Powers, and the two find that they enjoy each other's company very much. Which, leads to Thelma and Louise proportions.
Bart's Inner Child - Homer and Marge are entranced by a charismatic self-help guru named Brad Goodman. While attending a Brad Goodman seminar with his parents, Bart is asked to appear on stage with the man himself and, as usual, misbehaves.
Boy-Scoutz 'N The Hood - Experimenting with a dangerous all-syrup Squishee, Bart and Milhouse get loopy and run around Springfield singing and having adventures. Waking up with a massive Squishee hangover, Bart remembers that he enlisted in the Junior Campers.
The Last Temptation of Homer - Homer finds he's falling in love with Mindy Simmons, the beautiful new engineer at the plant. Things only get worse when Homer and Mindy are sent to represent the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant at the National Energy Convention in Capital City.
$pringfield - When gambling is legalized in Springfield, Mr. Burns opens an extravagant casino on the boardwalk. Homer is hired as a blackjack dealer despite his counting difficulties and Marge finds herself drawn to the slots.
Homer the Vigilante - A cunning cat burglar named Molloy is robbing Springfield's citizens of their most prized possessions. Homer forms a citizens' watch group that winds up breaking more laws than they protect.
Bart Gets Famous - While working as Krusty the Clown's personal assistant, Bart accidentally steals the limelight when he knocks over a set on live TV and says four magic words: ""I didn't do it"".
Homer and Apu - After Homer eats tainted meat from the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu finds himself out of a job. As an apology to Homer, Apu moves in with the Simpsons and becomes their personal chef and valet.
Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy - After years of loving her Malibu Stacy doll, it begins to dawn on Lisa that her favorite toy sets a bad example for little girls. So, she begins to make a doll of her own.
Deep Space Homer - Homer and Barney are recruited to be NASA astronauts, so the organization will be more appealing to the common man.
Homer Loves Flanders - When Homer discovers that Ned Flanders has season football tickets, the two men begin spending a lot of time together. Homer takes a real liking to Ned, but Ned isn't so sure how he feels about his new best friend.
Bart Gets an Elephant - Bart wins first prize in a wacky radio contest and becomes the proud owner of a giant elephant he names Stampy.
Burns' Heir - Well into his eighth or ninth decade, Monty Burns realizes that he has no children and therefore no heir for his vast fortune. After an audition process in which every child in Springfield vies for the coveted position as Burns' kid.
Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song - Principal Skinner must learn to live without his beloved elementary school when Bart gets him fired. Ned Flanders is brought in to act as principal in Skinner's place.
The Boy Who Knew Too Much - In a case ripped right out of the headlines, Bart is the only witness when Mayor Quimby's ne'er-do-well nephew, Freddy, allegedly assaults a snooty French butler.
Lady Bouvier's Lover - Having already fallen hard for Marge, Mr. Burns now finds himself smitten with Marge's mother, Jacqueline Bouvier. Competing for the old lady's affection is Grandpa Simpson, who also thinks that she's the bee's arthritic knees.
Secrets of A Successful Marriage - Somehow Homer comes to teach an adult education class on how to have a successful marriage. Even stranger, he turns out to be pretty good at it, dispensing homespun advice that his students find useful. Although, in the end, he dispenses too much.
EXTRAS - We can always expect the great commentary, animatics, audio outtakes, commercials, featurettes and anything and everything else that relates to that season of Simpsons with plenty of Easter Eggs thrown in.
If you HAD to choose only ONE season of the Simpsons to get on DVD this HAS to be the one. This is Comedic Genius at its peak. This is a definite for all collections. Remember the finer points of the Simpsons with this pivotal set that oozes grace and social decour. Do what any person would do in this situation and pre-order this season RIGHT NOW!

1010706,5,6305320098,"While most sitcoms focuse on mindless sex jokes and sarcastic remarks that are there for no reason, ""The Simpsons"" is an ingenious satire that speaks the truth about modern day society. Having seen all of the Simpsons box sets ""The Simpsons Political Party"" is by far the best written and containes the most truth about American politics.  ""Sideshow Bob Roberts"" is the smartest and most clever of the box set. It pokes fun at campaign ads saying Mayor Quimby supports revolving door prisons as well as the corruptness that every election contains.  The other episodes of the set are just as brilliant contaning episodes about alcoholism and mocking the system of the IRS. Though it seems false and absurd it is most likely true. And how could I forget the the retaliation by Groening against President Bush after he condemned the show.  The Simpsons is the only reason why T.V. should be allowed in the household.

A great example of why you should pay attention while watching the show comes from the marking form the judges fill in. The idea of 'Future Patriots' getting marked for their jingoism is fun. WHen Flanders Failed offers hysterical insights into Ned Flanders' life, and the way Homer wishes for the business to fail until it actually does is so true-to-life.

1010708,4,6305320098,"The highlight of this title, imho, is Sideshow Bob Roberts, Sideshow Bob's finest moment and featuring some great political satire (I especially liked Bob's intrerview with Birch Barlow, surely one of the greatest one-off characters in the show's history). Trash Of the Titans is just as strong, with Homer's ranting ('Local Nut at it Again' cries the local paper). Only comment on that episode- wasn't Ray Patterson called Homer a 'sleazy lunatic' a bit harsh???.
A good tape, but it's a shame that neither of the other two genuinely political episodes are very good, and the other two on here aren't strictly political (maybe family politics, in a broad sense). Duffless has a few good moments, especially Homer trying to outwit Marge while consulting with his brain, and I Love Lisa is funny and touching at the same time, but the definition was not so much stretched as torn up.",973987200,,882,4.886666666666667

It's best to get the bad news out frist.  The Simpsons Political Party has very litte about the government; in fact it has nothing to do about the government.  But the fact that they have to reach out to government makes your laughs limited.
Now the good news.  For quick laughs you'll want to buy this.  The funniest shows are with Hommer.  From being sanitation commissioner, to working for the FBI.  It's very funny-) Bart and Lisa are on a roll to.  They get to put Sideshow Bob in the slammer and have a contest in science fair.  Marge....... she has the house looking nice.

1010710,5,6305320098,"This is one product that is worth every penny of the price, and then some! From the 1st episode to the last, every second is pure gold. ""Sideshow Bob Roberts"" is an excellent play on the Republican party, but never  gets too offensive to be enjoyed. ""Trash Of The Titans"" is a  humorous, wacky episode with a classic Simpsons musical number. ""Two  Bad Neighbors"" is a very funny episode, in which George Bush moves in  across the street and fueds with the Simpsons. This episode is , in some  ways, a form of revenge on Bush, who badmouthed the Simpsons in a 1991  televised speech. Revenge is sweet, and in this case, excrutiatingly funny.  ""Duffless"" is the absolute best episode of all time, and I mean  of any series. This episode itself is worth the money you pay for all six  episodes! I've seen it dozens of times and I still laugh. ""I Love  Lisa"" is another classic, this time with a Valentine's Day theme, and  it has my favorite character Ralph as the star, so I can't help but love  it. Finally, ""The Trouble With Trillions"", while dropping the  standard some, contains many funny moments making it a worthy watch. This  set is a perfect 10.

There's a sight gag where she morphs into Botticeli's Venus! There's a B story where Bart has to wear glasses and bullies try to beat him up! I like the scene with the nerdy kid putting a Starship Enterprise model kit together! The Mindy character is appealing. The ""I am sweating like Roger Ebert"" joke was deleted from some broadcasts.
