Unless your like the small part of people that collect only the fighting scenes and bits and peices of the Dragon ball Z series and have giant gaps in your collection of Dragon ball z. i hear so many people talk about how Akria started the Dragon ball z but didn't finish it and some people really care. They think for some reason sense he didn't finish it it's not as good. That is stupid to think. The only thing he had to do was start the idea. We have enough people to keep it going. Don't get hung up on makers of animes. Animes are just as good when made all types of people. We are not limited to just one person. And i think Akria was extremely stupid not to finish the anime. He had no idea what he was carrying or what he was making. Dragon ball z is one of the best animes ever made and for him to just quite on it stains he reputation. i real creator of animes would never quick right in the middle of somthing he is making. So i don't think akria is all that good for him just to quite right in the middle of an anime. Who knows how far this could have went. it could have stretched out even further  than Dragon ball G and could have be worth alot more than what it is now. but for some reason he just quite. which makes him a quiter is a small way. He must not have known what he had made or what he was holding when he stopped working on it right in the middle. But don't think that makes him a bad anime creator , it just stains his reputation of making animes.",1056240000,,1538,3.945337620578778

Akira Tori...creator of Dragon Ball got bored after The Saiyen saga in Dragon ball z.  However, he was forced to continue into the frieza saga which is what this dvd leads up to.  Don't buy it, the voices for Goku, and all the other characters start to .... as they are changed, also these episodes just do not have the humor of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. The editing by Funimation and Pioneer takes all the fun out of the series. I would strongly recommend not buying this episode, don't waste 12 dollars on this stupid episode. No dis-respect to .......... intended. I recommend buying earlier episodes in the Dragon Ball collection or the ones late in the series involving Cell and the Androids. They are much better, however if you are an older viewer you would probably enjoy the unedited versions if you can get them.  They are not available for earlier episodes.",982800000,7,1003,4.6440677966101696
