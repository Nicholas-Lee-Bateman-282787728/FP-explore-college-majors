The story begins with a local man talking about the famous outdoor show put on in August 1969 in Bethel New York. Workers prepare the ground (a cow pasture) for the show. There is a raised stage, lights are lifted into position. It took nine months to prepare. Bands rehearse. People arrive on various vehicles, like old school buses rented for the occasion. Unusual costumes are worn. Some dance, driven by an inner spirit. [If you drove south on the Thruway from New Paltz that Friday evening you would have seen tremendous lines of cars waiting to exit.] The various comments tell what people thought. Accommodations quickly fill up in the nearby towns. Helicopters are hired to transport performers and their equipment. An announcer reads messages to the crowd.

The show begins with a song by Richie Havens, how life and war goes on. Clap your hands. People enter the grounds by climbing over the wire fences. Its a free concert now. Next its Canned Heat. Joan Baez dreamed about Joe Hill (framed for a robbery-murder), then sings a gospel song. The Who sing Eddie Cochranes famous Summertime Blues. A couple talk about their non-traditional lives. Sha-Na-Na sing their one big hit. A man talks about yoga. Joe Cocker sings a Beatles song and feels the emotions. Rain causes a pause that creates mud and complaints. Sliding in the mud and other acts are shown. This show will be a financial disaster. Country Joe and the Fish play music then sing. Arlo Guthrie sings about flying into Los Angeles. People pass a joint around. Crosby, Stills and Nash sing and play music. [They needed more practice.] Ten Years After sings Go home to my baby and other songs. Then the Intermission.

The new dawn brings new acts. Grace Slick sings with the Jefferson Airplane band.. Visitors comment on conditions and phone home. Its so great in some ways and so lousy in others. People walk through the mud. Is there gas for cars? A group sings. John Sebastian speaks to the crowd then sings about aging and new conditions. [Does it make sense?] Country Joe sings his big hit song. [Nihilism?] An old man complains about the crowd, he lost all his milk and the hay was ruined. Others comment on the kids. Some bathe in the pond, skinny-dipping. A surfboard in this pond? Santana plays Soul Sacrifice with its frenzied drumming. Sly and the Family Stone sing about getting higher. He asks for a sing-along at night. Janice Joplin sings about not having someone to love. [Maybe its a personal problem?] Can they feed breakfast to 400,000? The portable toilets are serviced. See you later. Max Yasgur speaks to the crowd. What does this show?

Jimi Hendrix plays a guitar in his style and sings. Recognize the tune To Anacreon in Heaven? The empty grounds look like the aftermath of a tornado, clothing covers the grounds. A man tries on discarded shoes. We see the large crowds still there. Then it ends with a view before the show. The credits roll naming the performers and the others who worked on this production. The song Woodstock was written by Joni Mitchell. At the end there is a list of people who have lived. Find the cost of Freedom? This movie is dedicated to the Woodstock Generation. Does anyone use that phrase anymore? After forty years this movie seems less great as if it has aged. [Or is it me?] Those performers are mostly a memory today. History has turned another page. NY politicians passed new laws to ban this type of concert. [I once read that some of the investors bought out the others, then profited by selling the film rights. Does that sound like show business?] This movie, like those from the 1930s, is a historical record of that era. The failure to control and collect admissions put an end to these open space shows. Its the money, not the music, thats important.",1510444800,,3808,4.704647676161919
