7875590,5,6304687761,"PETER GUNN remains a television landmark. A half-hour show with enough material for a feature film in every episode. A groundbreaking marriage of narrative and music--many scenes play like Henry Mancini music videos (from the era when Mancini was cutting great jazz tracks with talent like Shelley Manne). The series' low budget is cleverly disguised behind the minimalist film-noir atmosphere. Blake Edwards created the series in response to the poor television handling of his RICHARD DIAMOND radio show--many episodes were actually rewritten from RICHARD DIAMOND radio scripts! Edwards proved he was an authentic successor of Hammett and Chandler (simply working in a different medium). Gunn is sophisticated, amusing, classy, tough, and always likable. His friendly relationship with Police Lt. Jacoby was a welcome change from the hard-boiled stereotype of P. I.'s who hated corrupt and/or stupid cops. The racy (for the 50's) banter with his night club singer/girlfriend and the bizarre, comic-relief contacts round out the format for this great series. The only complaint with this box set is the poor quality of the picture (it helps explain the low price). Collectors take note that three of the ten episodes were previously issued by Rhino Home Video about ten years ago. A must for mystery fans--PETER GUNN was Blake Edwards at his creative pinnacle.",998697600,8,1361,5.364485981308412
7875591,3,6304687761,"These are the only videos currently available for the vintage television series, ""Peter Gunn"", starring Craig Stevens.  They are not too easy to find and Amazon. Com is one of the few places I've seen them available.  This is a box set of five (5) videotapes with two (2) thirty  minute episodes per tape for a total of ten (10) episodes.  To begin, I  bought this set with a little bit of apprehension.  First, the price for  the five tapes was very inexpensive ($15.83).  Second, they are distributed  by a company that I am unfamiliar with, Diamond Entertainment Corporation.  However, for the price of $15.83 for ten episodes, I thought I would take  my chances.  Well, the episodes themselves were no surprise, your basic  classic late 1950's/early 1960's detective show.  The show was filmed in  black and white which adds a film noir effect.  This, combined with jazzy  background music by Henry Mancini, are a ""cool"" combination.  This is what ""Peter Gunn"" is known for.  As for the quality of  the tapes, well, they were okay.  These are not digitally remastered copies  by any stretch of the imagination, but the quality was decent.  In fact, I  was expecting a lot worse.  Belive me, I've paid a lot more and seen a lot  worse.  With this in mind, if you like Peter Gunn or vintage detective  shows, go for it!",960508800,30,1321,4.650655021834061
