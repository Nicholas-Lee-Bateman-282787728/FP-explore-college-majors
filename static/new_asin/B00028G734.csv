2067311,3,B00028G734,"A nice piece of Nostalgia for the days of the British Invasion of birds and chaps with a lot of nude witches and suggestive dialog.  The director here is Ray Austin, who worked on various Avengers series and Hammer House of Horror.  He does a good job with a middle-grade script.  There is a nice twist here that I was not expecting - so that was a pleasant surprise.

For a good film about witches see Hammer's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-Rides-Out/dp/6305808163/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil Rides Out</a>&nbsp;(Also known as the ""Devil's Bride"" here in the States).

Nevertheless, this is a fun film and the trailers for the Jean Rollins (sp?) films are an added bonus.  However silly ""Virgin Witch"" is these other films look much much sillier.",1333670400,2,811,5.5528455284552845
2067312,2,B00028G734,"The quality was a huge factor in viewing this. We had a great laugh with the pacing and plot - a sinister lesbian hitting on a not-so-innocent virgin? Yay!! And many of the details in the rituals were realistic and nice to see without the overt demonization that it usually inspires in films. Didn't like the implication that the gay woman was against nature but otherwise lots of fun and not just a little bit of tongue in cheek.

However the quality of the film really let it down - the contrast was rammed up so high in this version that all the blacks were complete black and all the whites absolute white and no amount of fiddling with the TV settings was going to make anything in the black areas become more then black. It meant that anything done in the dark/night (which was most of the climax and well, most of everything else) was impossible to see. I felt like a blind person struggling to make sense of the noises I could hear.

The movie was working well enough to really ruin the last scenes which we couldn't see at all. If there were a better version out there, I would spend extra to buy it - the still on the box cover promises some beautiful full colour images which we simply did not get in the film. I wish it were so much more - I really was having so much fun.",1304812800,3,1284,4.236734693877551
2067313,4,B00028G734,"Having a lifelong weakness for Witchcraft ceremonies, Black Masses, Covens as well as late 60's/early 70's fashions and Eurobabes, this film from Redemption was a given for a demented mind such as mine. Lots of British strumpets looking fab in micro-mini skirts, boots and figure-revealing fashions, along with copious amounts of nudity in a Hammer-esque tale of witches and warlocks and sleaze, Oh My! As horror, it's hokum, though a few scenes do capture the look and feel one hopes for in movies of this nature; as exploitation it's admirable for those of us who grew up with Creepy, Eerie and Vampirella mags, Hammer and Amicus Horror flicks, Frank Frazetta and Boris Vallejo paintings. For the rest of you 'virgins', it'll probably suck, so be warned. For the remainder of us Pagans, it's nudity is notable and the cheese index cranked... decide for yourself based on these disclosures...",1287360000,37,893,5.04054054054054

Another silly moment is during the sacrifice ritual when the girl uses her psychic powers to stab the evil modeling agent to death by driving a knife into the ground.

2067515,2,B00028G734,"Virgin Witch (Ray Austin, 1972)

If you hear the name Vicki Michelle and you jump in your seat, you want to see this movie. (Note, after my terrible experience with Bloodsucker Leads the Dance a few weeks back: while Redemption Video got their hands on this, thankfully, that is not the cut you can find on Netflix Instant as I write this.) If you don't, then you can safely pass it by without a worry, but to fill you in: Michelle played Yvette, one of the perpetually-horny waitresses in the smash Britcom 'Allo Allo! in the eighties and early nineties. And that, my friends, is absolutely, positively the only reason you would want to watch this otherwise ridiculous waste of celluloid.

Plot: Michelle and her sister Ann play (not surprisingly) sisters Betty and Christine, new to London, slightly lonely, and looking for jobs as models. Betty is the first to find herself a beau, Johnny (The Spy Who Loved Me's Keith Buckley), but Christine is the first to land herself a job. It involves a photo shoot out at a country estate and, since she has no idea what she's in for, Christine only agrees to do it if Betty will go along. The agency agrees, and off they go into the country. They soon learn that the house is, anecdotally, located on a site that was the home of many pagan rituals back in the old days. And perhaps in the not-so-old days...

All of which could make for a good atmospheric Brit horror film in the right hands (read: Hammer's), but Austin--who made only one feature film after this (1974's Curse of the Dead), but became a very popular TV director until the turn of the century--uses the plot as a premise for getting Ann Michelle out of her clothing as much as possible. And yes, some folks might consider this a spoiler, but given the first paragraph, I guarantee you are wondering if you're still reading this--yes, Vicki Michelle does get naked, however briefly, towards the end of the film. And like I said, that is the only reason anyone could possibly have for wanting to watch this ridiculous movie forty years later. * ",1371945600,8,2054,4.5885558583106265

I sent it back to Amazon for a refund, then re-ordered - being forewarned this time, I C-A-R-E-F-U-L-L-Y removed the disc and put it in a separate case that's better-constructed.

8023645,4,B00028G734,"Decent 70's era Hammer Horror film about witches, and a demonic warlock who draws the attention of two English babes.

 This is what R rated films used to look like before political correctness destroyed cinema, at least in the US it certainly did.  I don't believe we will ever see a film similar to something like this ever again.  It is very slow, with quite a few dull scenes but the sexual voodoo cult scenes of priests and priestesses worshiping the dark prince Lucifer make it worth watching.

 We have a lot sexual nude scenes feature both male and female nudity, but we also have a lot of power spell binging witch scenes of possession and demonic lustful worship, tied in with very dull and boring in between character scenes of the normal activities in and around this English neighborhood where the Tudor mansion is located.

 While watching it I seriously enjoyed the good elements of the film, liking it for what it is and not liking the other dull and not very well developed calm and normal scenes in between the occultism depictions.  It is too bad that these types of films disappeared when the 70's ended, and will never be shown at least in the US again outside of cable, DVD, and the internet.  No modern film would ever dare do what these film makers did back then, unless they were a soft core pornographic movie that is outside of the regular mainstream pop culture entertainment.  Is this a porn movie? No I do not place it in that category but it is filled with naked and deep human sexuality beyond your average R rated level film and certainly far beyond anything shown today in the States with the exception of cable HBO and Starz shows.
