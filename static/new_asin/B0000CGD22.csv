7999484,3,B0000CGD22,"It not a bad DVD, but it does not have Pan's People, Ferne Cotton or Kylie Minogue. Was expecting to see some of the Radio One DJ's and some classics, but it was just a song from each year, some were not that memorable. Overall a blast from the past but not TOTP that we all watched and loved, and not certainly no Pans People or even Leggs & Co!!!!",1324944000,4,349,4.0
