8187898,3,B000OZRXYM,"Peter is a great instructor- lots of depth to his instructions. The asanas are quite out of reach for your average yogi (and I have been practicing for 17 years). His ""warm up"" included poses like bow and wheel. I followed along to most and substituted what I couldn't do. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they had many years of experience with either astanga or some of the more physically challenging yoga styles. I did really like his inclusion of subtleties such as letting the organs drop, breathe until you are empty, etc. I would have given this 5 stars if the asanas weren't so difficult.",1417046400,,607,4.577981651376147
8187899,5,B000OZRXYM,"There are so many yoga DVDs on the marketplace.  This one I picked up at the Yoga Show at Olympia London 2010. I have seen quite a few and often one viewing is enough!  This DVD is so refreshing. As the strapline of the DVD says this is 'Yoga for finding your inner teacher'.  The practitioner - Peter Sterios architect and yoga teacher - is a serious yogi and it shows in both the beauty,strength and power (and yet surprisingly and so endearing is the 'tender softness') of his body as he moves  into the postures and also in the interview at the end of the DVD. It's quite paradoxical as all spiritual practice is.

The setting is stark and simple - no flowers, buddhas, colourful yoga mats and branded clothing to be seen - but that is as it should be because the focus is on the inner world as the four yogis (two men and two women) move with such grace into each asana. Just watching the practice is enough to make one move into the inner sanctum of the present moment. It is appealing both aesthetically and spiritually.  Black clothing, mats and glowing healthy flesh purified through the tapas of practice.  Simplicity itself.

The instructions are easy to follow though admittedly the asanas are not always easy to achieve. The instructions, as you might expect, focus on soft breathing in the posture as well as the placement of each body part and he also mentions the inner body which is vital in order to go really deep into yoga. The inner focus is unparallelled in other  yoga DVDs I have seen. This DVD is for those who have practised yoga for some time (quite a few 'pretzel' postures that not everyone will be able to achieve) and so the DVD presents a lot of challenges which is what you need to keep your practice fresh.

The warm up exercises in the first section are quite unusual, comprehensive and extensive - working all the joints.  Just doing these can be a daily practice in themselves.  This DVD provides days of practice and exploration.  Sterios emphasises the importance of remembering to work with gravity and with grace. As the back cover copy states: 'this DVD guides the heart, mind and body to a sacred space of the present, where everything is temporary and nothing is impossible.'

There are detailed interactive menus, a 30 minute opening sequence (warm ups); a 65 minute Dynamic sequence; a 25 min closing sequence and the special features include a section on Practice Principles and also an interview with Peter Sterios comparing yoga to architecture.

The DVD pack contains a substantial booklet with photos of the asanas and comments that reflect Peter Sterios's philosophy of yoga - this is incredibly useful.  An example quote: 'In yoga asana, work to release unnecessary muscular effort. This is not easy in most Western Cultures, where our training relies on muscular effort to create movement and posture. In Eastern Cultures, where martial arts are taught, movement is not rooted in muscular effort, but in balancing the elemental forces of nature ...'.

If you are serious about Hatha Yoga, this is the DVD you need to enhance your practice. There is no flab or fluff here in any sense.  It is sublime! What excellence! Highly recommended.",1310774400,13,3191,4.7086330935251794
8187900,5,B000OZRXYM,"When film Director Mikki Willis asked me to score this project, I knew nothing about yoga.  For years, I had intended to start, but never got around to it.  As a composer, I make my living sitting down, so I was rather out of shape.  Peter Sterios and I sat for two full days ""spotting"" the film, determining one of three levels of energy for the music to be at various points in the routines, so the score was custom-crafted to the footage -- something that had never been done before for a yoga DVD.

During the process I said to Peter, ""You know, I've never done yoga,"" and he said, ""You've already started.""  Such sage words, because about three months later I took two yoga classes, which started me on my own journey to health.  I did a one-hour power routine everyday for eight months, dropped 20 lbs, and completely cured a chronic back problem.  Peter's video has been a great help, because I can pick my own level, or just dip into one routine at a time if I choose.  The main thing is that even though I've never been able to take a class from Peter in person, I feel that I've had wonderful guidance in his teachings through the DVD.

One more thing... this opportunity gave me a chance to write a lot of wonderful music, something that would not exist had this fine project not come to me.  I receive great mail from many people who use the CD for yoga, meditation, massage, exercise, and just plain listening enjoyment.

Peter does these streches for your arms are wrist that are amazing. These help me with my arms before and after a long day massaging people. Not to metion I  surf alot and the shoulder strechs are second to none. Ive never seen posses like this from any other practioner. The first 30 minutes is amazing this will help the surfer and massage theripst,and anyone looking for something different.

8187902,5,B000OZRXYM,"Gravity and Grace is a must have for anyone wishing to develop their home practice.  The practice was innovative and accessible for all levels.  As an intermediate/advance practicioner, I found it to be a stimulating, well rounded practice with many aspects not found in any other DVD available.  I highly recommend it.",1197244800,15,319,5.096153846153846
