8432138,1,B004K2TYIS,"Bought a DVD of this concert a couple of years ago. It is professionally done....video and audio high quality....but one glaring problem.......... its a sound board audio recording.......there is a clicking metronome the entire time....and the cues for solos, beginnings of songs, etc. are counted off ""and one... and two...and three"". Unless a proper soundtrack has been substituted, its rendered artistically useless",1410739200,2,418,5.758064516129032
