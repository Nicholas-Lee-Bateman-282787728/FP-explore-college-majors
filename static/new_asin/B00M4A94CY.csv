6555885,5,B00M4A94CY,"They were one of the next biggest things on the radio in the mid eighties...Seems everytime you turned your radio on, there was Katrina with her incredible vocal, singing about everything from Sunshine to Crying...and she made her mark on alot of us who grew up with and loved the 80's.

This video ep gives real insight into life on the road, at a time when not only they were selling out shows all over the US and indeed around the world, but when they were at their prime as a band. It has the film clips for: Walking On Sunshine, Red Wine and Whisky, Is That It ?, Do You Want Crying, Sun Street and a live clip of Que Te Quiero, aswell as some interview footage between the songs which shows their youthful joy, and passion for what they were a part of.

They went onto record other great cd's, and also win Eurovision in 1997, but sadly they were not given the respectable marketing they so deserved. Unfortunately, when big time record labels shun you, it seems you're all but a faded memory. In a time when the producers were looking to 'studio enhanced vocals', and 'pretty young things', the only thing that can possibly save you aside from yourself, is fans who are loyal and continue the demand.

This is truly a collectors item, and well worth the look..

Besides, even if you remember them only for Walking On Sunshine, then you will still be pleased with this video ep.

Katrina still shines brilliantly on her first solo CD, Katrina Leskanich also available on Amazon in the UK... check it out !",1149552000,3,1511,4.4601449275362315

  Walking on Sunshine is a fun romantic comedy/musical. The music is a great mix of 80's pop. The actors fit their roles. If you don't like musicals, don't be deterred. A friend hates musicals, and really liked this movie. The musical score fits the story and makes the film have less of a traditional musical feel.

6555925,4,B00M4A94CY,"Stumbled across this movie and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It took top 40 eighties hits and integrated them into the story seemlessly  Story was well written and paced.  The climax was nicely done, but I was hoping for a more powerful performance with the end song that what was presented.  My only complaint is that the singing was not where it should have been and perhaps the arrangements were somewhat ""safe"" in that they stuck religiously to the sheet music and the performers really didn't emote as much in the singing as you would expect from a musical.  The choreography was also somewhat bland, compared to what we've seen in other films. Baby Boomers and Gen X'ers will appreciate the soundtrack a lot!

6555979,2,B00M4A94CY,Silly Movie with cute people. I love a good chick flick but this wasn't one of them.  The actresses who play sisters have no chemistry in my opinion and that hurts the movie a lot. The dancing and choreographing was super mediocre and that might be generous. The Italian actor is pretty cute but his acting and singing are painful to watch.  Its all 80's songs which someone who isn't into 80 's music will hate. It feels like they picked songs and then wrote the movie around them. Not a smart move.  The sidekick friends are useless and add nothing to the movie.  The lip syncing was really bad and distracting. It doesn't take much to be distracted from the plot of this movie though. Don't expect much and you will enjoy the music and scenery.,1479254400,,747,4.430656934306569

6555998,1,B00M4A94CY,"Even with 80's music in the soundtrack I felt very skeptical about this movie.  My last girlfriend saw this available on Netflix, thought that I might like it, and rented it for me to see.  As I hated Rock of Ages and figured that this had to be better and I also figured as I have always loved most 80's music being that I was a child of the 80's I figured that this movie couldn't be all bad.

I can't believe the ghastly acting, the horrific singing, the poor dancing, the way that the storylines within the songs were just forced into the movie's storyline(s) instead of just thrown in naturally where you at least get a flashback. The painfully corny things that the actors would do as if they were attempting to make their own amateur music vids, the fact that this movie spent so much time and energy trying to cram in as many 80's songs as possible which resulted in not only slowing the plot down but also allowing for hardly any breathing time in between.  It was just one song after another scene in scene out.  Taylor, Maddie, Doug, Raf and all the rest of the characters were all grating on the nerves annoying.  The character development was nowhere to be seen as well.

The characters in this are just over-used movie comedy stereotypes.  You've got the pretentious and shallow woman who once had a guy that she loved, lost him, sees him again in hopes of rekindling the relationship but has the conflict of him being with another woman.  You have the hyper, ditzy, and painfully annoying best friend(in this case sister) of whom is frequently with guys and has been with so many wrong ones.  You have the hunky pretty boy ex-boyfriend who doesn't get to have as many lines and just mainly look good to the ladies.  You have his annoying, worthless, and loud friends.  You have the grotesquely unattractive friend that thinks she's all that and much like the love interests friends is bot loud and annoying and just plain adds nothing of relevance to the movie.  Finally there's the sisters ex-boyfriend that doesn't know when to go away.

I thought Rock of Ages was dreadful.  Well as bad as that was, this movie while not worse that R.O.A. is still poorly made and didn't have to be.  This trainwreck didn't really show the 80's songs any real respect or do them any justice in the slightest.  If anything it made a complete mockery of them.  That's totally unacceptable!  I don't know if the voices were the actor's or just lip syncing, but the voices were totally bad in that they were wimpy, off-key, showed no flair or real energy, and just couldn't touch the originals.  The dancing was moronic, showcased dancers that had two left feet, the moves made no sense to the beat, and the visual, music video like stuff that the actors were doing were really dumb and didn't always have anything to do with the song.  The renditions of such great classics as Venus, Don't You Want Me Baby?, Walking on Sunshine(of course), and Eternal Flame and all the others were just shameful and dreadful to no end.  While most of the songs did sync up with what was going on, once in a while one of them wouldn't.  Turn Back Time by Cher for example, just had absolutely nothing to do with what was going on in the scene it was used for at all.

Overall, if you love 80's music as I do and wish to not only see a good musical that's fun, has relatable characters, good dance choreography, good acting, songs that are always relevant to the scenes they're used for, that shows some originality, that has equal parts plot, character development, as well as musical numbers,  and also one that shows respect to the music of the 80's as well as has people performing it perfectly; well then you best look elsewhere because this totally embarrassing trainwreck of a musical fails at every category of what makes a musical enjoyable.  PS It's never even specified as to whether or not this p.o.s. even takes place in the 80's or not.",1473292800,,3931,4.516949152542373

The choreography is spontaneous and enthusiastically performed. In most cases both the singing and dancing seem to spring spontaneously from the action. This may be praise or damning when I say it,but it is much in the spirit of MAMA MIA. I happen to like that film so this is a plus for me.

Not that I am against those things but every movie today, no matter what the story, is full of that stuff.  The characters actually sing, not scream like singers today do. The songs they sing are from the 80's-""Holiday"", ""Don't You Want Me"", ""Venus"", ""Faith"", ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-go"" etc.  The story line was cute.

6556051,5,B00M4A94CY,"I originally rented this on Amazon Video. The moment I watched it I fell in love with the characters and the story line. The description is really inaccurate as it states :""Maddie is ecstatic that she is finally getting married to her gorgeous fianc&eacute; Raf. Her sister Taylor struggles to hold in her feelings for Raf, who is an ex-holiday flame and the love of her life.""

Part of my issue with that description is that they use the word ""finally"" when Maddie has only known him for six weeks and the wedding is only three days away. Another is the fact that they describe it in a way that makes it sound as if they have all known each other a long time when that is nowhere near the case.

The story-line is more like this:
Three years ago, Taylor fell in love with a man named Raf during her summer holiday. Despite the fact that Raf professes his love for her, she feels that she needs to get back to real life and leaves him behind. In the present, after her recommendation for her sister Maddy to visit the same place in Italy, in order to recover from a bad breakup from Doug (someone with whom she was in a toxic relationship with for five years), Taylor received a phone call from Maddy telling her she has to come back to Italy.

Taylor arrives and is surprised by her sisters announcement that she is getting married. Despite Taylor's misgivings, since Maddie has a habit of always going for the wrong type of guy, she agrees to meet the man.

Taylor excuses herself to go down to the beach to see if she can find any of the friends that she and Raf knew the last time she was there. While she is reconnecting with her friends she sees Raf on the beach and instantly is smitten again. However, just as she is about to go talk to him, Maddie appears excitedly telling Taylor that Raf is her fianc&eacute;.

Taylor refuses to tell Maddie of their history together, instead stating that it would be better to pretend as if it never happened. However, with the wedding only three days away, both her and Raf begin to discover that their feelings for each other have not changed at all. Raf insists that he loves Maddie, and he likes the fact that she is very open about love, unlike Taylor. Taylor states that she has never seen the point of singing  from the rooftops about being in love. Raf states that at least if someone is willing to sing it from rooftop, then the other person knows they really care.

During the struggle that Raf and Taylor are going through, Doug surprisingly shows up to try to sweep Maddie off her feet. He insists that they were better together and tries to get Maddie to break off the wedding. However, Maddie is insistent that she loves Raf and would never go back to Doug back because he is immature and toxic for her.

I won't go any further because the ending is both sweet and heartbreaking and better to watch for yourself. (though I'm sure you can probably guess about how things happen from my synopsis.

The music is great. I watch a lot of musicals and there is always one elusive random song I inevitably don't like. Unfortunately this one did not fail in that aspect, but I already has a bias against the song anyway (Bananarama's - Venus). (It's simply because of it's use in the commercials for Venus Razors.) On that one song I think they should have gone with something that wasn't associated or linked to a product that constantly plays commercials that annoy you more than anything else. I can think of at least three others that could have worked instead. However, with it being a British movie, I'm not sure they had to deal with the same type of exposure to that song as we have over here across the pond.

All in all, if you are a fan of musicals and romantic comedies, you won't be disappointed.",1447977600,3,3760,4.412698412698413

6556055,3,B00M4A94CY,"Following the success of the 2008 hit Mamma Mia! arrives Walking on Sunshine, a UK romantic comedy musical starring Hannah Arterton as Taylor, who fell in love with an Italian boy named Raf (Giulio Berruti) in Apulia, southern Italy, three years ago. Their romance didn't materialize, however, and Taylor went back to her country alone.

Cue to the present and Taylor is back in Apulia, where she reunites with her outgoing sister Maddie (Annabel Scholey). Maddie says she is getting married, and her fianc is  a big surprise!  Raf himself.

Helmed by the director team Max Giwa and Dania Pasquini (StreetDance), Walking on Sunshine is a very light-hearted musical featuring the 1980s songs like The Power of Love and of course Walking on Sunshine. The sun-soaked Italian location is beautiful, and the catchy 80s soundtrack is something that stays with you (with Greg Wises vocal just slightly better than Pierce Brosnans in Mamma Mia!), though jokes are corny and musical choreography is decent at best.

Dont expect something unique or innovative. Walking on Sunshine knows what it is doing. It is nothing special, but fun nonetheless.",1437264000,,1138,5.096774193548387
8670205,5,B00M4A94CY,Pure pop fun! I dare you not to sing along!,1532390400,,43,3.4
8670206,4,B00M4A94CY,"This is a low budget musical movie with British actors in the main roles set in Italy, where as musicals do, the cast go from normal talking and suddenly burst into lip singing to songs (not sure if the actors are the ones who recorded the songs in the studio as the only other stuff I've seen them in they aren't singing) and everyone in the background starts a choreographed dance behind the actor who is singing and leading the dance. It's not as polished as Rock of Ages, or Glee or more ""non indie"" type movies/TV shows.  In fact I'd say this movie probably had the budget that would have been spent on one or two episodes of Glee.  The cast isn't unknown, but they certainly aren't A-list actors.  The lead, Taylor a woman who had a holiday romance three years ago in the same beach side town with a local, but broke it off with him to return to ""real life"" and go to university, is played by Hannah Arterton.  If you've watched various Harlan Coben TV shows such as The Five or Safe, you'll recognise her. Likewise her older sister Maddie, a character who has been with a huge number of guys, none of which have been great boyfriends, who has invited her to join her on holiday, but is surprising Taylor with a wedding invite to a guy she's known for three weeks, is played by Annabel Scholey, who has been in plenty of UK TV shows, including Being Human, Medici, Britannia and The Split. Of course that guy she's about to marry, is the same guy Taylor had the fling with, and who Taylor is secretly hoping to hook up with again.  For reasons that make absolutely no sense, Taylor decides not to let her sister know this is the same guy, and makes her former friends and that guy pretend they didn't know her three years ago.

The songs are sung well enough, although the British accents are strong making them different to the original artist versions (even British artists), but at the same time, with a few exceptions such as a rendition of Cher's Turn Back Time, they are sung the same way which is a bit disappointing as it then seems more like watching karaoke, than something new. Some of the background choreography such as the one where the extras are all in lounge chairs, just seems like something that seemed good on paper, but didn't work, but they didn't have the budget to scrap it and come up with a new idea.

Some of the casting is a bit odd too, you wonder if those cast are related to someone investing in the film or are even investors themselves. The ex who isn't accepting Maddie marrying someone else, is old enough to be her grandfather.  Sure there's plenty of these old British sleazy guys trying to hook up with young women, but usually their targets are from Eastern Europe countries where they come across as rich in comparison and their appeal is a better life as some sort of sugar daddy.  Yet Maddie is also British and rich enough to rent a giant house to live in and fly her little sister to Italy.  So where's the appeal there, if she has a fetish for old dudes, or granddaddy issues, why is she marrying a guy in his twenties?  Two of the cast of four ex pat friends living there are morbidly obese, yet the script doesn't do anything with this factor.  In fact we're supposed to believe that three pilots spent the night with one of them.

The songs aren't the greatest songs from the 80's as the DVD cover claims.  But there aren't really any obscure or bad ones, although I hadn't heard of Wild Boys which the obese guy starts lip singing to in between verses where the girls are lip singing to Girls Just Wanna Have Fun. Maybe that was a hit in the UK that didn't go world wide.  Some inclusions are odd choices, such as the Back to the Future theme song, Power of Love by Huey Lewis and the News. Some are obvious inclusions for the plot such as Madonna's Holiday.  Obviously Walking on Sunshine by Katrina and the Waves is used since it's also the title of the movie.  It Must Have Been Love by Roxette would be my favourite rendition.  Billy Idol's White Wedding made no sense being we know the bride has slept with practically every guy in Italy.  I guess they couldn't think of another 80's wedding song. The main investor was obviously a Wham or George Michael fan, as there's both Faith and Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go.  There's also Eternal Flame by The Bangles, Venus by Bananarama, Don't You Want Me by Human League, and How Will I Know by Witney Houston.

The movie is cheesy, to call it predictable would be an understatement.  You wonder why a guy who has known someone for three weeks, would marry her when he seems to have options, including her younger much more attractive sister.
