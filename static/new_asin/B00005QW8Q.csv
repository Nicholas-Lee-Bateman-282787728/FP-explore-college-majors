7951224,4,B00005QW8Q,"I've only been really exercising for a few months, so my fitness level isn't very high, so I guess maybe that's why I feel like this is a good workout for me, going by what other people have said - I can see how if you were at a more advanced fitness level this wouldn't do a whole lot for you.  But it definitely gets my heart rate up and makes me sweat.  The leg section works my legs really well - my thighs are BURNING by the end of that section.  I got some burning in the arms and laying-down section, too, but not nearly as much as the leg section.  The instructor makes this workout fun, too.  I agree that the ball size she has is larger than usually recommended - so it does make some of the workouts harder for me since I have a smaller ball - but I've still been able to make it work for me.",1208476800,,803,3.932098765432099
7951225,5,B00005QW8Q,"Liz Gillies is a knowledgeable, cheery instructor.  You will get a good workout if you follow her instructions.  She tells you how to keep your heart rate elevated--even while lying on your back--so it is a fat burning workout.  If this helps, I'm 42 years old and in pretty good shape, but I'm not (remotely) Karen Voight or Kathy Smith or Denise Austin...
The workout starts with brief instructions about the ball and a short warm-up.  It continues with a cardio section that consists of a lot of bouncing on the ball and lifting your arms which is fun, but also works your legs (if you use them instead of just bouncing).  Then it has two segments that keep your heartrate up:  a standing leg work section--mostly lunge-type exercises--followed by a good arms workout--standing up and lifting the ball.  Maybe I'm a weakling, but it puts my arms to work!  The last part is a challenging (for me) workout for legs and abs lying on the floor with legs on the ball--it also challenges your balance.  This is followed by a cool-down.  The workout is sprinkled with Liz's words of encouragment and instruction.
I think it's a good workout though a little short, about 30 min. The DVD version is a better value than the tape because you get three workouts :)",1068163200,7,1255,4.612612612612613
7951226,1,B00005QW8Q,"This video was useless!! The problem I had with it was that her ball was much bigger than mine. I have a Bally's Total Fitness Ball which is 22"". Her ball was at least 10"" larger. For this reason, I could not do any of the exercises she was doing. While she sat on her ball, her behind was much higher than her knees allowing her to do all kinds of different leg movements. When I sat on my ball, my behind was about an equal distance to the floor from my knees. This made it impossible to do even 2 minutes of the tape. I kept taking my ball and blowing it up with air thinking I had the same size as her, but I didn't. Unfortunately, I can't comment on the quality of the exercise as everyone else has because I couldn't get that far. The beach background and instructor seemed pleasant, though. I just wish the box had said you need about a 30"" ball to do the exercises. It was kind of like buying a workout tape where you need 10 lb barbells (not 3 lb dumb bells) and it doesn't tell you.",1026777600,5,992,4.040609137055838
7951227,2,B00005QW8Q,"As the other reviewer's stated this is not really a cardio workout and therefore can not be a fat burning big ball workout.  It does however do an adequate job of working out your legs and arms.  Your abdomenals get a good workout not only from the floor exercises at the end but because to stabilize yourself on the ball you have to have good core strength.  The instructor seems pleasant enough but overall this video doesn't live up to it's claim and I wear a heart rate monitor so I know.  Also it's really easy to cheat on the leg movements and that will also affect your heart rate.  Beware that the exercises are not as easy to do as they first appear.  I was not in my target heart rate zone for fat burning for more than 10 minutes in the entire video and added another low impact tape to my routine in order to make sure I got my 30 minutes of cardio in.  I do think the leg exercises, if done properly, are quite challenging.  There is a move where she has you twist your knee in the opposite direction and I would exercise caution if you are working on carpet.  You can seriously injure yourself with this move so use a little discretion with any moves where you twist your leg.  I have to also admit that I found her abdomenal workout routine a little annoying because you need exact leg positioning and there is no way to look at the video and do the exercises properly as you need to be looking straight ahead.
I like ball exercises because they teach balance, strengthen your core (abdomenal region) and are good for overall toning so I will do this tape about once a month.  Just don't look for any sort of cardio benefits because it's not there.",1023753600,7,1663,4.298076923076923
7951228,2,B00005QW8Q,"I was disappointed with this ball workout.  I was hoping for a fast paced, high energy workout with some challenging and different moves.  I don't feel like I got what I was looking for.  The moves are nothing new (if you have done a ball workout before) and my heart rate barely moved.
Also, my ball did not work well with this workout.  The ball used by the instructor is REALLY large.  Mine is the recommended size for my height, but didn't work well with many of the moves she does.  Her ball came up to almost high thigh (when standing).  (My ball comes up to about my mid thigh--and when I sit on it, my rear is about even with my knees.)  This factor made it even harder to get a good workout.
Positives:  The scenary in the video is nice and the instructor is good.  The production quality is better than most workout tapes.  And I've given the tape to my mom, who is on a much lower fitness level.",1023408000,3,906,4.209302325581396
