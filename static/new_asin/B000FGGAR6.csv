8122161,5,B000FGGAR6,Well done Step-by-Step DVD. Great if you have the discipline to rewind back and exercise. Some basic guitar skills are recommended. Definitely a good buy if you are determined to learn it.,1379462400,,188,4.90625
8122162,5,B000FGGAR6,"This is an instructional DVD featuring Jamie Humphries of Lick Library, which is an online guitar community featuring lessons, jamtrax, everything guitar basically.  I really enjoyed Jamie as an instructor, he is concise and speaks clearly and is careful to show you the little nuances that are easy to miss.  This is important because these lessons do not contain notation or tablature.  This is not a downside for me, tablature is something that I used as a crutch for some time.  It is detrimental to your playing, I set out to learn all the notes on the guitar and how to read music, it's helped tremendously in learning guitar theory.  I was very happy to give up tablature, it can be a helpful tool, but if you feel like you can't learn something without it, like I once did, then it's time to ditch it all together.  Also, you don't need it here.  You have Jamie breaking down the songs in short parts, so you can learn them in small doses.  He plays each part slowly and explains exactly what he is doing and where his fingers are, using the names of notes and the fret number for those that are not as familiar with the actual note names.  I was literally playing along with him right away.  It's so simple, you can back up if it's a tricky part, he even breaks up the solos into smaller parts so you can tackle them one section at a time.  Seeing the solos played slowly is very helpful.  The menu is easy to navigate, each song is separate and you can also separate each part, you can choose play all lessons, or play intro, verse, chorus first and save the solo and outro for later.  You also get a performance choice, and Jamie will perform the song from beginning to end with a backing track so you can see it all put together.  By the way these jam tracks are available on their website.  I am not a member of the website, but I have ordered some of their jam tracks and it is very helpful to play with them, in regards to keeping time and just the overall experience of playing with a ""band"".  One suggestion I would make for these DVD's, is that I would like to see them discuss tone.  They cover bands like Maiden, Zeppelin, Hendrix, Van Halen in their DVD's and tone is a huge part of reproducing these songs.  It is as essential as learning the notes.  If you want to sample parts of this DVD you can view if on youtube on the official lick library page, that is where I saw some of it and that is what made me decide to buy.  Hope this helps to decide if these lessons are for you.  Up the Irons!!!!",1307318400,2,2520,4.274261603375527
8122163,5,B000FGGAR6,"I really think this DVD is great. Danny Gill is one of the best DVD guitar teachers that I have seen. The video is broken down into pieces so if you just want to learn a solo you can do that. The teaching is slow enough that a novice like me can learn it, so intermediate to expert players should have no trouble learning the songs.

I highly recommend this DVD.",1284940800,,362,4.098591549295775

8122165,5,B000FGGAR6,This is a great video that teaches you the complete songs note for note. Danny Gill who is the instructor is excellent as always. He has a great way of teaching.  These songs was fun to learn and the video instruction was very good. Lick Library has some of the best instructions videos out there. I own about 10 of them and they have all been high quality and easy to follow. I would recommend this video to any METAL HEAD out there!,1205366400,4,434,4.228915662650603
8122166,5,B000FGGAR6,"Using the rewind, pause and slow motion you have using a dvd player/computer, you can easily learn all of these songs. Your skill level of course will determine how long that will take, lol. But they show you step by step, literally, how to play the entire song. And that means the entire song including the solos. If you have or can get the tabs that might help, but I didn't find it necesary at all. As long as you know the strings, EBGDAE, you can figure it out because they tell you which string and at what fret, step by step. You might have to do each step 50 times before you get it right, but again that depends on what you put into it. Excellent series of videos.",1203984000,4,672,4.176923076923077
