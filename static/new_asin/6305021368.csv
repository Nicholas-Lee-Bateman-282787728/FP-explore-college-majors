954944,5,6305021368,"Really, I mean it.  I can't stand Richard Simmons work outs.  But his Tone and Sweat Video is BETTER than anything out there.  It is realistic.  Anyone can do it.  My husband is in the Army and he wants his soldiers to do it, because he feels it is that great!!!!  We do it every day, not because we have to, but because we feel so much more energy when we do.  Anyone can find time for this one as it is VERY short.  Only about 30 min and that is counting the time he takes to instruct you on how to use the toning cord.  You can fast forward that part after you fully understand.
Best excercise video out there today!!!!!!!!!  (and I do Tae Bo, so I am accustomed to more difficult excercise programs)",997574400,,703,4.102941176470588
954945,5,6305021368,I absolutely LOVE this toning video.  You get a great toning work out with the toning cord without hurting yourself!  And of course it helps that Richard is sooooo much fun.  I love you Richard!  Thanks!,990662400,3,203,4.555555555555555
954946,4,6305021368,"This one gives you quite a workout. Although the toning it isn't as  thorough as his Uptown/Downtown tapes, this is more intense with more reps.  With Richard, it's a good idea to get form pointers from other instructors  (like keeping your wrists straight, taxing your muscles without over-taxing  them, keeping your knees over your ankles). But when you use correct form,  this workout is extremely effective. It's more serious than his other  tapes, but he's as supportive as ever. If you're a beginner, you'll be  surprised when you accomplish all the reps because of his encouragement.  Doing this tape will help you build muscle fast!",965260800,19,640,5.0285714285714285
954947,5,6305021368,"This is my favorite Richard Simmons tape. It is very compact and  efficient.  You really do tone and sweat, and you can do the routine with  very little space, so you can easily take it on trips if you have access to  a VCR.",957312000,,224,4.0227272727272725
954948,5,6305021368,"I used this video after I had my 2nd baby.  I tried dieting for two years.  Didn't loose 1 lb.  Then I saw Richard on TV advertising the video and cords.  I ordered it and began using it the same day it arrived.  I was  feeling hopeless, then I got on the scale and dropped 5 lbs, then 10 and  finally 20.  I went from a size 8 dress to a 4!
I have so much energy,  it's crazy!  I love this tape!  Happy exercising",949968000,19,414,3.7529411764705882
954949,5,6305021368,"I'm just starting to exercise & found this tape to be good for helping me get back into shape.  It comes with an elastic cord to provide resistance on the toning exercises.  The first few times I did the tape, I  could not get through all of the repititions and I hurt the next day, but I  can see & feel my progress and now can do the whole tape and no longer  hurt.  I'm beginning to see some muscle too!  The emphasis here is on  toning & firming and there's not an aerobic workout.  The students in  the class are a range of sizes, and it is motivating to see someone who is  bigger than me get through the whole class.  Upbeat music and commentary,  tho not as sickeningly sweet as I expected from seeing Simmons on t.v.  In  fact, I'm going to buy one of his aerobics tapes now & wonder from  anyone who knows this tape which would be a tape of comparable difficulty  to start with?",937699200,6,888,4.129411764705883

955109,4,6305021368,"I love the tape, and the first time I purchased it (20 years ago) the cord came with the tape. I was suprises and disappoints this time when I got the tape but no cord. I just assumed if you are purchasing a tape based on toning with a cord, the cord would come with it. I am having a lot of trouble finding the right size cord to do the exercises with, so right now the tapes pretty useless. My old cord broke after 20 years. I would suggest that you make it clear that the cord is not included so that when people do ace an order they know what their getting.",1424822400,,561,3.9298245614035086

955115,5,6305021368,"I was skeptical about Richard Simmons, but my sister-in-law gave me some of her older VHS exercise tapes and this was one of them.  Now, he is my new ""hero"" of sorts.  I purchased another one just like it from Amazon in case the original breaks.  You get a good workout and it is fun, too.  Richard is great and I have already purchased another of his using hand weights that I use 3 days a week, along with this one at least twice a week.  I am seeing good results.

955191,5,6305021368,"I'm in my 60s and hate to exercise but now I'm getting stiff and puny, so I have to do something.  Without exception, the other exercise tapes out there are just too much for me.  If you're not a fan of Richard Simmons, ignore that and get this tape anyway.  You will change your perception.  He will give you the right amount of encouragement, easy instructions, and a good workout for your whole body, except the gluts.  The warm up and cool down sessions are actually enjoyable.  Depending on how tight you keep the tension on your cord, you can have an exercise session that's rigorous or mildly exerting.  But even if you make it easy on yourself, you'll feel the benefits in a hurry.  It takes about 40 minutes, start to finish, and moves at the perfect pace, he gives you enough time to go from one exercise to another but no excess lags when you learn what's coming next.  Richard knows his audience:  he splits up the crunches into six different sets so you don't realize you are actually doing 96 of them.  I'm losing a pound a week with no change to my regular diet (based on exercising 5 days a week).  I highly recommend this for anyone who hates to exercise but knows they must.  It's as painless as possible.",1361664000,2,1223,4.40625

It's around fourty minutes long, and I like that like most of his videos, he includes a variety of people of different sizes and at different levels of fitness.  Makes you feel more at ease and like you're at a ""real""  workout, not working out with taped ""models"".  Plus, it gives you the opportunity to view the workout at different levels of intensity, so you can modify it to your own situation!

955243,5,6305021368,"I mostly do Leslie Sansone workouts for cardio, but lately have been interested in learning step. The problem is, I have all the grace and coordination of a bull in a china shop and can not follow choreography at all. The moves in this workout are very basic. If you are someone who likes fancy footwork, you will be totally bored, but for me, it was perfect. Richard warms you up on the floor and then introduces the step.  A little bit into the workout, two of the instructors from his studio take turns cueing the moves, then Richard takes over again at the end for the cool down stretch. I was surprised by how low-key Richard is here, I guess I expected him to be a big goof ball, but he really wasn't. The music is instrumental and fun; some of it sounded like renditions of pop music. Overall I enjoyed this workout, am glad I got it and am happy to keep it in my collection. My one wish is that it be re-released on DVD (as far as I know, you can only get it as a used VHS, as it is out of print/production.)",1188864000,6,1016,4.1313131313131315
955244,5,6305021368,"The good thing about this tape is that he works all your body parts---legs, arms, back, abs, and chest.  So you're getting a complete muscle toning workout.  Unlike his faster paced, electrically charged aerobics workouts, he moves more slowly in this tape. The exercises are more concentrated on the different muscle groups.  I haven't exercised in a while, but I could still keep up without feeling behind or out of breath. And, there's always that Richard Simmons energy and gentle tone of encouragement throughout the video to keep everyone going.  As Richard says, ""Don't Give Up!""",1158278400,,586,5.072916666666667
955245,5,6305021368,"I've been using this tape for about 5 months and think it's not only a great toning workout, but fun to use.  My husband bought it a few years ago and when I wanted to lose weight and get toned up, I decided to give it a try - with great skepticism.  I'll admit I was wrong - this is a great tape and Richard Simmons is inspirational, motivational and just funny.

This tape uses toning cords and is about 40 minutes in length.  While people criticize his lack of queuing, this particular routine is fairly simple and moves slowly enough through the exercises that when you use it the first time or two, you don't miss but maybe one repetition while watching to see what to do.  After you've done it a few times, you don't need the advance queuing and it's almost a relief not to have a lot of queuing.

I'm now in the process of buying other Richard Simmons tapes/DVD's because his routines are fun and he's inspirational and motivational.

Since using his tape - in addition to a treadmill, I've lost weight and am seeing results in toning in areas of my body that I've never been able to reach - like my back and shoulders and have more upper body strength.  I've had the worst arms in the world my entire life, but have watched them get tighter and now begin to get some defintion - this is major!  I'm also using his Blast and Tone DVD, which uses weights, and recommend that as well.

I really recommend this for anyone who wants to start an exercise program but may be a little reluctant to start out with weights - or anyone who wants to tone.  I'm a Simmons convert - and I was a tough sell.  It's fun, the time goes by quickly and you'll feel and see the results if you stick with it!!",1104624000,5,1695,4.229813664596273
955246,5,6305021368,"I LOVE this video.  I have tried other videos, but I guess I am very uncoordinated and could never keep up with the people on the screen.  Even with some of Richard Simmons' other videos (like the Disco one), I have scrambled around with arms flying around like an idiot, trying to keep looking at the TV screen every two seconds while trying to keep up with the people on the video.  This one is different.  It comes with a ""tonin' cord"" which is really great. I find it easier to use than free weights and much more fun.  The warmup and cooldown are both very relaxing and enjoyable.  When you are finished, you feel like you got a really good workout.  Richard himself is not very annoying during the workout and at times, he is even funny.  I find him to be very encouraging without making you feel he is superior to you.  He has all body types in his videos, not just skinny blondes.  That is the secret to his success, in my opinion.  One thing I need to mention is that my tonin' cord developed a hole in it after about a year and half of regular use (approx. 3x or per week) and although it is still ""usable"", I felt that it would be hazardous to continue using it.  I have gone on Richard's website and purchased a replacement cord for $9.95.  I would recommend this video and tonin' cord to anybody who wants an easy and fun way to tone up.",1085529600,6,1350,4.2265625
955247,5,6305021368,"This is an absolutely wonderful tape.  He starts with a short- five minute EASY warm-up.  And then moves right on into the toning. The one I ordered came with the toning cord, and he went through very thorough instructions on how to use it before he even started the work-out. The exercises are GREAT. And he does each one of them first, before starting the reps so that you can see how to do it. I noticed results very quickly, and the next day you can really feel that workout! All in all this is a great great video to have. The toning cord kind of stretched out some, so I switched to ten pound weights and was able to do the same exercises. If you're looking for a toning video that is easy but really gives you the work-out this is the one to get.",1010188800,33,753,4.1506849315068495
