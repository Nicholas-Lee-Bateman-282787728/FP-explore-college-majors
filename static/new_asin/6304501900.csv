7873579,1,6304501900,"Bardot, Bardot, Bardot.  In the 1950's and 60's, this name would garauntee box office success.  Unfortunately, this is the new millenium and there is little in this film to amuse viewers.  First, the quality of the print used to make this video was so washed out that the film looks like monochrome.  Secondly, Bardot, while sexy, does little to enhance this slow tale of a young women fighting the age old battle of the sexes with a drifter she picks up and brings home.  Nudity, don't count on it. You'll get more on modern daytime soaps.  If you just have to have more Bardot in you collection, OK, buy it.  If your looking for entertainment, forget it.",973036800,6,656,4.555555555555555
7873580,1,6304501900,"Vadim's films may be exploitations, but they are also contradictory narratives about his own life, his own power in discovering Brigitte Bardot ('And God created woman': modest, isn't he?) and emasculation in having her  transcend and ultimately reject his influence.  This film is typical.  On  the one hand it is an 'anti-bourgeois' (yawn) tale of a woman who leaves  her dull husband, embraces sexual 'liberation' (i.e. hoovers in her  birthday suit) and eventually masters her mean lover in an extended rite of  psychological S&M.  This is Bardot's narrative.  On the other, Bardot  is repeatedly stripped and humiliated for men (her lover; Vadim; the  implied viewer), but shot in a fragmentary way that denies her even sexual  power.  This is Vadim's narrative.  Guess which wins.",962582400,6,786,5.233870967741935
