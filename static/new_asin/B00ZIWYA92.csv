8720388,4,B00ZIWYA92,"The quality is pretty good but this was filmed in standard definition so don't expect HD qualtiy.  The concert itself is very energetic, with a great setlist.  The boys in brazil feature is interesting, tells about the tour and the stuff they went through in their brazil tour stops, some interviews, etc.  The only thing I cant figure out is how to get the MX multiangle views or the easter eggs (they are listed in the item description and on the box, but no menu option for the MX multiangle views).",1441324800,2,502,4.4945054945054945
