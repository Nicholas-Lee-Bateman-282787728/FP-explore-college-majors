3831422,5,B00217TZPG,This DVD training set has really brought my game to a new level. It's also improved other sports related activities that I enjoy. Amazing value!!,1250208000,2,145,4.84
3831423,5,B00217TZPG,Dr. Valiante's DVD was excellent. His instruction was very clear and most helpful. I especially appreciated the drills. Highly recommend!,1250208000,2,137,5.9
3831424,5,B00217TZPG,Like most people I originally picked up the sport of golf and quickly developed a love hate relationship.  How could I continue to subject myself to this highly frustrating game?  I bought numerous gimmicky products all designed to help improve my swing and my mechanics but they only left me at basically the same level I had started (with the exception of a significantly lighter wallet).  What I had yet to learn was that it wasn't the physical aspect of my game that was holding me back but rather the mental.  Ive never seen such drastic results in my golf game as I have after watching and employing the strategies and techniques taught in Fearless Golf.  Thanks Dr. Valiente for finally making golf fun again!,1250208000,2,716,4.696
3831425,5,B00217TZPG,"If you really want to take your golf game to the next level, then this DVD is for you.  I have learned so much from Dr. Valiante about the mental aspect of golf.  His ""Fearless Golf"" book was a game changer for me, and now having experienced this DVD video instruction, I am playing more consistent, mistake free golf.  Thank you!!",1250208000,2,331,4.39344262295082
3831426,5,B00217TZPG,"The Fearless Golf DVD came recommended from a good friend - and I'm so glad I listened to his advice!  My golf game has improved tremendously and I find myself enjoying the course, rather than over thinking every move.  Worth the investment!",1250208000,2,241,4.714285714285714
3831427,5,B00217TZPG,I just finished watching this DVD set and must say it was really helpful for my golf game. I enjoyed hearing from PGA golfers and Gio's insight into how to master my mental game. I would recommend this product for anyone interested in shaving strokes off your game. It's definatley worth the price. A++,1250208000,2,302,4.611111111111111

8348837,5,B00217TZPG,"Excellent resource, changed my game immediately, great purchase!",1408320000,,64,7.125
8348838,4,B00217TZPG,"Good information about the mental game that can help all golfers.  Sometimes it has information you might not need, at least at that particular time but use later.",1384905600,,163,4.821428571428571
8348839,1,B00217TZPG,"Like most golfers, I have purchased a plethora of training aids and videos.  Some are great, others are worthless or very difficult to use.  ""Fearless Golf"" by Gio Valiante was worthless.  He offered nothing but rehashed platitudes.  It would have been much better if he would have offered many more practice exercises incorporating his thoughts and lessons.  I have gotten more usable mental keys from a copy of ""Golf Digest""  than from his ""Mental Keys DVD"".",1369872000,,460,4.9868421052631575
8348840,3,B00217TZPG,"I thought Fearless Golf to be a good DVD/program for the more experienced golfer rather than a less accomplished one.  I think the quality of student the doctor is familiar working with are low to scratch golfers who could benefit greatly from his mental approach.  Being in the right frame of mind prior to a executing a golf shot is helpful especially if you're possess to ability to pull it off.  It's not that I don't think a high handicapper can use his concepts and techniques, the DVD should, in that viewers case, continue to emphasize the importance of technique.  You can't ""free"" yourself from being burdened by a skill you've never had.  A good example is the exercise supplement DVD one of which is practicing 9 different shots, high/med/low trajectories, left to right, right to left flight patterns.  That exercise is useless for a beginning golfer.  I consider myself fortunate in that I fall somewhere in the middle, not a beginner, but not scratch either.  His techniques can help me but if I were a beginner and bought this DVD I would be rather frustrated.  I know a ""rating"" on the DVD might discourage a certain buyer but the reality is this DVD is not for every golfer.",1364774400,,1192,4.6650717703349285
8348841,4,B00217TZPG,"Dr Gio Valiante's content is spot on regarding effective mental approaches to the game of golf, however I felt that the 3 DVD's supplied were quite short and over-priced (approx $100). The 3rd DVD on practice drills was helpful.",1345248000,2,228,4.871794871794871
8348842,5,B00217TZPG,"We've all hit decent golf shots over the years, and of course it is one of the few games where we have the opportunity to play on the same arena as the superstars. The other good thing is that we've all hit shots that the superstars could not have hit better.
As a result the potential to play great golf is in there somewhere.
I really enjoyed watching these DVD's and also reading his book . The section on drills was particularly good with using the same mindset ( or lack of it) that we might use when tossing a paper cup into a waste bin. We do it instinctively . Also the section on target practice around the greens is illuminating and works!!

Having said all that, I would recommend another book which I've recently discovered, "" The Plane Truth "" by Jim Hardy which is available on Kindle. This takes the confusion out of the golf swing and together with Dr Gio's book has given me a new perspective on how to play this great game.",1342396800,,941,4.286516853932584
8348843,5,B00217TZPG,Any professional or avid golfer will tell you that the mental aspect of golf is crucial to success on the course. Dr. Valiante is the leading sport psychologist in the business and this is an excellent example of his work. It will help anyone who wants to shoot lower scores.,1251158400,,275,4.52
8348844,5,B00217TZPG,One of the better golf instruction DVD sets I have watched.  It's also very entertaining as well as educational.  Definitely worth getting.,1250467200,3,139,5.2727272727272725
8348845,5,B00217TZPG,These DVD's really got me thinking about playing golf much differently than I ever had before.  Dr. Valiante's tips and tricks are something that I have ingrained into my routine now.  I feel so much more focused and relaxed when I play now.  I would highly recommend this DVD set for anyone that is wanting to decrease their handicap significantly and get your head straight on what questions you should be asking yourself and what things you can practice to make sure your head is in the best condition to play your best golf!  Best money I ever spent on my golf game!,1250467200,4,570,4.504854368932039
