6958463,3,B00S4YGUGM,JUST OK.  NOT GREAT,1429660800,,19,3.75
6958464,5,B00S4YGUGM,"So what does a mom do? The list might include: laundry, cleaning, cooking, grocery shopping, making lunches, gardening, carpooling, budgeting, organizing the vacations or outings, etc.
So what happens when a mom decides that her family does not appreciate her? She may take some time off and spend a weekend with a girlfriend who wants to pamper her.

Any mom will enjoy this film. So many decisions the family had to make on their own and it was evident that their mom was horrible missed. It was interesting watching the family deal with the mom's absence and then how they pulled together to clean the house , cook, etc. before the mom decided to return home.

This family realized they were in fact taking advantage of their mom and all the responsibilities she has for just about everything. It appears at the end of the movie that there is a family agreement for everyone to do their fair share.

I enjoyed this family movie.

6958465,5,B00S4YGUGM,"In ""Mom's Day Away"", it's Mother's Day weekend again and how does it start for Mom, Laura Miller (Bonnie Somerville), this year? Get up to the alarm clock, make coffee, make breakfast, get the family (her kids, Brandon and Ella) ready for their day, start the laundry, try her hardest to get the family ready for the annual Mother's Day photograph - amid much protesting, pick up her husband's laundry, argue with the children, plus make her own Mother's Day cake. The most important thing going on, although, is the thought of what her life was supposed to be like after a special luncheon with her best friend, Trish (Ona Grauer). The two of these women were going to take on Paris after their school years together, design for a living and lead a life that felt 'worth something more'. As Laura talks to her husband, Michael (James Tupper) upon his return with the kids, he promises to take her anywhere she wishes for her special day, but the situation is that he actually cannot - or will not - take her dancing upon her request. After she discovers that the kids have already gotten into the Red Velvet cake she had made that same morning, Laura has absolutely had it and takes off to Trish's home while emphatically stating; ""I'm taking Mother's Day off"".

She feels so free to have a ""Girl's Weekend"" with her friend, as they head out to a spa. She gets some much-needed pampering, care, and attention while there. Coming out with Trish, she feels like a new woman although seems a little uncomfortable with just how beautiful she really is. Laura cannot help but check-in with Michael and wants to continue this often. If Trish didn't dissuade her, she would be calling on the hour. She goes out and kicks up her heels with Trish singing Karaoke and sowing some oats. After an overnight with her best buddy, she goes to Trish's now workplace after her makeover saying to men there that she ""really doesn't look like this"" while all the staring is going on. While being stunning, Laura is uncomfortable again in her new skin. She begins to be undecided about having it all, as being a Mother and also having a career. Although she is out on the town and having so much fun, Michael is seeing just how much he really does love and need her with him. He learns new and interesting things about Laura and shares them with their children while they take on the many household chores.

Laura is a tried and true mother. She also loves her husband and children and is feeling that being a Mother is fulfilling enough ... But. In the meanwhile, Trish's boyfriend decides that he needs and wants a woman to have a commitment with someone there for him - ""Like Laura and Michael"". Trish offers the finest to Laura to truly show her the good life but is it? Clothes, jewelry, flashy nightspots and the most upscale places to stay. Michael tells Brandon and Ella just how he fell for their Mother as she was upscale when they met, funny and gorgeous. Laura tells others at a restaurant about motherly duties right down to the cost of Macadamia Nuts and why she never buys them and purchases peanuts. It appears that Michael needed to see the value and beauty in his wife, Laura. Michael is missing his wife on their first Mother's Day apart. Trish is not used to being 'mothered' as Laura begins to act once again in her role of caretaker. Does Laura just envy the life of her best friend Trish because she cannot see the loneliness of losing boyfriends because they need a commitment out of her too? Will a whole family learn to see their Mother for more than they did before? Could Laura learn to work part-time and stay at home too? Will Laura go to Paris for an extended stay or is she trying to impress Trish (And what of Trish? She is a whole other story) while believing her family takes her for granted?  This film is for all of the Mothers who feel unappreciated, disrespected and being a plain person within a renewed family structure. It is so worth the view to see Laura understand herself all over again.",1428883200,6,4014,4.518569463548831

6958481,5,B00S4YGUGM,"It was an excellent movie. From a mother's perspective, I could relate to the movie.  It portrayed a mother's life with a sense of humor but you get the message loud and clear.  Even though a mother may feel unappreciated and taken advantage of, she still can never forget her family and how much she loves them.  I would recommend it.  It is a good movie that the whole family could enjoy.",1440374400,4,390,4.375

6958497,4,B00S4YGUGM,"I was having a sorta bad day and it was just the escape I needed. A little predictable and corny, but still felt like I was at a spa resort for a minute, so I enjoyed it anyway. Makes you want to get out of your "" comfortable"" mom slump, and a demand a little more respect and admiration.",1434672000,3,288,3.8983050847457625

8697257,4,B00S4YGUGM,So the shipping on this was great and the DVD worked fine. The movie was entertaining but clearly a Hallmark movie - very dramatic sound effects that weren't needed because you could see the plot a mile away but still enjoyable story about 2 besties who led very different lives.,1506902400,,279,4.6
