8289212,1,B001CTTHK2,"I recently saw this film on DVD. Even by B movie sexploitation standards, this movie is really putrid. It doesn't even fall into the 'so bad it's good' B movie category. It's just plain awful.

The plot centers on a gang of lesbian bikers, who blackmail a man. They catch him in a sexual tryst with a woman in his car, and demand $2K from him, so that they won't rat him out to his wife. From there, the film slides into mainly gratuitous nudity, overblown sex scenes between the lesbian bikers, and the man fretting over how he'll stop the lesbian bikers from ruining his marriage.

The lesbian gang somehow convince the man's wife to go on a picnic with them, where they ride in the nude on their motorcycles, drink beer, and try to seduce the wife. They then take the wife back to their place, where they continue their quest to initiate her into engaging in an orgy with them all.

At the picnic earlier, the wife had let the lesbians caress her naked body for hours. But when they take her back to their place for a wild orgy, the wife claims that she can't, since she's 'not that way' (meaning lesbian). Well gee, if a woman lets other women fondle her for hours on end while she's in her Birthday suit, I'd say that she's in deep denial about her own lesbianism.

The acting in this movie is very mediocre at best. The jazz soundtrack does ad an element of cool to the film. But it doesn't redeem the film overall. The flat, paper-thin plot, is just an excuse to show well-stacked women getting it on with each other. Many, if not most males, get turned on by this. And they're the ones who would actually enjoy this film. For anybody else, viewing this movie is a waste of time.",1262044800,,1686,4.3428571428571425
