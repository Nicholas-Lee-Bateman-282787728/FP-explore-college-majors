8114679,4,B000EVET2U,This is the usual non-stop program of kicking/punching/combo-routines that Billy Blanks is known for. I love the intense moves as there are no long periods of recovery (2 mins each max). This is definately for someone who's done other Tae Bo workouts and either wants to challenge themselves or continue with advanced routines that last up to approx 60 mins.,1276905600,,358,4.983333333333333
8114680,1,B000EVET2U,"This is not the Billy Blanks workout I wanted.  I wanted his Taebo I and Taebo II that shows him in the red outfit.  He does a long workout and has an 8-minute workout at the end of the tape.  There is a basketball star in the back row exercising with him and others.  I have an old, old copy that is about to quit working.  It is not rewinding good anymore.  I want the advanced workout II.",1235520000,,391,3.948717948717949
