7276751,2,B00ZE4ZZOI,"Well, I think we have a new subgenre - Hipster Horror. This b-movie does have some excellent cinematography, and the acting ranges from average to fairly good. But the unoriginal location and story (kids party in an abandoned mental hospital - stop me when you've heard this before) script/screenwriting and dialogue have the feel of rapid-fire hipsterness: trying to pack in quick pop culture references and coolness that ultimately pushes the whole experience down into an unpalatable, banal, boring film that is - like a hipster - very slick and well packaged, but shallow and tedious when you really sit down with it for an hour.",1441497600,,633,4.981132075471698

7276756,4,B00ZE4ZZOI,"Minor plot spoiler you may be able to guess. (The person on the cover is possessed.)

""Exeter"" and ""The Asylum"" (UK title) are the same film. A group of kids hold a party at an abandoned asylum that has a bad reputation. The place is a mess, but still has some electricity and water. A small group of teens remain until the morning and opt to play ""light as a feather, stiff as a board"" with mixed results. At 18 minutes into the film nine tenths of law happens as the kids try to figure out the best way to perform an exorcism using an on-line do it yourself web site complete with pictures and instructions. Just like using a defibrillator.

The film had some metal music (including an Ozzy riff) as well as the typical demonic possession stuff. While there are plenty of films involving kids in an abandon asylum, this is the one that is NOT a cheap hand held camera production. We get a twist explanation about 10 minutes from the end. I think I would have liked the film more if I had that information from the beginning, i.e. plot spoiled and they could of added a few more scenes. The problem is once we get into the meat of the film, it spins its wheels after the intense exorcism. The film has some minor humor, but is not a comedy horror. Acting is acceptable ""B"" horror quality.

7276771,4,B00ZE4ZZOI,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Exeter""

1. This is a B-movie horror film that's better than many horror films that get the full Hollywood treatment. I don't understand why it wasn't more popular.

2. There is a twist to the stereotypical setup. A group of young adults have a party in an abandoned asylum. One of them gets possessed. People die. But the kids have been partying so hard that they are all whacked out on drugs and alcohol and can't quite figure out if what is happening is real or if they're just tripping.

3. The movie is grittier than a lot of horror films. It opens with a heroin overdose and a suicide. It has a heavy metal soundtrack.

4. There is a sly but smart sense of humor in the film. It knows what it is, and it makes fun of itself. In one scene, a cat jumps out at a character, which causes a jump scare. Another character complains that it's so cliche.

5. Most demon-possession movies try to hide the fact that they are just ripping off The Exorcist. This film openly admits it. The characters try to expel a demon by using a DIY exorcism website that just follows that famous scene like a recipe. The characters even refer to Father Merrin.

6. Stephen Lang plays a priest. If you recognize Lang from other movies, you have a big clue as to what his purpose is in this one.

7. The violence and gore is pretty solid and impressive. More people die than I expected.

8. It was directed by Marcus Nispel, who directed the remakes of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th. This movie has a vague Evil Dead feel.",1451520000,4,1549,4.335640138408304
7276772,2,B00ZE4ZZOI,"I didn't like this at all.  I thought it dragged on, the acting was bad as well.  Don't bother.",1449964800,,95,3.9473684210526314
7276773,5,B00ZE4ZZOI,"Great film!
(Almost all) of the acting was sensational and the twist at the end was completely unexpected! If you're into horror movies with creepy twists, this is the film for you!",1449014400,,181,4.6875
7276774,4,B00ZE4ZZOI,I love comedic horror. Great characters!,1448668800,,40,5.833333333333333

7276776,5,B00ZE4ZZOI,"My sister and I both actually enjoyed the movie greatly. It was funny more than scary, it had a couple jump scares. I honestly think a lot of people rated it so low because it wasn't scary as it was advertised. Some people might find it disturbing.

Side note; I don't recommend letting children watch it.",1447200000,3,305,4.446428571428571
7276777,1,B00ZE4ZZOI,blah,1447113600,,4,4.0
7276778,3,B00ZE4ZZOI,Decent. Some good scares and creepy moments.  It isn't without standard horror movie plot flaws.  I liked it tho. If you're looking for something new in horror it's worth the rental.,1446336000,,182,4.838709677419355
7276779,2,B00ZE4ZZOI,"Had some good moments, but mostly a waste of time.",1445731200,,50,4.1
7276780,2,B00ZE4ZZOI,"Seriously, Amazon is charging even Prime members to rent or buy Exeter?  I'd be angry if I paid more than a membership to watch it.  Glad I watched it on NF without having to pay extra.  Or rather ""I watched it on Netflix.""  I wouldn't say I was glad about it.

One of the other things I dislike about Amazon is its 5 star reviewing scheme.  I reserve 1 star for abominations of cinema.  Exeter isn't quite 1 star, but it isn't 2.5 stars (the equivalent of Amazon's 2 stars converted to a scale of 10).  Exeter clings to 2 out of 10 stars.

Unoriginal and uninspired.  No detailed review needed- some teens get trapped in an old decaying asylum, the asylum is haunted by a spirit with an ax to grind, and the predictable ones die or live.  Mix in the usual attempts at one-liner humor, metal music, gore, conflicts within the teen group's stock horror movie characters, and a proufound deeper meaning.  It's pretty much like hundreds of other bad horror movies.

The script is even more incomprehensible than most movies that fall into the Clich of Teen Horror bin, though.  Throughout the movies, the kids are able to use the tablets, laptops, and smart phones to find Youtube videos on conducting exorcisms and various aspect of demonology.  They must have enough bars to call for help.  But, maybe they can't call 911 because it's not a 4G network.  Instead, this leaking, moldy, and decaying asylum that was closed in the 1970's still has operable wifi.  In which case, then Skype, Facebook, email, or whatever for help.

Exeter had quite a few other incomprehensible gaffes in it.  Besides the ""we're isolated and helpless because our cell phones are rendered useless because of our stupidity"" gaffe, another blunder that bugged me was the reason the teens were in the asylum in the first place.  They ended up there because the Catholic Church was rehabbing the building to use as a teen center.  It's wholly unbelievable that anyone would even think it'd be economically sensible to rehab the structure into anything useful.  Plus, it's a big building for a teen center.  It's details like this that just sets the entire storyline off onto a wrong path.  Another incomprehensible gaffe is one of the characters figures out that the evil spirit has something to do with being conjured by the Wiccans.  I'm pretty sure the Wiccans aren't a bunch of dark evil spirit conjurers.  This is all just pure laziness by the writer.  Do some research and put together a storyline with a decent foundation.  Otherwise, instead of being scared by Fat Unpopular Kid now possessed by a Wiccan devil running down a dark hallway foaming at the mouth trying to kill Self-Centered Girl, I'm thinking ""Man, all of that exposed plumbing will have to be replaced.  They should call on their cell phones right now to get an estimate from the general contractor.  Cheaper to build a new building, I bet.  A pre-fab Quonset hut would probably work.""

The acting wasn't horrible.  It had it's ups and downs, but there's enough talent in some of the actors to get them additional roles.  At least some paper towel commercials.  The writer and director are pretty talentless, but the actors did okay with what scraps they were handed.",1444521600,2,3213,4.715827338129497
7276781,4,B00ZE4ZZOI,"A modern day Evil Deal. This movie is now... to what the Evil Dead was in the 80s. Plenty of possession, gore and excitement. Also just like the Evil Dead, once the excitement starts it keeps going until the end. I really liked this movie.

7276795,3,B00ZE4ZZOI,"Who thinks its a good idea to throw a massive, drug- and alcohol-fueled party in a run-down mental asylum infamous for the abuse and suffering of its patients?  Anyone?  Well, in this movie, only one person objects  but hes helpless to stop it and goes right along with the crowd once he meets a certain raven-haired young beauty.  By morning, only our central gang of characters remain, and they decide to do what all hardcore partiers do  try to levitate someone.  Yes, like a bunch of prepubescent girls, they decide to play light as a feather, stiff as a board.  Thats where the trouble really begins.  The next thing you know, they're looking up how to perform exorcisms and discussing ways to hide bodies.  Of course, theres a backstory to all of the demonic goings-on they experience throughout the film.  It all goes back to an uncontrollable former patient named Devon whose unspeakable powers led to the deaths and misery that finally got the asylum shut down over a decade earlier.

Theres really nothing original about this entire film, but it does differentiate itself somewhat by placing its most climactic scene about one-third of the way into the movie.  After that, its just your typical survival horror film where characters try to avoid getting killed or possessed.  Theres blood and gore and some less than spectacular special effects along the way.  On the positive side, the film does manage to maintain some level of suspense about what actually happened to Devon, and I guessed wrong about what the inevitable twist to the story turned out to be.

Honestly, the whole trapped in a creepy mental institution with a demon thing would have been a lot more effective if there was no way for these kids to escape.  They have every opportunity to get out before things really hit the fan.  Then, when they do want out, they just make a few weak attempts to rattle doors.  Most of the windows in this place were already shattered, but no one tried a window.  Even worse, they had Internet access the whole time but never tried to contact anyone outside for help.  I mean, come on.

Still, its a decent effort.  The pacing is good, the girls are pretty, the acting isn't bad, and the filmmakers did actually try to tell a story here, so I have to give them some credit.  There are no scares to be found here, though.  Its worth watching if you're a horror fan, but don't expect to be blown away.",1442880000,,2411,4.632075471698113

None of the elements in EXETER were scary; they were just silly, in my opinion. The story was non-existent, really and the actors were merely, mediocre.

After a while I kept hearing tidbits of clever, dryly humorous dialogue that kept snatching my attention away from my reading. Before I knew it I was pulled into a what turned out to be an underappreciated, effective and surprisingly entertaining horror movie. They managed to take a cliched horror trope (trapped in an abandoned asylum overnight!) and make it original (and actually scary). The abandoned insane asylum they used became a character in its own right...the deteriorated, broken down structure, masterfully lit and filmed, emanated a ghostly, claustrophobic malice. Fans of the genre should check this one out.",1530489600,,804,5.052631578947368
8719913,4,B00ZE4ZZOI,"This was a solid B-flick horror movie.  Truely creepy at times, fun and entertaining.  Do not expect anything too deep and sophisticated just take it for what it is, a fun, sometimes creepy non oscar winning horror flick",1527465600,,220,4.7631578947368425
8719914,2,B00ZE4ZZOI,"Nothing great, too much screaming, brainless kids running around and old asylum get locked in and chased by a demon.",1525996800,,116,4.85
8719915,4,B00ZE4ZZOI,"good movie , a few corny spots. Ive watched this 3x now.",1524614400,,56,3.75
8719916,4,B00ZE4ZZOI,pretty good movie.  Typical teens party at abandoned building and awaken the evil entity type of movie.  But the plot was different enough to keep me interested.,1521936000,,161,4.925925925925926
8719917,4,B00ZE4ZZOI,"A group of teen stereotypes throw a party in the dilapidated ruins of a childrens hospital where Very Bad Things once happened. In a further show of good judgement, they decide to engage in some occult games, with bad results.

From this starting point, the film makers could easily have just phoned it in, serving up a formulaic series of gory murders and jump scares. Instead, they delivered a solid, well-acted, atmospheric horror movie (with gory murders and jump scares too). Good script, good cast, good settings. This movie is worth your time.",1518998400,,550,4.913978494623656
8719918,5,B00ZE4ZZOI,"funny, serious at the end, overall it was comedic and like it was saying it didn't care bout what it was doing, it just said i just wanted to make a movie and play tribute to the horror genre in a comedic way with some serious bits in it, i enjoyed it alot, plus the movie had some nice sex appeal in a way of aesthetics",1517961600,,320,3.8636363636363638
