They have supe -human powers to help them.  In  Vol 7 the fight to save Earth from the evil Sayians begins.  It doesn't  look good for the Earthlins.  Goku, where are you?",953337600,,342,4.234375
8196960,4,6305466920,I think DBZ RULES! with a capital R! I asked my mum for me to buy it and she said if I had enough money and I do and im gonna buy IT someday. I think that NAPA is COOOOOL!And VEEJETA HE's cool too! ITS about this guy  named GOKU. HE LOOKES LIKE a girl but I was mistaken. He doesn't want to  join back with the sayains so he fights them.(geewiz I'd just join with  them save the hard work of blood and guts and stains on your pants DONT YOU  HATE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS!),950400000,,469,3.804123711340206
