2154949,5,B00030AZFM,"What's so enticing about ""The Loveless"" isn't so much the story, well...there really isn't one.  Just a bunch of biker's on their way to Daytona to ""watch em howl"".  Or Robert Gordon's (who also co-stars) great rockabilly film score.  It's Kathryn Bigelow's (Martin Scorsese-esque) direction that keeps you mesmerized throughout.  Co-written and directed by Monty Montgomery  (perhaps best known for producing David Lynch's ""Wild At Heart"").  ""The Loveless"" is an uncompromising look at late 50's social disorder starring Willem Dafoe and the sexy petite Marin Kanter.  Although it could be argued that ""The Loveless"" parallels  ""The Wild One"" to a certain degree, only...Willem Dafoe's character (Vance) seems a little more believable than Marlon Brando's campy over-the-top portrayal.  Thus making ""The Loveless"" not only a cult classic, but an 80's drive-in sensation as well. A true biker masterpiece!

2154950,5,B00030AZFM,If you are a fan of soft Yaoi this is a good one. The characters are well drawn and endearing. The story is well done but the ending was by no means satisfactory. I hope they will be releasing more and finishing the story.,1198108800,,222,4.068181818181818
2154951,4,B00030AZFM,"Twelve year old Ritsuka is unhappy: his brother is dead and he's lost a lot of memories.  One day, a twenty year old man named Soubi shows up and tells Ritsuka his brother was murdered and that he, Soubi, will help Ritsuka get revenge.  Suddenly Ritsuka enters a world of spell battles as he fights to find out the truth about his brother's death, his own memory loss, and Soubi's identity.

During an interview with the main cast, the voice actors agreed that while Loveless doesn't show any sexuality on the surface, there is an undertone of eroticism.  I agree.  There is a constant feeling of sensuality behind the battle scenes and emerging friendships.  Most obvious is the cat ears that characters sport until they lose their virginity, but there is other, darker content as well.

Most notably, Soubi is an S&M sub who wants to be, not just Ritsuka's lover, but his slave.  His dialogue (asking Ritsuka to punish and scar him, talking about pain and how he wants to experience it) regularly refers to pain and control, and how much he wants both.  There's also pedophilia: Two boys try to rape an older woman, while Soubi and Ritsuka have a very intense relationship.

However, none of this content is overt.  It's just subtly present in bits of conversation and various drawings.

What is directly on screen is beautiful.  The animation is smooth, the voice acting is perfect, and the background music is (mostly) lovely.  The spell battles that take place are drawn in a fluid and artistic way that suits the story.  The friendships and romances that grow between Ritsuka, Soubi and Ritsuka's classmates are interesting and walk the line between drama and humor expertly.

This anime is almost perfect.  With solid technical aspects, fascinating characters, and a willingness to face controversial issues without beating the viewer over the head with them, it's an anime that can be viewed many ways.  You can think deeply about the issues presented, or just sit back and enjoy the pretty pictures and sensual atmosphere.

However, there is a drawback: the ending.  Though Ritsuka's social life is resolved, we never find out about his memory loss, his brother, or Soubi's real identity.  This is understandable since the source manga is still unfinished, but it would have been nice to get some answers.

I highly recommend Loveless anyway, because even if you're only getting half a story, it's a hell of a story!",1197158400,26,2425,4.863414634146341

I was first attached to the manga (anouther must have), and figured that the anime would be just as good.  I also secretly hoped that it would give away what was going to happen in future books, but sadly the books have more than the anime.

2154954,4,B00030AZFM,"""The Loveless"" marked the feature film debut for co-director/co-writer Kathryn Bigelow (""Near Dark,"" ""Blue Steel""). The movie was actually Bigelow's graduate student film thesis--a stylized and downbeat little film with a neo-noirish undercurrent that showed enough promise to prompt a brief art house circuit theatrical release--after which it achieved a cult following overseas and, to a lesser degree, in the U.S.

Willem Dafoe exudes a surly raw sexuality in his first credited screen role as 'Vance,' a rough and tumble biker traveling the back roads of America with his gang during the 1950's.  Vance establishes the duality of his character in the very first scene of the film:  He is decent enough to come to the assistance of a lone woman driving along a deserted stretch of road by changing out her flat tire.  However, when the woman offers Vance a grudging pittance for his time and trouble, he doesn't hesitate to reach through the car window, grab her purse and rifle through her wallet until he pulls out a more satisfactory sum.  He then proceeds to plant a groping kiss on her as a bonus.  How you react to this scene is probably a good indication of whether or not you will enjoy this movie.  It is pretty over the top.

Vance and his motorcycle gang are on their way to Daytona Beach for the races when one of their motorcycles breaks down--forcing them to spend the day at a little out-of-the-way garage and cafe off U.S. Highway 17 until they complete the repairs.  The locals are a mixture of the curious and the openly hostile.  The movie tends to drift along rather aimlessly through the first two-thirds of the movie, and then it suddenly takes a rather dark turn, picking up momentum and interest after the introduction of a disturbingly pre-pubescent looking Sportster Debbie (Tina L'Hotsky), a wild child with an instant interest in Vance.  Following close behind is Debbie's psychopathic and degenerate father, Tarver (J. Don Ferguson), precipitating a violent showdown with Vance and his gang.

The film was intentionally designed to look like a low budget 1970's biker film (a la Roger Corman), but it manages to transcend the genre.  Dafoe does not always look completely comfortable in his first role.  He does, however, demonstrate a real screen presence and visually commands whatever scene he is in.  (Some of the other actors are not so lucky.)

Most of the sexuality in the film is implied rather than explicit (with two rather brief and slightly creepy sex scenes), and there is a surprising lack of profanity.  The dialogue is rather stylized--with a great deal of period slang.  Be advised, there is substantial ""dead air"" time (no one talking).  Co-director Monty Montgomery wanted a Sergio Leone (""Once Upon a Time in the West"") feel to the film--with the day drifting along in ""real time.""  The camera often focuses on the scenery, watching the actors performing mundane tasks, and spends a lot of time on close-ups of the tattoos on the bikers' anatomy, wardrobe details and the period-authentic motorcycles.  This is accompanied by a great deal of male posing and preening, giving the film a sensibility that is closer to Kenneth Anger's homoerotic ""Scorpio Rising"" than Marlon Brando's ""The Wild One.""

The cinematography and scorching soundtrack alone are worth the price of the DVD.  The music features rockabilly icon Robert Gordon (who also has a small role in the film), John Lurie, and a brilliant but un-credited film score from Eddie Dixon.  This is augmented by `50's standards from sultry Brenda Lee and Little Richard playing on the jukebox.  (The title line of this review is taken from Gordon's opening credits song.)

Substance may take a back burner to this film's lush and gorgeous style with its `50's mixture of vintage motorcycles, black leather, ducktail haircuts, poodle skirts, roadside diners with Wurlitzer jukeboxes, ribbons of endless highway and, of course, bad boy bikers.  ""The Loveless"" isn't just for gear heads and biker culture enthusiasts.  The film had the odd effect of making me feel really nostalgic for a time I didn't live through.

Extras include a blended commentary track with Kathryn Bigelow, Willem Dafoe and Monty Montgomery; a gallery of still photos; the original posters for the film; the theatrical trailer and scene selection.",1149724800,20,4324,5.008391608391609

2154986,1,B00030AZFM,"This is supposed to be a late fifties/early sixties period piece about nonconforming bikers and their interaction with the residents of a small, rural town.
The problems with the film are numerous.  The storytelling is terrible, as scenes slog their way from one poorly delivered line to the next.  Actors respond to lines or events with maniacal tension, well beyond normal behavior.
The characters all try to be dominant; each line of dialogue with another member of the gang delivered as a challenge.
The acting is stilted and overdone as well, and the whole movie amounts to little more than a very low budget movie with unknown actors and a rookie director and editor.

It looks back with love at a time of no helmets, seatbelts or airbags, of cigarettes, bad coffee, and worse beer, of outstanding sports cars and problematical but heroic hogs, of pointy bras, garter belts, and high heels.

I watched it last night on DVD and received quite a shock as instead of a cool, rebellious and violent motorcycle gang related drama I witnessed appalling acting, dreadful dialogue and a shonky Jazz/Rock N Roll soundtrack played out on a cheap synthesizer. Not Only did Robert Gordon provide a second rate soundtrack he also provided some of the worst attempts at acting I have ever seen. I love biker history and the whole 50's counter culture that sprung from the various motorcycle clubs that began in the late 40's but as of yet I've still not witnessed a better representation of it than in the Wild One. And to be honest even that movie is dated and flawed but the performances by Brando and Marvin still hold it up. If you're looking for some nostalgic escapism then I suggest you consider purchasing Happy Days or Leave It To Beaver because the staid atmosphere in The Loveless that tries to pass for apathetic cool has the effect of watching paint dry or ice melt. Having said that there some laughs to be had although they are all mostly unintentional and as I've already stated Robert Gordon is the main culprit here. Dafoe's attempts to look menacing whilst riding his Harley are hilarious, the wind smashing so hard into his face he can hardly breath but he tries to keep a straight face. The gang themselves seem to have been modeled on the Village People and certainly everytime I saw them on screen all I could think of was The Blue Oyster Club from the Police Academy movies. Although the running time only amounts to 82 minutes I was willing the thing to end so I could get back to some ironing or hoovering or anything to take me away from this revisionist nonsense.

Look, I love anime.  I really do, but what IS it about this whole lusting after the young (& incest) thing, for cryin' out loud!?!  I understand being attracted to the blush of youth; youth is lovely.  I understand the thrill of things considered ""taboo.""  I get it...but to lust after that youth (or brother, or sister, etc.) & act upon that lust is another thing entirely.  I'm no prude, but I have a clearly drawn line, & you'll only find consenting adults behind mine.  Everything else is just NOT copasetic.

As far as Loveless goes, although there are no explicit sex scenes, there is NO subtlety when it comes to what the (adult) Soubi wants, & that is to become twelve year old, kitten-eared Ritsuka's lover & slave.  There doesn't seem there's much difference between the two where Soubi is concerned, either.

A boy enters his sixth grade class room to be greeted by his teacher with that scene you see that this boy is greatly independent. He instantly develops his first fan girl yukio(just first off I want to apologize I'm American and I also have horrible spelling. So I will butcher these names.) She falls for him instantly...He being in sixth grade and disliking making friends, He could care less that she likes him. When leaving school the teacher confronts them and expresses her concern for him and he acts nonchalant and runs off. He meets an adult who grabs him by the arm and forces an conversation(gently forces) within that converstation he confesses that he was friends with the boys brother. The sixth grade boy ritzuka's brother seimi was murdered. So naturally the boy is taken with this stranger. He goes off with the adult to make memories(taking photos). While taking photos they bring the story line in about the fighters and sacrifices also with the fighters names. The strangers name is soubi(which I can spell ^^) His code name is beloved who was seimi's fighter unit, and seimi was soubi's sacrifice.

Sacrifices and fighters basically are this. A fighter uses words to cast spells such as ""rip"" ""tear"" and even as complex as ""retreat as birds carried off...."" The spells are enchanting to hear and the art that follows the spells are wonderful. And sacrifices take the damage for the fighter unit. When they are hurt they are restricted to some extent, arms chained down, collars chaining the victims. When they are completely restricted they lose.

Well upon their talk they encounter another fighter unit who wants the sixth grade to come with them, soubi fights the people and denies them taking him. The boy can't figure out within the fight ,who the bad guy is if it's soubi or if it's the other fighters. But upon the next fight he sees that their organization  was that who killed his brother.

The boy is growing up and maturing and his mom is trying to prevent it by claiming multi personalities.  If I give to much more of the story it will be spoilers but it gets much better

The art of this show is so wonderful. The voices are in Japanese. I dislike subbing a lot of I didn't mind it in this case. But there is a side bit of the soubi being twenty and male falling for ritzuka a sixth grade male. Yoai and illegal but it's not bothersome. It's kind-a a key part of the story but the story really does not dwell on it. It's more so as if they are close friends who try to protect each other and they kiss only a few times in the story they are both androgynous so it won't offend those. No nudity.

The story died on episode thirteen...it was sad ended no warning and should no have ended the manga kept up. Anime died. No sign of any more to come but in the original series imported from japan I got back a few years ago(well I borrowed from a friend.) on the last episode it said something about fundings died and could not continue so rumor is they will pick up later but dunno when.

I would suggest this to nearly everyone",1262217600,,3217,4.4854700854700855
2155065,5,B00030AZFM,I love Loveless for once in my life i read the manga before seeing the anime. Even though it was left with a cliff hanger and there were a few differences it was still perfect for anyone who reads a bad review do not listen to it buyers. the opening music is so romantic and deep. The SD theater is so Rotfl and maybe is hinting to a 2nd season i hope. If you love shounen-ai or the loveless manga get this item!!!!,1261440000,4,415,4.0120481927710845
2155066,5,B00030AZFM,This film made my top 100. The bar scenes were top notch. Story line struck home I come from a small town and was invaded by a biker gang. Caused a stir that is still talked about today.,1244419200,,186,3.9210526315789473
2155067,5,B00030AZFM,"LOVELESS IS VERY BEATIFULL.
THE STORY IS SETTED IN KEMONO WORLD, WHERE KIDS HAVE EARS AND TAILS CAT UNTIL THEIR SENTIMENTAL AND SEXUAL MATURITY.
MAIN CHARACTERS ARE RITSUKA (12 YEARS OLD)AND SOUBI (20 YEARS OLD).
THE STORY IS VERY INTERESTING.
IN A FIGHTER SYSTEM TEAM THERE ARE ONLY TWO PERSON: A FIGHTER AND A SACRIFICE WHO SHARE A REAL NAME.
SOUBI'S FIRST NAME IS ""BELOVED"" SHARED WITH SEIMEI (OLDEST RITSUKA BROTHER). WHEN SEIMEI DIES, SOUBI MEETS RITSUKA AND CHANGES HIS REAL NAME IN ""LOVELESS"", THE REAL KID'S NAME.
SOUBI IS VERY STRONG AND MAGIC IN HIS WORLD, WHEN HE FIGHTS, IS VERY POWERFUL. HE IS THE BEST IN FIGHTER SYSTEM.
SOUBI WANTS TO STAY BESIDE RITSUKA, HE LOVES HIM AND HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE (HIS BEST FRIEND KIO IS JEALOUS).
RITSUKA IS TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND AND HIS FEELINGS ARE UNDECIDED- ""I WANT TO SEE HIM-I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM-TO SEE HIM IS HURT"".
IN MANGA THE STORY IS MORE COMPLETE ( BUT IT'S NOT FINISHED).
SOUBI'S SECRET IS REVEALED, STEP BY STEP RITSUKA FEELINGS ARE MORE CLEAR AND HIS BROTHER SEIMEI IS LIVE, BUT RIT-CHAN DISCOVER THE REAL FACE OF HIS BROTHER AND WHAT HE HAS DONE TO SOUBI.

2155071,5,B00030AZFM,"I haven't read the manga, but having seen a few grainy episodes of Loveless online, I knew I had to get my hands on all the episodes. The artwork in this series is truly stunning, a lot of effort has gone into developing the characters, and there's a nice balance of humour and angst. As much as there's a substantial amount of fantasy, what with magical spell-battles taking place in unused class-rooms and out-of-the-way places, most of the issues experienced by the characters are real-life issues, such as dealing with the death of a friend and/or family member. The only gripe I could possibly have is that I want them to hurry up and make more episodes.",1220918400,,659,4.641025641025641

2155073,4,B00030AZFM,"I'd never even heard of this movie before a friend mentioned it a few months ago.  It's like ""Easy Rider"" meets ""Blue Velvet.""  A strange, moody movie that gets under my skin.",1209427200,,175,4.4375
2155074,5,B00030AZFM,"Kathryn Bigelow (who went on to do a New Order video, Blue Steel and Strange Days) made this movie when studying in NYC as a film student.  This movie truly captures many aspects of a interstate motorcycle run.  There will be inevitable prejudism from the locals, especially men who feel threatened, and then there will be girls who think it's cool.  There's a lot of waiting around to hook up with your group (or gang), it's dirty, and most accurately, Harley Davidsons are known to break down.  (That's why so many people carry them on their pickup trucks).

Forget about Captain America and Easy Rider.  That's the romantic notion that everyone seems to think of when they talk about motorcycle movies. Think Danny Lyon instead. I rode from NYC to California and back with a friend, and we get together every year or so to watch this movie and laugh at Wilem DaFoe's lines.  We both agree that this movie really captures the less glamorous side of going cross country on our sleds.

You also have to have watched the exploitation flicks and Roughies of the 60s to grasp the oeuvre that Bigelow is going for.  Though the actors look way better than your average hog biker, they don't quite act, they just ""go"" through the movie.  Of course, with a cast like Rockabilly star Robert Gordon (whom I have seen perform in NYC at his height), DaFoe, and a motley cast of dirty bikers, you are guaranteed an unpolished performance.

Also the turning of the tables in sexual objectification is a welcomed change, as men get ogled by the camera lens throughout the movie, as the view linger leisurely on their body parts, wearing fetishtically tight motorocycle leather gear, refusing to budge...making us become aware of what mainstream cinema has been doing for so many decades to women.",1209340800,16,1782,4.73462783171521

8035610,3,B00030AZFM,"The Loveless is a beautiful looking but ultimately silly movie. Twin Peaks fans may like it for music, mood, and aesthetic reasons.

Willem Dafoe is great as usual, but his fellow bikers are somewhat effeminate and cartoonishly unconvincing. Are they street toughs from Detroit or extras from a Kenneth Anger short? The answer becomes obvious when the bikers' accoutrements are spotlighted and fetishized Scorpio Rising style. Southerners are unsurprisingly portrayed as stereotypical cliches, especially the main ""bad guy"", who reaches laughably over-the-top levels of sweaty, polyester suit wearing sleaziness.

Making a 1950s period film must have been great in the 1980s, because many of the old motels, diners, and gas stations were still in working condition. You just needed to find a small town and rent some vintage cars from a local car club.

The story is basically:

Some outsiders show up in a sleepy backwards town. The bored local girls become intrigued. This ruffles the feathers of the local men. The conflict builds then erupts in violence.

We've seen this story a million times.

But that simple story is ruined by some overly artsy editing and sound design near the end. The supposedly poignant death of a certain female character lacks gravitas, because the viewer hasn't had enough time to develop an emotional connection with her.

I'm sure the director(s) would say the film is ultimately about nothing and was intentionally pointless to reflect the empty, directionless lives of the bikers.

That may be the case, but they could have done a better job of bringing their vision to the screen.",1506211200,2,1617,5.145038167938932
8035611,4,B00030AZFM,"This film is a slow Southern burn, dripping with sex and fetishistic images of 1950s cars, motorcycles, pointy bras, Coke machines, gas pumps, diner coffee... Wow. Amazing diegetic music a la AMERICA GRAFFITI, and the cast almost to a person looks like they were time-traveled in from the real place.  It's odd today to think of Willem Dafoe as a sex symbol, but he is super sexy in this -- if you're a fan of Dafoe's character in STREETS OF FIRE you could easily imagine this as a prequel.

If you're watching this on Amazon Prime, (as of this writing) the video had several full-screen dropouts that occurred during the transfer, which otherwise is pretty gorgeous and a big step up over the DVD",1504828800,,697,4.612903225806452

8035613,4,B00030AZFM,"Horrible acting, but that somehow fits this movie. Not much of a story. Bikers forced to spend a couple days in a small town while they repair a motorcycle.
