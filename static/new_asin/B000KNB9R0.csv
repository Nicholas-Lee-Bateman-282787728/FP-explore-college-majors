There are other DVDs on this topic that I feel present the facts in more compelling and interesting ways, but that is because I have watched soooo many of these cannabis videos. The only problem I had (and I hope this was specific to my disc only) there were 3 parts in the movie where the disc seemed to have trouble, it was a bit stuck temporarily and the drive didn't seem to be reading... for a short period, then it continued. I could not see any visible signs of scratching or prints on the disc so I figure I got a bad copy.",1336521600,,550,4.101851851851852
8158317,5,B000KNB9R0,"There is no way you can oppose the the legalization of marijuana for medical purposes when you review the scientific and medical evidence that overwhelmingly proves that marijuana is a safe, effective and well tolerated medicine.  The criminalization of medical marijuana is an unreported and overlooked human rights violation, as this film so poignantly expresses.  I have seen other marijuana law reform documentaries such as ""Grass"" and ""In Pot We Trust"" and this had the most impact on me.  It is a must see for all, regardless of your views on the issue.  I also enjoyed how they let people on both sides express their views and not have a narrator direct you to who is right.  It is not to hard to realize who is wrong, it is hard to defend the fact that a federal organization with no medical expertise is legislating one's treatment.",1215302400,8,841,4.732876712328767
