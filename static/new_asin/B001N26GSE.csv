3705303,5,B001N26GSE,"I highly suggest you buy this if you liked season 1. however, if you're just starting  out i would suggest season 1 first. Watch the first episode when you are in a mood to laugh and watch it with your family. (it is entirely appropriate for all ages).
What's even better is that you don't have to watch 2 hours of it. You can watch one episode at a time. GET SMART SERIES ARE MUST SEE SHOWS!!!",1251849600,,394,4.116883116883117

Excellent transfer, these episodes have never looked so good, the sounds quality is fine as well. In case you've never seen the show Don Adams plays agent 86 from Control which is sort of a CIA agency for the USA. Bad guys from Chaos try and take over the world in some way each episode and it's up to the bumbling Max to save us. Good old fashion fun with no foul language or sex and can be watched by the whole family. Cocreated by the funny man Mel Brooks this series is can't miss.",1245542400,,665,4.203125

3705308,4,B001N26GSE,"This another one of the 60s show that was eagerly awaited. Maxwell Smart never fails to thrill the audience with his ingenius tactics ie the hillarious way. Was a young schoolboy when these series were screened by the local stations. The quality of the pictures is excellent,but i cannot say the same for the audio.",1241222400,,315,4.745454545454545
3705309,5,B001N26GSE,"One of the funniest, wackiest shows of all time. One of the smartest, too, although not usually given credit for that. Perfect casting, inspired writing, and wonderfully brought to life by Don Adams, Barbara Feldon, and Edward Platt. The price is very fair, I dislike DVD's that are triple the price that they should be. Great entertainment, great price, a laugh a minute and more. Bring on seasons 3,4, and 5.

DVD MENU PROBLEM: Just for accuracy I should add that the menu on disc #4 is slightly faulty, there's no way to go directly to the final episode because when you select it the DVD takes you to the next to last episode. You have to get to the last episode via the ""PLAY ALL"" method. Amazon replaced the entire DVD set, but the replacement set has the exact same problem. Still a great DVD set, so I gave it 5 stars.",1240272000,8,826,4.398692810457517
3705310,5,B001N26GSE,"Start with the fact that GET SMART was created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry and little more need be said. Buck Henry also served as script supervisor for the series, ensuring that the level of comedy met his standard of funny. There will never be another Don Adams and his Maxwell Smart goes down in TV history as one of the funniest characters ever created. OK, so Barbara Feldon is no great shakes as an actress but rounding out the cast is the phenomenal Edward Platt as the Chief of Control. His work on GET SMART is a textbook example of deadpan humor. If you think shows like FULL HOUSE and FAMILY MATTERS are funny, then don't purchase GET SMART, because you don't know what funny is.",1239494400,,691,4.40625
3705311,4,B001N26GSE,"Get Smart continues for its' second season,Sep/66 through to April/67;and there's no let up in the humour and fun.
We get intoduced to long running series KAOS agent and fan favourite Siegfried,played wonderfully over the top by Bernie Kopell(the later ships doctor on the Love Boat).He's an ex-Nazi who has definitely got his knickers in a spy twist.
Max continues to get himself and Agent#99 in and out of jams by the skin of his teeth;even in spite of himself. The thing with Max is his heart and loyalties are always in the right place even though his skills are sometimes hit and miss. It's always funny to see that Stan Laurel-ish look come over his face when ever he commits a faux-paux,verbally or otherwise. This series' humour is definitely very dry and sometimes the jokes will whiz by before they really sink in,but they are always front and center nonetheless.
Included with this set are the usual commentaries with some eps and Barbara Feldon herself is back to introduce each ep. The last three eps in this season were originally to be a Get Smart movie but instead were turned into a three parter. And I guess the show budget wasn't great because instead of ""Goldfinger"" we have only the ep ""Bronzefinger"";a direct reference and homage to this series roots,i.e.the James Bond movies starring Sean Connery. And of course they send it up in great style as usual.
As with the first season this season is remastered and it looks pretty good. There is a ""disturbing"" audio portion in ""Three spies in a sub"",the first ep of disc two,you might keep an ear open for. At about the 19 minute mark and going for about 60 seconds or so,the actors voices suddenly sound like they are in a hollow tunnel. It is probably something in the original film,but I would have thought with today's technology they could have tried to correct it.
There are no other special features in this season other than the above mentioned commentaries. This set,as with season one,does contains a 4 page insert with an ep list and a blurb written by one of the shows participants;this one by Dave Ketchum(agent 13).
The box set containing all five seasons HAS all the extras,including bloopers,interviews with the writers,producers and a myriad of others but so far none have been included on these individual releases. We might ask why? As an aside I tried to acquire one of those sets into my collection and went through THREE sets and everyone of them had play inhibiting scuff marks/scratches in two or more of the seasons! Just terrible. That is why I am buying the sets individually and so far all is ok. It is just like my experience with the I Love Lucy box set(see my review on that),which I had to eventually give up on and go season by season also. I don't know about you but I have gotten very leery of large box sets anymore. The packaging and quality control seem very lax;the more discs,the more chances of trouble.
In concluding,Season Two of Get Smart is bound to please the fans of the five year running,Emmy award winning series as much as Season one did;and even make some new ones. Unfortunately the makers have for some reason decided NOT to include any of the extras that are extant with the box set,which is very unfortunate.
However the series dry humour along with its' star Don Adams are the perfect match in the show that spoofed the spy genre of the 60s to the Max!",1237075200,5,3376,4.637729549248748
3705312,5,B001N26GSE,"Smart. Maxwell Smart. The dumbest spy in the world, who fights on behalf of the forces of goodness and niceness, and succeeded in making democracy vs. communism a lot more entertaining. And the second season of spies, lies and kookiness only gets funnier, with Don Adams and Barbara Feldon continuing to save the free world.

Don Adams is Agent 86, Maxwell Smart, a not-so-bright spy with an endless arsenal of strange devices and odd sayings. The bumbling spy at a top-secret government agency called Control, which tirelessly works to keep the free world free. He's accompanied by his capable partner/love interest Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon), and overseen by the long-suffering Chief (Eward Platt) who puts up with Smart's constant mistakes.

The second season starts off rockily, with KAOS reprogramming Hymie to murder the Chief, and soon they step up their attacks against CONTROL: KAOS's new leader Siegfried (Bernie Kopell) kidnaps the Chief, and Max responds by kidnapping KAOS's top assassin... unfortunately sparking off a bunch of revenge kidnappings, until nobody is left at either organization.

As the season goes on, Max encounters new obstacles and plots against the free world -- he fakes his death, impersonates a safecracker, goes to Casablanca, tries to solve serial killings in the tropics, works in a circus, suffers amnesia, and is pursued by an evil big game hunter, a la ""The Most Dangerous Game.""

And what's more, and 99 have to deal with art thieves, submarines, mummies, beauty pageants, Arab princes, mouthy KAOS parrots, CONTROL being closed down, smiling killers, bronze paint, the Choker, going to jail, and a seductive woman who may be the dismantlement of Hymie.

The important development of ""Get Smart's"" second season is that Max finally gets a regular nemesis. As Holmes had his Moriarty, so Max has his Siegfried: a heel-cracking German with an exuberant sidekick, and a catchphrase of his own (""Ve don't ____ here!""). Siegfried isn't in every episode, but he crops up often enough to be worth noting.

Basically, the second season polishes up the kooky spy antics of the first, with more slapstick antics, delightfully weird problems (Max as head of the CONTROL workers' union?), and movie homages (""Goldfinger,"" ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" ""Casablanca""). Not to mention those wonderfully improbable gadgets (""Why hide a tape recorder in a camera and a camera in a tape recorder? Why not just take pictures with the camera, and record with the recorder?"" ""Because my mind doesn't work that way, that's why!"").

Don Adams is the heart of the series, with his quirky face, nasal voice, odd body language and confident catchphrases (""And loving it!""). Max is not your usual inept spy -- he's confident that he's suave and competant, and somehow this carries him through to the end. Barbara Feldon plays a wonderful straight woman to Max's goofiness, while Edward Platt is just wonderful as the long-suffering Chief.

As for the new characters: Kopell is hysterical as ""Zigfried,"" an excitable Germanic KAOS agent who is constantly thwarted by Max, which tends to upset him. David Ketchum is introduced as the aptly named Agent 13, an unlucky guy who is always hiding in tiny unpleasant spaces (garbage cans, freezers).

""Get Smart"" didn't get smarter in its second season, but it definitely got better, especially with the introduction of Siegfried. Definitely a must see, for fans of spies and madcap comedy.",1228608000,28,3445,5.126559714795009

3705337,5,B001N26GSE,"Get Smart is a very silly 60s sitcom that pokes fun at the American intelligence establishment.

Along with his slightly less inept sidekick, agent 99 played by Barbara Feldon, they combat the forces of evil and save the wold from ""Kaos"". On the DVDs, each episode is introduced by Barbara Feldon. The color is restored to its original 1960s saturation. Surprisingly, this series wears well even after 40 years because it was well conceived and well written.

Among the agents Max gets in contact with is always Agent 13 who is the best contact that any CONTROL Agent should get into contact with. Agent 13 is almost everywhere you could look for him. He may be in a mailbox, a garbage can, an ice machine, an ice cream vending machine, and many other unusual hiding places where you might find him. As for the notorious agents of KAOS, they have their leader who would become Maxwell Smart's Chief Nemesis. Yes, that leader is Conrad Sigfried  who is head of all operations for KAOS and gets every plot he plans foiled by Max and 99. It is a great and I enjoy it.

3705386,5,B001N26GSE,"Don Adams is back as Maxwell Smart and the biggest asset to the 2nd season of ""Get Smart"" was the addition of Bernie Kopell as Siegfried--KAOS Vice President and chief nemesis of Agent 86. As KAOS VP, Siegfried had many titles--although I remember my favorites being that he was KAOS VP of public relations and torture.

Probably the only thing missing from the show's 1st season was that presence of a chief rival of Smart and a KAOS figurehead we the viewer would want to see return many times to battle our hero, Agent 86. Siegfried was the perfect foil--although it wasn't until the show's 25th episode of season 2 that we get introduced to Siegfried's bumbling sidekick, Shtarker, who of course gets the familiar reprimand ""we don't do that here.""

Of course, Siegfried isn't the only great thing about this season. One of my favorite Max/Chief moments comes at the end of the episode ""Where-What-How-Who Am I?"" when Max hits the ejector seat button in his red convertible, with the Chief still sitting in the passenger seat and Max looks at the camera and says ""Oh boy is he going to tell me off... as soon as he comes to.""

Other standout episodes were ""Anatomy of a Lover"", ""The Whole Tooth and..."", and ""Maxwell Smart, Alias Jimmy Ballantine.""

Overall, if you're a fan of ""Get Smart"" then it would be very smart to pick up this DVD if you have not already.

is exactly what one would expect,
more of the same which, in this case,
is exactly what I wanted.
It has the optional introductions for each episode,
of which there are 30, by Barbara Feldon.
If you enjoy good tongue-in-cheek slapstick comedy,
I can't imagine not enjoying this television show.

It is a comical take on the cloak-and-dagger spy idea.
Maxwell Smart is a spy employed by Control
which is opposed to the organization Kaos.
He and other fellow Control agents, particularly 99,
the woman who loves Maxwell,
under the of authority of ""Chief"",
battle against their opposite forces.

This series was originally shown on broadcast television
from 1965 to 1970 and is chock full of pop-culture and politics
from that time.
It is dated, but that is a large part of its charm.
It may lose some relevance for younger people
who did not live during that time,
but the comedy is so good it overcomes that.

I purchased this for a 13 year old boy
who had never heard of the show before
and he enjoys it a lot.
I suspect that there are many young people
who are unaware of ""Get Smart"".
A great gift.
Caveat emptor: some of the humor
is adult with reference to sexuality,
but it is somewhat tame,
particularly with respect to modern standards
(that's not saying much, I know)

You will be watching all of the episodes

Something about his (and 99's) elegant style of dressing, the way they speak and the big words they sometimes use set it apart, I think. And sometimes they really get in a mess!

3705401,5,B001N26GSE,"I Love this Season of Get Smart as much as the first season. Buck Henry and Mel Brooks have combined to create very light-hearted, satirical look at the life of a spy. Very entertaining and fun for the whole family if you want. It is very fun to see so many actors and actresses making guest appearances early in their careers. Get it, you will love it too.",1255392000,,357,4.264705882352941

8322886,4,B001N26GSE,This is season 2 of Get Smart The Complete Series.  It is just as good as Season 1.  Would you believe it may be even better.  Again it is four discs with 30 episodes.  And a fifth disc with bonus stuff.  Don Adams is perfect as Maxwell smart.  He is sort of like Peter Sellers in The Pink Panther movies.  Except I think funnier.,1491177600,,330,4.0625
8322887,5,B001N26GSE,"This is one more blast from the past. A must have TV show....
They just don't make them like this anymore.
I did see a few people saying it does not have CC Closed Caption on it...
YES it does... BUT REMEMBER.... CC Closed Caption will NOT go through your HDMI cable.
You must use the R.W.Y hook ups. the DVD players are not set up to de-code CC from the HDMI cables like
the new Cable Box's are.
So if you need CC. Closed Caption. You must have a DVD player that has the R/W/Y cables out to your TV.And the TV must have the R/W/Y inputs for them. .....  It is getting hard to find DVD players that have the R/W/Y out puts on them. And more & more TV's don't have them..ARE.. READ WELL. A New DVD player that will decode the CC through the HDMI cable.. My new Philips 4K DVD player drcodes the CC through the HDMI cables.
Look good on your DVD players & TV's.. .Next time you get a new one..",1488931200,2,891,4.00561797752809
