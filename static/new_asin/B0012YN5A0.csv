The BBC's Natural Worlds trilogy of Echo and other Elephants is an amazing story (not yet finished) that will give everyone an insight to the world of this truly remarkable animal. Additional to Echo's southern Kenya homerange of Amobseli you also learn about elephants in other parts of Africa such as Namibia and the forest elephants of the Congo. Once again no one does the wildlife documentaries quite like the BBC... A compelation to treasure,",1210636800,10,460,5.065789473684211
3100370,5,B0012YN5A0,"For those who owned the film on VHS - this is the original version with narration by David Attenborough and Cynthia Moss. The film is wonderfully filmed in Amboseli. Echo and Eli are of course in the centre most of the time, while some of the shots show Cynthia with Kili in the background. Very nicely done. The story is very moving and the narration by DA and CM is simply great. A real must for anybody in love with African wildlife and elephants in particular. Even better - go to Amboseli and do as Cynthia, park your 4WD in the middle of one of the herds in the swamps and turn off your engine and just sit on the roof and listen and look.

David Attenborough is never disappointing even when the subject matter is birds or fish (which are not my favourite topic) because he doesn't speak to the audience as if we were children and the writing is usually very informative.

3100391,5,B0012YN5A0,"I have been on safari in Tanzania several times (and now own a tour company there) and I have been in the midst of elephant herds, but nothing like what I have witnessed in this documentary. I have always loved and admired elephants, but this film reduced me to tears. I swear, elephants are ""more human"" than many humans. The family bond that these giants develop, and the way they take care of each other, is unimaginable until you see it like it you will in this film. My tour driver/guides have studied animal behavior in tourism school but I am bringing this DVD set with me when next I return to Tanzania to help educate them even more on elephant behavior.

And as usual, with BBC productions, the quality of the filming and photography is magnificent. You will feel like you are there in the bush. Crank the volume up so you can FEEL the stomach rumblings they emit as a form of communication.

Sadly, since the time this film was made, poaching has been on the rise. iworry.org states that one elephant is killed every 15 minutes!! If we do not stop the slaughter of these magnificent creatures, this film will be the only way to witness elephants ""in the wild.""

I highly recommend this film to anyone with an interest in elephants, animal behavior in general, and to anyone with an interest in Africa, safaris, or being in the bush.",1404691200,2,1343,4.518518518518518

3100393,5,B0012YN5A0,"Due to their longevity, elephant expert Cynthia Moss determined to make the study of one herd (which always consists of females and prepubescent males) the focus of her life's work.  She chose the ""E"" family due to it's proximity to her field station and relative friendliness.  Animal lovers around the world were enchanted, and perhaps only the chimpanzee ""Flo"" family studied by Jane Goodall rivals the herd as nature's first family.

Through three programs, we follow the story of matriarch Echo and her family, including her kick-butt sister and second-in-command Ella; her son Ely, who starts life with a serious strike against him; her undersized granddaughter Edwina, who is forced to suffer a traumatic first mating; and occasional special guest star Dionysus, the majestic, stately bull who is the favorite adult male of both Ms. Moss and the herd.  Along with Ms. Moss, we bite our nails through Ely's first few days, wring our hands worrying over Dionysus when the local big tuskers begin to fall victim to poachers, fist-pump at Echo and Ella's victory over a nasty neighboring herd, and mourn a terrible tragedy which befalls the herd in part three.

The focus of the story is the fascinating familial bonds between the elephants, but it's also peppered with the realities of two different kinds of people the elephants have to face.  The first - poachers - are pretty clear cut and loathsome.  The second - the local populace (in this case Masai) - work diligently to accomodate the elephants but when push comes to shove are going to protect the means of their own survival, for which no one could reasonably blame them.  With the scenic Mt. Kilimanjaro as a backdrop, this is a not-to-be-missed wildlife collection staple.

As the infomercials say, ""but wait - there's more!"".  Rounding out the first disk, Elephant Nomads of the Namib follows three very different herds on treks through the sometimes unforgiving Namib desert.  The second disk follows Saba Douglas-Hamilton (perhaps better known as a commentator on Big Cat Diary) as she continues her father's work on elephants.  Perhaps the most touching special is ""The Search for Virgo"", in which she attempts to find an elephant who befriended her father and gave her a traditional trunk touch greeting when her mother presented her to her after her birth.

All in all, the best overall elephant documentary collection.",1377648000,,2392,5.025316455696203

3100397,5,B0012YN5A0,"I owned ""Nature: Echo of the Elephants"" which included: ""Echo of the Elephants"" and ""Echo of the Elephants The Next Generation.""  I bought this DVD and because I love David Attenborough (and he narrates this version). This is a two disc DVD, the first disc includes:

1. Echo of the Elephants - story of Echo and her new born calf Eli, and researcher Cynthia Moss. Hand down the best elephant DVD I have ever seen.
2. Echo of the Elephants The Next Generation- con't story of Echo and her family. Also excellent.
3. Echo of the Elephants: The Final Chapter - recap of the first two DVD and an update on what has happened to the elephants. I found this a bit slow and lots of repeating from the first two Echo stories.
4. Elephants Nomads of the Namib Desert - hour long look at two desert elephant families and their struggles living in the desert. Very good story.

Second DVD is about Saba who is also an elephant researcher in Keyna. All of these are 30 minutes long.
1 Living with Elephants: Saba helps an African woman find a herd of elephants so she can apology to them. (I didn't really care too much for this one.)
2. Nabibi's Desert Giants: also about the desert elephants, but also some great shots of other animals like Sea Lions and desert lions. (This was very good.)
3. Search for Virgo: Saba searches for an old elephant named Virgo. (Kind of of slow story.)
4. Elephants of Samburu (parts one and two): Saba and her adventures with several herds of elephants and rescuing of an abandoned baby elephant. Really enjoyed it. Lots of great footage.",1290902400,22,1560,4.5053003533568905

It can be used to teach children about family and the purpose of extended family, the sense of belonging to a group and the reality of belonging to something larger than oneself, the purpose of sacrificing the good of one for the good of the many, and the meaning of working together to insure the continuation of all of life of the group.",1254009600,3,501,4.434782608695652
3100401,5,B0012YN5A0,"Readers of my reviews will know that I am a sucker for both David Attenborough and Elephants. I'm happy to see a good documentary that combines the two. This set is actually a combination of several documentaries focused on the elephants in Amboseli National Park in Kenya. Each episode was done at a different point in time, so you can actually see how Echo and the other elephants in the family grow up. Cynthia Moss, a top elephant expert, provides commentary along with Attenborough.

The second disc stars Saba Douglas-Hamilton, daughter of the famous elephant expert Ian Douglas-Hamilton. Her documentaries include a mix of elephants, experiences with locals, following researchers, and other wildlife. It goes beyond Amboseli into the Namib and other parts of Africa, which is a nice touch. My favorite scene on this disc is actually her attempt to radio-collar desert lions.

This disc is far superior to another documentary about Echo,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nature-Echo-of-the-Elephants/dp/B000AC7PAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nature: Echo of the Elephants</a>. First of all, it has Sir David Attenborough as the narrator, which makes a big difference (trust me, having seen both recently, I can attest there is a difference). Second, this disc has several episodes and over 5 hours of footage, whereas&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nature-Echo-of-the-Elephants/dp/B000AC7PAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nature: Echo of the Elephants</a>&nbsp;only includes the first documentary (around 40 minutes).

3334897,5,B0012YN5A0,"A wonderfully written and produced series.  Not only does it inform people about the life of elephants but can also teach us about life and the meaning of life.  It can be used to teach children about family and the purpose of extended family, the sense of belonging to a group and the reality of belonging to something larger than oneself, the purpose of sacrificing the good of one for the good of the many, and the meaning of working together to insure the continuation of all of life of the group.",1254009600,3,501,4.434782608695652
3334898,5,B0012YN5A0,"Readers of my reviews will know that I am a sucker for both David Attenborough and Elephants. I'm happy to see a good documentary that combines the two. This set is actually a combination of several documentaries focused on the elephants in Amboseli National Park in Kenya. Each episode was done at a different point in time, so you can actually see how Echo and the other elephants in the family grow up. Cynthia Moss, a top elephant expert, provides commentary along with Attenborough.

The second disc stars Saba Douglas-Hamilton, daughter of the famous elephant expert Ian Douglas-Hamilton. Her documentaries include a mix of elephants, experiences with locals, following researchers, and other wildlife. It goes beyond Amboseli into the Namib and other parts of Africa, which is a nice touch. My favorite scene on this disc is actually her attempt to radio-collar desert lions.

This disc is far superior to another documentary about Echo,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nature-Echo-of-the-Elephants/dp/B000AC7PAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nature: Echo of the Elephants</a>. First of all, it has Sir David Attenborough as the narrator, which makes a big difference (trust me, having seen both recently, I can attest there is a difference). Second, this disc has several episodes and over 5 hours of footage, whereas&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nature-Echo-of-the-Elephants/dp/B000AC7PAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nature: Echo of the Elephants</a>&nbsp;only includes the first documentary (around 40 minutes).

This is a video we really would like to be able to enjoy, but so far that has not been the case. I would like to order it  again if I can be assured that it will not be defective.
We have purchased many BBC DVD's in the past and never experienced this failure. I hope someone will read this review and respond to me.",1522972800,,446,3.9444444444444446
8248398,1,B0012YN5A0,"The Echo documentaries themselves are outstanding and all deserve 5 stars. This disc, however, will NOT play, like many of the other reviewers have mentioned. Unfortunately, I noticed too late for a return. Be warned.",1512345600,,217,5.228571428571429

At about the same time I bought another copy as a birthday gift for my great niece and it too won't play. We tried all the DVD's on multiple blu-ray players, VCR's, computers, etc, and none of them will play. I hate it because I love these docs and they can't be found anywhere else. But fyi for everyone: you'd better think twice before buying a copy - you'll probably regret it.",1505174400,,472,4.0212765957446805
8248400,1,B0012YN5A0,"Pay attention to the one-star reviews for this product. There must have been a defective batch of these made. The copy I received was certainly a dud. Only three out of the eight programs in the set were playable. The others skipped, froze, or even made the DVD player stop. I tried two standalone DVD players and three computer drives and the problematic programs failed on all of them. Basically the discs are laced with bad sectors that cause read errors, so buy at your own risk.",1503014400,,483,4.563218390804598
