8209437,5,B000TGWD82,"The Beer Hunter series was far too short-lived, especially in light of Michael Jackson's demise last summer. I was hoping that The Discovery Channel would honor him by releasing the series on DVD and updating his two software titles and re-releasing them, but that has not happened. I guess beer still doesn't rate very well in this country. Following the travels of Mr. Jackson makes one want to make the same journeys and sample the same brews that he did; but, failing that, gives one some delicious entertainment right in the living room. He willingly shared his intimate knowledge of beer characteristics with the world and helped us all to view that malted beverage in ways we might never have imagined. This is a worthwhile investment and I am glad to have found it. Now, if the DVD's are ever released...I'll be back for another purchase.",1214697600,12,846,4.801369863013699
