8446424,3,B004X7VRKI,"The Boston Strangler, 2008 film

Albert DeSalvo calls his doctor from prison; he wants to talk about the Boston Strangler who killed many women who lived alone. They show the attack on one young woman. The details are printed in a newspaper, this compromises the investigation for the police. A woman picks one man out of a line-up. Later Albert introduces himself as a talent scout for a modeling agency and impresses a young woman and gets her to disrobe. Later the police arrive to investigate the death. There is not one MO to indicate a single murderer. We learn about Albert DeSalvos personal life and his problems with his wife. The police find another victim, the knot around her neck is different. Later another woman is attacked and strangled. The killer wears gloves to leave no fingerprints. The type of knot is a clue, also the ages of the women, says one detective. A politician reorganizes the police squad. A computer will be used to gather reports: 37,000 pages!

DeSalvo has a car accident and is sent to a hospital. An inmate recognizes him from last years line-up. Albert doesnt sleep much. They show a shooting from an earlier time! One policeman worries about his wife; he heard a noise. The police visit DeSalvos cell to talk to him. He is a family man with a child and a dog. [Newspapers predicted the killer would be an unmarried man.] DeSalvo wants the reward money because he is facing life in prison now. This reward will be split up. The confession ends the mystery. Alberts brother and sister-in-law talk to him, and question his decision. A hospital for the insane is better than Walpole prison says Albert. Albert studies photographs of the crimes to refresh his memory. A man arrives to tape-record his confession. [Is he being coached?] They recreate the strangling (he used a stocking). Lets take a step back. But Albert is sent to Walpole! He was afraid of this.

Albert was a former MP in the Army and a boxer. But he wants to change his story after six years. He calls his doctor to tell the truth about the murders. [Who was listening in?] Two men enter his cell. Snitch is all they say. Albert was killed in prison from multiple stab wounds. The last victim of the Boston Strangler had DNA from two different men, neither of them DeSalvo! The murders of the Boston Strangler was never solved in court said the Epilogue. Did DeSalvo take the blame to put an end to the hysteria? Were careers made from this conviction?

This is a good story in spite of its low budget and weak script. A book will tell you more about this case, if you want to spend your time on that. There was very little about life in Boston and America shown in this movie. These events occurred around 1963-1965. The Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 was a shock to the nation and was followed by many other changes in society. The War in Vietnam grabbed peoples attention from other events.",1452038400,,2904,4.589595375722543

8446426,3,B004X7VRKI,"I was expecting a slasher type of film from the ad cover. Instead what I got was more akin to a historical drama. This is what we believe is the story of Albert De Salvo (David Faustino), the man who confessed to being the Boston Strangler. The film shows several women being strangled, but not really grindhouse style, more of a Hitchcock style. The accents were good. The acting and plot was decent, although the story just never grabbed me. There is no nudity and no graphic rape scenes, just disturbing strangling scenes. It is interesting from an historical sense, but not overly entertaining. Yet, not a bad film. Hence the so-so rating.
