I play along with the instructor and have learned lessons that will help me in other fiddle songs.
I recommend this to anyone looking for a great teacher and some great lessons.",1215475200,4,236,4.511627906976744
2141188,5,B0002Y4TXI,"This is a good instructional video.  Its probably more a lesson in Jay's style and technique than anything else, but it has a lot of good tips for dressing up melodies.  I think its definitely worth getting if you're a fiddler.  My bluegrass fiddle teacher is friends with Jay and Molly.  She originally started out with classical training as a child so she's very picky about technique.  She says Jay dosen't have the best technique she's ever seen, but it works for him.  She's probably right too, but still he has some really good tips for fiddling.",1188950400,8,552,4.639175257731959
2141189,5,B0002Y4TXI,"Jay Ungar is a fiddler of the highest calliber. When he teaches, he does it in a very clear manner and does not reflect any arrogance. If you follow his instructions to the letter, you will find you are able to play the tunes in a very effective manner. This is a superb choice for anyone serious about learning to play fiddle.",1170720000,19,327,4.290322580645161
2141220,5,B0002Y4TXI,"Great DVD.....None Better!  GREAT Customer Surveys....Convincing.....Yep, I ordered another CD!  Thx, LesH",1419638400,,106,7.75
2141221,5,B0002Y4TXI,"Jay Ungar is the Mr. Rogers of instructional fiddle DVD, and I mean that as a compliment.  So reassuring, simple, and clear; unassuming, patient, a good teacher of what's important, respectful and kind to his accompanist on the guitar.  I liked the clear description of pulse, tone, and expression.  He described how to create doublestops in 6ths (inverted 3rds), and to practice by playing scales in 6ths,  in a way that translated theory to actual physical keyboard layout and finger placement that made sense and dissipated the despair I had been feeling about ever understanding chord progressions on the fiddle.  The video focuses helpfully on what he is actually doing on the fingerboard and with the bow, in ways that made it possible to see and mimic.  The DVD is organized in a way that makes sense - song by song, and breaking down each song in a way that makes it easy to stop the DVD, practice what he just showed, and move on to learn the next component.  Not every teacher understands what it is that a beginner/intermediate needs to see and learn in order to do what the teacher is showing, or the progression of building skill on skill until you can do the whole thing - but Mr. Ungar seems to.",1404950400,10,1210,4.6
2141222,5,B0002Y4TXI,This is absolutely amazing!  I would recommend this to all levels of fiddlers.  Beautifully done and love the fact that you can watch it over and over.,1398816000,2,151,4.555555555555555
2141223,5,B0002Y4TXI,"This is a wonderful DVD and absolutely would recommend it to anyone who not only wants to learn some nice fiddle tunes, but to also just watch a master at work. Jay Unger, accompanied by his wife, Molly Mason, demonstrate some beautiful waltzes in a very laid back manner. You feel you are sitting in their living room for a personal jam. Jay Unger is incredibly talented, and I like that he spends some time discussing the subtleties of emotion when playing certain songs. I.e. The Tennessee Waltz is really sad and think about the words while you're playing. You will NOT be disappointed with this instructional DVD. I am a beginner fiddler and was able to start learning the waltzes by simply watching Jay play note by note. I learn by ear so for me this was great, but for those who only read music, he tells you each note he's playing and there are great closeups of his fingering technique.",1388275200,5,896,4.537037037037037
2141224,5,B0002Y4TXI,I was able to down load the written music to this collection.  It was beautiful and accessible in its score.  A plus for Jan Ungar again.,1377043200,3,137,4.230769230769231
2141225,5,B0002Y4TXI,Enjoyed these lovely tunes and having them taught by Jay Unger is a real treat.  Got to love these melodies.,1372636800,3,108,4.4
2141226,5,B0002Y4TXI,"This is a really nice teaching DVD!  The tunes he plays are beautiful.  The manner in which they are presented is such that an intermediate violin student can follow the instruction.  I really have enjoyed it.  But then just about anything that Jay Ungar does is ""tops"" to me.",1358812800,2,276,4.571428571428571
2141227,5,B0002Y4TXI,"This is an Excellent choice for a beginner to intermediate fiddler. He teaches the songs in a way that a beginner can learn the base song and then build upon that with double stops, slides, bowing, ect. I like that his wife plays the guitar along with it so you can keep time better than with a metronome. You will get your moneys worth with this dvd.",1331251200,7,351,4.253731343283582
2141228,5,B0002Y4TXI,"I've had this video for about a year so thought I should write a review. I have quite a few 'learn to play' fiddle DVD's but this one is by far the best. The close-up shot's of Jay's fingering are great. He explains in detail how he get's his fiddle songs to sound so great - all the slides, double stops etc. He doesn't go into detail on which notes he's playing, if you can't read music, he just shows you. You learn by watching what he is doing. Molly's guitar accompaniment really adds depth to the learning experience. My only hope is that they will make another video. If you've been wanting to learn to play 'Ashokan Farewell' you must get this.",1319414400,2,652,4.308943089430894
2141229,5,B0002Y4TXI,"Jay Ungar does an excellent job of teaching the tunes on the DVD and gives other helpful tips to playing the fiddle. He goes slow enough so you can follow what he's doing and the cameraman also did a good job in focusing on his hands so you can see what he's doing. Jay's wife, Molly Mason, accompaniment on the guitar is also a plus. I have just started playing the fiddle, but I found that I could follow it and I think that it is would be useful for those that are beyond the beginner stage as well.",1298246400,3,502,4.08080808080808
8034564,5,B0002Y4TXI,Excellent jay explains and demonstrates well.,1522022400,,45,6.666666666666667
8034565,5,B0002Y4TXI,"I purchased this dvd at a concert, having already been a longtime fan of Jay Ungar and Molly Mason. Their music was what originally inspired me to pick up the fiddle, and it's lovely having a guided tour of the style I enjoy so much. They are both such kind and wonderful people, and their encouragement and love for their music shine through in this video. I personally learn most pieces by ear, so the lesson format works very well for me as an intermediate musician. Sometimes I'll pop it in for background noise when I'm not even playing, as it's very soothing to listen to! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys playing folk-type music. In my (deeply biased) opinion, Ungar is the very finest fiddler out there, and I'm excited to sound more like him.",1484611200,,773,4.568345323741007
8034566,5,B0002Y4TXI,Quick shipping just as described. This is a fabulous DVD for any fiddler.,1453939200,,73,4.6923076923076925
8034567,5,B0002Y4TXI,Very good tutorial on playing Jay Ungar's music.  Love it.,1445385600,,58,4.8
8034568,5,B0002Y4TXI,Made me buy more tunes by Jay and Molly. Pretty soon I'll be going to Ashokan!,1444694400,,78,3.9375
8034569,2,B0002Y4TXI,"Drove 800 miles back home early from a jam in N.C.  When I met him he was all about promoting his music camps.  Not really impressed with him as person.  Yes, he wrote Ashokan Farewell and is basically living off the reputation of the Ken Burns Civil War (excellent) reputation.  Go learn from Bruce Molsky, REALLY nice person and great fiddler.",1435708800,,345,4.60655737704918
8034570,5,B0002Y4TXI,Super product.  All good!,1434499200,,25,5.25
8034571,5,B0002Y4TXI,"Very helpful to a beginner-intermediate fiddler. Ungar is an excellent teacher and one can learn a great deal from watching him repeatedly, which is what a DVD allows. Very well worth the price for 5 private workshops with a master fiddler.",1430006400,,240,4.878048780487805
8034572,4,B0002Y4TXI,Excellent DVD. Love Jay's teaching. Would like to have more songs.,1420070400,,66,5.090909090909091
8034573,5,B0002Y4TXI,"Jay Ungar is a brilliant fiddler, and adds a lot of ornaments to his playing that make his style very distinctive.  This teaching DVD allows you to see how he adds those extras to his fiddling, and he is a very good teacher.  He goes slowly, breaking songs down into small pieces, and gives explanations about the best ways to play a song.  This DVD might be somewhat difficult for new beginners, but players who have some knowledge of scales and rhythm will be able to follow it.  No music reading is required, Ungar teaches by ear.  I really like this DVD because you can play along, pause and then hear someone play it back to you, as well as getting instruction.  If you're interested in fiddle ballads or the slower, more expressive side of fiddle, this is an excellent resource.",1419897600,3,784,4.524822695035461
