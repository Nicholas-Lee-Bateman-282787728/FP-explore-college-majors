It's not fast pasced and she doesn't make you get up and down off of the floor. You feel stronger and heathlier.  I love doing something to keep my body heathly in this easy to follow DVD.  I recommend it to everyone. I have even purchased other copies for my family and friends. You just need to try it to love it!",1330473600,8,486,4.020833333333333

Thank you Gentle Yoga.  I hope everyone tries this simple educational DVD.",1330300800,4,247,4.72093023255814
4859120,5,B005QNT31S,"I am a health coach and used this DVD while staying at my 80 yr old mom's house. She asked me to exercise with her using this DVD. Being in my 40's, reluctantly agreed since the DVD was directed to the senior population.
But I was really surprised! It was very good and gentle. I rarely do yoga but may start doing it more often because I have a whole new appreciation for it after using this DVD. Thank you Paula!!!",1319846400,13,416,4.148148148148148

8483509,1,B005QNT31S,"I received the first video and it skipped and got stuck during playing.  I was sent a second one and it started out working but as I played the DVD, this one also began to stop and skip.  I am sending both of them back and expect a refund to my account.  I tried them on two different DVD players to make sure it was not the machine, but it happened with both tapes.  I am disappointed because what I did see of the video seemed to be a perfect match for my age and ability.",1431907200,2,474,3.90625
8483510,4,B005QNT31S,"I had been taking a chair yoga class with a wonderful yoga teacher who moved away.  I have searched for a video to take her place.  This video is almost as good as having a teacher in your home.  It is not only good mobility movements, but has a wonderful mediation sequence that really relaxes me.  I would recommend for good strengthening too.",1430352000,,345,4.428571428571429

8483512,5,B005QNT31S,"This is a very relaxing yet effective workout-just what I need after a day of work that keeps me on my feet.  I am 69 and am more focused on kind to the body workouts anymore.  Paula is a wonderful instructor and the DVD is well made in a peaceful, serene setting.  I love it so much I just ordered her other DVD.  I can't find one thing wrong with it and for me , that's unusual because there is usually part of a workout I don't really like.  Also, I slept like a rock last night and it could very well be the effect of Paula's Yoga.",1379548800,4,535,3.9166666666666665
