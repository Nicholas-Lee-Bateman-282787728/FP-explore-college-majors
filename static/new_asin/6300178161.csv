211913,4,6300178161,"I first reviewed this great drive in flick over in the VHS section (review titled ""Late Show Movie Classic"").  Since that time I was very surprised to see it come to the DVD format.  Unfortunately the quality is substandard to say the least.  Horrible streaking & scratches, a pinhole of light on the righthand side of the print, pitiful color saturation...just like my old beat up VHS copy.  My only concession is that being on DVD, it should last indefinitely unlike my old VHS tape.  As for the movie, my old review still stands.  Lots of fun, uniformly good acting (for this type of picture), great music & sound effects add to the chills, excellent cinematography by the great Dean Cundey (of ""Halloween I, II, III"", ""The Fog"", ""Escape From New York"", ""Romancing The Stone"", ""Back To The Future II, III"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Apollo 13"", ""Big Trouble In Little China"" fame), tons of back water swamp atmosphere, genuine scares, a clever twist ending, and of course...the old ""guy in a chintzy bigfoot costume"".  There's no high tech effects or gore & it's fairly slow paced, but it has a genuine charm & it outshines 95% of the other horror dreck that is out now-a-days.  Old timers Jack Elam & Dub Taylor chew up the scenery while John David Carson & Dennis Fimple yuck it up as the two college guys who track the beast.  The DVD back boxcover mistakenly identifies John David Carson as ""Pahoo"" (one of moviedom's all time classic character names) & Dennis Fimple as ""Reeves"" while in fact, it is the other way around.  So that shows you the poor care Sterling Entertainment exhibited in making this DVD. They tout ""Guaranteed Superior Quality"" on the boxcover...  I know it's just a low budget horror flick that they figure nobody will care about so they just throw something against the wall to see what sticks & sell a few copies.  But come on, you can't even get the facts correct on the boxcover, let alone getting a better print to master from?  I'm sure the original film makers have a decent print but I'm sure Sterling doesn't want to have to pay them their due but using their materials.  As for the extras...they are worthless as well.  So unfortunately, a shoddy piece of junk quality wise, but it's no worse than my VHS copy.  So, enjoy the flick & try to excuse the poor quality.  Make sure you watch for Pahoo's 70's-style jersey that sports his name on the back!  Classic. I love this movie but I wish they'd have taken a bit more care in the quality department.  I docked the film one star for this unfortunate sorry print they used to master.  It kind of adds to the 70's drive in feel none the less.  Thanks to the creators Joy Houck & Jim McCullough for all the years of enjoyment I've gotten from this scary, campy & funny flick! The DVD is a welcome addition to my ""Creature"" poster & lobby card set despite the poor hackjob Sterling did in mastering the DVD. Thanks to Amazon for offering yet another great ""lost find"" to their growing list of offbeat films & stuff you'd never find at your local stores. Bravo!",1044057600,16,3037,4.545955882352941
211914,4,6300178161,"""Creature From Black Lake"" is one of those 70's late show movie classics that has sadly been forgotton. Is it cheesy?...sure. Is the creature a high tech CGI effect ala the blockbusters of today... no, it's a guy in an ape suit (which you bearly ever see). But is it entertaining? You betcha! The acting by old time thespians Dub Taylor (who makes one great backwoods pappy) & the OVERacting by Jack Elam (who chews through the scenery like a wood chipper) is lots of fun. The two younger leads played by John David Carson (who's looks should at least keep you fellers girlfriends interested) & Dennis Fimple as goofy ""Pahoo"" (one of moviedom's all time classic names!) are fine as well. Bill Thurman does a nice job with the thankless sheriff role. Jim McCullough, Jr. adds a top notch good ol' boy song ""Exits & Truckstops"" as well as lending his acting chops to the role of Dub Taylor's grandson ""Orville"" (plus he wrote the screenplay thus completing what I like to call ""The Black Lake Trifecta""). Now throw in some nice Louisiana swamp water atmosphere, a frightening flashback sequence, some 1970's small town southern diner vibes, some ""wonder what's out there in the dark"" camp ground scenes, add a couple of Louisiana girlies for the boys to hook up with, toss in a pinch of frightening movie score, some extremely creepy cinematography by Dean Cundey (of ""Halloween I, II, III"", ""The Fog"", ""Escape From New York"", ""Romancing The Stone"", ""Back To The Future II, III"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Apollo 13"", ""Big Trouble In Little China"" (WOW! what a list)), a MAJOR twist ending (very clever boys!)...and of course the guy in the ape suit...and you have a beautiful cajun stew cooked up by director Joy N. Houck, Jr. No there aren't thrill a minute effects or gore of any kind. It's actually pretty slow paced & laid back. But this film has a genuine 1970's drive in movie ""feel"" to it & atmosphere to burn. I like to pair it up with ""Legend of Boggy Creek"" for a true backwoods drive in double feature that despite it's modest budget & limited resources, outshines & outwits 95% of the brain dead horror films of the modern era. Give these good old boys a chance & see if they don't charm your socks off. One star demerit for the shoddy copy I bought a few years back.  Amazon's offering might be better. The version I have looks like it was copied on a VHS camcorder directly from the wall that a 16 mm projector projected it onto (haha). But ironically the grain, chopped off edges & horrible color only adds to the ""feel"". Give it a shot...how can you go wrong for a couple bucks? Worst case scenerio, you can re-use the tape to go shoot your OWN cheesy Bigfoot flick!  Best case scenerio...Joy Houck & Jim McCullough finally get this classic out on DVD with some extras!",1029628800,3,2776,4.583501006036217
211915,4,6300178161,I give it 4 stars because this was very creepy. I would not like to go camping after a movie like this.think of it like a Blair Witch/Bigfoot movie. The horror begins when two anthropology students go to the Louisiana swamp country to search for the creature starring Jack Elam and Dub Taylor. The only thing bad about this movie is the ending on of the students gets attacked  by the creature and ends up in the hospital and the movie ends. Nothing happens to the monster it just ends.

His friend isn't as lucky. At this same time, Pahoo and Rives, two college students / Bigfoot hunters (Fimple and John David Carson), are in the area. Soon enough, they meet up w/ Grandpaw, who, after a quick bribe, and a sing-along, tells of his encounter w/ the ""skunk-ape"". It's not long at all before Pahoo and Rives have evidence of the beast's existence. After a romantic interlude, featuring  a pair of beautiful town girls, the creature makes an appearance.

212023,5,6300178161,"The first, and as far as I know, the only Bigfoot buddy movie. Rives (John David Carson) and Pahoo (Dennis Fimple) are college students who drive their van into Louisiana hoping to find Bigfoot, and maybe some Cajun women as well. They find both, actually, and it's a memorable trip.  This is a really fun low budget movie.

Low budget horror films from the mid-70's are often many wonderful things--raw, scary, disturbing, inventive. Very seldom, however, are they warm and endearing, with characters so real that you forget you're watching a movie. But that's what you get here. This is a film of rare qualities.

The ""creature"" Rives and Pahoo are after is shown only fleetingly, and that's probably best. The idea that the thing is lurking in the darkness, just outside their camp, is nicely conveyed by sound effects and the actors' performances. There's a good number of scary, spooky moments. When the scares arrive, they're doubly effective because the film has taken its time building up the characters and making them likeable.

Dialogue will often kill a horror film, but when the talking scenes happen, I find myself listening with rapt attention. The story of a family tragedy indirectly caused by a Bigfoot sighting is upsetting, and realistically presented. And then there is the famous ""Chicken!"" speech, which explains why Pahoo has a deep-seated obsession with hamburgers.  Does this film feature less ""horror action"" than an average horror film? Arguably, this is the case. Is this a boring picture? Not at all.

Dennis Fimple (""Pahoo"") was recently in ""House of 1,000 Corpses,"" his final film role.  He worked fairly often as a character actor in the 70's, and was in Disney's ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"" and DeLaurentiis' ""King Kong"" remake. He's just great here as one of the friendly Bigfoot hunters.

All in all, a surprising film that focuses on the people who are searching for the Bigfoot, and not on the Bigfoot itself. It's been released on VHS and DVD and isn't too hard to find. A recommended buy or rental.",1342828800,,2036,4.898255813953488
212024,5,6300178161,"I had been looking for this movie for quite a while. I remembered it from when it first came out. The story is not the best in the world, but for the time it was really pretty good. You have to remember its a 70's movie.",1304899200,3,220,3.8043478260869565
212025,4,6300178161,"""Creature From Black Lake"" was released in 1976, just in time to cash in on the ""Boggy Creek"" and general bigfoot mania. This film is a hilarious example of B-movie fare, and has a lot to recommend it to people who love drive-ins and the ludicrous bargain basement films they used to show. I knew when I saw the opening credits roll that this was going to be a classic of the genre (starring Dennis Fimple and John David Carson, and featuring other luminaries such as Jack Elam, Dub Taylor, and Roger Pancake,) and I have never been more right. This is a classic of B-movie filmmaking, guaranteed to make any fan laugh and roll their eyes alternately.

The film opens (allegedly) at the University of Chicago, which is a very prestigious school. Here it looks amazingly like a junior high school, and the anthropology class on bigfoot is pretentious yet funny. Two college students of advanced age, Pahoo (Fimple...I love this character name so much,) and Reeves (Carson) are so convinced of the existence of bigfoot that they con their professor into giving them a terrible old van and some money to take a field trip to Arkansas and Louisiana to find proof of bigfoot. Immediately thereafter, we are introduced to one of the major motifs of the film: driving. They drive all over the place, and the Director, Joy N. Houck Jr., doesn't let us miss a moment of the excitement as they drive from Illinois to Louisiana.

Eventually they make it to the small town of interest, and Sheriff Billy Carter (Bill Thurman) immediately makes it clear to the boys that they are not to investigate Sasquatch in his town, and they are definitely not to become involved with his daughter, Becky (Becky Smiser) and her friend Michelle (Michelle Willingham,) which they, of course, do. I can't blame them: I didn't care anything about this movie until Becky showed up, but her appearance made it all worthwhile. I also find it ironically amusing that the Sheriff's character name was Billy Carter. Bearing in mind that this was released in the spring on 1976 and the ghastly horror of the Carter administration with all the spectacular foibles of the real Billy Carter was mere months in the future, I couldn't help but draw amusing parallels. The characters of the two men are somewhat similar, only the Sheriff in the movie is vastly more cultured, erudite, and intellectual than the President's brother was.

Pahoo and Reeves start talking to locals, and quickly work their way to Grandpa Bridges' (Dub Taylor) house, where he tells them about the creature in exchange for cash. Before it's over you get to see Dub, first topless, and later in pajamas, and he even brandishes a harmonica and sings! How could this movie possibly get better? (At least in this film he chose not to wear an ""Ex-Lax"" shirt, which is, sadly, not always the case with Dub.) When the taboo subject of the creature comes up over a heap o' vittles, Grandma Bridges gets the vapors, provoking Dub's wrath. This scene is likely the worst-acted in the film, and is one of the worst performances in any movie ever. Despite Dub's displeasure and the no end of emoting he does, he does rescue the boys from his barn when they are attacked by the creature, who turns out to be less frightening than most of the locals. I cannot overemphasize how cheesy this mangy skunk ape is.

The boys go camping and invite the girls, resulting in a bad case of Sheriff interruptus. Billy Carter jails the boys, and subsequently also jails drunk old Joe Canton (Jack Elam,) who has the most evocative phlegm-clearing scene in movie history and is the man they wanted to speak with anyway! What are the chances? Jack tells them to come out to his home in the swamp. After they are released they do so, and he tells them where to find the creature. They go camp in the yeti's lair, and much hokey drama ensues. There's a pointless subplot about Vietnam, there's a hilarious scene where bigfoot plunders a tent, there's a shooting, a stabbing, and eventually a meeting of the minds between Billy Carter, Pahoo, and Reeves, but only after the horrifying creature rolls the awful van down an embankment and sets it on fire. The ending is as ridiculous as anything you have likely ever seen, and I won't spoil it for you, it's just too delicious.

The DVD comes with extras: some very brief production notes and star biographies. Humorously enough, Elam and Taylor got biographies (and deserve them, no doubt,) but the stars, Fimple and Carson, get nary a mention. This is a patently ridiculous movie, but if you are amused by B-movies from decades past, this is hard to beat.",1282089600,3,4611,4.694684796044499
212086,4,6300178161,"I really like this movie.  It's of the classic B horror variety and also campy, but for what it is, it's very well done.

212087,1,6300178161,"I actually do hate being critical of any horror film because, as a genre, such flicks tend to catch a lot of unwarranted negative comment and there are truly some really superb ones.... in this instance we are NOT discussing one of those superb ones. In fact,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creature-from-Black-Lake/dp/B00007M5I5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creature from Black Lake</a>&nbsp;might just be the worst horror entry ever produced because it doesn't even achieve the sometimes revered distinction of a ""cult film"" such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Baby/dp/B00000JN2R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider Baby</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plan-9-from-Outer-Space/dp/6305760403/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a>. I'm a huge fan of horror and sci-fi movies (especially the older films) and films such as this one simply arm certain critics with more ammunition to bash the genre, which is my biggest complaint here.

So what makes this film so incredibly egregious? Allow me to first make some general observations and then I'll enumerate the specific problems.

This movie was clearly the brainchild and dream project of one Jim McCollough, Jr., who evidently envisioned this film as a vehicle to launch his writing, acting, and music career on to the fast track. After seeing Black Lake, I was prayerful that the reverse was the case but I checked around and he did evidently produce another film in 1994,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/St-Tammany-Miracle/dp/B0009NZ6MU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">St Tammany Miracle</a>, (yet another horrific film where Steve Allen took the hit as the star actor). Apparently either this young man's sire, Jim McCollough [Sr.] must have funded the Black Lake project, or, McCollough just dropped the ""Junior"" thing so that the film credits wouldn't look quite as ridiculous, (it didn't work), ergo:

Producer: Jim McCollough
Screenplay: Jim McCollough, Jr.
[Character] ""Orville Bridges"" played by: Jim McCollough, Jr.
""Exits and Truck Stops"" composed by: Jim McCollough, Jr.
""Exits and Truck Stops"" sung by: Jim McCollough, Jr.
""Exits and Truck Stops"" played by: Jim McCollough, Jr.

And so on.

Here's the story in a nutshell: Two nave Alpha-male students of the University of Chicago get all excited about their professor's convincing lecture detailing ""Bigfoot Creatures"" and they decide to head south and invade the bayou to verify a report of one such monster. The citizens of this backward, one-hoss town are quite unenthusiastic about the young men's objectives and they are warned off the project in various ways, including a direct threat by the local sheriff. They finally locate one person who's willing to talk about the region's dark secret, ""Orville Bridges,"" (played by Jim McCollough, Jr.!), who directs the two to his home, out in the swamp (Black Lake?) where he lives with his maternal grandfather (played by Dub Taylor, a superb, well-known actor) and grandmother. Orville relates the story, to the two students, of his mother whom had been indirectly killed by the creature, so the Bridges family remained very loath on any discussion that revived this tragic episode.

From there, the boys experience a few brushes with this local ""Skunk Ape"" and the movie continues to deteriorate from this point. One sub-plot is that the pair pick up a couple of local gals who are lauded as raving beauties (a redhead, the Sheriff's daughter, whose overall attractiveness is so-so while the second girl is an outright homely blonde) -- of course, the Sheriff catches them all in a somewhat compromising situation at the boys' campsite just as an encounter with the monster ensues, all of which works out badly for the boys. I won't go further on with the story as the prospective viewer can pretty much envision the subsequent laborious film footage.

The casting for this film, Jack Elam and Dub Taylor excepted, is horrific. This is surely the most dreadful group of actors ever assembled for ANY purpose. The worst of the lot is Dennis Fimple (!?!?!) who plays ""Pahoo,"" the more gregarious of the two students and the story's chief protagonist.

The dialogue was written by a conversationally-challenged person (now, WHO was that again?). Here's a tired line from the scene where the boys are initially driving south in their van: [Pahoo] ""Gas... gas!"" [Rives] ""Thanks for warnin' me."" (Knee-slappers which are equivalent to this one plague the remainder of the film).

The camera work was carried out on a student level, albeit the opening footage of the bayou is fairly scenic. The film was directed by Joy N. Houck, Jr. (I never heard of a guy named ""Joy"" but I'm certain that there's plenty that I've never heard of), a fellow who also owned a string of about 200 movie theaters throughout the southern U.S. I can't say too much bad about him in particular, given the script and actors with whom he was un-empowered -- he actually did garner the most from Elam and Taylor who, despite the script, played out their roles to the best that could have been achieved by anyone.

The monster in this one is a bit of an enigma. This Bigfoot is sort of a semi-amphibious one, this aspect being revealed in an opening scene where it dislodges its first victim from a small johnboat down into the depths of the swamp, the critter being re-viewed a few frames later walking away on to the spotty dry land in the bayou. So, I guess that I'm saying that such amphibious activities really do not square with my own limited Bigfoot knowledge... I suppose that in horror films one is permitted some level of artistic license. But this underwater nuance did strike me as a rather strange and unnecessary caveat, perhaps having been installed for the sole purpose of fulfilling one's expectations of the movie's title.

As a weak final defense of the film, one might assert that this flick was meant to be a tongue-in-cheek exposition; however, not even that rationalization will fly as they really tried to make the monster and his intermittent appearances seriously scary. So, there goes that one!

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creature-from-Black-Lake/dp/B00007M5I5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creature from Black Lake</a>, produced in 1976 (lots of period bad haircuts!), is shot in color, the aspect is full-frame, and it runs for a grueling total of 90 minutes. I own the ""Silver Series"" edition on DVD, a product of Boulevard Entertainment and distributed by Alpha Video.

There's little need for me to continue beating this dead horse so, in summary, I'll just point out that this is a tragic entry in the horror genre of film-making and I can only say that I feel particularly sorry and sympathetic for Jack Elam and Dub Taylor that they, for whatever reason, found themselves inadvertently defamed a little of their fine reputations by having sadly included themselves into this mud-pumper.

212090,3,6300178161,"I like this movie. Come-on, Dennis Fimple is in it, he's a piece of work! And for the record, a previous reviewer had the names mismatched, Fimple played Pahoo, John David Carson was Rives.

Fimple kept pretty busy in the movie and TV business. You might recognize him most recently as Grandpa Hugo Firefly in Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses (2003), but he played small rolls in many movies over the years, and appeared in many TV show episodes, including ER, Quantum Leap, The A-Team, The Fall Guy, The Dukes of Hazard, and many others, even Petticoat Junction and Green Acres back in the late 60's. Sadly Dennis Fiimple passed away in August of 2002, of natural causes, shortly after finishing his work on House of 1000 Corpses.

John David Carson is a familiar face of film and television as well, having appeared in episodes of Hawaii Five-0, CHiPs, Charlies Angels, The Fall Guy, Eight is Enough, Barnaby Jones, and many others, including a small roll in the 1990 film Pretty Woman.

Carson plays the cool, good looking half of the duo, but Fimple has some sort of appeal, even though many might consider him less than attractive. Heck, one of the young vixens in the film even shows interest in him.

Jack Elam portrayed town drunk Joe Canton. Elam's career spanned 6 decades, beginning way back in 1944 with Trailin' West. You may remember him as the cooky-eyed Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing in The Canonball Run (1981), or from a host of other films and TV shows throughout the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. Elam passed away in October, 2003.

Creature from Black Lake is not the worst production I've seen, and once played out the story is actually pretty good. Fimple is cast perfectly for this roll, and creates a likeable character as Pahoo; comical, yet somehow vulnerable, and we find out how well this actually works at setting us up for a shock later in the film.

The creature noises are creepy enough, the scenes are shot well, and the acting is pretty good for the most part. It was originally shot in a widescreen format, cinemascope or something, because the version reproduced for the DVD features the infamous pan-and-scan trick to get characters into frame. Of course the title sequences are all squeezed in there in order to make all the words fit on a standard TV screen, so everything looks stretched and tall. Maybe someone will decide to release this again in a widescreen format on DVD.

Next to The Legend of Boggy Creek I'd have to say this is my favorite Bigfoot film of that era. In fact, aside from Harry and The Hendersons, which wasn't a thriller, any other Bigfoot movie I've seen was just okay. This movie has a certain quality about it which makes it fun to watch, entertaining and spooky at times.

If you're looking for a classic Bigfoot film, complete with eerie, dark, Louisiana bayou scenes, and a giant beast lurking in the shadows, I suggest you pick up The Creature from Black Lake. It's actually a pretty good film.",1170979200,3,2957,4.6513409961685825

I have heard some bad reviews about this film but you have to remember this film was done in  the 70's during the whole bigfoot rage. Most people know what they're in for when they get this film. A great popcorn movie that will scare the bejeezus out of you under the right conditions...lights off, quiet, and alone in the room. I highly recommend this film for a good fright. Just remember the film makers had a very small budget, but they pulled off a very convincing scary little flick. I would rate this film one star above boggy creek.",1166227200,2,690,4.390625

Black Lake and Boggy Creek are probably two of the best bigfoot films made so far(excluding yeti films like the Abominable Snowman with Peter Cushing).Not alot of blood and profanity. Just an entertaining little story. I would have added another star if it had been in widescreen and a better transfer. It almost looks like it's been copied from a vcr. The sound is pretty bad also. Not good quality at all, but that's all there is for now. Remember,this is a low budget 70s flick without the cgi,gore and profanity. I recommend it.",1153785600,,693,4.642276422764228

212094,3,6300178161,"I obtained this for Christmas, I had heard both Good and Bad things about this movie. This is nothing like The ""Legend of Boggy Creek"". It takes place in the swamps of loisiana where two college boys are a looking Bigfoot. The encounter many witnesses, as well as the town Sheiff who wants them to keep thier mouthes shut about the creature. This movie has it's ups and downs, there is not as much creature action in here as Boggy Creek. We actually get to see the creature up close, but note this truly depicts Sasquatch poorly.

As a massive fan of the mystery I feel that I should stick up for the big guy. NEVER, AND I MEAN NEVER, has there been any attack on a human, the creature in here is blood thirsty and likes to kill. Not like the gentle giants that they are, and yes I am a believer. This movie has a whole lot of suspense in it and keeps you on the edge of your seat. If your a Bigfoot fan such as myself I would see it. Be fore warned that it is no Boggy Creek however.",1107302400,5,984,4.072164948453608
212095,4,6300178161,"After having acquired the DVD version of ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"", a movie I enjoyed ""way back when"" (and find I still do), I noticed a lot of media association between it and this film, ""The Creature From Black Lake"". I also noticed ""Black Lake"" starred Jack Elam and Dub Taylor , two of the greatest character actors who ever worked in the film business . These connections made me purchase this movie.
  I am not sorry I did. Is this the be-all-and-end-all of scary movie making? No, it isn't. Is it a ""dud"", a ""stinker"", a waste of money and viewing time. No, it isn't THAT either!!!  It is a ""B"" picture, what used to be called a ""Drive-In Flick"" and an entertaining one at that.
  It was obviously inspired by ""Boggy Creek"". It begins with
the same kind of spooky photographic tour of creepy, desolate swamplands (both movies have turtles jumping off logs into the water). These are the opening credits sequences, alive with the
sounds of croaking bullfrogs and screeching waterfowl. VERY ""Boggy Creek"". Add to that the musical score , which was composed by the same composer who DID ""Boggy Creek"", Jaime Mendoza-Nava, and you get a very similar ""feel"" with the material.
  The difference in the two films is that ""Boggy"" is re-created , basically non-fictional docu-drama, whereas ""Black Lake"" is fiction based on alledged anecdotal fact. ""Lake"" uses no narration, as ""Boggy"" does, and moves along as a typical ""booger"" movie except for the fact that it really doesn't become truly frightening until close to the end.

  Jim McCullough and Joy Houck, Jr., the producer and director, respectively, have taken a cue from some classic old time movie directors like Val Lewton and learned that an audience has more empathy for characters in danger if they feel they KNOW these characters and have ""bonded"" with them, than if they are just ""faces"" to be stalked and slaughtered. The old masters knew you got more audience involvement, feelingwise, if ONE character you ""knew"" and ""liked"" was being terrorised upstairs in a house by a maniac than if 1,273 anonymous running individuals got stomped by Godzilla. That's how human psychology works.

  In this movie you are introduced to a gaggle of pretty likeable characters early on; two University of Chicago cryptozoology students (Dennis Fimple and John David Carson), a cranky local sheriff with little time or patience with monster foolishness, cute eye-candy girls and colorful locals...some of whom have SEEN the ""booger"". A great deal of the movie is likeably amusing, somewhat comical, only mildly frightening. This is the ""set up"" part of the film, the part which engages you with the characters. It comprises about the first 80% of the movie. Then ""Black Lake"" takes a sharp turn into frightfulness and becomes quite brutal and nerve-wracking. It turns into the scary thing the promos claimed it was, and it does so very effectively. The mechanical and make-up effects are quite good for a low budget effort and the acting is decent all the way around. Elam and Taylor, of course, are superb, but Fimple and Carson as the students are good in their roles as well. The only quibble I have with Fimple's character, ""Pahoo"", is that he is supposed to be a Vietnam vet and he comes closer to depicting a beardless ""Shaggy Rogers"" without a Scooby Doo. The sense of weaponscraft and camp security a real such ex-warrior would realistically possess are just not there. The two young leads are told this is a vicious killing thing, but they go after it with only one weapon and at a crucial plot turn it is found to be  not loaded. They ""forgot"". A typical Hollywood plot device...utterly unbelievable...that serves no purpose than to set up a dangerous confrontation that puts the principals in jeopardy.

  Despite some plot holes like this (which almost ALL ""B"" pictures are encumbered with) ""Black Lake"" moves along pretty darn well and ultimately satisfies. I think some reviewers want high-tension, blood-and-guts savagery thoughout the movie (like ""Jason"" or ""The Creeper"" might provide them) and this one isn't structured that way. Taken as a whole, though, it is a nice little ""old school"" chiller that is well worth watching.",1105315200,14,4193,4.891396332863188

It is recommended by many fans of Boggy Creek. SO I end up paying more than I should to have ""Creature"" in my DVD collection. I had never seen the film before it arrived in the mail. It was just terrible, not even good on a campy level. Frankly, I feel it was a waste of money, there were so many other movies I had been wanting yet instead bought this BOMB.  Don't let the reviews foil you. It is awful. It is unintentionally funny (the acting). And frankly, if I could, I would get my money back from Amazon and send this DVD back.

This definitely is not one of Joy Houck's better efforts as a filmmaker, Brain Machine and Gray Matter were much more cool, although kind of similar to each other.  Anyway on the plus side though, this film has excellent special effects and make up, with a very realistic looking Bigfoot.

Essentially ""Creature From Black Lake"" is about two young anthropologists who are given a grant to go look for a bigfoot type creature in Louisiana. Along the way there is lots of corny segments involving girls and a run-in with the law. In the end they manage to track down bigfoot and end up in a bid for survival.
There is really only one good thing about this movie - Dean Cundy does a great job of the cinematography. Apart from that it is extremely cheesy and is only for bigfoot completists that must have everything.

212144,4,6300178161,"""Creature From Black Lake"" (a.k.a. ""Demon of the Lake"") is one of a string of ""Bigfoot"" inspired low-budget horror flicks made in the Seventies.  This when is set down in the Louisiana bayou country where a couple of anthropology students from Chicago named Rives (Dennis Fimple) and Pahoo (John David Carson) show up to search for the local creature (their professor thought this would be a good idea).  The boys immediately get on the bad side of the local Sheriff (Billy Thurman) whose name is, I swear, Billy Carter (the film came out in 1976, which is the year Jimmy Carter was elected but still before the ""Billy Beer"" period of his time in the White House).  Things get worse when the young students find a couple of local gals to have some fun with; of course, one of them turns out to be the sheriff's daughter.  Meanwhile, all the older folks in town keep muttering things about the creature.  This explains why the ""stars"" of this film are the veteran character actors Jack Elam as Joe Canton and Dub Taylor as Grandpa Bridges.  Eventually the guys wander off into the wood and darn if they do not meet up with a creature out in the Black Lake area.
As you might suspect, this a film where the chills come from strange noises in the woods, because once the creature actually shows up there is going to come a point where we get a good look at it and the bubble is going to burst.  Fortunately it is a brief look and does not do too much harm to the climax.  ""Creature From Black Lake"" does get points for capturing local color, since it was filmed in Louisiana, which just means the locals playing the locals add some authenticity to the film.  The hand-held camera approach works in the film's favor as well.  Elam and Taylor have fun playing those crazy old coots that kept them employed for several decades (Elam wants to get his shotgun and turn the creature into a rug), always threatening to take the film over the top, but that is to be expected.  In terms of Bigfoot movies ""Creature From Black Lake"" is not as good as ""Legend of Boggy Creek,"" but maybe a bit better than ""Sasquatch.""  Depends on how much you like movies where the creature is out there, just beyond the light of your campfire.  Overall, not a bad little Seventies B-movie for this genre.  Note: director Joy N. Houck Jr. plays Professor Burch.",1046563200,13,2330,4.490521327014218
7803644,3,6300178161,"This is a 1976 low budget horror film about two college students who travel to the Louisiana swamps to investigate the story of a trapper who claims that a Bigfoot-type creature has killed his friend. Upon arrival, they are greeted by an almost obstinate silence by the local people and have a couple of run-ins with the sheriff before they finally find the person they are looking for. They go to the site where the trapper claims to have had his experience, only to end up a fight for survival. In spite of this, the majority of the cinematic time is spent in the voyage of self-discovery and developing friendship of the college students, with not a lot of action until the end. The cast includes the old western star Jack Elam, and several character actors from both television and film backgrounds.

7803646,3,6300178161,"I was, at first, pretty thrilled to see this old film again, after 42 years, and it still holds a certain charm even today.  Produced in the mid-1970s (when public interest in UFOs, Bigfoot and swamp monsters was really starting to peak), this film followed in the shadow of the wildly successful ""Legend of Boggy Creek"" and has a beaucoup of Boggy Creek overtones.

In this one, a couple of devil-may-care Chicago university students travel to upstate Louisiana to investigate a legendary swamp monster that is atypically much more violent than your garden variety Bigfoot.  It's actually killing people.

When they arrive, a stereotypical Deep South Sheriff warns the students against ""getting folks all worked up,"" because this sleepy community takes the monster legend quite seriously and the locals deliberately stopped discussing ""the creature"" anymore to avoid further angst.

Whereupon, the two nosey students immediately proceed to whip the sleepy community into a frenzy, repeatedly incurring the wrath of the sheriff and eventually incurring the wrath of ""the creature"" itself.  It seems to take forever.

Most surprising is the level of acting in this low-budget B-grade flick.  The principle actors do a fairly decent (if hammed-up) job, while two of the supporting actors (longtime film veterans Dub Taylor and Jack Elam) knock the ball out of the park in their own inimitable styles.

It's almost worth the ride just to watch Taylor and Elam in their sporadic appearances.

Unfortunately, the climax of the film occurs at night, in the swamp, such that we can't really discern the sub-par monster effects (except to note that it's just a guy running around in a gilly suit).

With a little more expenditure and creativity in giving the monster a truly monstrous presence, I seriously think ""Creature from Black Lake"" could've been another ""Legend of Boggy Creek.""

Alas, it's not.  So, only 3 stars.",1520985600,,1914,5.135483870967742
