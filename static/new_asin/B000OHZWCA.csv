This film should have received a wider distribution. the access the filmmaker has is amazing and Philadelphia must be a cesspool like Chicago.",1321315200,,265,4.782608695652174
8366401,5,B000OHZWCA,"This is truly a documentary that feels like it is actually a movie!!!! It really shows how treacherous big city politics can be and the filmmaker had incredible access to the candidates!!!!! I saw the doc ""Street Fight"" but in my opinion this is far better. It is a cautionary tale of politicians manipulating the process and how the public buys it just like a herd of sheep!! See this film!! It is a non-fictional work of art!!!",1198972800,3,429,4.512820512820513
8366402,5,B000OHZWCA,"Outstanding documentary!  Every citizen of Philadelphia should own a copy.  Very effectively depicts John Street and fellow Democrats as blatent racists and liars, as well as local electrician honcho and his bullying goons as the unofficial leader of organized crime in the city.  Brilliant!",1188432000,4,291,5.568181818181818
