8229045,5,B000XPXUSG,"In February of 1996, VISIONARY CINEMA covered a production called WOLVY, created by makeup/creature artist Todd Tucker. Using Hollywood experts, a ten-minute featurette was shot over a two-day period on San Fernando Valley sound stages. VISIONARY CINEMA 's Scott Essman and crew were on hand to create a documentary of the production.  The final product is this rare 24-minute DVD.

Tucker spent years researching and designing the six characters for the show, then created them in his free time using the skills which got him key jobs on films such as ""The Mask,"" ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" and ""Thinner."" Among his characters are a seven-foot-tall, four-armed, childlike abominable snowman named Gus, a pair of monstrous body-guards named the Thug Brothers, and a marsupial wrestling manager named Willie Weasel. The live-action comic book footage was edited and planned as a feature film project.

Todd's story centers around the lead character Wolvy, a cocky, flamboyant, upright, wrestling werewolf. It seems that Wolvy must wrestle Baby Mulligan before he is challenged to a big match by Gus. The focus of the project, according to Todd, is about fun and comedy, but he hopes for a slightly adult sense of humor amidst the chaos of his oversized wrestling characters.

Featured in this documentary are detailed step-by-step behind-the-scenes account of the special makeup effects, animatronic creatures and full-body costumes realized for this project.  Additionally, on-set footage details the entire filming process.  Bonuses include interviews with Tucker and his key production crew, and comments by Academy Award-winning makeup artist Greg Cannom.",1193184000,2,1649,5.4980237154150196
