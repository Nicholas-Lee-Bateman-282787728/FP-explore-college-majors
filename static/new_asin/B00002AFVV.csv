7915575,4,B00002AFVV,"If you remember the Blondie and Dagwood film in which Penny Singleton sings the lovely song 'Trees' with a boys choir -- this is it.  The movie is worth having for that performance alone.  It's a cute film, but Penny's and the kids' beautiful rendition is the highlight of the movie. Five stars for the music, three stars for the whole movie.",1326585600,,342,4.5
7915576,5,B00002AFVV,"Dagwood returns home to find the Chief of Police and bank officials waiting for him. Someone forged Dagwood's name to a check! Dagwood loaned $50 to an old friend, and Blondie made a mistake. There is a big argument. Dagwood will see his old friend and get his money back. Instead of the money Dagwood gets a show dog that has a pedigree. Big dogs have big appetites. When Dagwood visits a prospective client he finds a willing buyer for Chin-Up. [The bills tell about the value of a dollar then.] Back at the office a customer makes a deal with Mr. Dithers: keep Dagwood's dog out of the contest and he'll hire Dither's company for his factory construction. [In those days factories were being built instead of being shut down and shipped offshore.] Poor Dagwood has lost his job because the Great Dane chewed up the factory blueprints. Blondie has ordered a new washing machine. The veterinarian calls Blondie with the news about Chin-Up. Her dreams are shattered, and she consults a lawyer for advice.

Blondie sees a newspaper ad for a dog show. There is a $500 prize. She also discovers a song will affect Chin-Up. [This shows her singing voice, rarely heard in this series.] Dagwood has to heat up water for his Sunday bath. There are some comic scenes here. Mr. Dithers uses his Packard station wagon to take the Bumsteads to the dog show. The plot about the dog is funny and too complicated to easily describe. Chin-Up responds to a song, so Blondie sings, and the dog perks up to impress the judges. The grand prize has a number of claimants, a small riot breaks out. The conflicts are resolved, Blondie wins at the end.

This film shows life as viewed by Hollywood. It is a lesson about lending money to acquaintances. This series often shows Dagwood as a grown child. What are the politics in this viewpoint?",1184803200,,1819,4.611111111111111
7915577,2,B00002AFVV,"Dagwood (Arthur Lake) comes home to find the police waiting for him.  Someone has forged Dagwood's signature on his check.  But as it turns out Dagwood did it himself to get paid back.  Now you know why they call him Dagwood.  Blondie (Penny Singleton) sure is upset.  Alvin (Danny Mummert) drops by and lets Blondie know he heard the argument all the way in his house.  Baby Dumpling (Larry Simms) and Alvin begin to use slang, much to the disapproval of Blondie.  Dagwood buys a show dog that causes havoc in the Bumstead house.  This film does not use the early previews, but the theme song is used this time.  The mailman in the film is hiding in the tree this time and we all know why.  William Frawley plays a dog owner.  This role was 10 years before the ""I Love Lucy"" tv series.  This film, perhaps, is a bit unpleasant at times. Too much serious Bumstead arguing and yelling.  Bad writing and directing.  But you might like this one if you are a dog lover.  The next film in the series is BLONDIE GOES TO COLLEGE.",1062201600,,1022,4.361702127659575
