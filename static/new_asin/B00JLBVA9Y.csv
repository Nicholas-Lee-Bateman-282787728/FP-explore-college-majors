8652067,1,B00JLBVA9Y,Doesn't work in the US. Pay attention and find out which region you are in. I had no idea this would be an issue. They refuse to give me a refund because of this!,1500595200,,162,3.7941176470588234
8652068,1,B00JLBVA9Y,Item didn't properly identify that it was not a US region code. Now I can't play it or return it because of this. And the seller claims they made sure it was properly labeled,1487289600,4,174,4.147058823529412
8652069,1,B00JLBVA9Y,"Sometimes a deal can be too good to be true.  Such was the case with this purchase.  I didn't realize that this collection was coming from the UK, and was therefore a set of region 2 DVDs.

So, when the package eventually arrived, I opened it eagerly to finally begin my Veronica Mars education.  The discs wouldn't play.  There are no known hacks for my bluray players.  I am faced with the devil's own choice: try to sell this brand new set as used to recoup a bit of my loss, or double down and give Amazon MORE money to buy a region free player????  The language in my living room has been COLORFUL, friends.",1447891200,12,612,4.269565217391304
