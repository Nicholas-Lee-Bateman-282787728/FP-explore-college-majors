8282178,2,B001B81VQW,"The quality of the DVD was very poor, but what I didn't like it was that one scene jumped abruptly to another one, losing the coherence of the movie. I had to return the copy even though the seller was nice enough to send me another copy, but the second one was worse than the first one. I understand that the movie is old,  I would have wanted to know whether the DVD was remastered before buying. I have bought other copies from Televisa and Columbia House through Amazon.com recently and they were remastered and the quality of the copies were great. Unfortunately, they don't have most of Cantinflas' movies. Very sorry to write this bad review but I was not happy with it, it looked like it was copied from the VHS as is without editing. I suppose it wouldn't be the same thing for new movies for this seller, sadly I had back luck with this. I would like to indicate though that the seller was nice enough in sending me a second copy, and when I told him that the copy was not good, he did make the refund immediately.",1350345600,,1024,4.305699481865285
8282179,3,B001B81VQW,"The video disc I purchased from Palacio Musical has bee released under 2 titles. Since I own one already, I requested an exchange or credit from the vendor. In reply I received a rude response indicating my ""ignorance"".
I wish to pursue this no further, so I'll keep the product to give as a gift. Nevertheless, I am greatly disappointed in Palacio Musical's treatment of customers.",1227571200,,382,4.803030303030303
