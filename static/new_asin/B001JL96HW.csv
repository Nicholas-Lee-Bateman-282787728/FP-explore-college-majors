8313119,5,B001JL96HW,"These are just fun and classic. No gore, and the things that were important back then are obsolete now, but you can still relate to the people's angst and problems on certain levels. No curse words either!",1369353600,2,205,4.5675675675675675
8313120,5,B001JL96HW,"This entertaining ""bunco squad"" police series ran for 3 seasons from 1951-1953, and though there were almost 100 episodes, less than half of them are currently available on DVD.  Besides this, the manufacturer Alpha Home Entertainment only releases 4 episodes per DVD, and the shows do not run consecutively.  For this Racket Squad Volume 4, you will find the following shows:

CASE OF THE CONDEMNED CATTLE, Season 2, 1951, Episode 16, Show #29
with Dolores Mann, James Bush

TWO FOR ONE, Season 2, 1951, Episode 9, Show #22

CASE OF THE MATCHMAKER, Season 2, 1952, Episode 29, Show #42

8313121,5,B001JL96HW,"This is one of the best old TV series. At least as far as 1950's 'cop and robber' shows went. And that says a lot because there were lots of them! I grew up watching them all (as fast as I could turn two channels - that's all we had). 'The Naked City' was good too, but the prices are still high on those. These are great bargains...and if I'm not mistaken...based on true stories.",1248307200,5,381,4.093333333333334
