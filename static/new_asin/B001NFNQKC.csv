The plot? Well, here goes;
Puffy, irritated Joe Don Baker plays a Confederate officer seeing his poorly dressed ""soldiers"" (complete with 20th century eyeglasses) get their collective cans whooped by them dern Yanks to the tune of ""The Night they Drove Ol' Dixie Down"" by The Band (I'm not kidding here). Miffed, he comforts his dying pard played by a hopefully well paid Slim Pickens who tells him about diamonds hidden in a cave. Agitated, he visits his wife, beats up her ""new"" husband (Wifey thought Joe Don was dead), and takes his trusty Native American scout and Jesus Christ: Superstar Ted Neely to find the diamonds. Ticked off, Joe Don 'n crew stumble across a catatonic Sondra Locke, get occasional arrows shot at them, run across ""bushwackers""...ewww, and hear tales of how ""scary"" this mountain is where the cave is suppose to be.

Whew!

Anyhoo, what is a somewhat interesting idea is torn asunder by the poor production values and obvious quick shooting schedule which results in a very poorly photographed film. Meaning it's hard to tell just what is going on at times, which undercuts the ""spooky"" atmosphere generated by the forest they are travelling through. The acting by just about everyone is over the top (save for Ted who seems rather laid back) and Joe Don's character is so unlikable that you don't care what happens to him. In addition, while I'll be nice and not give away who/what/whatever is behind the ""curse"", I will say that's it's pretty easy to guess halfway into this mess. And how one character does come to that realization is so vague it doesn't really make any sense. As well as the murky, confusing ending, but at that point only a collective apology from the cast/crew/producers would suffice.

It doesn't help that the versions of this film released on DVD/VHS are the truncated ""tv versions"" with the bad words removed and some severe editing chops that result in some ""jumping ahead"" that makes it even tougher to watch at times.

In fact, I would've completely passed on reviewing this for Amazon except I saw the hilarious ""Editor Review"" above which was probably written by whoever stands to make a profit from this ""film"". So perhaps I'm doing him a favor by reviewing it as any attention is probably too much.

""Curse of Demon Mountain"" is the worst kind of bad film, one that wastes a potentially good idea. I think any remake can only be an improvement.

Tidbits:
- This film has at least nine different titles, a pretty good sign that it sucks.

- The film is preceded by a title card stating that diamonds have been found in the Ozarks before.

- This was Ted Neely's following film after ""Jesus Christ: Superstar""...my how the mighty have fallen.

- Sondra Locke participated in this film just before making ""The Gauntlet"", where she had a notable topless scene. Here, you get to see her naked back which is about the only thing nice to look at in the entire picture.

- It's clear that the confrontation with the bushwackers, which happens about 2/3rds the way through the film was shot last as there is considerable snow on the ground. Snow that wasn't present before and completely disappears in the next scene.",1269907200,6,3332,4.707903780068729
