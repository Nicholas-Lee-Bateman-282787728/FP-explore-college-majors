1425374,5,B00005BJOJ,"Is this a great movie?  Well no, but it's a fun movie, and definitely one to enjoy on a hot summer day, just like I did back in the early 80's when I caught this movie on HBO.  If you're a fan of Tony Danza or Orangutans, then this movie is for you.  The orangutans steal the movie, as well as the goofy, madcap villains trying to steal them.  An absolute treat from start to finish.",1374451200,,383,4.0
1425375,5,B00005BJOJ,"If you want to see Tony Danza in his prime and in all his sexiness then this movie is for you.  Even if you don't find it funny you can lust over a young Tony Danza as he wears tight t-shirts that show off his sexy muscles.  Stallone called himself the ""Italian Stallone"" but Tony Danza was my crush growing up.  He was tall, dark, and handsome!!! The big bonus is that there is a scene wear you can see Tony running around in his tighty whities (yeah remember those days?).  I only wish they had this on DVD.  $35-45 is a little too much to see some beef cake. Somebody put this on YouTube.com.",1343088000,,595,4.139130434782609

7937989,4,B00005BJOJ,Loved this crazy flick when I was a kid. (I'm 40 now). None of my friends have seen this movie. It's not cinematic gold but I think there's a few laughs to be had. Plus seeing a very young Tony Danza and Danny Devito was nostalgic.,1505520000,,231,4.043478260869565

7937994,5,B00005BJOJ,This movie changed my life. Soon after watching i bought an orangutan and moved him in with me.  I taught him to drive and smoke cigarettes.  We are both planning on voting Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Thanks GOING APE!,1454371200,2,231,4.609756097560975
7937995,5,B00005BJOJ,Very funny movie but no dvd.,1434931200,,28,3.8333333333333335
7937996,5,B00005BJOJ,Good family comedy with twists and turns. Good  acting from two very good actors ( Tony Danza and Danny DeVto )  And who doesn't love a group of highly intelligent & mischievious  monkeys.  A movie  that is entertaining  and  does not need to be edited for children.,1417392000,2,266,4.531914893617022

7937998,1,B00005BJOJ,"Some movies not as good as they seemed at first view. This is one of them. A few weak laughs from the animals antics, but really lame story and Danny DeVito is obnoxious and not funny at all.",1405296000,,191,4.052631578947368
