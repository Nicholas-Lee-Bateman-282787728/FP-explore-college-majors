I'm wondering if Van Morrison gave permission for the use of Into The Mystic, especially given that you're watching a couple of kids shoot up while the song plays out.  Warners owned his record contract then, so he may not have had a say.",1464220800,,384,4.787878787878788

8367050,4,B002EAYDXE,"I got the movie mainly because I was curious to see Billy Gray in something other then ""Father Knows Best"".  It turned out be a great movie about drug abuse, but really Gray stood out as a drug dealer.  I heard he played the role so real that people thought he really did sell drugs.  He always reminded me a little of James Dean.  I recommend it especially if you want to see him play a role other then Bud.",1345334400,4,408,4.0625
8367051,2,B002EAYDXE,"This quasi-documentary about users and hustlers in L.A. circa 1970 simply goes nowhere.  The film's constructed around a series of vignettes concerning denizens of the drug scene but for the life of me I learned very little about them or why they use.  Director Floyd Mutrux employs real people instead of actors for the most part and they weren't very interesting.  If the flick is supposed to engender sympathy for them then Mutrux has missed the mark by a large margin.  If you want to see a film that offers real insight about the drug scene check out ""A Panic in Needle Park"" starring a young Al Pacino.  Film's sole virtue is a decent soundtrack of rock chestnuts.  Which leads to the question as to when they're going to release Mutrux' ""American Hot Wax"" to disc.  Definitely a relic that hasn't aged well.",1248998400,4,814,4.65034965034965
