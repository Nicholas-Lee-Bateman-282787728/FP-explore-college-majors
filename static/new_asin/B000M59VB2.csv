8166339,5,B000M59VB2,This is a great Study promoting an incredible Historical Figure (The life of Jesus).  This study has done justice to the Christian message.  It is written in a most credible way. David Watson's life has been used more so in his death because of this video series. I recommend this as a study for any group to use.,1365897600,,313,4.379310344827586
8166340,1,B000M59VB2,"I ordered this video thinking it was the collection of shows from the BBC ""First Light"" series, written by N. T. (""Tom"") Wright, as he describes in his book ""The Original Jesus.""  In his book, Wright says the first part of this popular book (Part 1 of which is entitled 'Jesus--Then and Now') is ""a slightly fuller version of what appeared on television.""

This video is definitely not that.  It is a series of apologetic interviews from a decidedly conservative, evangelical standpoint.  They are reasonably professional, but dated (by clothing and hair styles), and in any event, not what I wanted.",1243123200,,600,4.910891089108911
