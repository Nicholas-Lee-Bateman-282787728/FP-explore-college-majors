8494802,5,B0068JD7KC,"The actual dvd did not work on my player. I contacted the seller who was extremely helpful directing me to try using it on my computer. As I was having my computer worked on I was able to have it made to take the dvd so that I could view the product. The actual dvd was too thick( 2 x as thick as a regular dvd) but works fine in my computer. I had several emails from the company in europe that mailed the product and they were extremely helpful and courteous.  (even signed off with ""kindest regards"". so unlike many companies we deal with in this country.  Yeah Philip!!!!",1360195200,3,575,4.218181818181818
