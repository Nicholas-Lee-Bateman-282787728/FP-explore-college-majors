1888828,5,B00009RDGY,"THREE WORLDS is a stunningly dramatic film directed by Catherine Corsini who co-wrote the story and screenplay with Benot Graffin in collaboration with Antoine Jaccoud and Lise Macheboeuf - a film that approaches several poignant subjects that all weave together to make this a study in human responsibility from birth to death. The acting is extraordinary, the pacing exactly on mark, the cinematography by Claire Mathon enhances the themes, the subtle musical score by Gr&eacute;goire Hetzel underlines the tension, and the lessons it presents and drives home make is one of the more important social statements before the public today. And additional credit should be given to Film Movement for bringing it to our attention.

Al (the very fine Raphal Personnaz) is an attractive young man who has risen from the lower stratum of French society to become the co-owner of an automobile firm owned by the shifty but wealthy Testard (Jean-Pierre Malo) and is due to be married to the Testard's daughter Marion (Ad&egrave;le Haenel) in 10 days. Out celebrating one evening with his friends and fellow workers Franck (Reda Kateb) and Martin (Alban Aumard) Al is the perpetrator of a hit and run accident, critically injuring a Moldavian pedestrian, a scene that is witnessed by the pregnant Juliette (Clotilde Hesme), a woman struggling with her own problems of relationship with the baby's philosophy professor father Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric (Laurent Capelluto) who calls 911 to the scene.  Al is terrified of his actions, but is convinced by his friends to ignore the situation: after all, the victim is merely an illegal immigrant. Juliette is wrought with empathy, discovers the victim's name, meets the victim's wife Vera (Arta Dobroshi) and the two women bond. Al is so disturbed by his action that he visits the hospital where the victim is in ICU and is seen by Juliette who then sets about to find Al to ask him to do the right thing - turn himself in to the police or at least give money to Vera who is without funds to pay for her husband's care. The plot becomes more complex as Al and Juliette are drawn together  - Juliette is the only person with whom he can share and admit his guilt. Juliette is then placed in a position of intermediary between the critically wounded husband of Vera, Vera's Moldavian `family' and Al. How the situation resolves - including the consequences of Al's moves with his boss and his finance and his encounters with Vera and her `family' and the death of Vera's husband forms the closure of this powerful film.

There is a scene in a classroom where Juliette's husband is teaching philosophy that quotes Martin Heidegger, a German philosopher known for his existential and phenomenological explorations of the ""question of Being"" who Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric quotes as saying `the only thing we truly own is our death'.  It is a poignant moment that allows the rest of the film's themes to gel. This is a superb film worthy of wide attention. Grady Harp, August 13",1375315200,10,3003,4.950396825396825
1888829,4,B00009RDGY,"Let me state upfront that I am a big fan of the Film Movement library of foreign and indie films, so much so that I finally gave in last year and became a member of their ""DVD of the Month"" club. This is the May, 2013 release in that on-going series.

""Three Worlds"" (2012 release from France; 100 min.) brings the story of three people who as a result of one horrible event get interconnected in the most unlikely of ways. In the first world, there is Al (played by Raphal Personnaz), a thirty-something up-and-comer at a luxury car dealership and who is about to marry the daughter of the dealership owner. One night Al is out late with co-workers and while driving home, he is careless (using his mobile) and hits a man at full speed. The man is badly hurt but after stepping out, Al is terrified and flees the scene. Second there is Juliette (played by Clotilde Hesme), a twenty-something young lady who is pregnant with the child of her guy-friend with whom she is not getting along well anymore. By chance, Juliette is staring out her window as the accident happens and she witnesses the whole thing. Third there is Vera (Arta Dobroshi), a woman immigrant from Moldova and married to the man overrun by Al. To tell you much more of the plot-heavy movie would surely ruin your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this is a heavy-duty dramatic movie that raises a lot of good points about guilt, remorse, and personal responsability. At one point, Al starts to understand the desparate position that he is getting in/already is in, and it overwhelms him, crying out ""I've always tried to do the right thing!"" I thought that writer-director Catherine Corsini did an excellent job shaping the characters in the movie, walking a fine line between bringing drama but never becoming melodramatic. Next, there is a secondary theme in the movie pertaining to illegal immigrants in France (in this case: a Moldovian community in Paris). Separate and apart from how one feels about illegal immgration, Corsini makes the point that these people are humans too. Last, the movie brings some great performances. For me Raphal Personnaz in the role of Al is the breakout role of the movie, and I think we have not seen the last of him.

As always, the DVD-of-the-Month comes with a bonus shortie. This month brings an excellent 14 min. feature called ""The Piano Tuner"", in which the main character pretends to be blind (for reasons too long to explain here) and then at one point witnesses something horrible. What can he do? Watch! Meanwhile, if you are in the mood for a top notch foreign movie which is surprisingly accessible despite its heavy undercurrent, you cannot go wrong with ""Three Worlds"". HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1369353600,,2792,4.7407407407407405
1888830,5,B00009RDGY,"Anthropologist Steve Lansing presents his take on the culture/religion/life of the people of South Bali in Indonesia. He illustrates examples of the way art ties into spiritual beliefs in such a way as to become part of the lives of nearly everyone.

Most interesting is his brief look at the rice farming cycle and its ties to temple calendars. Lansing had been studying in Bali for over ten years, at the time of the misguided Green Revolution, and he was instrumental in convincing officials that the Balinese rice cycle, while it appeared to be ""superstition"", was actually a masterwork of sustainable agriculture. He documents this in more detail in his book ""The Goddess and the Computer"".

After a brief, intense look at Balinese history, the film focuses on the way the people balance the ""three worlds"" -- heaven, earth, and the underworld -- by preserving ancient traditions while permitting and even incorporating modern technology into their ways of life. A pemungkah seminarian recites lontar poetry, the village temple of Batuan puts on an evening performance of the ""Gambuh"" classical drama, puppeteers enact the adventures of the gods and demons, and the entire island gears up for the spectacular Eka Desa Rudra festival. Held only once every hundred years, this ceremony purifies demonic energy into higher forms, keeping the three worlds safe.

This captivating documentary should be preserved on DVD. It does not present the full facts on Balinese culture, but it is a splendid introduction.",1238025600,,1511,5.159183673469387

1888866,5,B00009RDGY,"This is a powerful look into the influences of guilt  as they're explored here in a way very reminiscent of the approach to the stages of grief,  without coming off didactic. In this excellent film, the story's potential for high emotionality, which might have easily taken over, is reined in just enough to allow the viewer to stay focused and inquisitive throughout.  It's such a specific theme, with all elements funneling that focus, that too much said would be a spoiler.  Our ride takes us through emotions ranging from disdain to fear to heart-rending compassion and empathy, one merging into another and none experienced as discrete. And that keeps us engaged. Al's (Personnaz) angst builds and gains intensity like a storm gathers wind; transforming more and more into action. Juliette's involvement is at first acute, pulls back, then evolves into full immersion. This pacing is exceptional.  Applause for the compelling writing by Catherine Corsini, the skillful directing by Corsini and Graffin, and the exquisite acting by Raphael Personnaz and Clotilde Hesme!",1464912000,6,1073,5.251461988304094

1888886,4,B00009RDGY,"We watched Three Worlds (original title: ""Trois mondes""), a taut, well-plotted French drama conceived by writer/director Catherine Corsini, as part of the Film Movement subscription service.  It's a great way to see foreign films that don't often get a fair chance here in the US.  That's certainly the case for Three Worlds: it never got a chance here, playing only in one theater.  Now's your opportunity to see it in video or, better still, Amazon Instant Video release.  It's compelling watching well worth your time.

The cast here is first rate, starting with the beautiful and talented Clotilde Hesme, who made me a fan with her winsome, girl-next-door performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Grocer-s-Son-English-Subtitled/dp/B004HZ47BC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Grocer's Son (English Subtitled)</a>.  Then, we have Raphal Personnaz, the ill-fated center antagonist/protagonist who panics and flees after a hit-and-run and spends the rest of the film attempting to salve his wracked conscience.  He's definitely a personnaz of interest in my book after seeing this film.  [Yeah, couldn't wait to use that lame joke.]

The film's ""third world"" is fleshed out by Arta Dobroshi as Vera.  This striking Kosovan actress plays a Moldovan immigrant to Paris.  Her world and that of Al's (Personnaz's character) are brought together brutally by the accident in which Vera's husband is mowed down in the street.  The glue between the two is Juliette - witness to the incident - who forms unlikely relationships with each side of the triangle.

You won't rest a moment while watching this film.  It starts with a super high energy scene of drunken ""boys' night out"" revelry and never lets up.  And, about that scene: hats off to Reda Kateb here for his portrayal of Al's friend and co-worker, Franck.  He brings a level of malevolence and intimidation here adds a extra shot or two of tension to every scene in which he appears.  [Check him out in Jacques Audiard's astonishing masterpiece,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Prophet-Un-proph-te/dp/B003ULW5H2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Prophet (Un proph?te)</a>.]",1420848000,2,2215,5.850467289719626
1888887,3,B00009RDGY,"""Three Worlds"" (""Trois mondes"") starts with a hit and run accident, but Catherine Corsini's latest film is not exactly a crime thriller. The film's complicated story unfolds more like a character study, and we are to take a closer look at the psychological changes in humans in unusual situations.

Young and handsome Al (Raphal Personnaz) is getting married to a wealthy company owner's daughter in ten days. He thinks his future is so bright until he, while driving car while under influence of liquor, gets involved with an accident that severely injures Adrian (Rasha Bukvic), an illegal immigrant from Moldova. Terrified, Al immediately leaves the scene of the accident without trying to help. His friends (who were in the car) persuade him not to go to the police.

It is Juliette (Clotilde Hesme) who witnessed the accident and called 911. In a rather contrived fashion (that I would not reveal here) Juliette establishes an emotional bond with the victim's wife Vera (Arta Dobroshi), and Al the victimizer, too, though Vera doesn't know it.

Three characters representing three worlds, or social terrain of contemporary France, consist of the main story that seems a bit artificial. All players did superb jobs in playing these characters that have their own social backgrounds, problems to solve, and reality to face.

I think I understand the film's point, but because of the melodramatic storyline and I just find it hard to take it seriously. The film is worth a look, though, for the fine performances from the leads.",1379548800,,1530,5.0355731225296445
1888888,4,B00009RDGY,"The fourth entry in the Film on Friday series is from Catherine Corsini, a French director . Three Worlds was an 2012 official selection for both the Cannes and Toronto International Film Festival, as well as others.

 A night carousing with two friends in the days leading up to his wedding irrevocably changes Al's life and that of two other women. While speeding through the streets with his attention on his cellphone, Al doesn't see the pedestrian - until he hits him. Stunned, he gets out of the car to see what has happened, but at the urging of his two friends they leave the scene. Unbeknownst to him, Juliette, who lives in apartment above, has witnessed the accident. Shaken, she cannot identify the car or the man to the police. She is unable to let it go and tracks down the victim's wife, Vera. Vera and her husband are illegal immigrants from Moldavia. Al, feeling guilty, sneaks into the hospital and is spotted by Juliette. She realizes he's the one...

 Corsini gives us three distinct views of the outcome of Al's actions. Al has everything to lose, does not want to admit culpability, yet his guilt starts to eat away at him, eroding the carefully built life he has made. Raphael Personnaz plays his role well.  I didn't like Al at all - Personnaz's portrayal of the character's initial swaggering and the crumbling and unravelling that followed were believable.

 Vera and her family present the harsh reality of illegal immigrants. The hospital is after someone to pay the bills. Vera must go to work the day her husband is operated on. The scene in the hospital with the doctors is especially powerful. Vera is played by Arta Dobroshi. She captured the mercurial tone of Vera that vacillated between sadness and anger, hurt and strength, friendship and loathing. She is the character I empathized with the most.

 And caught between the two in a predicament of her own making is Juliet, played by Clotilde Hesme who has made herself a friend to Vera and a confidante and more to Al. She puzzled me the most - her actions towards both are well meant, but with Al she strays into dangerous territory.

 The supporting cast is somewhat predictable, with the heavy handed boss, the obnoxious friends, and the grasping, clinging girlfriend, but they all do an admirable job.

 As viewers we can see the immediate effects of that single action. We can see things getting steadily worse as the principles compound and complicate the situation with yet another misstep. Where does our sympathy and empathy lie? Each of the three suffers a loss - physically and emotionally. Three Worlds is an excellent exploration of a moral dilemma. The camera action was good, the settings realistic and the sound track suited. Definitely recommended watching.

 The bonus short film included - The Piano Tuner - was also excellent. A young man pretends to be blind. While on a job, he sees something he shouldn't have...

1888889,4,B00009RDGY,"`Three Worlds' is a 100 minute French film with English subtitles. It deals with the problems of 3 sets of people after a hit and run accident. Lies and troubles build upon each other.
The acting is good, but yet there is an emotional disconnect from the characters and then there is also the clich of an unexpected, inappropriate coupling. There are still the questions that occur of what is the value of another life compared to one who might lose their place in society and their money

The DVD also contains a most interesting short 14 minute film, `The Piano Tuner'. It is, in a way more spellbinding than the main feature. A musician becomes a piano tuner, but in order to gain more business pretends to be blind.
There are also extras of biographies of the 4 main featured players and the movie trailer.
This is a DVD for those who appreciate modern foreign films.

1888890,4,B00009RDGY,"Catherine Corsini's Three Worlds (2012) examines the aftermath of a hit and run accident, focusing on three parties, the driver, a witness, and the victim's wife and family.  It's an interesting story that doesn't follow conventional lines, as a tragic event draws a number of people together.

Alan Sheffer (Raphael Personnaz) is a car salesman in Paris, and after a night of partying with a couple his coworkers, he accidentally hits a man crossing the street, with his Mercedes.  He stops, but after some hesitation, drives away.  From the window of her apartment, Juliette Seznick (Clotilde Hesme) observes the accident, and also sees Al's face.  She runs out into the street to try and help the victim, who is taken to the hospital in critical condition.

A concerned Juliette learns that the injured man named Adrian Drodsta, is an illegal immigrant from Moldavia.  She manages to contact his wife Vera (Arta Dobroshi), and informs her what has happened.  Juliette and meets Vera at the hospital, and becomes close to her, and her family.  Sheffer is about to marry Marion Testard (Adele Haenel), the daughter of the owner of the car dealership, that he has just become a partner in.  Although Al and his friends refuse to go to the police, guilt compels him to visit the victim in the hospital, where he is observed by Juliette, who also manages to track him down.  Things become very complicated and more intriguing, when Juliette, who is trusted by both Al and the Drodsta family, is unexpectedly drawn into becoming an intermediary between them.

Three Worlds deals with the subject of hit and run with some sense of realism, as lives are changed in a split second, and panic and the desire to escape become overpowering.  The characters mostly act in credible ways, although Juliette, who is three months pregnant, has a tendency to become too involved.  The acting performances are very solid, capturing the anguish of the various characters, as nearly everyone suffers some pain.

This film is for those who appreciate a mostly realistic tale, tinged with emotion, and a dash of suspense.  Various subjects and themes are touched on, but the film doesn't spend time developing them.  The spoken language is French, with English subtitles.  Like most Film Movement releases, this one includes a short film as a bonus.  ""The Piano Tuner"" (L'accordeur) is provocative story, with a tense cliffhanger ending.

A complimentary DVD was provided for review purposes.",1376870400,,2472,4.997555012224939
1888891,4,B00009RDGY,"Al is a man who has worked his way up from the bottom of a Paris auto garage. The boss likes him so much that he is giving him a 25% stake in the company, making him the manager and all this when he marries the boss's daughter. So everything is coming up roses. Then on a night out with two colleagues and alleged friends, he hits a pedestrian, and fearful of the consequences he drives off.

The accident is observed by a woman Juliette (Clotilde Hesme - `Mysteries of Lisbon') and she goes to help. Being the caring sort she goes to the Hospital and helps trace the victim's wife Vera (Arta Dobroshi - `The Silence of Lorna'). But Al also has a conscience and realises he must find out how the man is doing. At the hospital he runs into Juliette and she recognises him. Meanwhile Vera's husband is deteriorating as his hospital bills mount; as he is an illegal or `clandestine' immigrant from Moldova he is therefore not entitled to free healthcare. But as Juliette gets more involved, things become increasingly complicated and the line between what is right and wrong extremely blurred all leading her and those involved to be forced to make life changing decisions.

This is one of those films that tackles some unpleasant truths especially around economic migration, which happens the World over. Director Catherine Corsini has used an imagined scenario to look at the human psyche in order to unpick legal rights from moral obligations and has done so in an extremely well made film. There are some things that I thought were a bit of a push, like Al having all his eggs in one basket with regards to his job, marriage, home and car all wrapped up in the hands of his boss/Father in law, but that is not unheard of. Al is played by Raphael Personnaz - `The Princess of Montpensier' and `Anna Karenina' , and he makes it completely believable.

All the performances are excellent and the music is spot on but works so well with the plot that it is almost background throughout. The location shots and action are all convincing, but most of all it is extremely compelling and watchable, at 100 minutes it is one of those that flies by. The DVD from Film Movement, whom I received this from for review purposes , also contains a short film called `The Piano Tuner' which is also in French with good sub titles and is also rather good. All in all an excellent film that I find easily able to recommend, especially to fans of independent European cinema.",1376524800,5,2456,4.552036199095022
1888892,4,B00009RDGY,"Three guys, out for the night, momentarily distracted and lives can change in an instant. Al is racked with guilt after fleeing the accident scene and is oblivious that the accident was witnessed by a woman from an upstairs window.

Eventually, many lives are affected and the moral dilemma of what to do, when to go along with things, when to take a stand, all collide and escalate. Relationships are formed because of this horrible occurrence, merging lives that would otherwise have never converged.

This was a good movie to watch but did seem to drag a bit. It was hard to watch at times since the whole scenario made me squirm with discomfort at the immorality of it all.

The acting was good, the storyline was good with lots of emotional drama.

The movie is in French with English subtitles.

I was provided a copy of the film for evaluation and an honest review.",1376179200,,872,4.6
1888893,5,B00009RDGY,"Director Catherine Corsini has crafted a poignant, deliberate and angst ridden film openly displaying the wide range of human emotions between three people. Each one different, with their worlds intertwined in guilt, remorse, empathy and possible resolution. A middle-class man (Al) is out with his long time buddies drinking one night when they accidentally strike a pedestrian. Fleeing, they are witnessed from the balcony of a pregnant woman (Juliette), who calls the police. Al is only a few days from marriage and a new life at a high-class car dealership. He has everything to lose.

Juliette is having her own emotional upheavals and feels compelled to become part of the discovery of the driver. Adding to her dilemma, Juliette contacts and befriends the distraught victim's wife, Vera. Both Vera and her husband are illegal immigrants from Moldavia, adding to their problems of exposure and lack of finances for health care. Juliette also recognizes the guilt ridden driver when he secretly visits the stricken immigrant who is in severe intensive care.

The well-paced plot continues with Juliette and Al slowly getting to know each other, discussing the incident, the future and the intense guilt and secrecy that they both feel. Juliette also rides a fine line when she finds herself in the middle between Al and Vera, acting as a mediator. The emotions run raw between all characters. The dialogue is sparse and succinct, sometimes edging to a point where it is impossible to predict how each character will react.

Director Corsini and co writer Benot Graffin allow honest and complicated emotions and circumstances to unfold in a sometimes surprising way. Nothing is predictable. All three characters lives are at stake and the end result might not be exactly what you expect. It's a conundrum of simple decisions made and complicated conflicts that may never be resolved. Well worth a second or third watch, the cinematography and musical score are mesmerizing.

Added to this DVD is a unique and Hitchcockian short called, ""The Piano Tuner"". Olivier Treiner's ingenious short thriller tells the story of a young man who is a disgraced musical prodigy. He settles into becoming a piano tuner-- who also pretends to be blind. Fascinated by a blind piano tuner, people are very eager to hire the young man, making him in high demand. This places him in various awkward and funny circumstances when people go about their personal business while he tunes and plays their piano in their presence. The final scene finds the tuner entering a senior woman's apartment where she reluctantly allows him in. He sees something that shocks him, but he cannot let on. The final moments are spine chilling and makes for an ending that would make Hitchcock proud. It's that good. DVD supplied for review.",1375660800,,2804,5.062770562770563
1888894,5,B00009RDGY,"This French film with English subtitles is aptly named, because a moment of inattention brought three worlds crashing together.  Al is an up and coming young man from a poor family who has not only achieved professional success at the car dealership where he works, he has also had the good fortune to fall in love with and get engaged to his employer's daughter.  Life is going very well indeed for him until one evening, while out celebrating with a couple of friends and fellow employees, he runs down and badly injures a pedestrian.  His friends yell at him to drive on, that no one has seen what happened and that all will be well.  But someone has seen.  Juliette, a young medical student, has witnessed the accident though she is unable to identify the car or the driver.  She summons help and later visits the badly injured man in the hospital, where she meets his wife Vera, an illegal immigrant from Moldova.  Al, Juliette, and Vera become entangled in a complicated relationship dance where each has some power or hold over the others.

Although this movie is about a man who committed a serious crime, it is not a simple morality piece.  The three main characters are all complex individuals, with no one being clearly ""the good guy"" or ""the heavy."" In the end a resolution is reached, though it is not satisfactory to any of the three, and we recognize that the accident and what came after it have created after effects that will reverberate through all three worlds for the rest of the characters' lives.

The film is beautifully shot, with many dark brooding city scapes of Paris which fit the overall mood.  Three Worlds is not a film with easy answers. Some will find the ending disquieting, but it will not be an easy film for any of its viewers to forget.",1375401600,,1775,4.5854430379746836
