3842073,5,B0023T9ZR0,"One of the most interesting and striking aspects about these excellent productions by the Mariinsky Theatre of two of Stravinsky's most famous ballets is the elegance of the dancing.  Just compare the Russian company's performance of LE SACRE with that of the Joffrey Ballet (available on YOUTUBE in a watchable transcription of the original NPR broadcast, part of its ""Dance in America"" series), and you'll be immediately struck by the more secure technique of the Mariinsky dancers as opposed to that of the somewhat faster, more percussive and angular(emphasizing sharp angles) performance by the Joffrey. I found the Joffrey somewhat detached and slightly mechanical in their rendering of Part 1, and not as effective as the newer Russian version reviewed here. However, it's definetly worth comparing these two versions in Part 2, since the Joffrey's Young Girls are very effective in their parts, and Beatriz Rodriguez as The Chosen One is really outstanding in the Sacraficial Dance, showing palpable fear as well as generating real excitement. In contrast, Alexandra Iosifidi, the Mariinsky's Chosen One, is perhaps a bit less convincing, not showing as much emotion, but still very, very good. But overall, this new Mariinsky production is far superior in all the important areas, including their greater fluidity and elegance of performance, undoubtedly because this reproduction of Nijinsky's original choreography has been available for about twenty years by now, and because Valery Giergiev is a great conductor who generates more excitement in this live performance. (The Joffrey seems to be in a studio).

  The FIREBIRD is given an equally splendid performance, with interesting differences in contrast to the studio performance seen on Decca's wonderful ""Return of the Firebird,"" which includes equally fine productions of ""Petrushka"" and Diagelev's ballet based on ""Scheherazade.""  If you have a copy of that DVD and this new Mariinsky DVD, you'll be able to treat yourself to a profound experience of the evolution of some of the greatest ballets ever created because you'll realize that Stravinsky wrote the music of his first three ballets to be danced to, and that specific parts of the music correspond to specific parts of a story.  You'll never listen to the music in the same way after you see what it was created for.",1277337600,13,2344,5.254010695187166
3842074,5,B0023T9ZR0,"I bought this video to use as part of a curriculum unit on 20th century music for my fifth grade music classes. They learned about the famous riot that the Rite of Spring caused. I love how this video has the original choreography, costumes, and scenery that were featured in the original production of 1913. It's understandable to see why the polite Parisian audience was so shocked.
How fantastic, also that the first ballet on this disc is The Firebird, which made Stravinsky an overnight success. Putting these two on the same disc is a perfect idea.",1273622400,6,554,4.721649484536083
3842075,5,B0023T9ZR0,"This is the production we have hoped for.  This is the Millicent Hodson/Kenneth Archer reconstruction that was originally staged by the Robert Joffrey Ballet.  And it is all that we have waited for.  The production values of the DVD are top quality. (I have watched the Blu-Ray version and the DVD version and found both to be excellent.)  The bonus material on the reconstruction of the ballet is almost as moving and powerful as the performance, and was perfectly complemented by Hodson's book, ""Nijinsky's Crime Against Grace"".  This dance, 'Le Sacre du Printemps', changed all dance that came after it, and changed all cultural thought about dance.  If you have ever moved to a tune on an ipod, 'The Rite of Spring' is the reason why.  This performance, on this DVD, says it all.  This is it.",1272412800,7,796,4.759124087591241
3842076,5,B0023T9ZR0,"To start off, two great things in this DVD's favor:  It's in HD and Valery Gergiev is conducting.

Firebird:  I believe I own a copy of every DVD of this ballet:  This one goes right to the top for some important reasons.  Gergiev:  I've always liked his cd of this music, and if anything his interpretation here is even more musical, more luminous, more coloristic here than on the cd. (!)  Worth buying for the audio portion alone.  Ekaterina Kondaurova as The Firebird:  Absolutely spell-binding.  You can see her dance some Forsythe on YouTube and she is a WOW as a Forsythe dancer, even better, I would say, than Sylvie Guillem (and that is saying something).  She's 5'8"", over 6' en pointe, and that alone gives her a great stage presence--a commanding presence in this ballet especially where that commanding presence is almost a requirement.  And talk about expressive!: every part of her body, including the most mesmerizing arms and hands.  Leeann Benjamin--my now-second-favorite Firebird--says that this is the most difficult ballet to dance because there are so many jumps and you have to do them all while giving the impression somehow of a bird.  Kondaurova does just that.  (A special personal delight:  In the pas de deux between the Firebird and Ivan, at one point he carries her on his shoulder, during which, in all the other recordings, she does something which resembles the breast stroke and which looks silly to me.  Kondaurova manages to look fetchingly bird-like and not do this swim stroke at all.)  She dances with great amplitude, suppleness and clarity and makes great use of her arched Russian back. I could watch this DVD forever, I think, and never tire in the least of her dancing--it's that wonderful. Ilya Kuznetsov as Ivan:  Wow!  All other Ivans look rather pale beside his, including Liepa's.  Here's a role with no actual dancing in it (unless you consider partnering dancing)--I would think, a rather thankless role--but he gives to it unstintingly.  You can easily read all kinds of emotions appropriate to, and enhancing of, the drama in his face, his manner.  Bravo!  ""There are no small parts,...""  I could go on, but you get the picture I am sure.

Le Sacre du Printemps:  This is a reproduction--as best as can be in this time--of the original that caused such a sensation.  Very much an ensemble ballet, much like Les Noces.  Everything that is/was classical ballet was thrown out the window:  no pointe shoes, no figure-revealing costumes, no classical ballet vocabulary, and not even any turn-out (it's in fact all turn-IN instead)!  By-and-large the dancers do a good job of creating an atmosphere of a pagan rite, but for me, at least, it could still look MORE pagan, more primitive.  And The Chosen One, Alexandra Iosifidi, is tall (also) and is gorgeous, but to me never looks, while she is standing dead still or while she is dancing, that she is AFRAID.  (I would love to see the Joffrey make a DVD of their ""Rite"" (even without Gergiev) to see how it stacks up, as I have read great things about it.)  Of course, she is gorgeous and you can't get a more beautiful name than ""Iosifidi"".  Gergiev is once again magnificent.

All-in-all, very highly recommended.",1263859200,75,3216,4.815356489945155
3842077,5,B0023T9ZR0,"Young Russian composer Igor Stravinsky's first ballet The Firebird created a sensation in Paris when it was first presented in 1910 by Les Ballets Russes. The second of the trio, Petroushka, appeared the following year. The third,Le Sacre du Printemps, the most revolutionary ballet ever performed and almost impossible to dance because of its irregular rhythms, caused a riot at its premiere in 1913.
Now it is possible to see what caused the uproar with the  recreation of the original performances of Firebird and Rite of Spring by the Mariinsky Orchestra and Ballet. Both outstanding performances are conducted by Valery Gergiev and are based on the original choreography by Michel Fokine for Firebird and Vaslav Nijinsky for Rite of Spring.
There are several excellent performances on DVD of The Firebird and a few of The Rite of Spring, but this one is unique. It allows you to see  what the Paris audiences saw at the beginning of the last century. Both performances still look revolutionary today. Ballet has never been the same since.",1261699200,38,1043,5.023121387283237
3842078,5,B0023T9ZR0,"Finding a decent production of Stravinsky's first ballet, The Firebird, on DVD is fairly easy.  Finding one of his most popular (and notorious) ballet, Le Sacre du Printemps (The Rite of Spring), is not so easy.  Thankfully, this DVD contains both of these great 20th century works, performed energetically by the Mariinsky Orchestra and Ballet, under the baton of the great Russian conductor Valery Gergiev.
CD recordings of both of these works, conducted by Gergiev, have received positive reviews.  For this DVD, great care went into researching and trying to reconstruct the original choreography.  The faithful reproduction of these works are primarily the responsibility of dance historian Kenneth Archer and choreographer Millicent Hodson.  Both took great care in presenting these ballets as they might have been seen in 1910 and, scandalously, in 1913, when the debut of Le Sacre du Printemps caused a riot when it appeared at the Theatre des Champs-Elysees.
Fans of ballet and contemporary dance should not hesitate in picking up this DVD.  Both performances were filmed in HD, and many camera angles (including aerial) are used to show the work that went into staging these great ballets.  Extras include an interview with Archer and Hodson, rehearsal sequences, and historical information about Stravinsky, the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, and the impresario Serge Diaghilev.  This DVD is released in time to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Ballet Russes.

As one authority stated, ""This music in no longer on trial.  You are.""  I doubt anyone exactly loves this work, but it is a landmark of the 20th Century.  Being able to see the ballet that goes along with the familiar music is wonderful treat.  Now, could we get videos of this quality of other landmark 20th Century ballets?  I will nominate Debussy's Afternoon of a Faune, Ravel's Daphnis & Chloe, Ravel's Bolero, Bartok's Miraculous Mandarin, Copland's Appalachian Spring just to start.",1407715200,,647,4.672566371681416
3842084,5,B0023T9ZR0,Known the music for fifty years (first record heard was the Mercury stereo  with Antal Dorati - fabulous) but had never once seen it in performance till now.  The documentary in the extras explains how the choreographers reconstituted the movements from photographs of the original performance as the choreography had not been recorded originally: please goodness it may now enter the repertoire: imagine an evening of Les Sylphides in the first half and Le Sacre in the second,1404345600,,477,5.102564102564102
3842085,2,B0023T9ZR0,"Firebird fantastic and great photography. Rites was very poor photography, useless in fact. The DVD was either faulty or meant for the American zone, so kept stopping and starting.

3842086,5,B0023T9ZR0,"Musically, this production was phenomenal. THE best musical interpretation of either of these ballets I've ever heard.

As far as 'Firebird' goes, Ekaterina Kondaurova's interpretation of the role was technically perfect. There is no question that she did all of the choreography flawlessly, it was just missing  SOUL. Especially in that entrancing pas de deux where the prince catches the firebird, she had NO emotion on her face whatsoever. Where's the desperation and anguish at suddenly having your freedom ripped from you? Nowhere to be seen, which was disappointing as that pas de deux is my favorite part. Margot Fonteyn nailed it, and I'm fond of Diana Vishneva's Firebird, if you're looking for other good interpretations of the role.

The Rite of Spring is a revival of the original choreography, and retained all of the creepy drone-like qualities of the 1980's production. I'm glad I own this now, as the video quality of that older production is not very good. But I've always loved this ballet.",1395360000,,1008,5.0602409638554215
3842087,5,B0023T9ZR0,It is nteresting to see the ballet company for which Stravinsky was composing.  The productions are traditional in scope and costume.,1390262400,,133,5.333333333333333
3842088,4,B0023T9ZR0,"Not only do I own a copy of this performance on laserdisc, I was actually present for Igor Stravinsky's infamous debut of The Rite of Spring at Theatre Champs-Elysees in Paris, 1913. Yes, I was there. Paris was abuzz about the ballet prior to its first appearance, it was said to be a pivotal work of modern art, and was highly anticipated. Although, the last time Parisians had heard such claims, an enormous hunk of metal was erected right in the center of the city, and of course not everyone appreciated its presence (Toor). In 1913 the masses were either embracing change or rejecting it, which would explain the impending riot on May 29th inside the theater (Toor).
 The venue for this performance couldn not have been any more fitting. The brand-new Theatre Champs-Elysees was as unconventional as the performance inside was to be (Sullivan). The a-symmetrical and comparably plain, modern facade lent to its avant-guard nature (Sullivan). The more lavish interior was relatively more expected of French spirit, albeit the pre-art deco characteristics (Elliot G.).
 Without much adjustment period to our unusual environment, the ballet itself proved to be mayhem of the senses. Dancers in fantastical costumes jigged and jumped around simultaneously in a primitive display. There were some other unusual movements, such as bowing up and down, altogether very strange. Prior to the end of the production the audience began to participate violently (Toor). Unsure of the message in the choreography, they seemed to insinuate it as a personal depreciation of their intelligence, as shown by the produce later cast onto the stage by the assemblage. En fin, it was revealed that part of the message in the interpretive dance was a Pagan ritual sacrificing a virgin to the coming spring (""Joffrey Ballet Resurrects the Rite of Spring""). As one can imagine, this also was not met with the utmost approval from the petulant audience. Personally, I felt as though Hieronymus Bosch's interpretation of hell was animated and presented to dance before us on stage. Perhaps I was not the only one present who felt that way.
 The orchestra was admirable in their ability to comprehend and play forth the peculiar ostinati (Strauss, et al 43). These repeating collections of notes evoked ideas such as a ticking clock, a nasal-sounding bird wailing in pain, and drumming that did not quite sound like a drum; all of which seemed to take us nowhere in particular. At some points, multiple motifs happening simultaneously aroused a playful attitude, teasing the audience with alternating high and low pitches, begging the question of where the story, if any was going.
  Stravinsky utilized diatonic harmonies, or major and minor keys (Holton), which in my opinion gave it an eerie coldness. The form that does exist for this piece is at best repetitive and sectioned into tiny movements, other than that to me it sounded like a wave of sounds rambling on to no end. The irregular division of time and the patterns of beats rise and fall in loudness and pitch, and stop and start erratically. For example, when the beating drums and the bashing of the aerophones are playing at once but in different rhythms and beats, polyrhythm and polymeter are being utilized at this point in the piece. This beating and bashing is not quite literal, it is almost as if the orchestra had been assimilated to the culture of percussion. The up-sweeping and down-swooping melody further accented the irregularity of the work, like a seasickness. The low and high notes within the chords relatively clashing in contrast to one another created dissonance to the ear, contributing to the tension of the listener. In fact, all of these dual themes and polar characteristics could accord for an anxious listener.
  Betwixt the visually bizarre dance and the near-frightening aural experience, in conjunction with the violent audience; the original performance was an altogether jarring experience. The dancers exhibited only a trace amount of talent compared to a typical ballet, it felt overly synchronized in relation to the percussion's movements (Toor). I felt that though the musical work lent value to the entirety and though Nijinksy's choreography was a contemporary type of brilliant, it had skewed the music into a bizarre place.
All of that being said, I do intend to upgrade my laserdisc version to Blu-ray after Christmas. This is a pretty solid recreation. Of course, nothing compares to actually witnessing the prolific opening night, but not everyone is a pretentious wizard and can live for over one hundred years to write an amazon review about it.",1386633600,,4635,5.066841415465269

3842091,2,B0023T9ZR0,"Very disappointing.  It's not easy to find a DVD of a production of Le Sacre du Printemps so I seized on this one.  Costumes are good and a nice try at authenticity.  However the dancers are often out of time with the music.  Admittedly it's difficult but I can't help wishing more work went in to teaching dancers - and resourcing them to practice - rhythmically challenging pieces with the precision of a percussionist.

Cinematography is appalling - they missed the fundamental importance of Fred Astaire's innovation that the camera should show the whole body.  This is *dance*, we want to see their feet and the impact of the whole stage, not close ups of their faces.",1365724800,6,673,4.7094017094017095

3842093,5,B0023T9ZR0,"I found this DVD while searching for a possible copy of the Joffrey version.  I have not yet watched ""Firebird"", but I did watch ""Le Sacre du Printemps.""  WOW!  Alexandra Iosifidi gives an unbelievable, perfect performance as the Chosen One.  She deserved to be chosen.  Her stamina, her technique, her artistry, all combine to create a magnificent solo.  The entire company is dazzling, with the usual Maryinsky detail and beauty.  The costumes, set , and superb reconstruction of the ballet are a special treat and a must see for balletomanes everywhere.  I saw Kenneth Archer and Millicent Hodson at a symposium held years ago for the Joffrey production of this ballet,and it clarified and taught a lot about this ballet and the time of the ""Ballets Russes.""  I remember what a thrill it was for me to see the premier at the Joffrey.  Thank you, Joffrey and Maryinsky for reviving and keeping such an important piece of ballet history.  If you are a lover of ballet, and dance, you must have this DVD.  If you are also a Russophile, like me, you will be thrilled at the preservation of folklore, dance, and music.  I must not forget the intriguing music of the great Igor Stravinsky.  The greatest reason of all to see this DVD is because it brings to life the thrilling French era of the arts from the early twentieth century.

3842095,5,B0023T9ZR0,"I initially bought this video because my daughter loves watching the Firebird with all the glitzy costumes and classical dance movements, but I also secretly bought it because I love The Rite of Spring. I've never been a fan of ballet, and I've listened to this piece of music many times as a concert piece, but after watching this ballet I don't think I will ever be able to listen to ballet music without the visual dance movements again. I know Nijinsky has been criticized as a choreographer, but for me a non-lover of classical ballet, his movements were powerful and showed a deep connection to the relationship tribal people have with the earth. As a society I feel like we have become detached from our basic primal relationship we have with nature and will probably pay a large price for that, and for me the score and choreography of this piece was very moving and touched upon some very powerful emotions and issues.",1357084800,2,927,4.658536585365853
3842096,5,B0023T9ZR0,I was astounded by the musicianship and ballet artistry. You get to really see and hear the orchestra during all the preludes and overtures.

3842097,3,B0023T9ZR0,"I had not been much of a ballet fan, but had the good luck to see, on YouTube, the 1987 Joffrey reconstruction of the 1913 Stravinsky/Diaghelev Paris ""Riot"" production of Le Sacre Du Printemps (original sets, costumes, choreography; shown back then on PBS's ""Dance in America"".) (On YouTube, search: ( stravinsky rite fatovamingus ); in 3 ten-minute parts.) I've since watched it many times, and continue to be overwhelmed by it. I always loved the music, but seeing it danced this way makes it an order of magnitude more powerful. It's not classical ballet -- on purpose. It makes one feel a part of tribal rituals of eons ago. The chasteness of the costumes, the simplicity and crudeness of most of the movements (toes pointed in; pawing ground like an animal; stamping), the human imperfections of the performance; all add to the feeling of ""You Are There"".

(I cannot believe that PBS has not made this available on DVD! That they haven't is a disgrace, and shows the ""ever-more-mid-bell-curve-programming-to-please-the-masses-at-the-cost-of-passing-over-the-greatest-art"" mentality of PBS management. (According to PBS, ""It's a union/contract thing.""))

I did subsequently view two other Rite videos, to compare: Pina Bausch (who makes a sexual exercise out of it, which it was not meant to be) and this Mariinsky (lacks sinister, primitive feel) but IMO they really don't compete. I do know that when I am as deeply pierced by a work as this Joffrey Rite, it is hard for me to be open-minded thereafter...:)",1341446400,6,1513,5.146341463414634

Photography was just short of excellent. 4. Color saturation was perfect, I did not have to adjust the color or tint at all. Perhaps the red that represented the Firebird could have been a little less intense.(This is just my preference). 5. The Prancipals were actually young and Hindsome.(LOL) 6. The Ballerinas uniformly young and pretty. (I have another version where the principals need plastic surgery). 7. I know nothing of dance but it all seemed very fluid and graceful in movement. Even the frenetic demonium dance was very well done.  8. Kondaurova was surprising in her long leaps. Ananiashvili performs long leaps also in her version of the Firebird. Amazing. Perhaps the Firebird could have been a little more desperate to escape.(again, just my preference). 9. Gergiev conducted and elicited an exciting score. I don't actually know his work (or anything about music for that matter) but I liked this. 10. This ballet is based on an old Russian folk tale they say. I saw it as an allegory for the Adam and Eve story. The Firebird could be seen as Archangel Michael. When you steal ""Apples"" from the ""Tree"" in the ""Garden"" demons will come after you. Two audio tracks, Stereo and 3/2.1. Includes pracitice sessions as extras. This is well worth owning and is now my favorite of the three versions I own. I won't comment on Le Sacre du Printemps.

3842099,1,B0023T9ZR0,"I am a music professor, and for almost 25 years, I have relied on bootleg reproductions of PBS's Great Performances' airing of the Joffrey Ballet's reconstruction of the Rite (now available on UTube) for my classes.  Naturally, I leapt at the opportunity to obtain a commercially released (LEGAL!) video.  I tried to remain open minded, but from the first trembling strokes of the conductor's baton this DVD disappointed.  The tempos in the music were disjointed (listen to the ostinato which radically changes tempos when the curtain opens), the dancers were imprecise and lethargic, the fist pumps at the end of the first section looked like half-hearted black power gestures at the 1968 Olympics, and the sacrificial virgin's final death actually made me laugh/cry with frustration.",1302652800,20,785,5.264
3842100,5,B0023T9ZR0,"Perhaps the best aspect of this high quality and historically accurate production of The Rites of Spring is that it enables you both to understand the anger of the audience and the genius of Stravinsky. The art lovers who came to the theater and were greeted by totally unrecognizable cultural vocabulary were understandably shocked.

In fact such an audience is far superior to the ones the art world gets today who are so unschooled that it is politically correct (and demanded) to approve of anything sent their way. So you have, for instance, museum goers oohing and ahhing over a dead shark in a tank of formaldehyde. The turn of the century art lovers might have had too little imagination to appreciate what they watched, but they had the neccessary education and taste to appreciate most of what they saw.

At the same time, to watch the Rites as presented here is to see Stravinsky's genius and originality. For The Rites is beautiful, and while it requires a fresh look at the vocabulary of dance different from what was the standard of 1912, it is rewarding.

It would be useful to read one of the numerous books on The Rites of Spring in order to enjoy the performance. I recommend Modris Ekstein's The Rites of Spring which covers the rise of modernism from The Rites of Spring through the end of World War I. Although the book does not spend a lot of time on the performance itself, it fits The Rites firmly into its time and place and shows just how revolutionary it was.

I'm encouraged by some of the less flattering reviews here from people who have a more refined knowledge of dance than I do. It shows that there is still a cadre of art lovers who have taste and standards. However, for someone like me, who loves dance in all its forms but lacks the background to be truly discriminating, I can assure you that whatever the flaws in the performance here, they are invisible to most people.

Since this is likely the only quality performance of The Rites of Spring we'll get for a long time, and the only historically accurate version we'll get for an even longer time, this is the one to see",1302480000,12,2112,4.5473684210526315

When I saw the restoration of ""The Rite of Spring"" in the 80s at the Joffrey Ballet in New York, I was astonished at how ""right"" it seemed.  For a ballet considered ""lost"" for many years, this effort seemed to bring history alive.  I had read about the riots on opening night.  I could understand the assault of the orchestral dissonance to an audience which apparently had advance knowledge of what they were about to hear: that the music would be daunting to them.  Then to be confronted by knock-kneed, expressionless, flat-footed rhythmic dancing was the final insult.

In this DVD, much of the impact is unfortunately mitigated by poor editing, close-ups, and showy Berkeley-esque camera angles (from the ceiling, no less).  The dancers seem much more disorganized in their groups because of these issues, although the rehearsal footage doesn't exactly convince me that the ballet masters enforced the rhythmic fidelity upon which Nijinsky would have insisted.  There is a lack of tautness that results in a lack of conviction.  It is not the indifferent faces of the dances, especially the sacrificial virgin; Nijinsky surely hoped the music would convey the primal emotions of his dancers.  Although Gergiev brings some insight to the conducting, he is often self-indulgent.  It is also clear that the scenery and costumes are glitzy adaptations of the Roerich originals.

The Joffrey performance, which was filmed for PBS, exists on a (possibly bootlegged) DVD, available on the Net.  I don't know whether the DVD is licensed, but I assume not.  That performance should be reissued on disc.  It does the ballet justice.

We also are subjected to pretentious prattle of Millicent Hodson, the restorer of this ballet.  She attributes a kind of metaphysical aspect to Nijinsky's creativity, forgetting completely that the idea for the ballet came to Stravinsky in a dream.  Nijinsky was a more simple, emotional creator than an intellectual.  He did research, which she totally ignores.

The performance of ""The Firebird"" is not as accomplished as the Royal Ballet DVD.  Leanne Benjamin gets all the humor that Karsavina would have brought to the role.  But Ekaterina Kandaurova is astonishing; not just visually stunning, but also full of humor.  She has the most beautiful hands I have ever seen on any dancer, including Maya and Margot.  The princess, in contrast, played by Marianna Pavlova (hmm...), is as graceful as Jane Krakowski.  There is no love in her eyes for the prince.  No enchantment.  Don't be tempted to purchase the DVD entitled ""Return of the Firebird;""  the makeup is so heavy, the characters look like hookers.  That disc is spoiled by numerous, idiotic close-ups as well.",1300492800,24,3141,5.767391304347826
3842102,5,B0023T9ZR0,"It seems to me these choreographic re-creations of the original Stravinsky ballets are about as close as we're going to get to what the Parisian audiences saw at their premieres.  ""Firebird"" here clears up for me what a lot of the music (especially in the Kashchei scenes) was designed to fit to the pantomime.  Fokine's choreography all seems a bit tame now, certainly when compared to some contemporary productions; the final scene strikes me as almost ludicrously sedate.  Most interesting to me is the attempt at reproducing Nijinsky's ""Rite of Spring""; I can see why the audience rebelled: not at the music (a huge success a few weeks later when performed as a purely musical item at a symphony concert), but at the dance elements.  After Nijinsky's scandalous success in ""Afternoon of a Faun,"" Diaghilev gave Nijinsky free-rein to choreograph ""Rite"" and what a shock for the audience (looking for athletic young bodies in form-fitting costumes performing leaps and lifts and exuberant acrobatics) to see the dancers clothed in formless ""Indian-squaw"" outfits, heads down, pounding out rhythms on the floor.  That might be anthropologically interesting to a scholarly audience today, but the Parisian audience was outraged.  My reaction, if this reproduction is in any way authentic, makes me feel that Nijinsky was not a talented choreographer; the ballet here seems quite a muddle.  But what a lovely scandal!  Thanks to Valery Gergiev and his team for the research and skill, along with the time and effort, to give us a chance to see what these famous ballets probably looked like in their original form.",1298160000,5,1613,5.083333333333333
3842103,3,B0023T9ZR0,"Prepare yourself for the most frustrating viewing experience!  Right from the start the camera seemingly deliberately cuts the feet of dancers;  then it pans in and out, moves as a drunkard, and finally, as not being able to entertain itself with the performance, it starts filming it from the top!

WHO was behind the camera?  It feels as ""they"" had absolutely no appreciation of what they are filming;  no understanding of ballet as an art form; no conception of the fact that it speaks with a body, not a face and not with one body part shot close-up style.  What makes it especially ruinous here, in ""Le Sacre du printemps"", that as the choreographer herself speaks in Bonus section, there are NO prima ballerina or center characters; EACH dancer dances his own part and each person on stage is equally important.  Well, was that known to the cameraman?  Why was a decent performance allowed to be so crudely decimated by the ignorant and careless?

Apart from the hideous camera work, there are other things that are not perfect.  Although the dancers in this ""Firebird"" are beautiful, their dancing is average; again, the atrocious close-ups of the camera do not help appreciating their skill and choreography.  The orchestra sounds somewhat dull; Georgiev looks unkempt and unclean.  Watching and listening to this, I suddenly asked myself - how is it that we see only Georgiev from Kirov? Don't they have other conductors, young talents, etc.?  Maybe it is time for some shake-up there, so poorly was the whole Firebird done.  There are a few other Firebirds on DVD, done with exactly the same mis-en-scene and designs by Goncharova which could be much highly recommended - I personally like very much the one done by The Royal Ballet of Covent Garden with Leanne Benjamin in the title role; there you can truly see and hear The Firebird  instead of this tepid Swamp Lake.

Next on this DVD is ""Le Sacre du Printemps"" ballet which is not as readily available as a ballet, although there are plenty of recordings.  It is exactly due to the rarity of Le Sacre on DVD that this camera work comes across as criminal, because in this ballet the DVD producers really ruined the show which otherwise seems to be pretty good, or at least valuable from the historic standpoint.

I would truly love to see better Nicolai Rerikh (Nicolas Roerich) decorations;  it is so precious to see as it was seen by Parisian audience roughly 100 years ago.  And although you get a glimpse of it in this film,  the camera moves again in a totally chaotic, insane fashion, depriving the viewer from enjoying the so very well-thought inventive choreography of Vaslav Nijinsky.  Yet even with this atrocious camera work, one could still grasp an idea of what a great innovation this whole opus was; the music and choreograhy are so avant-garde, and remain so today!  It was also amusing to hear an ovation at the end of Le Sacre - I doubt very much that the contemporary Russian public truly love this music - it is so far from the tradition of Social Realism and all on what Soviet people raised... Also, one feels once more that this Stravinsky's music is really not suited well to being performed as an orchestral piece, as it is most often heard - Le Sacre music  was really written for the ballet, and without the visual it is impossible to understand it fully.

Overall, the impression of this DVD is that it was done by some amateur filmmaker who had no understanding or appreciation for what he was filming; it is therefore very frustrating to watch, especially imagining how you could see it with your own eyes there, in the actual theater.  Unfortunately, this is another sad example of ignorant making of the ballet film; it shows that opera obviously suffers less from poor filmmaking since it's much less visual, while in ballet it is really the core and the essence - the show.  It is irredeemable if it's ruined as in this film.

Yet for Le Sacre I still give it four stars, so my overall rating of this film is 3 stars, simply for the historical and educational significance of ""Le Sacre du printemps"" part on it.",1297382400,23,4110,4.686629526462395
3842104,4,B0023T9ZR0,"About Stravinsky's music--what is there to say? This is a good orchestra with good sound in St. Petersburg's magnificent Mariinsky Theatre. The dancing is great and it's fascinating to see a recreation of Nijinsky's original choreography of Sacre du Printemps from 1913, with Roerich's backdrops. My only complaint is the cinematography. During the orchestral sections, too many shots of the conductor and too few of the musicians. In the ballets, too many close-ups of the dancers and too few of the whole stage--as if you were watching most of the performance through binoculars. Then there are overhead shots of the dancers that make little sense. That said, this is a wonderful performance, and if you aren't lucky enough to see it live, I highly recommend the DVD.",1297382400,2,769,5.062992125984252
3842105,4,B0023T9ZR0,I really enjoyed this DVD.  I have enjoyed the music since my teens but had never seen the ballets performed.  I was not disappointed. An excellent production along:  Very colourful costumes and scenery and excellent audio.,1293580800,,223,5.138888888888889
3842106,5,B0023T9ZR0,"I do not think that there will ever be a piece of music as perpetually hip as the Rite of Spring. I have loved this music for decades and always felt a tinge of sadness that I had never seen it choreographed; and, the delightful thing about this DVD is that the dancing enhances my long held love and appreciation of the music. Nijinsky clearly got the music - his efforts appear to my admittedly dance-naive eye to be every bit as revolutionary as Stravinsky's. Based on the fine orchestral performance presented here and the obvious struggles with timing of many of the supporting dancers I would say that the musicians have won out so far; but, the prima ballerina who is 'sacrificed', at the ballet's conclusion, dances with crisp precision - she and her choreography are astounding. This is a wonderful presentation all around!",1289174400,4,832,4.744827586206896

When the chosen one fell to the floor I wondered what she was doing as she was so lacking in drama yet know and love the ballet.  Please Paris, Kirov or Bolshoi make a DVD of the Right of Spring. Many years ago I saw a  performance on television from Paris that I recorded and recently lost. If only that could be found and reproduced on DVD.

3842108,5,B0023T9ZR0,"This is a most enjoyable DVD. I am a musician, not a dance connoisseur, and my enjoyment of ballet reflects primarily how the dance interacts with a great musical score. Here we have two of Stravinsky's great early ballets, with restored choreography from the epochal original productions by Dyagilev's Ballets Russes, produced by one of Russia's great dance companies, and led by a great Russian conductor. How could one miss? ""The Firebird"" is beautiful classical dance, with a fanciful scenario and brilliant stage effects to match the inimitably colorful music. I have a copy of the PBS program about the restoration of the ""Rite of Spring"" choreography. The performance there by the Joffrey Ballet is very good, but this one is better; the dancing is more polished, the costumes more vibrant, and Gergiev's conducting more dynamic. We all know about the riot the original production produced; it's less known that when ""The Rite of Spring"" was played in concert in 1915 the audience loved it. Seeing this staging, I wonder if the first audience was offended by the choreography as much as the music ... Wouldn't it be nice if Gergiev and company would follow up with ""Petrushka"" and ""Les Noces""? And wouldn't it be great to have well-filmed productions of the two great French ballets Dyagilev commissioned: Ravel's ""Daphnis et Chlo"" and Debussy's ""Jeux""?",1278201600,7,1360,5.0488888888888885

8350027,4,B0023T9ZR0,"I think this is an enjoyable ballet video, even though it is a bit ironic for the Mariinsky to be dancing works that were made in reaction against Imperial Russian ballet.

There is fine, expressive dancing throughout, high production values in both ballets, and, most importantly, good sound and picture quality. Of course, its always easy to criticize the shot selection and editing of dance filmsnothing can live up to seeing and hearing performances in person obviouslybut I feel this release does a respectable job of balancing static, audiences-view shots with close-ups and inserts from different angles.

Viewing a close recreation of the original Sacre/Rite was a highlight for me. If youve seen any of the more recent versions, such as by Pina Bausch, Sasha Waltz, or Yuri Possokhov, its very interesting and thought provoking to get a sense of what Diaghilev, Stravinsky, Nijinsky, and Roerich intended back in 1913.

The original production in all its details is reproduced and it is possible to see why it provoked such a reaction in its audience - albeit negative.

8350035,1,B0023T9ZR0,"Nijinsky was NOT Busby Berkeley.  If I am choreographing a ballet - particularly a reconstruction of an early twentieth century one - I am NOT interested in seeing what the audience might see if looking down on the dancers from above the stage.  I am NOT interested in an extreme close-up of the conductor's face.  I am NOT interested in the faces of individual dancers.  In this recording the cameraman runs the show and in an effort to show HIS creativity, the fine work of everyone else involved is ruined.  It breaks my heart to see such an otherwise excellent production so destroyed.
If I were photographing a ballet and a section/group of the dancers had each dancer doing the same movements, I MIGHT be tempted to zoom-in to see that section.  But, in a ballet like ""Sac,"" where the choreography for each dancer is often different from everybody else, the constant camera movement destroys the effect.
Moreover, I don't need to see how much each dancer is sweating or heavily he/she is breathing.
How sad.",1423008000,6,1013,4.7272727272727275
