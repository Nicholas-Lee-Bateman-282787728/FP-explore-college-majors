193564,1,1573627089,"This video, which I saw on teevee when it was a 'special', is some of the worst use of video tape ever. NOTHING on the tape remotely resembles anything in reality pertaining to the transport of special nuclear material or weapons, or train accidents, or, well, anything.

193626,5,1573627089,"First, having rode a steam powered train to Chicago, smelling that smoke and steam belched from the chimmney stack, it was great. The anticipation of the engineer throwing candy to us from the window in Mississippi. I loved choo choo trains, seeing that black smoke and white steam and of course the mournful whale of a sound as it receded off into the distance. When I came upon Atomic Train, I was curious about those diesels.  This television two parter was Terrific for me in many ways.  First, like an old Republic Pictures serial.

You know, non stop action, tension mounting cut a ways to family life and all of its complications. The officer and wife who come upon a traffic jam. This harden officer who orders everyone follow the fire engine and when there is rebellion, orders them to come along and follow, only to ask his wife, are they following, clever. There is action throughout, you hardly have time to take a breathe. One more discovery, the PAL DVD version of the film is different than the VHS version. There are several scenes missing from the PAL. The traffic tie up, interaction in the situation room, as well as scene from crash site. When and if you purchase, there is that difference. My VHS version is a little more dramatic. The PAL version otherwise crisp and clean video resolution.

It is a visual roller coaster ride, so I am saying All Aboard!!!, it is worth the FARE!!!!",1390348800,,1404,4.626506024096385

However this DVD has sub titles in Korean & I cannot delete them no matter what I did,added to the fact it freezes up & picture quality tends to be 'grainy' or 'snowy'.

Other tha that all seems ok & I'll perservere with the faults this DVD. I'm also after 3 other DVD's Fortress & Fortress 2 & Medusa's Child but am thinking twice about buying from a non Amazon store.

And it is the complete mini series, even though it says it is 96 mins. It has subtitles when it starts, but are easily removed. great movie!",1235952000,5,294,4.462962962962963
193644,2,1573627089,"I was surprised to see Rob Lowe in this movie.  Of course, Rob is one of the few good things in this movie that is yet another entry into the disaster genre.  Unfortunately, there are so many problems with this movie's plot that the producer should have fired the technical advisor or the director that failed to listen to him.

A train is traveling through the Rocky Mountains with a Russian nuclear missile secreted on board.  In addition to the nuclear missile are all kinds of hazardous waste, including metallic sodium, which essentially explodes on contact with water.  So, the train is rolling down hill for hundreds of miles into Denver when an air line on the train fails.  Wait.  That can not be right.

Let us check the facts.  Once you get just a little way west of Denver, you are on the other side of the Front Range and the slope goes down again.  Then how did the train go rolling for hundreds of miles into Denver?  I have no answer for that question.  Then there is an even more interesting question, which is why the train brakes failed to work when the air hose broke.  The air pressure in the hoses deactivates the brakes, not the other way around.  That way train cars will stop automatically when air lines open.  Then there is the caboose.  Cabooses have not been used in some time, except on rare occasions.  Maybe the whole train was hazardous.  It certainly seemed to be a couple of centuries behind the times.

If you can avoid the problems with this film, which are numerous, you find that this movie is much ado about nothing.  It is a bit more difficult getting a nuclear missile onto a train than you might think.  Even Soviet nuclear weapons do not explode easily, and Soviet weapons are notorious for being unreliable; i.e., they often do not work.

I found the whole premise of this movie implausible.  Now, had someone tried to dismantle the bomb to get the nuclear material, or had someone set the air to be on constantly, and put a tool box on the accelerator, and arranged for the metallic sodium to crash into a train loaded with Perrier, then there might have been a plot.  Instead, I was so caught up in the errors that I really had a hard time gaining any sympathy for any of the characters and what happened to them.  I found it difficult to feel badly for the people who died, because at least they did not have to be there for the end of this turkey.",1119744000,,2396,4.4279176201373
193645,5,1573627089,"My dad once told me, ""son, a movie isn't a movie if someone doesn't get injured and/or killed by an owl."" Last month I realized how incredibly true that is. I also realized my dad never said that.

  The film industry was done a freaking favor when director (genius) David jackson took over the reigns on this thoroughbread of a movie. Certain words come to mind after watching a film of this calliber. Most of these words I cannot type, for children may view this, but here are a few: ""what?"" ""huh?"" and ""why!?""

  After watching Atomic Train my best friend jumped out of the window of our hotel after saying only, ""I have seen all there is to see!"" He was right. Not a day goes by that I kick myself for not jumping out of that window as well.

  But in all seriousness that owl was David Bowie from The Labirynth right?",1112486400,6,822,4.285714285714286
193646,1,1573627089,"Watching this movie, was like....well, it was like watching a train wreck.  I couldn't stop watching it despite how painfully bad the whole movie was.  You can read some of the other reviews for some of the endless flaws in the plot line.  Anyways, my point is this: don't buy this movie.  You'll just end up wasting two hours of your life.",1108166400,2,340,4.435483870967742
193647,2,1573627089,"See other reviews for plot info, I won't repeat it. Apparently the makers of this movie didn't know anything about geography or railroads.

300 Miles west of Denver is the other side of the mountains.  The train would have to go uphill 150 miles or so, before it could even begin to coast down.

The setting is supposedly modern, yet the train contained cars that have not been in service since the 80s, including a caboose!?  The box car containing the ""bomb"" was modified with a roof walk and side bars so the actors could climb on it.

  One of the major malfunctions of the train was a broken air line so the train couldn't stop.  In reality when the line breaks and looses the air, the brakes come on automatically.

  The throttle of the locomotive got stuck on.  No problem, all the engineer had to do was take his foot off the ""dead man"" pedal, and the train would stop (In the ""Silver Streak"" the bad guy used a tool box to hold it down.)  After that, even though the engineer had no control of the train, he remained in the engineer's seat instead of trying to help out.

  The hero tried to short out the ""booster"" in order to slow it down, but earlier the engineer had said the dynamics wouldn't stop it.  Even if this would have worked, it would have been much easier just to disconnect the wires (called MU cables) that hook the two locomotives together.

  And the worst thing of all. Each car has its own manual brake. Can you imagine five trainmen and a man who investigates train wrecks not knowing that. Several shots that show the people trying to stop the train also show the brake wheel in clear view.  ""Hey stupid, turn the wheel behind you!""

These things and others (like people in panic trying to steal an auto in one scene, yet 10 seconds later the owners leave the vehicle to help someone but no one steals it?) ruin any plot credibility of the rest of the show.

As my spouse said, ""If that movie is so bad why are you watching it?""  It was a good question and as such I turned it off and don't know or care how it ended.",1098662400,8,2050,4.29242819843342
193648,3,1573627089,"Atomic train is one of those ""In between"" TV films. It is not bad, but it is by no means good. The movie is about a runaway train heading towards Denver with a nuclear bomb inside one of its cars. The engineers an't stop it, so one man, a train wreck investagator, John Seger (Rob Lowe) goest out to try and get the situation under control.
Now, I just saw this on Sci-Fi a few days ago. The action scenes were well done, but some of the acting could have been much better. Also, there are a few holes in the plot that were extreamly noticeable, and during the course of the film there are many chances to stop the train that are overlooked. (i.e, when a crew member on the train is leaning against the hand break of one of the frieght cars and says ""How the hell do we stop this thing""). But other than that, this was a good movie. If you like trains, you should see it at least once.",1090022400,2,885,4.091954022988506
193649,4,1573627089,I took a chance on buying the movie Atomic Train. I have never seen it before or knew anyone that has. I based my decision on the title and the reviews I read on Amazon. Knowing that it was a made for TV flick my expectations was low. I have watched the movie twice now and I am glad I bought it. The basic story is a stowaway nuclear bomb on a runaway train. Will the train crash and set off the bomb? I will not give much away but to say there are a few surprises. Being a TV movie you have your soap opera elements but not as bad as I had expected. The special effects are good and the acting decent. There is a short making of the movie on the DVD. If you like trains and action you probably won't be disappointed.,1080086400,4,718,3.9246575342465753
193650,5,1573627089,"This movie inspired Sean Smith's character, Chance Stubbles, in the groundbreaking movie, Momma's Boy. Momma's Boy is the funniest movie ever made. It combines hilarious situations with an outstanding cast. So forget this movie, go watch Momma's Boy, starring Sean Smith.",1076371200,,271,5.634146341463414
193651,3,1573627089,"Okay so this film was pretty cheesy but let's be honest there have been worse that have been screened and have even won Oscars, so lets not be judgemental okay?
Rob Lowe does a pretty passable job as the jaded Train Crash expert John Seager trying to hold his family together, rebellious teenage daughter Grace, shy and gentle step-son Chance plus a sassy young wife with a chip-on-his-shoulder Cop for an ex-husband.
The plot is fairly simple and perhaps a little long winded.  Nuclear Bomb ends up on a train conveniently sitting next to some highly inflammable chemicals; train has a REALLY bad leaky break problem.  Enter Rob Lowe, a bunch of army guys, a gung-ho General who wants to blow the train off the mountain (this actor plays General Hammond in Stargate by the way!) a rather goofy good hearted President of the USA and an assortment of heroes, heroines, goodies and baddies all putting in their 10 cents worth..
The train ends up behind derailed and the bomb explodes, and the disaster movie becomes a disaster movie twice over.
The special effects are not bad, the acting ditto, a bit hammy but like I've said, there's worse out there in cellular city.  The movie does however lack any real suspense, and of course you have the cheesy family reunions , rescues, tears and tantrums, plus the obligatory resentful step-daughter embracing her step-mother near the end of the film.
You also get some terribly embarrassing speeches from the President but hey why on earth not?  You've got everything else in this kitchen sink of a film, why not some heart-felt speeches to give it a little patriotic zip?
All in all though, its not a bad little film to wile away a really boring evening, I've seen worse and at least with this film, I won't loose my way in the plot, so I can nip out and make a cup of tea and still know where I am when I get back!",1073865600,,1858,4.553892215568863

You have a runaway Atomic Train that is headed straight to Denver unless John Seger (Rob Lowe) and other officials can stop it.  IF they can, what will happen if the bomb should explode due to damage to the train?  In this nail-biting movie which is just under 3 hours, you will find out the answers and see how this kind of experience brings out the best (and worst) in people. Those who like disaster films and suspense  films will most likely enjoy it along with Rob Lowe fans.  I guess I would say teens on up as there are a few scenes that younger children would have trouble with.
No sexual content, but some mob mentality violence and death, including that of a parent.  I did enjoy it though my thumbnail may not have.  Enjoy your train ride!",1416873600,,924,4.431952662721893

This movie does have a lot of flaws, but in all honesty this movie is just pure entertainment and that is why i like it. A weapons contractor wants to go cheap, and decides to ship a nuclear bomb on a train, hidden as something else, but when the train looses breaking control the train runs 300 miles down hill to denver. I thought the movie had very good effects for being just a TV Mini series, and had similar effects to the titanic that was made for NBC. Sometimes people get so mad at this movie for existing but it is what it is, an entertaining movie for almost 3 hours. Enjoy it!",1399334400,,686,4.204545454545454
