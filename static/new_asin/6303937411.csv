May 26, 1996

Florence Civic Center

Florence, South Carolina

Marc Mero V. Hunter Hearst Helmsley

ok opener that was watchable and could have been better. These two will have alot better matches in October. Mero wins. **1/2

Now, Stone Cold's music starts and then out of no where, the powerm goes out. Then Vince is shown minutes later and says that there was a huge thunderstorm in the Florence area and we are going to go to the main event. so...

WWF Championship:

Shawn Micahels (Champion) V. British Bulldog

Good match that had a weird ending. The ref gets bumped and Micahels & Dog go back and forth and then another ref comes in and Micahels hits a German on the Dog and one ref comes in & counts Dog's shoulders down & one ref counts Micahels shoulders down and we have a Draw. ***1/4

Now hold on, the fans who were in the arena got to see the other three matches and they were held that night in dark matches and they were actually in the dark. However, what about the PPV audience. They only saw two of the five matches. The WWF decide to air the other three matches in their tuesday night replay slot, and the also aired the two matches that were live sunday. so...

Beware Of Dog II: In Your House

May 28, 1996

North Charleston Coliseum

North Charleston, South Carolina

Carribean Strap Match:

Savio Vega V. Stone Cold Steve Austin

awesome match that I thought would have sucked because all strap matches are the same but not this one. Awesome match with Vega winning ***3/4 This marks Ted DiBiase's last WWF Pay-Per-View appearence because he will be leaving for WCW in a few weeks

Yokozuna V. Vader

horrible big man match that was actually fun to watch because of the size of these two. Vader wins *1/4 and I think is was Yoko's last WWF PPV too. Wow!

Casket Match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship:

Goldust (Champion) V. Undertaker

good match that was better than I thought it would have been. Goldust wins because of Mankind. **3/4

Overall, a good show with a very bizzare situation with it.",1138665600,,2062,4.513513513513513
