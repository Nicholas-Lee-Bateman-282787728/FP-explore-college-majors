About an hour (two lectures) cover the basics of Real Flow and the remaining three hrs or so cover three or so different techniques.

The DVD-ROM is from 2007 however, so only Mac PowerPC will play these discs (OSX on/after 10.2, but not Intel-based chipset machines)... Windows XP and 2000 works, but cannot speak to later version of Microsoft O/S.

I think Gnomon also offer online courses, so if these DVD-ROMs can't be played on your devices, an option for you might be to get a subscription for a month or two and cover these lectures (if they're available.)",1355270400,,781,4.686131386861314
