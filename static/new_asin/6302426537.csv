462921,3,6302426537,I have only watched it once and it's not a memorable movie for Jack Lemmon.  It's only somewhat entertaining for me.,1414627200,,116,4.523809523809524

462923,5,6302426537,"Great movie.  Jack Lemmon and, well Jack Lemmon is enough for me and this movie has a great ending.  Besides the middle part where he takes a job riding bikes; suffice it to say, when he came home was the funniest part of the movie.  Don't hesitate on this one.",1376524800,,261,4.18

462927,3,6302426537,"A father who have never enjoyed life without working, has given everything he needed to his son his whole life long. This caused the son to grow up with neither a reason nor a motivation to find working as much interesting.
When the father realizes it, can no longer live with this reality, and start a two year wandering in order to find himself.

He will be back with a new knowledge: We can love someone also without being proud of them.
He will have acquired some more - a new life philosophy: the ability to relax, and enjoy life being totally financially supported by his son. This, in turn, will then have discovered the pleasure of working, and for a completely different reason: as a way to pay back life for what life had given to him in the first place. A much ""nobler"" concept of working.

The man's wife will also have found back the joy of working, and for her it will mean making things.

A nice story which leads even the inattentive spectator to realize that there are different values than the ordinary ones, for most aspects of life, even those that are apparently most stable and univocal.",1222128000,,1109,4.48019801980198
462928,4,6302426537,This was an entertaining movie. The twists and turns are sometimes hard to follow but the movie has a satifying ending. The down side of the film would be the character of the son. I would have liked to see this role be a little stronger. Pop the corn and cozy up to the television for a comfortable time.,1221782400,,305,4.186440677966102
7825726,3,6302426537,Amusing but not hilarious comedy of ethics work and socially has some funny but unremarkable moments. Good cast and direction.,1518825600,,126,5.35
7825727,3,6302426537,Love Jack Lemmon but this was so formulaic it was disappointing,1518307200,,63,4.818181818181818

7825729,5,6302426537,"I forgot all about this movie until I came across it on internet. Wow what a blast from the past. This movie was and is still so funny and good
even more so today. Jack Lemmon was still at his best playing comedy and drama in the same movie. A successful wealthy man who
realizes he's spoiled his son so much that he is not motivated to WORK and just takes for granted his easy life decides to give away all
his money and put his family in the poor house but his son doesn't change. After working 3 jobs and not being able to return to his former
glory and his son marries for money he disowns his son and leaves his wife after she decides to work again. Coming back 2 years later
he finds things have changed for his wife and son. I won't ruin the end of the movie. This is a great movie for the entire family especially
today in this leftist snowflake world where the media and politicians push this lazy freestyle life to younger generation as a positive message.",1495929600,,966,4.198924731182796
