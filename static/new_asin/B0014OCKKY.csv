3134170,4,B0014OCKKY,"MISSING IN ACTION and MISSING IN ACTION: THE BEGINNING

Just in time for his big screen comeback, these two Chuck Norris favorites arrive on blu-ray disc. Coming from the less than believed producers Golan-Globus, the Cannon logo never looked more gloriously cheesy than it does in high definition, these 80's ""gems"" are a part of the whole lets go back and win the Vietnam conflict wish fulfillment fantasies of the Reagan/Bush era. On that scale of things, these two pictures come on the short end, not living up to the high mark leveled by Sly Stallone with Rambo: First Blood Part II or Gene Hackman and his all-star crew in the much needed on blu-ray Uncommon Valor.

As it is, these are the film the legend that is Chuck Norris is probably best known for. The first picture is by far the better of the two, which producers Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus knew, because actually these two pictures where shot in reverse order, but once the mini-moguls saw the flicks, they new that they had one turkey and one half way decent programmer on their hands.

 Here starring as Col. James Braddock, the role he was born to play, Chuck leads a rescue mission for MIAs still kept prisoner in Vietnam years after the war. Aided by a bullet proof raft, a never ending supply of ammo and a better than this movie deserves partner in character actor M. Emmet Walsh. This works pretty nicely as guilty pleasure escapist entertainment that still holds up fairly well. Hear the Chucksaurus roar.

MIA 2 on the other hand is whole different beast. Cheap and shoddy looking, it feels like a real bad TV episode from the era. With Chuck easily out acting, yes you read that right, most of the rest of the cast. This movie is just a sloppy, silly mess with a storyline so absurd that it almost has to be seen to be believed. Although, it must be said that at times the flick goes so far over the edge as to be comically, making it often so bad that it is funny, if not exactly good. A twice over infinity of internet jokes were born right here.",1346630400,,2029,4.472972972972973
3134171,4,B0014OCKKY,"Missing in action: This is a good movie It adresses a few issues about that war that many War movies of the 80's adress about American POW's and How getting them out of that Nation was even in the 80's rather hard to do. It is a Chuck Norris Style of Action Flick and good Eye candy.

Missing in action 2: This Movie is a Prequel to the Orginal movie.  There is a Part in the Orginal Film that Mentions Colonel Braddock Was a POW and Killed the people who held him and Escaped... This Movie Covers that and adresses a few issues with how American POW's in that nation were treated. It is yet more Chuck Norris Eye candy with His style of 80's action.

Missing in Action 3: This movie Adresses yet more Issues with that War, That Nation and the people who lived there and/or got left behind. It has more of your Chuck Norris Eye candy action and the Action is alot better as this film was made in 89.

All three films are your typical War time 80's Action Movies.

If your not a Chuck Norris Fan you won't like these films,  If your not a 80's action fan your not going to enjoy these movies.
But if you are these three films are great Eye candy and realy takes ya to those era's",1303603200,2,1178,4.122270742358078

3134174,4,B0014OCKKY,"The Mission In Action series only served one purpose: to entertain. Anybody with a lick of sense knows not to watch B-movies from the 80s with high expectations. If you're looking for quality look elsewhere but if you want mindless action flicks to pass the time then this series should do the trick.

Missing In Action 1: 4 stars

Braddock has to free some captured servicemen from Vietnam plus he is also being threatened with jail time for the murder. Braddock with the help of a good friend go back to ""Nam"" to rescue them.

The acting is stiff as a board but the action scenes are plentiful. The slow-mo water sequence is one of the best scenes in action B-movie history. Even though this movie is as dopey as they come it's still a lot of fun which I cant say for many of the movies that come out nowadays.

Missing In Action 2: The Beginning  2 stars.

Hmmmm, I always found this one to be the weakest of the series. The storyline is that Braddock and his comrades are tortured by Colonel Yin. Unfortunately that is the whole movie in a nutshell. Braddock and his men get tortured by Yin and Braddock ends up escaping. Not much action here and its kind of bland. The final fight scene between Colonel Yin and Braddock is weak. Braddock just beats the hell out of him and that's it.

Braddock: Missing In Action 3  4 stars.

This one is a step up from part 2. Braddock goes back to Saigon after hearing that his wife and son might still be alive. There are some swell action sequences here and some laughable ones too. The villain is hilarious especially when he yells BRADDOCK BRADDOCK BRADDOCK! after failing to kill Braddock who seems to have more lives than a cat. It was more fun than the second sequel and remains the best sequel to the series.

Conclusion: If you love the Missing In Action series you cant go wrong with this deal. The picture quality is pretty good and Missing In Action is in Full Screen and Wide Screen. Missing In Action 2 and 3 are only in Full Screen. Only recommended to the fans of the Missing In Action series and no one else.",1242259200,4,2065,4.382198952879581
