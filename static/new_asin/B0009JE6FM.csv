2294454,4,B0009JE6FM,"I used to watch this, just because it was on before Jack of all Trades.  I kind of got to ""like"" it, I guess, it had hot women running around in hot outfits.  The stories were about these three girls who live underground in the far away future;  the surface of the planet is ruled by evil robots, and androids are lurking underground.  So these girls are always fighting against the bad guys.  The stories are more or less silly, the special effects aren't all that great BUT I have to give these folks points for originality.  They had some pretty cool gadgets, like a computer you wore on your wrist that could project a 3-D holographic image of various things.

All in all, it was cheesy, silly, had a lot of action, and I guess I mentioned all the hot babes.  Okay, the only reason anyone would watch this is for the babes, but, that certainly sets it above all the equally stupid whows without hot babes, so there you go.",1121472000,124,926,4.343023255813954
2294455,1,B0009JE6FM,"I have seen a few episodes of this show when it was on TV.  Maybe I am missing some of the intentional cheese or whatnot,  but this show blows.  It has poor acting, cliched storylines, low budget, and seems like you get dumber after you watch it.  They say every show has a fan but I find it hard to believe anyone likes this disaster.  I got an e-mail from Amazon pointing this train wreck out to me.  I laughed out loud.  Look guys, if you want some good sci-fi, go after shows like Farscape, the new Battlestar Galactica, and Firefly.",1121040000,19,537,4.257425742574258
2294456,4,B0009JE6FM,"This series was a little bit of cheese, a little bit of creative innovation, a lot of sci fi, a lower budget than you'd hope for (but really squeezed to make the most of things) and overall, great fun.

The best innovation this show had was that all the bad guys didn't have to miss the good guys all the time when firing hail after hail of energy blasts at them from all angles.  The good guys (good girls, actually) had personal energy shields that would deplete over time and only then would you really have to duck every shot or hope they still missed you all day long.  (Why on earth hasn't every sci fi action series snaked this idea and run with it, too?)

Anyway, there is a fair amount of humor that really works and some actual hard-core sci fi here and there.  Mostly it was all about the action, though.  Cheesy villians more often than not, but the over-arching enemy presence throughout was a race of huge, crazy-looking robots that ruled the surface of Earth in the far future, which were pretty cool, but not around in every episode.

Eventually, as the story went from half-hour shows to hour-longs, the writing got better, or maybe there was more room for story when the action quotient didn't have to be jacked up so high.  Don't get me wrong, this was no epic story and it was never going to be, even though it got cancelled before its time (there is quite a cult following and more episodes were written and offered up on some website at some point, though never actually filmed).

If it comes out at a decent price for your budget, and you're into a fast-paced, light-weight sci fi romp, grab it up.  Oh yeah, the main characters are athletic female actors who have all shown up in higher-profile projects since this and all fall into the category of ""hot"" . . . but that's actually not the best reason to watch.",1119312000,41,1834,4.415430267062314
2294457,4,B0009JE6FM,"Love the premise: a stripper goes in for breast enlargement surgery only to wake up to find it is now the year 2525. Cleopatra has been in cryo-stasis all this time and now serves as the comic relief for a ""charlie's angels"" group fighting robots in the future.... what's not to love about that?  Cleopatra is very cute, plus you have the chick from Mutant X, and the gal from Serenity (and had a recurring guest character on Angel and Alias).  The special effects are weak... but Sci-Fi is like pizza.... even when it's bad, it's still pretty good.  This started off as a split timeslot with that Bruce ""Ash"" Campbell show called of Jack of something or other.... Bruce Campbell is a god.  I've rambled enough.",1115596800,44,711,4.574803149606299

It' a thrilling cosmic kaleidoscope of high speed comic-book ACTION combined with sharp wity dialogue, fantastic costumes and set designs bursting with primary colors, tight rapid-fire editing..and last but not least some of the most sexy babes(like Nakita's -Pete Wilson) to ever hit the tv screen.

2294494,5,B0009JE6FM,"Cleopatra 2525 is back from the 90's in this boxset containing the series 28 episodes. 3 sexy women fight to return the human race to the surface of earth after being forced underground by A.I. gone rogue. In their quest our three heroines face off against mutants, cyborgs, a telepathic villainess & Joel Tobeck doing a pretty great Joker impression. All of them are powerless against the girls bare midriffs & ample cleavage.

The show may be cheesy but the special effects, set design, costume design & music are all pretty uncanny for what had to be a low budget show. Jennifer Sky, Victoria Pratt & Gina Torres all due terrific work! Their performances all on point & make the physical demands of their roles look easy(and hot). This show was doing that wuxia wire work even before The Matrix. Green screen special effects are commonplace now but this show was doing them 12 years ago.

One of the women is Cleopatra who was accidentally frozen and woke up in 2525. There is a slight resemblance to Tank Girl. The dystopian outfits are great.

That said, some of the sci-fi elements and ideas are interesting, and for such a ridiculous show, the majority of the acting is pretty darn good. The people that gave us Xena, Hercules and Andromeda did this show. Think of it as Andromeda on acid and full-fast-forwarded with the volume cranked to crack the ceiling and you're getting close.

2294539,2,B0009JE6FM,"Huh, I didn't know that patients are put into cryogenic freezers if complications arise during breast augmentation surgery. Well, apparently that's what happens, and for some reason you get thawed out 525 years later. Ever see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Farscape/dp/B002GP7ZWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Farscape</a>? 2525 is perhaps what Farscape might have been if Farscape had lacked the following: a budget, an addictive story arc, convincing special effects, enthralling three-dimensional characters, or creativity run amok. The only reason to care about our 3 heroines in 2525, really, is that the show would be just godawful without them. But why waste your time when there are so many good serials to watch these days?

The episodes are short in season 1 (23 or so minutes) but this length is doubled in season 2 (both seasons are included in this set).
I recommend NOT trying to binge-watch 2525, as brain damage could occur.

PROs
 Female protagonists who display strength and resourcefulness (well, except for Cleopatra)
 Victoria Pratt as Sarge: her toned physique is always on display as she runs around in athletic gear that seconds as her character's outfit
 Executive producer Sam Raimi (although he may or may not have had any actual influence over the project)
 Costumes: despite some gaudy KISS villains, 2525 going over the top with most of the getups is what keeps things from getting too boring
 Fans: apparently 2525 has its diehard devotees (which suggests some kind of redeeming quality to it)

CONs
 Would you like some cheese with your sci-fi? (Or is it sci-fi sprinkled on cheese? Hard to tell)
 Viewing quality remains practically the same when you watch it with the volume off
 Aired in 2000-01, but seems more like a show from 1990-91
 Fight scenes become tiresome about 5 seconds after they start...and they happen about every 10 seconds
 In case you didn't get the memo: Gina Torres staring in a series doesn't automatically make it good

They fight evil machines in what appears to be most similar to The Matrix meets the Terminator. People hiding underground fighting cyborgs bent on killing all human beings while machines run the surface of Earth.

2294586,5,B0009JE6FM,"Cleopatra 2525 debuted in early 2000 and was a show I immediately grasped,latched onto and savoured,enjoying the subsequent ride;as surprisingly short as it was. And there WAS much to savour.
This half hour series was the first half of an ""Action Pack"" hour;the latter half consisted of ""Jack of All Trades""(available separately on DVD),starring Bruce Campbell and the weakest of the two. From the same team that produced the hit shows Hercules,starring Kevin Sorbo and Xena,starring Lucy Lawless,including many of the same actors,production team and the fabulous stunt teams,came Cleopatra 2525.
The series starred Gina Torres,Jennifer Sky and Victoria Pratt. Its story premise was future Earth circa 2525 where Cleopatra(Sky)is woken from a very long cryo freezing(over 500 years) and forced to start life anew. Her new friends include Sarge/Rose(Pratt) and Hel/Helen(Torres),who are constantly baffled by Cleos many 20th Century colloquialisms. Most of the Earth's population fled underground many,many years before and it is filled with thousands upon thousands of interconnected vertical shafts,going down hundreds to thousands of feet. Sarge and Hel have been given the task of ""policing"" it and battle many of its' crooked denizens such as their arch enemy Creegan,while trying to defeat the flying machines who control the Earths' surface;the ""Bailies"".Hel has an implant in her head through which the ""Voice"" assigns the teams' various tasks and helps them during same,if need be. As the show progresses Cleo gets progressively more confident with her friends and protectors but can never fully shake her insecurities and when the situation gets rough can revert back in a split second to a screaming non-functional,huddling in a corner.
As with Hercules and especially Xena(both filmed in New Zealand),the shows special effects and stunts are absolutely top notch. The scripts run fast,the story lines are smooth,the editing is crisp and the actors hit their marks each and every time. The characters array of armour and weaponry were inspired ideas and the make up department did beautiful work throughout. Of course the main character's obvious feminine pulchritude certainly didn't hurt this show in the least but if it had relied solely on just that and had weak story lines then it would have been an unmitigated disaster. But in fact it is just the opposite which makes me even more perplexed concerning its' short run.
One possible explanation could be the way it was sold. As I stated previously this show was part of an hour long format and joined with another much weaker one. This weaker link may have been enough to deep six both of them.
Technically this show has been transferred wonderfully onto DVD and it is generally quite crisp and clear throughout. The special features are rather sparse however with only a few deleted scenes,outtakes and a short on the great stunt work. The packaging for some reason states there are 30 eps but there are in fact only 28!
This DVD's major flaw is of course its' packaging. Many companies use the double sided disc format but Universal and MGM seem especially enamoured of their usage,much to this reviewers chagrin. It is a CHEAP way of producing and issuing DVDs with a guarantee of maxing the profit margin. It is also the POOREST way from a consumer and practical standpoint as DVDs are notoriously scratch and scuff prone and issuing a double sided DVD is just asking for trouble right out of the starting gate. To top this off is the way this particular three disc set sits in its' case. The third disc sits alone and by itself but the first two are layered,one over the other. The top disc sits half way out and over the bottom one and one false slip of the finger and whammo,either disc can be scratched. I finally found that the only way of lifting the top disc safely is by placing the thumb on the middle spindle while the others are outside of the area. Depressing the spindle releases the disc which you lift slowly until you are able to gingerly grab the outside of the disc. It is VERY tricky and can take awhile to master. I also learned that once you have that first disc out it is best to place it into a separate jewel case until you finish watching both sides. The less you have to go through getting it out each time you want to see it the less are the odds you will damage it. It is totally asinine to have to go through such an ordeal once let alone repeatedly,which shows a total lack of consideration not only for the product but we the buying public.
Furthermore this set is WAY over priced for what you get. I don't usually complain about pricing but for this amount Universal should have released both Cleopatra and its' ""Action Hour"" brother ""Jack of All Trades"" together;showing them as they were released with the relevant bumpers and lead ins. It is price gouging at its' ugliest.
In conclusion though we have a big fat zero on the packaging front,we do have a big five stars for the series itself. Edgy,hip and action filled this show was about the fastest and edge of your seat half hour(about 21 1/2 minutes to be exact) that I think  have ever seen on television. Created and produced by the same fabulous team that gave us Hercules and Xena and culled with many of the same familiar actors,this series was a revelation and still packs an intense wallop even viewing it after nine years. It may have been prematurely canceled but it still shines brightly and I recommend it highly.",1242432000,5,5482,4.838125665601704
2294587,5,B0009JE6FM,"""In the year 2525...""
Yes, it might be the cheesiest show ever made, but it had good special effects for the time, still better than most series. If you watched them on their original run, they are worth their weight in gold for the nostalgia value.",1219968000,,249,4.434782608695652
2294588,2,B0009JE6FM,"There's something for everyone out there, or so the saying goes.  Well this something really isn't for me.  Based on Amazon's description I wasn't exactly expecting something hugely competent since it appears the main goal was to make the sexiest sci-fi on TV.  While that may be a noble goal, there needs to be more than just beautiful women to really get me into a show.  Sci-fi needs to seriously appeal to my intellect on some kind of a level, and this show does try that, I was just expecting something a little more.  Anyway, I really snagged this because I saw that Gina Torres was in this show and she is also in ""Firefly"" and I really enjoyed ""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"" a lot.  So I figured why not, this is probably half-way decent.  Boy were my expectations still too high.  I mean it is really cheesy, and maybe it's supposed to be because it's pretty goofy overall.  I'm not sure, because it's mingled with very serious concepts and moments, so I'm up in the air for what the authors were really going for.

So, the premise of the show is that the Earth has been taken over by these machines called Bailies and mankind has been driven into the underground.  As you can see this is a highly original concept.  No one has ever thought of this before, certainly not in the Matrix.  Things are a little less orderly with the human population in ""Cleopatra 2525"" though.  So there are these Special Forces teams of sorts, kind of like in the Matrix, where they try to fight against the Bailies.  They're called voice teams and it's organized by this voice, aptly named ""Voice"", who pulls it all together.  Only the team leader has the voice implant in her head so she can hear Voice all the time.  Hel, played by Gina Torres, is the team leader and while she and Sarge were in a battle they ended up in a cryogenic facility where Cleopatra was accidentally thawed out.  She's an exotic dancer, but they decide to have her be part of the team anyway.  Most realistic and best idea ever!  I realize the warrior woman concept is hugely popular; I love it myself, but at least have some good writing!  Take Xena for example; that at least had pretty interesting stories and Lucy Lawless can actually act!  Jennifer Sky, Cleopatra, did a terrible job in this show.  She absolutely overacted almost every single scene.  Maybe that's what they wanted her to do?  But seriously, twenty-eight episodes... it just gets annoying after a while.  They gave her terrible lines to follow also, like goofy sayings from the 20th century that everyone in our time knows, but no on knows in 2525, they just sound incredibly goofy.  Not to mention their arch nemesis is this guy named Creegan who has his face painted like a clown and has bright red hair.  Yes, horrifying person... except he's dressed in red vinyl.  Maybe this is some relation to the scary clown concept like in ""It"" or ""Killer Clowns from Outer Space"", who knows, either way it seems like a bad idea.

Okay, that's basically everything I didn't like about the show mingled with what the shows general premise was.  I seriously struggled through this show.  Episode after episode of grueling bad acting and just as bad writing.  Why is everyone dressed like they're at a Goth dance club anyway?  I seriously have a hard time figuring this out.  I like seeing girls in tight leather or vinyl as much as the next guy, but the whole population?  Despite all this eye candy it was still tough to make it through the series.  Anyway, I'm glad I did, because I did find something positive after a while.  On the second half of disc two, the story-line featuring Creegan actually gets really good and intriguing.  You learn a lot more about Creegan's history and Hel's.  In the end Creegan ended up being my favorite character.  He was actually one of the stronger actors in this series as well, actually better than Hel in my opinion.  This is, of course, all despite his looks.  I also liked the way the series ended, it was definitely somewhat unexpected from my end and I thought it had a strong ending.  Yes, you find out who voice is.  This is really what got it the extra star, unfortunately the strength the last episodes had couldn't save the whole series.

Overall, this was a tough series to get into.  The fact it's pressed on dual-discs didn't help me with my rating either, though I'm not as disappointed since I won't be watching this over and over.  It has some cool ideas here and there in terms of Sci-fi, but there wasn't enough to really pull me in.  The acting by most of the characters was horrible and a lot of the scripts were weak.  The acting did get a little better as the series went on, but by then it was too late for me.  Honestly the next time these people decide to write a show, they should focus more on actually writing a good story rather than checking out their cast.  The sexual jokes in the script felt forced and out of placed and there's no seamlessness to the writing at all.  Lots of shows manage to incorporate good looking people with good writing, so I know it's a possible feat to accomplish.  Like I said before, there will certainly be many people who find this show great, but for me, I need a little more backing up my Sci-fi, sorry to those hardcore fans out there for giving this a low rating.",1214697600,5,5295,4.49475890985325

It is set in the future where Celopatra, after being cryogenically frozen after a bad b-augmentation job, wakes up and realizes it is the future and it is overrun by strange creatures. Humans live underground and her two new friends are sort of fighting for human kind. Many a reference to popular culture enter the show which makes it both fun an entertaining.

Great stuff for just plain fun.  I was a little disappointed that the extras were very skimpy, and the ""Earth 2"" episode a waste of time, but I did finally get to see the last few episodes of the series.  It appears to have vanished around here a little early.

The girls are a delight to watch, and Jennifer Sky's character is more than worth the price all by herself.

I don't remember the music being changed, but I do seem to recall a short segment in the episode where Cleo gets cloned having a slightly different scene wherein the clone can't do some horrible thing or other because she's absorbed the real Cleo's ""goodness"".  (Or maybe I glanced away....)

The special effects are actually very good for a budget 1st-season tv type show, and the attitude and delivery of the lines makes it a winner.  If you like shows like Buck Rogers, Jack of All Trades, other fun lighthearted type series then you may enjoy this, as I do.  Nice show!

2294597,2,B0009JE6FM,"I purchased this DVD because it starred Gina Torres, and I wanted to see some of her work before Firefly/Serenity. I suppose I should have read the blurb.

Gina Torres has become a much better actress since this series, and I believe that Victoria Pratt has also improved her acting skills. The acting in Cleopatra 2525 seems to be of only secondary importance.

Overall this series is not that bad, its a series of half-hour episodes, though it seems as if they became longer (maybe  extended to an hour) toward the end of the series. If I were to rate it on the series I would probably give it 3 1/2 stars, but I dislike the format. It was released as double-sided DVDs which irritates me and drops my rating down at least 1 point.

I can say, that if you enjoyed Farscape, MutantX, She Spies, V.I.P., and/or Xena, you will probably enjoy (like may be a strong word here) the series. If you are more interested in Andromeda, the various new Star Trek Series, Firefly, or Charmed, X-Files, Space: Above & Beyond, you may enjoy it, but you will find the plot lacking. If you are a fan of Drama or Action series like NCIS, J.A.G, Alias, or the various CSI storylines I would not suggest this for you.

The series is complete, but it wrapped up a bit too quickly, if the final episode is considered an ending. It never takes itself seriously, and it is far more in keeping with the Batman series featuring Adam West, than Buffy the Vampire Slayer series featuring Sarah Michelle Gellar. Actually, it is reminiscent of the Saturday morning entertainment in the late 70s/early 80s.

Again, I would have given it a higher rating had it not been for the format, but not that much of a higher rating.",1145404800,22,1693,4.498371335504886

Impressed with her wile and wits, Hel and Sarge quickly decide to make her a team member, performing different missions on the unspoiled surface, and far into the depths of the underground city, populated with different cultures, a medley of strange mutant creatures, and the ever present Bailey infiltrator ""betrayer"" robots.  Some of their best enemies include the clown-like but interestingly complex nemesis ""Creegan"", and the beautiful psychic murderess Raina.  And, amongst all the different challenges our heroines face, we hear the mysterious voice of ""Voice"" that speaks to team leader Hel via her implant, and controls the resistance underground movement intended to eventually free the surface from the ever present subjugation of the Baileys.

 Bonus materials include an ""Earth 2"" episode, Deleted Scenes, Outtakes, and Special Effect and Stunts.

 However, let the buyer beware of the words ""MUSIC MAY DIFFER FROM TELEVISED VERSION"" found in small print on the back of the outer box, for they have modified this region 1 release!  Take for example my favorite episode ""Run Cleo Run"", which includes a great beginning scene of Sarge dancing on stage to a group of mutant gangsters.  The fantastic song ""A Girl Like You"" by Edwyn Collins fires off and the show begins, observed remotely by Cleo, Hel and Mauser.  ""Shake that money maker!"" exclaims Cleo.  But on this DVD they replaced ""A Girl Like You"" with a lame song completely inappropriate for the situation.  Why didn't they leave it alone?  I can't believe they actually PAID someone to ""improve"" this episode!  I am very disappointed.  Who knows how many other episodes they played with?  Anyway, please realize that this North American release does not contain the complete original sound track.  For those interested in a sound track with the original songs, I suggest the first British DVD release.  However, you must then unfortunately contend with a different region and the PAL formatting instead of NTSC.

 In general, I recommend this release.  The humor, the action, and the characters all make this a thoroughly enjoyable science fiction series.  In fact, why it got cancelled in the first place still amazes me!  But it did, and we now have only these few episodes to enjoy.

These girls was naughty; what with their provocative squats and the scantily-clad nature of their almost-costumes.

Many people blame the cheesy scripts and amateurish acting for having gotten the show cancelled; the truth is that hate-driven little store-front ""churches"" all over America waged vicious letter-writing campaigns against the show and bullied their local stations into taking it off the air.

Thanks be to Bob Almighty that we were saved from these vixens' naughtiness by those good folks' moral superiority - we might've laughed out loud and offended Bob!

The very idea of an underground society of human beings fighting a ruling class of robots for survival is a blasphemous affront to the one-true-Bob (praise His Holy Name!).

2294605,5,B0009JE6FM,"You know, I never expected to write this. I never saw the show when it first aired or any syndication it might have had. I passed over the DVD many times in the store. It wasn't until a friend mentioned that he saw an episode or two that I even took notice. Then one day I just upped and bought it on a lark hoping to not be disappointed. I turned out quite surprised.

The show was a lot of fun! Sure it is like Charlie's Angels meets Batman (the campy one) meets Tribune Entertainment but you'll love it. The first season is all half hour format and the pace is pretty quick and the stories not overly difficult but they are engaging. Amazingly enough there is an actual story arc in the show and you can get an idea of a larger universe. It's not Star Trek in its depth or cohesion but they had a lot of fun ideas of their own.

The second season switches to an hour long format and more is revealed. I'm not sure why the series was cancelled but they seem to have known because in the final episode they reveal a number of secrets to the show but they leave as a cliffhanger. I suspect they thought they would have a special episode to finish or something but nothing happened. Maybe it was the lead in for Earth2? Don't know as I never watched it.

The DVD set has an episode of Earth2 (haven't watched it) and some minor extras like deleted scenes and a small commentary. The extras are not rated and do contain expletives (in spades).

2294607,5,B0009JE6FM,"I was so glad when this show finally came out on DVD on this side of the Atlantic, as I had been waiting years and years and during that time it had only been available in the UK for some weird reason.

So, is it a Sci-fi classic like ""Star Trek"" or ""Babylon 5""?  Well.....maybe not exactly.  But I would say that it definitely does deserve to be ranked right up there alongside other fun, cheesy old faves of mine like ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century"".

For those who've never seen it, the initial concept is actually quite similar to Buck Rogers.  But instead of a heroic astronaut getting frozen, this time it's ditzy blonde stripper Cleopatra (played by the versatile Jennifer Sky of ""Xena"" fame) who goes in for a breast enhancement but has complications and has to be frozen, only getting thawed out when mutant slavers stumble upon her stasis capsule while poking through ruins hundreds of years later in the 25th century.

Fortunately for Cleo, she gets rescued by a couple of roving futuristic warrior-wenches (Gina Torres of ""Firefly"" fame has never looked more drop-dead gorgeous than as the cool team leader ""Hel"" (short for Helen).  And she is ably assisted by her abs-of-steel, shoot 'em up sidekick ""Sarge"".)  The two take Cleo along with them on their adventures.

But unfortunately for Cleo, she must cope with a vastly changed earth.  Huge and deadly machines have taken over the surface world, and mankind has fled underground, building a vast network of tunnels.  But in these shadowy tunnels also lurk thieves, scoundrels, hideous mutants and even deadly cyborg ""betrayers"" sent by the machines to infiltrate and wipe the last vestiges of humanity out.

Sounds good so far right? -- So what was the problem and why did it get cancelled so soon?

Well, I'm not sure if it was the Fox Network or New Zealand-based show producers Studios USA (the same people who brought us ""Hercules"" and ""Xena"") who decided in their infinite wisdom that rather than giving it the same hour-long treatment they had given to these other two highly successful shows, instead it would have to be crammed into a brief half hour in order to share an hour of airtime with the putrid stinker of a Bruce Campbell show called ""Jack of All Trades"" (""Cleo 'n' Jack, back to back"" was the promo slogan they used to use).  So while I did love everything they managed to squeeze into their brief 30 minutes, I always felt that this show really should have been an hour long in order to allow them to tell the story properly.

But I think if the show had been given another year on the air, it could really have caught on.  The writers created a whole new universe for the characters that I was totally into.  There was a great chemistry between the three stars.  The sets and costume design were top-notch and suited perfectly the spirit of the new millennium.  It had a spirit of youthful exuberance to it that really reminded me of ""Logan's Run"" a quarter century earlier (characters over 30 are rarely seen).  The action sequences were amazing with the ladies blasting away with their laser gauntlets, and the way they could run up walls and do mid-air backflips was in the best Hong Kong kung-fu flick tradition.  And it had a playful sexuality to it (Sarge on their hunky male android assistant: ""He's not programmed for sex -- yet!"")

Yes, it had a lot of things going for it, and I think it was probably my favourite new Sci-fi show of the past few years (along with the new Battlestar Galactica of course).

R.I.P. Cleo.

The show's entire 30 episodes are contained on three double-sided discs.  Also included are stunt footage and bloopers, as well as a sample episode of another cancelled recent Sci-fi show, ""Earth 2"".  It would have been nice to have some commentaries or interviews with the Cleo stars, but I guess I should be glad just to have this available on DVD at all.

So if you're into ""serious"" Sci-fi, you probably won't like this.  But if you're in the mood for something light, fun and kinda cheesy (like Buck and Twiki, or Dr. Smith and the Robot) give this one a try and you just might be pleasantly surprised.",1122681600,2,4126,4.615068493150685
