8356536,5,B0028OH57C,"I may be a bit biased, since I live down the street and have moved cattle with some of the people interviewed in this awesome documentary, but it really is a great look at the history of cattle ranching in the West with a particular focus on Nebraska.  I got this for my dad even though we'd already seen it on PBS, because he liked it so much, and because it brings back a lot of great memories for him (he visited the Omaha stockyards with his dad, delivering cattle, when he was younger, and remembers to massive blizzard described in the documentary, too).  The interviews with people who were there and the great pictures and stories make this fun to watch for just about every cattleman or person who is interested in real Western history.",1356307200,,745,4.470588235294118
