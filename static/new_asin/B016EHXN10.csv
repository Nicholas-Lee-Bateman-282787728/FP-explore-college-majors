8736394,4,B016EHXN10,"Amazing performance and scenery.  Director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle has given a great sense of drama by incorporating live scenery as well as the stage-sets.  Pavarotti is far from a ""starving student"" in any costume, but his performance is, as usual unparalleled!  Ricardo Chailly has done a great performance with the orchestra & music!  Edita Gruberova as Gilda has a Fabulous voice - with all the appeal, perfect pitch, & effortless rendition for the part, and gives a great performance in this!  A treasure to view and own!",1474675200,,524,5.046511627906977
