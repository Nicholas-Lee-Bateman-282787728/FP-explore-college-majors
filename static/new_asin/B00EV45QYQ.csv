8609753,5,B00EV45QYQ,This workout is great! I really enjoyed it. It's definitely an advanced workout dvd. I'm intermediate and had a little trouble with some of the moves. I love kickboxing and it's my favorite fitness activity. This will definitely get you heart pumping. This workout will not disappoint you.  I'm not got to lie I had to stop the dvd a few times to catch my breath and compose myself. About about an hour long including the ab section. I highly recommend this dvd. But not for beginners.,1501804800,,485,4.574712643678161
8609754,5,B00EV45QYQ,"Heather is AMAZING on this DVD! SHAME on whomever is selling this at TWICE the price! It's worth $20 bucks (the price I paid elsewhere), but not $40. With that said, SO glad I purchased this, and didn't get price gouged doing so!",1449792000,,229,4.348837209302325
8609755,5,B00EV45QYQ,I take this on vacation with me. I have about 30 exercise dvds. This one is not boring. You get a great work out with visible results in your arms and abs.,1442448000,,155,3.875
8609756,4,B00EV45QYQ,This workout is fantastic!!! The combination of Heather and Patrick make a great video. The music is cued very well and the exercises really flow. There are four sets with each set repeating twice. Heather is a fantastic coach and I wish they would come out with a different video. She is full of energy but not the cheese kind. This workout is very aerobic and challenging. Be prepared to sweat.,1430956800,,396,4.591549295774648
8609757,5,B00EV45QYQ,"It is a fantastic workout.  I thought the intensity level would be moderate but it was super high.  Heather is amazing.

My only complaint would be it's very high impact, but that shouldn't deter anyone from getting this killer DVD!",1396569600,,232,4.75
8609758,5,B00EV45QYQ,Great workout - not sure why it's 39.99 on Amazon when you can get it on Patrick's own website for 19.95 or at Total Fitness DVD's for 19.95.........,1395705600,,149,4.357142857142857
8609759,5,B00EV45QYQ,"I love a challenge when it comes to workout dvd's, it helps fend off the boredoms and this one is definetely a challenge.
I love how fast paced it is and that the workouts are broken down into 10 minute routines. I highly recommend this. Well worth the price to break up the workout dvd monotony.",1390780800,,296,4.303571428571429
8609760,5,B00EV45QYQ,Great workout - challenging without being impossible.  I love that on days when I don't have much time I can pick segments and customize my workout.  Very happy with this purchase!!,1387411200,2,181,4.806451612903226
8609761,5,B00EV45QYQ,"This is the best DVD I have done in awhile!

It has 4 rounds of kickbox drills and then 1 bonus ab round.  Each of these sections is about 10 minutes.

The rounds have simple drills but lots of high impact moves thrown in.  My favorite is round 3, although it's probably the easiest.  There are a lot of harder moves thrown in like burpees and high jumps so if you don't like those you won't like this.  The 4 rounds are led by Heather and Patrick does the ab section.  The instruction is live and the instructors are very encouraging and have a good baneter with each other.  There are a few other exercisers demonstrating the moves.  It looks like everyone on set has kickboxing gloves on, but I didn't and I still worked up a very good sweat.  (And I have worked out most everyday for almost 14 years)

The ab section is done all on the floor and has moves like planks, mountain climbers, side planks, dolphin, and other moves on the back that look pilates or yoga inspired but they are definitely not easy.

Time goes by fast.  Highly recommend!!!",1382140800,7,1051,4.355670103092783
8609762,5,B00EV45QYQ,"This one really gets your heart rate up and leaves you in a pool of sweat.  A major calorie burner.  You will not get bored with this one, but it's definitely advanced!!",1382054400,3,169,4.25
