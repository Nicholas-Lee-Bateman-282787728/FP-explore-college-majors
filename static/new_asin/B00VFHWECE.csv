8709940,5,B00VFHWECE,Great movie! Funny from the beginning to the end. I saw this at the Seattle International Film Festival and have been waiting for this to become available. I highly recommend this movie!!,1437264000,,187,4.875
8709941,5,B00VFHWECE,"Saw this at the SIFF premier and can't wait to see how it translates to the small screen. Charming, funny, silly, and surprisingly sweet. Ride along with Tennis Pro, a Seattle band, as they head to Japan to try to make it big. The music is great, the characters are memorable, and you'll find yourself saying ""remember that scene when...."" for days afterward. This film is seriously enjoyable.",1433894400,3,393,4.794117647058823
8709942,5,B00VFHWECE,"Saw this at the Seattle premier, and it was awesome!

The characters were easy to relate to, and the story was believable. It was a really fresh take on comedy, with no unnecessary overacting and cheap gags, but instead was just a fun movie to watch. From the first scene on the toilet, writing a new hit, to the hilarious accommodations in Japan, to the beautiful cello solo, the movie just makes you feel good, and you will end up cheers for the band as they struggle for success abroad!
Bravo to the cast and crew, this movie is awesome!",1433808000,4,540,4.4
