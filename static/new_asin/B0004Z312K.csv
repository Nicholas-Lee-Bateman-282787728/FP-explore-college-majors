8036212,5,B0004Z312K,It is not true that the only color footage that came out o Europe during World War II was shot by George Stevens.  There were several examples of color footage including some shot by John Ford.,1416873600,,193,4.361111111111111
8036213,5,B0004Z312K,"This was a wonderful documentary when it was first released some twenty-five years ago and holds up very well today. Stevens is a filmmaker of many classic Hollywood films including ""Women of the Year,"" ""A Place in the Sun,"" ""Shane"" and ""Giant"" yet he is overlooked if not entirely forgotten today. This film makes a persuasive argument as to why that should not be so.",1350518400,4,369,4.6923076923076925

8036216,3,B0004Z312K,"Just one look at the film works of George Stevens, and it becomes obvious that he was an important director. His movies have become classics that have inspired other film makers. Here, his son and the stars that worked with him remember a man who was dedicated to his craft and who helped to shape the movie industry.

We start with Alice Adams, by now a classic Katharine Hepburn film. The pacing is discussed, its innovations are covered, and Stevens' knack for comedy is praised. Hepburn provides additional commentary. Next is Gunga Din, then Hepburn's teaming with Spencer Tracy, and the impact WWII had on Stevens' work as a director. This change is illustrated by his next movies including I Remember Mama, A Place in the Sun, Shane, Giant, The Diary of Anne Frank, and finally The Greatest Story Ever Told. Fans and collegues bring the experiences of making the films to life.

Some of his career is ignored, including his first stint with Hal Roach's Boy Friend series. As a fan of those films, some coverage would have been great to see.

Hardly any of Stevens' personal life is mentioned, so the documentary comes off slightly hollow. Anyone could dig up the films and make their own impressions. It would have been more exciting to hear about the man behind the movies. Still, there are some interesting bits, so this documentary is not a total loss. It will never be a must-have, though.",1185062400,8,1400,4.729508196721311
8036217,4,B0004Z312K,"George Stevens, Jr. pays loving tribute to his father in GEORGE STEVENS: A FILMMAKER'S JOURNEY.

  The documentary opens with a scene from Giant (1956) and quickly segues to a scene from Alice Adams (1935).  Appropriately enough.  Alice Adams was his first big feature and Giant was the next to last good movie he directed.  After The Diary of Anne Frank (1959) he directed a couple of real stinkers - The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965) and The Only Game in Town (1970), with Elizabeth Taylor.

  Most of this entertaining movie is devoted to Stevens' great movies, and there's a raft of them - Alice Adams, Gunga Din, The Best Years of Our Lives, and the list goes on.  Interspersed in some extended scenes from the movies are interviews with actors and actresses, producers and fellow directors.  This is a movie of praise, and it's a real treat for fans of old movies to get a chance to listen to Fred and Ginger talk about the `break-up' dance in Swing Time, Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. talk over film clips and color home movie 16-mm clips from the Gunga Din set, and Joel McCrea discussing the making of the wonderful war-time movie The More the Merrier.

  Also included is 16mm footage Stevens took in Europe during World War Two.  The only color footage, the movie tells us, to come out of Europe during the war.  A fun and fascinating appreciation of one of cinema's master directors.  Highly recommended.",1110672000,23,1426,4.685483870967742
