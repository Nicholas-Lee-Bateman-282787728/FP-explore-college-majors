8471827,5,B001B9QDT6,"This DVD changed the way I trained. After years of Traditional Martial Arts training I thought I knew it all, but the simplistic elements of defensive strategy presented by Sammy Franco gave me instant modification that works.

For the complete beginner to the advanced martial artist/self defense practitioner. Regardless of what you currently know about defensive techniques, you need this instruction. This quality training DVD gets straight to the point and can be understood instantly.

This DVD not only covers the positives of training with a CFA mindset (which is quickly understood), but also exposes major flaws in existing techniques currently being taught as viable defensive options. I have already changed some of my long term skills for the better since viewing this DVD. One view will change your training, without a doubt.
Without a solid defense, an effective offense can't be initiated. I recommend this DVD to anyone wanting the real deal.",1213920000,3,959,5.261437908496732
