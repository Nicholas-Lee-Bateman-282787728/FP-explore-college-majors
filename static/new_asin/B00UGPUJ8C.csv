8706681,5,B00UGPUJ8C,"Karen Kingsberry is my favorite author!  The book is better than the movie, but the movie was very good.  The only difference that I could see was that the biological father in the movie was presented as being nicer originally than in the book.  I love all of Karen's books and would like to see more books, as well as more movies!!!  Her work exceeds excellence!!!. She has a way of drawing you into the lives of the characters who deal with the same problems that all of us deal with, no matter how hard we try to make good choices....Christians and non Christians.  Her stories can bring you to tears, generate hope, and encourage you to hold on to your faith or even come back to it if you gave up on it.",1482969600,,708,4.253731343283582
