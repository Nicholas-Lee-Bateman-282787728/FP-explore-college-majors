8626323,3,B00GR4QTBM,"The message was good, but the sound quality needs a great deal of improvement. I also didn't like the audience attempt at interjecting themselves in the play. I mean, just shut up and watch the play. The audience were clapping and excited about certain aspects of the play that were integral. Two of the woman had issues with church because of how they were treated by church folks. Sometimes that message was lost on the viewers.",1516406400,,430,4.671052631578948
