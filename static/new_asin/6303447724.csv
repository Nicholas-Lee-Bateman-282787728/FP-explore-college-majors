644447,1,6303447724,"This film follows similar themes to the 1980s movie of the same title.
This film is terrible. It fails at every level. You'd expect that an alien having sex (breeding) with beautiful school-girls would at least make this a sexy film, & yet it's not even that, aside from the obligatory group-girl scene in a shower there's very little flesh here to oggle at. And as a sci-fi/horror film it's not scary at all - I can't even work out which genre the producers were aiming it because it fails at all levels. The acting is even worse than the 1980s version - but at least that one had a titlation factor in its favour.
There's heaps of plot faults and leaps of illogic.
Filmed entirely on the Isle of Man (U.K.) but made to look like someplace, U.S.A. - probably because the producers wanted to pretend that such a terrible film had to have been made in another country.",1029110400,2,867,4.425
644448,5,6303447724,"This video; although it contains only the first 10 years of Breeder's Cup meetings, is very useful. For those wanting to view the racetrack performances and characteristics of important stallions and broodmares, it provides an insight complimentary to the studbook and sales catalogue. It is also very thoughtfully presented, giving rare interview and off-track footage of the major players, including the owner of Wild Again, talking on the morning of the inagural meeting.
I recommend it to those interested in comparing horses of different eras, as well as contempories. Races between Ferdinand and Alysheba; Bayakoa and Go For Wand; Sunday Silence and Easy Goer, show the value behind the stud pricetags of some of the most valuable horses in history. As with racing everywhere, there are disappointments and tragedies; these are all in what is a terrific package of the first 10 years. I can't wait for the next one.",1010534400,7,921,5.1466666666666665
644449,2,6303447724,"Well, maybe not Mars, but some sort of mutant/alien/supernatural creature/force/entity needs women. For what, we don't know, nor do we ever learn. Nor do we (somewhat surprisingly) get the expected exploding  alien-baby from the body (a la Alien, Humanoids from the Deep, and a dozen  others you could probably rattle off if you thought about it).
There's  really not much to this film. It doesn't even have a lot of camp value.  There is some, though: The breeders only take virgins and somehow in the  midst of the metropolis (New York), all the female actors, from the teen  dancer/ingenue to the 30-something doctor to the 60+ bag lady are all  virgins.
But ultimately there's not much =there= there. The 1980  ""Humanoids From The Deep"" has a similar plot and a lot more camp  value (and Doug McClure) if you're looking for something like this.",962928000,5,848,4.833333333333333

644526,1,6303447724,It was a waste of my time watching this movie. I watched this through Amazon Prime so I couldn't ask for my money back.,1410393600,,119,4.0
644527,2,6303447724,"An alien riding a meteor -- Huh? -- crash lands on Earth, and begins impregnating Earth women. Specifically, very attractive college co-eds, whom we occasionally get to see nekkid.

The alien employs a highly complicated technique of impregnation, combining mind control, viscous white pus, and some other stages and elements. However, his technique varies from victim to victim, as if the director is simply tossing in a bunch of ""cool scenes,"" with little concern for consistency, much less internal logic.

DEADLY INSTINCTS has been accused of ripping off&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B003GXJ072/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>, but it has more in common with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breeders/dp/B00005K3O3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breeders</a>, a slightly superior, less boring, low-budget film about pretty much the same thing -- an alien that uses mind control and a viscous white pus to impregnate attractive young virgins.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breeders/dp/B00005K3O3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breeders</a>&nbsp;has the advantage of being shot in Manhattan's lower Eastside in the 1980s, giving it a gritty, street punk sensibility, similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Necropolis/dp/B006J6CDAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Necropolis</a>. Whereas DEADLY INSTINCTS was shot on Britain's Isle of Man, the set decor made up to resemble Boston, USA. Thus, unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breeders/dp/B00005K3O3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breeders</a>, DEADLY INSTINCTS is forced to hide or camouflage its locations, showing only bland and indistinct buildings and streets that could well be anywhere.

I knew we weren't in Boston, or even in the United States, because the attempts to convince me otherwise are so heavy-handed and obvious.

* The Boston police wear American flag patches on their uniforms. A good tipoff that these are not American cops. American police departments are local, so that cops wear the patches of their local jurisdictions, not national flags. I guess they don't know that in Europe.

* The Boston police cars have ""USA"" stickers on the trunk. That's totally pointless and is called ""trying too hard.""

* An oil refinery tank has a BANNER draped along its side, saying ""Boston Oil."" Now, I've NEVER seen an oil refinery tank -- or any metal tank -- with a BANNER draped over it. Metal tanks are normally PAINTED with their company's logo. I guess the filmmakers couldn't afford the cost of painting (and then removing the paint) a logo on the tank. Cheaper to just drape a banner over the tank.

Not that it matters much. Most of DEADLY INSTINCTS was filmed in nearly empty college rooms and dorms (budget too low to hire many extras) and passages beneath the city. (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breeders/dp/B00005K3O3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breeders</a>'s alien likewise hid in the city's underground passages.) So really, we could be anywhere. I assumed the film was shot in Canada until I learned otherwise.

Despite the subject matter -- drooling alien impregnates big-breasted, nekkid virgins -- I was bored through much of this film. Way too many of the usual shots of characters wandering aimlessly in darkened passages, chit-chatting, making dumb, snarky, or vapid remarks before -- Finally! -- being picked off by the alien.

The main characters are a thirtyish hunk of a college professor who bares his chest to bed the lead lady -- a blond co-ed who wears skimpy clothes when she's not altogether nekkid.

The police detective is the usual suspicious sort. He grills the prof and co-ed about the disappearances of young women, and doesn't buy their tale of monsters. Due to the drab writing and leaden acting, the detective comes across as especially heavy-handed, one-dimensional, and annoying. He seems too dumb to even be a detective in a grade Z horror film.

There are, of course, plenty of things that defy logic. How is it that the blond co-ed is suddenly so handy with a shotgun? And why do she and the prof decide they must dive into the sewer to escape the alien-possessed co-eds, when they're well-armed and can continue blasting the co-eds with their guns?

But one does not watch DEADLY INSTINCTS for logic. It's for the scares and nekkid women. The scares are slight, due to the film's leaden script and pace, though there is gore. But the women are sexy. And the ladies in the audience might appreciate the hunky prof. This films deserves a star and a half, because it's dull much of the time. But I'll curve it up to a two.",1401753600,8,4790,5.835479256080115

644530,3,6303447724,"This film also goes by the title ""Deadly Instincts"". An alien monster and his semi-reluctant human female companion (Kadamba Simmons) crash land in what appears to be a meteor. The alien and girl inhabit the depths of an all-girl school, which is an important plot point as the alien is looking for breeding material.

The art teacher (Todd Jensen) is having an affair with a student (Samantha Womack). Jack (Richard Harrington), the young janitor also has an eye for the girls.

While this is not the best alien creature/young girl film out there, it is not the worse. The creature itself wasn't half bad for a low budget film. The script and dialogue was passable.

644532,2,6303447724,"Sex crazed alien bent on mating with Boston college students...now does that sound like a great B movie or what? Yeah that's what we had suspected as well. However not quite what we were hoping for, but we'll get to that later. First we must make Skylord happy and start from the beginning. Our appeal with Breeders started with the fantastically B cover. You have a jacked up alien spewing out protein revolution mist all over the place just waiting to get his freak on. Once the creature won us over we had to pull the trigger after we read this was an A-Pix production. Yes the same A-Pix to bring on such 90's B horror as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jack-Frost/dp/B00008AOVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jack Frost</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Uncle-Sam/dp/B00026PA7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Uncle Sam</a>. So out of our love for 90's B we really had a civil duty to forge ahead or we may have never forgiven ourselves.

Breeders starts out with some true D grade special effects showing what appears to be a meteorite crashing down upon earth. After seeing the B-ness of the space scene we were getting our hopes up high. As the meteorite reigns down blows upon earth it explodes on a Boston college campus. Once free the alien creatures only mission is to mate with females to keep his species thriving. Honestly the story makes zero sense but we trust you'll stay with us. Hey at least the creature didn't land at a retirement home. He wisely chose a college campus for some grade A top choice meat, younger and hotter...have to give him a thumbs up for that. The issue here was a clear lack of story and an even less prevalent creature. You only get to see it like 5 times which was a let down. Other then that you did have the main actor lady who had a phenomenal booty, that bumped it up to the 2 star rating.

Now we have seen plenty of horrible movies, usually aided by Al Green, and have given them really top notch ratings. It's hard to describe the Sid rating system, because the variables are so in depth that the typical mind simply cannot comprehend it. When we looked at Breeders and broke down all our important key factors there was just too much left out. In the films defense the creature was pretty decent and would have ranked higher due to more of an appearance. However it just didn't deliver enough to make it all that memorable. That's the downside to A-Pix movies. When they did exist, they spent all their $76 budget on the film cover making you go ""ahhhhh sweeet."" So just keep your guard up when it comes to covers that are flashy, making a scene, a flaunting convention.",1306022400,,2711,4.904139433551198
644533,3,6303447724,"A Boston college is the site of a spectacular meteor crash.  For some reason the college head (she calls herself the principal) can only think of the cost of repairs.  No one seems to understand the significance, scientific opportunity, or financial gain the meteorite could bring.  The university staff consists of the principal, and art professor and a janitor.  The art professor has a huge, multi-level apartment in one of the college buildings.
The meteor has brought a woman and a monster.  The monster haunts some underground tunnels while the woman runs around.  Eventually all of the girls on campus wind up wearing necklaces made from the meteorite.  This makes them targets for the monster which wants to use them to further its species.  The monster is violent but supposedly intelligent enough to pull off UFO abductions (year, right!).
Eventually the police are brought in as cannon fodder (aren't they always?) and the principal and art professor must face the monster and try to stop it.
The creature effects in this film are very well done and probably used the script budget as well as the effects budget.  It is a pity to see a monster so well done and have the rest of the film so stupid.  But this is one of those films that is so bad you just have to watch it.",1080518400,5,1282,4.657777777777778
7846740,4,6303447724,"A different kind of movie and slightly reminiscent of ""Humanoids of the Deep"" by Roger Corman The humanoid alien monsters feel the need to breed with human females so they naturally kidnap and rape them. Nothing is really graphic. The interesting twist is the woman must be able to reproduce and be virgins. I guess the monsters have a special sense about that so they know which females to select. The movie would be rated for teens and older. I don't think I would allow a grade school or younger child to view it. They may be frightened and confused. This is the second version of this movie.
