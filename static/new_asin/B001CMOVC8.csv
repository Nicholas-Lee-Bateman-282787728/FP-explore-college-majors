8288205,5,B001CMOVC8,"Finally broke down and started buying the series. Have watched on and off over the years and always enjoyed the show. Now that I can watch them in order (some 3-4 at a sitting) I can see more of the story line that I was missing. I never realized Crabman had such a mysterious past. I don't understand if he was relocated with a new identity how he could be growing pot in his grandmothers house on the ""COPS"" episode. I won't lose sleep over this as it was one of the funniest episodes.

I guess I could make a case of the moral to the story as I do beleive that when you do good it will come back around but hey, just watch it cause it is funny. I will be buying the rest of the series. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do cause we all need a little laugh once in awhile.

A small shout-out for Amazon and Mediablasters (seller) who made this purchase flawless.",1257897600,,863,4.011627906976744
8288206,5,B001CMOVC8,"I can't remember the last time I got a real belly laugh watching a TV show. Maybe back in the early Simpson years. So many of the characters on this show remind me of people I grew up with in North Carolina (yes, I know it's sad). The COPS episodes were especially funny. I am one of the first to complain about the lack of well-written entertainment to come out of Hollywood recently but Earl is the exception.",1237766400,4,411,4.282051282051282
