This SongXpress release is a good tape for beginners looking to push themselves a little harder. While none of the tunes here should be insurmountably hard for beginners to learn, they are also not three chord tunes that can be learned in a minute. The gentle ""If"" is a great example of a song that isn't TOO difficult to play, yet sounds as if it is quite tough, and should provide guitarists with a song that they can use to thoroughly impress all their friends. Instructor Tommy Anthony thankfully deals a little more with right hand strumming patterns in Soft Rock Vol. 1 than he does in most other videos in the series.

THIS IS NOT MY REVIEW, however, the first review complained about not knowing the listing - which I agree with, but come on folks, this is the internet, one second on Google lets me know what this is.",1246147200,,957,4.570588235294117
