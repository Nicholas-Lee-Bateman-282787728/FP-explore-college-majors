2889837,5,B000SSONRK,This was a really fun movie. I rented it for my son because he just read the book for school. He was very entertained by it. He found it funny as well as easily spoofed. He quoted some of the movie lines. It probably wouldn't be my taste but my 17 year old loved it.,1412985600,,266,3.8545454545454545

2889842,4,B000SSONRK,"This movie is awesome, though not a faithful take on the original story. The atmosphere, great sets and costumes, and great acting make up for the shortfall there. It really needs to be released in hardcopy for those of us whose connections preclude watching it on amazon (due to time limits on the file).",1354492800,4,305,4.666666666666667
2889843,4,B000SSONRK,"I had previously posted a highly negative review of this DVD because twice I had ordered it and twice I had received the wrong DVD (about winter pike fishing) in a package and with a label that identified this particular product content. I have been in correspondence with a representative of the manufacturer and he has gone to great pains to rectify the mistake and he replaced my incorrectly-labeled DVD with the correct one. He has also shared with me assurance that the distribution problem has been rectified  and that copies distributed by Amazon will be the correct content. This representative has been extremely gracious and accommodating. He even phoned me at home from London. A+ for customer relations!  As to the content of the DVD:Now that I've seen it,  I think the material is very useful for providing historical context about the poem's provenance to undergraduates studying this magnificent, but difficult, 14th-century Middle English poem. I am a professor of medieval literature, and I believe this DVD will enhance my undergraduate students' understanding and appreciation of the poem. I would like our library to have a copy for students to check out for themselves. I recommend it and particularly liked the segment about misericords, an aspect of church architecture that is difficult to explain without allowing students (who cannot make a trip to England) to see these unique medieval choir seats and their amazing carvings.",1260835200,12,1452,5.1440677966101696
2889844,2,B000SSONRK,"So short it's not worth the cost.  Considering the fascinating historical and literary subject matter, very little was made of it.  Pass on this one and find another source elsewhere.",1260057600,,183,5.066666666666666
2889845,4,B000SSONRK,"I ordered three products through Alibris and one through Amazon.  I received this product in three days, with expedited shipping, I still have not received my other order.  The price might be a little higher, but the service is worth the cost.",1244419200,,243,4.761904761904762
2889846,5,B000SSONRK,"This British documentary on *Sir Gawain and the Green Knight* is a great resource for teachers of British literature and/or history.  It is not a reenactment of the play but a documentary with five parts: ""King Arthur and the English Kings,"" ""The Kingship of Richard II,"" ""The Land of Arthur,"" ""The Green Knight,"" and ""The Death of the Fourteenth Century.""  Bonuses  include a segmented interview with Dr. David Matthews, Lecturer in Middle English, Literature, and Culture at Manchester University, and a piece entitled ""Chester Cathedral and the Misericords.""

The cinematography and music create a haunting mood for the discussion of this anonymous work of literature probably from Cheshire, where the northwestern dialect of Middle English flourished in the fourteenth century.  The narrator puts the work within the context of its time, including background information on the Welsh roots of the Arthurian legend and the way Plantagenet kings co-opted the legend to identify the heroic figures with the ruling Norman kings.  Much is made of Richard II, who made Chester a principality, bringing, it is argued, the decadence of his court to the northwest.

The video and its bonuses address issues such as the plot, theme, symbolism, and language of the poem, explaining the bob-and-wheel, alliteration, the pentangle, and the spiritual dimensions of the poem.  I was interested to see the inclusion of the pagan Green Man as a possible interpretation of the Green Knight.  Not a New Ager myself, I am aware that the Green Man has been dusted off for a ""new"" entry into the twenty-first century, and since he had probably not completely disappeared from the Christian England of the Gawain poet, knowledge of him helps today's student to see a dimension of the poem that may have been unclear to previous generations of readers.

I gave the program a 5-star rating despite the fact that in the bonus interview with Dr. Matthews, the questions which appear on screen contain misspellings that detract from the otherwise high quality of this documentary.  With that caveat, I highly recommend this video for anyone who desires to learn more about medieval English culture.",1243209600,30,2174,5.1477272727272725

I've never seen it since - it seemed to have disappeared without trace, until now I find it on some Amazon option for just viewing or downloading. I do not wish to download it. I want a proper DVD. When will we get one? At this rate most of us will be dead - all the actors too, before it appears?",1433894400,3,433,3.9318181818181817
