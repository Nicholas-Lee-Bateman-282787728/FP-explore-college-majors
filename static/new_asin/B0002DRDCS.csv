2079923,1,B0002DRDCS,"This movie was supposed to capture the historical event to its true sense.  One of the most well advertised aspect of this movie was its accuracy.  It was to show the Mexican side as well as the Texican side.  It meant to show the Santa Anna's army and its journey from Mexico City to San Antonio de Bexar.  It was shot mostly for that notion, but editing and the will of the producers took away any of real historical accuracy.  It was a lob-sided story telling when it was said and done on the wide screen.  Depicting the Mexican army and the process of war was done very poorly in development of the Mexican characters and the focus on the Texican side was developed incorrectly.  This movie lacks fluid story telling, if one pays a close attention, at times it leaves you wondering how the parts are coming together.  The movie shows the illness of Jim Bowie as its center piece, and General Sam Houston as a drunken leader.  The action and the war part of the movie  as well as characters was developed poorly thus rendering it an escape from a fun entertaining history telling.  The budget was way over shot by John Lee H., it came close to what Ron Howard proposed for his R rating movie.  There was no comparison of proposed cast of both directors.  There could have been at least three Oscar winners involved with the movie.  John Lee wanted an historically accurate movie, but his vision took a detour; he had to comply to the will of the producers as well as poor judgment.  John Lee's vision ended up twisted.  I am writing this review since I was on the set from Feb until May.  I saw the parts shot which would have made a some what compelling story but they were left on the editing table.  Audience response made this movie one of the biggest disappointments for Disney.  History telling was at one of it's lowest points.",1088726400,21,1837,4.446107784431137
2079924,4,B0002DRDCS,"Alamo DVD is an excellent collection of old and new Alamo movies and documentaries.  If you're an Alamo fan, I recommend getting this 3-pack rather than just buying the three DVD's separately.  The Alamo Documentary discusses everything from the Alamo's history to its pop culture significance to the Alamo in the movies over the years.  There are countless interviews with Alamo historians and buffs which make it all very interesting.  ""Martyrs of The Alamo"" is D.W. Griffith's take on the birth of Texas.  If you can get past the completely racist depictions of Mexicans, this is an entertaining movie with surprisingly good battle scenes for 1915.  In Martyrs, the Texas War of Independence is started because a Mexican officer flirts with Susannah Dickinson.  ""Heroes of the Alamo"" is a B-western that tells the courageous story of the Alamo defenders from the Dickinson's perspective.  Alamo fans will love seeing these early depictions of the Alamo while also learning some new facts about the myths involved with the famous mission in San Antonio.
  The 3-pack DVD offers a ton of worthwhile extras that are not available anywhere else.  The Alamo documentary DVD includes an hour long documentary, a trailer from John Wayne's The Alamo, Remember The Alamo(an educational film made from a cut down Heroes of the Alamo) and a brief interview with Alamo buff Joe Musso.  The Martyrs of the Alamo DVD includes D.W. Griffith's movie, ""The Alamo, Shrine of Texas Liberty(a very low budget movie made at Mission San Jose in San Antonio), and a five-minute cartoon.  The Heroes of the Alamo DVD includes the movie, and the remaining footage from Davy Crockett At The Fall of The Alamo, a silent film starring Cullen Landis.  Because of their age, the movies are not in the best of condition, but they are worth watching.  For a great collection of Alamo movies, check out this very entertaining collection from Frank Thompson!",1088121600,2,1927,4.996865203761756
2079925,4,B0002DRDCS,"Let me start this revie by saying the movie is only as historically accurate as the historian you choose to believe. I found this version to be a lot more truthful than any other Alamo movie. The Texan troops were not the heroic, freedom at any cost, soldiers we were led to believe in the history books. They were people with alterior motives, who were caught in the middle of a giant pickle with no help. The Mexican soldiers were not dark and faceless, as the John Wayne version tried to portray. They did not go into great detail with the common soldier, but they at least hinted at them as being human beings.
The big three at the Alamo were not the great heroic leaders, who were there because of freedom. They were there because of their own agenda. Travis escaped a life of marriage and debt from Mississippi, to become a man of importance in Texas. He did not come to fight for freedom. Bowie was one a criminal in the first degree. Forging documents, due to a loop-hole in the Louisiana Purchase documents, which would have made him one of the richest landowners in the U.S. When he was discovered, he came to Texas. Crockett was voted out of Congress from the state of Tennessee, even though he was extremely popular (he lost because he fell out of favor with President Andrew Jackson. He came for a new political life, not to fight the Mexican troops for freedom.
Sure there is a lot of Hollywood drama, but I beleive the details of the siege and battle are far more accurate than anything previous. Even the capture and execution of Davy Crockett has been debated heavily, there is still at least written documentation of that event actually happening. Otherwise,it is all speculation and here-say, but I do not think Crockett said those things to Santa Ana before he died.
The only real problem I had with the movie, is Santa Ana is way too old. The guy died in 1876, and the Alamo was in 1836. Santa Ana lived into his 70's(I beleive,it could have been 80's) So that would put him in his 30's or 40's at the time of the battle. The actor looked like he was in his late 60's. I thought he did a good job, but he did not look the part. I thought Thornton was superb as Crockett, even though he is kind of a nut.",1088121600,5,2224,4.374396135265701
2079926,4,B0002DRDCS,"The first disk, a documentary, explores the history and pop culture of the Alamo: it explores how the Alamo became a cultural icon, and tours Alamo collections (including some rare John Wayne memorabilia!). There is also a re-enactment battle scene, which I found rather interesting as I may not ever get a chance to see it in person.
Also included in this set is the D.W. Griffith film ""Martyrs of the Alamo"" (1915, known for being racially slanted) and ""Heroes of the Alamo,"" (1937) both pretty good prints considering their age!
There are also some special extras like a few shorts about the Alamo, which I found interesting, as well as the original movie trailer for John Wayne's ""The Alamo.""  Worth the watch!!",1082419200,4,715,4.813008130081301
2079927,3,B0002DRDCS,"I thank Delta and Frank Thompson for releasing this 3-disc set.  These early films have helped to fill the gap in Alamo cultural history, and every Alamo film buff should have this set.  The silent ""Martyrs of the Alamo"" is in fairly good shape, considering it comes from 1914.  Thompson indicates that the other movie, ""Heroes of the Alamo"", looks like a B-western.  I think he being too kind - it looks more like a D-western to me, with some of the worst ""acting"" I have ever encountered. The extras on these discs make for nice fillers.
Now, if only ""The Last Command"" (from the 1950's) would make its DVD debut, all would be right with the world.  And, while they're at it, how about releasing the IMAX film, ""Alamo - The Price of Freedom"" on DVD.  Other IMAX films have made it to the new medium, so how about this one.
I have less enthusiasum for the documentary on the first disc, which comes across as less professional, and looks like it was put together on a shoestring budget.  I was hoping for more history of the cultural impact the Alamo has played on our lives, and not just browsing through a fans collection of posters and costumes.  Some historians make an appearance here and there, but I was hoping for a video version of Frank Thompson's indispensable book, ""The Alamo - a Cultural History"".  Well, I guess we can't have everything.",1082246400,8,1353,4.534979423868313

2079932,5,B0002DRDCS,"This version of the 13 day siege of the Alamo in 1836 is more believable with still bigger than life characters. The individuals interacted bettered and you could feel that they were real; the actors did not outshine the characters they portray. The surprise was the superb acting of Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett.

This film shows that there are good sides to people and bad sides to people; even heroes have their problems. It was interesting on how the blacks had to choose sides or the lack of sides. You can see this again in the film dated ""Gunga Din"" (1939) where Gunga Din (Sam Jaffee), native Indian, had to choose sides in the conflict with the British.

I have been to San Antonio and the film nails the feel of the area. The area has not changed that much.

The music is brilliant, and the battle scenes are the most realistic of 19th century combat I have ever watched. I visited the Alamo about a year after watching this movie, and I enjoyed it greatly. John Wayne's may be more famous, but I could not stand it. I am a history nut and I want things to be accurate, and this movie is very historically accurate when it deals with the Alamo, while Wayne's does not feel real, rather it feels like a cartoon or a fictional story. I particularly enjoyed this movie showing the Mexican point of view, something that is often forgotten about when it comes to the Alamo.

I would love to see a series that begins with events leading up to the Gonzales incident on through statehood and the Mexican-Americam War.  It would need to be a series, because a single movie could not cover everything.

2079967,5,B0002DRDCS,"while I loved this movie I have to point out some real discrepancies in this movie and in some of the other supposedly historical beliefs.  General Houston actually sent an order to colonel Travis to abandon the Alamo because he believed and rightly so that it was indefensible and Travis being the aristocratic conceded person he was refused. this movie shows the Alamo falling before Goliad and that is just the opposite of what happened, Colonel Fannin surrendered Goliad before the Alamo fell and his men were marched out on the premise of gathering wood and as soon as they were out of hearing Colonel Jose Portilla under orders from Santa Anna executed Fannin and his officers and then the Mexican soldiers on the wood detail shot and bayonetted Fannin's men. this movie as with all movies based on fact takes liberties as was also the case with Jim Bowie, he was married to I believe a relative of Santa Anna and Santa Anna was distressed when he first heard that Bowie was in the Alamo. in this movie Almaron Dickinson was a Lieutenant when in reality he was a Captain. just a few people survived the battle and one was Jim Bowie's slave and another was Susanna Dickinson and her baby daughter and they went to the camp where Sam Houston was and gave their version of what happened and the slave's story we now know coincides with the Mexican Officer Enrique De la Pena's story that Crockett and at least 13 others surrendered and were later lined against a wall and shot and bayonetted then Santa Anna ordered all the bodies piled up and burned, however no one believed the slave but instead believed Susanna Dickinson's version that every one died fighting but later Pena's story came out that coincides with the slaves. Susanna Dickinson and her daughter lived out the rest of their lives in obscurity as Prostitutes. the rest of the movie as far as I can tell was fairly accurate, and it was entertaining and for the most part accurate!",1476057600,2,1948,4.646376811594203

2079977,3,B0002DRDCS,"Released in 2004 and directed by John Lee Hancock, The Alamo is a Western about the 1836 siege and fall of the famous Spanish mission-turned-fortress by Santa Annas army of a couple thousand disciplined troops. The Alamo is defended by a ragtag assortment of roughly 200 soldiers, militia men and volunteers, including the famous frontiersman & politician Davy Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton), loose cannon Jim Bowie (Jason Patric) and by-the-book militarist Colonel William Travis (Patrick Wilson), the latter two regularly butting heads. Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) is on hand as a significant peripheral character.

The more popular John Wayne version from 1960 is just all-around more entertaining than this generally dreary rendition, although this version certainly earns points for being more realistic plus giving Santa Anna considerable screen time (excellently played by Emilio Echevarra), the latter of which the Wayne version doesnt do at all. Not to mention, this version ends with the humiliating defeat of Santa Anna & his army in a mere 18 minutes just six weeks after the fall of the Alamo. The rallying cry of Sam Houston & the Texian Army was naturally Remember the Alamo! You could say that Wayne filmed the Spirit of the Alamo with everything that goes with it, like big historical speeches, while the newer film goes for a more realistic telling, including de-mythifying the various legends. When it comes to historical accuracy, this version is about as close as any Hollywood movie gets.

But keep this in mind: No movie has ever been made, or will ever be made, about the Alamo that's thoroughly accurate, except for the obvious gist of things. Why? Because ALL of the defenders were killed. Even the Mexican eyewitnesses who were there disagreed on the major events that took place. For example, there are those who claim Davy Crockett was killed in the assault, as shown in Waynes version, while others say he survived the battle along with 5-6 others only to be captured, lined up, and executed, as essentially depicted in this film. So any movie you see about the Alamo is going to contain a lot of conjecture.

Dimitri Tiomkin's score in Waynes version is a dramatic, thrilling and tragic multifaceted piece that captured the slow build-up, eventual battle and aftermath. Carter Burwells score in this version is mediocre by comparison; while certainly adept and adequate, its essentially a funeral dirge that puts a dreary overcast over the proceedings.

BOTTOM LINE: Ive seen this version of The Alamo twice and have mixed feeling about it. I prefer the more modern, realistic tone of this version to Waynes rendition, as well as the time devoted to Santa Anna & his men, not to mention the inclusion of the Battle of San Jacinto. On top of this, the movies spiced with numerous good-to-great bits, but  overall  it just comes across too flat and dull. Something needed to perk it up out of the cinematic doldrums. The depiction of the Battle of San Jacinto does this, of course, but its the last 12 minutes of the film and too little too late. Perhaps too many cooks spoiled the broth.

The movie runs 134 minutes and was shot in near Wimberly, Texas, forty miles north of San Antonio

2080013,5,B0002DRDCS,"I, like many Americans, hold a very near and dear place in my heart for the battle of the Alamo. Though the actual reasons for the battle and the Texas insurrection are numerous and extremely debatable to many, the idea of roughly 200 men essentially selling their lives dearly for their perceived individual freedoms is intoxicating and addicting. Though I know the deification of controversial men like Crockett, Travis and Bowie can be viewed as hypocritical by many historians (each man had personal baggage that causes contention), there is just something that attracts Americans to the idea of offering the ultimate sacrifice for liberty, freedom and the right to make your own way.

Many previous films of the Alamo have tried (and often failed) to mix Hollywood entertainment with some semblance of historical facts. Some caused hysteria for coonskin caps and buckskins, while others portrayed the heroes as too aged and too unrelatable for many fans of the battle. John Lee Hancock's version of ""The Alamo"" is simply the absolute best version of the film to date. The battle is covered in its entirety (it was a battle at night that lasted about 90 minutes) offering as historically accurate as possible a recreation of the fateful event. The film ventures even as far as depicting how tired and weary the defenders were, exhausted by sleep deprivation and constant Mexican shelling,  when it came time to actually do battle with a seemingly more rested and battle-ready Mexican army. The most interesting points of the movie to me were the controversial (yet now widely accepted version) of Travis death, the human element that it goes out of its way to provide for Crockett, and the ultimate end for one of my favorite American heroes: David Crockett.

The film is wonderfully shot and well written by all involved, and the job that they did with casting is simply brilliant. Many have already stated it, but Billy Bob Thornton as David Crockett steals the movie and should have stolen an Oscar for the performance. The realness and intimate nature that Thornton provides made me see a side of Crockett that I didn't believe Id ever really want to see from a personal hero. You no longer have doubts about Davy going down swingin ole Betsy, instead, you feel sympathy and a closeness to a man that seemed trapped by his own self-serving ego (this in no way is an insult to Crockett). Jason Patrick is well suited to play Bowie with his veteran presence and style, and Patrick Wilson is another highlight with his portrayal of William Barret Travis. Wilson does a masterful job of portraying Travis as a newly rejuvenated and remade Texas man that shouldered an immense burden of desperately needing to feel respected and a large desire to become famous. Others like Dennis Quaid as Sam Houston, Emilio Echevarr&iacute;a as Antonio L&oacute;pez de Santa Anna and Kevin Page as Micajah Autry do more than add to an already known story, they add the dynamic of seasoned actors putting a much needed breath of life into a well-loved and respected story.

The movie is simply a masterpiece to fans of the Alamo and Texas rebellion of 1835-1836. Everybody undertakes their roles with vigor and enthusiasm that ignites the movie from the outset, and the intricacies of story and direction that Hancock uses while directing make this movie the quintessential Alamo film, and also one of my absolute favorites of all time.",1438560000,2,3424,4.90846286701209

If this bit of history interests you, this is the version to see.",1435363200,,350,4.596774193548387
2080027,5,B0002DRDCS,"I have long since lost count of the number of versions and in fact number of times i've watched the story on screen.
i guess it all started for me when i was a child, 'Disney' not only made a film about 'Davy Crockett' ( starring 'Fess Parker' ) they also ran a serial of the story in their weekly comic i had bought for me at the time.
Since when i've always had had a fascination with historic tales of unselfish valour such as 'the Alamo' and indeed 'Zulu'
I believe in this version of the heroic 'last stand' at the 'Alamo' both the film makers and the lead cast made every effort to make it as authentic as it possibly can be.
The defenders of the 'Alamo must of made the 'Mexican's' regret the siege, by actually making the on-coming army pay dearly for every life they took.
Less than 200 most of which were volunteers stood tall against overwhelming odds for thirteen days from Febuary 23rd - March 6th 1836.
The battle did indeed occur before sunrise as this version depicts, 'William Travis' became one of the early victims among the defenders, again as portrayed.
'Jim Bowie' suffering from a debilitating chest related illness may well have died before the 'Mexican's' reached him, there is no record of how 'Davy Crockett' met his maker, he could well have been one of the few that survived the battle only to be executed on site by the Mexican's soon after the Two Hour siege was complete.
Historians differ over the numbers the defenders took in reply, some say around 400 to 600 legend suggesting two to three times that number, we'll never know for sure I guess.
The story has generated much in the way of myth and legend down the years, one thing however ,certain, the men that
stood tall at the walls of the 'Alamo' will never be forgotten.
I also felt that also including 'Sam Houston's' victory over 'Santa Anna' a significant addition to proceedings, not shown in earlier 'Alamo' films, of course it was a significant event after the fall of the 'Alamo' and surrender of 'Fannin's' force and their subsequent slaughter at the hands of the Mexican Army at 'Goliad'
Many of us have seen other versions, but...i do believe this is probably closer to how events took place than many of the previous offerings, though like myself many will have loved 'John Wayne's' swashbuckling version.
'Billy Bob Thornton's' portrayal of the legendary 'Davy Crockett' is far and away the best I've seen, he owned the screen, there of course have been many portrayals down the years, among the other convincing and note worthy portrayals in the film
'Jason Patric' (James Bowie) 'Dennis Quaid' (Sam Houstan) and 'Patrick Wilson' (William Travis)
The heroics at the 'Alamo' have always been of interest to me, i have watched this version several times since on the DVD format
I recently fulfilled a life-time ambition to visit 'The Alamo' a humbling experience indeed, sadly one is not permitted to take photographs inside the Chapel, or indeed touch the wall, preservation of paramount importance to the trustee's.
Because of seeing 'Col J Bonham' listed among the commanders on the plaque inside the chapel, and having noticed one of the
four statues in front of the 'Alamo' to be that of 'Bonham' i was a little confused, i therefore approached one of the curators, who
was gracious enough to engage in an in-depth conversation with me, it seems that a mistake had been made by the sites restoration team by listing J.Bonham as one of the commanders and indeed including him alongside 'Crockett''Travis' and 'Bowie'
when preparing the site for visitors many years ago.
'Bonham' was actually one of the couriers sent out by 'Travis' to get help, it is believed that 'Col J Bonham' did return to the 'Alamo'
with the message that no help was coming, and indeed died alongside the defenders, which of course makes him one of the notable
Heroes.
There is no entrance fee, the trustee's rely solely on sales from the site's shop to maintain the site, and pay it's staff.
If you haven't seen this version and enjoy 'Historical' events such as this, I can certainly recommend viewing the film, it's available
at a very good price at present (would love to see this upgraded to Blu-ray)
There is also a great many Special-Features on-board the disc to enjoy.

I loved his Davy,  who tries to live up to his King of the Wild Frontier image that everyone expects of him, and yet you sense his hatred for killing.  Emilio Echevarria is loathsome as Santa Ana so it is fun to see him get his comeuppance.  And Dennis Quaid is rousing as Sam Houston.

2080098,5,B0002DRDCS,"I was a guest at the Alamo movie set in Dripping Springs Texas. I drove there from Florida - all because of seeing this film... I've seen most of the films on the Alamo. This one is in a class by itself. It is exacting historical fiction - from the statues on the front of the Alamo chapel to the DIckensonian costumes of the characters. For those who want action and left field drama - John Wayne's film does that better than any. If you're looking for a fictional, titanic climax, The Alamo 2004, is not your film. If you want some solid historical context, this film is about as historical as one could get without making it a DRT documentary. Billy Bob Thornton bears a striking resemblance to David Crockett and plays the part, as one reviewer observed, ""as if he was channeling Crockett."" Billy Bob also characterized the Alamo film best. ""The Alamo is about waiting, not fighting."" There is plenty of tension and anguish to go around. Patrick Wilson plays impassioned commander William B. Travis with heart and indomitable will - even in the face of impending disaster. Jason Patric is so sanguine a Jim Bowie, his air of menace is never eclipsed by the ominous shadow of death. Preview audiences were responsible for the film's length and detail being cut down (""too historical..."") This may be why a film Roger Ebert extravagantly praised - died at the box office.

2080103,4,B0002DRDCS,"This movie is a reasonably faithful porrtayal of the momentous events that occurred in San Antonio in 1836.  The cast, led by Dennis Quaid does a reasonable job.  But what really happened at the Alamo so many years ago and why is it worth remembering today?

1836 was the momentous year in the history of Texas, Mexico and the United States.  In that year a small group of Texians and Tejanos gathered at a fortified church in San Antonio called the Alamo.  This was the year of the Texas Revolution.

The mission of the Alamo had been built by the Spanish in 1744.  It was intended to help settle a desolate sparsely populated land and to convert native Americans, mainly Comanches, to Christianity.

In 1821 Mexico won its independence from Spain.  Texas was still a desolate land with few settlers.  The Mexicans launched a campaign to bring more people to Texas by offering generous land grants.  The only catch was that new settlers had to convert to Catholicism and that slavery was illegal.  This brought many Americans, mostly from the Southern states, to Texas.  Stephen Austin was and American Impresario in the Texas territory who actually changed his first name to ""Estaban"".  Austin today is politically the ""bluest"" part of Texas.

Then the government in Mexico changed.  The dictator Santa Anna came to power.  Suddenly the Anglo immigrants seemed to be a threat to Mexican rule.

The occupation of the Alamo by about 250 Texians was a direct threat to Mexican authority.  From the Mexican perspective, the Alamo insurgency was the result of a failed immigration policy that needed to be revised and the rebellion put down.  Santa Anna arrived with a force of over 2,000 Mexican soldiers to subdue the mission.

The leaders of the Texas Revolution who became the martyrs at the Alamo had no desire for martyrdom.  Most had come to Texas to get rich.  They were not perfect people.  Many were slaveowners.  There were classic American stories of men who had come to Texas looking for life's ""second chance"".

Jim Bowie, born in Kentucky, was a forger and a land swindler who was wanted in several U.S. states.  He had also invented the Bowie knife.  Bowie was ill (either pneumonia or tuberculosis) and bed-ridden for most of the Alamo siege.

In 1831 William Travis was an Alabama school teacher who abandoned his pregnant wife and child to make his way to Texas.  At age 26 the Alamo was his first command.  Travis brought his slave Joe to the Alamo.

David Crockett was a legendary frontiersman from Tennessee.  He was elected to Congress in 1826, but lost his re-election bid in 1834.  Crockett responded, ""I told the people of my district that I would serve them as faithfully as I had done; but if not, they might go to hell, and I would go to Texas.""

The siege of the Alamo lasted 13 days.  Travis wrote a famous letter begging for assistance...

Early in the hours of March 6 the final assault on the Alamo was launched.  This was a clever tactic on the Mexican side which allowed them to reach the outer walls with minimal casualties.  The bravery of the assaulting Mexican forces is indisputable.  Travis was one the the first defenders to be killed that night.  His slave Joe survived the battle.

Travis' defiant ""Victory or Death"" defence of the Alamo recalls Leonidas' defence of Thermopylae against the Persians.  ""Come and take it"" would  become a motto for Texans just as it had been for Leonidas.

Mexican forces had won a victory at the Alamo.  Due to the savage no quarter policy ordered by Santa Anna, it would prove to be a Pyrrhic victory for the Mexicans.  After the Alamo, Santa Anna also ordered the murder of over 342 unarmed Texian prisoners at Goliad.  Santa Anna's disregard of the rules of warfare exposed to the world his nature as a brutal tyrannical dictator; by these actions Mexico had forfeited its legitimate claim to Texas.

""Remember the Alamo"" would become a rallying cry for Sam Houston's force of Texians at the decisive Battle of San Jacinto which took place the following month.

Visitors to the Alamo who are familiar with the John Wayne movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Alamo/dp/B0048HQIKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Alamo</a>&nbsp;may be astonished to learn that the remains of the Alamo Mission are right in the heart of the city of San Antonio.  It is particularly moving to see the Alamo at night when it vibrates an almost mystical aura.

2080138,3,B0002DRDCS,"I like the film, but it seems that it is another Hollywood version of the story.  Also, I questioned some of the historical accuracy  of the characters and events.  For example, the actor who played Santa Anna seems to old for the character.  It seems that the real Santa Anna was younger  than he was portrayed in the movie, in 1836.  Also, if anyone can read the book, ""Exodus from the Alamo"" (2011) by Phillip Tucker, it helps to state that many of the Mexican soldiers were killed or injured by friendly fire than the defenders weapons.

Nevertheless, it is a nice Hollywood version of the story.",1408838400,,600,4.5514018691588785

Everything about the movie is really good--the acting, the direction, the cinematography, the location and the special features put it over the top. Not only a great movie but, also, a real look into the  history of the battle and the main players in this history on both sides. This is highly recommended--especially for those interested in learning more about history.
I will also recommend the movie, Gettysburg. Great, great movie (brilliant acting job by Jeff Daniels) but, also, an amazing look into the history of that battle (super special features). Recommended.",1406246400,,740,4.736434108527132
2080152,4,B0002DRDCS,Everyone else seems to hate this movie; I liked it.  I thought Davey Crockett and Jim Bowie characters were more complex than you usually get.  The story line is also better connected to the history of the Alamo and the broader conflict around it than in most movies.  The acting and directing are great. The penultimate scene of Billy Bob Thornton as Davey Crockett offering to accept the surrender of the Mexican Army after his own capture is great.

2080157,5,B0002DRDCS,"The Alamo has been put on the silver screen many times in many ways.  For the Baby Boomer generation it is John Wayne's spin that is very likely burned in their mind.

This movie came out later-2003.  It is updated to reflect the audience-mood during the tumultuous time of the early Bush II years.  Yes, movies reflecting historical events are updated or changed to meld with the times contemporaneous to the release.  This movie is meticulous in portraying accurate period costumes and technology.  Unlike so many westerns, there aren't lever action Henry Rifles telescoped back to a time when flintlocks were the only weapon.

The movie also explores the cultural and racial clash between the Anglos and the Mexicans.  It is clearly the clash of civilizations.  Additionally, the movie follows the likely course of the battle that includes the pre-dawn attack and the small size of the forces.  The characters are also portrayed as flesh and blood men, Bowie, Crockett, Travis, and Santa Ana are as human as you imagine them to be.",1401840000,7,1034,4.92485549132948

2080176,5,B0002DRDCS,"At first glance, I was concerned.  The first few scenes came across as just another attempt to tarnish our American heritage.  I was prepared to hate the movie.  But it was a setup.  After showing some of the character flaws of Travis (and others), and questioning whether Crockett lived up to the hype surrounding his accomplishments, the movie balances heroism against human frailty in a way that the other biographies miss.  The characters live up to the legends.  We will never know exactly what transpired within those walls after the siege began, lacking surviving witnesses (other than some of the noncombatants).  However, the movie fills the small details in a very plausible way within the framework of what we do know.  I loved the music and the acting.

2080178,3,B0002DRDCS,The movie was okay. It seemed to run a little more towards what actually took place but I guess the actual events wouldn't make for a good movie. Dennis Quaid's part wasn't very good in my opinion. Overall a pretty good movie.,1395187200,,226,4.404761904761905

I wanted my daughter to understand we lost legends that day and to see how important it is to take a stand. She loved the movie too- wanted to watch it again.

The character development of the mains was just enough as we found out a little about the personal lives of each (Travis, Bowie, Houston and Crockett) and each of these people were represented well by the actors that portrayed them.  We also get a look into the character of Santa Anna and his quest to be the Napoleon of the West. The battle scenes were extremely well done, and I feel this was a much more historically accurate telling of this battle for Texas freedom.  Not only depicting the fall of the Alamo, but Houston's final conquest of Santa Anna and obtaining the rights of Texas is also included.  I encourage people to view this movie and make up their own minds, but I definitely recommend this film.

I found this version to be more historically accurate, based on several books I've read about this event and the following victory at San Jacinto.  Incidentally, I was born and raised in Texas, so Texas History was a must in school.
This movie, though a bit Hollywood-ish, was still quite accurate as to the events leading up to the fall of the mission.  Whether or not Crockett and several others were captured, tortured then put to death is still speculated, but many say he was among many who were captured then killed.  What they don't show is the Mexican Army burning the bodies of the defenders in several large funeral pyres.  Overall, the best so far.",1385942400,3,777,4.642335766423358

2080204,3,B0002DRDCS,"To be sure, there is some attention to historical detail in this screen version of the story of the siege of the Alamo. The costuming is largely impeccable, the layout is generally if not completely accurate, and the iconic humpback facade of the current-day Alamo is missing, as it was in 1836. I must confess, however, that I find this film's story rather limp and shapeless. The character of Bowie is strangely distant and uninteresting, while Travis is rather boringly monochromatic. Billy Bob Thorton's David Crockett, on the other hand, breathes what life there is into this movie, and it's a shame we couldn't see more of the story through his eyes. Dennis Quaid, meanwhile, is on occasion unintentionally a hoot as Sam Houston, particularly at the end -- if you close your eyes and listen to his speech on horseback just prior to the climactic battle that cinched independence for Texas, you can imagine it's really Will Ferrell as anchorman Ron Burgundy shouting encouragement to the troops. (""You stay classy, San Jacinto!"") Nice to look at and interesting when Crockett is on screen, the film nonetheless devolves into a solemn, self-important bore.",1383868800,,1160,5.015544041450777

Fortunately, this is not the truth.  I find it to be a superb film with rich and accurate subtext.  Whereas Duke's movie used and abused Alamo historians, Hancock's hired the best and paid attention.  The story is succinct and thorough, and the characters are well-defined and come with rich subtext and subtle backstory.  Rewatching it continues to reveal greater depth, and for afficianados of the battle, there is no more powerful or accurate real-feel -- and this is with PG-13 treatment!  It must be viewed widescreen to fully appreciate Dean Semler's splendid photography and Michael Corenblith's mind-blowing sets, as well as to get the full force of Hancock's cinematic treatment.

2080220,5,B0002DRDCS,"By now, anyone reading this has read all the negative reviews by all the ""smart"" people.  Forget all of that #%$&!, clear your mind of all expectations, and just watch the movie.  I found the story fascinating, and very well-told by this movie.  After watching it, I immediately read several extensive volumes and watched a number of documentaries about the Texas Revolution, the Alamo, and the key players whose lives ended there.

Having never met David Crockett, William Travis, nor Sam Bowie in person, I can't know what they were like, but the on-screen depictions of these men seemed very much in line with the accounts I have read.  Yes, the movie did take some liberties with the chronology of events, but that is commonly done in movies in order to develop the characters more completely.  This movie helps us understand who these men were who fought this battle and what they must have gone through in the 2 weeks leading up to their deaths.  Stories like this are never about the events as much as the people who shaped them.  This movie did an excellent job of depicting these men as real flesh-and-blood people, without diminishing their status as authentic heroes.

Most of the negative reviews seem to be from people with political axes to grind, mostly on the left but some on the right, too.  Some ""smart"" people complain about this movie because they believe it showed the Alamo defenders as larger-than-life heroes, instead of the ignorant, racist, opportunistic thieves that the ""smart"" people know them to be.  These people have never read the history.  Others complain because they believe the movie unfairly depicted the Alamo defenders as ignorant, racist, opportunistic thieves.

Historical figures are real people who did extraordinary deeds.  They are not the hideous nor the flawless caricatures that some people want them to be.  The defenders of the Alamo were real people, and the movie did an excellent job of helping us see them as such.

After watching the movie a couple of times, watch it again as one of the project historians gives a scene-by-scene commentary.  It is also excellent.",1372291200,2,2121,4.912921348314606
2080221,5,B0002DRDCS,"I am a third generation Texan. The Alamo is special to me, since I went to school in San Antonio, and spent a lot of time visiting the shrine. My personal hero is Juan Seguin. He cast his fate with the Texans, even though he was a Mexican citizen. History has forgotten that there were Mexicans fighting in the Alamo against Santa Anna. Juan Seguin returned to the Alamo as he promised he would and helped give a proper burial to its defenders. The John Wayne version mentioned Juan Seguin, but never explained his contribution to the fight at the Alamo.
Jim Bowie was a Mexican citizen and was married. His wife and child died in a cholera epidemic.
As for how Crockett was killed, it doesn't really matter to me personally. He choose to stay. The question I always ask myself is, ""What would I do?"" My answer to the question is, ""I would have stayed.""

2080224,5,B0002DRDCS,"That said, I rarely understand critics. This movie is wonderfully entertaining - the producers could never, ever have produced an accurate version of the alluring Alamo saga because there isn't one. Often said to be the most controversial event in American history. The Pina accounts, long thought to be forgeries have recently pretty much been shown as such - other than that NO ONE knows what really happened at the end, the only living witnesses (primarily Susanna Dickinson) were hidden away (obviously) as the battle got going. It lasted about 30 to 90 minutes and no one was left alive to tell the tale. On the other side were primarily poor, Mexican soldiers who, in a society that was very segmented, would have been considered out of their station to give an account, so none did. Some Mexican officers did, but the Alamo was not (then) considered significant and so they said very little. Accounts from much later, like Pina, are forgeries, the only account from him we know to be real reveals he knew very little of those 90 minutes also - no one really did. Napoleon wrote (paraphrase) that a soldier sees not the battle but just what is in front of him at the moment - as a combat veteran, how true! So, a quick frantic 90 minutes of slaughter on both sides and it was done. Discussions about the Alamo will go on for ever no doubt. The movie makers were... making a movie - and a great watch it is. To show Travis as a man in the wrong place at the wrong time, and not really wanting to be there - and Bowie as a land grabbing, grubby little angry drunk - and Houston as the drunken buffoon he actually was (members of the Texas council wrote of their frustration that Houston would not leave the grog-shops to go to Alamo - he had no real reason he just didn't take the Alamo situation seriously) although it was said he was amiable - David Crockett was flawed but is the closest of all to our perception of him. This would have been accurate, but would it have been watchable? - I doubt it. A depressing tale that would overshadow the bravery. No, this was amazingly done, put together in the best way the producers could. Alamo fanatics can never, and will never be satisfied and all await the day when we discover an authentic manuscript that answers all the questions (good luck with that). Great movie, don't pay heed to Alamo historians, they shred everything 'Alamo' given the mass of unknowns it contains. Also like to mention I loved Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of Col. David Crockett - moving and refreshing. Watch this, it's deeply moving. Hang the minor accuracy issues - every man there was a brave hero (even debauch old Sam came out of the grog-shops eventually) - we don't have the detail of it all, but we no doubt have the feel and emotion!",1371081600,2,2776,4.5208747514910534

I had feared an Alamo remake would turn out to be a diatribe of political correctness. instead, Hanclock weaves recently unearthed historical evidence into the familiar tale, making Crokett, Bowie and others come alive as living, breathing humans instead of sterotypes. The only criticism is of the film not ending with Crockett's death...I think i might have had a more abridged version of Houston's vixtory at San Jacinto at the start, instead of taking up the last 1/3 of the film. That is a tiny nit to pic, though. This is a wonderful film with super performances by Thornton and Quaid.",1369180800,,760,4.637037037037037
2080227,5,B0002DRDCS,"I live in a city in which many of the downtown streets are named after Alamo heroes: Travis, Crockett, Milam, and Texas, our main street. Note: just as in history, Houston was not there or here. I digress only to say I grew up with names of Alamo heroes  frequently spoken, like mantras to remember long-ago heroes.

My sister and I visited the Alamo just a year ago and stood in many of the spots where blood was spilled and legends made. So it was only natural that I watch this movie when it recently played on a movie channel. John Lee Hancock's ""The Alamo"" is not John Wayne's version. The older version was made during the years following World War II, when inspiring myth-making was in full ascent.

This recent version is much grittier and more likely, although several reviewers gorgeously described the film as also modern myth making. I think, though, that Crockett's last filmic words were actually spoken, as I remember hearing them before, probably by one of the Alamo specialists at the time of our tour. ""Here's your last chance to surrender. Turn in your arms and I promise no harm will come to you"" are words out of Crockett's mouth to the huge crowd of surrounding Mexican soldiers. Note: Crockett was bound and on his knees. Another reviewer attributed Crockett's words to the journal of one of the Mexican leaders, with the knowledge that leaders keep these records of their (hopefully) heroic and historic deeds.

Billie Bob Thornton, of all actors, plays Crockett and does so with low- and high-keyed perfection. In fact, the most memorable scene of the film occurs during the evening when the Mexican band would play its prelude to cannon firing. Crockett takes his fiddle on the upper level of the fort in full view of the Mexican soldiers and, during their playing of the battle prelude, plays his own haunting melody, creating a Texian version of meaning (the movie uses ""Texian"" rather than Texan). It's a moment to savor.

Other notable actors include Patrick Wilson (a long-time favorite of mine after seeing him in ""Phantom of the Opera""). Travis seeks to be elected leader of the Alamo fighters, but meets opposition from some of his own men. He is notorious because he abandoned his wife and children, for visiting prostitutes, and gambling. Toward the end, when a dying Bowie (played carefully by Jason Patric), asks Travis for a dying drink, Travis responds--with tongue in cheek: ""I visit prostitutes, gamble, abandon children, but I draw the line at alcohol.""

(As an historical side note: There is a museum/gift shop located next door to the Alamo. On display are several versions of Jim Bowie's designs for the Bowie knife. And let me tell you--that design is incredibly horrific!!!)

The film itself is simply awesome, the story vividly retold on cellluloid for posterity. I plan to purchase the film, this version, for my own record of one of America's most important battles. ""Remember the Alamo"" is a slogan to denote the brutal slaughter of every single Texan fighter and became a battle cry for all ages and all times, its symbolic significance deeply ingrained in our national subconscious.",1368748800,4,3136,4.850467289719626

2080229,4,B0002DRDCS,"All movies about historical events need to be accurate ""and"" entertaining, otherwise they will flop in the box office.  Some reviewers slam this movie because they believe the facts have been watered down or are completely wrong.  As one reviewer says, all of the true history and facts still remain debatable and will be forever.  Given that, the movie did fairly well depicting what most believe to be fact.  From the entertainment perspective, the film is very watchable and keeps ones attention throughout.  The acting, scenes, costume and effects were very well done.  Story telling is always subject to the views and whims of those telling the story.  Sort of like the ""news media"" today!  Getting past that and the potential of less than accurate truth, the movie was very well done and worth the time to watch.  In my opinion, was the best movie yet about the Alamo.

What was the purpose of telling a story that essentially treats the incident as meaningless?  But beyond the confused intention, it's simply a terrible movie.  Slow, talky, dull and incoherent.  The casting is absurd.  None of the characters are believable. Even the soundtrack is awful and seems out of place more often than not.  As for the writing, how's THIS for drama --  at the climax of the film when a soldier is shot, he remarks ""I got killed"" to which Crocket's response is ""I'm sorry about this mess.""  I laughed out loud at that one.  This movie is an insult to the story of the Alamo and it's an insult to  the audience.  It's  pretentiousness attempting to be relevance.

2080235,4,B0002DRDCS,"I am a history major so I enjoyed The Alamo. However, it does get rather tedious. I've watched it at least three times since its release in 2004 and two of those times, I had to stop it in the middle and sleep for the night, then watch the end later. That may just be me, because I sometimes have insomnia and when I get tired, it's best for me to give in and rest, so I'm not sure if it means anything about the movie or if it was just coincidence in the times when I picked to watch it.

Patrick Wilson as William Barret Travis played a very likeable character for someone who really had done pretty despicable things in his past. The movie reminds us that people often went west to start a new life and were sometimes running from and trying to escape their past. I do not know much about Travis as a historical figure, but after watching the movie, would like to do some research to learn more. Patrick Wilson made Travis seem rather wimpy but shows how Travis grew into his own as the events unfold.

Billy Bob Thornton does an incredible job as Davy Crockett.  I learned a lot about Crockett from the movie. Thornton gives a human element to the legend making Crockett more than just the hero in a bunch of tall tales.

My favorite was Jason Patric as James Bowie who is famous for his knife now popularly known as a Bowie knife. Now that's a knife! I like Jason Patric anyway, not just because he is damn good looking, but also because he is a damn good actor.  I read that he drank shots of Tabasco Sauce to make his performance at the end of The Alamo seem more believable. Now, that is  dedication to the craft! It definitely worked. He was my favorite character in the movie, not just because I have a crush on him.

I liked the portrayal of the woman who tended to Bowie (the sister of Maria Ursula de Veramendi, Bowie's deceased wife) although I could not find her name in the credits. Ursula Veramendi is played by Safia Gray. You could see that the sister took care of Bowie because she was in love with him, not just because they were family.  Emilio Echevarria also did a good job making Santa Anna look like a real prick.

Dennis Quaid is mediocre as Sam Houston. For such a great figure in history, you would think they could have found someone better for the role. He does a good job at the end when explaining reasons for not attacking sooner, but I felt he lacked something in the beginning of the movie. Then again, I'm not a big Dennis Quaid fan, so I may not be the best judge.

I had forgotten that the Alamo was not just a fort, but was established as one of the famous missions of San Antonio--what survives today is the church. I also liked the use of the tree that one can still see if one tours the Alamo. I wondered about the set and how they filmed the movie. Wikipedia said that it is the largest and most expensive set ever built in North America.  If I were to give The Alamo an award, it would be ""The Best Use of an Egg Award"".",1362528000,,2965,4.211640211640212

He tried to let people know that he was not exactly the same as his legendary status.  I thought it was very brave of Davey Crockett at the end to ask General Santa Ana to surrender.  I thought that Dennis Quaid was great as Sam Houston.

2080253,5,B0002DRDCS,"To all you anti-PC folks out there who despise this film - lighten up, will you? I'm not only a conservative, but a military historian. An army doesn't run on its stomach; it runs on the mythology and ideology of what its fighting for. Rarely have I seen this so brilliantly portrayed as in this film. The historical texture of the film is magnificent, in the way of a work by John Ford, which makes moaning about very occasional historical inaccuracies and guesswork downright grousing.
In fact, since the writers got work for Disney, and so probably are of the PC Left, they might be dismally surprised to discover that people like me were so moved by this film to a deeper understanding of the oppression the Texicans were fighting, in the form of Santa Ana and his new Mexican empire, that we became more sympathetic to their cause. Yes, they insert their occasional PC lines of dialog. It doesn't spoil the work. And so what if Travis, Crockett, Houston and Bowie are portrayed as men with pasts and with faults? It makes their sacrifice more, not less, heroic, since they seem so human, and yet still larger than life. Particularly Davy Crockett, as brilliantly portrayed by Billy Bob Thornton.  As a movie junkie with a film degree (not worth spit) it shames me to admit that though I respected his work, Thornton always left me cold. How wrong can you get? His facial expressions alone are like a seminar in all that acting can be.
Unlike the 300 Spartans, who at least were knit of one piece, this is the story of men of different races and backgrounds binding themselves together to fight tyranny. As for the Mexican general Santa Ana, he is, believe me, not portrayed sympathetically, but rather as a strutting peacock who cares nothing for the lives of his men, or anyone else's, but only for his own glory. As another reviewer mentioned, the massacre at Goliad, and others, in which Santa Ana orders the ruthless execution of Texan prisoners of war against honorable tradition, shows his true, and bloody colors. In the end he gave away Texas to save his own skin. Unlike the other versions of this story such as the bloated disaster produced by John Wayne, I was so moved by this film when I screened it in a butchered version on the Military Channel that I'm ordering my own copy. Ted Turner's Gettysburg is one of the only other war films I've ever seen that moved me to tears. There are moments in this film that are nothing less than mythic. Unforgettable.
The first century of America's existence was plagued by governments who labeled us ""pirates,"" as does Santa Ana, who took us to be scum who couldn't or wouldn't fight, and labeled America a nation of cast-offs and runaway servants. In war after war, they would learn, to their own grief, just how wrong they were. Though Texas fought for its own freedom rather than to become a part of America, that dynamic still exists here.

2080254,5,B0002DRDCS,"This is a truly amazing film from the standpoint of historical recreation.  It is a far cry from the popular, but silly Hollywood adaptation produced by John Wayne et. al. in the 1960's.  If you have ever visited the Alamo and studied the layout of the original fortification you will immediately recognize how historically acurate the movie set is.  The characters in the movie are completely believable, and the script cleverly portrays their intimate personalities.  The camera work is excellent.  The costumes and props are true to life, and the battle scenes are realistic and exciting. The film acurately portrays events at the Alamo, including the pre-dawn attack by the Mexican Army (the actual battle was over by sunrise) and the alleged capture and execution of Davey Crockett by Santa Anna.  The fall of the Alamo is followed up in the movie by the defeat of Santa Anna and the winning of Texan independence, so as to complete the story.  Don't forget the Alamo, and don't miss this movie.",1338768000,,1000,4.881656804733728
2080255,3,B0002DRDCS,"THE ALAMO isn't that bad of a movie. But, it's not all that great either. It falls into the realm of typical Hollywood fare. The movie's biggest flaw is that it tries to do too much in a short amount of time. What ends up happening is that instead of getting the overarching story of the Alamo and what it was about, one ends up with a hodge-podge of a movie tied around one place and one person, Davy Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton). Make no mistake, though THE ALAMO includes a cast of Dennis Quaid, Jason Patric, and Patrick Wilson, it's Billy Bob Thornton who is the star of this movie. His portrayal of Crockett is a different take than is usually seen, but is perhaps the most realistic portrayal of Crockett seen on film; he injects a bit of humanity back into the legend that so many of us have come to know. Crockett really is the only completely developed character in the film, but there are scenes where some of the other main characters (Bowie, Travis, Juan Seguin) are fleshed out a little. It makes me think that the director, John Lee Hancock, had originally spent more time developing those characters, but because of the tight-schedule and the postponed release date when the film was first seen in theaters, he was not able to develop them as much as he wanted.

The movie gives a decent background about the events surrounding the Alamo and why the battle came to be. There's also some fairly interesting conversations that take place among the various characters. These things are not necessarily bad things, but in a movie that's centered around the most legendary battle in Texas history, they don't fit well and slow the film down.

Overall, I enjoyed THE ALAMO. I like the John Wayne version better, but there were things in this version that really made me think about the story in a new and different light. Especially of interest is the death of Crockett which presents an interesting idea. As far as I know, there are conflicting claims about how Crockett died and the version presented in this movie is one that is perfectly plausible and fits in quite well with how Crockett is portrayed throughout the rest of the movie. Whatever you think about Crockett's death, the movie is worth watching for Thornton's performance alone and for some of the minor historical details that have been kept in tact (such as clothing, musical composition, etc.).",1338768000,5,2374,4.677033492822966
2080256,5,B0002DRDCS,"This somewhat ironic take on the events surrounding The Battle of the Alamo is much to my liking, as is Billy Bob's Thornton's whimsical depiction of Davy Crockett (exhibiting a persona somewhat akin to that of 1930's cowboy philosopher Will Rogers).  As distinct from his portrayal by Fess Parker in the mid 1950's or that of John Wayne in the 1960 Alamo movie, Thornton plays the famous frontiersman in a way more in accord with the jocular tone that is associated with what is known of his personality and amusing quips.  Other reviewers have remarked on Crockett's parodying fiddle accompaniment of the Mexican army's grim bugle call ""Degueollo"" (cut-throat), signalling the intent to give the defenders of the Alamo no quarter--that is, to take no prisoners!

This ironic tone is very much in keeping with actual historical events, as the defense of the Alamo, in military terms, was Quixotic at best rather than worthy of its characterization as ""The Thermopylae of the West"" in Texas hagiography.  For a written account of the Texas revolution that celebrates such absurdities with comparable gusto, I recommend to the reader Jeff Long's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Duel-of-Eagles-The-Mexican-and-U-S-Fight-for-the-Alamo/dp/0688072526/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Duel of Eagles: The Mexican and U.S. Fight for the Alamo</a>.",1331337600,2,1377,5.835820895522388

2080258,4,B0002DRDCS,"As I write a few days from the coming year 2012, I am reminded that it is getting on to the 200th Anniversary of the Battle of the Alamo, a minuscule battle as these go, but still, as one of the first reviews shown at this time, indicates, one of the myths of how the United States was created. Actually, it is quite difficult to make Bunker Hill, Concord and the Shot Heard Round the Wall, Grant's great march to outflank Vicksburg, and, of course, almost anything done by George Washington, most likely the single man most critical to the existence of the Nation, seem real. This is because the function of a Nation's Founding Myth requires that it not be reducible to its actual human substance, to the foibles, weakness and errors even the greatest share with the rest of us. The Alamo is a much better picture than I thought it could be, having been made recently.
While each sub-group of the society has its OUTSIZED myths regarding friends and enemies among the Notables, still there is a stronger element of cynicism than has been so general in the past (or, at least, many commentators tell us that is the case).
At any rate, the admixture of seeming reality and ""creative story telling"" is pretty good in this film. We do get real-seeming people, and, unlikely heroics, mixed in. At any rate, I did enjoy the film, did not feel it was overblown or half-baked. While dramatically the last sequence was a psychological necessity (a way of saying, a box office necessity) still it was not in the least objectionable). I knew the name of only one of the actors (Quaid) but all of those bearing historic names, him included, did about as well as could be done. I had no feeling similar to that one gets watching Cary Grant playing Cole Porter although the differences between life and film may have been just as gross.
In sum, this should not be just a Western but The Alamo to you, and that should provide an entertaining two plus hours watching.",1324944000,,1952,4.548295454545454

2080260,2,B0002DRDCS,Not recommended. 10 minutes was more than enought for this movie. Thanks to fast forward. Boring. Couldn't get into it.,1323475200,2,119,5.0
2080261,5,B0002DRDCS,"Nobody knows exactly what happened within the walls of Alamo during the siege.  Yes, we do have Travis' and a few other letters sent to Houston or others.  We also have the records of various couriers sent by Travis.  We have the testimony of Travis' slave, Joe, who seems to have sought safety immediately on the death of Travis.  We also have testimony--multiple, constnatly varying testimonies, really--of Susannah Dickenson, one of the women who survived the final assault.  The problem is that Dickenson's account--probably heavily influenced by different reporters--varied wildly over the years.  Of course, the women and small children survived the battle but few were in a position to view the final moments of battle.

A major source of information is Mexican which is simultaneously part of the problem.  Col. Enrique de la Pena--an officer who not only despised Santa Ana but was encarcerated by the Generalissimo and eventually died in prison--reported that some Texans were taken prisoner and executed by sword-wielding Mexican soldatos at Santa Ana's commend.  The problem is that de la Pena described one prisoner who could have conceivably been Davy Crockett.  The Colonel described a tall frontiersman of regal bearing wearing [I think] a cap made of animal fur.  He died like a man, according to de la Pena.

The problem is neither de la Pena nor any other Mexican knew anything about Davy Crockett at the time.  They certainly didn't realize that they had an ex-Congressman--a man of legendary exploits--bottled up in the fort.  Assuming that de la Pena was an accurate observer the 'tall frontiersman' could have described a number of men in the Alamo.  It might have even described Davy Crockett, although Crockett wasn't particularly tall.  This is the version the writers and directors of this of 'The Alamo' chose to follow and they might be right.  We'll never know because all the defenders at Alamo were killed and the dead tell no tales.

I commend this movie because, although it is slow at the beginning, the writers, directors and producers seemed to make an honest effort to build and retell the tale as accurately--or almost as accurately--as possible.  Some Texas nationalists have tremendous problems with any kind of depiction of Texian P.O.W.s after the battle, especially if one of them was Davy Crockett.  I don't.  Virtually any man in Alamo--with the possible exception of William Barret Travis--would have surrendered at point of a bayonet IF given the opportunity to do so.  Most didn't have such an opportunity.  Many died on the spot.  Others, wounded or perhaps attempting to surrender, would have been slain by vengeful Mexican troops FOLLOWING SANTA ANA'S ORDERS of 'deguello'--no quarter.  If any Texans were actually taken prisoner it would have been strictly against Santa Ana's explicit orders.  Whether or not a Texan lived or died was primarily a function of the instincts of a particular Mexican fighter.

As much as we might like to think so, 200 or so Texian troops weren't suicide troops, which is exactly what makes their story all the more remarkable and compelling.  The real moment of truth came NOT when Mexican troops were scaling the walls but, days earlier, when almost all Texians and Tejanos decided to stay despite the fact that such a decision was LIKELY to result in the death of every one of them.  These men weren't land-bound Kamikazes bound for Shintoist Heaven.  If anything this particular group of men was composed of even sterner stuff.

By the way, one of these days somebody will make a film about the battle and aftermath of the Battle of Coleto outside of Goliad.  In terms of ginning up Texian hatred prior to, during and after the Battle at San Jacinto, Goliad was more significant than Alamo.  In San Antonio/Allamo two hundred men--knowing exactly what fate was in store for them--thumbed their nose at Santa Ana and died to the man.  At Goliad/Coleto--under the incompetent leadership of Fannin--400 Texas troops were ordered to surrender to Urrea, a Santa Ana cavalry general.  Urrea offered these men decent terms of surrender but Santa Ana--learning about it later--disavowed the terms and ordered all 400 murdered in cold blood.  This was a war crime of the first magnitude and, all by itself, warranted Santa Ana's execution.  As Houston said, however, ""I WANT TEXAS"", and Santa Ana, that third-rate general and first-class coward, signed away his country to save his own worthless hide.",1316476800,3,4480,5.038043478260869
2080262,5,B0002DRDCS,"Like the new version of True Grit, I wasn't expecting much from a remake of another classic John Wayne film, but this isn't really a remake.  It's a re-telling of a historical event.  The attention to detail and historical accuracy is greatly appreciated and shines through in this film.  I enjoyed the additional background on Crockett and Houston at the beginning of the film, and especially enjoyed the ending, in which the audience sees what eventually happened to Santa Anna and to Texas.
As much as I enjoyed Dimitri Tiomkin's clever score to the original, including the Deg&uuml;ello tune he created for Rio Bravo, Carter Burwell's score reveals his skill at creating a score that true to the period and historical facts.  The Deg&uuml;ello tune heard in this film IS the tune played by Santa Anna's buglers.  It's even in the historically accurate key of G (unlike many YouTube recreations of the tune), demonstrating a knowledge of military bugles of the period and location.
I also recommend the Bonus Features, for those interested in film making as well as Texas history.",1315267200,2,1083,4.961325966850829
2080263,1,B0002DRDCS,"Yes, Yes, Yes, I know this film was made 7 years ago and I'm just doing a review of it. Be that as it may, here's my modest review of this film. I was VERY happy to know at first that a film on the Alamo was going to be made. Then Disney stated that it was gonna cost between 100 & 130 MILLION dollars to make. SO, what did we all get in the end? A good film? Decent action shots? What did we get for all that PR money spend to make it? NADA. As a matter of fact, a GREAT BIG FAT Nada of a film. The compound was jerked around, the world famous Alamo chapel was in line with the long barrack, Crockett surrendering on his knees (how silly this was to see), the Alamo compound looked like a stubby shoebox as viewed sideways, and that north wall! Who's frick'in idea was it to put a crown on top of the north wall? There's sooo much more I could comment on here. The music was terrible too. One last thang here, when I saw the Mexican soldiers sneaking under trees, I immediately thought, ""what the h*ll is going on now, what's that?"" Then I realized they were creeping through the abatis in front of the palisade on the southside of the fort, which never happened in the real battle. The actors were fine, but the movie.....OMG! It's not even a good action movie! John Wayne's version may have been twisted around so that the only REAL thing was the title of the film, but at least it had GOOD action in it! I only wish that The Alamo(2004), could have at least been a good action movie, but it wasn't! I'm I being too harsh on this film? I think not, it made ONLY 25 million dollars worldwide! Yet it cost over 100 million to make, so I guess that my opinion on this film IS shared by MILLIONS of other people too!",1312502400,2,1715,4.091988130563799

Having just returned from a trip to Texas, I was immersed in all things Alamo and ready for a good movie version, and this is it.  It is especially important that they gave a good account of the events leading up to the actual battle, which only lasted a half-hour and was more of a massacre anyway.  If you just want the battle, isn't there a John Wayne version?

Insofar as I have learned, it is quite accurate historically.  They point out that the men at the Alamo came to be settlers, not to fight a war, and Jim Bowie even married into a prominent local family.  The film also shows the contribution of the Tejanos (those of Mexican descent living in Texas) to the independence movement, which was significant even before the American settlers arrived.  But I think you have to be a native Texan to get worked up about how Davy Crockett was killed; myth is a big deal there.  And I have a minor quibble.  ""Listen to the Mocking Bird"" played at the beginning of the film wasn't published until 1855, 20 years after the event.

This film is a good film in the sense that it shows a more balanced account of the historical events that occurred in the 1836 Texas Revolution.  However, I don't think the film quality does it for me. There's something lacking in the cinamatography...it doesn't have an epic quality to it, and seems to look like a made for T.V. movie.  Now, having said that, I still went and saw the film twice when it first came out, and I own the DVD.  Thank God for finally allowing Juan Seguin to be a central character to Texas history. Thank God also for allowing the character of Santa Anna to tell it like it was....Anglo-Americans were land pirates who promoted the institution of slavery, and who therefore, should be shown no mercy.

In the last decade I don't think any film has been as overlooked or as underrated as 2004's The Alamo.  People have just been unnatural cruel to this film in ways I don't feel are warranted.  A $90-$95 million production budget, and between $40-60 million in advertising The Alamo made a gross of roughly $25 million in its theatrical run- the second biggest flop of all time.  The fact of the matter was that not many people were going to go out of their way to see a costume drama based on an event that only directly effects the history of a single state in the United States...But as a native Texan I can't help but be impressed by this film's attention to detail.  This isn't Hollywood's Alamo.  This is History's The Alamo.

If you're born and raised in Texas few things are more important to our heritage than the siege of this Spanish-mission-turned-fort.  Davy Crockett, Sam Houston, James Bowie, William Travis, and Juan Seguin are shown as heroes to Texan children from a young age.  The Alamo and the defeat of Santa Anna's army at San Jacinto are the events that live in the hearts of every native Texan.  In our native state Texans are surrounded by the monuments, and in 7th grade we have a full year history course dedicated solely to the founding of Texas.  Before we were the 28th state Texas was the Republic of Texas and our state proudly teaches its children this fact.  Texans have a great amount of pride for their heritage.  This 2004 movie recreates history as accurately as possible.  Most of the actors are Texans, the director and producer are Texas- even the extras for the Alamo defenders, Republic of Texas army, and Mexican army are all natives to Texas.  By this the film possesses an enormous heart for it is clear that all those involved wanted to get history right.

By getting history right The Alamo also sacrifices its chance of being a success for anyone who doesn't hold a passion for the events.

The film gives just over an hour of exposition setting up the political climate of the events leading up to the battle.  This is dry at times and really I can understand why folks who could careless about the history would doze off during this portion of the film.  But once the siege begins I feel the film does a fine job at creating compelling action while doing their best at keeping it historically accurate.  Some things take suspension of disbelief (Crockett snipes off Santa Anna's epaulette) but the siege's attention to historical accuracy is outstanding.  It really captures the peril and claustrophobia that must have been felt by the defenders.  When Santa Anna's forces charge the Texan stronghold in the dead of night the entire situation dissolves into chaos.  Some have criticized the night siege (As opposed to previous film adaptations that changed the final siege to day) because of the lack of visibility.  I think it works perfectly because it thrusts the viewer straight into the confusion that no doubt occurred once the Alamo's walls were breached.

The acting in The Alamo is a mixed bag and if anything is the only thing that keeps it from reaching true greatness.  All the principal actors have their key moments, but some get one good scene and that's it.

Dennis Quaid, a native of Houston, Texas tries his best to make Houston a noble figure, but often comes across as being overly gruff in his portrayal.  He gets the warrior and general but doesn't capture enough of the gentlemen in his portrayal.  Jason Patric makes a fine James Bowie, and Patrick Wilson does an okay portrayal of William Travis, but when it comes time for Travis' ""line in the sand"" speech Wilson does a superb job that makes up for what is mostly a forgettable performance. Emilio Echevarria is villainous as he is despicable as Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, capturing the image of a pompous dictator who believes he's on par with Napoleon Bonaparte, but he never takes the performance to campy levels.  He is perfectly believable as a man who simply is a sadistic creep.

The stand-out performance of the film has to be Billy Bob Thornton as a humanized portrayal of David ""Davy"" Crockett.  Perhaps the best moment in the entire film is when, on the final night Crockett lifts his violin and plays a companion to the Mexican army's ""Degello"" (slit-throat).  Thornton (who even learned to play the violin for the role) is a sophisticated Crockett, neither the folk legend, nor the heroic crusader (John Wayne).  Thornton's Crockett is a frontiersman turned gentleman and diplomat, but this in no way takes away from his heroism.  Crockett's valor and sacrifice resonates even deeper with a viewer when he can be related to.

The Alamo has its flaws, but I believe that history buffs and Texans wishing to see the events adapted accurately will enjoy this film a great deal.  If anything the film should be seen for Billy Bob Thornton giving one of the best performances of his career.",1294790400,8,4940,4.715617715617715

2080269,5,B0002DRDCS,"Thankfully we have DVDs today with a whole lot of extras.  The ones in this DVD has some added historical information that may clarify in places the events leading up to and surrounding the Alamo battle and beyond.  Always lacking though is a real clarity, because in reality there are many things that we will never really know, how many Texians fought in the Alamo, how many died on both sides, and of course, what were people really doing and saying during the siege.

In all, this is a great rendition and appealing one regarding the story of Texan independence, how it was not all glory and rather confusing at times for all concerned.  The movie attempts for us to get very personal with the lead players in the tragedy.  We get a view into the lives of Sam Houston, Jim Bowie, Davy Crockett and Colonel William Travis with a little less than the old western style glorification giving us a deeper human look to our heroes.  There are interesting snippets where those of Mexican descent fighting with the Texians are wondering about their allies.

We get a view in this film too from the perspective of Santa Ana and his leadership as they prepare to do battle at San Antonio de Behar and await the relief column from Sam Houston that never comes.  Santa Ana seems a bit tame for a dictator, but he still blusters and his staff though loyal to him attempt to convince him to be civil in the face of a bitter struggle.

Calling the defenders of the Alamo ""Pirates"" they will be all killed, no mercy given to any.  That is really one of the sadder stories of the fight for Texan independence.  Even Fannin, who was at Goliad, lost most of his 300 plus men to execution who surrendered after the fall of the Alamo. They were slaughtered.  But, the US, as usual, forgets Goliad, which according to history was also part of the call that included Remember the Alamo.

We get some interesting snippets of Billy Bob Thornton who does an amazing job with Crockett, you really like this guy.  He is really a positive and respectful person, juxtaposed to Bowie and Travis who are more fixated on themselves.  Yet, they are thrown in together for the fight of their lives which we know is a fight to the death.

Yes, the movie is slow in places, so is a seige, at least one would imagine so.  The film has a grittiness to it as the forts occupiers sit and await their destiny.  One scene with Crockett sitting with his men manning the south barricade looks like a civil war photograph, givings us a sense of reality.

The battle scene is moving, up to and including the death of Crockett.  Look for the extras which discuss his death from a historical persepective.  The movie takes us to the battle of San Jacinto which is the culmination of the battle for Texas.  There are a few tidbits that are given as usual about the lives of those involved.  More on Santa Ana would have been interesting, like is introducing chicle (chewing gum) to the US.

2080270,5,B0002DRDCS,"I recently visted San Antonio, Texas and the Alamo, so I ordered this movie to learn more about this famous American battle, where around 200 brave men made the ultimate sacrifice for Freedom. They fought against Mexico's Ruler & Dictator, General Santa Anna and his vast army of about 4,000 men. The defenders of the Alamo lived 13 days of ""glory"", before they finally fell to Santa Anna's vast army. These 13 days bought time for General Sam Houston to put together an army of volunteers, so the defenders of the Alamo did not die in vain. This movie stars Dennis Quaid as General Sam Houston, and Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett. It's another fantastic movie about the battle of the Alamo, and how Davy Crockett was defiant to the very end. In this movie, he was the lone wounded survivor, and he offered Santa Anna a chance to surrender to General Sam Houston, but Santa Anna laughed and killed him. Then Santa Anna and his vast army went on, to take on General Sam Houston and his army of voluteers. General Sam Houston came up with the slogan ""Remember the Alamo"", in motivating his troops for battle.

2080272,5,B0002DRDCS,"Although John Wayne's 1960 Alamo is an undying classic I say that 2004 version is the best. A lot more poetic liberty was taken in the first like for example the wide main street set for San Antonio. In fact, as was shown in the 2004 movie San Antonio in 1836 was centered on a plaza. Also I think the actors that played Bowie, Travis, Houston, and Crockett in this one did such a magnificent job. I can't believe the reviews did not reveal how powerful the film truly is. Also, it was wonderful to see the great battle of San Jacinto in this one.

My only complaint is the politically correct and pretentious way the slaves of Bowie & Travis are shown. Letters and some first hand accounts that survived the battle mostly show that both slaves fought at savage as every Texan in the siege. Just as much as Hispanic's should be proud of their Texas Revolution sires like Juan Seguine so should black Texans when remembering the two slaves that actually served uncomplaining in that colorful battle.",1281657600,,998,4.544444444444444

I'm glad some of you loved the movie so much, whatever you were taking at the time should be prescribed along with the movie. I just found this movie extremely weak. The Alamo was great, this movie is not.

Would not watch this version again. Sorry if I can't further describe why this movie is so lame because I might just tell you the whole plot of the movie while I'm at it. Since there's so many people that like this movie, I guess most likely you'll like it too. I am truly disappointed because I waited so long and expected so much from this.

Quaid's portrayal of Sam Houston, and Thornton's Crockett were done superbly. Patric's Jim Bowie rounds out the trio
with each role not overshadowing the other. One part of the story which was not shown in this film is when Col William Barrett Travis supposedly drew the line in the sand with his saber when addressing the defenders. This has always been in controversy and the director shied away from that.

2080278,5,B0002DRDCS,"The movie is about the Mexican War. The war was fought between thousands of Mexicans and a few hundred Texans for the ownership of Texas. The Texas army was lead by three historical commanders William Travis, James Bowie and David Crockett. At the end of the movie, the Texans won the battle, even though they were highly out numbered.
  Overall I enjoyed the movie because the acting and the scenery was amazing.  Billy Bob Thornton truly understood his role as David Crockett and personalized it by adding his own southern accent and heartfelt emotion.  While  Jason Patric played the role of James Bowie, a commander of the Texan army who bravely fought in the war. The  scenery was breathe taking  because it felt like you were actually in Texas during the war.
 Overall I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars. So if you like action, drama, and historical films then you will like this one.",1239580800,,890,4.624203821656051

2080280,3,B0002DRDCS,"For me,this movie was a near miss. Having read ""A Time to Stand"" by Walter Lord , and other books about the Alamo, I had come to expect certain things when I entered the theater to view this movie. Yes, this IS in fact the best movie about the Alamo made thus far. Billy Bob Thornton portrayal of David Crockett was amazing. The movie skirted the controversial issues of how Crockett died, and whether or not Travis drew a line in the dirt with his sword - and did it in convincing and dramatic ways. But there were seceral things that irritated me. Number 1 was the location of the Alamo Church. That building was recessed back about (?) 50 feet from the long barracks, but in the film,they had it almost as an extension of it. I don't understand this seeing as they went to great lengths to show that the San Fernando Church could be seen from the platform through a window (true). Number 2, and incomprehensible to me, was the scene when the Mexicans arrived. Here's what really happened. The sentry rang the bell and said that he had spotted the Mexicans. Travis and Bowie ran up to the roof and could see nothing. Then the sentry rang it again a few minutes later. This time, two men - Sutherland and Smith decided to ride out and see for themselves telling Travis that if he saw them coming back at anything other than a trot, he would know that the Mexican army had arrived. They rode out,mounted a rise,saw the vanguard of the Mexican army and started to gallop back. Sutherland's horse stumbled, and he got thrown from his horse, breaking his leg. Smith helped him up and they rode back to town at a gallop. This (the truth) is MUCH more exciting than what the film did (basically nothing). The third thing was the treatment of the 32 men from Gonzales. No film has gotten this right - in fact this could be a film all of its own. Santa Anna had thrown a screen around the roads leading to the Alamo (the Gonzales and Goliad roads). The Gonzales men were able to sneak in bacause a ""Northen"" was blowing. The Mexicans being for the most part too busy trying to stay warm. As they approached the northen postern (NOT the main gate), an alert Alamo sentry shot at one of the Gonzales men shooting him in the foot. The man let out an oath that only an American would utter - thus gaining entry into the fort. Number 4 - The return ride of James Butler Bonham (""I will return or die in the attempt"") - a very dramatic scene. Number 5 - there are few direct quotes that can be supposedely proved to have been from the Alamo - and I waited for this one - ""Great God Sue,the Mexicans are inside our walls"" - nope. Number 6 - and simply inacurate for a film that prided itself on its accuracy. There is a scene in the movie in BROAD DAYLIGHT right under the noses of a Mexican artillery bettery not 250 yards away of the Texians making repairs to the north wall. Nope. In fact, the film got the whole thing backwards. The Mexican artillery bombardment was during the DAY. At night, there would be bugle calls, ocassionally the band would play the Deguello, fake charges, and occasional rocket and cannon fire - all to deprive the defenders of sleep. It was during THIS time that Travis had his men out trying to repair the damage done to the walls (especially the north wall) from the previous days' bombardment. Doing this in broad daylight, in plain view of a completely silent and uncaring Mexican artillery battery is just plain silly. All of this aside, this is STILL the best movie on the Alamo ever made. I just wish..... Maybe someday a movie on the 32 man from Gonzales will be made.",1231632000,3,3593,4.380239520958084
2080281,5,B0002DRDCS,"The Alamo was originally an adobe mission compound on the outskirts of San Antonio. The film starts at the end of the battle. News of its fall reaches the Texans. Then the story begins one year earlier. Sam Houston wants to go to Texas. David Crockett, former Congressman, is a legend in his own time. [The show ""Lion of the West"" is a pun on Crockett's story-telling.] The Texicans (like other Mexican states) oppose the military rule of Santa Anna (who worked for the big bankers and landowners). There are personality conflicts between the Texians, and the conflicting policies for the defense of the state. [You need to know the history to understand some of the scenes.] The Alamo is the sole defense against the Mexican Army. Santa Anna made a winter march for a surprise attack. Captured rebels (or freedom fighters) are executed by Santa Anna.

The militia voted for their leader (democracy). Travis commands the regulars, Bowie the volunteers. There were no sentinels watching for the expected return of Santa Anna's forces, which greatly outnumbered the Texians. The defenders prepare for the worst. The Mexican artillery fires at night to deprive the defenders of sleep. Colonel Travis bravely recycles a cannon ball. Sam Houston wants a unified command. Houston doesn't have enough soldiers to relieve the siege of the Alamo. Santa Anna allows some to leave the Alamo. There is a red sky at evening. Some write letters to home. Santa Anna will take no prisoners.

Santa Anna ordered a simultaneous attack on all sides to overwhelm the defenders with numerically superior forces. [The Texans had better quality gunpowder.] After a while the battle is over. David Crockett resists to the bitter end. The Texians retreat east. Santa Anna splits his forces to pursue the refugees. General Houston knows the Mexican forces will become weaker, and the opportunity to attack will come. The battle of San Jacinto was over in 18 minutes. Santa Anna signed a treaty recognizing the independence of the Republic of Texas. Nine years later Texas became the 28th state. The war with Mexico followed and led to the expansion of America.

This film was said to be more historically correct than John Wayne's 1960 film, but it is less dramatic. This version correctly ends with the victory at San Jacinto, but skips over the massacre at Goliad. As entertainment, the 1960 film is better. You should read a book to best understand any historical film. Neither film did well at the box office, few historical dramas do well. It's difficult to pack weeks of history into a few hours without skimming over facts. This film shows the character of Santa Anna better than the 1960 film.  A decade later Texas joined the United States. Then Mexico declared war on America, and lost California and the other territories.",1222732800,,2807,4.928118393234672
2080282,4,B0002DRDCS,"Hands down, this is the most authentic and realistic screen adaption of the Alamo story ever made.  ( The second best is an IMAX film called ""The Price of Freedom"", which can only be seen in San Antonio,TX as far as I know.)
I have nothing against the Wayne-amo.  I first saw it on TV when I was about 6 and loved it.  I bashed in imaginary soldado skulls with the stock of my Red Ryder BB gun for weeks afterward.  (Mom was worried.)
However, the simple fact remains that the 1960 Alamo was more a statement on John Wayne's character and political beliefs than a dramatization of a historical event.  Great battle scenes, rousing score, and almost void of historical accuracy.
I have been suprised at the amount of whining concerning ""revisionist history"" and ""political correctness"" concerning the most recent Alamo film.  I have met and spoken with both of the historians that worked on this film, and neither Stephen Hardin nor Col. Alan Huffines are what I consider revisionist.  They have both written excellent books on the Texas Revolution, and Hardin's ""Texian Iliad"" is considered to be one of the finest works on the subject.
Many reviewers have mentioned ""A Time to Stand"" by Walter Lord as being the best book about the Alamo.  It is certainly one of the best, but it is a bit dated ( written in 1961.) For my money, the best Alamo book is ""Three Roads to the Alamo"", by William C. Davis.",1216080000,3,1401,4.576
2080283,5,B0002DRDCS,"For serious students of history of the Alamo, director John Lee Hancock's ""The Alamo"" can't be beat. Every phase of the battle (a night battle which lasted about 90 minutes) is accurately depicted. The movie shows how outlying sentries, sleep deprived after days of shelling, were bayoneted during the initial charge, how the Mexican battalions first scaled the north wall where Travis was killed, shot between the eyes, how defenders retreated into buildings lining the walls where terrible close-quarters fighting took place, and how the last defenders, including David Crockett, retreated into the chapel at the end.

The film presents the view that some defenders, including Crockett, were captured and executed shortly after the battle. This controversial scenario is taken from the diary of a Mexican officer, Enrique De La Pena.

I would have preferred that there be more middle and far distance scenes for those of us who love the history and are interested in military tactics. But director Hancock chose mostly close-ups of the action. This, I presume, was an artistic choice to maximize dramatic effect and my wishes to the contrary are but minor quibbles. (Boy, would I love to see the outtakes!) All in all, the film is a great achievement, the best Alamo film ever made.

The politics which led to the war are skillfully presented. The script courageously includes the fact that the Mexican people were betrayed by the Anglos to whom they had given lands in return for oaths of allegiance. Another uncomfortable truth portrayed here is that the Texian rebels fought, against Mexico, for their freedom to continue the institution of slavery.

The courage of both the Mexicans and the Gringos is shown. We see the Mexican army marching through the snow in the terrible winter of  February, 1836, with rags tied around their feet to redeem the honor of Mexico. This is no John Wayne; ""There was 10 of us and a million Mexicans"" Alamo.

But what makes any war story great is the human portrayal. This is not lacking here. The writing is delicious. On arriving in San Antonio, Crockett makes one of his famous ""Prettiest wife, ugliest dog, meaner than a snapping turtle..."" speeches. A listener says; ""Gosh, Davey, now that yer here, Santy Anny won't dare attack!"" Crockett replies with a sick grin: ""I understood the fightin' was over. Ain't it?"" Crockett had come, hopeing to become the first President of the Republic of Texas.

 The counter-intuitive choice of Billy Bob Thorton to play David Crockett was brilliant. Thorton captures Crockett's humility and compassion for the common man (Crockett opposed Jackson's removal of Native Americans from the east, realizing that these people were more like the people Crockett knew than the politicians who wanted their lands). Thorton shows us how Davey really must have felt. And Thorton manages to even look like the few extant drawings and paintings we have of Crockett. This is good acting because Crockett was alot better looking than Billy Bob!

 Jason Patric smoulders and exudes danger as Bowie and Patrick Wilson's youthfulness truly illucidates Travis' courage. Emilio Echevarria's Santa Anna is at once sympathetic in his ideals and detestible in his arrogance and cynicisim. He says: ""What are the lives of soldiers but the lives of so many chickens?"" Santa Anna ignored the tenants of  Napolianic theory of warfare which held that artillery should  breach a fortified position before infantry advance. Santa Anna ordered his men to attack the fort with ladders and ""Sappers"" carrying axes to dismantle fortifications. The Mexican soldiers did their duty.

The Alamo is America's Thermopylae. The story must be told again and again. No matter if the heroes' flaws are exposed. They are greater in the imperfections of their humanity.  It will be a long time before this story is better told.",1210636800,81,3862,5.070977917981073
2080284,4,B0002DRDCS,"I re-watched this movie after visiting Texas and the Alamo recently, and while there, bought a copy of Walter Lord's 1961 book ""A Time to Stand"" (considered by many to be the best book on the Alamo) as well as David Crockett's autobiography (I heartily recommend both), and was surprised how well the movie jived with the actual history.
I think the main reason this movie did so poorly (reading from some of the negative reviews) was that many people were expecting a remake of the 1960 movie with John Wayne and Richard Widmark. It was an excellent movie, but mostly myth- you had larger-than-life actors playing larger-than-life heroes. The 2004 movie made them more human, more down-to-earth, portraying their flaws, which does not detract from their heroism. Some may be disappointed that Travis dies early in the battle from a bullet to the head (which he did) instead of breaking his sword at the last moment, or that Crockett is captured and executed (which evidence suggests he was) instead of going down swinging Old Betsy. These people prefer the myth to reality- so be it.
Their may be some political correctness in the film- the Texans are portrayed as land-grubbing Yankees (In one scene Santa Anna tells his men their descendants will ""beg crumbs from the Americans"" if they fail). However, to a certain extent this was true- at that time, ""manifest destiny"" was the catchphrase, many Indian tribes had been force from their homes on the infamous ""trail of tears"" because white men coveted their land, and a decade later the US would go to war with Mexico and take even more territory).
Some may quibble with a couple inaccuracies in the film, but it is the most accurate depiction of the battle I've seen. If you want to see how it happened, watch this movie. If you want the myth, watch the John Wayne version.",1210636800,,1827,4.748427672955975

This movie was very close to a documentary as Billy Bob Thornton was channeling the true Davy Crocket instead of some Walt Disney version. My only criticism was that Dennis Quaid had to try too hard to be Sam Houston,a complex character easily worth an entire movie of his own. Even the scenery was incredibly detailed and accurate,giving this history buff a great deal of satisfaction. I greatly appreciate Hancock's attention to detail and respect for Texas history.",1200787200,,587,5.061855670103093
2080287,4,B0002DRDCS,"An underappreciated film that was hurt more by its attempts to please all sides than it was from any failings of authenticity. Compared to past Hollywood versions of this story, 2004's The Alamo is not only the most realistic and historically accurate depiction of the 1836 battle, it also happens to be the most elaborately staged, with great attention paid to minor details in clothing, housing, speech patterns, weaponry, and the actual battle itself.

Billy Bob Thornton's mythbusting portrayal of David Crockett (not Davy, no) steals the show here and was unjustly overlooked at Oscar time. Although the decision to conclude his presence onscreen in a scenario more in keeping with the controversial and possibly fraudulent De la Pea Diary raised a few eyebrows, it was also the most dramatic possible exit for the film's most famous individual.

The battle at the Alamo remains to this day such a passionately debated and celebrated topic that any film version is almost guaranteed to leave some segment of the population completely unsatisfied, and there were inevitably voices loudly raised when this movie was released three years ago. But as is so often the case with controversy, I found that those yelling the loudest were those who hadn't actually bothered to see the film they were denouncing. I recall how in 2004 I went online and urged a group of Texans to support this movie, and got an back an earful of negativity and (mostly misspelled) criticisms (with poor grammar) of the audacity of anyone except Texans themselves (and particularly the ""liberal"" Disney Corporation) to make a motion picture about the Alamo. Unlike all the rest of the history in the world, Texas history, they in effect claimed, belonged to them and them alone and was for them and them alone to interpret---even if their knowledge of the battle was in more than a few cases shown to be questionable.

Sadly that sort of mindset goes a long way toward explaining why a fine film like The Alamo flopped and why since then so few historical epics have been made. Why should a studio spend time and money on a project doomed to be lambasted when for a smaller investment it can create a silly star-filled story that will be more profitable?

As for me, I say for anyone who loves history, this is a good movie to see.",1197072000,2,2307,4.818181818181818
2080288,1,B0002DRDCS,"This is waste of celluloid.  The casting, the soundtrack, the acting, the photography (where was the lighting man? was it shot in the dark with past-dated film?) were an embarrassment.  Ugh.  When you say Alamo, boomers fortunately think of the John Wayne classic from 1960, considered by many the greatest film of all time.  The big three of the Alamo were heroically portrayed by John Wayne as Davy, Richard Widmark as Bowie, Lawrence Harvey as Travis, against the legendary soundtrack of Dimitri Tiomkin. Each of the big three had glorious last stands.  Davy, dying from a bayonet in the chest, with his last ounce of energy torches the powder room and blows up half the Alamo.  Bowie, laid low by a cannonball, takes out fifteen attackers with a seven barrel shotgun, two flintlocks, and that meat cleaver of a knife, before being overcome by hordes.  And Travis outfences five attackers until one shoots him, but he breaks his sword over his knee in a last act of defiance before he expires.  Billy Bob's Alamo?  Where to start?  Wayne's cast of thousands is reduced by Billy Bob to a cast of tens and the production values are straight to video quality.  There are no movie stars.  The ""music"" was an irritating wailing.  Most ridiculous moment?  Billy Bob after being captured, warning the attackers he is a ""screamer"" and then,just before being killed, well, screaming.  Davy Crockett screaming?  This is offensive to every boomer who remembers Fess Parker in the Walt Disney film climbing to the top of the Alamo, swinging ""Ol' Betsy"" and ""giving 'em what's fer"" one last time.  I am told that after the Billy Bob screaming scene the film went on another half-hour.  I wouldn't know because at that point I turned off the DVD and threw it away.

2080291,4,B0002DRDCS,"The first major Hollywood offering of the Alamo epic since John Wayne's 1960 film, this effort of Disney Studios has both its good and not-so-good points. On one hand it is a bit more historically accurate, with fewer embellishments or liberties taken with known facts and details. On the other hand it's more in line with the hero-debunking mode of current ""politically correct"" types of thinking, and in doing so injects present-day embellishments of its own on an era when people saw the world in quite different terms. In this significant respect it fails to achieve an authentic ""you are there,"" feeling. While the story is not exactly a ""western,"" an observation by Louis L'Amour is appropriate here: ""A mistake constantly made by those who should know better is to judge people of the past by our standards rather than their own. The only way men or women can be judged is against the canvas of their own time."" Imposing a late 20th- or a 21st-century viewpoint on a 19th-century situation is an absurdity that can't work -- ever. Historical accuracy must do justice not only to known facts but to known viewpoints, feelings and tenets of belief at the time and place.

 The movie's ""warts and all"" portrayal of the main characters is an example of this failing. While we don't need cardboard comic-strip heroes, the warts as shown in the main characters: Houston's drinking, Travis's by-the-book dismissal of his wife for adultery, Bowie's dour obnoxiousness, Crockett's seeming opportunism (and if so, so what?), can easily prejudice the viewer against appreciating their positive qualities that mostly show up later.  Overall the acting is good, though not great; Thornton as Crockett is best. On the Mexican side, Santa Anna is shown as the conceited tyrant he was -- in a very good performance by Emilio Echevarra, with General Castrilln his much needed but seldom heeded conscience. (In contrast, Santa Anna is scarcely shown at all in the Wayne film, and when he does appear on his white horse it's mostly at a distance.)

 A previous reviewer breezily referred to the movie's ""god-awful dirge-like flapdoodle music."" The first and last can be dismissed as nothing more than expressions of personal dislike, but the middle one has a point: Large parts of the score by Carter Burwell do have a dirge-like quality. Its overall mood, although quite accomplished and at times powerful and poignant, is lugubrious: mournful before the fact, with a sense of impending doom, and/or lament, almost from start to finish. A little respite from this would have been in order, though the Alamo's final fall with the death of all defenders was certainly as lamentable an event as they come. And even after Houston's triumph at San Jacinto the movie ends with the music's endless sombre mood. Photography is absolutely first-rate.

  The single most gripping scene in the entire film is the very first, and one of the very briefest: General Sam Houston in his tent staring in utter shock at the candle flame on his table on receiving the news that the Alamo had fallen and the entire garrison killed to a man. One can see Houston's chagrin and remorse into the depths of his soul as he suddenly realizes how his previous dithering and delay for political reasons had kept him from bringing desperately needed reinforcements in time -- which is brought out later as the story unfolds in the telling.

 The battle of San Jacinto six weeks afterward is covered in a 12-minute ending sequence. This will no doubt be welcome to viewers not familiar with exactly what followed after the Alamo fell, although it was added mainly to bring a positive note to the movie's close (according to director John Lee Hancock in the DVD's supplementary material). In terms of drama, however, it seems a bit of an anticlimax and tacked on. Instead, a brief paragraph on screen at the end could have noted the aftermath without diluting the impact of the Alamo's fall itself.

 Some comment on that event and its own aftermath is not amiss here, however. The same reviewer cited above wrote, with apparent disapproval, that the San Jacinto battle scene in the movie ""is one-sided in the extreme."" Well, in the actual fact it truly WAS. Houston learned at a critical moment that Santa Anna was where he wanted him, and -- whereas previously he had acted on the side of judicious caution while ignoring scathing criticism from his men for it -- abruptly changed tactics and, like the quick-witted general he was, seized the moment to risk stalking and attacking a force that well outnumbered his. (The movie does not note that Santa Anna's detachment of 750-odd men had that very morning been reinforced by close to 500 troops under General Cs, bringing Mexican troop strength there to about 1,250 men against Houston's 783.) Add to this Santa Anna's own smug overconfidence, and the Cs detachment particularly weary and resting after an all-night march and many of Santa Anna's men caught napping too, nobody expecting Houston's attack to come so soon  -- and not least, that the Texas volunteers were, in Walter Lord's words, blazing, fighting mad after the fall of the Alamo, their rage further intensified with many feeling a gnawing shame that they had not joined the ragtag army until too late to aid its defenders, and you have a situation where a smaller force can totally rout a larger one. Once it started, even Houston could not restrain the fury of his men. The Texans suffered only 8 dead and 18 seriously wounded (including Houston), as against the Mexicans' 600-650 dead and some 700 taken prisoner. Only it was a shame that Santa Anna's wiser and far more decent subordinate General Castrilln fell victim to their frenzy, refusing to turn his back and flee the battlefield as his generalissimo did. The next morning Santa Anna was captured wandering in the tall grass wearing tattered clothing and claiming to be a simple private until taken into Houston's camp, where some Mexican prisoners recognized him and exclaimed in astonishment, ""El Presidente! -- El Presidente!""

  With that, Texas' independence was sealed as Santa Anna signed a treaty on Houston's terms, ceding the territory to save his life. (No matter that the successor Mexican government would refuse to recognize the deal.) The 4,000 or so fully equipped Mexican troops still in Texas, 2,500 of them less than 50 miles behind on the Brazos, fortunately for the Texians obeyed Santa Anna's forced order and began a tortuous march home.  Santa Anna was allowed to return to Mexico within a year. Texians formed an independent republic with Sam Houston elected its first president and Lorenzo de Zvala, a distinguished Tejano revolutionary leader, as its first vice-president.

  In the years following more immigrants poured into Texas, especially from U.S. Southern states, along with others from the North and from Europe.

 Despite periods of exile Santa Anna remained a charismatic figure in Mexico, to become president or dictator no less than ten more times during the next seventeen years after his Texas defeat. Six years later in 1842, Santa Anna on two separate occasions again ordered forces into Texas which briefly recaptured San Antonio, the second  incursion occupying it with 1,400 troops for nine days until they were lured out of town and sent reeling back to Mexico after an ambush by a force of 600 Texas Rangers.

 After nearly ten years as a sovereign republic, Texas was admitted as a U.S. state in 1845. In 1847 Santa Anna again led Mexican armies in battle, this time against U.S. forces in the Mexican War until finally defeated by General Winfield Scott in Mexico City itself, leading to the U.S. acquiring the Southwest to the California coast.

 While this last goes beyond the scope of either movie, it shows how  ""a small affair"" (as Santa Anna characterized the Alamo battle) can set into motion truly momentous ones.

  Which film to see? -- Wayne's or Hancock's? As entertainment, or as history? See both, then decide for yourself. At first I gave  Hancock's movie four stars; Wayne's, four-plus.

  After later revisiting both several times, I'd now reverse those preferences: four and a half stars for the Hancock film, four for Wayne's. While Wayne invented a number of  scenes out of whole cloth for entertainment purposes and others to further certain cherished myths, Hancock sticks more to known historical facts and fills the gaps with reasonable conjecture based on more  recent research.

  Of course, much will never be known since no defenders survived to tell the story. (Crockett alone could have told volumes.) But both films, though showing different views of some events still under hot controversy, are very well done and very much worth seeing.",1188086400,3,8758,4.943421949556919
2080292,5,B0002DRDCS,"I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this; it is a visually stunning film, well acted and patriotic.  The characters are not cartoons; they have depth and are human.  Hancock handled the subject matter well.  There is plenty of action particularly in the 3rd act, though little blood. (PG-13 rating) A powerful film I'd recommend to anyone.",1187827200,,341,4.947368421052632
2080293,5,B0002DRDCS,"This film was fantastic.
After a recent trip to the Alamo itself, and  finishing reading the book ""A Time to Stand"" by Walter Lord, I had to go back and buy the DVD of ""The Alamo"" to refresh my memory.
When I first watched this movie on cable a couple years ago, I thought it was really good.  But after reading the W. Lord book, and actually visiting the Alamo, it ties the story of events up perfectly.  Something about being there where events unfolded some 170 years ago makes the story more vivid.
I could see Davy Crockett standing at the palisade fence line.  I could picture Col. Travis walk across the plaza. I could feel the adrenaline and the terror of the Texans as they defended the Alamo's walls.  Just knowing that this happened makes you appreciate the history a little bit more.

Billy Bob Thornton gave the best, and most outstanding performance as Crockett.  Some have questioned the ""authenticness"" of his violin duet with the Mexican army band, but in reality he did play the violin, and was noted by survivor, Mrs. Dickinson, to have played it several times during low moments of the 13 day seige.  What a lower moment than during the playing of ""Deguello"", knowing that another bombardment of the fort is minutes away. I can see Crockett playing his violin during this time.  The duet, is the writers artistic license.  I liked it.
Overall, this movie went from a 4 star to a 5 star for me.",1187481600,,1413,4.52755905511811

There are a lot of historical facts brought out in this film that some may not be aware of, and I like that.  I like it when they put a lot of effort into detail to try and show as much as they can and as accurately as they can.  Davy Crockett, Sam Bowie and other famous names from history are all on the roster for the Alamo, and the irony of how some of the tactics and battle plans ended up are very interesting.

2080298,4,B0002DRDCS,"The actual events that led to the siege of the Alamo and the establishment of the short-lived country called Texas lie shrouded in the fog of contested legends. Like the Middle East today, two peoples necessarily tell the story of the same land in far different ways. It is often said by Texans today that Mexico is achieving through immigration and fecundity what Santa Ana could not.

Under such circumstances, there is room for a dramatic retelling of one side's story. THE ALAMO does that, and superbly. Jettisoning the attempt to see events from the Mexican point of view - it would have made for more textured history but a failed film - this movie simply tells the story of a heroic stand that many of its heros must have known was doomed from the start.

In the end, Mexican General Santa Ana's Napoleonic ambitions die in an eighteen-minute battle at a place of Sam Houston's choosing.

I work with leaders. Successful leaders usually have far more opportunity to draw on patience and fortitude than heroism. Yet in the heroism of this film *and* in Houston's patience, there are many lessons.

David (or was he Davey?) Crockett wearing his legend lightly. Houston refusing to be drawn in to battle when blood and anger were running hot. A  young Lieutenant Coronel being told that 'sometimes it's just the *way* you say things' and discovering that stooping to burn his own hands on a hot cannon ball that someone else could have carried provided the elevation that had eluded him by command.

These are the film's enduring lessons. They can be told even when the history is sketchy, because somewhere, right now, some human being whose knees are shaking is becoming a hero in just this way.

A brilliant film, well shot, cunningly told, sincerely acted. Even Santa Ana would have admitted that much.",1174608000,5,1810,4.782051282051282

Also, all the hard work that went into it to make it historically acurate is amazing. I still have the awesome feeling that we experienced as a family watching when I think of it now. I grew up with an American History teacher and didn't really like to have to learn dates and times and all that stuff even for my dad's class, but if all the important events in American History could be presented like this, well then, I would love history and not forget much at all!

2080301,5,B0002DRDCS,"I agree with all the other reviewers have written so I won't repeat. I saw the John Wayne film when it was released (many years ago - I was only 7!) and loved it but was very upset that Davey Crockett, who was a hero of mine, had died. I knew nothing of The Alamo and it's history and was shocked by the ending. Since then I've always had a fascination with everything-Alamo. I was excited about the new film and thought it excellent, very well filmed and acted and just a fantastic movie.

My only challenge is the way the Crockett character was written. I thought Billy Bob Thornton stole the show, was brilliant as Crockett and the violin scene and his death scene are exceptional pieces of film that stay with you a long time. No, my point is that where I agree and liked the way his character was portrayed (multi-dimensional, flawed, down to earth) I disagree with how he seemed, at all times, to want to dispel his legend and make out that he really wasn't how most people thought of him. Well, he WAS like that when younger. He ended up at The Alamo by chance not realising the seriousness of it all but to try and tell an audience that he wasn't who he was is misleading and irresponsible. Well, that's my only negative point but this in no way interfered with my enjoyment.

I loved the film and recommend it 100%.",1157414400,41,1324,4.334677419354839

2080303,4,B0002DRDCS,"I liked this version of THE ALAMO even though I am a big fan of John Wayne's epic. Billy Bob Thornton's Davy Crockett is a bit of a conundrum. He really had no intention of actually sacrificing his life in this conflict but perhaps was more interested in enhancing his legend. Ultimately he must come to terms with who he really is and is unwittingly perhaps the most heroic figure represented here. I liked Jason Patrick's Jim Bowie because he is a man haunted by memories and is just a shell of what he once was. His fate is also inevitable. It was good to see that the follow up after the fall of The Alamo was included in this film, which gave the sacrifice of the defenders an actual visual presentation in a well-staged battle.  The prolific Carter Burwell once again composed a befitting score. This time his score for THE ALAMO is rich and full of emotion and melancholy. Burwell seeks out the motivations and dissolutions of the principal defenders as their inevitable doom becomes apparent. This is Carter Burwell's best score to date and ranks up there next to his score for PSYCHO III. I consider Dimitri Tiomkin's score for John Wayne's THE ALAMO one of the best ever composed but Carter Burwell managed to refocus his music on different elements of that pivotal battle for Texas' Independence in the year of 1836.",1153612800,2,1327,4.622881355932203
2080304,4,B0002DRDCS,"I have this thing about Disney films, that they are going to be flawed by too much Hollywood crap. The Alamo isn't Hollywood. It is a sincere effort to do the historical homework and translate the real story to screen. It worked. I only wish that it had been appreciated enough to be a success at the box office. Hopefully as a DVD it will justify its existence and gain a ""cult"" following. The people involved in the film certainly deserve at least that much.

Some intriguing details about this movie: there was evidently an effort made to select actors who resembled the historical people that they play (although Santa Ana is too old, a quibble); it was discovered that some of them are the actual descendants of those characters. There are no fictional roles, though a few are composites. The uniforms and all the details are spot-on, even down to showing zapadoris (Mexican sappers whose task was to demolish the walls of forts with their heavy axes): somebody was obviously a huge fan of the period and the story, to go to such lengths for visual authenticity.

I thought that Billy Bob Thornton stole the show. Whether or not Davy Crockett actually serenaded the Mexican military band with his violin from the wall of the Alamo doesn't matter to me: he should have, and that scene alone was a jewel.

This movie goes into my collection soon....",1152489600,7,1352,4.6722689075630255
2080305,4,B0002DRDCS,"I anticipated a OK movie, and was pleasantly surprised on how entertaining the movie was to watch.  From set and costumes to the actually characters, you get a very fine feeling of people from that time period.  Although there is obviously some guess as to the activities of the main characters, I do believe they are well drawn.  Quaid's Houston seemed a bit inconsistent, and would be the weakest character of the movie.  Undoubtedly, Thornton's acting and the script highlight Crockett as the main gem in this movie.

The action was top rate, with the special effects shots adding to the movie, not dominating.

The DVD bonus info is nice, with a bit of history, and a bit more about making the movie.

2080307,4,B0002DRDCS,"One of the first movies I remember going to see as a child was John Wayne's Alamo at the Drive-in. Since then, whenever I think of the Alamo I think of John Wayne and Richard Widmark. And the music.  Dmitri Tiomkin's score has to rank as one of the best. Though for one reason or another John Wayne's film was deprived of the recognition many believe it deserves, the film has earned a rightful place as a classic. How the Alamo SHOULD have happened. I suppose every film about the Alamo since then must be prepared to stand the comparison with John Wayne's film.

  Therefore, one has to admire the courage of the people involved in the making of this version of those thirteen history changing days. I remember the controversy surrounding the film as it was being made and when it was released. As a history teacher I am keenly aware of the assault on the ""sacred"" story by a combination of modern scholarship, revisionist historians, and (shudder) the demon of political correctness. What kind of hack-job was Hollywood and Disney about to release on us now?

  So it was with some relief I left the movie theater after seeing the film. Disney had done a pretty fair job of telling the story of the Alamo, showing respect to all sides (sorry if the folks in Mexico City were disappointed) without pandering to any; respecting the heroism of the defenders of the Alamo; and showing respect to modern scholarship without diminishing the legend.

  Yet, I still found myself disappointed with this movie. I kept wishing it would have been longer (though length doesn't necessarily improve a bad film - just watch the TV miniseries ""Thirteen Days of Glory"" though Raul Julia's Santa Ana is a work of genius).  I've read where the film was cut back from the original three hours to little over two. I can't help but wish they'd kept the other hour for character development, maybe then I would feel more empathy when the Alamo's defenders fall. I can't help but go back to John Wayne's version which appears to meander through some two and a half hours getting to the climactic scene- but at the end, you can't help but feel sadness- as if you've lost friends. Maybe its the music as Susannah Dickenson is escorted out of the mission, I don't know, but whatever it is, it's missing from this film in spite of excellent performances by all players and a sincere effort on the part of all involved to tell the story as a tribute to those fallen (see the special features on the DVD).

  I think Billy Bob Thornton has nailed David Crockett (just as Julia nailed Santa Ana in a previous version); Emilio Echevarria playing Santa Ana does a great job of capturing one of history's most itriguing enigmas, the final battle scene is great, but something is missing; more time on the characters, more time on the story itself, maybe a different score. Maybe all of those things.  What you get, though, is a really good movie and telling of the story - but not a great one.

  I find myself thinking as I show it to my high school history class that I wish they'd release the longer version on DVD. Maybe a director's cut?",1147219200,2,3112,4.566546762589928
2080308,4,B0002DRDCS,"""The Alamo"" is a gripping film about those who fought bravely at the Alamo. The film does tend to drag at a few points, but it eventually picks up steam again. What really carries this movie is the wonderful acting of Billy Bob Thorton as the American hero Davey Crockett. Thorton brings a human side to Davey, and shows that the real Crockett isn't as super-human as his legend believes and because of that legend, Davey has to try to live up to it but ultimately can't.

The film does a good job of showing the bravery of the men at the Alamo. At times you are actually cheering the people on, but those who know the story of the Alamo know how it's going to end before the film even begins. Dennis Quaid is also really good in the film as well. It brings out a little of that patriotic spirit while watching the movie and I think that's what the film makers are going for.

2080309,5,B0002DRDCS,"john lee handcock's ""alamo""is a very fine version of the oft told story of the battle between the mexican army and a group of 200 or so texans to win texas freedom from mexico.

  the story starts as sam huston(dennis quaid) sends  jim bowie( jason patric) to blow-up the alamo and bring back it's cannons. what huston doesn't know is that bowie has t.b. and is not going to live very long. as huston quaid is just the right part fighter, drinker, and statesmen. as bowie, jason patric is just fine , playing him as a man who knows he's dieing and just wants to die at home in san antoino were the alamo is.

patrick wilson is travis,the young hot head lt.col.in charge of the alamo and the one person no one likes. he playes the role fine and you come to understand and even like him once you get past his arogent mannor.

 the real star , besides the battle it's self is bily bob thornton as david ""davy"" crockett, a man tring to live down the legend that he himself helped put in place , so he can start over in texas. thornton is fantastic in the role of a man coming to grips with his real and legendary life in this most strange of places.

This is an excellent production. It makes any and all other movies about the subject laughable peices of Hollywood mythology. THIS film is more historically accurate than any of its predecessors.

Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Sam Houston is satisfactory, Jason Patric's Jim Bowie is excellent, and Patrick Wilson's portrayal of the young William Travis is outstanding. But my favorite of the film, by far, is Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of Davie Crockett. Thornton gives a very HUMAN face to the legendary American folk hero. ""If it were just me, David, here all by himself? I might scale these walls and take my chances. But, that Davie Crockett fellow.... everyone's watching HIM"". Greatest line in the movie.

As for the movie itself, it runs over 2 hours, but you don't detect it. Its pace is perfect, and there are no dragging spots. The action picks up immediately and never ceases. The movie does an excellent job of building-up to the final showdown at the mission. The final assault on the Alamo is absolutely incredible. First-rate cinematography through and through. Again, the most accurate depiction of the battle I have ever seen. Shot at the proper time of day (dark pre-dawn, and not mid-day!). The battle is over relatively quickly, as was the case. There may have been SOME exagerration with regards to the Mexican army's casualties. I'm not 100% sure.

There has always been a mystery surrounding the death of Davie Crockett. Did he die defending the Alamo? Was he captured? Did he beg for his life? All we have are the accounts of the Mexican witnesses to the battle, and some of those may be tainted. I believe the makers of this film got at least the part about his being captured right. Who can really say how things went after that?

The film ends with Sam Houston's masterful luring of Santa Ana into a ""Mexican Waterloo"" at San Jacinto.... and the complete rout of the Mexican army there, to the chorus of ""Remember The Alamo"". A defining moment in America's history.

This film did not do well at the box office. But that was no surprise. It was the kind of ""niche"" film that couldn't really expect to pull in big numbers. However, the box office returns did not indicate how good the film was/is. ""The Alamo"" goes down on my list of the best epic war films of all time.",1135728000,5,2525,4.6
2080315,2,B0002DRDCS,"Another retelling of one of America's most dramatic battles, The Alamo depicts the futile 13-day standoff in 1836 between a brave group of ""Texians"" and their Mexican adversaries at a small Spanish church in San Antonio.

Despite the odds against them, the Americans are willing to sacrifice their lives for land they have chosen to call home. Patrick Wilson stars as the impetuous Lieutenant-Colonel William Travis, who struggles for the respect of his volunteers. But, like the character he portrays, the unpolished Wilson is overshadowed by Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett and Jason Patric as Jim Bowie. Thornton's performance as the compassionate and multi-talented ""King of the Wild Frontier"" is expressive, while the infrequently seen Patric is intense as the typhoid-suffering famous knife-fighter -- both are humble, knowing they are not the legends they have been made out to be.

Together, these three men must stand up for their ideals against ruthless General Santa Anna (Emilio Echevarria), who views them as ""pirates"". Determined to preserve the integrity of the Mexican territory, he is confident in the strength of his massive army -- though seemingly all pomp and circumstance, they are a formidable force.

Yet, director (and co-writer) John Lee Hancock is unable to bring much fervour to the story; perhaps he was preoccupied with his upcoming rehash of King Arthur. The battle scenes, though interesting, do not make up for the bland screenplay, which frequently stalls to explore the life stories of the three principals...the banal dialogue is as dry as the dusty compound where the action takes place.

Like Pearl Harbor, an unnecessary postscript is tacked on to protect American pride, but this merely lessens the impact of the tragedy. Here we see General Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) leading the retaliatory battle and cry for Texas independence. As usual, the likeable but unaccomplished Quaid acts rather than lives his character -- he is as lifeless as the corpses surrounding the funereal fortress.

This version of The Alamo is not the epic it pretends to be. While the images of slaughter may unite some Americans against the terrorism that has affected their country, this film is only mildly inspiring. Unlike the actual event, it will not go down in history. Rating: 5 out of 10.",1135296000,8,2317,5.151595744680851
2080316,5,B0002DRDCS,"Yes, it's true. Some of this movie isn't completely historically accurate, but it's close enough. The details are so miniscule that only one who has an intense understanding of the Alamo and all of the events surrounding it would know the difference. I've taken 7th grade Texas history, I'm no idiot, and I thought this movie was perfectly decent historically. Some things had to be altered minorly for cinematic purposes, which shouldn't be critiqued with extensive scrutiny. Everything about this movie is nothing short of spectacular.

The acting- Amazing. Billy Bob Thornton was BORN to play David Crockett, and portrays it amazingly. I don't know why he wasn't nominated for an Academy Award, he did a marvelous job. Jason Patric, as Jim Bowie, also did a great job at portraying a mysterious enigma of history, which Jim Bowie without a doubt was. I was quite impressed by his performance. Patrick Wilson gives the second best performance in this movie, playing the fancy, dignified, yet courageous William Travis. Patrick Wilson isn't terribly famous, but he did amazing at this part. Some of the other, smaller roles had great actors too, like Jordi Molla playing Juan Seguin. The biggest letdown in this movie was Dennis Quaid. He was a TERRIBLE Sam Houston, absolutely abominable. He is generally a good actor, but he just...well, he just tried to hard in this movie. The gruff voice, the wanna-be intellectual statements, the fake fancy hairdo...none of it was good. I don't know why he was casted in this role. Other than him, the acting is exceptional.

The scenery is stellar as well. Everything is amazing, I just felt the need to elaborate on the acting the most.

Though most reviews proclaim this movie to be inaccurate and slow (though at times it is a bit slow), I still believe this movie to be the best interpretation of the incident at the Alamo yet, and probably ever. Check it out, it's well worth it.",1135209600,4,1926,4.865853658536586
2080317,4,B0002DRDCS,"I really enjoyed this movie. One of the main reasons... Billy Bob Thortons portrayl of Davey Crockett. The fact that they portrayed Crockett as a real man with real vunerabilities who was a politician, storyteller, good old boy, and man of real emotion, intelligence and depth was just fantastic. Jason Patrick was also very good as Jim Bowie. Another thing that was really good about the movie is that they followed both the Texans accounts of what happened as well as letters written by Mexican soldiers to get a more real and accurate account of what really happened.

2080319,2,B0002DRDCS,"Quite frankly, this film dragged for me! There was a definite lack of human interest to engross me as a viewer.  I did not find the characters portrayed lively, sympathetic, loathful or above all else, interesting.  Watching the film, I didn't even feel tension as the story reached it's action and very dark (in light terms that is) climax.

This criticism would be somewhat unfair if the movie portrayed a very accurate representation of the facts, but it does not: for example, Crockett is not known as dying the way he did in the film -a certain artistic license has most certainly been used.  But then the question is begged, if artistic license was used, why could not the film have been made more engrossing -and with a more human spin?

All the major character flaws of the lead participants are glossed over as though you are reading them out of a page of a book (not paying debts, leaving a wife, etc) with no real digging into the possible causes or reasons for behaviour.  Even the aspect of slavery was weakly washed over with little more than enough time to give a few lines to the actors who played the slaves.

What about the fact that Texas was legally Mexican territory?  What was the perspective of the slaves?  What about those defenders who did have doubts? What was the motivation of the Mexicans who took up arms against Santa Anna? (and please not an in depth analysis such as ""enemies of my enemies are my friends"" either) What about the Mexican side's perspective on this?

I feel as if this could have been a terrific historical story, but instead turned out to be a stodgy anaemic rendering.  I feel it could have explored much more -even in a fairly accurate historical context -but failed to grasp the opportunity when so many interesting historical perspectives were there for the taking.

2080320,3,B0002DRDCS,"This film was panned by reviewers when it came out, but I'd have to say that it presents a grittier look at the events surrounding the Alamo than have previously represented on screen.  The characters were interesting, although it seems that they may have been exaggerated a bit to emphasize their actual position during the events that they underwent.

The ""making of"" and other extras on this DVD were an excellent addition to help put context behind the events that surrounded this place and time and why (or why not) the characters represented were extraordinary in their own right.

Definitely worth seeing it once with all of the extras all the way through.  The pacing is spotty at best in that the anticipation of waiting for the final battle isn't always felt by the audience.",1126828800,3,785,4.792592592592593

Well, despite my rather silly reason for renting it, I must say that ""The Alamo"" delivers. I also must admit that I have a bit of a prejudice against films of this type. Still, with John Lee Hancock at the helm I knew that it would at least look impressive. Best of all, ""The Alamo"" is a powerful film about bravery in battle and courage in the face of certain death. Apparently there was a switch of directors at some point, I don't know who the other contender was, but I am grateful that the studio didn't hand the reins to Michael Bay so that he would make another ""Pearl Harbor"".....",1126742400,2,862,4.294478527607362

It is certainly not a great film; not even a very good film, but it is far from a disaster. It boasts the most intelligent and sensitive portrayal of David Crockett on record along with fine portrayals of Santa Anna and General Castrillon; there is good attention to much of the detail and the appearance of the Texians in civilian topcoats etc. but someone seems to have butchered it in order to reduce the running time, if you check with the 'book of the film' and it's a pity.

2080324,3,B0002DRDCS,"Of the many praising this movie, one constant in their reviews seems to be a defense of the historical accuracy over previous cinematic adaptations.  Allow me to submit up front to the merits of the film's accuracy, while at the same time dispute it's overall merits.  ""The Alamo"", despite it's good intentions, falls into the trap of putting all it's energy into the historical accuracy at the expense of all else, including engaging storytelling.  Naturally, 90% of historical epics coming out of Hollywood take significant liberties with the facts, but it seems it's this severe dichotomy which misleads filmmakers like John Lee Hancock into believing they can get by on just the facts.

The acting (with the exception perhaps of Dennis Quaid) had been almost universally praised, and there really isn't anything to complain about in that department, but neither does the austere, virtually blow-by-blow script allow any of the participants to really run away with their parts.  There is also a certain staginess to the scenes which wasn't present in the John Wayne version, despite the fact that both had to deal with taking place almost entirely behind the walls of an ad hoc fortress.  Again, it feels like in placing so much emphasis on accuracy, there isn't any room left over for dynamic storytelling.  After a time, the almost complete lack of overt emotion becomes almost disturbing;  Texans have always been known for their fiery stubbornness, but little is shown of the fire beneath the characters of the Alamo defendants, even during the speech where Travis attempts to persuade the Texans to stay.  There is also little dynamism in the relationship between Travis and Bowie, the latter of whom brought his own quite capable men and refused to serve under Travis, only acquiescing when he became too ill to command even his own troops.

Overall, the characters in this film go through the motions as if every step has been pre-ordained and they are merely carrying out their destiny;  in other words, it's more like we're watching actors re-enact the battle for the Alamo rather than watching the historical battle itself.  Those who would point out that we are in fact watching actors re-enact the battle miss the whole point of what movies are supposed to be about.

The sole exception to the extreme subtlety in characterizations is Dennis Quaid as Sam Houston.  Quaid's part was allegedly cut significantly in the editing room, and it wouldn't surprise me at all if it was his blusterry overacting that led to this decision.  Though Houston was a known alcoholic, he was also a smart, tactical mind who was capable of keeping his cool under the most hostile of counsel, yet Quaid plays him as a near-madman always on the edge of a convulsive emotional fit.  His performance here has about as much subtlety as the one in ""Enemy Mine"" 20 years ago, which is to say: not much.  Dennis Quaid has always fared best in the kind of roles that Kevin Costner has popularized, those being simple, salt-of-the-earth type men who are forced to confront important yet black-and-white decisions.  None of this describes the character of Sam Houston, which is likely why Quaid has a hard time wrapping his chops around the role.

In closing, I'd like to mention an old acquaintance of mine, who would always read books - mostly fiction - and then watch the movie adaptations with a fine tooth comb.  He seemed more interested in picking out details that the film had either gotten wrong or just omitted than he did in judging the movie of a piece in and of itself.  I mention this friend because this is the type of person most likely to enjoy the Alamo - the detailists, rather than those who are primarily concerned with the big picture.",1124064000,9,3742,4.843014128728415
2080325,5,B0002DRDCS,"The Alamo has gotten a lot of bad rap, but it's really quite a good movie. Although, it may not be as wonderful as I say it is, especially if you're not a Native Texan. However, this is still a wonderful film.

:::ACTING:::

William B. Travis: Well, despite what everyone else says, I think that Patrcik Wilson, of Oklahoma! fame, does a wonderful job as William B. Travis, and he plays well against Jason Patric (Jim Bowie). Wilson certainly makes a more interesting character out of Travis, and also a more attractive one.

Davy Crockett: Billy Bob Thornton makes a wonderful Davy Crockett! He certainly helps to hold the movie together, and adds a few comical moments. His preformance is definatly worth an Oscar-Nomination.

Jim Bowie: Jason Patric is possibly the worst actor out of the four main characters. However, he still pulls off the role quite well. After all, there isn't much you can do with a role that requires you to be bed-ridden a good 3/4 of the movie.

Sam Houston: Of course, he's Dennis Quaid! Do you really think I'd have something bad to say about Dennis Quaid? He is an amazing actor, and the role of Sam Houston suited him well.

:::DIRECTION:::

To put it bluntly, the direction sucked. Ron Howard would have done a much better job, enough said.

:::VISUALS:::

Very pleasing visuals on this one, indeed. Despite the small budget, they managed to pull off a few good special effects. Well done.

2080326,5,B0002DRDCS,"I over the years have developed an interest in the Alamo. I guess it stems from when I was a boy and actually visited the Alamo.
Over the years I watched the John Wayne version, that was released in 1960. Although very entertaining, I found his accout to be pure Hollywood. More entertainment than fact. I also found the Disney version of this film to be fun but again not historically correct.
We will probably never know if Travis drew the line in dirt with his sword or not.
This new version of the Alamo attempts to show Santa Ana and the defenders of the Alamo  as they really were.
Its shows how Crockett was in many ways trapped by his legand. The movie even goes so far as to speculate he might have tried to escape if he could have. It also makes you think he would have wanted to fight out in the open instead of being pinned down in a broken down mission.
Its shows how barbaric Santa Ana really was and how he executed prisoners under a white flag of truce. When prisoners were killed they were bayonetted and then shot to make sure they were dead.
The movie does not begin at the Alamo nor does it stop after the battle. It attempts to not only show the defenders of the Alamo, but it also shows what is happening with Sam Houston in his effort to defeat Santa Ana and claim Texas.
There is always the controversy over how Crockett was killed and I Guess there always will be. Whether executed or not his legand remains in my mind. Captain Dickinson's wife as she was leaving the Alamo claims he was lying dead near the short fence that he and his Tennesseians were ordered to defend. Personally I have a hard time listening to accounts by soldiers who were barbarians and certainly were not gallant.
This is certainly the most historical version of the Alamo ever made. I can see where some flaws may be, but then again, we will never know the full account of what really happened there.",1120003200,4,1901,4.354929577464789
2080327,3,B0002DRDCS,"I have been an ""Alamo fanatic"" for about 4 decades now, so naturally I was bound to like the film.  I was also bound to be slightly disappointed, given how much I looked forward to this film.  There's almost enough reviews here for every defender of the Alamo, but one more won't hurt.

Billy Bob Thornton is far and away the main strength of the film, in terms of entertainment.  It is hard to imagine anyone ever doing a better Crockett.  I didn't care much for Wilson as Travis at first (too hesitant, not forceful enough) but his performance has grown on me.  The worst casting is Emilio Echevarria as Santa Anna.  He's way too old and uncharismatic to depict the ""generalissimo"" circa 1836, and his mannerisms at times seem goofy rather than forceful or cruel.

The main flaw is that there is not enough character development of the defenders (other than Crockett, Travis, and Bowie).  This is partly because the film tries to cover the whole Texan War of Independence rather than focusing more on the Alamo itself.  This is one of the few aspects in which the old John Wayne version actually made a better choice:  Sam Houston should be a cameo role.  You don't need to show San Jacinto (maybe just a captioned ""what happened after"" segment).

The defenders of the Alamo not only are not developed as characters, but they are not depicted very sympathetically.  They come across (in the apt words of one of the Tejano defenders) as a bunch of ""low lifes.""  Most of them are too old too.  We Alamo fanatics know who Bonham, Autry, etc. were, but the general audience needed a chance to get to know them better.

Uniforms, costumes, weapons, etc. are mostly great, despite some very minor quibbles in other reviews.  (One odd ""accuracy"" flaw in the Alamo set is that the faces of the Chapel and Long Barracks are almost flush -- space limitations).

As I teach my students, when it comes to Hollywood depictions of history, don't expect complete accuracy.  The best outcome in the view of historians (like myself) is that a good, entertaining film will get people interested in the subject, and they will read more about it.  This newest Alamo failed here, I'm afraid:  it tries so hard to be authentic that it didn't connect with a larger audience.  It is still a ""must see, must own"" DVD for Alamo fanatics and history buffs, so I do absolutely recommend it for that audience.",1119916800,11,2382,4.6324582338902145
2080328,4,B0002DRDCS,"I am one of the many who waited for the release of this film (one suffering from internal politics of a studio underseige from without and within).  The only thing that the film suffers from is the studio.  The production itself is sterling, the acting more than above average.  In the case of Billy Bob Thornton's interpretation of David Crockett, momumental.

As a movie it is an interpretive piece but I think captures a situation where men who represented all complexities of life faced a situation that required they stand above self interest.  I think the film captures this.  While it held back on excess gore, the battle was shown as a cruel event, the fort as being unglamourous and the question as to why, as some points, individuals choose to be heroic, still an unanswered mystery.

This is a very good file which I hope its supporters will grow each year.",1119225600,6,868,4.671052631578948
2080329,5,B0002DRDCS,"2004's The Alamo is one of the most undeserved flops of recent years (and possibly inflation-adjusted as big a disaster as Heaven's Gate). Bad timing may account or some of it, as America's image went from besieged victims to bloody aggressors (certainly it was barely even released outside the US), but the film's sombre, mournful tone is probably more to blame - beginning with the dead bodies of the defeated defenders, there's a sadness and inevitability to the film that's the complete antithesis of the feelgood destruction-and-revenge of Pearl Harbor. Even Carter Burwell's haunting low-key score is more a lament than the broad action scoring you might expect. The script is well crafted, the characterisation surprisingly strong and the comparative absence of cgi pays dividends with a level of verisimilitude that's been lacking from most recent epics.

It also benefits from an extraordinary performance from Billy Bob Thornton as Davey (""He prefers David"") Crockett, a crowd-pleaser faced with having to live up to his own legend, and blessed with the film's best dialogue and it's best scene as he silences the Mexican guns with his fiddle. Thornton owns the film in a way I haven't seen from any actor for a long, long time. He's definitely the heart and soul of the movie.

Thankfully, it's not quite a one-man show. Patrick Wilson does surprisingly well as Travis, Jason Patric's tediously one-note surliness is for once put to effective use as Bowie and the supporting cast is filled with great faces, all caught wonderfully by Dean Semler's superb cinematography. Only Dennis Quaid fares less well as Houston, failing to make much of his admittedly limited opportunities.

True it falters somewhat after the fall of the Alamo, but it's still an impressive, intelligent and sometimes quietly moving epic that didn't deserve its fate at the box-office.",1119052800,2,1868,5.1381578947368425
2080330,5,B0002DRDCS,"The Alamo is a fine historical movie and it's also a fine dramatic movie.  I'm actually an American historian, and although I specialize in the American Revolution, the Alamo has always held a special interest for me, ever since I first saw Fess Parker as Davy Crocket.  That version of the Alamo is the idealized version.  I love it.  The John Wayne version I hated.  This version is as close to historically accurate as possible.  While some dramatic license is taken, I think the fact that John Lee Hancock focussed on a more character driven rather than action driven movie is too his credit.  There are some great characterizations including Billy Bob Thornton as David Crockett, Dennis Quaid's Sam Houston, Patrick Wilson as William Travis and Jason Patric as Jim Bowie.  The actor's take great pride in their work and the attention to historical detail is astonishing.  This movie is about more than just the Alamo.  It is about the entire war of Texas liberation, concluding with the capture of Santa Anna at San Jacinto.  This is an astonishing movie and is very well done.

2080331,1,B0002DRDCS,"Being a Texan, and enjoying Texas history, I figured I would find something to enjoy in this movie. Was I wrong!

The Alamo is a total piece of boring Hollywierd junk from start to finish. It's sure easy to see why Disney lost over $150 million on this piece of garbage. What a total disaster and waste of effort.

When Director John Hancock, had Sam Houston (Denis Quaid) on a solid white horse for the Battle of San Jacinto scene I about threw up. The idiot made Houston look like The Lone Ranger, ugg. Also very obvious the screenwriter and director didn't spend any time at the San Jacinto Museum of History, getting there facts straight for this movie.

The Alamo was a hard movie to make even with a great director, much less with an obvious amateur. Disney should have never replaced Ron Howard as Director. Maybe the movie would have then had a chance at the box office.",1115856000,8,878,4.475
2080332,4,B0002DRDCS,"After reading many of the other reviews I think a bit of background is in order. Mexico achieved its independence from Spain and set up a Republic and elected its first President. This man served out his term and then Antonio de Lopez Santa Ana was elected President. He then threw out the constitition and the elected government and declared himself absolute ruler of Mexico.

 A policy of encouraging immigration was established by Spain and continued by the new nation of Mexico. If a settler would convert to Catholicism they would be granted Mexican citizenship and be allowed to own land and start businesses. In this way Mexico hoped to attract entrepreneurs, business people, and money to the Provinces. James Bowie, for example, was a Mexican citizen when he died at the Alamo.

 By throwing out the constitution and siezing power Santa Ana provoked widespread opposition to his rule. The defenders of the Alamo wanted to restore the constitutional government of 1824. That is why the flag that flew over the Alamo was a Mexican flag with the date 1824 emblazoned on it.

 The movie production was troubled from the start with Ron Howard turning over the directors chair to John Lee Hancock who wrote the script. A magnificent set was built for this movie that exactly replicated the Alamo and San Antonio De Bexar. John Wayne did the same thing for his version of the Alamo and built his set in Brackettville, Texas. This the town where I am from and as a young man I was able to watch the construction of this set and the work on the film, a great experience for me at that time. The location people from the new movie visited the Wayne set and studied it for possible use but eventally rejected it as they felt that they surrounding terrain was not enough like San Antonio so they built their new set outside of Austin. They may have come to regret this as bad weather, torrential rain, and even snow plagued the production and caused significant delay.

 The movie was beautifully photographed and more than 100 hours of film was shot. This large amount of film contributed to delays in the editing process.

 I think that the cast was quite good and that the work by Patrick Wilson and Billy Bob Thornton was outstanding. The actor who played Santa Ana, Emilio Echevarra, was positively brilliant and he should have had an Oscar for best supporting actor.

 The costuming was excellent but the battle scenes could have been a bit better.

 Many of the men who died in the Alamo were in fact locals who had families and businesses in the area. One fact overlooked in the movie was that the settlers already had their hands full with marauding Indians and bandits and it was a hard decision for these people to leave their homes to defend the Alamo. Most of these were Anglos who were Mexican citizens. The 33 men who rode in from Gonzales all left behind families and most knew that they would not return.

 Originally the Alamo was garrisoned by Mexican Army troops who were driven out by the locals. When they returned to Mexico proper Santa Ana was so enraged that he marched immediately upon the Alamo, losing many of his soldiers in the forced winter march. This was accurately portrayed in the movie. The Texans were taken by surprise when the Mexican Army showed up in the early spring before defensive preparations were complete. The actor that played Col. Neale, the Alamo commander before Travis, commented ""........as you can see it was not designed with miltary intentions in mind.""

 One scene that really sticks out is when Crockett, sitting with other defenders around an evening campfire, describes his Indian fighting days and tells the story of the potatoes that he ate that were soaked in grease from burned human beings (the Indians).

 Another good scene is when Crockett mounts the wall and plays fiddle along with the Mexican Army Band as they play the Death Song, ""Deguello.""

 The movie carries through to the Battle of San Jacinto where Santa Ana is defeated and forced to cede Texas.

 Between the 200 or so defenders at the Alamo and the 400 prisoners shot down like dogs at Goliad a lot of Texan lives were lost, especially considering the relatively small population. There was much grief and sorrow after it was all over.

 A must have for those interested in Alamo lore.

 All in all this was a very good film that could have been a great film. Worth the price.",1114905600,14,4406,4.679636835278859
2080333,1,B0002DRDCS,"So, I really didn't like this film at all.  I know that seems like there is nothing that I like lately, but for some very strange reason the quality of pictures seem to be diminishing rapidly.  As I attempt to watch as much as I can from the video store wall, I cannot help but discover the poor nature of nearly everything Hollywood is releasing.  The Alamo is no different.  Here we have a group of men lost in a production befuddled film that would rather have the perfect ""visionary"" shot instead of actually telling a decent story.  Creativity and originality seem to play second fiddle (pun is intended) to safe moments where our director could easily say ""historically correct"" instead of showing us any ounce of the truth.  There had to be some darkness in that bottomless pit known as the Alamo, yet Hancock didn't seem to focus on that at all.  I cannot help but wonder what type of film this would have been for Ron Howard and Russell Crowe to complete.  Literally, this film felt like a second-hand thrift store.  ""B"" actors filling in for table scraped parts that Crowe and Howard didn't want.  Jason Patric, Patrick Wilson, Dennis Quaid, and Billy Bob just didn't seem to fit the mold that I was hoping to see.  They did not accurately portray the ""Wild West"" as I was hoping to see.  Instead, I felt I was watching this glorified account of death done by pretty actors that would give the ladies a reason to go to the theater.

Perhaps I am a bit to bitter about this film.  I know that I should only dwell on the positive, but as each film progresses with poor results, it is hard to even see the positive.  In fact, after the several films I have just watched I am nearly to the point of saying that Hollywood has gone completely to the dark side.  I understand that his was a historical picture, but does that mean that creativity and originality are thrown out the window and into oncoming traffic?  I would hope not, but apparently Hancock had other thoughts.  From watching the special features of this film in which Hancock talks about the production of this film, he focuses so less on the actors performances and more on the actual set that you can only calculate why there was less attention to the actors and more on the scenery with the final product.  As I watched the glorious overhead shots, the wondrous cannonball pan-through, and several other fantastical war scenes, I couldn't help but think to myself on how this should have been a story about people, not places.  I do not think that Hancock accomplished this, or ... really from the looks of it ... tried.

With a central focus on the scenery and less on the acting, this creates a level of acceptable mediocrity with our actors.  Honestly, there wasn't one that stood out in the crowd as a ""riveting"" performance.  Each did their parts, brought some historical honesty to their lines, but overall it was Billy Bob being Billy Bob playing Davie Crockett and Jason Patric being Jason Patric playing Jim Bowie.  I don't know if this makes sense or not, but I could not see these actors in their corresponding roles.  I half-expected Dennis Quaid to come out of the forest at the end, ripping his shirt off, and pulling a Last of the Mohicans right there in front of God and his country ... but he did not.  In fact, he really didn't do anything except utter fragmented sentences from his dialogue that created this smart aura around him, when actually it was nothing more than Dennis Quaid being Dennis Quaid playing Mr. Houston.  It was, to use a favorite word of mind, pathetic.  I couldn't get the actors out of my mind.  I couldn't see them in their respective roles, and this hurt the film.  Directors have to realize that big names do not equal big film.  Smaller, independent names could have carried this film on their shoulders better than these veterans did.  Again, I cannot ponder enough about what the dynamics of this film would have been like if Randy Quaid were to jump aboard.  Has the two brothers done anything together?  I think The Alamo would have been a grand beginning.

Overall, this feature did not impress me.  I know it bombed horribly at the box office, and now I can see why.  There was nothing of value throughout the entire picture.  From the uninsightful acting, the glamorized vision of war, and even the complete lack of structure (needing to focus more on man instead of nature), The Alamo proved that big budget can ruin a good history lesson.  Sadly, I am not sure what could have saved this picture outside of a complete gutting.  Have you ever walked into a room in which the walls were so moldy that you knew that you were going to have to rip them down to build a solid frame?  Well, that was the feeling behind The Alamo.  The walls to this picture were moldy and completely unstable leading to a flimsy frame.  If only more time would have been spent working on the important elements instead of the ""Hollywood"" moments, this may have done a bit better.  Until that time arrives, I do not recommend this film to anyone, especially those with any sort of passion for our nation's history.  I do believe it would cause mass professor spitting and a rebirth of the duel.

2080334,4,B0002DRDCS,"This blockbuster failer is surprisingly good- after watching in it I felt a new sense of pride in America and the heroics of everyday citizens. I'm not biased mind you I grew up in the North and moved the South when I was a teen. This film delievers epic battle scenes, a good dialouge, and great performances. Orignally renting this I thought it would be boring to watch given the fact you know the outcome of the battle- the Alamo falls killing all the men inside but- to my surprise it was very interesting.

The Alamo shows heroics from ordinary men. Although showcasing some performances from extraordinary men including Davey Crockett who fell at the Alamo. Delievering such patriotic and strirring lines as ""Victory or death"" and ""Remember the Alamo!"" which became the battle cry after the masacree. The movie shows off the actions of the Alamo before, after, and during the fight. I understood a new sense of hopelessness as I looked over the Alamo wall to see that huge Mexican army suddenly you could tell their is NO escape. Also, hopeless as Sam Houston makes the decision not to send more troops to the men inside ""I'm not willing to sacrifice Texas"" despite people in the background saying ""it's the right thing to do.""

Billy Bob Thorton gives the performance of his career as David Crockett who has more than a lot to live up to when it comes to celebrity. My favorite part of the movie is when Davey got caputered by the Mexicans at the Alamo- Santa Ana asking Crockett to beg for his life instead Crockett says ""You let me go, I'll talk to Mr. Sam Houston and make sure your fellers don't die... I'll do my best I'm not making any promises seeing how you've made things awfully frosty."" Patrick Wilson also does a good job as the newbie colonel perhaps, since it was his big acting debut he could relate a lot. Dennis Quaid does a good job as the revenge seeking Sam Houston and made us Texans proud.

2080335,2,B0002DRDCS,"I am ussually a great fan of epic films. With those larger than life characters, larger than life battles and larger than life stories. But I am afraid this film is not a larger than life film. Apart from the historical accuracy, which I think is quite fine, (considering that there is only one point of view), this film is terribly boring. And not because there were not happening things all the time, but because it seems that the stories told have not been put together.

We have the story of the Americans in El Alamo, the story of the Mexicans and the story of Sam Houston. But never, not for  a minute those stories seem to be part of a bigger one. It seems like they were doing three films and simply put together the parts.

About the cast I think that Billy Bob Thorton is the only one who can be considering as acting in the film. His David Crockett is rather nice although it seems quite difficult to see him as a great hero, but at least is the only one who shows certain human aspects. But that only is not enough to make a good film. Dennis Quaid as Houston only appears, really, after the fall of El Alamo, right before the battle of San Jacinto, but that is not enough to make me believe that Houston was such a great leader.

The characters played by Jason Patric and Patrick Wilson are completely forgetable. I do not know if they were really like that, but if they were , well, that siege for thirteen days was a joke.

I was really disappointed by this film, because it had not spirit and not passion. And considering that Texans has this particular battle into their personal mythology I am afraid they must be quite disappointed too. This film has told me nothing about Texas, Mexico or the lives of people who lived there. Nothing about the changes in the frontier between Mexico and the United States, what other people in the USA thought about that  adventure  in Texas.

In the early part of the Nineteenth Century, the area now known as the state of Texas was the scene of a massive tug-of-war between the Mexicans, who claimed ownership of the land, and the Americans who were determined to gain independence for the territory so that it could one day be subsumed into the new, ever expanding nation to the north.  The 1836 siege of the Alamo played a crucial role in determining the outcome of that struggle.  For it was here that a group of 187 Texans chose to make their stand against over 3,000 Mexican troops led by the famed Santa Anna - and lost their lives in the process.  This turned out to be a short-lived, pyrrhic victory for the Mexicans, however, for the totality and brutality of the slaughter so outraged the Texans that the phrase ""Remember the Alamo!"" quickly became the official rallying cry for Texas independence, which was won soon after.

""The Alamo""'s all-star cast includes Patrick Wilson as William Travis, the Lieutenant Colonel who led the American forces; Jason Patric as James Bowie, the consumptive knife-fighter and leader of the Texas militia; Billy Bob Thornton as Davey Crocket, the legendary Indian-fighter-turned-United-States-senator; and Dennis Quaid as General Sam Houston, who chose to sit out the siege but who managed to extract swift and total revenge against Santa Anna and the Mexican army a very short time later.

The film is most effective when it deals with the history surrounding the event, even though a number of historians have raised serious objections as to the veracity of much of what is shown on screen.  Still, when virtually every single person is dead at the end of a battle, it is a little difficult to come up with the primary source, eyewitness testimony one would need to compile a reliable historical account of the incident.  Speculation is obviously going to play a very large part in any dramatic recreation of the event, so I think the moviemakers can be given some slack in this area.  However, it is as dramas that such movies are judged, and here ""The Alamo"" doesn't score nearly so well.  Admirably, it has attempted to see its larger-than-life characters in relatively life-sized terms, but in its attempt at humanizing the participants, it often winds up sentimentalizing them instead.  Crockett, in particular, falls victim to this problem.  So obsessed is he with playing down the near-mythological, iconic status his previous exploits have garnered for him, that he becomes little more than a simpering revisionist bore in the process.

""The Alamo"" also suffers from a malady common to films based on well known historical events: that of knowing the end of the story going into the movie.  It leads to an even more serious problem here than it did in, say, ""Titanic,"" because, at least in that film, even though we knew beforehand that the ship was going to sink, at least we didn't know exactly which characters were going to go to their watery graves with her.  In the case of ""The Alamo,"" all we can do is wait for the final battle to commence and watch as each of the characters suffers a common fate.

Because the majority of the film's 137-minute running time is taken up with the 13-day-long siege and standoff, the pacing often leans towards the desultory and the languid.  Most of the time is spent with the characters sitting around and waiting for help to arrive, not exactly a scenario designed to provide edge-of-the-seat excitement for the viewer.  Most of the acting is wooden and stiff, although Thornton brings a few nice touches to his portrayal of Crockett, even if his golly-gee-aren't-I-just-like-everyone-else boyishness begins to wear a mite thin after awhile.  There's also an undercurrent of xenophobia running through the film in its one-sided portrayal of the opposing forces.  Santa Anna, in particular, is reduced to the level of a stock villain, stopping just short of twirling his (admittedly nonexistent) moustache at moments of extreme dastardliness.  Needless to say, there's been very little attempt to humanize him.

The actual climactic assault on the Alamo has been impressively mounted, although we are strangely unmoved by all the deaths we see happening before us.  Interestingly, it is only in a different scene - the one in which Houston's army chases some fleeing Mexican soldiers into a river, brutally and senselessly slaughtering them in the process - that the filmmakers capture the ugliness and madness of war.  More scenes like that might have made ""The Alamo"" less of a total rout for the audience than the Alamo was for those involved in the real thing.",1112486400,8,4626,4.931701030927835
2080337,5,B0002DRDCS,"It's 1836. Texas is still officially part of Mexico, but after Gen. Antonio Lpez de Santa Anna seizes power and declares himself dictator for life, many Texians, as they call themselves, want to break away to form their own republic. Santa Anna leads a large force into Texas to put down the rebellion, and he heads for Bexar d San Antonio, where he knows the rebels have a large cache of weapons and cannons.

The hard-drinking Gen. Sam Houston, appointed head of the Texian militia, sends Lt. Col William Travis and a group of volunteers to retrieve the cannons or, if necessary, defend the town. Assorted hangers-on accompany Travis, including the legendary Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie. (Famous for his knife-fighting abilities, Bowie's ""knife"" can more properly be called a small sword.)

Travis is a bit of a martinet, and the volunteers would rather answer to one of their own, Jim Bowie. When the time comes, however, Travis steps up, takes command and rallies the men. Crockett wryly feels himself a victim of his own legend and is compelled to live out what everyone expects of him. (That legend leads to some comical moments when a group of Mexicans refuses to attack for fear of Crockett, who supposedly can kill mountain lions with his bare hands and leap across the Mississippi River.)

Thus the stage is set for the famous showdown at the redoubt called the Alamo. The 190 or so defenders refuse to surrender and hold off the Mexican forces for 13 days. Calls for reinforcements bring only a handful of men. Santa Anna, an arrogant, strutting peacock, is determined to wipe them off the earth to set an example to other rebels. After great bloodshed, he succeeds on March 6, 1836. But in short order he falls victim to his own conceit at the Battle of San Jacinto, where the Texians, under the canny leadership of Houston, ""remember the Alamo"" and defeat the Mexican army. This is a very good movie that I think almost anyone can enjoy!",1111708800,3,1950,4.729411764705882

It's also nothing short of tragic that a movie that animates such a heroic page in American history would flop so miserably.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this movie - not only is it an important film for all Americans to see, but it also happens to be extremely engaging just as a piece of good entertainment. Many people I think shy away from it because they know what happened at the Alamo, and think that it can't have a happy ending. However, the film also depicts the events that followed The Alamo, revealing that the sacrifice of those brave men is what afforded Sam Houston the time to muster a force strong enough to defeat Santa Anna at San Jacinto, and liberate the great state of Texas.",1111276800,2,882,4.540880503144654
2080339,2,B0002DRDCS,"This is a bit hard to review or judge, since I have NO interest whatsoever in Texas or the Alamo, or Crocket...well, in fact, anything to do with any of the above. The whole subject bores me to tears, and I only rented this movie because I had rented everything else already. So what can I say? The movie wasn't super boring, but it didn't really stir any emotions or thoughts, either. Seemed WAY too sentimental, too preachy and speechy, and a lot of the time I rolled my eyes when someone said something so ""scripted"" and false. ""Yeah right, like they said that."" Or ""Yeah right, like they really did that.""

On a different level, the movie seemed ill-timed. It's trying to muster this ""we're underdogs"" theme, as if America is outgunned and outmanned, but dadgummit, we're gonna fight till the end because we're Americans! Yeah, doesn't really swing in this day and age, when we're the top dogs and everyone ELSE is using their ""we're the underdogs"" diatribe against America. I don't know, that's just what I was thinking. Eh, maybe I'd have liked the movie better if I was a Texan.",1111104000,4,1085,4.592783505154639
2080340,5,B0002DRDCS,"How this movie got so bad reviews is beyond me. Apparently everyone who didn't enjoy the film doesn't like the story of the Alamo. The film is pretty much historically acurate. From what I know of the main characters of the film, they are definately portrayed well by Billy Bob Thorton, Dennis Quaid, and Jason Patric.  The Alamo has the qualities of old epic films from the 50's and 60's, which is a great thing to see in the new century. I think another thing that really makes it so great is that Davy Crockett isn't the main character. Unlike all the other older films based on the Alamo. It's split between Crockett, Bowie, Houston, and Travis.  Quaid makes a great Sam Houston, acts kinda crazy in a suttle way.  Patric does awesome job as Bowie, sorta mysterious in a way, with a past that is not quite clear in the film.  Thorton as Crockett, acting as if he really doesn't like living up to his legend, but does anyways. It's a shame this film didn't do that well, cause it deserves all the acclaim as other films with 100 million+ box office success. If you're expecting a western, it is not.  One of the main problems I've had with other films on the Alamo.  They tried to hard to be a western film. The Alamo is a peroid piece about soldiers coming to terms with the inevitable, they are all alone and must fight for what they believe in. Texas.",1111104000,2,1357,4.386454183266932
2080341,3,B0002DRDCS,"Despite scathing reviews, this is not a bad movie. Thornton's Crockett is an interesting take on the man. The action is acceptable except for the final defeat of Santa Anna, which was poorly done. Worth a slow evening.",1109548800,2,218,4.7631578947368425
2080342,4,B0002DRDCS,"I do not understand why this movie failed at the box office or why so many critics ravaged it, while others, such as Ebert and Roper, gave it two thumbs up! It is a well-written, far more accurate portrayal of these heroes and this moment in history than previously depicted, and the acting, especially that of Billy Bob Thornton and Jason Patric,was very good. I have liked this film even more on subsequent viewings.",1108944000,3,418,4.662162162162162

2080344,4,B0002DRDCS,"The Alamo is not a great movie, but it is a very good one. I disagree with most of the critics on this point, most of whom panned the film (except for Roger Ebert, who said that critics disliked the film simply because it was good). The movie does more than simply tell the tale of the Alamo itself; it fits the incident into the larger picture of Texas history, and it does so without being long-winded. As with any good movie, the strength is in the characters. This is seen primarily in Billy Bob Thornton's Davy Crockett, who carries the weight of playing a living legend well, accompanied by all the difficulties that status can bring to a man. The battle itself seemed rather short, but Hancock succeeds in doing the one difficult thing about shooting a battle scene: communicating clearly what is happening in the chaos. Hancock also manages to avoid the sentimentality that often accompanies a story where men resign themselves to die, and doesn't fall into the trap of painting them with a twentieth century brush. The emotional punch of the main characters' deaths is not as potent as in, say, Saving Private Ryan, but the tragic and heroic stories of those who fought at the Alamo have never been told better.",1108771200,5,1220,4.652777777777778
2080345,5,B0002DRDCS,This version of the Alamo comes closest to accurately portraying what happened in 1836.  Billy Bob brings a lot of flair to his realistic portrayal of  Col. Davy Crockett. Jason Patric is just as good with his role as Col.  Sam Bowie. Patrick Wilson and Dennis Quaid are good but not outstanding in their roles as Lt. Col William Travis and Gen. Sam Houston. The film accurately includes Mexicans fighting on the side of the Texans and how  Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana's(potrayed by Emilio Echevarria) authoritarian methods led to the bloody takeover of the Alamo and the defeat and the capture of his army at San Jacquinto.,1108425600,2,628,4.73394495412844
2080346,2,B0002DRDCS,"This movie seems to have been made for no other purpose but to show that it is good for America to start wars.

On the plus side, the acting is excellent all around with particular kudos to Billy Bob Thornton and Jason Patric doing one of the few roles that I have actually liked him in. The two star rating is for the acting, a few decent scenes and a couple interesting visual effects.

Past that, the rest of the movie really is an insult to ones intelligence. The historical aspects of the movie are distorted, the plot is ridiculous, the characters don't always work, the visual effects are mostly nothing special and it seems that every effort is made to point out that the people who made it have never actually seen a good movie (by using wonderful film techniques like having the bad guys look directly into the camera while they address each other but pointing out to anyone that they are really talking right to the audience).

If you want a better western then get Blazing Saddles.

2080347,4,B0002DRDCS,"Historically, we tend to infuse  a little drama in all of our ""event-catastrophes"" don't we? Whether it's Custer or the Alamo, we tend to know what happened, but why and how and what the participants thought at the time often is shrouded in mystery. Maybe it's better that way.

What is impressive about the Alamo as an historical occurence is that like so many other tragedies it is this force that coelesces men and women to rally around the flag. Whether it's Custer or a High School fooball game, we rally around wrongs with righteous indignation. And often as Americans, with harsh consequences. So ""Remember the Alamo"" really is the clarion call that makes a state, creates a new nation and has men and women of differing visions put aside those views and join together.

Billy Bob Thornton is great as the bemused Davy Crockett. Jason Patric also as Jim Bowie, riddled with drink and illness. The final scene of Colonel Bowie, barely conscious, facing off the aggresors from a bed from which he can't arise, was particularly well done. It was a great deal like the Richard Widmark portrayal, 40 years earlier.

The subtlety with which we come to realize that these men and women weren't necessarily the ones you want to bring home to mother, was also well done. I sensed as in most great conflicts, they found themselves in a place not of their choosing, kind of frustrated by that, kind of resentful of that, but willing to make the best of it. If you recall that extraordinary expression on the face of another great, Steve McQueen in ""The Sand Pebbles,"" it was like that. 'I guess the time has come and I wish I could tell you how I got here.'

Good job by all. Quaid's role as Houston is not up to par for him. But that may have been all he had to work with. Worth seeing nevertheless. 4 stars. Larry Scantlebury",1107561600,2,1823,4.545731707317073

All the lead actors give credible performance, Billy Bo Thornton being the best of them. Even Jason Patric (will he ever suceed in recovering from SPEED 2? I think he will after all!)does a very good job as Jim Bowie. I found it funny that Marc Blucas (the Riley from BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER) plays a very, very small role as James Bonham...

2080349,5,B0002DRDCS,The reviewer who points out that the defenders of the Alamo supported slavery and then gives the film only 1 star because it doesn't tell the truth about the pro-slavery stance of Alamo defenders towards slavery must have missed much of the film. Slavery is not ignored in this film. IT'S IN THE MOVIE. SLAVERY IS INDEED A PART OF THIS FILM. Defenders of the Alamo are shown to be slave owners. The perspective of those humans who are enslaved is also given in this film and done well. Slavery is in no way left out of the equation. This film shows various perspectives and sides and doesn't hide the flaws of those involved. I liked that.,1104883200,,639,4.47008547008547
2080350,4,B0002DRDCS,"The Alamo is a brilliant account of the 180 men that stood up against an army of thousands of soldiers who were trained to fight in brutal conditions while they themselves are mostly militia men with shotguns.

Led by Col. William Travis [played by Patrick Wilson] they hold themselves up inside a church/mission that wasn't even built for warfare. Several of the buildings have been transformed into barracks and an infirmary. Most of the walls are crumbling and several of the buildings don't even have roofs on top.

Nevertheless the men decide to stay and guard it as the Mexican army starts marching toward the town near the mission without the men's knowing. James Bowie [played by Jason Patric], famous for being a knife fighter and weilding a huge blade for a knife, wants to be in charge seeing how he doesn't like Travis.

However his illness prevents him from really fighting anymore, he was shot and stabbed multiple times in his life, and soon is confined to his bed for the last half of the movie.

Travis has problems of his own, and one of them includes getting the respect of his men. One scene does the impossible as a cannonball lands in the middle of the courtyard. No one goes near it, for fear of it exploding, but Travis gets up, cuts the fuse cord off the cannonball, and tells his men to fire it back at the enemy.

His little act starts to give his men something to believe in and soon also even gets Bowie's respect for him as a leader, something that Travis really needed in order for him to keep his little militia together.

Meanwhile the Mexican Army, led by their General Santa Anna, are shown by the Director's best at not being evil. It is mostly Santa Anna that is telling his soldiers to kill innocent people, not the soldiers themselves. Some of the Mexican soldiers are even little kids, who are way too young to go fight in battles and possibly be killed before they are even young adults.

Even one of Santa Anna's own officers starts to think differently about Santa Anna. Especially after a little speech by the head General, in which he said that he was the one governing the rules and that he needed blood for victory.

He said this after telling his men to lead their soldiers in an attack, rather than waiting for several cannons that were arriving only hours after the morning sun.

But besides the acting one scene stole the show, as the Mexican army always used their band to sing a song that in English translated to ""Slit Throat."" This was right before they usually bombed the mission at night to keep the texans inside awake all night.

But one night David Crockett [played by Billy Bob Thorton] decided to lighten the depressing tune of the song by climbing up a tower and playing his violin along with the music. And for one night, both sides decided just to listen to the music with its new sense of style and kept a short truce that night.

This is a great movie with lots of drama and action scenes in it. The acting is one of the best I've seen, especially by Thorton, whos movies I don't really watch. Both sides are equally protrayed by the right actors and actresses for that matter as well. Plus several little storylines entwined here and there keeps this movie as exciting an moving as it started out.",1104710400,3,3265,4.516949152542373
2080351,5,B0002DRDCS,Absolutely one of the best historic films I have ever seen. It brought tears to my eyes. This one is right up there as one of my top 10 favorites!,1104624000,,146,3.9
2080352,4,B0002DRDCS,"Seeing that John Lee Hancock's THE ALAMO was released just before the summer of 2004---too far off for this movie to be seriously considered for any of the major movie awards---I usually wouldn't have made it a priority to see it. Still, as a staff member for the Daily Targum---the newspaper of Rutgers University---I was assigned the task of writing up a review for this movie. The advance buzz on this movie was not promising: it was originally supposed to be released at around Christmastime last year, but was pushed back for further recutting. That, and an apparently troubled production history, spelled out a possible disaster of a movie. As it turns out, THE ALAMO is hardly a disaster. It might not be a first-rate historical drama, but it has some elements to it that makes it special.

My biggest reservation about THE ALAMO is that much of it seems rather stodgy, more like a history lesson than a real flesh-and-blood movie, with historical figures and incidents that are depicted onscreen but never really dramatized in a way that draws us into this historical period and the sticky situation these poor Texians find themselves in, having to defend their state all by themselves, without anything resembling reinforcements. THE ALAMO often seems workmanlike rather than truly inspired---a respectable movie but not always a genuinely compelling one.

And yet, there is at least one thing in this movie that I think make it worth seeing at least once. Three words: Billy Bob Thornton. His portrayal of Davy Crockett is the standout performance of the film, one with the kind of sympathy and imagination that is somewhat missing from some of the other performances. This Crockett is one that struggles to maintain his legendary status, rather than one that revels in it, and Thornton brings out the man's underlying humanity in a way that lights up the screen whenever he's around. And, as the title of my review suggests, there is one scene involving Crockett that is I think is worth waiting for. It comes about 2/3s of the way through (I recall): it is dusk, there is a lull in the action, and Crockett, hearing a Mexican band performing on the other side, decides to take out his fiddle and play along. Okay, it doesn't sound like anything special, the way I describe it...but once you see it, you won't forget it. In its own way, that one poignant scene makes as powerful a statement against war as, say, all of APOCALYPSE NOW or PLATOON or other classic anti-war statements. For that one brief moment at the Alamo, differences are placed aside and the enemies simply revel in the power of music. Perhaps they are also reflecting on what Roger Ebert, in his review of the movie, describes as ""the innocence they have lost.""

While THE ALAMO is undoubtedly well-made, with some striking cinematography by Dean Semler and some well-filmed battle scenes, the drama remains somewhat earthbound through a good deal of its 137 minutes. It is only whenever Billy Bob Thornton appears on the screen, and during that one magical scene, that THE ALAMO rises to greater heights---and I think those moments are enough to recommend the movie.",1104192000,4,3147,4.856610800744879
2080353,3,B0002DRDCS,"Watching Fess Parker in the 1950s play Davy Crocket in the Disney series made John Wayne less than believable in his 1960 ""The Alamo"" movie. Yes, I am that old, but still open minded. The 1960s was the era of the historical epic film typified by ""Spartacus,"" ""Ben-Hur,"" and eventually producing the period's classic, ""Doctor Zhivago."" Like ""Braveheart,"" big budget productions mixed a minute amount of real history with valiant action and portrayed larger-than-life characters using larger-than-life actors such as John Wayne, Omar Sharif, and Charlton Heston.

Davy Crocket was a mythical hero that could only be played by a mythical actor like John Wayne. Fess Parker and John Wayne's characters died in swashbuckling fashion fitting of a legend. Texans like their state and their demigods in mammoth proportions. The Alamo of Fess Parker and John Wayne fits this demand perfectly.

Enter onto the historical/movie stage recently discovered manuscripts that portray a radically different end to Davy Crocket and his compatriots. Believe this to be an actual Mexican officer's first-hand account or not, this manuscript contends that Crocket was captured alive then executed. The new film's Santa Anna is not bogged down (as portrayed in the 1960s version) by trying to subdue The Alamo, before moving on the rest of Texas. Instead, the crafty Mexican dictator/generalissimo's intention is to trap the Texicans in the Alamo and then draw Sam Houston and his small army into a destine-to-fail battle on Santa Anna's terms. Houston does not fall for the pending ambush and knowingly sacrifices the Alamo's garrison in order to save the fledgling Texas army. Hence, he saves Texas from becoming a province of Mexico. For the first time on film the battle of San Jacinto becomes the finale of the Alamo story rather than Davy Crocket swinging his musket. While heroic in the face of certain annihilation, the Alamo was not the genesis of an independent Texas--San Jacinto was.

Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of Davy Crocket as a man trying to live up to his own legend is the best that has been done on any sized screen. Although weakly acted, Sam Houston, Jim Bowie, and William Travis are all shown as men trying to escape their pasts and remolding themselves in a new land. If you want to see an action-packed yee-haw Alamo get the John Wayne version.

After seeing it on DVD, I'm glad I didn't see it on the big screen, because it would have been a waste of a lot more money and I would have fallen asleep.  At least I was at home when I fell asleep through the middle section of this film.

I don't fault the actors for this film.  This is the kind of film that looked like a lot more fun for the actors playing in it than for the viewers who have to watch it.  I don't know much about the Alamo history, but I am a fan of historical films and always want more of them made.  The reason is because I think they do a great service in helping us imagine what it was like back during that time period.  This film gets a lot of those details right and the actors do a great job in their roles.  However, the film has too many long stretches where nothing is happening.  Bits of conversations here and there, we get glimpses into the lives of Sam Houston, David Crockett, Jim Bowie, and Colonel Santa Anna of the Mexican Army (who fancies himself the Napoleon of the West).  The film moves along at a snail's pace and wasn't interesting until the last half hour or so when the big battle takes place, followed by another cool battle scene.  Unfortunately, that's not enough to save this film.  I'm not sure what needed to be done to fix this film, but obviously, it didn't do well at the box office for a reason that most people wouldn't have the patience to sit through a slow motion movie like this one.  I was hoping for a much more exciting movie, and this is from a guy who was hesitant to see ""Master and Commander:  The Far Side of the World"" because he expected that film to be boring but was pleasantly surprised by.  By comparison, this film is no ""Master and Commander"".  This movie is perfect for any insomniacs out there who find counting sheep doesn't do the trick.

I cannot attest to the historical accuracy, but the film works beautifully as a meditation on the themes of heroism, love, death, and the cruelty of war.  If the film has a weakness, it is the failure to explain more precisely the events that led to this seminal battle, but this did not substantially diminish my enjoyment.  What the film so beautifully accomplishes is putting a human face on the participants to the conflict: their motivations, weaknesses, fears, and ultimately their devastating heroism.  With the exception of Santa Anna himself, even the ""enemy"" troops are portrayed sympathetically as victims of forces beyond their control: there is a haunting scene where Santa Anna's band is playing and the Crockett character accompanies them on his fiddle (as part of a uniformly lovely soundtrack), during which I was irrationally tempted to hope that everyone would recognize their common humanity and come to their senses.  But of course, like the countless other slaughters that have occurred throughout human history, this one proceeds inexorably to its grim conclusion.  At a time when the overwhelming majority of U.S. citizens remain safely distanced from the violence in Iraq, this film is a poignant reminder that each life is precious and that the horrors of war should never be underestimated.",1101513600,3,1478,5.061728395061729

2080359,5,B0002DRDCS,"Some dislike Hancock's Alamo because it's not John Wayne's version or nit-pick at it for some other reason. The reviewer who states that the set designer of this film ""failed to locate the Alamo chapel the proper position to the Convent/Long Barracks building"" and claims that this ""ruined"" the movie really takes the cake. It's a MOVIE! The same critic then asks ""What if John Wayne would have had the special effects capabilities this director had?""  when it's obvious Wayne's version isn't completely correct either so even with modern special effects the critic would have complained about that version too! I love the Wayne version and it has flaws but does that get in the way of me enjoying it? Hell No! Why be a Scrooge? These are good MOVIES! I enjoyed both versions. Billy Bob and the Duke both deliver and I found both versions to be compelling.

2080360,2,B0002DRDCS,"This version of The Alamo lost its claim to historical accuracy when its set designer failed to locate the Alamo Chapel the proper position to the Convent/Long Barracks building. A quick trip to San Antonio with measuring tools would have prevented this unacceptable error.

Getting it right is important in this historical movie. In many cases, it is likely ""right on"", but the glaring error described above ruined it for me. That error casts doubt on all other historically debatable topics presented in the film.

Another part that bothers me has to do with the time of the final battle. Although the battle likely started at dawn, I do not feel the entire battle would have been conducted in the dark. Why? Too hard to control troop movements, Too easy to shoot your own people.

2080361,4,B0002DRDCS,"Just 15 years removed from a hard-fought struggle for its independence from Spain in 1821, Mexico found itself unable to bridge the cultural gap with the aggressive Texas settlers looking for their own country. After establishing a provincial government, the Texans appointed Sam Houston commander of their army in early 1836.

Thus began a back and forth grudge-match for control of San Antonio, the heart of Texas, punctuated by a massacre at a tiny, unfinished missionary known as The Alamo. A band of no more than 200 Texan settlers held off a siege of some 4,000 Mexicans, who were commanded by General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.

Under the direction of Cols. William Travis and James Bowie, as well as the legendary frontiersman and Congressman Davy Crockett, the men held their post for almost two weeks awaiting reinforcements from Gen. Houston.

Assistance never arrived. Finally, on the evening of March 6, 1836, the Texans relinquished The Alamo to the Mexican troops in a bloody onslaught. Not a single Texan life was salvaged, with many corpses mutilated and beheaded at Gen. Santa Anna's request.

When reinforcements did arrive at The Alamo a grisly sight lay ahead. All that remained of their comrades was a towering heap of smoldering flesh. However, six months later, exclaiming the mantra, ""Remember The Alamo"" through clenched teeth, Texans would get their revenge at San Jacinto. In a matter of 18 minutes, though outnumbered three to one, Gen. Houston conquered the Mexican forces and captured Gen. Santa Anna, sparing his life in exchange for Texas' independence.

This is a story some of us have come to know quite well. Being a San Antonian by birthright, this tale has an unshakable foundation in my upbringing.

This brings me to the multi-million-dollar remake of John Wayne's Western classic, ""The Alamo,"" a first-rate period piece starring Billy Bob Thornton as Crockett, Dennis Quaid as Houston and Jason Patric as Bowie.

Surprisingly, for a picture that was so breast-fed by a major studio, ""The Alamo"" rubbed off as very non-Hollywood. The raw intensity, the breathtaking shots of the Texas landscape and, most importantly, the seemingly unrehearsed virtuosity of the cast make this film an immediate sibling to such notable Texas-rooted cinema as ""Giant"" and ""Hud.""

Thornton captures Crockett in such a fetching style that viewers can't help but bow their heads and take a knee in mourning his valiant death. Patric is rough-and-tumble as the disturbed Bowie, twirling his oversized knife like a baton whenever slightly threatened. As for Quaid as Gen. Houston, well, by God, I know I'd charge headstrong into battle for him with the phrase, ""Remember The Alamo,"" clanging my vocal chords.

Director John Lee Hancock has fashioned a film that truly captures the essence of those gallant Texas men who refused to submit to far superior numbers for 13 long days. I commend him on that. In this day and age it's rare for an epic with a hefty purse to carry such an attribute.",1100476800,4,3010,5.028112449799197
2080362,5,B0002DRDCS,Great movie! Even it's critics on here provide me with entertainment value! Check out the critic that uses Sam Houston's alcoholism as an example of a flaw in this film and how Houston's leadership in avenging the Alamo and defeating the Mexican forces is said to be a flaw. Houston REALLY did that and Houston WAS an alcoholic! LOL! Take a look at the criticism that Travis abandoning his wife is a flaw in the film when Travis REALLY DID THAT! I could go on and on but you get the point. Those type of confused reviews really don't reflect the quality of this film.,1100044800,4,567,4.40952380952381
2080363,1,B0002DRDCS,"Typical Hollywood format crap, plus the acting sucks.

So, it seems the makers intended this to be some great oscar worthy historical epic - with great characters immersed into a true tale of mythic porportions.

Great intent, but the execution is as bloody as the massacre at the Alamo.

It doesn't get more stereotypical than the predictable and inconsistent portrayals of these mythical characters:

the coward Travis, prefering ""dandy"" clothing, abandoning his wife and child who ends up heroically leading his troops to a hopeless death;

the alcoholic mad Houston, that everyone considered 'washed-up', who avenges the Alamo with his genious;

the dying crumugeon unofficial troops leader Bowie, personally grieving the loss of his Tejan wife whom he sees in his fits of illness, who blesses Travis as the leader after Travis gives one of those prerequisite speeches to the troops that wins them over to follow him to the death;

the humble Crocket serving as mentor and silent diplomat to the conflicting chanracters who alone survives the attack to finally be executed by Santa Ana.

Did I mention the acting sucked?

2080364,4,B0002DRDCS,"Hollywood in the information age has made great strives towards historical accuracy, and Mark Johnson (Prod.) and John Lee Hancock's (Dir.) ""The Alamo"" is no exception. In fact, if this film were a book, it could easily be argued that the production assumes a considerable amount of prior knowledge on its audience. For those who have familiarized themselves with William C. Davis' _Three Roads to the Alamo_ (1998); the forensic revision _Alamo Traces_ (2003) by Thomas Ricks Lindley; or Stephen L. Hardin's _Texian Iliad_ (1994), this film will delight, as well as, tantalize. Hancock and company have not only turned in a graduate level production on a topic so shrouded in myth, but also cranked out a darn fine movie. Hancock, a native Texan, claimed he was just trying to get the story right. Historians have faced that same challenge since the 1920s, when the first serious scholarship regarding the Alamo began to appear. Eight decades, and mountains of literature later, (not to mention monumental changes in the way history is produced and consumed) we are still not completely sure how events unfolded during those thirteen fateful days leading up too March 6, 1836. The film centers on this epic's four most colorful characters: David Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton), James Bowie (Jason Patric), William B. Travis (Patrick Wilson) and Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid). Their lives prior to the Alamo produce the most glaring gaps in the film: Crockett's inner turmoil to live up too his superstar status; Bowie's haunting memories of his dead wife; a bittersweet divorce for Travis; and Houston's bout with depression and alcoholism only scratch the surface of these complex men. The shadier sides of their characters are only briefly hinted at in a line or two. The view from the other side of the hill is admirably done, especially the performance of Emilio Echevarria as Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. Many of the lesser known figures abound in the film, and many common myths are squelched as well. Unlike the TV movie ""The Alamo: 13 Days to Glory"" (1987), the most famous female survivor, Susanna Dickinson's voice is muted. This adheres to the criticism historians have levelled at her supposed eye witness accounts of the battle. The Tejano experience is subdued; for them, this was a true brother-against-brother civil war. Travis draws no line in the sand, and the liberty taken concerning Crockett's death is Hancock's most daring historical gamble. The film contains many poignant scenes. Billy Bob Thornton delivers a stellar performance as Crockett, and Wilson is most impressive as Travis. Patric and Quaid's performance, however, could not measure up to the complex figures they portrayed. The fifty-one acre set, accurately recreated down to minute detail, brilliant cinematography, wardrobe, and realistic battle scenes, propel this film to the top of the list of Alamo filmography. The DVD's behind-the-scenes extras and deleted scenes amplify those qualities. For the uninitiated, the historical gaps may dull the excitement. Yet, for the arm-chair historian, the temptation to fill them will be both rewarding and enjoyable.",1099872000,3,3146,5.219367588932807
2080365,5,B0002DRDCS,"I've watched the Alamo three times now and enjoyed it more and more each time. The entire cast is excellent and the writing is spot on too. I've seen some less than kind comments on here about this film and simply do not agree with them. Patric's Bowie, like everything else in this film, has recieved some unkind comments and I thought he was superb. It's the first time I've seen anything close to the mythic and historic Jim Bowie on film. Most of the time they just give an actor a knife and throw the Bowie of myth and history out the window but not this time. This is a marvelous film. Hancock did it right.",1099785600,3,613,4.247863247863248
2080366,4,B0002DRDCS,"This new version of the often told story certainly holds up well as far as historic accuracy, though it is by no means perfect in this regard.  The look of the movie is impressive, owing in large part to the fine art direction and Dean Semler's excellent photography.  If the acting had been better, and the film had had fewer ""dead"" spots (such as moments of conversation that really don't progress the story), I might have been kinder with my rating.  The one bright spot is the performance of Billy Bob Thornton as David Crockett, far more human, yet intelligent, than often portrayed in other films.  The low spot is the acting of Patrick Wilson as William Barret Travis, a portrayal that should make viewers wonder how he could have ever been given a command.

John Lee Hancock's direction is more than adequate, but I will go to my grave wondering what a Ron Howard directed movie would have looked like had Disney given him the ""R"" rated okay.  My guess is that Howard would have done a superb job keeping the attention of the audience, as his other films have proven so well.

In comparison to the John Wayne epic from 1960, the new film falls short in terms of outright entertainment, while the acting in the Wayne movie is certainly no better.  But, at least, Wayne knew how to make a thirteen day siege seem exciting.  Where the battle, as depicted in the new film, shows scared men doing the best they can to stay alive, the 1960 Wayne film shows a more heroic stand, men selling their lives dearly.  The viewer will have to decide which version is the more ""entertaining"".

Having given a ""thumbs up"" to the art direction and cinematography in the new film, the 1960 movie also sported great work behind the camera, most notably William H. Clothier at the camera, perhaps an unsung hero in the film world.  Alfred Ybarra's art direction was masterful, presenting a set that brings to mind just how isolated the men in the Alamo really were.

One thing Ybarra did that haunts me to this day: the image of the Alamo church (known to fans as ""The Waynamo"").  Where production designer Michael Corenblith decided to move the church forward in the 2004 version (putting it in line with the rest of the fort on the east side), Ybarra left the church in its rightful place, back and seamingly away from the rest of the mission, with low walls on either side of it.  This created a powerful silhouette against the brilliant Texas sky.  Cameraman Clothier knew that the church was one of the most famous icons in America, and made sure it loomed in the background in as many shots as possible.  To me, and others, this image of the burned out church WAS the Alamo, an unconscious reminder of the sacrfice good men on both sides made for their beliefs.",1099699200,6,2755,4.555780933062881
2080367,2,B0002DRDCS,"This 2004 version of the 13-day standoff by American troops against the Mexicans in 1824 is just plain boring.  And even the acting of Billy Bob Thornton, cast as Davy Crocket and Jason Patric, cast as Jim Bowie cannot save it.  I can't understand why I even watched the entire 137 minutes.  I actually slept through a lot of it and felt I didn't miss anything when I woke up.

Basically, I never cared one whit as to whether the troops would survive, especially since the film opened with all of them dead and then did a flashback on how that happened. At no time did I have any empathy with them or their cause.  And the Mexican troops, who were depicted as the bad guys were equally silly.

I'm sure there were a few factual details embedded somewhere in the story.  But the only thing I understood was that a lot of people died needlessly for a hopeless cause.  It's an old story that has been repeated over and over and still makes no sense.

The best thing about the film was the cinematography. There were a lot a scenes shot against sunsets, some of them in silhouette, and these were very artistic.  It didn't help the screenplay or the acting or the historical distortion though.",1099612800,6,1189,4.43778801843318

Well, as someone who did not grow up in Texas (I'm from Kansas), I was certainly familiar with the story, but this film helped me see the Alamo martyrs as more that just some ragtag mob of guys who were in the wrong place at the right time... Made by a Texan director with numerous actors who also grew up in Texas, this film pays sincere homage to the Alamo's defenders without being overly adulatory or fawning.  It's not a perfect film...It takes a while for their characters to settle into your mind enough for you to care what happens to them (and in some cases, this never really happens: Jason Petric's Jim Bowie is a bore from start to finish)... The film also gives the Mexicans their due: although Santa Anna is portrayed as a ruthless sadist (which he was), he also gets one of the scripts most illuminating scenes, in which he defends his no-quarter-given policy of annihilation to his military staff: In Santa Anna's view, the Texians plan an incursion on Mexican sovereignty that will mean political humiliation and economic subjugation of Mexico to the United States, which in fact is what happened.  Although he is a heartless (...), he is also a patriot and, in his way, he was completely right.  So, the film isn't completely one-sided, and while it does have it's flat, creaky, big-budget moments, I did find it useful as an ""historical"" film to explain the significance of this one, small, dramatic battle.",1099612800,,1484,4.696153846153846

History point of view aside, the film essentially centres at the heroic spirit lives within the fighters for one of the most guarded states in America today. The shooting took place of more than 4,000 crews for its Mexican troops and 200 Texan soldiers, with a hundreds-year old retreat built as the military fort. The first and second quarters of the film told well of some facts of three leading defenders of the Alamo, the drunken outlaw colonel Jim Bowie (Jason Patric), the dandy lieutenant-colonel William Travis (Patrick Wilson), and the widely admired defender Davy Crockett (a charismatic Billy Bob Thornton) with a handy grapse of pipe tune. The last quarter abruptly laid down the fate of these heros and the Alamo fellowship began to fall apart under the Mexican's attack before sunset. Familiar tough guy Dennis Quaid plays the brooding general Sam Houston who quickly rose above his ignorance and lead the force to turn around the table of battle in 18 minutes.

2080371,5,B0002DRDCS,The Alamo provides us with a look at the heroes of the Alamo from a different perspective than other full length feature films which have come before. This version casts these historical figures in a different light than the legendary and mythic films of the past and concentrates on giving us far more of the reality of the people involved. Some critics have said that the conflict of myth versus reality in the case of Crockett was only touched on in the film in one conversation. Not so. Davy strugles with it through the entire picture time and again. Give it another look and you'll see. Crockett's struggle with his own myth is there and the film does an effective job of exploring it and of making these heroes of legend be seen as very real humans of flesh and blood.,1098144000,4,775,4.50354609929078
2080372,5,B0002DRDCS,"Dispensing with the legendary tales of this historical event, the 2004 film ""The Alamo"" is an exciting and emotionally-charged historical epic. I sat down to watch the film with some skepticism (because of all the negative reviews I have read), but by the end, I was impressed. ""The Alamo"" is a great film with great battle scenes and fine performances. While Billy Bob Thornton (as David Crockett), Jason Patric (as Jim Bowie), and Patrick Wilson (as William Travis) give exceptional performances, the highlight of the film in terms of acting is Dennis Quaid's exceptional portrayal of Sam Houston, the man who led Texas to victory at the battle of San Jacinto less than two months after the fall of the Alamo. The battle scenes, especially the pre-dawn attack on the Alamo and the battle of San Jacinto, are done with historical accuracy and epic sweep, putting you in the middle of these great conflicts. The DVD has some fantastic extras including historical commentary.

2080375,3,B0002DRDCS,"The story of the Alamo is a powerful one. Few have not heard of this little Spanish mission in Texas and the brave men who defended it. We remember the great Davy Crockett, the famous pioneer who sold his life in the defense of the place, and Jim Bowie, the infamous knife-fighter, who fought alongside him. These renowned names have turned the Alamo into one of the many early American legends in fewer than 200 years.

So it doesn't seem very surprising that a modern movie should be made of the event. The question one must inevitably ask is: Is it good?

It tries to be.

Starring Billy-Bob Thornton as the legendary Davy Crockett, the Alamo begins with the outcome we already know--the victorious but somewhat somber Mexican army is picking through the remains of the mission. After a few scenes of the resulting consternation and sorrow that results from the news, the movie shifts back a year, tracing the lives of the four main heroes at the Alamo prior to the battle in a few somewhat bewildering sequences in which it is difficult to tell exactly who everyone is or what is going on.

So then, by the time the Mexicans start marching for the Alamo and you have unravelled everything, you settle back and wait for a good movie.

The resultant film is a disjointed mix-and-match game, pulling pieces off of previous epic films like the Patriot, the Last Samurai, Zulu, and so on, stringing them together, and then leaving them there without making them cohesive.

Look at it this way: it had many elements of a good film that went deeper than just the combat and looked at the heroes themselves, at the minds of the commanders and the value of human life--but it failed to bring all these elements to a head. We have Davy Crockett discussing the difficulty of being the expected hero before a crowd of admirers while old Davy from Tennesee doesn't feel up to it. This would be a nice place to set up a subplot of Crockett and Bowie conflicted between their legends and themselves. But nothing comes of this. We have that single conversation, and that's it.

There were other good points; don't get me wrong. Crockett's last words were well-done. But this was, like the rest, a little tidbit or glimpse of an epic which never formed itself into a gripping whole.

The final battle between General Sam Houston and the army of Santa Ana was one of the better parts of the film, although it still failed to salvage it.

But all in all, this movie is somewhat like a 2-hour trailer of itself. We have a little tidbit of this here, a little of that there, and it never materializes into what you expect. It could have been good. The acting was not stellar or worthy of an Oscar nomination, but the actors played who they were supposed to and the four main characters in particular performed solidly.

The screenplay was adequate, and the directing was O.K., although the battle scenes were cut off a little short. (Don't get me wrong here, I don't want extended, R-rated battle scenes filled with gore and blood. But this movie is about a battle, everyone was expecting a battle, and I think one can be used in the proper way-to make a movie dramatic, moving, and suspensful. Probably it could even have been cut off where it was in a way that worked, but the way the director did it seemed to hack them off a little abruptly.) The special effects, what there were of them, were not very impressive either, but as this movie did not hang on its special effects-which is actually a good thing-that does not really mar the overall film.

For a movie that gave its best shot at the mark of epic greatness and found it had just fired a load of buckshot, of which only a few pieces hit the bulls-eye, The Alamo gets a 3 out of 5.",1097884800,4,3726,4.505185185185185

2080377,5,B0002DRDCS,"THE ALAMO, starring Dennis Quaid, Billy Bob Thornton and Jason Patric, does as good a job at conveying historical fact as any movie made on the subject.  Let's face it.  No movie, even Costnerian epics that last four full hours, has enough time to do justice to any important historical story.  THE ALAMO comes as close as any historical epic that I have ever seen.

The key aspects of the events leading up to the thirteen-day siege, the battle itself, the Battle of San Jacinto and the biographical sketches of the key historical figures are all there.  No melodrama.  No needless exaggeration.  No unnecessary romance.

The movie handles some difficult historical questions as well.  What actually happened to David Crockett?  How was he ultimately killed?  Historians have argued about it for nearly two-hundred years.  For me, the movie handled the question perfectly.

While Dennis Quaid is a great Sam Houston and Jason Patric shines as the legendary James Bowie, Billy Bob Thornton is masterful as the larger-than-life David Crockett.  His personality, his accent, his ready smile and his overall presence are nothing short of outstanding.

THE ALAMO is a splendid movie with a voice all its own, taking nothing away from previous classics like the original starring John Wayne.  A must see for all genuine Texans and for the rest of us who think we are!

2080381,3,B0002DRDCS,"You may know that the new 'Alamo' film, directed by John Lee Hancock ('The Rookie') has met a commercial failure on US boxoffice chart.  But I think more stress should be given to 'commercial' rather than 'failure' because this 'Alamo' is not a total failure as the poor response of the audience implies.  It is good, though flawed.

Actually, the acting is not only good, it's great.  You know the story of the Alamo, so I skip the story.  Billy Bob Thornton plays David Crocket, the legendary figure in the US history.  Sam Huston is played by Dennis Quiad, Jim Bowie by Jason Patrick while William Travis is portrayed by newcomer Patrick Wilson.  Each one of them gives memorable portraits of the characters you think you know.

The strength of the film is this -- characters.  They are no longer larger-than-life pictures you should look up to; they are more flawed, more delicate, and more human.  On that score. Hancock's 'Alamo' is called a great success.  The famous episode of drawing a line with a sabre on the ground is not included.  Instead, David Crocket (who is not only good at shooting a rifle, but at playing the violin) does not die in the same way John Wayne did.  You like it or not, those attitudes represent the new film's intention.

But there are weak points, and they clearly show.  Though the 137-minute film is comparatively short (I mean, compared with John Wayne's 3 hour epic), it feels still too long.  the film attempts to be 'mutli-layered,' or, to present the events from many ethnic viewpoints, but this, I believe, is a very misguided idea.  It not only involves the Mexican's views, but the Afro-Americans'.  That's honorable, but only shakes and confuses the film's viewpoint which should remain firm.  For, in the end, you're not sure what the film really wants to say.

The photography of Dean Semler ('Dances with the Wolves') is Oscar-worthy, and the production designs of the fort and the fierce battle scenes are in themselves the state-of-the-art assets.  But the film is so unsure of its purpose to be made -- regarding this point, John Wayne's gung-ho 1960 'Alamo' was so sure of it --  and we audience sense that.  Perhaps, some materials cannot be touched in the new millenium, and 'The Alamo' might be telling us that fact.",1097366400,5,2274,4.730279898218829

Because it knows, I guess, that it's totally failed to get you riled up before that, and now it's two hours into the film, and if it doesn't get your pulse going now, it's never gonna happen.

2080384,5,B0002DRDCS,"""The Alamo"" is an excellent example of what Hollywood does best. It tells personal stories against a sweeping historical background. The film recreates the legendary 13-day siege of the Alamo, when, in the winter of 1836, a group of about 180 federalist army and militiamen tried to defend the fort at San Antonio, Texas against the advancing Mexican Army under the command of General Santa Anna. They were impossibly outnumbered, as they waited for reinforcements that never came. But the volatile mix of Army, Texas militia, and Tejano militia fighters were all committed, for various reasons of their own, to securing independence for Texas, which was then part of Mexico. ""As the Alamo goes, so goes Texas,"" they believed. Ironically, their defeat facilitated Texan independence.

The story of ""The Alamo"" lends itself perfectly to epic filmmaking. A more interesting and notable collection of characters could not be imagined. Nor could a more complex, pivotal, and stressful scenario. The film integrates character studies of the three most talked about and influential men at The Alamo into the story of Texas' most infamous battle. Commanding the regular army at the fort was Lt. Colonel William Travis (Patrick Wilson), a very image-conscious man in his twenties. Having already been a newspaperman, a lawyer, abandoned one family, and gambled his way into debt, he now sought greatness in a military career. He thought he'd never see action at The Alamo. Commanding the militiamen was the legendary Col. James Bowie (Jason Patric), consumptive land-swindler, slave-trader, knife-fighter extraordinaire -hence the ""bowie knife"". He was a living epitome of frontier legend. Ambition brought another legend, David Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton), to the Alamo. Known far and wide for his great feats of outdoormanship and fresh from two terms representing Tennessee in Congress, he joined the Texan militia for land and political opportunity. Most of the film is spent on the 13-day siege, but unlike most Alamo films, this one doesn't end there. We follow the movements of another military legend, General Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid), whose strategy eventually defeated General Santa Anna. Alcoholic and a touch imbalanced, Houston adds to the cast of fascinating, colorful characters that populated the Texas frontier. These 4 men have very little in common on the face of it. But they were all very ambitious and extremely mindful of self-promotion. It's no wonder their personalities are larger than life, as their legends were even in their own time.

Director John Lee Hancock has gone to extraordinary lengths to make this film historically accurate. There are inevitable changes in chronology and extra scenes necessary to demonstrate some point. But apart from some details that were consciously changed, ""The Alamo"" is remarkably and admirably accurate. Both American and Mexican records were relied upon to get things right, and historians of every ilk were consulted. Since there are records of who was present at the siege of the Alamo, each extra took on a specific identity. The most memorable performance of the film is Billy Bob Thornton's, but that is probably because he plays the most interesting character. The cast is universally superb. Of course, the siege of the Alamo has always been a hotly debated topic. I've never understood what there is to debate. Like the United States' founders a generation before them, the men who fought for Texan independence did so for both personal gain and ideological advancement. Mexico had every right to defend its territory, although not to abolish Texas' constitution. Mexico lost. But the conflict's final battles are a fascinating part of US history. ""The Alamo"" is epic filmmaking at its finest: Well-written, brilliantly portrayed characters against a backdrop of historically important, meticulously recreated events. It's great entertainment, and it's informative.

The DVD: I have to mention the audio commentary first, because it's superb. Military historian Alan Hughes and Texas historian Stephen Hardin, both of whom advised on the film, do the commentary. They discuss historical accuracy, including the occasions on which the film departs from reality and why. And they provide a great deal of context and detail in addition to what we saw in the movie. It's worth sitting through the film twice to hear it. Other bonus features include 3 featurettes and 5 deleted scenes with commentary by director John Lee Hancock. ""Return of the Legend: The Making of the Alamo"" (18 minutes) provides a nice overview of how and why  ""The Alamo"" was made the way it was, including interviews with John Lee Hancock, principle actors, various historical consultants, costume designer Daniel Orlandi, and the SpyderCam operators, among others. It includes an interesting look at ""The Alamo""s 51-acre set, the largest ever constructed in North America. ""Deep in the Heart of Texas"" interviews the considerable number of cast and principle crew who are from Texas, including the film's director and its many extras/re-enactors. ""Walking in the Footsteps of Heroes"" profiles the 4 legendary men depicted in the film: William Travis, James Bowie, David Crockett, and General Sam Houston.

2080385,4,B0002DRDCS,"I have always enjoyed John Wayne's 1960 version of the Alamo even though it was historically inaccurate. Disney has made a nobel effort to get it right! They re-created San Antonio accurately in time with 1836.

I enjoyed the film, but I must admit constantly comparing it to the 1960 version. The films have their own agendas. Wayne's film was very patriotic and heroic as compared to the Disney's darker and more stark version.

I was very impressed with Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of David Crockett. His performance seemed more authentic than the Duke. My favorite scene was Crockett playing his fiddle in defiance to Santa Anna's army band. Billy Bob's Crockett was in self-conflict trying to live up to his super-human legend. John Wayne's Crockett was comfortable with his legend status.

I felt the battle scenes leading to the fall of the Alamo seemed to be short as compared to John Wayne's version. The 1960 film exploited the overwhelming odds against the defenders with tension building up day by day. Disney's film just showed them suddenly being attacked during nightfall without any cinematic build up.

Of course, the big difference was John Wayne's heroic death scene compared to Billy Bob's Crockett being captured and executed!

Overall, I thought ""The Alamo"" was a very good film even with it's flaws.",1097107200,,1325,5.004545454545455

2080387,1,B0002DRDCS,"What an awful depiction of such a historical event.

Sure, the history (as told in the movie) is more acurate than John Wayne's classic - BUT - and this is important - there was absolutely no soul or feeling in this movie.  The characters are thrown up on the movie screen - with very little backstory - and are not the least bit developed.

The screenplay jumps around and by the middle of the movie you are begging for Mexican soldiers to beat the living hell out of the Texans...and I'M A TEXAN.  The actual seige took less time than this movie - I prayed for it to be over!

The casting was also horrible and the acting did not live up to the actors own respective previous works.  What a shame for all involved.

All in all, this movie was a huge disappointment.  There was 0 return on my investment.  That is $20 and two and a half hours I will never get back!",1096934400,5,866,4.2
2080388,4,B0002DRDCS,"When Oliver Stone's PLATOON was released in 1986, it was both hailed and reviled.  It depended upon the viewer's point of view.  Many Vietman veterans cheered, grateful that the real story of their experiences had been depected with accuracy.  Many other vets complained that ""their"" story had been left out, that their point of view wasn't represented.  Unless you made a movie that would run for many days, you could not include everone's point of view.  This was the work of a single filmmaker;storyteller.  It was Stone's point of view.  It was one single movie.

I rented the DVD of THE ALAMO last night.  I had not seen it in the theatres (I am legally blind and don't go out to theatres).  I did not know what to expect.  I just put in the DVD and pressed play.

What I got was much better than I had been led to expect from the variety of reviews.  I was particularily interested in the way Col. Travis was played, having only the Laurence Harvey version from John Wayne's epic as a guide.  Here, I saw a young man who wanted to engage in one kind of war (a cavalry war) and instead finding himself locked into a hopeless defense of a basically indefensivable fortress.  How he accepted that responsibility was the key to his character.  The screenplay developed this character carefully and skillfully.

I was also happy to see that his personal side (a man who abandoned his wife and children) was also shown.  It showed a much more human side, not just to Travis, but to the two other principals:  Bowie and Crockett.

I am somewhat bewildered at the amount of controvery a single film can generate.  It is as if one side says that if you don't like this movie, you are unpatriotic.  This IS history to many, and they will not have it maligned.  Others seem intent on debunking this so-called ""myth-making"" by calling the movie idiotic and childish.

I enjoyed the film.  While I might debate the issue of the final battle (and this debate has become someing of a ""cottage"" industry among many), and whether or not the Mexican army could practically sneek up to the very walls without being detected, my only regret is that there ware so many subtitles, especially in crucial scenes where we are given insights into the motives of Santa Ana and his officers.  Also, a little prologue giving a more indepth explaination of the reasons for the revolt of the Texans against the Mexican Republic would have been helpful.  I had to go to the internet afterwards and do a little research to fully understand all the reasons, on both sides.  The movie should have done a little more of that for me.

Anyway, it's a good movie but it is also just one movie.  It is the view point of only one particular movie maker.  As wsith PLATOON (or even Stone's JFK),  You can't please all the critics all of the time.",1096934400,,2810,4.535856573705179
2080389,4,B0002DRDCS,"The viciousness of the invective that has been hurled toward this film has been stunning. Many reviewers seem to struggle to balance their ignorance with their arrogance, unfairly maligning this fine film. Roger Ebert seems one of the few professional critics to have understood the film.

This is a wonderful disk, with outstanding picture and sound transfer. Most notable among the extras is the commentary by historian Hardin and military advisor Huffines - particularly useful for those who cannot wrap their minds around the differences between popular culture, history, and art. The deleted scenes are a definite plus, but there is so much more that could have been included that this creates hope for a future expanded edition.

As for the film itself, while it is the most historically accurate version of the Alamo story, there is still much to nitpick over. But, as is the responsibility of a popular culture interpretation of historical events, Hancock fully captures the spirit of what was going on in at that particular time and in that particular place. Lovingly recreated is the world of 1836 Texians - American and European immigrants, as well as native Tejanos - uniting in revolt against an oppressive regime in an effort to gain independence. The principals, the fiery Houston, the celebrated Crockett, the fierce Bowie, and the young, unproven Travis, are portrayed as real humans rather than as demigods. Each has his obstacles to overcome, and each shows significant growth as their fates are played out. The actors, particularly Thornton in an Oscar-worthy role, as well as Patric, Wilson, and the marvelous Emilio Echevarr&iacute;a as General Santa Anna, are to be commended for their interpretations of these enigmatic characters.

Hancock has provided us with a thoughtful, intelligent, deliberate, and often subtle film, certainly an explanation for the film's lack of box office success. Even Burwell's score suffers from these ""shortcomings."" Comparisons to John Wayne's 1960 The Alamo are as inevitable as they are pointless, but it's like comparing 2004's The Passion of the Christ to 1961's King of Kings - they are not remakes, but variations on a theme, each with their distinct points of view, merits, and shortcomings.

I abhor criticizing a film for what it is not rather than what it is, but, knowing how much was cut from this film, I sincerely hope that a director's cut will be forthcoming, so we can see Hancock's vision as he intended. That's when I will give it its fifth star.",1096934400,9,2521,5.082125603864735
2080390,5,B0002DRDCS,"I've enjoyed many films about Davy Crockett and the Alamo. Fess Parker's Davy is wonderful. I loved John Wayne's version of the Alamo too. John Lee Hancock's Alamo is superb also. I even liked the Imax Alamo. All of these are entertaining and each one does something different with the legend and fact surrounding the Alamo. I would like to say though that Hancock's Alamo gives us a better view of the real people who were involved with the fall of the Alamo than any other version on film. Some have claimed on here that Hancock's version doesn't let us know the characters the way that Wayne did. Wayne's version is great but I don't think we really get to know characters like Sam Houston or any other historical figure for that matter. Richard Boone was a fine Houston but he doesn't seem anything like the ""mad"" drinker that Houston was supposed to be. And Widmark was enjoyable as Bowie but the dark side of that man was completely absent. I learned more about the real Bowie from Hancock's version. Again I think if you are looking for historical entertainment and want to enjoy a version of the story of the Alamo you just can't go wrong with the Fess Parker, John Wayne, or John Lee Hancock versions. They are all fine. I'm just saying that Hancock put more history in his version and that was a good move that made this version both fresh and informative as well as entertaining.",1096934400,,1390,4.54183266932271

2080395,5,B0002DRDCS,"THE ALAMO suffered in its theatrical release because of the flap it received in the media, articles condemning its production history and personal swings at far too many people.  Had all of those gossipy rumors not surfaced, perhaps the public might have been able to view this solid American history re-enactment for what it is - a well written, character driven, well acted blockbuster grand movie.  Yes, it is lengthy, but the length itself helps communicate the intensity and inevitable failure of the 13-day battle for the Alamo in 1836.  Disparate characters are drawn together from various regions of the young United States for personal reasons, most of those reasons initially were in response to frontierism and greed, but gradually mutated into camaraderie and pride for country. The siege of the Alamo by the Mexican forces led by General Santa Anna (well portrayed by Emilio Echevarria) defeats and slaughters the likes of mythic heroes Davy Crockett (another fine performance imbued with subtlety by Billy Bob Thornton), Jim Bowie (Jason Patrick) and LtCol William Travis (a fine role for the increasingly interesting Patrick Wilson - 'Angels in America').  Within the walls of the Alamo we learn each character's private and public history, a technique in writing that makes the well-known defeat of this small band of clever men even more sad.  Once the Alamo is taken, General Santa Anna decides to fragment his large army in order to attack the remaining general Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid), but Houston's lessons of Napoleon and Wellington were well learned and the final battle of the movie is ingenious. And Mexico ceded Texas to the US.  A small but important character, Jaun Sequin (played by the gifted Argentinean actor Jordi Molla of 'Second Skin' and 'Blow' fame) brings continuity and closure to this grand scale movie in an intimate way that makes us all once again stop and consider about the madness of war.

I liked the fact that they made a good faith effort to accurately depict the seige and battle, without fear or favor.

The only real inaccuracy I noted was that Emilio Echeverria was too old to play Santa Anna, who, if I recall correctly, was only about 42 when the battle took place.  (After being captured at San Jacinto and held for several years, Santa Anna returned to Mexico and had a long political career, including becoming president again.)

I loved the way Billy Bob Thornton played Davy Crockett as someone trying to live up to his own out-sized legend, but not always enjoying it.  I also liked the attention paid to Sam Houston and the depiction of the brief but decisive battle of San Jacinto.  Everyone remembers the Alamo, but not many remember that Houston won the war by refusing to be drawn into a battle prematurely.

2080401,5,B0002DRDCS,"If you want history, read some books. Let's get that out of the way first. There are many fine histories written on the battle of the Alamo, and disputing ideas about what exactly happened there. It is likely that, like Custer's Last Stand, the exact story of what went down at the Alamo will still be disputed by historians long after we all are dead.
This movie is about mythology, not history. While the battle of the Alamo was a historical event, it long ago entered into the realm of American Myth. It is our Iliad. If we cannot win, this is how we want to die - not shirking our duty, but finding something heroic inside ourselves to rise to the occasion. That was portrayed well in this film. The principle players, Bowie, Crockett, and Travis, are not born heroes here. Instead, they are strong men with flaws and quirks of character like all the rest of us. When they are confronted by crisis, we see them rise beyond their flaws, their doubts, even their fears, and in their last moments truly become the heroes of the legend. This was captured powerfully in this film.
An early scene shows Sam Houston speaking to Davy Crockett about Texas at a ball in Washington, near the end of Crockett's term in congress. Seeing the two together, an observer whispers to another man that either of those two might once have had a chance to be president, but no more. It is a nicely done scene accomplishing several things at once. First it allows us to see the two as men who had risen to a certain level of success and power, with some reason to expect more to come. It then shows us that before the fighting in Texas, both were men whose star was in decline, and who may have faded out of history had they not cast their lot with the Texicans. Finally, it establishes from the beginning that Davy Crockett was more than a coonskin hat-wearing cliche hero, and prepares us to see him played as a fully dimensional character. This is just one example out of many of how efficient and well made this movie is.
The whole cast did a great job with their roles, but I thought that Billy Bob Thornton as Crockett delivered a particularly outstanding performance; one of the best of his career.  The role gave him many opportunities to shine, and he rose to the occasion. Chills ran down my spine when his Crockett stood like a chuckling Prometheus to answer the murderous music of the Deguello with his defiant fiddle. And in his death scene, he created a powerful alternative take on how a hero can die. Though it is one of the most controversial scenes of the film, I believe any man could be proud if they were able to meet death with such courage and defiant humor.
The film has some flaws - much was edited out, and it leaves the story and character of Dennis Quaid's Sam Houston feeling choppy and incomplete. But taken as a whole, this is a powerful new take on a great American legend, not replacing, but adding to what went before. It has many layers and much nuance, and is a film which bears seeing more than once to take everything in. While not perfect, I can't give four and a half stars, so I give it five.

2080402,4,B0002DRDCS,"While not perfect, this is easily the best depiction of the battle of the Alamo yet on film. Some reviewers have complained that the movie was slow, but it actually moves along quite well, unless you're comparing it with some slam-bang action flick, especially given what the filmmakers had to work with -- a 13-day siege with a short, pitched fight at the very end.

 Historically, the Alamo battle part of the film is mostly quite good. My quibbles: The script keeps Travis alive a little too long (most historians think he was probably one of the very first people to die near the start of the battle), the film sticks with the somewhat dubious legend of Bowie going down fighting even from his sickbed (but, hey, it makes for a darn good scene even if it's probably not true), and while it was brave of the moviemakers to tackle the how-Davy-Crockett-died controversy, this movie's depiction of him being the lone person left standing at that stage seems pretty unlikely.

 One of the truly great things about the film is its marvelous reconstruction of the 1836 Alamo -- with one glaring exception -- and colonial-era San Antonio. Shooting the movie in the Texas Hill Country really paid off, because the landscape looks vastly more like old San Antonio than the semi-desert plains of Brackettville, TX, where John Wayne's old ""Alamo"" was shot. The topography in the movie isn't an absolutely perfect match for the actual Alamo site -- among other things, it's a bit too hilly too close to the movie's Alamo -- but you certainly can't come away from this movie mistakenly thinking the Alamo was out in the middle of some desert, the way John Wayne's version makes it appear.

 The reconstruction of 1830s San Antonio is exceptionally good, and you can tell that they actually built the city sets rather than just generating it all as computer graphics. The reconstruction of Alamo compound itself mostly is quite good, with one huge exception. To make the old chapel (pretty much the only part of the original compound still standing in modern San Antonio) more visible, the movie shifts that entire building forward by at least a dozen yards, so that it sits exactly even with the convento/Long Barracks to its left. If you've ever visited the real Alamo, this hits a slightly weird note since almost as soon as you see the chapel sitting cheek-to-cheek with the Long Barracks, you're aware that something is wrong with it, but it's a subtle enough shift that it takes a while to figure out just what exactly is off about it. I also guess some Alamo experts might quibble about the exact way the compound's north wall is shored up, but it looked pretty reasonable to me, plus it was just nice that the filmmakers bothered to show the wall as being shored up. (I can't remember if the John Wayne version showed the north wall as being reinforced with logs?)

 All that being said, this movie does botch the battle of San Jacinto, which is its finale. The whole reason for that victory -- the Texans striking a poorly prepared Mexican encampment -- is sorely misrepresented. San Jacinto is only a very small part of the movie, but it's still disappointing since the rest of the film tries so hard to be at least reasonably accurate.

 All in all, I thought this was at least a 4-star movie. However, I doubt that I'll buy this DVD, rather than just rent it. Instead, I want a 2-disc version. It's been widely reported that ""The Alamo"" was drastically cut before its theatrical release (in particular, I understand that most of its scenes on Anglo Texian/Latino Tejano relations got cut out), and my impression is that this version offers only a few short deleted scenes on it. So I'm holding out for a full-blown ""director's cut"" edition so the story can be seen the way it really was intended to be.",1096070400,6,3804,4.681137724550898

2080405,5,B0002DRDCS,"i've been an Alamo fan all my life, so i was stoked to hear a new alamo movie was being brought to the big screen.

first time i saw it, i have to admit i had mixed feelings. on a 10 point scale, i gave it about a 7.5, but after seeing it a second and even a third, i give it a 10 and two very enthusiastic thumbs up.

this is the first alamo movie to actually portray the big three in a more true to life fashision. for once, Travis, Crockett, and Bowie seemed more life like and more humane and you got the sense that these were real people living in extraordinary times.

Billy Bob Thorton should get every award possible for his portrayal as Davy Crockett. He seems caught in the middle between living up to his name and just being himself and for once, he seems human. you finally get the sense that Crockett came to Texas more for political reasons than to fight in the Alamo. and not that it diminishes his legend one bit, but it puts everything into perspective.

Travis can't seem to step out of the shadow of Jim Bowie and Bowie is haunted over the loss of his house and his wife. I thought Hancock did a good job of also showing the cruelty and yet the sense of humanity on the Mexican side at the same time never losing track of the real story, the fight between two sides who fought for what they truly believed in.

there are also some real moving parts in the film which include the Travis speech to the men in the Alamo, Crockett's last stand and his execution, but the movie moment for me is the Harmony scene with Crockett playing the fiddle to the Deguello.

it's a real tear jerker scene.

only major problem i had with the movie was the whole San Jacinto episode. the movie at that part felt like Pearl Harbor, when a whole other hour and new battle was added to the movie.

i think for the most part the whole San Jacinto part could have been left out. like somebody once said, once the monster dies, the movie is over.

overall, i gave The Alamo a 10. it's a GREAT movie and has some real touching, moving, tear jerker scenes. the characters portrayed are about as true to life as you can get, and watching Billy Bob in the bucksin uniform and the hat really opened your eyes.

i can promise to you that for a moment, i saw the real Davy Crockett on the big screen.",1092700800,6,2288,4.179545454545455
2080406,4,B0002DRDCS,"As a Texan of Mexican background.. I saw the  1960 Alamo with John Wayne and I also saw this new version. Funny both films bombed.. one becuase it was historically incorrect(1960) and the other becuase no one outside of TEXAS  could care less. Like the earlier film Pearl Harbor.. it was too much pro american, but at least that one gave a  good view on both sides.

I also think it should have been rated R and give us a real in your face feel for the what these men  were going thru.. like Saving Private Ryan.  As a mexican I got not enough insight on what was the real purpose behind the attack and the actor who played Santa Anna was too old.. poor casting did not help and what happened to the Massacre of Goliad soon after the fall of the Alamo. The battle of San Jacinto was poorly staged. In closing if your gonna do a historical movie.. at least get some facts and then make a good story around it. Get the point early and stage the battle scenes properly..Hope the DVD is better..",1092528000,7,991,4.24468085106383
2080407,4,B0002DRDCS,"The ""Alamo"" is the latest attempt by Hollywood to bring the spirit of the siege against this military fortress back in the early 1800's to the big screen. Most everyone is familiar with the story of the Alamo, and this movie remains pretty close to accurate in its plot and storyline.

What stands out most in this movie is the performance by Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett- the Tennessee congressman and explorer/frontiersman who went to the Alamo to help safeguard it against attack. Thornton is completely believable in the role, and his occasional humor provides the only funny moments in this dramatic picture.

I liked Emilio Echevarria in the role as Mexican general Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana. His characterization really exemplified the traits that this military leader was known for: arrogance, pompousness, brutality, and miscalculation. I'm not so sure about Dennis Quaid, however, in the role as Sam Houston. Quaid seemed much too serious and his Houston character was void of much personality. The same could be said of the other actors in the film.

Some parts of this movie move a little too slowly, but I still enjoyed this movie. If nothing else, I recommend watching it just to see Billy Bob Thornton's role as Davy Crockett. Thornton, with his unique personality and the ornery look he gets from time to time (like when playing his fiddle), makes this movie worth a look.",1091750400,4,1396,4.906779661016949
2080408,5,B0002DRDCS,"I saw this movie when it first came out on the big screen and loved it.

The Good-

- As historically accurate as history allows.

- Portrays the charactors on a more human level.

- Great battle scenes for a PG-13 movie.

- Billy Bob Thornton played a wonderful Crockett, who is trying to live down the legend surrounding him.

- Patric Wilson plays a powerful William Barret Travis, a man who has had a very troubled life already at the age of 26 and put in charge of 185 men.

- Jason Patric doesn't get much screen time since he's lying down  sick in over half the movie, but he is in one of the most emotional scenes in the movie.

Now its finally time for the bad-

- Dennis Quaid,who plays Houston, looks like he's straining to get a terd out of his rear through half the movie.

- I didn't really feel anything for any of the not so important charactors, unlike the Wayne version where everybody felt important.

Overall this is a very good movie, that captures the emotion of what the men in the Alamo faced on March 6,1836.",1091491200,4,1033,4.268041237113402
2080409,5,B0002DRDCS,"Having finally seen The Alamo on the big-screen here in England, I can truthfully say it was well-worth the wait. After having read both the novel, which was apparently based on the original screenplay (before all the severe editing) and the making of the film book, which also contains the finished screenplay, I was both shocked and disappointed at just how severely the film was edited before release. Being an American living in England, I have talked to several people who are totally unfamiliar with The Alamo and it's history. My wife, who is British, is one of those people. She went to see the film with me and I had to explain early on in the film just what was happening and why. The filmmakers seemed to assume that anyone who saw the film would be well familiar with the story. They really needed to explain a little more at the start of the film. Yet, despite all of these shortcomings, the central story remains strong, backed up by the sterling and Oscar-worthy performance of Billy Bob Thornton as Crockett and by some spectacular and harrowingly realistic battle scenes. The photography and the music are also first-rate. Patrick Wilson was also excellent as Travis, despite some bad reviews of his performance. Jason Patric had a thankless role as the mostly bed-ridden Bowie. Although Bowie is portrayed as a drunk, he was also supposed to have consumption (tuberculosis). Like Doc Holliday, perhaps he drank mainly to help cope with the ravages of the illness? I look forward to the DVD release and seeing the deleted scenes and hopefully, one day, the DVD release of the definitive Director's Cut. In the meantime, I can highly recommend the film just as it is. Having now received my copy of the DVD, I am somewhat disappointed by the deleted scenes. I look forward to hopefully seeing all of the other missing scenes someday.",1091145600,,1849,4.78125
2080410,5,B0002DRDCS,"This is the DVD to buy.  A story of brave men who fought and died for something bigger than them- Texas.  Billy Bob Thorton's performance as Crockett deserves an Oscar nomination and the rest of the cast did a very good job.  Real battle scenes and memorable lines push this movie into an instant classic and worthy of being a Best Picture nomintation at next year's Oscars.  Besides The Passion of the Christ, name me one movie that is worth being Best Picture.  This DVD will be a great one and to have and recommend it to everyone who loves a story about fighting for freedom and to anyone who loves movies.  This is the true story of The Alamo!",1090627200,,648,4.358333333333333
2080411,5,B0002DRDCS,"Here is a movie that was done with forethought and care. Billy Bob's Crockett is memorable on all levels. Michael Corenblith's set should be perserved like the Wayne set in Brackettville. It's more a film about people than a battle. The history is almost the backdrop for the transitions of the characters. For the first time there is a real feeling of siege. Only Disney's  Davy Crockett came any where close to that feeling of ""waiting"".
This film will grow in prestige and will be regarded as a truly classic film as the years go by.",1090108800,,536,4.583333333333333
2080412,5,B0002DRDCS,"After reading some of the reviews, it is clear that some of you do not understand ""The Alamo.""  First of all, it is NOT a REMAKE of the John Wayne version (Now fondly referred to as the WAYNEAMO).  Even though the title is the same, it is in reference to the Shrine of Texasand the events that took place there, not a previous film.  This movie stands on its own merit.  Saying the Alamo is a remake of the Wayne version, is like saying that ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a remake of ""The Longest Day"" or ""D-Day, the 6th of June.""  Another reviewer was trying to figure out Santa Anna's age.  He was 42 to be exact.  While this movie was as Hollywoodian as any true story, it is probably closer to the truth than any other Alamo movie (and Wayne's was not the only one).  Kudos to those who recognize the character flaws of the real ""Three"" as portrayed in the film, and not the happy-go-lucky or flamboyant attitudes as portrayed in the Wayneamo.  This movie is certainly historically accurate in that sense.  The weather conditions were accurate, and the time of the morning the battle began was accurate.  With this movie you got a sort of feel as to what took place.  But the big question still is:  Did Crockett die fighting or did he surrender and was executed.  Look at the movie again.  Hancock settled this by having Crockett die ""Twice.""  Once, when he and three others were in the Alamo chapel at the end of the battle, and they rushed head-long into a swarm of Mexican soldiers.  While you did not actually see Crockett ""die"" in that scene, the message was quite clear.  Then there is the Screamer scene.  Crockett was a frontiersman and a statesman.  But he was human.  And I believe this movie portrayed him as he really was.  So it would not surpirse me if the real DAVID CROCKETT demanded the surrender of the Mexican army, knowing full well he was going to be executed (and by the way, did anyone actually see him die in that scene!  Just a swarm of Mexican soldados swarming over him with their bayonets after Santa Anna ordered his execution).  But the truth is, we will never really know what actually took place at The Alamo.",1089936000,2,2141,4.4447300771208225
