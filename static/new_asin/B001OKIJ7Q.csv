8330756,4,B001OKIJ7Q,"`Moon Over Hong Kong' is a vacation (much needed)  from the norm. This soft core James Bondish fantasy has a hot tale, hotter dialogue, and the hottest men around. So the acting is amusingly on the cheesy side (I am certain it was done intentionally), Personally- I like my videos of the hardcore taste, but even without the explicit sex, I found myself extremely aroused. What I enjoy about the Toby Ross videos is they use actual local establishments, making it easier to relate to the videos. The main actor, Johnny Carvajal, fights his way through this espionage saga with a sexy smug, I wish he had a few more expressions, but no doubt that body is enough to cream over. Overall, good pick for a late night stay in and a mood elevator for sure!  This is a tease encased in a ""camp concept"". My favorite line ""One day you might find yourself in Iran with your d*ck up some Mullah's *ss, and next day you will be s*cking on Kim Jon Il, are you ready for this mission?""
answer ""I know the score""

Enjoy all you secret agents out there ;)",1293580800,3,1039,4.373056994818653
8330757,1,B001OKIJ7Q,"I really love movies that are good because they are bad but, this is simply a bad film all around. The actors seemed too into themselves to even act poorly. The dialog was not cheesy or outrageous enough. The lines were not delivered in an extreme or zany way. If I'm watching an action film like ""Transformers"", then I'm not expecting great acting, but I can at least hope the action scenes are good(not saying that's what I got). This is how bad films that are good for being bad should be rated. I really only thought this film would be good because I thought Marlone Star would have some sexy scenes it it. I was honestly expecting the sex scenes to be better than the plot, but this was not like one of Bruce LaBruce's earlier films. And even his films have become pointless. There's no point in expecting good erotic sex, or anything else.",1273536000,,845,4.423076923076923
8330758,5,B001OKIJ7Q,"While the vast majority of gay film and television is saturated with typical cliche, finger-snapping stereotypes, 'Moon Over Hong Kong' offers an alternative. As sexy as the guys are (I'll get more detailed about that toward the end of the review), the humor and script is just as great!  The dialogue is hilarious and way over the top! I don't want to give too much away as I don't want to offer any spoilers, but I will say this: If you're behind Peter Michaels, you better watch out! ...you'll have to buy or watch the DVD to understand.

There's nothing typical about this film. When you watch it be ready to leave everything you've been conditioned to expect from majority gay films at the door... Be ready to laugh and expect TONS of surprises!

...As I promised in the beginning of the review I need to touch a bit on the actors! Peter Michaels does an amazing job as a smooth, tough, muscular and sexy military officer! Johnny Carvajal offers a memorable and cunning performance as a special forces agent who comes out of retirement. If masculine guys with a bit of hair on their face and chest is your type, you will love Johnny in this film! However, if you're like me and appreciate the darker-skinned men, you won't believe your eyes when Marlone Star hits the screen!

Here's the bottom line: Quirky script, Sexy men, tons of laughs!",1267920000,5,1346,4.595833333333333
8330759,5,B001OKIJ7Q,"Moon Over Hong Kong was great fun. Silly ? But of course. The music really added a lot and I was very mesmerized by Peter Michaels ( who plays the recruiting officer) and his persona. All and all this is super fun if you don't take this world and yourself too seriously. You do see quite a bit of Hong Kong and glimpses of New York in the rain. Then two night clubs a sleazy porn theater, streets, secret meeting places to hand over a secret assignment where the men are a bit more then meets the eye. It has a definite ""out of the box"" feeling and at the same time I sensed a desire by the film makers to borrow and steal as much from the traditional Hollywood spy genre as much as possible, this dichotomy of being an out of the box product and trying to borrow from the most traditional source and mix the two is to my opinion what gives Moon Over Hong Kong it's charm.",1261785600,4,872,4.105263157894737
8330760,1,B001OKIJ7Q,"Oh please. Did someone say this movie is watchable? OK, there are a couple of hot men. That's it. I wish I could say the writing is laughably bad. It's just bad. The acting is...well non-existant. A couple of the appearers can almost change their expressions, which I think is about the extent of their talents. Except of course in hard core porno. I'm sure there they would be great. They are good looking, have beautiful bodies and are impressively well-hung. But please, don't ask them to act. Don't let the so-called writer put fingers to keyboard again and do the world a favour[...]. Above all, don't buy this [...] thing. It really is unwatchable.",1261526400,2,654,4.695652173913044
