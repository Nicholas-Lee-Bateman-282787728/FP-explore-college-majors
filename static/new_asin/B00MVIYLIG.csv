6602579,4,B00MVIYLIG,"The acting is first class in this movie. It is not trying to be a gangster film. It is a poignant movie about an aging mobster who re enters the world after 20 years in prison.
 It is a huge adjustment to him and how much the world has changed around him. Highly recommended if you like a good yarn with excellent acting.",1416009600,2,321,4.095238095238095

6602581,4,B00MVIYLIG,"""You've been away a long time, quite a while, and things have changed."" Ex-mafia boss Joe Scoleri (Sorvino) has just been releases from prison after 20 years. He is forbidden to have any contact with his old associates and his only friend is his long time neighbor Bobby DiBianco (Rapaport). What starts off as happiness about being out soon changes for Joe and he finds things harder on the outside than he expected. I watch just about everything that comes out and I have to say that my favorite genre is the mafia genre. Any movie that deals with the mob to me is exciting and I look forward to all of them. This one did nothing to change my opinion. This one in fact may be the best one I have seen in a long time. The fact that Sorvino was in Goodfellas about 20 years ago playing a high ranking mob boss makes this one play almost like an unofficial sequel. This is a movie where I think there was a conscious choice to cast Sorvino hoping that the audience will remember him in Goodfellas. This is a movie that stays interesting the entire time and like most mob movies the main character is evil and mean but you can't help but root for him. The only real downside to this is that in terms of action not much happens but the movie does play almost like The Sopranos and that is fine with me. Overall, almost an unofficial sequel to Goodfellas. I really liked it and highly recommend this. I give this an A-.",1415577600,8,1415,4.303370786516854
6602582,1,B00MVIYLIG,"I so wanted to like this movie. But after the first 10 minutes, I had a feeling....I just didn't know I was in for complete letdown.

Sadly, the acting is sub-par. Some of the cast come off believable, many don't. How Rapaport gets all these Italian roles (he's not Italian) is beyond me. But he's consistent. He plays the same type of character, same delivery, same style in most of his movies. Not that that's a bad thing. Here, he just doesn't get enough support from the script - especially in the character development. Sorvino just walks through his lines and you can see it throughout. Notice how many time he looks directly at the camera as if to say, Are we cutting, are we doing another take, what are we doing Mr. Director? Sorvino is a heck of an actor and a great lead (especially for a movie about a mob boss on parole). But there's absolutely nothing in the script to garner any interest in the story line to bring a sense of intrigue, fascination, fear, or even sympathy for the character. It's just, blah and boring. Palminteri showed up for the paycheck and wisely got out after the deposit cleared. He literally is in one scene for a total of three minutes and thirty seconds. Yet he's billed with a head shot photo of almost equal proportion to Sorvino on the promo marketing material. Renee Props left no acting mark, other than the political norm and modernesque cliche', ""Dad, I'm gay"". The only character in the entire movie that was somewhat interesting was Lev Gorn; The single, solitary interesting character in the entire movie. He's the movie bad guy, the proverbial villain. Ultimately the fate of the lead character is in direct result of him. Guess what? He has a total screen time of five minutes...IN THE ENTIRE FILM! 5 minutes! You see where we're going here?

But the worst thing about this movie is it fails in every aspect of what a former mob boss parolee movie should be, and could have been.

Another reviewer states this to be ""almost an unofficial sequel to Goodfellas"". Martin Scorsese directed Goodfellas. He also directed Casino, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Mean Streets, and the list goes on. Scorsese is one of the preeminent directors of our time, and a master of the underworld crime genre. To compare this in any way to Goodfellas is absurd. Although it's apparent there's an attempt to pull that fan base, as they did me. I don't mean to badger the director (Dave Rodriguez) on this film. As I mentioned earlier, I really wanted to like this film. However, the director is also the writer so he's ultimately responsible. The storyline could have been fascinating, but it simply turned out futile. Ultimately, the writing sunk this flick.

The only thing somewhat convincing about this movie is that Sorvino at least shows up in a black 1985 Cadillac Eldorado Convertible in one of the last scenes. I mean, you can't have a mob flick without a Cadillac...Right? But, how did he get the car? Especially a rare car that GM only made 2200 of. The guy had no money, no connections anymore, only a daughter left for family, showed no signs of any wealth throughout the flick, and had to be hauled around everywhere he went throughout the movie because he didn't have a car. But a momentary scene shot through a doorway shows him pulling a flimsy car cover off this beauty  sitting outside. For the tail-end ""dramatic"" climax, he somehow shows up in this pricy and immaculate gloss black '85 Eldo Convertible? R-i-g-h-t. Crap David, at least show him unveiling this beauty in some garage, somewhere, as if after all these years he's going to unleash his inner, Don (mob slang). I mean, c'mon! You odiously made a choice to have him show up solo in the climax scene in the Cadillac for dramatic effect but did nothing to set it up? There's nothing else to the story, you at least could have played up that angle. It's not like you didn't have plenty of time to fill with all the holes in the script.

Yet in the final scene the lesbian daughter and her partner are pictured holding a little baby daughter. How nice. One big happy family and all is well.

Bottom line: This is a painfully boring low budget indie flick that should only air on Monday mornings on the Lifetime Channel. At 4:00 am.",1415404800,5,4236,4.602649006622516

6602588,3,B00MVIYLIG,"Absolutely riveting movie, in that you keep expecting *something* from the typical mafia movie repertoire to happen and it never does until the very end. I watched this movie during 2 lunch hours at work with my co-workers who are self-professed ""Mafia movie aficionados"" who kept anxiously waiting for someone to get ""whacked"" or for Mr. Joe (an absolutely spot on Paul Sorvino) to get pulled back into his old Mob Boss ways. I'm not going to ruin the movie for you, but safe to say that it's a more of a dramatic movie with a mafia background, than your typical mafia movie that you're used to.",1477353600,,596,4.579439252336448

6602592,2,B00MVIYLIG,"I don't know how they divide up the money I paid for this but they ought to give most of it to the guy that put together the trailer, which was far more entertaining and satisfying than the movie itself.  This is your standard fish out of water/man out of time story, which is a simple formula that the writers and director managed to foul up.  The writing and dialogue is downright painful at times.  Then there's the obligatory gay child/old fashioned father drama crappola in which the main character reacts badly to his daughter telling him she's gay, but then he changes his ways and lovingly accepts it.  It often seems as if at one time this was a straight forward story (badly written, to be sure) that someone required some social justice side  plot be jammed into.  Save your money.  Watch the trailer and you will be better entertained.",1461542400,2,847,4.569536423841059

I was expecting a crime\mob\action movie and didn't get any of those! Chazz Palmintieri should not be on the cover. He is in the movie for 5 minutes, literally,and never again. Don't be fooled by the cover or title, this is a slow, annoying movie that never picks up.

Mr. Joe has a heart condition and his days are numbered. He was trouble adjusting to the fact he is not in charge of people and his daughter who has come out to him.

An actual plausible, heart felt story about an aged mobster with morbid health issues living his final days on the streets he once controlled, which really aren't ""the streets"" at all anymore.  Sorvino and Rapaport deliver great performances.  Violence is used only sparingly.  This is a story about non connected people in a mobster's life.
 How much they care about him, and, eventually, why they should still fear him.  While Sorvino over-acts in some scenes, he's as convincing as ""Paul Cicero"" through most of the film.  The solid script helps this along.  He's just bigoted enough to reflect a mobster's archaic social views, yet just compassionate enough to know that they're wrong, and won't fly in today's world (then again, this is before Donald Trump becomes president).  Chaz Palminteri's role as mob lawyer is too small.  My guess is the tab ran a little too high for this obviously independent production to make his role larger.  This doesn't take away from the small budget film's charm, however.  Definitely worth a watch.",1496361600,3,1134,5.07027027027027
