8075561,4,B000A7D2DU,"This is a great concert video from 1985, taken from a show that Fats did at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles with Rick Nelson. It's too bad they split the show into 2 tapes that total less than an hour. Fats is great in his segment, though, with his top notch band featuring long time collaborators Dave Bartholomew and Herbert Hardesty. The biggest of the big hits are here - My Girl Josephine, Blue Monday, Ain't That a Shame, Blueberry Hill, I'm in Love Again, I Want to Walk You Home.",1472256000,,497,4.413043478260869
