7870649,3,6304429614,"O.k. sequel to previous Lost World movie with Rhys-Davies as Challenger, probably filmed back to back as the end credits mention characters from the first movie.  (Oddly, the music runs out before the final credits do.)  Belgium oil expedition disrupts native life and creates a volcanic flow on the plateau.  The team is sent a telegram to come at once and help.

Time period is confused as film opening says 1914 in title, and Malone reads his notes as July 1914 in India, but the telegram shows 1912.  When they meet Summerlee at his new institute, they mention being in America during Wilson's election, which would be fall 1912.

A bit of full rear female nudity is shown briefly in one scene.  The ending leaves two loose ends:  how do they get off the plateau after they've blown the tunnel; and what about the armed survivors of the Belgium crew?

A Canadian/British co-production filmed in Zimbabwe.",1379894400,,908,4.769230769230769

7870652,1,6304429614,"I can only assume the producers had some spare film left over, thought they might as well use it up, squeeze a few extra coins out of the franchise.  This is quite the worst excuse for a dinosaur film I can remember seeing.  The early scenes, involving a lump of rubber which is supposed to be an armoured dinosaur, should be enough to put anyone off.  If it isn't, then prepare to be bored.  Though the plot starts off interestingly enough, combining Conan Doyle's characters with eco-awareness, it soon descends into a tedious copy of its predecessor, with a far-too-large cast stranded in the lost world.  Virtually nothing happens for most of the film.  The dinosaurs are barely seen, but as the special effects are so lamentably bad, maybe that's for the best.  Once again, a well-cast Challenger and Summerlee are completely wasted.",1073174400,,838,4.818181818181818
7870653,1,6304429614,"Indeed, you probably have not heard of this movie before, but I must say it was definitely the most thrilling and entertaining I've seen my whole life. The acting by that guy in the blue is great and the dinosaurs are so real looking you will jump out of your chair ... in fright.
Despite it being made a few years before Jurrassic Park, I still think the quality is far superior. The plot is about two rival scientists set out for the Lost World and find it threatened with destruction by sinister oil prospectors. If you liked, or didn't liked, or even hated the Lost World or any movies about dinosaurs, you will no matter love this one! You will change your perspective on the cinematography of past movies, and will think that ""Lord of The Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"" was a graphically mediocre and suspenseless movie.",1029542400,,826,4.550335570469799
7870654,1,6304429614,"If anyone rates this movie 5 stars they must have a mental problem. These dinosaurs looked like they were just triangles and squares put together. Where have these people been latley everyone knows a T Rex doesn't look like a Lizard! Infact probably the only reason dinosaurs are in here is so that an oil company can kill them. Come on. The story line also has a serious problem. A group of explorers come to what is known as ""The lost world"" even though half the planet knows about it. Then the oil company disturbs a volcano and then some people die and a village gets saveed by the lava. BIG WHOOP! If just one building got burned that would be enough to get this up to 2 stars. So if you rent this video do the video store a favour and put it ina garbage despencer and through it in a fire pit. Infact they should have a ""Take at your own risk"" sign just for this movie.",1026345600,,875,4.183431952662722
