1730588,5,B000068WS9,"A great retrospective of Bob's five decades on television, starting in 1950 and going through the 90's.  This is a terrific 3 DVD set, featuring lots of extras that will bring back many memories.  The set also features many great guest stars, and almost serves of a ""who's who"" of celebrities for several generations.  The packaging is very deluxe too - it made a great gift for my Dad.",1069286400,20,386,4.565217391304348

1730623,1,B000068WS9,"I was expecting the FULL shows of Bob Hope performances.  Instead, I get specific clips picked by some Politically Correct committee of Hollyweird studio pinheads.  This STINKS!  Quality of video/audio is fine, but the content is a 1 on a 10 scale.  Don't waste your money.",1399334400,,273,4.869565217391305

1730626,5,B000068WS9,"This is one of the best Videos I've seen in a long time that had a varried collection of his work.  I especially cared about the Troop tours he made to the military sites.  You can tell by the faces of the soldiers as to how much it meant to them to get a visit/show by this great man and his troop of performers, yes of course they especially like having the beautiful women he had with him, but all in all it made a big difference to them beacause they had no real contact with the outside world or word from their families. Hope always seemed to come through for them and made personal message deliveries to quite a few guys.  Bravo for all who had a hand in making it possible for him to be able to visit them.  The other videos shows he and other great performers together in acts from the beginning of his career to the endof his life.  Seeing he and his personal family in these settings was fantastic as there wasn't much news about him in his later years. Good video to add to your all time favorites.",1365120000,,1010,4.158974358974359

I only will ever get one set of DVD's for any of the older comedians, and this was the one I tried for him.  It is very nice.
