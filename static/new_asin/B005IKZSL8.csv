8474791,4,B005IKZSL8,"An Italian drama ""The Jewel"" (""Il gioiellino"") centers on Ernesto Botta (Toni Servillo), a shrewd and aggressive CFO of a fictional family-run dairy and food corporation named Leda. The company needs to change its current style of marketing, but its ageing business owner Amanzio (Remo Girone) is reluctant to do so, sticking to the old ways of doing business. Also, with mismanagement and corruption taking their toll on company profits, Botta, fiercely loyal to the company (though he is not a member of the owner's family), has to raise finance for the business to keep afloat.

Probably inspired by the real-life scandal of Parmalat, ""The Jewel"" is most effective when capturing the cold atmosphere of the big company's office, where financial fraud is committed as a matter of mere convenience. The film's premise might remind us of ""Margin Call,"" but directed by Andrea Molaioli (""The Girl by the Lake""), the film is less like a thriller than a morality tale, with characters whose fates are all doomed in a different way: one desperately clinging to a fragile hope; one totally innocent of what is going on; and one trying to make the best with what he/she has got.

The only thing I didn't like about the otherwise convincing portrayal of the corporate scandal is the relationship between Botta and his secretary (and the business owner's niece) Laura (Sarah Felberbaum). Also, Botta's meeting with a bank manager (Jay O. Sanders in a cameo role) in New York is just unbelievable, even though it is made with dry sense of humor.

""The Jewel"" is best enjoyed as a factionalized account of one of the biggest frauds in Europe, described with the director's observant eye for characters and their self-deception.",1358640000,5,1717,4.975609756097561
