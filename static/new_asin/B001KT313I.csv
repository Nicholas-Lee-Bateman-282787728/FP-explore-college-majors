8564780,5,B001KT313I,I had the chance hear Marcia Whitehead this past week and see some of this film.  She is an amazing woman with a story as powerful as her voice.  The film tells the story of her pursuit of a passion to sing and the sacrifice it sometimes takes to do what you are born to do.  You can read a bit more about it at LaundryandTosca dot com or her own website marciawhiteheadusa dot com.,1347408000,,382,4.066666666666666
