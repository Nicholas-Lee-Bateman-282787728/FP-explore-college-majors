8204739,2,B000S8CLP6,"Very disappointed actually....trying to finish watch the second half....lost interest from the first part. Seems long to reach the climax of the story of individual themes. In Part 1, could tell the actors seemed as if they were REALLY acting their role...not as natural. I was so hoping this would be one of those heart felt black movies....but my interest has gone. I am actually in part 2 now, where Pastor Jones has been preaching for a long time, (for a movie). Also, this is supposed to be on a different day/different sermon, yet still the mom and sisters are in the same clothes from another day(scene)....interesting.
Anyway, well done, for producing a movie!",1387152000,,668,4.868421052631579

8204741,4,B000S8CLP6,An intresting story plot. I enjoyed the double movie on DVD. It does have its twist. A great message in Pastor Jones movies. Its low budget film but plot is so intresting i cant take my eyes off the screen. I have 5 movies from the collection already and Im never disappointed so far.,1358640000,,284,4.277777777777778
8204742,4,B000S8CLP6,I didn't expect much when i got this. its a cute story. it's ok. Can't say much for the film quality but the one in the red dress on the cover was pretty good compared to the other actors.,1332374400,,188,3.8461538461538463
8204743,1,B000S8CLP6,"This movie was so predictable that it was funny.  My Husband & I purchased 1&2 for what was supposed to be a tame movie evening.  It was so tame that I almost fell asleep.  Wearing a T-shirt with the name of your production company in a movie scene - T-A-C-K-Y.  Please spend a bit more $$ next time and stay BEHIND the camera.  The young pastors role was not believable at all....

Thank goodness I didn't break the seal on #2....I was able to return it as a result",1289260800,,466,4.179775280898877
8204744,5,B000S8CLP6,"I received this product in a timely manner, in excellent condition. The movie quality was excellent. No scratches. I really enjoyed Pastor Jones Sister In Spirit. The dialog was wonderful. I really enjoyed the story line, and Pastor Jones is one of my favorites.",1254700800,,262,4.9772727272727275
8204745,1,B000S8CLP6,"Too predictable.  Boring to me.  Is there a part 2 or is that's it?  If I had to do it all over again I would not buy it, seen better movies on TV.  However, did enjoy the other show, Pastor Jones Save My Daughter.",1220227200,,214,3.7954545454545454
