4070234,5,B0035ECHVI,"Whenever I'm asked what my favorite Godard film is, I always receive funny looks when I tell them Vivre Sa Vie. I know it's not as energetic as his earlier films like Breathless and Band Of Outsiders, but it is one of the only truly touching films Godard ever made. Watching Vivre Sa Vie is like a cinematic awakening. This film has a lot of heart. Nothing about the soul of the film is staged in any way, the soul of the film is defined by its own constantly evolving personality which makes the emotional toll of watching Vivre Sa Vie wholly organic and very real. Its as if we are watching a film being born out of an idea, we watch the film have fun with its new found life, and we watch how it all ends. A clever metaphor for the life creative people give to inanimate objects, and for the passion that is ultimately lost on them. Godard never tries to force this one on you. Godard has split the film into twelve different tableaux in order to tell his story, a device that has been borrowed and used time and time again. The most important thing about Vivre Sa Vie is that Anna Karina's best performance can be found here as a prostitute in 1960s France. Karina is astonishingly good in Vivre Sa Vie. Without a doubt the finest film Godard and Karina ever worked on together.

Rather than go over the entire film and all of the ideas and statements Godard makes with it, which would take forever, I'll simply talk about one scene in particular that has since been branded into my heart.

It takes place in a movie theater. Anna Karina is watching Carl Theodor Dreyer's silent masterpiece The Passion Of Joan Of Arc, and begins to weep. We watch as she connects deeply with a film, and we in turn are affected by it as we are reminded of how moving a great film can really be. The entire sequence is breathtaking. One of the most touching things Godard ever filmed. This isn't to say that Godard is not a heartfelt filmmaker, there are personal moments in most of Godard's films, but sometimes he strives more of an artist than a human filmmaker. Here, in Vivre Sa Vie, the soul of the filmmaker can be found in all of its compounding sentimentality.

This scene means so much to me because never has the act of investing yourself emotionally in a film been explored to such a startling result. Anna Karina watches the film in tears, and she looks incredibly wondrous and innocent. Watching films can be a beautiful experience. Vivre Sa Vie demonstrates that wonderfully.",1369008000,,2477,4.4635761589403975
4070235,5,B0035ECHVI,The tragic story of a beautiful young French woman who works in a record store near the Arch of Triumph but as in the case of many jobs in Paris-France the job pays next to nothing and she is forced into prostitution.  Many cases were like that in Paris at the time.  This movie is not really fictional,1359849600,,302,4.189655172413793

4070237,5,B0035ECHVI,"This is probably one of the best movies I've seen in over 20 years.  Anna Karina is absolutely gorgeous and amazing as a woman just trying to stay alive, to live her own life.  She is so breathtakeingly beautiful, she could be Angelina Jolie's mother.  Most definately one of Godard's best works.  The ending blew me away!",1352764800,,322,4.5964912280701755
4070238,5,B0035ECHVI,"I cannot imagine anyone seeing this movie and ever being able to forget it.  The director examines a life (Nana) and offers 12 discrete episodes that jump in time. Taken together, they paint Nana's gradual descent into prostitution...when she runs out of money and loses her dream of becoming an actress.

The movie begins with the camera focused on the back of the woman's head, with her face (only) reflected in the mirror.  She talks to the mirror, not to her boyfriend beside her, about the pain of the breakup.  Another episode involves her being in the audience at a movie theater showing another movie on screen: Carl Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"".  In this episode, Nana silently weeps.  (Not coincidentally, Joan of Arc was punished by men for trying to act as one).  Then there is the episode where Nana casually allows a man to make love to her for money. This is the first instance she trades sex for money.  It is pertinent she resists the man's desperate efforts to kiss her on the mouth.  Soon afterwards, there is a scene where a man embraces her in a hotel room while she looks away, all the while emotionally distant - smoking her cigarette.

A very powerful episode is one where she dances around a pool table listening to jukebox music - it's a very famous part of the movie.  This will be the first...and only time that we glimpse a smile on Nana's face.(Of course, that dance reminds one of her dance in Godard's film ""Band of Outsiders""). The tragedy of Nana's life is that bad luck has taken away all her potential for happiness. Ultimately, ""Vivre Sa Vie"" proceeds towards the inevitable climax when her pimp tries to sell her off to another pimp, as simple chattel.

Three matters stick most in my mind about the film. First, the story of prostitution is displayed on the screen without any touch of sentiment or fun.  There is no ""Pretty Woman"" nonsense here.  Second, Anna Karina is a radiant actress...and we understand immediately how quickly the director must have fallen in love with her.  (They were married at the time of the filming). Third, was the ending in which the camera itself looks down at the sidewalk, almost ashamed of the way this human life is being treated.

It is a masterpiece of neorealism, a film that is enhanced by the understated acting of the lead actress.",1344384000,6,2321,4.624390243902439
4070239,5,B0035ECHVI,"A fan of Godard's work, I had seen excerpts and the trailer on YouTube, which finally impelled me to buy this Blu-Ray disc.  I love this film on many levels.

Primarily, I wanted to see the Paris of 1962 again, the Paris of my first visit as a child, to smell the Gitanes and Gauloises, to see the people, the caf&eacute;s, the streets; the true Paris before it became an imitation of itself.  I still love Paris, and am conscious of some of the less positive changes, but choose to ignore them (as much as possible).  I mention this because Paris is very much a character in the film and is the page upon which the story has been written.  People who knew Paris in earlier years will especially appreciate it.  There is even a great shot of people standing in line for Truffaut's ""Jules et Jim"".  Shots like that give it somewhat a documentary feel, of being there in the present; and also it is somewhat of a time capsule of life in that time and place.

Secondly, I of course love Anna Karina who is incredibly beautiful and has such a lovely inner quality, plus her Danish accent drives French guys like me crazy (lol).  But when you see the filmed interview that comes with the disc, you will see how different she is in ""real life"" and appreciate even more her work as an actress, even if the character of Nana was a co-creation with Godard.  I wanted to see her in this film also because she was not yet really a big star, and I find there is less self-awareness in performance in the early part of a career, which is more interesting to watch.

Thirdly, I love the way Godard explores new ways of telling a story on film.  This was the type of film-making that inspired me in film school, and there are so many lessons one can learn from him.  I find watching his work really can open up one's mind, inspire creativity, and help one think outside the box.  So many films today seem very packaged and formulaic, so Godard for me is particularly refreshing.  Only 83 minutes long, this film seems to have more in it than some major epics.

The opening of the film looks a bit grainy, perhaps because of the low light exposure, and I wondered if the blu-ray made an appreciable difference in definition, but as the film continued I saw that the blu-ray does add to the clarity and was worth getting.

The story itself is tragic, so be prepared for that, even if there are some wonderful lighter moments.  One's heart breaks for all the Nana's who have met the same fate, but even so, Nana takes full responsibility for her actions.  Godard asserts that she was able to ""keep her soul"", but I doubt this is often true in real life.  In any case, it is refreshing to see a film from a time when one could have a 10-minute philosophical discussion on film, which I think would not really even be possible in France today.  Don't expect to be titillated though, and I greatly admire Godard for this, especially with the subject matter.  Today everything would unfortunately have to be very graphic, but Nana never is shown in more than the beginning stages of undress or finishing dressing.  There are a few nudes in one scene, but each is more like a brief ""still life"".  As a result, the sordidness of the ""profession""  becomes very real and believable, and for me it is proof that in film too, less is more.

There are a few nice extras, such as the interviews with Karina, and film prof Jean Narboni.  And there is an interesting documentary about prostitution in Paris at that time, including an interview with the author of the work upon which the film is based. I would have liked to have an interview with Godard from the period, but it is not on this disc.  The film however is itself very telling about Godard and his feelings about filming Karina, his wife at that time; feelings he expresses in a voice-over reading of the ""Oval Portrait"" by Poe, a story of an artist and his muse.  ""Vivre Sa Vie"" is very much such a story.",1326499200,8,3937,4.406639004149378
4070240,5,B0035ECHVI,"I am a huge Jean-Luc Godard fan, and, of his films, ""Vivre Sa Vie"" (My Life To Live) is my favorite. It's hard to  imagine watching this movie any other way than on Blu-Ray. It is just EXTRAORDINARY.",1315094400,,199,4.2368421052631575
4070241,4,B0035ECHVI,"It was 1962 and Jean-Luc Godard and wife, Anna Karina have worked on two films together ""Le petit Soldat"" (created in 1960 but released in 1963 due to the film being banned) and the 1961 film ""Une femme est une femme"" (A Woman is a Woman).  By that time, both Godard and Karina's marriage life became a public spectacle especially rumors that their marriage was on the rocks.

Despite their rocky personal life, Godard's goal was to make Karina a serious actress and in 1962, he began working on his screen adaptation of ""Vivre sa vie"" (My Life to Love) which utilizes the studies of prostitution from ""O en est la prostitution"" by Marcel Sacotte.  But Godard would have his most challenging directorial experience at the time when funding for the film was turned down and the budget for the film was 400,000 francs, less that ""Breathless"" and it would be the first film in which Godard would be co-producer (putting half of his money towards the film) alongside producer Pierre Braunberger.

""Vivre sa vie"" would create the film in 13 sequences, Godard called it ""tableaux vivants"" (live paintings) which was inspired by the 1931 film ""The Threepenny Opera"" (directed by Georg Wilhelm Pabst) and the film was shown at the Venice Film Festival in which the film received boos from the audience (because it was unlike his other films) and even received some critical pans by a few critics  but the film would go on to receive the Critics' Prize and the Special Jury Prize and those same critics that panned the film earlier, some would go back and watch it again and at this point, many proclaimed the film as Godard's masterpiece, even receiving praise from director/friend (at the time) Francois Truffaut and would be the first film for Godard to end the year in Cahiers du Cinema best ten list for that year.

VIDEO:

""Vivre sa vie"" is presented in 1:33:1 aspect ratio and in black and white.  For many years, many people had only a VHS  and import DVD to watch ""Vivre sa vie"".  And now people have the chance to watch Godard's tragic masterpiece in HD.  Detail is much more evident in the backgrounds, you can see the surfaces of the signs and the walls, detail on the stains of the walls to the detail in Karina's clothing.  Blacks are nice and deep, grays and whites and the overall contrast levels look fantastic.  There is a good amount of grain tot he film and for the most part, this is the most detailed version of ""Vivre Sa Vie"" available on any physical media at this time.

According to the Criterion Collection, the picture has been slightly windowboxed to ensure that the maximum image is visible on all monitors. The new HD digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from teh original 35mm camera negative.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system and Pixel Farm's PFClean system, while Digital Vision's DVNR system was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Vivre Sa Vie"" is presented in Monaural French with English subtitles.  Audio is presented in LPCM 1.0 and according to the Criterion Collection, the soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the optical prints.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated audio workstation.

It's important to note that for this film, Godard went for an experimental use of sound.  That is the soundtrack (dialogue and noise) was recorded directly on a single track.  No sound editing, natural sounds and everything that one would hear in a regular conversation with another person is what you would hear in this film.  The only addition was the music to the live soundtrack during the post-production phase of the film.

Dialogue (as well as crowd ambiance) is clear and understandable and the bass line for the main theme song (especially during the dance sequences) sound very good in HD.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For any Godardite, let alone the Anna Karina fans not enjoy ""Vivre sa vie"".  I felt that the journey Godard has taken the viewers for the character Nana and her descent into prostitution was well done, there is no sugar coating the whole lifestyle of these women.  As Karina may be a woman who tries to maintain her soul despite being a prostitute, the only ending that I can foresee for this character was a tragic ending.  This was evident to me right when I saw the ""Joan of Arc"" film and Nana's face as she tearfully wept as Joan is to be put to death.

No sugar coating, no happy ending, no ""Pretty Woman"" type of ending, it is what it is.

""Vivre sa vie"" was a film that was a unique experience, especially having watched many of Godard's films and also having read about the personal turmoil that was going on behind-the-scenes with his marriage to his muse Anna Karina.

I look at ""Vivre sa vie"" as Godard trying to maintain his composure as a director and the audience, trying to make amends with his wife, Francois Truffaut, explain differences between ""Vivre sa vie"" and why ""A Woman is a Woman"" did not work but we also saw at the same time, the film alienating some Godardites and even upsetting his former friend/director Jean-Pierre Melville.

But as ""Breathless"" is seen as the flame that sparked the French New Wave and intellectual films, ""Vivre sa vie"" influenced cinema with lengthy dialogue which would become used by fellow directors and many young directors who were influenced by the film.  From the opening sequence of Nana and her husband, the camera shot is from behind, Godard wanted no distractions by showing the character's faces from the front but by the back.  The use of the tableux sequences and as mentioned, the dialogue sequences.  Where Rohmer made things much more intellectual in ""My Night at Maud's"", I can easily see why people criticized ""Vivre sa vie"" at first because of the dialogue was not as intellectual as they hoped for it to be.

Interesting to note, an interview is included in the book insert of how Godard wanted many people to understand his film (something that he would eventually get away from a few years later) and although Godard does read a passage from Edgar Allen Poe's book at the end of the film, the book that had any significance was ""Ou en est la prostitution"" by Marcel Sacotte.  The tricks of the trade in which Nana and her new pimp Raoul begin discussing and a way for Nana to make even more money.

But as the film does feature lengthy dialogue, not all were impressed, including one of Godard's earliest supporters Jean-Pierre Melville who was very critical towards him.  In fact, it was one of the major reasons that Godard and director Melville ended their friendship as according to Melville's wife Florence who recalled her husband telling Godard ""You are making a lazy man's cinema, this is no longer deserves the name of cinema, you put down the camera and you have people talk, nothing more.  For me, this isn't cinema"". (p. 141, ""Everything is Cinema"", Richard Brody) and in response Godard said, ""There can no longer be a friendship between us, if one doesn't like one's friend's film, no one can longer be his friend.""

But Godard received a good review from another earlier supporter, director Francois Truffaut who wrote ""There are films one can admire and yet that do not invite you to follow...why pursue it?  These are not the best films.  The best films open doors, they support our impression that cinema begins and begins again with them.  `Vivre sa vie' is one of those."" (p. 319, ""The Films In My Life"", Francois Truffaut)

So, the film received its boos but many people came around to declare the film as a Godard masterpiece.  But one thing I have always wondered was if there was an alternate ending to this classic Godard film.  If Godard had actually thought about another type of ending and the more I researched, I've read that Godard and Karina had a lengthy argument on how the film was supposed to end. Karina opposed the ending of the film and according to several books, because of the ending Godard chose, which went against his wife's wishes, it was the beginning of the breakup of their marriage (and another unfortunate incident involving Karina).

So, I've always found ""Vivre sa vie"" to be a unique Godard experience.  From Coutard's cinematography, Godard's use of the tableaux, Antonioni-like sequenes and the recording of the sound and ambiance from the actual filming and as much as I call this a Godard masterpiece, I've felt that Anna Karina was absolutely dashing in this film.  A role that gave the actress the depth she needed to showcase her emotional side and also her flirtatious side, needless to say, this is a film where Karina shined.

The Blu-ray release of ""Vivre sa vie"" is done quite well.  Not only do you get an informative commentary by film scholar Adrian Martin but the interview with film scholar Jean Narboni is also well-done and informative.  The other features are like icing on the cake, especially the hilarious interview with Anna Karina who is surprised by the questions asked by the interviewer and the 42-page booklet is a major plus.

Overall, ""Vivre sa vie"" is a release that many Godard fans have been waiting for (now all we need is ""Week End"") and the fact that The Criterion Collection also chose this film for Blu-ray release is fantastic.  Although ""Vivre sa vie"" is not my favorite Godard film (which still goes to ""Pierrot le fou""), ""Vivre sa vie"" is still a Godard masterpiece that is worth having in your cinema collection.

Definitely recommended!",1282003200,7,11508,4.803453529710513
4070242,5,B0035ECHVI,"My Life to Live is a highly stylized and extraordinarily unformulaic adaptation of a simple premise: a young woman, seeking the freedom and excitement of, what Federico Fellini calls La Dolce Vita, leaves her family to pursue an acting career, only to turn to a life of prostitution. From the opening sequence showing a detached, seemingly clinical exhibition of Anna Karina's face and profile, followed by an uneasy dialogue between Nana (Karina) and Paul (Andre-S. Labarthe) filmed at an angle showing the backs of their heads, we are introduced to the singular, iconoclastic vision that is Jean-Luc Godard. Stripped of expression and sentimentality, Godard, nevertheless, succeeds in creating a film that is visually stunning and full of pathos. We are drawn to Anna, not because of her seductive persona or compassionate actions, but because she is humanity, lost and desperate, incapable of comprehending her misery nor articulating her pain (Note the parallel character of Antonio Ricci in Vittorio de Sica's The Bicycle Thief.

Godard's revolutionary camerawork transcends nouvelle vague novelty: it serves as a cinematic extension of Nana's soul. The awkward angles and long panning shots during Nana and Paul's conversations reveals the underlying tension and emotional distance between them. Deeply affected (understandably) by Maria Falconetti's performance in Carl Theodor Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc, Nana's conversation proceeds in silent film intertitles - reflecting her own suffering and innate desire to achieve greatness and escape the banality of her sordid life. The seamless camerawork following Nana as she dances uninhibitedly around the billiard room feels intoxicating, almost mesmerizing - a fleeting glimpse of the few brief moments of pure joy she has ever known. My Life to Live is a truly remarkable film: a synthesis of artistic vision and moral tale, suffused with haunting melody, the ballad of a contemporary tragedy.",1271808000,29,1960,5.468646864686469

8388903,5,B0035ECHVI,"In the character of Nana Anna Karina explores Godard's thoughts and feelings about art, and how open-ended this precious gift is, in terms of articulation, whether through acting (Anna Karina), writing as Poe does, or Plato, or Hegel or Nietzsche. Godard does not define, or create a film as a lesson on life's hazards,  filled moral prescriptions , antidotes, hand-me-down phrases that only bring one closer to life, to Nature that is mortal and very destructive. (Witness te close of the film.)

Nietzsche says that art is not an imitation of nature at all, but is rather a metaphysical supplement, raised along side Nature only to overcome Nature. I agree. And Godard seems to be on this wavelength, but would never reveal it. Closeness to the world in art is not art for Godard. Distancing, almost barricading the self from the world in order to come towards it with assurance and strength represents the artistic nature overagainst the non-artistic mundane, so-called real world.

Nana tries to transcend a Paris that is unkind to her, manipulative, and very dangerous. She does in a way overcome, retreat from the closeness to the world as a prostitute. But this life is too insistent on ignorance, irrationality, sickness, and death to be liberating. Nana hasn't the strength to be the actress she desires to be, could be. She is too close to oblivion, the way art can be threatened by oblivion, as Godard shows as he explores the relation between being driven by matter, things, people and their bad faith, and driving against the forces that threaten to obliterate the mind and its memories.

Beautifully acted, Vivre Sa Vie is a major benchmark in the history of cinema..indeed art.",1464739200,2,1692,4.926315789473684

I studied at film school at the college and graduate school and want to make sure that all the movies metioned in the text books, I really don't dig them and most of all I never watch them again and again. Unless I have to draw storyboard or someting for my own film.
This movie was not (Maybe a few times but not often) mentioned in the text books that often.
From the moment when I saw this movie for the first time, I felt in love with this movie.
It was such a sad movie because of the ending. I just couldn't erase the image of the ending shot.
I never thought Anna Karina is beautiful till I saw a single shot from the facebook when she is calculating her height with her palm. That single shot made me want to buy the dvd.
Before that even though I liked this movie, I never wanted to own this in dvd.
I finally bought this dvd and saw it again last night.
Anna Karina's eyebrow, to be honest, kind of disturbed me in some reason. It looked fake. But who cares. She is just an actress. And many actresses have plastic surgery from a long time ago. What am a saying. boo.
Anyway, her style was more like imitational.
This movie is all about Anna and Anna only.
If I don't like her, then there's no meaning to watch this movie.
Oh, there is other reason to watch this movie too.
This movie has it's own way of framing and that was intersting to watch too.
It was Jean-Luc Godard's movie after all.
It was kind of sad that the aspect ratio was 4:3.  And was also mono.

8388907,5,B0035ECHVI,"VIVRE SA VIE was Jean-Luc Godard's fourth feature film. The protagonist Nana (Anna Karina) is a young Parisian woman who is not especially bright, but full of life and endowed with great beauty. Unable to make ends meet by working at a record shop, and unable to break into films as she dreams, she starts to work as a prostitute. Postwar French law permitted prostitution, with certain rules and regulations that the film explains in a documentary-like segment. Nana, who yearns to live her life according to her own desires, initially thinks that this new profession has set her free from cares. In fact, Nana's liberation from penury through prostitution only subjects her to new constraints imposed by her pimp and clientele. The film, divided into twelve tableaux with fade-to-black transitions that quicken as it goes on (which one commentator compares to breathing faster and faster) brings us to one of the most shocking endings I have ever seen.

This is a superlative film. Clocking in at 85 minutes, it lasts exactly as long as its story demands, with not a single moment that feels superfluous. Everything fits together, perfectly even things that ought to seem extraneous, the overindulgence of the auteur. Early in the film Nana goes to see Carl Dreyer's 1928 silent film ""La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc"", and this is not a mere gratuitous tribute to earlier cinema as is common in French New Wave films. Nana speaks with an elderly philosopher in a caf, who is in fact the real-life philosopher Brice Parain whose dialogue here consists of his own writings, and yet this is not shallow intellectualism. Rather, these scenes increase the three-dimensionality of Nana as a character: not very intelligent and with negligible education, an easy woman since long before the film begins, but feeling strongly that there must be more out there.

The believability of Nana as a character is increased all the more by Anna Karina's masterful performance. When coming to Godard's films, after the filmmaker has taken a beating from some circles, one might think that Karina was simply a beauty with no especial talent that enchanted the director due to her looks and foreign origin. Nope, the Danish actress here presents a completely believable Parisian airhead who is so easily moved by sentimental art.

Criterion has filled this DVD with some great supplementary features. The audio commentary track is by the delightfully Australian-accented film scholar Adrian Martin, and it draws one's attention to all kind of details that one might have never quite noticed. The major featurette is a video interview with the film scholar Jean Narboni that, again, expands one's appreciation of the film immensely. There is also a television interview from 1962 with Anna Karina and excerpts from a 1961 French television expos on prostitution.",1394236800,2,2839,5.074946466809422

Rather, these scenes increase the three-dimensionality of Nana as a character: not very intelligent and with negligible education, an easy woman since long before the film begins, but feeling strongly that there must be more out there.

The believability of Nana as a character is increased all the more by Anna Karina's masterful performance. When coming to Godard's films, after the filmmaker has taken a beating from some circles, one might think that Karina was simply a beauty with no especial talent that enchanted the director due to her looks and foreign origin. Nope, the Danish actress here presents a completely believable Parisian airhead who is so easily moved by sentimental art.

Criterion has filled this DVD with some great supplementary features. The audio commentary track is by the delightfully Australian-accented film scholar Adrian Martin, and it draws one's attention to all kind of details that one might have never quite noticed. The major featurette is a video interview with the film scholar Jean Narboni that, again, expands one's appreciation of the film immensely. There is also a television interview from 1962 with Anna Karina and excerpts from a 1961 French television expos on prostitution.",1394236800,,2839,5.074946466809422

Here's the deal, I've watched a lot of Godard's films recently, as I hadn't viewed them for a long time and I remembered them being cool. I watched Breathless, A Band Apart, Contempt and Vivre Sa Vie in the past week and if It wasn't for Contempt I would have to consider the notion that Godard the man is just another chauvinist Frenchmen. I thought Vivre Sa Vie was an opportunity to empower the lead character played by Karina. But she was, yet again, directed to play a pretty flower to be groped by French men. At first I thought Godard was making a statement. But one after another of his films from this era feels unconsciously misogynistic. Its easy to say his films are cool. But are they?  Only Contempt explored the notion that women just might be on the receiving end of a raw deal, particularly in France. (Sorry France, but you've got a crap reputation when it comes to sexism...it ain't the 70s anymore President Hollande and Gaston Strauss-Kahn...)

Of course, one has to remember the time and place when a piece of art or film is produced, but the true mark of great art is its timelessness. I find a lot of Godard's films just aren't so cool 50 years later. If the men in his films were cool back then, they feel a bit foolish now. A lot of his early films have pale slippery men who look a bit like toads, aggressively groping and bullying women against walls and in closets. (I lived in Paris for 6 months and heard countless stories about men exposing themselves to women on the metro - in fact caught a guy shaking hands with his little friend in front of a friend of mine in a crowded train.) Hell, even the lanky Belmondo looks a bit of a goof mugging and gawking around in Breathless. The women, by contrast, would still seem cool if they weren't directed to be pretty little things who are captive creatures to male salaciousness. I know people think Godard flicks are cool, but I'm just not sure about that anymore. I find the lead male characters a bit embarrassing, frankly.

I know, I suck. But go watch Antonioni if you want Euro cool films from the past that explore modern themes like alienation and still hold up today. Just saying...",1392768000,2,2306,4.457345971563981
