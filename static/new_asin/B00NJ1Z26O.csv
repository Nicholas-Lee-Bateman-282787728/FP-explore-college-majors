6657997,1,B00NJ1Z26O,Very little actual footage or pictures of the shooting.  :(,1422921600,2,59,4.9
6657998,4,B00NJ1Z26O,"It was free on Amazon Prime so I watched it.  It was pretty entertaining but I wouldn't pay money to watch this promo.  Pretty much everyone was entertaining and had good stories, except Jeff Cohen brought up residuals and plays lawyer the whole time he's on camera.  Way to live up to the stereotype..  It was also pretty obvious by his body language that he lied about pulling hair.",1422316800,,384,4.521739130434782
6657999,4,B00NJ1Z26O,"A great documentary if you liked ""The Goonies"" A great additional value if you are an Amazon Prime subscriber.",1422316800,,110,4.842105263157895
6658000,3,B00NJ1Z26O,"Would have been worth the price tag even if it is short documentary but with it being a cheap DVDR it isn't worth the price. It should have stated that it was a ""burn"" in the product description..",1420070400,2,196,4.184210526315789
6658001,2,B00NJ1Z26O,"The documentary itself, although short (around 24 minutes), is great.. But once it started I realized this was a documentary that I had seen a year or two ago on YouTube... Ok, then onto the ""extra interviews""... Which I had also seen on YouTube.  There are some interesting stories here for goonies fans that didn't fit into the context of the actual doc.  Ok, well I'm a collector so it'll be cool to have the dvd in my collection, right?  Oh wait, it's a DVDR with a inkjet printed label.

All that being said, the cover is nice and glossy.

If you are a goonies completist or have yet to see this doc, and don't mind paying for a DVDR with a printed label, definitely pick this up.

If you've seen this footage before, save your money and watch the film on YouTube.",1418169600,2,769,4.3426573426573425

6658010,4,B00NJ1Z26O,Too short! I was left wanting way more. I think this was a featurette from the 25 year anniversary DVD. But anything Goonies is Good! I know there is so much extra footage out there I wish this had everything in it.,1477958400,,215,4.142857142857143

6658039,3,B00NJ1Z26O,"It's Great that finally there's a Documentary made on the film the Goonies
one of my favourites i Grew up watching the film
but the interviews have been filmed by Independent company Jansen media
Definitelty not warner bros who owns the film, as if warners would make the effort to produce a retrospectve featurette
on the making of the film
so i bought this dvd out of curiousity to see if it's worth watching, not really worth it not for $10
well the Duration on the back cover says 90mins 2014 Jansen media
this is bulls*** it's Definitely not a 90min Doco, and the interviews were recorded back in 2010 not 2014
first of all, you get a 25min retrospective featurette with
Richard Donner, Jeff Cohen, Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, Robert Davi, Joe Pantoliano
Curtis Hanson, the mayor of Astoria from 1983 is interviewed and that's it
no interviews with Josh Brolin, Kerri Green or Martha Plimpton
and that's the credits roll and goes back to main menu where you select Bonus interviews which only goes for about 30mins
so it's a 55min Doco, not 90mins what Bulls***
the extra interviews are with the same people from the retrospective featurette
the extra interviews are mainly behind the scenes stories and about the Goonies fans etc
some of it is worth watching, some of it is just boring, as a big Goonies fan i was expecting more footage
more interviews with Josh brolin, Kerri Green or martha plimpton at least but no
this Doco is very independently made so maybe Jansen could not get all the actors from the film to be interviewed
the DVD is all regions so if you want a copy it's only worth $5 or less,
amazon are selling it for $10 which i think is ripoff based on the content you pay for.
about 2-3 stars for this dvd meaning it's average produced",1454889600,2,1756,4.542586750788644
6658040,3,B00NJ1Z26O,"Well, they interview some of the folks involved in the movie.  Not the worst thing I've ever watched, but I wouldn't get terribly excited about this either.",1454544000,,156,4.777777777777778

6658042,2,B00NJ1Z26O,Not what I had hoped.  Thought it would include the actors.  Just a brief appearance.,1454544000,,85,4.6
6658043,3,B00NJ1Z26O,Skims the surface of what millions saw as the ultimate adventure for kids who the world failed to listen too. Very short and missing a lot of the cast.,1454284800,,151,4.241379310344827

6658047,5,B00NJ1Z26O,Good bit of info from half of the actors and directors. I enjoyed this start to finish. It was like the bonus features for me without having the DVD or bluray,1453593600,,158,4.129032258064516

6658089,3,B00NJ1Z26O,"I live in Astoria, OR where ""The Goonies"" was filmed and every year, one of the biggest local festivals is ""Goonie Week"".  It is so amazing to see people come from all over the world to take part in it.  Though my kids loved it, I still have a hard time understanding the phenomenon of attachment to the movie.  I can be walking down to the grocery store, any time of the year, and have people stop me and ask me ""where is the Goonie house"".  In the summer, people pour into town to see the ""Goonie Museum"" and to go out on the pirate ship that comes down for the festival from Grays Harbor, WA, or take part in the re-enactments that the coordinators set up around town.  Though I don't really get the fame of the movie, it has been great for our little town.  So, thanks to all of you from the ""Goonies' cast and crew for filming it here in our wonderful little town.  Oh, and by the way, it is fun to see all these folks in this short little film, telling about the filming and why they chose our town for
the setting and how much fun they had making the movie.",1441411200,5,1064,4.086538461538462

This behind the scenes look at the making of the movie is a special treat, and the only problem that I had was that it was not longer!  Only some of the actors were available (none of the female leads were interviewed) but it was a tribute in many ways to the determination of filmmakers to overcome adversity and to make a vision come to life.  Short and sweet, and unofficial, but worth watching for all the goonies who still watch the film with no hesitation.",1440892800,,509,4.336842105263158

6658100,5,B00NJ1Z26O,"I like this movie, but hadn't seen it in several years, when I recently saw it on TV.  I love the fun and creative story line of this Spielberg adventure.  There are several good actors in it ( who are grown now) Sean Astin,  Josh Brolin, Martha Plimpton, and a very funny guy, Chunk, played by Jeff Cohen.  As this group of kids follow a map looking for pirate treasure, they run into bad guys, caves with traps, and  a ghost ship.  This is classic Spielberg, and a movie you will not grow tired of.  There is some language and innuendo that I think is inappropriate, so I would recommend it for kids 13 and up.",1436227200,,612,4.224137931034483

6658105,5,B00NJ1Z26O,"AWESOME WITH PRIME

This is awesome with Amazon Prime because it's free. It's not worth paying money for though. (Unless you're like a SUPER fan of the Goonies, which I would totally understand!)

It's just a collection of interviews shot randomly with the case and crew of the movie talking about experiences making the film. It's a really neat look into the movie and the movie making process.

You will learn things like how the Fratelli brothers (the actors) hated each other in real life. So their constant bickering in the movie was really just them bicking.

It's a great way to spent a half hour if you're a Goonies fan and you have Amazon Prime so you can watch it at no extra cost. It's probably not worth $3.",1433289600,,719,4.507692307692308

8678530,5,B00NJ1Z26O,I've been looking for this documentary a long time. Kind of way too short & not really a documentary. But a must watch for hardcore GOONIES! Someone really needs to make a legit DOCUMENTARY.  This is like a special feature on a 25h anniversary DVD.,1532908800,,248,4.511111111111111
8678531,3,B00NJ1Z26O,"I was excited when I saw this documentary, but when I saw the length of it I was disappointed before I even started it. It's simply much too short! Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching it and hearing the behind the scenes stories, but just as the story was starting to get interesting, they'd cut quickly to the next story. They hint at the octopus deleted scene, but then don't really talk much about it. There was potential for an amazing look behind the scenes, but the quick cutting just doesn't let the documentary reach the full potential. The lack of many cast members was also disappointing, but that's probably more about availability.",1506902400,,646,4.675438596491228

It seemed more like a college level film student's first attempt at a short film.  It did not explore locations in Astoria OR, in depth where the movie was filmed.  It focused on the interaction between film's stars.",1484870400,,349,4.766666666666667
