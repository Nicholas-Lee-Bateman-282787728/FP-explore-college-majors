6208105,4,B00HSVRUKC,"Just to give you a heads up, this movie is definitely more humorous than scary. All in all, I found it to be quite entertaining though. To give a brief synopsis: This group of bank robbers are on the run from the police and they end up getting all tangled up in this evil witch convention in the process. Yes, the plot is more than a little over the top, but I encourage you to stay open minded. There's plenty of blood, guts, wild action scenes and gross-out moments. The movie also gives a different take on that good old battle of the sexes theme. Both the special effects and the acting were surprisingly good. Thumbs up! This one is a gem!",1405728000,3,644,4.286885245901639

6208107,5,B00HSVRUKC,"Excellent little movie.  Witching and Bitching (somewhat of a nonsensical title, but the Spanish one wouldn't fly in the States - literally, 'The Witches of Zugarramurdi'), as others have said, is not to be taken as a horror film, but more of an absurd fantasy involving witches, which in most other contexts would be a recipe for scares.  Instead, it focuses on group of men who, in a bid to rid themselves of financial and female troubles, end up wandering into a rather bizarre little town with more than its fair share of the aforementioned witches.  If it reads like I'm being purposefully vague, it's for a reason: the movie works best if you don't have a play-by-play going in.

Otherwise, there are some notable Spanish actors (I only found this out afterwards), some excellent strong roles for the female cast members, and neat effects.  The humor is wonderfully crude, but subtle, as far as dialogue is concerned, which fits nicely with some of the craziness you see on screen.  The translation (subtitling) is pretty good, but there are a few scenes where the white lettering is washed out by what's going on in scene.

Not for the young ones, but anything above 14 or 15 should be OK; if they're going after foreign films with subtitles, they'll likely be fine.  If you like this, I'm told you'll also dig ""The Last Circus,"" also directed by Alex de la Iglesia.  I'll be checking that out shortly.",1405468800,5,1409,4.695121951219512

6208109,4,B00HSVRUKC,"If you know Spanish (Spain) humor, then you know what to expect. Its very irreverent. The story revolves around our unlikely protags, who are a group of men with resentments against the opposite sex, among other things, of course. They soon find themselves in the lair of a matriarchal (large) cult of witches  The production values are strong. I imagine this film had a strong budget to work with. The visuals are striking and rich, giving me the feeling of a graphic novel brought to life. Not that it is anime, just a feeling I had, from watching the colorful, attention grabbing, polished visuals, ranging from the various costumed people that appear at the very beginning to the CGI endowed climax.

The film explodes from the beginning, with a fast paced, action filled, armed robbery. There are no lulls, no gradual build ups, no slow pacing. Its a fast rollercoaster ride from beginning to end. There's a pre-pubertal kid in it, but the film is not PG13ified by his inclusion. The content is largely mature themed, mainly in terms of the dialogue.  The film is unrated but it could've been R, at least by my standards.

There's a not subtle social commentary running through it, which is definitely culturally relevant in Spain. I wouldn't be surprised if American men would be able to identify with the feelings our protags express. I don't want to spoil anything, as its best to let the film surprise you and it should. Its definitely not a typical film experience. Its larger than life, in more than one way. More spectacle than theater.

I do have to disagree with the other reviewer who compared it to classic Spanish horror. To me, it was as far removed from Amando de Ossorio's Blind Dead movies as you could get (and I love, love, love those). And Paul Naschy? He never crossed my mind when I was watching this. Its not in the style of Eurohorror. Its actually not what I consider horror to be at all. Lovers of any horror movie may not like this flick. Lovers of fantasy, with macabre/occult imagery and themes, as well as colorful, visually striking images (ala Pan's Labyrinth, but not as iconic, and definitely nowhere near as serious or dark), those who appreciate irreverent humor and who do not mind subtitles if they need them, may very well like this film. It was definitely a 4.5 experience, for me, of a 5 star production. I was very entertained by it but I'm not jumping up and down that it was made, and I am in no rush to watch it again, so that's why it doesn't get a 5 from me. 5s are the best I can give, so I reserve 5 stars for movies that compel me to give them.",1402876800,17,2598,4.519148936170213
6208110,5,B00HSVRUKC,"This is one of the best witch movies I've seen. In many ways the tone is not unlike Jim Henson's 'The Witches' with Angelica Huston, if that movie had gone more for the gore of horror. It is comedic/surreal/magickal/over-the-top. And this film is clearly a commentary on the battle of the sexes and men's fear of modern women. It flows with the pacing of early Peter Jackson or Sam Raimi, so if you loved 'Evil Dead', you will no doubt appreciate this one. It's a fun ride so hold on to your broomstick...",1402790400,3,505,4.440860215053763
6208111,4,B00HSVRUKC,"This film has been on my queue for at least two years and I am kicking myself for taking as long as I did to give it a watch.  From Spanish cult director Alex de la Iglesia (The Day of the Beast, The Last Circus), Witching & Bitching is just what I needed to compliment this Halloween season.  From start to finish it perfectly blends comedy and horror in what results in a 110-minute ride filled with outrageous antics that suck you in.  I couldn't believe some of the things I saw, and they came executed so well that I am currently bitching at myself for what Id been missing out on.

After fumbling a jewelry heist, Jose, Tony, and Joses young son Sergio are on the run from the authorities and especially from Joses ex-wife.  Their troubles are amplified when they are forced to take refuge for the night in the notorious village of Zugarramurdi, where a coven of witches kidnap them in preparation for a fertility sacrifice that is anything but pleasant.

Alex and his long-time co-writer Jorge Guerricaechevarria pen this piece, giving genre fans a taste of good horror blended with effective comedy.  The flick begins with the jewelry heist, where the thieves are dressed as street performers as part of their cover.  The hilarity is already kicking into gear thanks to them being in silly costumes, and things are kicked up a notch when they are forced to run from the police like this.  Because he needs to take advantage of visitation privileges with his son, Jose decides to bring the very young Sergio along for the ride.  He isn't just there for the ride though, as he too is pointing guns at people.  You can see why Jose is not on good terms with Sergios mother, a responsible nurse.  The three escape with the forced help of a taxi driver and his client, and they arrive in Zugarramurdi about 28 minutes in to the film.  This first act doesnt have too much to do with the horror.  Instead it sets up the characters, the dynamic between them, and their predicament.  Jose isn't just on the run from the authorities now.  His fuming ex wife is also on the lookout for him after involving her son in a stickup gone bad.  With so many forces at play the films 110 minutes don't feel like 110 minutes.  This story moves briskly without rushing and leaving too much dead air, which indicates good pacing by the writers.  It takes 53 minutes for the witching to finally begin, leaving roughly an hour of the goods to enjoy.  Thankfully, I was enjoying the film well before the horror kicked in thanks to hilarious antics and the looming anticipation of what would lie before them as night set in.

When the horror kicks in to gear it never relents.  The use of the witches is amazing, as they bounce off walls and bring with them classic lore of consuming frog/toad blood, making potions, and cooking their guests alive.  This is all boiling up to a sacrificial ceremony that will leave your eyes springing out of their sockets.  I won't ruin the final sequences for you, but lets just say you will probably laugh at the insanity going on before you.

Alex De La Iglesias direction of the film is fantastic, bringing every element to life and doing so as a veteran who has not lost a step.  He begins with the characters, who actors execute them to full potential.  The performances can be a little cheesy sometimes, but that is because of the comedic element.  This is especially be the case with the witches, namely the exotic Eva (portrayed by Alexs wife Carolina Bang), yet I found them fun and not detrimental to the film.  Yugo Silva is perfect as Jose, expertly blending numbskull attitude with redeeming qualities that make hard to dislike.  Just, don't marry Jose.  The real testament to Iglesias direction is the horror, which is some of the best that 2014 has to offer.  I loved how he executed the witches and the horror they delivered.  We are given classic witches living on the outskirts of a modern society, so they are not watered down in the least.  Iglesias high intensity action sequences deliver asses kicked as well as some decent gore at times.  The only negative would be that some gore scenes come with CGI blood, but thankfully I was having too much fun to care.

Overall, Witching & Bitching is a great Spanish horror film I recommend to all.  From start to finish its fun, unrelenting in comedy, and damn good with its horror.  This would be especially fun to watch during this Halloween season.",1475712000,,4433,4.571609632446134

6208119,4,B00HSVRUKC,"Is there a current misogynistic horror trend going around nowadays, or is it simply an ongoing thing that never goes away? Well, this one certainly qualifies even if, I suspect one is not to take it too seriously.
lex de la Iglesia takes the basic structure of From Dusk To Dawn, applies it to gold ring thieves and instead of vampires gives us a coven of Middle Ages' witches that has survived to modern day in an infamous, isolated town close the border of Spain (it certainly works better than an undiscovered town of vampires in the US/Mexico border.) There are no two movies joined together at the middle, as the two halves are tonally and thematically well integrated.

Lots of influences from Bava, Konstantin Ershov (The Vij), possibly The Old Dark House, The Addams Family (and others of that ilk,) Peter Jackson (Dead Alive, and amazingly The Lord of the Rings!)
Shares much in common with The Mother of Tears. Had Argento used this basic story for the last installment of his Mothers Trilogy it would have been more successful.

The movie is basically an allegory for the battle of the sexes, but how can there be a 'battle of the sexes' when each side fails to work together against the other and constantly spoil the efforts of others of the same sex? This movie comes off more as an utter inability of men to understand the emotional needs of women & their way of behaving & thinking than the patent misogyny of The Wicker Man (2006.)
It constantly undermines the horror & suspense with goofy humor, so it qualifies more as a comedy than anything else.

Fun, enjoyable, with mild adult themes, flashes of nudity and some cartoonish, if graphic violence.

6208132,4,B00HSVRUKC,"Cannibalistic witches, deadbeat dads, idiotic sidekicks, angry spouses, and incompetent cops collide in the Spanish flick entitled ""Witching and Bitching.""

All Jose wants is some quality time with his son. His ex-wife berates him, and he has no money. So he hatches a plan to steal some gold. And he includes his son in the plot. It's not a wise idea. But neither is his sidekick Tony, who realizes that involving your son in an armed robbery isn't good parenting, but that's where the extent of his insight ends.

As Jose and Tony try to escape town, they hijack and occupied taxi and find themselves in a town full of cannibalistic witches.

Loopy and campy and, at times, laugh-out-loud funny, ""Witching"" subscribes to the theory that women are far too hard and demanding on men, and that they (women) need to take their power back from the men who would attempt to subjugate them. It's an interesting message in a tale where the men are dumb and the women are evil. But message aside, for those who like camp, the movie is pretty damn funny.",1423094400,2,1046,4.643243243243243

6208137,3,B00HSVRUKC,"[WARNING: SPOILERS; CULTURAL-HISTORICAL BABBLING THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE WORTH READING.]
The idea of turning the Willendorf Venus into a thirty-foot tall troll, whose -- truly -- iconic beehive-basket head-covering hides a rotting face, is plenty disturbing, and pretty inspired. Her fat, sagging body is completely nude, and she has serious hygiene problems. She's also the perfect monster for this satirical horror-comedy, which explores the Spanish-Catholic fixation with witches and the fear of female sexuality that drives it. It's not subtle, but it is clever at times, and pretty funny.

Judging by 'Witching and Bitching', it seems like Spanish attitudes toward women are about three decades behind North America, but I doubt this movie could be construed as being representative of any segment of Spanish society. Witches were absolutely terrifying to all Christian cultures not so long ago, personifying the threat that patriarchal attitudes suspected women posed. At the height of anti-witch hysteria, any hint of critical thinking could get a girl killed. Puritan witch-trials and the Spanish Inquisition were responsible for torturing, burning and beheading countless innocent people, with methods of detection and ascertaining guilt that were notoriously lose/lose. Woodcuts and paintings from the Renaissance to Romanticism, particularly those by Durer, Mantegna, Rosa and Goya, depict Witches as something akin to demons, dancing with legions of animated skeletons and corpses, both human and animal, practicing satanic rituals that included bestiality, necrophilia, coprophagia, and cannibalism.

Today, witchcraft seems like an attractive religious alternative to a small percentage of the population, in both its Gnostic/Satanic and Wiccan/New Age variations. To most, however, it's a half-silly, half-tragic historical curiosity, or a haven for reality-dodging posers. But no one in North America finds witches scary like some Spaniards apparently do. Atheism and Feminism have stripped witches of their power; with the former, the reasons are obvious; with the latter, it was unintentional, accomplished mostly by confirming the darkest fears of the Conservative Christians and Muslims: that women sometimes enjoy sex (just not with them), and have their own preferences and opinions on the subject. Reality was far worse than the Puritans could have dreamt: the 'gentler sex' has a powerful allure, an ability to manipulate and inspire base lustful thoughts in men, and it has nothing to do with being possessed by demons or entering into a Satanic compact. Selling their souls is entirely unnecessary -- high heels, a short skirt, and a bit of makeup usually does the trick. What follows, of course, something 'enlightened' males take for granted, is that the seemingly absurd lengths some guys go to in hopes of impressing women can't be blamed on a spell, amulet, or other such aphrodisiac, and it can't be blamed on the devil. It CAN be blamed on the annoying evolutionary refinements that drive otherwise sane, intelligent people to write terrible f***ing songs. The fear of women is still alive and well in the Middle East, of course. Even the sight of a pretty face is too risky, hence the burka. And in parts of Africa, the 'cutting of the rose' is widely practiced; by removing the clitoris, 'female circumcision' is meant to deter adultery. I'm tolerant of other beliefs. I also try to keep an open mind and study the various faiths that have evolved and gone extinct around the world. So I'm comfortable passing judgement on any venomous, f***ed-up faith or philosophy that supports practices of that kind. Africa is such a rich, beautiful continent, but so much of it... Hell is other people, as they say.

I can see people really liking this film, it just wasn't my thing, for the most part. The first act is pretty strong, starting with an idiotic scheme to rob a street-level gold-exchange, posing as the regular costumed street performers who busk in the city square. So a Jesus covered in silver paint, with just a loin-cloth and a gun that was hidden in his cross, and a green-painted plastic soldier with a real weapon, barge into the exchange with the faintest of plans. Considering the fact that they just met one another, IN that very exchange, speaks to their intelligence. So does the ten-year-old boy they've brought along -- 'Jesus' Son', I suppose. When their partners are captured and their car is taken by the plastic soldier's girlfriend, they commandeer a cab. What follows is a long, comical discussion about women, and the easily swayed cabbie decides to join the carjackers. Eventually, they end up in Zigurramurdi, a town inhabited and controlled by witches.

Even as a fan of Goya's black paintings, the Inquisition-based imagery was fascinating, but not enough. Funny, interesting, original, but too over-the-top -- when hundreds of elaborately costumed extras break into a huge, choreographed musical number, I check out. It's like 'From Dusk Till Dawn' crossed with 'Pan's Labyrinth' and a lame 1980's comedy. I'm sure some consider that the scientific formula for the perfect movie-going experience, but for others, it's the Tenth Circle of Hell.
