8172245,3,B000MTOM80,"To start off again, this is not season three of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX. This is only the third volume of the first season. Both seasons one and two have been shown completely on Cartoon Network and they're currently showing season three episodes on Saturdays. Like I said before, each season of GX, as I like to call it, has 52 episodes. This volume doesn't even make the half-way mark for the season. Just wanted to clear that up for those who would like to buy this item.

By the way, Jaden is not dueling Joey. If that were the case, I would have given this DVD 5 stars instead. Joey was never a copycat duelist and he wouldn't steal Yugi's deck. After all, Yugi and Joey are best friends. In the ""The King of Copycats"" duel Jaden does duel someone with Yugi's deck, but he's really just a kid with a lot of self-idenity issues. Anyway, the episodes before the Copycat duel aren't that interesting to me. They have their moments, but the Copycat duel is worth watching mainly due to the images of Yugi and some other surprises to those who have seen the previous Yu-Gi-Oh! series. Unfortunately, there is still too much focus on Jaden and hardly anyone else duels for a large part of this season. Hopefully, 4Kids will release the volume with the start of the second arc in this season, which does have some more interesting moments in this season.

Overall, if you're a fan of GX, then this DVD is for you. The reason why I gave this volume a lower score than I did for volume two is because the episodes are less interesting to me and there is just too much focus on Jaden for my tastes. Anyway, its still okay, but I'm looking foreword to when the volumes have some episodes later on in the season.",1177977600,6,1694,4.39171974522293
