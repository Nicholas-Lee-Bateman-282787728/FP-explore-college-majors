8482098,4,B005OV1NM4,"I am really torn here. Do I review this as an opera or a parody? As an opera,the production is terrible. It is mercifully short with heavy cuts. Peterson's voice is outstanding, but that's it for singing. The set is abysmal and the orchestra merely adequate.
But as parody, it is mostly very funny. Let's go with that. Alfredo has become Jackie Gleason's ""Poor Soul"", a country bumpkin who holds books upside down, hides behind Violetta's back when being chased, and generally acting like a fool. Violetta falls or is pushed off a chair five or six times, moons her party guests who then fight over coats. In the second act, Germont brings along his 12 year old daughter (what, no girl scout cookies to sell?) and then slaps her around twice (although child abuse generally isn't funny) and wrestles with Violetta over a gun. The curtains (which is the only set besides a chair) become places to hide or get rolled up in.  The only disappointment is that Violetta's death isn't funny enough. True, Alfredo and Violetta do some strange movements with their arms but it's not clear what that means. Violetta just walks off stage leaving the rest of the principals standing in the aisle blocking some of the audience's view. That's not particularly funny. Perhaps the Three Stooges could come in, pick her up and dump her in a trash receptacle. That might get a final laugh.
So you have a choice. If you are looking for an authentic tragic opera, look elsewhere, but if you want some laughs, this is the one.  Next up : Tristan and Isolde Meet Abbot and Costello",1518652800,,1559,4.644927536231884
8482099,3,B005OV1NM4,"What I liked:
You won't find a more attractive pair of leading ladies (Marlis Petersen as Violetta and Kristina Fehrs as Flora) on any other DVD of this opera. Petersen gives us a fine performance both singing and acting. Giuseppe Varano sings well also. The orchestra is not a first tier ensemble but they execute very well in this performance. The conducting is inspired. I liked the introduction of Giorgio Germont's daughter. I liked it when Violetta threatened suicide with what appears to be a Walther PPK. One shot is fired in her struggle with Giorgio. Gunfire in opera is to me almost always a plus. I really like the end where Violetta slowly walked upstage and disappeared instead of the traditional onstage death we usually see.

What I am neutral about:
The staging is very minimalist. At one point in act one Alfredo appears in the audience and sings. Fortunately his voice is picked up loud and clear. In act three there is a point where the doctor, Annina, Alfredo and Giorgio are all in the audience.

What I didn't like:
The cuts are inexcusable. The gypsy and matador dance sequence is entirely cut.
This is one of the highlights of Flora's party. Why deprive us of the catchy tunes
Verdi wrote. This is also an opportunity to display some unique choreography. The
director either doesn't appreciate dance or maybe they didn't have the budget for
it. The other vocal cuts are annoying but tolerable.
I can't understand making Alfredo such a nerdy, bookworm. In act one he flounders at the party like a fish out of water. He is also the worst dressed guy at BOTH parties. I really hoped Violetta would hook up with the baron instead of Alfredo. The baron was much more virile.

I really enjoyed Petersen's performance as Violetta but as another reviewer said
this performance may be best appreciated as an audio CD.",1352073600,2,1833,4.721875
8482100,3,B005OV1NM4,"This production of ""La Traviata"" leaves me shivering - shivering at the resultant tampering of Verdi's musical and dramatic masterpiece.
I fully agree with one reviewer that this 'alternative' approach to the work marred the musical set up, not just the dramatic set up. So I am not sure if you just play it for sound without watching would ultimately 'save' this production, though it must be better than seeing it.
Soprano Marlis Petersen definitely deserves a much better production - despite not having that 'extra' E flat at the end of 'Sempre Libera', her Violetta here is a dashing performance. If the producer but would adorn her in better garbs, one that would top Anna Netrebko's.
Or probably even Angela Gheorghiu's.
Petersen is a very handsome young soprano: tall, slender, vulnerable looking, and what's most important, can truly sing.
'Listening' to her violetta is nothing but sheer pleasure - she maneouvres her way through the various Acts with real aplomb, and sings with refreshing timbre and devotedness throughout. In terms of singing, she is probably on par with Anja Hateros in this same role.
Varano's Alfredo is difficult to endear visually. This certainly is the fault of the director/producer. He does muster more vocal goods than Rolando Villazon as Alfredo.
The other main protagonist Pere Germont is even more abominable in this production, so much so that the baritone portraying this character faced a really hard time. He sings adequately, but with such a characterisation, the audience would hope for nothing but wishes he be gone with that little girl of his forthwith and leave Violetta alone!
In short, it is very difficult to be appreciative of this much-tampered version of La Traviata, despite outstanding vocal portrayal by Marlis Petersen in the title role.
Let's hope she'd soon have ANOTHER chance.",1330214400,3,1842,5.102649006622516
8482101,2,B005OV1NM4,"This performance of La Traviata is one of the best sung and acted (within the confines of the HORRIFIC production/direction, but more on that in a moment).  Marlis Petersen sings beautifully and can handle all of the different types of singing required throughout the three acts, and she sings with intelligence and the soul of Violetta.  Giuseppe Varano was new to me before watching this video, but he gives one of the best-sung performances of Alfredo.  James Rutherford is also quite good, but lacks some of the gravitas of the best Germonts.

All of that greatness, however, is just about wasted on the most wretched and misguided production I have ever seen.  I don't mind minimalism, but this staging was ridiculous.  The only furniture was a single chair, and there are layers of curtains that the characters spend much time inexplicably moving back and forth.  Worse yet is that, against this backdrop (for what little it is), the principals are made to act almost as if they are in an insane asylum.  In the extended scene between Violetta and Germont pere in Act II, which I think is generally one of the greatest and most moving scenes in all of opera, when Violetta sings of the sacrifice she will make, the director has her pull a gun out to her purse and intimate that she will kill herself (rather than leaving Alfredo for the Baron) and sing the scene as if it were a bel canto mad scene.  Similarly, during her big aria at the end of Act I, the director has Violetta singing part of it while standing on the chair and at one point either falling or throwing herself off of it -- pointlessly.  There are similar moment of lunacy on the parts of the Germonts - the most offensive of which is when Alfredo appears to be raping Violetta at Flora's party, rather than merely throwing money at her.

Other directorial decisions are just stupid -- as if the director never read the libretto.  At Flora's party, at no point before Violetta sings ""Invitato a qui seguirmi"" do you see her ask Alfredo to come meet her.  Similarly, earlier in the party seen, Flora sings to Violetta ""Alfredo's here.  Do you see him?"" when he is standing inches in front of her.  After Alfredo offends Violetta, all of the singers are lying on the floor asa if dead.  Germont pere comes in stepping all over the bodies until he can find Alfredo, who is singing throughout.  And there's more -- sheer craziness.

Finally, the final scene is directed in such a silly way as to distract the viewer from what's going on.  After all I've written, the most damning thing I can say about this production of La Traviata is that I did not cry at the end.  As much as I was moved by many aspects of Marlis Petersen's and Giuseppe Varano's performances, I just wanted the insanity to end.  I think it's a good thing that the director was not given a curtain call.  I'm certain he would have been booed off the stage.",1321747200,16,2895,4.53757225433526
