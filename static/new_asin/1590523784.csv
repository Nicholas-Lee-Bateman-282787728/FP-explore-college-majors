7799580,5,1590523784,The lessons on this DVD series will last through your years of parenting. It's great! I watched this 6 plus years ago and remembered so much of what was said because it was relevant and applicable. We picked it up to use as a teaching tool with other parents and rewatched it. It's still relevant today.,1299110400,2,303,4.428571428571429
7799581,5,1590523784,"This DVD is great for a small group or parenting class.  I have also used segments in working with parents through special classes geared toward baptism and other milestone moments.  Reggie and Andy are both entertaining, informative, and heartfelt with practical wisdom and memorable concepts.",1282521600,2,294,5.511111111111111
