7673548,4,B01CDT63YM,"Even though the movie strays far and wide from the book, the 1948 movie version of ""The Woman in White"" is one of the many enjoyably atmospheric black-and-white mystery/thrillers, filled with lots of psychological terror, that came out in the mid to late forties,  similar to ""The Spiral Staircase,"" ""Green For Danger,"" ""The Paradine Case,"" ""Spellbound,"" among others. The undisputed highlight of ""The Woman in White"" is Sydney Greenstreet as the sinister and menacing ""Count Fosco"" who looms large throughout the film, both literally and figuratively. Agnes Morehead plays the pitiable and somnambulistic wife of ""Count Fosco,"" while Alexis Smith is superb as the assertive ""Mariam Holcombe,"" who goes toe-to-toe with ""Count Fosco."" Gig Young in an early role is the typical ""good guy to the rescue,"" and Eleanor Parker is excellent as the helpless female ""pawn"" whose mind and soul are up-for-grabs between Gig Young, Alexis Smith, and Sydney Greenstreet.

Admittedly, the film is not great but it is enjoyable and fun. Not one of those films to be dissected because of its lack of subtext, sterling dialogue, and compelling storyline. The movie is worth a watch simply because of the ensemble cast, especially Sydney Greenstreet.",1457136000,28,1232,5.248730964467005
7673559,5,B01CDT63YM,"Excellent movie which unfortunately has never gotten the publicity it deserves.  Takes place during the Victorian age, so costumes, set decorations are all of that era.  But the acting was very good and the plot an enticing mystery.  I highly recommend it to movie lovers of that certain genre.",1498003200,2,294,4.959183673469388
7673560,5,B01CDT63YM,"This is a superb film based on the classic by Wilkie Collins with the same name. The book was so good, that it prompted me to read many other Wilkie Collins' books. Sydney Greenstreet is superb as the villain in this tale, Count Fasco. It is a much overlooked film, only 19 reviews are posted as I write this review. It is worthwhile viewing even though it is a 1948 film, some 70 years old. There are three versions of Collins The Woman in White. One in 1916, this one, and the latest in 1998.
Wilkie Collins (1824-1889), a friend and sometime co-author of Charles Dickens, wrote enjoyable books, novels, plays, and short stories. He is best known for his books The Woman in White and Moonstone. His plots are unusual and suspenseful. He has a keen understanding of psychology, which is reflected in his tales. Many fiction lovers consider Moonstone the first detective novel in the English language and reject the idea that Edgar A. Poe wrote in the genre before him. Experts call Collins works sensation novels.
The novel The Woman in White was Collins first published novel, in 1859. It is about a woman who is dressed entirely in white who was incarcerated in an insane asylum, who escaped, and came to the home of a rich heiress who looked almost exactly like her. She said she came to warn the heiress about a plot against her by Count Fasco and Sir Percival to get her to marry Sir Percival so that he could gain control over her vast riches. Although currently insane, she is telling the truth. Sir Percival wants to have the insane woman killed, and later even the heiress, but Count Fasco is against murder.
Why the insane woman is dressed in white, how she knows about the plot against the heiress, and why she and the heiress look remarkably alike are disclosed as the story advances.",1497312000,,1797,4.56656346749226

7673563,4,B01CDT63YM,"I have two versions of this classic novel on film.  Each deviates from the Collins' novel in the appearance of a major character.  In this 1948 movie, the plain sister is as pretty as the pretty one and in the 2005 movie Count Fosco is thin instead of fat (a la Sidney Greenstreet.)  But both versions are enjoyable. In many ways I prefer this one.  Either way, I suggest reading the novel.  In this era of short attention spans a solid, lengthy book is what the ""doctor"" ordered.  Remember, Collins was a friend of Charles Dickens and each influenced the other.  Dickens' last (unfinished) novel was a mystery story -- much more so that he didn't complete it and the solution remains a mystery.",1486339200,2,695,4.556451612903226
7673564,4,B01CDT63YM,"Collins is a great mystery writer and much more.  This film fascinates with its ways of domesticating his WOMAN IN WHITE.  Example:  Marian Halcombe in the novel is anything but pretty--""The woman was ugly"" is the last line of one of the best introductions of a character in a 19th Century novel.  Alexis Smith is beautiful, and a good actress, but not Collins' Marian.  The ending is very changed.  The real Collins flavor comes in the performances of Sidney Greenstrert and Agnes Morehead.  They make the whole sorthwhile.",1480636800,2,524,4.886363636363637

7673567,4,B01CDT63YM,"This is a good, but dated, movie.  If a modern viewer is simply looking for modern, popular entertainment, this movie may not be what one has in mind.  The movie is from the 1940s and is an attempt to recreate a Victorian Novel composed by Wilkie Collins.

Wilkie Collins is a contemporary and friend of Charles Dickens.  If one enjoys Victorian Novels in general and Charles Dickens in particular this novel is a really interesting study.  It is one of the first ""modern"" mystery novels.  There is an arch villain, Count Fosco.  Being a fan of both Victorian Novels and movies from the 1930s, 1940's, and 1950's, upon reading the novel, I literally pictured Syndney Greenstreet as the perfect person for the role of Count Fosco.

Now I have seen the movie.  Count Fosco is played by Sydney Greenstreet.  The beautiful Eleanor Parker and very young Gig Young also star.  If one is a fan of Hollywood History, one may enjoy this movie from the standpoint of watching these fine stars.

In summary, I enjoyed this movie from the standpoint of comparing and contrasting this movie to the novel and from the standpoint of watching here fine stars perform.  However, the movie is stylistically dated and, viewed in a vacuum, may not fit the tastes of some modern viewers.  Thank You...",1477785600,,1280,4.733031674208145

7673571,2,B01CDT63YM,"If you read the book, this movie will be very disappointing, and may be even if you didn't, but you won't know that the story was changed drastically to create caricatures of the characters. They lost all their depth and complexity. And there was never any love interest between Marian and Walter. It was Marian who got sick, not Laura and the ending is a complete fantasy. Every now and then I heard characters speak actual lines from the book, but overall, it was a complete rewrite of the story. And Fosco???? Yikes, he is so transparent in this movie, nothing like the book (even though he is devious, it's much more polished) and in the book we don't see him until after Laura and Percival come back from their 6 months on the continent. And Percival is so drab in the movie, he bears no resemblance to the abusive and angry man in the book.",1469664000,2,846,4.42948717948718
7673572,4,B01CDT63YM,"It's way different from the book but so was the Masterpiece Theater 2 hour film, which missed the climax with Fosco. Who cares. The book was great and very complex, told in a brilliant fashion. But this cast is superb and the whole film is to showcase a sinister Count Fosco. Marian (Alexis Smith) is strong, Eleanor Parker a fabulous pretty but weak woman in white in 2 roles, Gig Young as a capable hero, the hypochondriac uncle Mr. Farley is a hoot, Agnes Moorehead as Fosco's wife....totally different as if she were a new character and the ending so different you will not see any resemblance to the book. Don't worry. Great flick reminding me of a Hitchcock film. I see the 6 hour BBC version is available on YouTube, so perhaps that will be more faithful to the book. So far neither this or masterpiece theater is even close to the book. If you are not a purist you will find both versions worth watching.",1466380800,2,912,4.467065868263473
7673573,5,B01CDT63YM,"I'll start off by saying that if there was ever an unsung gem in the classical sense of films, then this is it. An awesome first-class cast, before they were even considered top-tier, and an impressive overall production, makes this one of this writer's favorite films. It's no secret to anyone that knows me that I thoroughly enjoy Victorian eclectic films that border on Gothic such as ""Great Expectations"" and ""Blanche Fury"".

When I first heard a sampling of Max Steiner's rousing score at the TCM site, I was hooked: I just knew I had to order this DVD mini-masterpiece. Hollywood icon, Bette Davis said that Max Steiner knew drama better than anyone at Warner Brothers.

Almost brilliant in direction, Peter Godfrey of ""A Christmas In Connecticut"" fame, masterfully plays his main players as pieces on a chess board. Move this one here and move that one there. Leading the cast is a capable but not too impressive Alexis Smith, a tepid, but nevertheless heroric Gig Young, gloriously fiendish Sydney Greenstreet and sneaky, despicable John Emery, Greenstreet's partner in crime.

John Abbott, I believe, took the proverbial cake and cherry on top with it and should have gotten the Oscar-nod as a supporting actor at least. And what a performance he gave as the hyper-hypochondriac, Uncle Frederick. With Agnes Moorehead giving an exceptional performance as well, it couldn't get any better. Well, not quite.

A young, beautiful, Warner Brothers starlet that still had not reached major stardom in Hollywood virtually commanded attention throughout the film. I speak of the ravishing beautiful, extraordinarily gifted actress, Eleanor Parker. I consider her acting prowness to be so of the first order, that I even uploaded a new website dedicated to her work in filmdom. It's at Eleanorforever.com

Playing a dual role as both the ethereal, slightly demented, spooky Anne Catherick, and her magnificently gorgeous look-alike rich cousin, Laura Fairlie, we have one of the first cases of identity theft in a film. As Anne, she glides and prances through the moonlit night as if on a mystified cloud. Although she's ""out of it"" to some extent, she has not totally lost her sanity and is privy to a horrible secret.

As Laura, well, she's just plain svelt and aristocratic in bearing. Her sheltered life has made her a little naive, shall we say? What a combo in a most challenging role. Eloquent, well-paced and with typical black and white sets giving it a slight noir look, I had to watch it over again, several times, just to understand the intricacies of the balletic plot and subplots. Beware though. It is well worth the time spent in discovering this Victorian classic--ala Hollywood 1948.

A Slight Digression:

Although the film takes place in Victorian England, few of the actors speak with even a remote English accent with the possible exception of natural Brits Greenstreet and John Abbot. Gig Young doesn't even attempt to sound anything but Yank, Smith is sweetly American-sounding although she was Canadian by birth and Moorehead had few lines during the film.

However, with Eleanor Parker's incomparable flair for period drama, her unblemished beauty, dulcet voice, impeccable diction, this time with a very slight English accent, ""The Woman In White"" will hold you and mesmerize you with its impressive cast in an almost perfect movie.

Another case in point: I don't know why in this striking film adaptation, the writer, Stephen Moorehouse Avery and Director Peter Godfrey didn't leave the original Wilkie Collins scenario of Marian (Alexis Smith), Anne Chatherick (Eleanor Parker 1) and Laura Fairlie, Eleanor Parker 2) being half sisters. Now, for whatever reasons, there are converted to being cousins. With its haunting, robost score and eerie backdrop, it's simply a wonderful way to see a exceptionally well produced motion picture...with few, erratic Hollywood inconsistencies ....",1465776000,12,3914,5.139937106918239
7673574,5,B01CDT63YM,"I remember this film when I was very young; about 10.  Eleanor Parker is one of my favorite stars...the Times obit writer had the nerve to say she really wasn't a star.  Besides being beautiful with a unique profile she had a very recognizable voice. just as Ida Lupino had.  ""Interrupted Melody"" was another winner of hers.  In this film Sidney Greenstreet almost steals the show.  I like the way it's his wife Agnes Moorehead who kills him, totally unlike the book where he's done away with by a secret organizition.  For once Hollywood had a better take on it.  The BBC longer version is also excellent and very convincing.",1465516800,6,626,4.636363636363637

I can't do that...because they were both done very well...what I will say though is that I do noticed that back in the 1940's is when they came out with a lot of the film noir movies and your femme fatales..this is just of the same sort with your femme fatales but in a period film...another movie though that I liked from the 1940's is a movie (that I don't know if you can classify it as film noir but where you have your femme fatale and that is Leave Her To Heaven with Gene Tierney and one the best color film's of the 1940's)..and while we do have some good examples of mystery movies in the 1950's not as well as they could do them in the 1940's...just look at today a lot of movies Marvels Captain America or Marvels Agent Carter or all of the Foyles War movie's...I'm really glad that they decided to put this out onto dvd I recorded it off the tv when it came onto TCM..but was just wondering when it would come out onto dvd I'm very pleased that decided to do it now",1462665600,7,1233,4.1203319502074685

8752715,3,B01CDT63YM,"One of the big positives of Forties American movies was the Film Noir, shadowy thrillers heavily dosed with fatalism, and it's no surprise that Wilkie Collins' groundbreaking 19th century sensational mystery thriller The Woman in White was made into a film during the hey day of Film Noir. A superb groundbreaking novel sustaining narrative suspense throughout its complicated and lengthy story, it predated the first detective novel, Collins' The Moonstone, by a decade. Collins thought so highly of his creation that he marked his gravestone with the epitaph: ""Author of The Woman in White and other works of fiction"". Two protagonists shape the narrative - Marian Halcombe, the elder half-sister and companion to a nave heiress, and one of the great villains of Victorian fiction, Count Fosco, full name Isidor Ottavio Baldassare Fosco, a grossly obese Italian with a mysterious past: eccentric, bombastic, urbane but intelligent and menacing.

If after reading that description of the heavy your mind immediately calls up Sydney Greenstreet you are at one with the casting chief of the 1948 film. For the words could have been an almost perfect description of an earlier movie villain, one that appears at the very beginning of the genre, playing a central role in the legendary 1940 The Maltese Falcon, British actor Sydney Greenstreet as the 'Fat Man'. It marked Greenstreet's film debut, and it made him a legend. Prior to this he had acted for four decades on the British and American stages, triumphing during the Thirties with the most famous couple on Broadway, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. Widely respected, near the end of his career Tennessee Williams dedicated a one act play to him. Greenstreet played the bulbous Nero Wolfe on the radio at the start of the Fifties. Struggling for years with diabetes and Bright's Disease, Greenstreet died in 1954.

 So with a perfect bad guy for a great role -- what went wrong? Because this movie only just is salvaged by the actors, who make the best of the producers' brutal reduction and distortion of the original novel. Admitting the screenwriters faced a tremendous challenge, compressing such a expansive storyline into such an abbreviated version gutted much of its power and mystery. And rewriting many plot points only further weakened the result.

There are some compensations: Eleanor Parker portrays two roles, the mysterious title character and the self-effacing heiress. Parker never gave a bad performance, and her ethereal beauty perfectly fits the apparition-like nature of the Woman in White. Yet she never steals the film as Meryl Streep does in her very like (and in some ways derivative) role as the mysterious French Lieutenant's Woman.
Perhaps the biggest surprise among the cast is Alexis Smith. At this point in her career Smith was often cast as an icy beauty, haughty and reserved, but here in the critical role of the plucky and determined Marianne she's open, kindly, and extremely sympathetic. Sadly, Smith never receives the sort of buildup in the script so courageous a heroine deserves. Among the other actors, Agnes Moorhead in a small role plays Count Fosco's abused Italian wife to a fare-the-well, her face a silent mask of hate worthy of Medusa. Character actor John Abbott abuses his role as hypochondriac, though some may find it amusing, while a young Gig Young as the wan male love interest looks quite ridiculous in a thin moustache.
In sum, take the good parts, which very much fall to the actors and not the writers and direction, and enjoy. A  much later go at the story by British television is far worse - a truly fulfilling adaptation for film of this great novel has yet to be made.",1506470400,,3688,5.0
8752716,1,B01CDT63YM,"Let me begin by saying that I had high expectations for this film. In my experience, movies from the golden age of Hollywood (pre-1970) tended to have higher production values, stronger performances, and a better emphasis on story than the majority of those produced today. Wilkie Collins' ""The Woman in White"" is also one of my all-time favorite novels, and after being disappointed by the more modern television adaptations available I was eager to see the story brought to life by the likes of Eleanor Parker, Agnes Moorehead, Sidney Greenstreet, and Alexis Smith. Unfortunately, I found it just as disappointing, and am honestly amazed how anyone who has read the original book can give it such a high rating.

With a runtime of only 110 minutes, I wasn't expecting Masterpiece Theatre-level fidelity to every aspect of Collins' intricately-woven plot, but this film squanders the little time it has, replacing vital scenes with invented ones that add nothing to the plot or character development but a soap-opera veneer, and serve only to change and complicate the story unnecessarily until it is reduced to utter nonsense. And with the exception of Mr. Fairlie's scenes, Collins' vivid dialogue is all but obliterated, so the whole experience feels more like 1940's England than 1850's.

While the basic concept of Collins' story remains the same, this film deviates so far as to be almost unrecognizable, and loses any excitement or mystery that might be left in it. Rather than sprinkle little clues along the way as would befit a proper mystery or suspense story, which ""The Woman in White"" as a novel unquestionably is, this film has absolutely no subtlety or surprise: Antagonists telegraph what they're going to do beforehand, sometimes even directly to the protagonists themselves, so that the audience knows exactly what is going on at every moment. This makes the film seem much longer than it is, and leads to a very boring and uninvolving experience for the viewer.

And while the characters for the most part remain true to Collin's vision, I found certain changes particularly galling, such as changing Anne's parentage, making Laura and Marian cousins rather than half-sisters, excising Sir Percival Glyde's 'Secret' and relegating him to a much minor role, or having Walter make a major sea-change and transfer his affections from Laura to Marian on the drop of a hat.

As to the more technical aspects, the film at least tries to look period-appropriate, though the women's hairstyles are a strange hybrid between 1940's victory rolls and Gibson-girl updos. While the cast is good overall, with Eleanor Parker as beautiful as always in the dual roles of Laura Fairlie and Anne Catherick, Sydney Greenstreet well-cast as the villainous Count Fosco, and Agnes Moorehead as the ideal Madame Fosco, it is easy to tell they are hampered by a ridiculous script, and as a result all verge into melodrama more often than not. I also found the overbearing and frankly too-sprightly score to be distracting and a major hindrance to the already very shaky Gothic atmosphere.

To conclude, knowing ""The Woman in White"" as well as I do, I found this film an extremely wasted opportunity, as a story this suspenseful is actually more effective as a feature-length film than a miniseries, as there is less time to bog down in extraneous details. This film, while bearing almost no resemblance to Collins' novel, fails as a straightforward mystery as well. It might be watchable to those who have never read the book, but for those who have, don't waste your time.",1502236800,3,3570,5.013490725126475
