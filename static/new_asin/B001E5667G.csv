There was just a bit of background noise at the beginning, but not all that audible.  I was hoping to use it to relax at work, but I can't sleep on the job!",1278028800,,311,4.327586206896552
8296478,5,B001E5667G,"Seascapes is an excellent video to have around the house.  We use it when we have parties and you want to add to the atmosphere without the TV being the center of attention.

The footage is excellent quality and looks great on the new high def TV.  The kids really love the underwater footage and makes us all want to go back to Hawaii every time we see it.",1219881600,,357,4.144927536231884
