4834104,5,B005M4KZKO,"Take it from someone who's been there....this blu-ray is fantastic.  It's a perfect reminder of the places I visited, and a great inspiration to go see the places I didn't recognize.  The detail on the recordings is crisp, and the images are all taken from stationary vantage points.  Each new scene makes you feel like you're just sitting down in a lounge chair, taking in the view.  Each location is given 2 to 5 minutes of viewing time before you're taken to the next spot.  The disc gives you the option of playing just the ambient audio or adding a relaxing new-age soundtrack to the background.  Both options have their moments, but I prefer the ambient noise of the waves or the waterfalls more.  The Soundtrack option tends to drown out the natural background sound.  For instance, there is a scene called Lotus Flower Pond in Maui.  I first listened to it with the soundtrack on, but when I turned it off, I realized that there was a beautiful wind chime ringing quietly in the background.  You couldn't hear it at all with the music track.
I'll be honest -- this Blu-ray IS NOT for the person looking to have someone narrate a little journey for them.  The camera doesn't move, and nobody is telling you little factoids about each filming location.  All you get is a short bit of descriptive text at the beginning and end of each scene telling you the location and island, and that's it.  But for my tastes, this minimalist approach was absolutely brilliant.
Now for the bad news.  Unfortunately some of the places don't get nearly as much camera love as they should.  Iao Valley (one of the many beautiful patches of inland Maui) got maybe 2 minutes of camera time.  And the last scene of the Telescope observatory on the big island probably got a minute.  You might think the observatory is a strange place to film, but the desolation and isolation of the area is striking.  Finally, even though there is an option to loop the entire movie, they don't offer options to loop individual scenes.  That's a shame, because it is an easy feature to add, and it would have been great for some of those shorter scenes I mentioned.
Despite those little nitpicks, I'm still giving this a 5 star review. I expect this disc is going to be my go-to background video for quite some time....and naturally it's going to make me drop everything and go back to Hawaii again very soon.",1388361600,4,2378,4.57919621749409
4834105,4,B005M4KZKO,I love the places that were selected for this Blu-ray. The scenes are very relaxing. I like that I can select between the natural sounds and the natural sounds augmented by soothing music. The only drawback is the sound is not recorded in digital surround. It loses one star because of that.,1363910400,4,291,4.615384615384615
4834106,4,B005M4KZKO,"the disc QUALITY had a great look to it in HD the disappointing thing i found was the lack of a narrative
you were just watching the waves rolling onto the beaches IT needed a narrative track telling you about
where you were,what was special about the area (where was jack lord?)
AS a relaxing track to just sit and enjoy this was good.i just feel a alternate narrative track would of finished
the disc off the cuz",1363392000,3,414,4.32051282051282
4834107,5,B005M4KZKO,What you can see in this video are things you won't be able to see if you travel to the islands unless you go on a helicopter ride. The view and the beauty of these wonderful islands can be seen here and you will watch this over and over again.,1351814400,5,244,3.9

8479110,1,B005M4KZKO,"Every time a Blu Ray comes out on Hawaii I purchase it because I am totally consumed with Hawaii.  I travel there quite often and am very familiar with the sites to see, which are breathtaking to say the least.  However, this video captures virtually none of Hawaii's natural beauty other than a few scenes.  They did not even do enough research to find the correct names for a few spots.  As an example they just called the waterfall pictured a ""tropical waterfall"", instead of it's name, which is Wailua Falls.  Anyone familiar with ""The Road to Hana"" is familiar with his beautiful waterfall.
This dvd fails miserably in capturing Hawaii's beauty.  There are many very good ones to choose from that are far, far better than this.  If I had to give it a letter grade it would be an ""F""
Try ""Hawaii, ""An Island Symphony or HD Moods Hawaii if you want to see some beautiful sites of these incredible islands.
This is my very first negative review of anything on Amazon but this one is so bad I could not hold back!!!",1403308800,2,1016,4.45945945945946
8479111,4,B005M4KZKO,I put this on the TV when I want a calm background...it helps me relax.  The beautiful scenery is wonderful.,1393459200,,108,4.4
8479112,2,B005M4KZKO,"I ordered this DVD because of the positive reviews. The Blue Ray Disc is defective and will not play at all. I double checked my blue ray player and it works fine with multiple other blue rays I own.
I am not replacing this disc because the scenes are very long and boring (I played the regular DVD disc which was included). It appears that the videographer just put the camera on a tripod and left it for several minutes. How long can you look at a lotus flower? Not much better than stills.",1392681600,,492,4.24468085106383

8479114,5,B005M4KZKO,Very soothing and scenic. We watched it with the natural sounds and found it captivating. I'll be going there for the first time in about 4 months and hope I find some quiet scenes like ones shown.,1390780800,,197,4.351351351351352
