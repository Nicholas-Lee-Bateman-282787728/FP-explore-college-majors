8194826,5,B000Q73FGS,"For the longest time, Rumiko Takahashi's masterpiece that graced Japanese TV some 30 years ago, has been long since out of print. The first 4 or so volumes sold well enough to warrant their sequential releases, but snowballed rather steeply after Viz messed up the localization of this series for the second time; miscasting, failure to finish their original VHS sets, recasting, failure to sell the final two volumes on a known website.

The lack of care to this series is probably it's downfall, and will probably never see another release come state-side again, Volume 8 alone was limited to as few as 1,000 or so copies and is damn near impossible to find in any condition, never mind brand new. It is for this reason many consider this wonderful show to be the 'Holy Grail' of anime sets; many sets may say 'collector's edition' but none mean it as much as this right here.
As much as I love the show, I simply cannot recommend people dish out $2,000+ on it, it is a set left to only the animephiles and rich folk, and for that, it's best that this series dies alongside its ludicrous prices. Considering there is nowhere to legally stream this show, either, I simply recommend you watch it in any way possible. I'm so lucky to have kept up with this series as it was being released.",1423526400,,1288,4.551724137931035
8194827,1,B000Q73FGS,"Excuse me! one millon bucks for just a brand new set of the entire Maison Ikkoku series?! This is ridiculous. Why can't it just be 20 bucks for a brand new set? Come on people, what are you thinking? If you really think that some one is going to pay one million for this, that's not going to happen because if people want to make millions of dollars they would have to spend it on a new house, or a tv set, or even a car. But one million bucks on all eight box set's of Maison Ikkoku?! I don't think so. I'll tell you what, if you lower the price to $20, I'll buy it. But i'm not going to put myself through a lot just to buy this for one million. That's not going to happen.",1417046400,3,675,3.898550724637681

8194829,5,B000Q73FGS,"Maison Ikkoku is a brilliant manga (graphic novel) and very good anime.  But this boxed set I'm commenting on, if it's all-region as it says - is a bootleg.  The licensed copies (in US by Viz) are region 1 only.",1216512000,8,211,4.25
8194830,5,B000Q73FGS,"Actually ""maison ikkoku"" was one of the first animes that I became familiar with.  The story sometimes seems to be stalling a bit (since it is a 96 episode series), but the end compensates you for all the waiting...There are many episodes that make you think about the meaning of true love and really touch your heart!  A worth watching series, you won't regret it despite its (perhaps too much) length.",1204934400,5,403,4.661971830985915
