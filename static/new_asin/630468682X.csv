911757,5,630468682X,"A few people who have seen this movie will argue that it has no story, is too long, and drags violence on and on and on.  This movie does have a plot, and a very good one at that.  A branch of police called the special  security force deals with terrorism in Tokyo.  They stop the terrorists,  but then find out that they are just a cover-up for a branch of government  accepting money from an American company to dump waste in the rural regions  of Japan.  That is the background of the story.  When watching this movie,  be sure to pay attention.  As for all of the violence that drags on and on,  a lot of it can be best summarized with one word; disturbing.  This movie  can bring about a lot of disturbing moments, but you won't be able to stop  watching.  As for length, it is good to see some anime longer than 40  minutes.  All in all, after seeing this tape you most likely will not be  able to stop thinking about it.  The outcome is rather exciting.  There  will be moments where you will enjoy certain explosions, and others where  you will say, ""Why did that have to happen?""",947980800,8,1088,4.2254901960784315
911758,2,630468682X,"Angel Cop is a typical action flick. Lots of violence and just enough plot to justify all the blood and gore. That can be interesting if done right, which is not the case here. Everything is just repetitive, to the point that mindless violence does indeed become mindless violence. Take the final fight sequence for example. It takes nearly 2 episodes out of total 6 to kill the final boss. During which, the boss comes back from the dead number of times only to delay what is inevitably a predictable ending.",947721600,,509,4.604395604395604
911759,2,630468682X,"I ordered this tape to test a theory... that I like my anime fairly light and humourous. I'm not sure if this was the right one to test that theory with, as ""Angel Cop,"" while dark, gritty and bloody, is also a  pretty standard tale from the cyberpunk genre. (The characters are morally  questionable, they are working for bosses who are corrupt and getting ready  to screw everyone, and in the end, pretty much everyone dies.)
I do like  the fact that this single tape contains a complete story, but I was still  left feeling as though I wanted something a bit more original. Maybe  ""Angel Cop"" just isn't a tale that holds up well because of the  passage of time?",945648000,3,665,4.446280991735537
911943,5,630468682X,"I remember watching this short anime series of 6 episodes when I was back in High School. Or maybe it was even middle school. Either way, I was very impressed when I saw this about 8 or 9 years ago. But I had already seen some of the greats as far as Anime goes. Street Fighter 2: The Animated Movie, Ninja Scroll, Ghost in the Shell, Devil Man, Evangelion. This was a great addition to those.

One thing I really love about ANGEL COP was the realism of it all. It's animated, yet, there's no over exageration with comedy like huge sweat dripping down a characters forhead. No ones face suddenly goes blank or changes. It's done in a realistic way along the lines of Crying Freeman, Street Fighter, Ghost in the Shell etc.

This is must have for any fan of SERIOUS animation. Meaning that it's adult and mature, but not at all pornographic. Just a good movie with action for ""guys who like movies"" as TNT would say.

The reason I gave this 4 stars rather than 5 is because there were some parts that the animation was really well done and others where the animation was not as well as it could have been.

Overall, great flick!!",1174694400,3,1128,4.357142857142857
911944,5,630468682X,"OK, this isn't exactly the thinking man's Manga, but a kickass, nonstop action romp nonethless. A lot of American people will criticise this movie for disturbing images but in Japan they can take it. I'm talking about hardcore VIOLENCE MAN! Head popping, limb wrenching, flesh burning violent action in all of it's glory! And isn't that the main reason why people watch Manga films. This flick has it all - violence ""cops on the edge"", slowmo shootouts, vengeful cyborgs and psychotic superhuman killers.

People will hate it for having a weak storyline, underdeveloped characters or whatever (that's their problem).",1150502400,5,616,5.222222222222222
911945,4,630468682X,"Angel cop started well enough, to keep me watching each episode to the last. Much of the story seemed like a action story with shootings, car chases, and plenty of explosions. Then the anime took a supernatural twist with the telepaths, teleporters and firestarter, and the showdowns against Lucifer. Lucifer was too powerful she had the ability to levitate herself, people and objects and killed anyone with her grip. Many of the scenes were very gruesome, with blood splatters, guts and lots of profanity to boot.  I understood what the creators were doing when they named characters Angel and Lucifer. I knew they were trying to convey their own version of the world apocalypse. They conveyed this well by making Lucifer almost invincible and very sadistic. In one scene she ripped a woman in half and a man was reduced to a pulp of blood. In another scene she got shot in the head and had her arm ripped off, but she healed herself and grew a new arm. The animation and character design was excellent though a bit outdated by todays standards. The sound effects were good, but sometimes a bit subdued and drowned out by the odd music. An Epic battle contained in a six episode series with pretty good action. I must comment that the english dubbing sucked. For adults only. All episodes continued. Ends on episode 6. I also recommend the anime mini-series called, ""Iria"".",1076976000,12,1375,4.7531380753138075
911946,3,630468682X,"""Angel Cop"" is an ultraviolent collection of anime episodes that deals with future Tokyo's falling apart. It's very standard in terms of animation and setting. The plot, concerning big corporate bad guys, futuristic cops, and weird ghost people, couldn't be more convoluted or full of holes. But it's the action that holds up the movie and gets it its 3 1/2 out of 5 from me. The characters are almost entirely forgettable, but developing characters isn't the movie's mission. The film is out for blood, violence, and death and it gives all in its two and a half hours runtime (which feels shorter than it is). As sci-fi, ""Angel Cop"" is strongly lacking. As action, it works almost too well.",1039478400,3,691,4.766666666666667

Let me say ive been disapointed a few times with short or pointless ones but this is superb.  Not only dose this fully go into one of the best story lines ive seen but this sucka is 6 freakin hours long.  Can you imagin my surprise when i was used to 1/2 or 1 hour movies.

911950,5,630468682X,"It's kind of strange how I ended up buying Angel cop the collection.  I had seen a commerical for this once that showed Angel taking her helmet off over and over again, because her partner was shocked to find out this his  new partner was a tough, female cop (Angel). After seeing this cheesy  commerical I thought that it something I definately didn't want to waste my  time or money on.  Later on I saw a review for this series in an anime  magazine it sounded interesting enough.  The thing that made me finally  decide to give it a chance was the length and at that time I was buying  anime based on length hoping to get more for my money which is definately  not a recommended strategy for purchasing anime. I was extermely lucky with  this one.
This is one of the best cop shows in all of anime. There is  plenty of story, action, violence, profanity, and interesting characters to  satisfy any action-junkie.  Also Angel's ride was pretty phat!
The  drawback is the dubbing.  It wasn't all that great. Some people did some  extremely bad acting and when other people cursed it sounded  forced.
Based on the amount of graphic violence, strong language, and  nudity I would recommend this to mature viewers 17 and up.",957484800,13,1222,4.548387096774194

The  character Angel is at first drawn poorly, but then, somehow, she looks  better and better.

Angel Cop is not a great anime by any stretch of the imagination to me. Nor is it anywhere near close to the worst anime has to offer either. I have heard many mixed views on this series, and for the most part, it appears to be either a love it or hate it; but to be completely fair, I have heard legit reasons from both sides. In any case, I have always been in the middle with this one.

Angel Cop definitely has a few good features and some really bad ones too. It's similar to Ninja Scroll in a way. It knows exactly what it is and doesn't try to deviate from it. Foremost, this is a very brutal action series with a very dark setting to compliment the serious nature of it.

When creating a series or a film with a dark atmosphere. It's not only important to create the character personalities that properly meshes with the environment. The film should also maintain its identity throughout. This is the main area Angel Cop truly excels in. You never forget you're watching a serious and violent series. There is no comedy relief or random jokes just tossed out there to lighten up the mood. Nor will you see the exaggerated big faces of surprise or sadness with the over sized tear drop. This for me is one of the biggest attractions to Angel Cop. I simply have a hatred for series and films that are suppose to be truly dark and serious, then you'll have random comedic segments that completely ruin the atmosphere. Hellsing: Ultimate is one series that falls victim to this clashing of genres.

The action and violence in Angel Cop can either be its strength or achilles heel all depending on the person. The death scenes are disturbing and well animated. The gore is in good detail from people taking bullets to the head on to being fried like lobsters. I was taken by surprise a little bit when I first saw this many years ago. There is one sick torture scene that truly brings out the cruelty in humanity to the fullest.

Angel Cop is an entertaining series in some ways but it definitely has its glaring flaws. The writing definitely deserves a mention. The first half was pretty good and the story was a bit gripping. Later on, it takes a turn and becomes only a splatter fest and characters you already didn't care about are being taken out as if they were so important. One character even dies an undeserved dramatic death. After learning next to nothing about them, it was very hard to care about this person.

The animation is hit and miss. The visuals can be pretty good, and the gore isn't the only thing well done: character designs, landscapes, and the use of lights were well detailed and animated. However, by the last two episodes, you can see it suffered from budget restraints. The animation and artwork was very inconsistent and downright bad(as not in good).

I also have small issues with the setting. The series is suppose to take place somewhere in the future, and some of the technology concerning some weapons such as high powered guns, heavily armed motorcycles, and cyborg suits back up its futuristic claims; but the people's mannerisms such as taste in garments, hairstyles, and the fact disco is alive and well takes away that futuristic feel to me.

The series also suffers from some crude dialogue with a lot of forced cursing. I'm a fan of cursing toons but the profanity even grated on my nerves, and reached the dark realm of ultra annoying. There is also a lot of bad voice acting and cheesy lines too. The stand out line definitely has to be, ""If this is justice, then I'm a banana"". When drunk, high, both or sober, I laugh hysterically at this.

Angel Cop does have a decent plot and it's not completely mindless. There is a slight bit of character development on the part of the main character Angel. She's also a likable character in some ways due to her fearless and cold demeanor. The series also touches on themes such as patriotism and government conspiracies. Plus, the death scenes can be imaginative as well. The series goes out of its way to keep trying to shock the viewer with the death.

Overall, Angel Cop is wasted potential to me. I feel it was wasted because of a low budget. The budget was definitely the issue because the series was finished over a five year period through 1989-90 & 94. The effort was there, Angel Cop had some very good ideas, plot twist, and characters introduced; but a six episode format clearly wasn't enough. The series needed at least thirteen episodes because it felt very rushed. The longer run time could have pushed it to being a very good anime. Overall, I recommend this only to the action starved. If gore and action is your cup of blood, then this will most likely quench your thirst. To others, I recommend skipping it completely.

Pros: Lots of bloody and gory action, good pacing, consistent theme

Cons: Crude and sometimes annoying dialogue, inconsistent animation,  writing is sometimes questionable",1413590400,,5489,4.640576725025746
7875797,5,630468682X,Classic Japanese animation at its best. A must have for Japanese anime fans everywhere. This is the cartoon that got me into anime.,1394409600,,131,4.739130434782608
7875798,5,630468682X,"Angel Cop was released in 1990 and it was one of the first anime I saw. My UK VHS copy needed replacement and I was pleased to find that a DVD replacement was available. All the elements remain. This is not a version for young children. It's violent, graphic and has a lot of swearing. This is a style of animation and dubbing that you just don't find anymore. It's a shame that this has gone away as anime has become more popular in the US. To me it fits with Jin Roh and Cyber City Oedo 808 and these are gems amongst the drangon ball dross.
When I review things I prefer not to spoil the plot but if you really need to know what happens before you see it check out the wikipedia entry, it's quite good. The last few minutes of the final disk are a bit weak with a couple of vital things unexplained. You might also find the plot somewhat familiar especially if you've seen the Ghost in the Shell series. This came first.
This rare anime is well worth a watch.",1360454400,2,962,4.149732620320855
7875799,5,630468682X,"I really liked this. I've watched tons of anime and take it as seriously as any true fan. I like the more cerebral stuff like Rah Xephon, and Technolyze too, but this is one of my favourites. There is a good level of swearing, but not as much as the other reviews led me to think. The animation is also better than what it sounds (Check out the first graphic scene where a head is blown open)  As for the voice dubbing, again this isn't as bad as other reviews make it sound. I've heard far worse choices than this. I thought the voice acting for the main characters was really good. They had the right attitude to pull off the anarchic nature of their on screen characters. You can't take this one too seriously, it's not that kind of anime. It's crazy, and that makes it funny. It's a fun ride, not a thought provoking one. You can get a handle on the plot in the other reviews. The only reason it might be confusing is because certain elements involving anti-semitism were rightly changed. Nothing has been deleted, they just altered the dialogue, even on the subtitles for the Japanese language.",1285718400,,1099,4.4405940594059405
