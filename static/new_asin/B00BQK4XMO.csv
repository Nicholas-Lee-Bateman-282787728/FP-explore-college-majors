5666599,5,B00BQK4XMO,"I can't believe I now have the first part of season two of the Beetleborgs! I have the whole first season that I got hooked on and now I can watch what happens after the Magnavores are put back in the comics and the Beetleborgs lose their powers, but gain new ones. With the lovable monsters of Hillhurst back in action with the Beetleborgs, along with a new friend, Little Ghoul, who can resist this suspenseful, thrilling ride as they cheer on the Beetleborgs to defeat their new archenemies with their cool new powers!

If you like Power Rangers, or you know someone who does, get this series to own! It is created by the same people that write Power Rangers. Big Bad Beetleborgs and the Metallix rock!",1410307200,,705,4.5078125

5666601,3,B00BQK4XMO,I got The Big Bad Beetleborgs Metallix Season 2 vol. 1 but when I got it I got a broken case with it.,1397520000,,101,3.4347826086956523
5666602,5,B00BQK4XMO,I have bought all three available volumes of Beetleborgs and I love them as it allows me to relive this classic series that was created by the man behind Power Rangers. If you are a fan of the show and are just waiting for the final volume to be released I highly recommend that you don't wait and buy the current three that are out now either straight from them or on here brand new where they well get the profits so that they can release the final volume. If you are not getting these because it is already on Netflix don't rely on that forever as one day it will no longer be there and all you well have left is bad quality of the episodes online this is a way to own a piece of your childhood.,1396483200,,698,4.028776978417266
5666603,5,B00BQK4XMO,I loved watching this show when I was a kid. I hope that they decide to release the rest of this series. I'd hate to think that I'll always have an incomplete set on my shelf at home. I want the rest of the show.,1395187200,2,212,3.7333333333333334
5666604,5,B00BQK4XMO,"This is what the 90's are made of. Most importantly - Shout Factory, it is stupid realising half a series and not giving us the other half. It should have been all 35 episodes on 6 dvds in 1 case.",1394409600,3,196,3.925
5666605,5,B00BQK4XMO,I like the shows I wish they where still on and made a movie about them I do hope to get the last set when it comes out soon that would be great thank you,1383782400,2,154,3.4285714285714284
5666606,5,B00BQK4XMO,wish you had completed the season instead of just 18 episodes I really wanted to find out how the beetleborgs officially defeated the crustaceans,1382227200,,145,5.083333333333333
