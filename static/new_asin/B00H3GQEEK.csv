8629441,1,B00H3GQEEK,"I hate the disc --- not the movies. It has always been difficult to play this particular blu-ray disc (I understand that a huge part of the problem stems from the fact that this is a BD-R --- not a regular studio-produced blu-ray. BEWARE!). On the few occasions when it decides to load, it takes quite a long time until a menu finally appears, with lots of strange noises. I watched one of the movies last night. Now I can't get my blu-ray player (LG BD645 3-D blu-ray player) to open, despite my trying every method under the sun. Seriously. Because of this one disc, I now have to buy a new blu-ray player.

My suggestion: If you love these movies like I do, track down the individual films and buy them (most of them are Public Domain and pretty cheap). While it seemed convenient (and saved me a lot of space) to have them all on one disc, it's really not worth risking your machine.",1498435200,4,887,4.343373493975903
8629442,1,B00H3GQEEK,"My SONY will not play it reliably and when it does the quality is poor. Also, How can you title this ""The Old Dark House"" and not have the classic ""The Old Dark House"" movie included . . .",1492473600,,188,3.8461538461538463
8629443,4,B00H3GQEEK,"I would have given this disc 5 stars!  But it's cool having a collection that includes not only THE BAT, but all 24 of these mystery movies!!!",1454803200,,142,4.2592592592592595

What a fun assortment of movies.  All the old tropes are trotted out...but they're old tropes for a reason.  Some movies in this collection are played for fun...others are much more serious but they're all entertaining.  The transfers are a little shaky here and there but my biggest complaint was the sound quality on some of the movies.  I had to jack my volume sky high just to hear what was going on.

All in all, well worth the time and money.",1405468800,,539,4.520833333333333
8629446,2,B00H3GQEEK,"The Blu-Ray will not play on my Panasonic BMP-BD60 Blu Ray player!  I had it out and in the player over the last few days and it is not being recognized by my player.  It says ""No disc"" every time I try to play it.
It's not defective because it plays fine on my Maxmade portable Blu-Ray player.  I can also play it on my computer with Power DVD 13 and a Samsung Blu Ray drive.
I have every film in this collection in other DVD editions.
Of course I was not expecting this to look great, but I wanted to have all these films in one place and I thought that it was a good thing using a Blu Ray blank to store them.  There are even a few films here that look to be upgrades from other copies I have.
But not being able to play this on my big screen TV is a problem.
Another thing that was disappointing was that CAT AND THE CANARY and THE BAT, two silent films, seem not to have intertitles but they are sub titled instead!  I have only spot checked these two and was surprised to see all these subtitles while the actors are speaking.  Not sure if intertitles are totally missing or not.  I found this to be rather annoying.
And NO folks, THE GHOUL is nowhere near the quality of the MGM DVD as some posters here and other places are thinking.  It's not as good as the UK DVD either.  I have both.  The UK DVD has a good audio commentary also so DON'T even think of replacing that with this copy!
Some of the titles spot checked slightly better than their Alpha, etc counterparts, but not all that much.
MURDER BY INVITATION, one of my favorites, has a phony title card that is lifted from the trailer and I noticed a few other instances of burned on monkey business during opening and end credits also.

Sorry this is only my first impression of this set and its not very detailed as I have not yet done any serious watching, but I wanted to get this warning out to everyone first.

Bottom line:  Don't get rid of your older copies of these films before you buy this as there is the possibility it won't play at all!  If you don't have a lot of these films, you will get a good buy if you can play it.

If I actually do play many of these and find any plus or minus features I will try to remember to add to this post.",1402012800,12,2217,4.064367816091954
8629447,5,B00H3GQEEK,"The fact that these movies are not 1080i is of no consequence, I would love to have them all in better transfers, But that is never going to happen, so just love the ones you're given. The price for these is probably the sticking point for most people,  You get 24 movies for $24.99 That's less than $1.04 per movie and most are real good transfers some are bad but much better than what youl'd get in some of those multi pack movies. Some of these movies I've never heard of and I'm a film buff. Go buy this set.",1394841600,7,513,4.13
8629448,5,B00H3GQEEK,"Although the transfers are SD, this is a great collection. The transfers are great. Some of the prints used look pretty good considering that they are low budget largely independent productions from the 1930s. Transfers are superior to Alpha's and other PD releases. As with other Firecake collections, the British titles have the superior transfers. THE GHOUL is a knockout transfer. Surprising to see CHARLIE CHAN'S SECRET here, as it is not in the public domain and is available from Fox, but it is a most welcome addition to the collection. Highly recommended disc!",1392940800,8,569,5.0638297872340425
8629449,5,B00H3GQEEK,"Although this is a blu-ray, notice that you are not going to get the high resolution most blu-rays are capable of (1080p). If watched on a large screen (I have a 46"") one movie (And Then There Were None) is pretty blurry and jerky. However, on a small screen (a blu-ray portable with a 9"" screen) it looks pretty good. In comparison with the VCI Entertainment blu of the same movie, I couldn't see any difference between the two, which means that they are probably the same transfer. But I paid more than half of this collection's for the VCI blu by itself. Other movies I have watched so far are comparable to what I have on DVD such as Charlie Chan's Secret or the Thirteenth Guest. But the plus is the movies I don't have and 23 movies for a low price. Topper 2 is one of my favorites (Billie Burke and Patsy Kelly together are very funny). So I would highly recommend this set because there are many gems in it. If you are fan of the movies from this era it is a great bargain.",1392940800,12,981,4.223404255319149
8629450,5,B00H3GQEEK,"So excited to see all these great movies on Blu Ray! I have a few of them but to have them plus more I don't on Blu Ray, and to have them all together on 1 disk (Blu Ray version only) is so wonderful! I love movies with the ""Old Dark House"" mood. Some collections have other movies I would prefer not to have but this one looks perfect. Thank you for puting this together. I can't wait until February 17th! :)",1391385600,3,409,4.0
