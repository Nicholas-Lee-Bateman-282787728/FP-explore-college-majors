5104338,5,B007PVHBAE,"My godson's three favorite holidays are Christmas, Halloween, and Shark Week.  He loved this gift and watches the past two seasons all year 'round.",1360454400,3,147,5.125
5104339,3,B007PVHBAE,My son is totally obsessed with sharks. He got this movie for Christmas. The second episode is very graphic and gory. There was no warning and it is rated PG. I fast forwarded through several parts. The other episodes were all very interesting.,1357171200,3,244,4.6976744186046515
5104340,5,B007PVHBAE,"To me Sharks are the king of the deep blue sea & ocean. There are over 300 different kind of sharks. To see them glide through the water and burst with such amazing speed for there size, its just awesome! Anyone who likes to watch sharks & learn about them this DVD is the one and more!! You can't go wrong. I have all the shark weeks. There just Jawsome!!!!!!",1356652800,2,360,4.1571428571428575
5104341,4,B007PVHBAE,I do not usually buy educational or documentary blu-rays.  I really enjoyed this blu-ray and learned alot from it.  I bought this blu-ray because I have liked sharks and wanted to see huge sharks close.  You will know why people are willing to put their lives on the line to discover what they discover.  Sharks are even more fascinating to me than before.,1347667200,,356,4.603174603174603
5104342,2,B007PVHBAE,"Like the other reviewers have already said, 3/4 of the episodes are on other (much better) Shark Week collections. The episode ""Blood in the Water"" can be found on the ""Jaws of Steel Collection"", ""Ultimate Air Jaws"" is available in ""Restless Fury"", and ""Myth Busters Shark Special"" can be found in ""The Great Bites Collection"". The other episode, ""Great White Shark: Uncaged"" could have been much better if they would have cut out all the shots of the crew talking and goofing off. I'm very surprised that they deemed the ""25th Anniversary Collection"" only worthy of 4 episodes of which, only 1 is ""new"". If you're looking for some good Shark Week action, I'd suggest the ""20th Anniversary Collection"" or ""The Great Bites Collection"". This will be the last time I ever pre-order a Discovery Channel video.",1346025600,28,805,4.883211678832117
5104343,3,B007PVHBAE,"This release is OK given the price I paid. I was disappointed to find out that it is just collection of four episodes. They should just call it ""Shark Week: Four Random Episode Collection"", instead of something like ""25th anniversary"". My two year old did enjoy it so that is great. Picture quality is great. They also need to do a better job in story telling.",1344902400,,360,4.46969696969697
5104344,1,B007PVHBAE,1 Start is for the release the episodes are good and if you don't have any of the other DVD releases it's a nice mix of episodes.  The 20th Anniversary DVD set was great it had a ton of episodes and was a box set.  Not that they need to do a big box set every anniversary but this is just a bad release 4 episodes and 3 of them are on other Shark Week releases so really if you are a fan and have the others like I do you are buying it just for Great White:Uncaged.,1344643200,3,465,3.7346938775510203
5104345,5,B007PVHBAE,"This is not only Fascinating, but simply amazing, especially to the curious mind. I grew up as a Beach Lover with the Ocean a best friend, and the mysteries of the Sea remain Fascinating. We are introduced to tropical locations, shark footage, and reminded about that scary and thrilling movie ""JAWS."" I once saw a dead Great White as it was carried out of the water in Florida, an image you don't forget. This film was very interesting and enjoyable, especially for all those simply mesmerized by the mystery of the sea. Highly Recommended!",1341532800,2,541,4.76595744680851
5104346,5,B007PVHBAE,"Normally I wait to buy new items until a few dozen or more reviews come in - but I went ahead and took a chance.

 The top five reasons I pre-ordered:

5.  Features tropical locations I'll never get around to going to

4.  Undoubtedly chock full of Australian Accents

3.  Hours of grainy stock shark footage

2.  Classic MythBusters episode in 1080p

1.  Kari Byron in a swimsuit in 1080p (so I have a thing for smart redheads - so sue me)

*I will update when it arrives - until then, stay out of the water*",1335657600,4,509,4.177083333333333

5104359,1,B007PVHBAE,"Love shark week, but was disappointed in the episodes shown.",1437091200,,60,5.1
5104360,5,B007PVHBAE,Great to watch! Great price too!,1432425600,,32,4.5
5104361,5,B007PVHBAE,Love it! Very satisfied!,1426896000,,24,5.25
5104362,5,B007PVHBAE,It doesn't get any better than this shark movie. It changed everyone who went to the show 25 years ago. I happen to have a grandson who is really into sharks. He loved this gift. It's good to be the Grandmother.,1419552000,,211,4.170731707317073
5104363,4,B007PVHBAE,"Helped my mom buy this for my nephew.  He loves sharks.  He loves watching documentaries of sharks.  But after watching this DVD, he can no longer watch documentaries because it shows the sharks biting people.  Wish there was a warning ...",1417392000,,239,4.7560975609756095
5104364,5,B007PVHBAE,Really enjoyed it; especially Blood in the Water!,1407628800,,49,5.25
5104365,5,B007PVHBAE,I really enjoy this dvd. It's got everything in it. It's educational and entertaining!,1407196800,,86,5.214285714285714
5104366,4,B007PVHBAE,Very good movie/documentary on the 1916 attacks.  I read the book and the book doesn't acknowledge the freshwater attacks could have been a second (bull) shark.,1403740800,2,160,5.153846153846154
5104367,5,B007PVHBAE,"My son loves sharks---I got this for him---I know its awesome but there is no way in 'the hot place' that Mom is gonna watch this. Um, no thank you!!!",1395878400,,150,4.033333333333333
5104368,2,B007PVHBAE,"I'm not really a huge fan of Shark Week or anything (I mean, it's okay), so I actually bought this for the Mythbusters episode.  The other three episodes on here (Great White Shark Uncaged, Blood In The Water, Ultimate Air Jaws) are fine enough, but I primarily bought this set to get my hands on the Mythbusters Shark Week Special.

I'm a huge Mythbusters fan and have been trying to get my hands on all their episodes, so this seemed like an economical way to get the ""Shark Week Special"" into my collection.  Unfortunately, and for anyone who's trying to do the same thing, you should be aware that the version of the Mythbuster's Shark Week Special on here is an edited version that 's only half as long as the normal one.  YES, it's only half the episode!  Imagine my shock to find out that half the special was missing!

I've since done a bit more research and discovered that you can get the proper full episode on the ""Shark Week: Great Bites Collection"".  Aside from that, even if you're not specifically a Mythbusters fan and just want to watch shark-related shows, you'd get a better value for your money choosing some other Shark Week collection, such as the ""20th Anniversary Collection"" which has many more episodes on it than this.  Either way, whether you're a Mythbusters fan or a shark fan, I can't recommend this DVD at all - there's better options out there.",1395014400,,1378,4.573170731707317
5104369,4,B007PVHBAE,"If you have never seen any of the episodes on this disk then go ahead and buy this as all the episodes are very good. The problem (as others here have mentioned) is that 3 of the 4 episodes were already published on previous DVDs. Here are the episodes:

Blood in The Water - this episode is about the shark that terrorized the New Jersey area in 1916. There were several fatal attacks in Matawan Creek and the surrounding area which most people believe was caused by a great white shark. This true story became the basis for the movie JAWS.

Ultimate Air Jaws - this episode has lots of video showing great white sharks jumping high in the air while going after either real or decoy seals. Chris Fallows, the photographer and shark reseacher, takes lots of risk to film these sharks jumping high out of the water.

Mythbusters Shark Special - a mostly silly but interesting look at some myths about sharks. Do magnets act as an effective deterrent for keeping sharks away? How easy is it to poke a shark in the eyes to stop an attack? They build a pretty nice robo shark to test this idea.

Great White Shark: Uncaged - this is the only new episode. Shows a group of divers determined to swim with sharks without the safety of being in a shark cage. Does it seem like they are taking unneeded risk and putting people's lives at risk? Yes, but it is fun to watch from the safety of your living room. This was my favorite episode.",1394064000,2,1429,4.381132075471698
5104370,2,B007PVHBAE,"I love Shark Week so much on the Discovery Channel , When I seen this Bluray on sale I quickly bought it because it said ""Anniversary Collection"" , In a collection you expect lots of Episodes and Footage and what not...This came with about 5 Episodes. Totally not a collection.",1392854400,,277,4.56
5104371,5,B007PVHBAE,This was a birthday gift for my cousin. She's really into sharks and she loved this DVD. It was a perfect gift for her.,1381104000,,119,4.0
5104372,5,B007PVHBAE,I love this product. I got this for my brother for his Birthday and he LOVES it. It was shipped and packaged very well! I highly recommend this product!,1375142400,2,152,4.275862068965517
5104373,3,B007PVHBAE,only 4 different episodes. would recommend purchasing this product if it had more than just four shows to watch. the best show that was on it was ultimate air jaws. the myth busters special was too long and drawn out. i cant even remember the other two shows names that were on the dvd if that explains how boring they were.,1374364800,,324,4.327868852459017
5104374,5,B007PVHBAE,Many hours of watching this video over and over  LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!! Bought it for my nephew for Christmas and he just loves it!!!!,1363824000,2,129,4.608695652173913

5104376,4,B007PVHBAE,"Overall I liked this one, It said the host was Jamie Hyneman but he only appeared in the Mythbusters episodes on the disk. Special FEatures are non existent on this disk as well. But I did love the episodes available so overall I was satisfied.",1361750400,,244,4.444444444444445

8520754,1,B007PVHBAE,This is not the Discovery Shark Week. Its a phony.  The label seems to be printed off of a home printer.  It is a home made movie made from movie clips.  The problem is its not worth the money to return.,1513296000,,203,3.902439024390244
