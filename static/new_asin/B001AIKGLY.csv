This helped my anxiety disorder and my body in so many ways it will be something I keep in my life for many years. I started this in 2007. Rashelle it's very kind and replies frequently on social media site as well as an email if you ever have questions or concerns. I recommend this to other all the time because it is so gentle. I have all of her work out DVDs , including her stretch band DVD workout. I use this technique for my mind body spirit and soul to balance all in one.

8277614,5,B001AIKGLY,This is by far my favorite breathing program. There is a testimonial/review from someone named Heather on Amazon. I have seen her reviews of this product in many places. She is obviously a very devoted Lifelift customer and so am I. That is something you will find if you pay attention to reviews found all over the internet. People are really devoted to this program and have stuck with it for a very long time because of that. I find it easy to do and it is without a doubt the most rewarding.,1409270400,5,495,4.333333333333333
8277615,5,B001AIKGLY,"In my view, bodyflex and oxygenlift are strictly the same teaching. The teachers are differents and teach differently but the technique is the very same so, buy whichever document you feel like. For my part, i have this dvd from Rashelle Haines as well as the bodyflex book. The thing is that practicing breathing exercises every day, apart from doing sport of gymnastique is a very good idea. I have my lotte berk routine every day, of body toning, but i walk a lot and use this wasted time to practice discretely some breathing exercise, from oxygen lift and it helps me a lot. about 30 reps a day have slimmed down my lower body, it have helped my a lot with my digestive system and have stopped my ""sinus bad breath"" so, I am very happy with this",1372982400,8,750,4.402877697841727
