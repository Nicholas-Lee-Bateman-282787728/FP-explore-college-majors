2542733,3,B000EXDRZI,"I LOVE this show and wish more seasons were available for purchase.

The star deduction is for the packaging.  This set comes in two skinny dvd cases with a sleeve.  One of the cases was fine, but the second arrived broken.  The ring of plastic teeth holding the dvd in place by its inner ring was broken, so the Dvd flops around in the case.  I thought about sending it back, but as I had already written my name on the other disc with a sharpie, I figured they wouldn't take it back (also, I'm lazy).",1437955200,3,502,4.1875

2542773,5,B000EXDRZI,I enjoyed watching this show when it aired on television and love being able to watch it whenever I want.

I Like this show SOOO much !1 It's so funny and i can identify with Dharma so much , with her laid back personality, the way she jokes around with everyone , only thing is is that MY parents aren't hippies !! =D I would reccommend this show to everyone I know and also tell them to check out all the other Movies and TV shows that these actors and actresses are in . Like Criminal Minds ( TV show ) and Touched ( Movie with Jenna Elfman ) Both of these are also 5 Star entertainment !!!",1374796800,,613,4.074380165289257

2542795,5,B000EXDRZI,"I'd pretty much forgotten about this series and what an incredibly well made hoot it was until I bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/British-Cinema-Collection-2-4-Films-The-Inheritance-Love-Among-the-Ruins-Anna-Karenina-St-Ives/dp/B009ERK1ZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">British Cinema Collection 2 - 4 Films: The Inheritance, Love Among the Ruins, Anna Karenina, & St. Ives</a>&nbsp;from Amazon a few weeks ago. Thomas Gibson (a k a ""Greg"") plays the romantic lead in the made-for-TV movie of Louisa May Alcott's ""The Inheritance,"" which was made in the late '90s when D&G  was still going strong. He was great in the role and that reminded me how much I'd loved this series--how hilarious and well written and well acted and warm and fuzzy it was--and I wanted to see it again. All of it. So I came here, bought the Season One DVD, watched the whole thing in two sittings, and now I want more. Is that ever gonna be possible?

While the Amazon index has links that purport to send customers to a page that accesses D&G's full run, all a click gets you (at least at this writing)  is this page where all that's offered is season one (terrific!) and a region 2 DVD of season two.  If anyone here knows why that's all that's available (because the rest of the series was never put on DVD? Or because it was but sold out and there's no hope a new batch will be forthcoming? Or that it's worth checking back here every now and then to see if there's more to come? Or what?)

No, I don't think I would have been able to jump on Greg's bones that fast, but I sure would have tought about it!!  In my younger years I think the family would have disowned me.......But now that I am older,  I would jump on my cycle and head for the open road with Greg...........

2542835,5,B000EXDRZI,Found this show in re-runs and really enjoyed it.  A wonderful 'culture clash' comedy (60's hippies v establishment types) that really pokes fun at the hypocracy on both sides of the culture (as well as the virtues).  Jenna Elfman is as gifted at physical comedy as Lucy and Thomas Gibson is a wonderful straight man for all the craziness swirling around him.  Wish the remaining seasons were available.,1302652800,2,403,4.897058823529412
2542836,5,B000EXDRZI,Dharma and Greg is an awesome series and I'm heartbroken that season 2 has not been released yet in Canada and the US.

2542839,5,B000EXDRZI,Buying this first season collection of Dharma & Greg brings back good memories of simple TV comedy.  I love watching Thomas Gibson.

2542870,5,B000EXDRZI,"This is an all-time classic example of two different worlds attempting to live together.  Dharma is your typical Pagan child, open in dialog and free of restraint.  Greg is your typical Christian, straight-laced and firmly embedded in the corporate world.  The way the two learn to live together in a marriage that to both seemed destined is just hilarious!  Rarely in television are we treated to such a pefect cast.

Some might say they are too stereotypical but I think instead the points to be made between the two worlds have never been done quite like this.

I think Thomas Gibson is one of the most underrated actors around.  He is simply, here, a great comic talent, and that's something we don't get to see on his new series, Criminal Minds.

I must note that it is a refreshing change to see a married couple on television that have a normal even keeled relationship.  It is good to see that the husband is not some wimpy man controlled by an over domineering wife.  They have a balanced relationship.  Bravo!",1196208000,,487,4.528735632183908

I have never understood why this show didn't last longer. In an age of really stupid ""I don't deserve my wife"" sitcoms, this program reminds us that it is possible to have a smart and engaging show about new marriage. Although the initial premise (a couple meet and marry on the same day despite wildly different lifestyles and beliefs) was a bit farcical, a superb ensemble cast held it together with finesse. This show handled serious, realistic situations with uncharacteristic grace and humor. Many times, it could have gone down the road with cheap gags and one-liners (and sometimes, to be honest, it does) but the situations are usually quite well-thought out.

Totally worth the cost and then some. This is NOT your typical stupid sitcom. For people jaded with today's sub-par crop, pick this up and remember that there are actually comedy writers who are funny, or at least there were in the recent past!",1173312000,4,1174,4.98469387755102

2542890,5,B000EXDRZI,"This is one of my favorite sit-coms of all time. It is a story about how a, love at first sight marriage, between to people from COMPLETELY different backgrounds develops. How the families of the newlyweds cope with each other. And all the colorful characters they meet along the way. Dharma, a bit of a ""Lucy type"", is from a full blown hippie family upbringing. Complete with VW van, commune living, vegetarian mother, burn-out father, protester rally family vacations. Gregg on the other hand is from a conservative, Republican, affluent, country club family, that has aspirations of their son being a politician. Watching these two families muddle through their very polarized beliefs, to try to get along is hilarious!

I was so glad to see that Season 1 had been released so that I could pick it up and, I have to confess, I have not stopped watching the entire first season.  This is a laugh out loud sitcom that is just pure fun.  The opposites attract premise of the show works well especially in the ""fish out of water moments"" that both Dharma and Greg go through when they are placed in unfamilliar situations.  All-in-all the show works well though.  The casting was great and the jokes never got stale or redundant.

About the DVD's themselves, the only draw back is there is not a ""play all"" option which means you can't just put the remote down and kick your feet up.

Also, the DVDs are made so that episodes 1-4 are on one side while episodes 5-9 are on the other.  This normally isn't a problem but if you have one of those ubber sensitive DVDs where even the slightest blemish makes the DVD skip frames then be extra careful when prying the DVD from the package.

The extra features are nice though and I was glad that a cast interview remembering the sitcom was included.

Very poorly done so I would doubt even fewer people bought that one. But Dharma & Greg is so fresh and they should give it another chance and release more seasons.  If a company doesn't plan to release all the seasons of a show based on sales, then they should release it as a total package of all season involved in a limited quantity.  That way those who really crave a series can get all the seasons and the company won't have to wonder about ""gee should we or shouldn't we release anymore season"".

2542932,4,B000EXDRZI,"Dharma & Greg Season One follows the marriage of two polar opposites. Greg is from a conservative, straight-laced old money family, while Dharma is the product of a pair of free spirited, 1960s communal hippies. The pair bump into each other while transferring from a San Francisco subway car. Greg arrives at his office only to find Dharma sitting on his desk waiting for him. They run away to Nevada to get married the same day and then the fun begins.

There is a great chemistry between the cast members and the writing is well above average. The series is loaded with great humorous situations. The actors do such a good job that you actually believe that these people could be found living in your neighborhood.

The set includes cast commentary on certain episodes, a few outtakes (some of which are ""hidden"" in the artwork of the title page of certain episodes-you simply press your remote control's select button until you come upon one), Episode Vanity Cards, and a ""Making of Dharma & Greg"" feature with the creators and several cast members.

The one thing that I do not like about the set up of each DVD is that you cannot choose to ""Play All"" the episodes on a disk at once. You need to select an episode from the root menu, watch that episode, and then, after the episode has ended, return to the root menu to select another episode to watch.

People who are already fans of the show will enjoy this set. For newcomers, I would suggest that you catch a few episodes in reruns before purchasing the set.",1163030400,,1517,4.5661764705882355

Whenever I go to shopping in to video store, I asked for the Dharma & Greg DVD. I was unhappy because of the same answer:NO. But now I am in Turkey and I never calculate the cost of S&H and US$ > Turkish Lira rate to buy. I saw in the amazon I ve just ordered in 5 seconds. And why?:

Jenna is not just playing Dharma, She has a part named Dharma. Maybe not the spiritual part, but fun and childish part. You can notice her ""improvisation"" (Sorry if it not the real mean. I cheked from dictionary) She scream, jump, yells, kiss, hugs etc etc. Also there is a proof that these are ""improvisation"" Greg is just laughing while watching her. I am not sure is he really love her in real life but I am sure he is in love with Dharma. (Also I am) Not because of he is acting. He loves her just because she is natural.

Also don't forget to have a paper and pen to take some notes (from Dharma's sayings) especially if your marriage has some problems or you are going to marry.

Because their first motto is comprehension. Take some notes and use them in your real life. (Actually you can read some summary about these thoughts, from Chuck Lorre's vanity cards at the end of the end credits)

Finally why ""Thanks to Fedex"", because I choose cheapest shipping method and it took 18 day to get here. Don't make fun of me about I am cheap. If I've choose fastest shipping, I had to pay about 29$ for that (DVD set was $28.76!!!)",1161475200,5,1533,4.117056856187291

Every actor in the show was EXCELENT, as were their characters/characterizations.  Some of the story lines bummed me out (like the Kevin Sorbo affair character) or weren't as great as the characters, but this is definitely a high spot for TV comedy.

2542938,4,B000EXDRZI,"Others have listed the episodes and their descriptions, so I'll just add some food for thought.

Watching the whole first series, in sequential order, is a real eye-opener. The writing was fantastic and the characters delightfull, but what was truly great about this show was the way it just drew the viewers into these people's lives, the way it dealt with pregnancy scares, criminal backgrounds, menopause, meeting the in-laws, spicing up one's sex life, career changes, personal politics, alcoholism, fear of commitment, identity crisis, jealousy, fear of change, and marriage--all in the first season, and all with a sense of levity that is lacking in much of today's popular television! Watching these 3 DVD's, I laughed until I cried.

Also touching are the commentaries done by the actors that play Dharma, Abbey, and Larry. They truly loved their time working on the series, had a great fondness for their fellow actors, felt at home in the sets (they point out details about the O'Neil/Finkelstein kitchen, and the Finkelstein/Montgomery living room that you probably never noticed, and tell amusing stories about props), and are always willing to laugh at themselves (""Abby's"" tales of her ever-changing hair and her real-life husband, who was the inspiration for Larry, and how he beat up Goofy at Disney World, are well worth listening to the commentaries...also not to be missed are ""Dharma's"" descriptions of eyebrow do's and don'ts, and ""Larry's"" tips on where to buy hippy clothes).

My favorite moments in this season of the series include: watching Penn (of Penn & Teller) play a man who thinks he is a housecat, seeing two young women trying to cook their first Thanksgiving dinner manage to lose a live lobster, watching Greg attempt yoga, watching Laurie Metcalf (of Roseanne) play a psychotic self-defense instructor who invades Dharma's nightmares, and seeing a woman with gothic make-up, dreds, and black fishnets walk down the aisle in a pink bridesmaid's dress, followed by a rather tall drag-queen on the arm of a short groomsman.",1157328000,43,2057,5.134328358208955

The video artifacts are the worst I've ever seen, even compared to DVDs obviously made from OTA TV images. But the bit rate should be more than double that of Firefly, and looks like much less than half. Both DVD sets come from Fox, BTW.

However, the packaging in the DVD set absolutely blows.  I mean with the standards established in TV series being released on DVD it's inexcuseable that a series released today is this bad.  My list of complaints:

1.  3-4 episodes per disk (rather than the standard 8 or so)

2.  The disks are double sided.  There are 8 or so episodes per disk but only 3-4 PER SIDE.  This is like in the old days of laser disk where you had to flip the disk over to see the rest of the movie.

3.  No Play All feature.  It was long established that people like this feature but it's not available.

4.  The main box contains two smaller boxes each containing 1 or 2 disks instead of the standard single fold out container that has all the disks commonly found now (i.e. Simpsons, Fraiser, etc.)

2542966,5,B000EXDRZI,"1997 saw the arrival of a new sitcom that helped reinvigorate the romantic comedy on network television. Even though it wasn't particularly original, Dharma & Greg it was a very well-written and well-made show featuring two leads that had undeniable chemistry together. Since the show went off the air and entered syndication, fans have wondered when and if it would finally be released on DVD. Well, the wait is finally over.

Some highlights from this season include ""He Ain't Heavy, He's My Father,"" which sees Larry going ""underground"" after he fears a routine background check will uncover his ""radical"" past. When Greg finds out that Larry doesn't actually have one, Dharma and Abby create a folder with a checkered past for Larry to ""steal."" This episode showcases just how funny Alan Rachins is - Larry isn't too bright (one too many acid trips back in the `60s perhaps?) and his cluelessness is the source for a lot of the episode's humour.

Jenna Elfman brings a lot of bubbly charm to the role of Dharma. It's hard not to be taken in by her sexy, girl-next-door looks and her character's nave optimism and New Age ways. Thomas Gibson is perfect as the good-looking straight man to Elfman's loopy Dharma. He's full of inhibitions and being with her helps loosen him up some. They work so well together and make a very believable couple. They balance each other, she's a hopeless romantic and he's the practical one and it is a lot of fun to watch them play off each other. Despite their differences, Dharma and Greg make it work because they truly love each other.

Dharma & Greg, like any successful sitcom, offers personalities that anybody can relate to whether it is the optimist, the realist, the hippies or the conservatives. What makes the show work is that because it is a sitcom, you know that ultimately everything is going to be okay and that's what people want to see. In fact, we are seeing the world predominantly through Dharma's rose-coloured glasses during the age of Bill Clinton when the economy was doing well. The show reflected that domestic, democratic bliss with Dharma as the Clinton-esque goddess who wins out. We need another show like that now in these dark and scary times. At least watching these episodes now they can act as a kind of security blanket, a gentle reminder of how good things were and how they can hopefully be again.

The first disc features an audio commentary on ""The Pilot"" by cast members Jenna Elfman, Mimi Kennedy and Alan Rachins. They point out friends of cast and crew members, comment on the nuances in each other's performances and even spend a little time catching up with one another in this fun if not frivolous track.

The second disc features a commentary on ""He Ain't Heavy, He's My Father"" with the same participants. Everyone gushes about the set design of Dharma and Greg's apartment and how it changed over the series, pointing out where certain artifacts that decorate it come from.

The third disc features a commentary on ""The Official Dharma & Greg Episode of the 1998 Winter Olympics"" by the same participants. Apparently, they all had a lot of fun making this episode, getting into the spirit of the Olympics and gently making fun of the excitement that always surrounds it.

""When Worlds Collide: The Dharma & Greg Story"" is a retrospective featurette. Most of the cast, with the notable exception of Thomas Gibson, are back for this featurette and talk about such things as how they were cast and recall their favourite moments on the show.

""Vanity Cards."" Lorre started writing vanity cards that would appear for two seconds at the end of several episodes. All the ones for this season are included. Most are incredibly funny and very witty as he espoused his ""personal beliefs.""

Finally, there is ""Reaching Your Inner Dharma,"" a trivia game where you have to answer ten questions to see how close you are to thinking like Dharma.",1150416000,18,3918,4.784023668639053
2542967,5,B000EXDRZI,I love this show. Someone commented that it's a show much ahead of it's time and I agree! I can't get enough of it. Funny yet profound. I can't wait for the other 4 seasons to be released!,1150329600,5,188,3.973684210526316
2542968,5,B000EXDRZI,"This show is the best! I love everything about it. Dharma & Greg are a great combination. I loved the wardrobe and hair that they came up with for Dharma!! Abby & Larry are hilarious, Stinky & Nunzio are too cute and the Mona Lisa Beaded curtain is too awesome. The whole show is just way too funny. If you're ever in a bad mood, watch Dharma & Greg and you'll cheer up right away. I even named my dog Dharma thats how much I love this show. Just too cool.

THANKS FOR FINALLY PUTTING THIS SHOW ON DVD!!!!",1149897600,5,505,4.101010101010101
2542969,5,B000EXDRZI,"One of those  rare comedies that is smartly written, funny, philosophical and pulls you in to really like the characters.  Seven to eight wonderful actors, not just the one or two at the top.  Lots of stories that ring true to a human family experience, even when brought to the ""wacky edge.""  I always enjoyed these shows and am glad to see that I can recycle my old VHS-taped-off-the-tv episodes; at least for season 1.  YAY!",1148774400,4,427,4.565789473684211
2542970,3,B000EXDRZI,"Other than ep #21 (the ballroom dancing contest episode), season 1 wasn't that great, in my personal opinion, even though overall I believe this is one of the best sitcoms ever made; amazingly, shockingly underrated.  It is no surprise why there are so many positive posts, grateful this show is FINALLY coming to DVD!

Much like Sports Night, I think the biggest problem is that this show was just ahead of its time, but probably more than that both shows fell victim to ABC's insane management who were beyond obsessed with ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire"", to the detriment of every other show on their schedule.

Although, compared to today, when many new sitcoms don't even make it past half their first season (Jenna's ""Courting Alex"", for example), I guess one just has to be grateful Dharma & Greg made it to five seasons!",1146960000,10,829,4.703448275862069
