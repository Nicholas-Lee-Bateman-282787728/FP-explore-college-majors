3763947,2,B001QDF5VE,"I just received this video and honestly can't stand it. The workout itself is pretty good, not as advanced as I thought it would be.  Jari is SO annoying, she is working out in leather pants and as she is working out she says 'whew, I am sweating, I'm not much of a sweater but I know Kristen is'  How embarassing for Kristen, the girl who is working out next to her.  I found out she is only 45 years old and her face looks 60.  She has great arms, but a pot belly, in her leather pants, and no rear end at all.  Compared to Karen Voight and Kathy Smith, plus all the Firm videos, this one is way way at the bottom.  I wish I would not have gotten it.  Don't waste your money, buy Karen Voight or the Firm videos instead.  Try the 500 calorie Firm workout.  Now that is a great workout!",1242000000,5,787,3.9935897435897436
3763948,5,B001QDF5VE,"The latest Jari Love dvd is a departure from the previous ripped dvds. The look and the feel is much different. Jari and the Rippers are dressed up and the set has changed. So has the workout. It is much like the previous ripped dvds but much more challenging. In previous ripped dvds Jari will do an intense compound exercise followed by one where you get to lay down on a step and work the arms giving your legs a break. There are no breaks here. All of the exercises are compound exercises combining upper and lower body work. Examples are pulsing squats and lateral raises, lunges with rows, and dead lifts with rows. Jari shows all exercises without a step and in the back row advanced Rippers are using a step. The first exercise was a lunge with a row and I used the step which was a bad idea. I consider myself to be an advanced exerciser and I also run 6 days a week and the first track wiped me out. The exercises are very intense so if you usually use 10 pounds for bicep curls I suggest you go down a few pounds. In some exercises simlar to the ones done in previous ripped videos I was able to user heavier weights. But this one is much more intense so I used lighter weights. In some exercises I had a hard time challenging my muscles because the weight for my arms was too heavy but I was used to holding more weight for my lower body while I said my muscles did not feel that challenged I am pretty sure if I had used heaver weights that I would of strained myself. Overall this dvd is very challenging. I opted for the one hour track, there are three options. You can do the first half for 30 mins or the second half for 30 mins or both tracks together. If your pressed for time and want to work your abs I suggest you do the second half because that includes the ab workout which is pretty easy and takes up about 10 mintues. It consits of push ups, planks, crunches and the bicycle. Overall most of this dvd consits of compund exercises combining lunges with upper body work, squats with upper body work and dead lifts with upper body work. If you are new to Jari's workouts I suggest starting with Get Ripped! with Jari Love which is compared to this dvd is less intense it is still in my opinion an intense workout but not as hard as extremly ripped. Then after doing that dvd for a few months trying this one. This dvd is extremely challenging but an awesome workout. I also suggest you go light on cardio the days you do this dvd because it is hard and you will need energy to get through the whole hour.",1241827200,38,2527,4.212371134020619
3763949,4,B001QDF5VE,"Jari includes two fantastic 30-minute workouts on this DVD that can be done separately or combined for a super challenge. This is similar to her previous Get Ripped workouts, in that it includes high reps with light weights, but it is shorter than the others so you can still get a great workout if you're short on time. This strength training workout moves at a non-stop pace to really fatigue your muscles and rev up your metabolism. Jari uses compound exercises, meaning you use your upper and lower body at the same time, so you get a cardio benefit while toning your muscles. As in her other workouts, she includes the calories burned per minute before each exercise and the amount of weight needed for the upcoming exercise. The only equipment required are hand weights (she uses between 5-12 lbs) and an optional step. Jari does not use the step and you'll get a great workout without it.

I've included a breakdown of all the moves below with a brief explanation. Jari splits the exercises into 5 ""tracks"" per workout that usually consist of two different exercises that work complimentary body parts (such as the quads & hamstrings) and you perform LOTS of repetitions alternating sets of these two moves. I've indicated which is move #1 and #2 below. You'll perform perhaps 20 or more reps of one move before switching to the other move and then you'll do it all over again. Thankfully, she has a clock that counts down as you do the last 30 seconds of each move. As usual, Jari switches up the tempo and number of reps to keep things fresh.

>>>>> Workout 1:
Warm up with Squats, Alternating Lunges w/ Hammer Curl, Biceps Curl, Shoulder Raise, Shoulder Press, Upright Row
- Lunge Row and Stiff Leg Dead Lift: (1. Reverse lunge with simultaneous back row, 2. deadlift to work hamstrings)
- Pulse Quickie Squats with Knee Lift Bicep Curl: (1. Squat from side to side, 2. balance on one leg while lifting the other knee and doing a bicep curl)
- Pulse Wide Squats/Around the World and Step Up Pec Presses: (1. Plie Squat combined with shoulder lift to front then side, 2. March in place or onto the step and do overhead shoulder press)
- Tricep Butler and Side Squat off Bench/Anterior Raise: (1. Sort of a curtsy squat with leg lift to the back combined with triceps press, 2. Squat to the side and combine with shoulder raise to the front)
- Balancing Act and Side Squat/Lateral Raise: (1. Balance on one leg while performing a knee lift or front kick then perform a reverse lunge, 2. Squat to the side while doing shoulder rise to the side)

>>>> Workout 2
- Clean and Press and Step Knee Hammer Head (1. Squat then left weights overhead in a shoulder press, 2. Back lunge then knee lift with simulataneous hammer curl for biceps)
- Moving Side Squat Lunge Back & Knee Shoulder Press (1. Step out to side and squat, 2. then overhead shoulder press combined with knee lift followed by a squat)
- Horizontal Rows and Narrow Squat: (Back Row then squats with the feet close together then add knee raise)
- Reverse Flies and Overhead Triceps Extension: (works your back, then the back of your arms. Your perform the fly while lifting legs to the back)
- Pushups and Plank/Abs: Lots of pushups alternating with planks
Includes 8 Min Abs Bonus that has crunches, triceps pushups, planks, bicycles and bridges with leg lift.
- Cooldown with a full body stretch

Cons: Jari is a little more chatty in this exercise and as always her ""motivational"" speaking aggravates me a wee bit. Also, sometimes she moves a little fast, so this workout is more for the advanced or intermediate exerciser. I also don't like that she does not include the number of reps for each exercise, however, she does still include the recommended amount of weight to use.  These are minor details, and wouldn't prevent me from doing the workout.

Overall, I like this workout DVD and will definitely use this for days when I'm short on time because it's a scorcher. I couldn't give this 5 stars because there just wasn't enough variety.",1241740800,56,4013,4.629213483146067
3763950,5,B001QDF5VE,"I have been doing Jari Love's workouts for a few years now, and just finished Workout 1 + the 8 minute abs routine on Extremely Ripped.  I have NEVER been so sweaty or so out of breath during a Jari Love workout before!  There are no breaks, so have the remote nearby to pause for some water - you'll need it!  There are two-30 minute routines, plus 8 minutes of abs, and an 8 minute stretch at the end.  You have the option to do both 30 minute routines together for a 60 minute workout.  If you want a full-body workout incorporating high reps, low weight, and some serious heavy breathing, Extremely Ripped is what you're after.  If you are familiar with the Ripped series, you'll get a kick out of Jari in Extremely Ripped.  She's full of more funny and quirky commentary than usual - and if it is any indication of how hard-core this workout is, even Jari gets sweaty!",1241740800,4,873,4.351851851851852
3763951,5,B001QDF5VE,"I love doing all the ""Ripped"" workouts, but this new one is by far the best and the toughest of the series.  If you are looking for a challenge, this workout is for you.  Jari has you working both upper and lower body in most every routine and then engages your core as well.  There are no breaks; your heart rate will be soaring.  I had to press the pause button more than once just to catch my breath and get a drink of water.  You will love this total body workout.  I wish I could give it a rating of 10 stars.  Enjoy your new Ripped workout and the new Ripped body it will give you.",1241481600,6,587,3.965811965811966
3763952,5,B001QDF5VE,"If you like Jari's Get Ripped! Series of workouts, you're going to love Get Extremely Ripped! The sound and quality of the DVD are fantastic. Jari's instruction is clear and easy-to-follow and as always, her personality is warm and friendly. This is a challenging high-rep workout without any breaks between sets, so be prepared to sweat! There are two 30 minute programs that can be done separately or done together for a full 60 minute heart-pounding session.

This workout is done with handheld weights; you can choose whichever weight is most comfortable for you (3 lb to 8 lb). This workout can also be done with a step, but this is totally optional. Each person on Jari's workout team is using a different weight which is identified on screen along with the amount of calories each person burned during the workout while using that weight. There were two people using a step during the workout, but the others were not. There is also an onscreen clock that pops-up to inform you that that you coming to the end of a set.  The clock worked great at encouraging me to really pump-it-up and give it my best, because the end was in sight.

I have to be honest, I personally could not utilize a step during this workout, I would probably collapse, but what is great about this workout is that there are so many options. Using the step is a goal that I have set for myself along with increasing the weight of the hand weights. This workout will continue to be a challenge for me and that is one of the many things I loved about it.",1240272000,59,1531,4.5

3763954,4,B001QDF5VE,"This DVD includes two thirty-minute workouts of compound weight exercises plus a warm-up, abs section, and stretch. Done all together, it clocks in at around 80 minutes, but it can be broken into two separate workouts. Doing compound weight work means you sacrifice heavy weight work for lighter weights, but it also means you get a great cardio workout along with effective toning. You'll burn a lot of calories, especially if you do both workouts together. But it does have a bit of a dread factor for me with its repetitive nature so I give it four stars overall. The music is a bit dull too. But the instructor is wonderful--enthusiastic and encouraging. I have many of her workouts, and they always deliver.",1462665600,,712,4.796747967479675

3763978,1,B001QDF5VE,"Wow.  Where to start?  First I have been exercising for 20+years.  I am intermediate to advanced, but with age, I can't do all the things I used to.  I like fitness dvd's and own many ranging from Cathe, Jillian, Jackie Warner (one of my faves)  Kathy Smith, Illaria, Kelley Coffey to name a few.  Im pretty open to trying new routines as long as I know it will be enjoyable and I am getting a good workout.

Years ago I bought Jari's first dvd ""ripped"" and enjoyed that it was a full body weight workout using a barbell but I found it boring as all get out and the music was so horrible (sounded like weird swami music) I eventually stopped doing it and got rid of it.  Fast forward to now, I was intrigued that Jari was getting all these great reviews on her newer dvd's that I figured I'd give her another try ...but it was with great hesitation.  Seriously, if I didn't get this 4 pack for a deal, I wouldn't have done it.  So here goes.....

The sets on these dvd's are dark as others have commented.  I read another review that mentioned some of her crew seemed ""skanky"" and  I'd have to agree with that statement.  What the heck is with these workout outfits?  I get Jari said that the workouts were ""themed"" industrial & tribal...but wow, fake leather workout outfits?  Or whatever the heck those were...with animal print trim?  lol.  They were tacky.  Onward to the music.  It's not good.  I'd even go as far as to say it's bad. There were a few tracks I could handle, and she did seem to get more into Techno these days, but I guess I'm just more into something a bit more fun and lighthearted in so far as music.  Aside from the cardio/dance tape, which wasn't all that great, the rest I could barely tolerate.

Now I feel bad for blasting Jari herself but here goes.  This is exercise.  You are doing it so you and look and feel great not to mention improve your health and be healthy!  Sorry to say but Jari doesn't look all that healthy to me. She's way too skinny.  If the camera adds 10 lbs, I could only imagine what she looks like in person.  Her hair looks fake, and so do her teeth.  I'm not impressed here, at all, and I DON'T want to look anything like this so Im finding hard to keep motivated doing her tapes.  Personality wise, I couldn't hack that either.  Its the same monotone over and over and to be honest I'd rather listen to Leslie Sansone's idle banter then hear the dumb comments Jari makes.  Examples:  ""Im not a sweater"", asking members if they got a baby sitter, and seemingly joking with them about  being ""fired"" and being a ""cheater"" on their exercise reps?  Guess Im just not a fan of her, her personality or her exercise dvd's.

So, on to the exercises.......the reason I am here.  Some of them are good, some ok, but I'm shocked how she doesn't even perform a full squat or full lunge at 90 degrees.  Its all these little ""pulses""  with no full range of motion to work your lower body to its full capacity.  Her upper body stuff is ok but again I'm not sold on this light weight heavy rep method.  I feel that all the reps she does are breaking down muscle as opposed to building it.  And she is the proof. Sure I think you can get toned from doing this, but to be honest, in my opinion, I've seen many better workouts.

I guess someone could get a decent workout out of this, but unfortunately I doubt it will be me.  I'm just too turned off by it all and found these dvd's as well as Jari herself rather bizarre.

I will try to do these again and update this if I change my mind, but right now I'm considering sending them back. Its just not my style and or what I aspire to.

I'm Sorry Jari....I really wanted to like you second time round :(",1414108800,7,3688,4.2417266187050355

3763995,1,B001QDF5VE,"I have nearly every Jari Love video so clearly I like her work.  I wanted to like this one as well since it has six short workouts and it is a Bootcamp style which I was hoping would be a change from her other workouts.

The editing is awful.  There is a screen which features a picture of Jari and some tips before each workout.  However, the workout starts immediately after the screen cuts off.  There is no way to know what weights to use or what you will be doing.  The workout appears very choppy and disjointed as a result.

Some of the exercises are good, but not in the bootcamp style in the sense that they are not based on body weight or calisthenics.  There is a man who does every cardio segment on a stationary cycle.  I don't see how that is bootcamp related, or how that would be accessilble for the home viewer.

The cardio sections are high impact and not engaging.  One involves jump squats that feel as if they go on forever.  When you are standing in your living room staring at a TV screen it is vital that the exercises be visually engaging or the boredom becomes unbearable.  While Jari says there are modifications, the modifications tend to be very uninspiring like walking in place.

The pace also seems rushed.  For example, in her other workouts Love emphasises the importance of getting a 90 degree angle in a lunge.  Here however everyone seems so rushed that no one is getting down very far.

This is a total disappointment for me.  I do recommend just about any of her other videos but this one is getting donated to the library.",1376006400,5,1562,4.4020979020979025
3763996,5,B001QDF5VE,"I started using Jari Love's workout videos in March of this year. Within two weeks, I started noticing a difference in my arms and thighs. I do not need to lose weight or have a weight problem, I do it for toning, and now, 3 months later, I have gained 7 pounds of muscle. My clothes fit better and I feel great. I am really happy so far and I alternate between videos. I do a video for about 4-6 weeks, then either switch the dvd, or up my weights. I could never do pull ups, pushups, etc. before these videos, now I can and my strength is only increasing. I never write reviews for anything I buy, but I can honestly say, that these videos are finally the workout I can enjoy in my own home at my convenience!!!",1372118400,,713,4.1
3763997,4,B001QDF5VE,"i like jaris videos because she doesnt walk around alot checking others form and commenting she does the workout and is feeling the workout like anyone else. she is getting older so she doesnt go all out in this video. she uses lighter weights and doesn't go as deep on lunges and squats, but i still enjoy her attitude. for some reason i like when she talks to the others in the video.
i don't like that she has the man in the back. he is doing the high level intensity form of the workout and should be center not stuck in the corner.
if you have seen one of her videos you have pretty much seen them all but her body is amazing and i don't know why but i enjoy her personality. she doesnt annoy me, she actually makes me happy and i want to watch her. i like her body and even though ill never look like that its still motivation for some reason.",1364774400,,849,4.089820359281437

By the end of it I could really feel it in my arms but I have noticed even just doing this for the first week that my body is really toning up and for those who like weights this is an excellent workout. You really will see a difference, I think this one is even a bit tougher workout than the jillian michaels shred one. Because you are always moving and the cardio is up pretty fast. And this is excellent cuz its a good length movie also so you really are getting the bang for your buck. Jari is a real positive down to earth person and I love how she explains the benefits of the excercises and how the video shows the weights of what each person is doing and modifications for when you are first starting. I think she's one of the better fitness instructors out there. I have done ""alot"" of different fitness videos trying to always look for something challenging for me or to switch up my workouts to make the day fun. this one is definently a challenging one and you definently burn alot of calories doing it. You won't be dissapointed getting this video,if you are looking to burn alot of calories quickly this one will do that for ya.",1364342400,4,1201,4.295154185022026

I don't like how she counts down the seconds, it's like;oh my goodness just get it over with already.; Seems a little boring at first.

I like almost all of Jari Love's workout videos and this one holds it's own very well with the ones I already have. It also has 2 separate workouts that are supposed to be approximately 30 minutes long where you can do one for about 30 minutes or combine them for one long workout.  My only reason for knocking off a star is the fact that if you try to do only one of the ""30 minute workouts"" you turn out to be working out closer to 45-50  minutes if you include the warm up, cooldown and an abs/floor workout that immediately follows the ""30 minute"" part of the workout.  I think the breakdown should be made more clear for those who have limited time and think they can truly do her workout in 30 minutes.  I still recommend this video as it is a serious calorie burner but those with limited time for workouts should know that you will have to allow quite a bit more time than 30 minutes to complete it with a warm- up and cooldown included.",1354233600,2,1026,4.209183673469388

But it's a tough workout, I am not able to get thru it without many breaks. The use of a step is optional, I used it on some of the segments like her up up down downs! Still worth doing!",1342051200,,317,3.676470588235294
3764009,5,B001QDF5VE,"I must preface this by saying I haven't done a lot of workout instructors' DVDs - I've only done Jari Love and Jillian Michaels and I love them both as workout instructors.  Well, I did buy a Cathe DVD and sold it after one try.  I have 7 Jari Love DVDs and they are awesome - this one and Get Ripped and Chiseled are my favorites, with Ripped and Chiseled being strictly weight training, no cardio.

This DVD is really great - sounds like a lot of reviewers get kind of hung up on the outfits and the ""theme"" of the set, but really it's just a good workout, and Jari and the women she has working out behind her are AMAZINGLY cut (there's a guy in it, too, but he's wearing baggy shorts and a big t-shirt so I can't see how ripped he is!) - totally motivates me to keep pushing as hard as I can!

I had to rewind a few times at first to get the hang of the moves, since she changes a couple times as she makes the exercise more intense for the more advanced participant.  But I sure work up a good sweat and my whole body gets a fabulous workout.  I love that it's broken down into 30-minute workouts so I can still get motivated to do a good, solid workout even if I don't have a lot of time.

To do this workout you really only need a set of hand weights (I use plates and/or dumb-bells) and some good running shoes - I highly recommend the good shoes for cushioning and support, since some of the cardio can be high impact.  You can use a step or not, but I think a step really adds a lot to the intensity of this workout.  I have a step, so I'm not sure how this would be without it - and really I took my time buying a step because for some reason they are expensive - but I found one at Play It Again Sports for just under half of the retail price.  Since I work out a lot, I want to get the most burn for my buck, so I use the step for the workout and boy do my quads BURN!",1340755200,2,1881,3.900523560209424

Jari beautifully marries weights and cardio into a tough combination that will get you fit, particularly for endurance.  The videos don't push you to lift the heaviest weights that you can, but to challenge yourself to be able to stay within the 3 to 5 minute range for each muscle worked.  The side benefit?  By incorporating this style of exercise into my weekly routines, I have literally eliminated injuries.  Also, at nearly 50 years old, I should be complaining about arthritis and struggling with obesity based upon my genetic heritage. Neither could be farther from the truth. This is by far the safest and most effective workout.",1336608000,5,788,4.633093525179856

My favorite Jari Love workout DVDs are Get Extremely RIPPED 1000 Hardcore, Get Extremely RIPPED! 1000, and Get Extremely RIPPED. This one is a nice addition to these three. The first 10 minute segment had me worried as I felt it was not that difficult. However, after doing the full 60 minutes I was very happy with the workout and my quads were feeling the workout. I also liked having a Jari Love DVD that did not use the step at all. I enjoy using the step with the other DVDs but it is nice to have one that does not incorporate it in any way.

3764015,5,B001QDF5VE,"As is my custom, I usually pop in a workout DVD and watch it first before I actually do it. I bought this one based on the rave reviews. So, I pop it and grrrroooooaaaann. When I saw how she was dressed (black latex and shiny cami like shirts--even the assistants are dressed like that), I said to myself, well, guess I just wasted money on this. Even watching the workout, I was like oh boy...look at how easy her workout is and knew for sure I would be thrashing it. I usually do Jackie Warner workouts and Butt Bible levels 2 and 3 and this workout looked like it would do nothing.

So, the next night, I thought well, I have it so I might as well at least try it and see if it is as dumb and bad as it looks. And then WHAM! After the first set, I realized that watching it was not the same as doing it. This workout rocked! It was not so easy after all. I worked up a great sweat and really enjoyed it! This DVD comes with the bonus Ab workout too and liked that as well. Her cool down was awesome. I guess our parents were right when they said don't let appearances fool you. :-)

I still haven't fully got past the latex (or whatever that material is she wears) :-) but man, glad I bought this workout (there are 2 separate workouts-each with ab bonus and also option for complete workout--which is both combined), it is a great addition to what I have. Besides weight training, this one feels a little more cardio to me as well. Loved it. The rave reviews are accurate.",1334534400,5,1476,4.139372822299651
3764016,3,B001QDF5VE,"I enjoy a good Jari Love workout DVD, its just locating the right one. It seems some of the very early Jari Love DVDs could sometimes be cheesy looking with the assistants coming right off the couch slob routine, yet some of the newer DVD's take it to the far opposite with assistants looking like gladiators with too much theater make up and glitzy work out attire.  This is definitely a harder workout, which is ideal if you are looking to burn fat. I most certainly found my heart rate up and felt like I had used many different muscle groups. What I did not like was the way Jari's DVD's have taken on a new approach and look. The assisting group appear in some noveau garb that seems to be taken off the Vegas Strip or perhaps 'Fame' costume wear. I feel Jari's first 1000 series workout from 2006 suits my needs much better as it is more down to earth with assistants wearing what most of us typically work out in and the music seemed more upbeat and in tune with the format. I felt more like it was bringing the workout into my home rather than taking me to Vegas to watch tryouts for some new show or a fitness competition. I wish Jari would keep it real and resume some of her format from past DVDS, yet blend some of the difficult sequences she has on this DVD.
Overall it is a good workout, just try not to look at the group too much.",1332720000,,1345,4.213178294573644

Jari is a great motivator, her queues are accurate, she motivating and seems to be able to predict when I've had just about enough and pushes me on toward those last few reps that make all the difference.  She's not overly perky like some trainers I've used and she is not chatty.  Using the same video over and over, anybody knows those cute comments aren't cute anymore, they're annoying.

3764021,4,B001QDF5VE,"This workout rocks! You really CAN burn up to 1000 calories with the complete workout! Jari does the interval approach to exercise and alternates between cardio and strength training (perfect!). Your heart rate goes on a roller coaster ride and you torch calories. The DVD is well produced and the demonstrators have great form. The cueing was OK and this is the only thing that makes my rating a 4 star, rather than 5. Some transitions are not as well highlighted as they could be. but this is something you can definitely work through. Jari is motivating and upbeat without being annoying (big plus!).
This was my first Jari Love outing but will definitely not be my last. Highly recommended",1327104000,,693,4.783333333333333
3764022,4,B001QDF5VE,"This may be the toughest workout from Jari to date. It ranks up there with the Get Ripped 1000 and Get Extremely Ripped (some of my personal faves). The level of intensity is pitched more for the advanced exerciser and the cardio is almost entirely plyometrics (all high impact). If you have knee/joint issues, I would not recommend this workout.

This workout only requires handweights (no step in this one) and an optional jump rope. There is a 60 minute full workout, two 30 minute, or 6 10 minute workout. The warm-up and cool down is adequate, cueing is done well, and proper form is explained. The workout is organized into roughly 10 minute section, each section has an ab routine, a cardio group, and a full body (multiple muscle group) workout. I am a klutz who hates dancey workouts and this is not a dancey workout. These are largely basic exercise moves, they burn a lot of calories and build muscle definition. I would not rank this as super innovative but it is enjoyable. This is a solid strong workout that will probably appeal to folks who like Jillian Michaels, Jackie Warner, and Amy Dixon.

Minor faults: Some transitions occur too quickly. She provides tips between sets which I find a distraction and a waste of time. I wish these were on the bottom of the screen during the workout. The editing felt a bit sloppy (her earliest videos seem to have been put together better), this felt like it was produced quickly with less attention to detail",1326240000,16,1465,4.652509652509653
3764023,5,B001QDF5VE,"This boot camp delivers a great mix of cardio and strength training. If you love jumping around, this workout is for you!

What I liked:
- Options for the workouts. If you're crunched for time, you can do a shorter workout; OR, you can do just the cardio or strength training. Many exercise DVDs give you fewer or no options.
- Different intensity levels and options for each move.
- Good instruction and tips throughout the workout.
- I liked the music and they keep the movements in time with the beat.
- I love how she alternates strength training with cardio. This is a great advantage of her DVDs, IMO.

What I didn't like:
The only thing was that the one guy in the video doesn't do any of the cardio - he is on the exercise bike the whole time. This is really anti-intuitive because it isn't clear that he is doing interval training. This is a MINOR criticism, though. I do not think it detracts from the workouts other than being a minor annoyance.

3764024,5,B001QDF5VE,"I must admit that these videos are fast becoming my favorites. This particular video certainly didn't disappoint me!

This one gives you the options for workouts #1 or #2 - or the whole thing at once. I first did the workouts separately, then I did the entire workout!

Things I liked about the video:
1. The music - Jari & the gang were in sync with the music, which was the appropriate volume and tempo for the workout! Several videos I've used have background music that seems to serve no purpose, so it was a plus that the music was so prominent.
2. The mix, as with the other ripped videos, is cardio/weights/cardio/weights. I love this! It keeps things moving and gives your heart rate a chance to recover while keeping you pumped up.
3. The compound movements. Of course not a new concept, but I really like the way there didn't seem to be a wasted movement during the workout - curls, triceps kickbacks, arnold presses, etc. - were all mixed with leg movements (squats and lunges or various sorts). I just really loved the way my core was worked and my balance challenged by them.
4. The instruction with levity. Yes, Jari is serious enough and explains the movements, but there is some levity mixed in and it made me remember not to take things quite so seriously. Working out should be enjoyable, albeit difficult, right?
5. There are variations - both easier and more difficult - given for each exercise. There were times that I tried the most difficult level and at other times I stayed at level 1 for an extra rotation.

The video is supposed to let you burn up to 1000 calories. On doing the entire workout I got to the push-ups and had already burn 940 cals! Like the other 1000 dvds, this one delivers!

One word of warning! Be careful not to choose a weight that is too heavy! I found myself having to go to lighter weights on a couple of exercises. I also found that I still got a pretty good pump even though the rep count was high.

Solid video that delivers what it promises!",1325721600,6,1996,4.442622950819672

First, Jari reminds you to stay hydrated because ""water gives you energy,"" yet she doesn't give even a 15 second break to grab water.  The extremely short breaks between sets is just long enough to change your hand weights.  I find myself pausing the DVD a few times throughout the workout so I can grab a quick drink.  Second, on some of the routines, she doesn't keep track of the # of reps, so you end up doing more on one side of your body than the other, or (in the case of the squats in the 3rd track of workout 1) WAY too many singles on round 2 of squats after round 1 of biceps.  Her idle chatter is sometimes annoying, but for the most part I've learned to tune it out.  It really is a good workout & if you do it at least twice a week, you'll be able to increase your weight on certain tracks.

I wore a HR monitor and it showed that I  burned a total of 856 calories doing this workout,  but the best part is that even after my workout my HR monitor showed that I burned 175 calories after my cool down period. I ordered a few different DVD's from Jari Love because it's intense and that what I need in order to lose the last 32lbs. I want definition not just weight lose and her DVD'S provide this for me.

The music was some of the best I've heard in an exercise DVD, & all of the participants had perfect form for the different variations- and they are all buff, which I found motivating (they are slim, which I find inspiring, but not anorexic looking- they are obviously healthy, as they are ripped and able to follow Jari's lead with perfect form).

3764043,5,B001QDF5VE,"I started working out 4 days a week after baby #2, Jan 2011.  4 days a week I was doing atleast 30 min cardio.  But I wanted to step it up, and really tone my waist, thighs and butt.  I've lost all baby weight(60 lbs, lol) But my stomach and arms are ""flubby"". So I bought this Jari Love DVD after searching and searcing for an aerobic DVD.
I LOVE IT.

It takes 1 hour 20 min from start, to finish.  I have a step and 2 sets of weights.  3lb. and 5lb.  I feel like this is all the equipment that you need.  You don't even need the step because they show the whole video with either 2 or 3 people doing it without the step.

I started off with only the 5 lb weights, and then went and bought the 3lb too.  You are doing some serious reps in some of the workout. And having the light ones is way nicer.

You can do 1/2 the routine, or the whole thing.  Which is nice.  There are 3 levels of people to watch.  Level 1, beginer, 2 intermediate, 3 highest....I started with 1 for the 1st week.  Just so I didn't hurt myself.

So I've gone from a size 8 to a 6 in a month.  1st week I did workout 2 times, and cardio that week 2 times.  week 2, video 3 times and cardio once.  Took a week off cause I was sick :(  Week 3, video 2 times and cardio 2 times.
Week 4, well, its day 1 of week 4. And I did the video.

I would recommend it if you don't wanna spend alot of money.
I do it when the kids are napping.  Im really liking it.  I'm 5'6, 140.  Hoping to loose atleast 10 lbs by July.",1304294400,6,1480,3.777049180327869
3764044,4,B001QDF5VE,"This workout is seriously intense.  She keeps your heart rate up the whole time with various excerises that work several muscles at a time, and has different variations on how intense you want to go.

Her pace is quick and sometimes its hard to keep up, and its confusing in the beginning, but once you learn all the moves, its not so bad.  It was difficult for me to coordinate certain moves, but I may hav been trying to go too heavy at first.

I was extreamly sore after doing this workout, but of course, with consistancy, that won't happen as often.",1303776000,,554,4.401960784313726

Totals about 70 min. of fast-paced movement.  No twiddling your thumbs here.  The exercises are mostly fun.  Often times, I'll use 3 lb hand weights to make the cardio more intense.  The ladies are ripped and gorgeous.  Their bodies are inspirational as I know they didn't get that way via osmosis.  Long, lean and muscular - sign me up!

although the moves in the video are good, i got bored real fast because you do each move for like two minutes. maybe it's just me, but after two minutes of the same move, i adjusted to the move and no longer felt the effects.

i was really disappointed that this workout was so boring! i cant tell you how excited i was to start using this dvd, and how disappointed i am that i don't like it.",1300406400,,735,4.027397260273973
3764047,4,B001QDF5VE,"NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this DVD from the publicist.

Although I've used several of instructor Jari Love's early Ripped workouts and still own and love her original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Ripped-with-Jari-Love/dp/B000BTGY82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Ripped! with Jari Love</a>, this is the first DVD I have tried from Love's newer ""Extremely Ripped"" series.  Get Extremely Ripped Boot Camp features a more stage-like set in which Love and her four background exercisers (3 women, 1 man) are spotlighted.  In her Introduction, Love explains that Boot Camp contains six 10-minute segments, each consisting of abs, weights, and cardio (basically broken down as 2 minutes abs, 5 minutes weights, and 3 minutes cardio).  Thus the DVD offers a variety of workout options:  all segments can be played together for a 60-minute workout, the segments can be broken up into two complete 30-minute workouts, or the segments can be selected individually as complete 10-minute workouts when one is short on time.

The Main Menu of the DVD reads as follows:  Introduction--Complete Boot Camp--Workout 1--Workout 2--Warm-Up--Workout Segments--Cool Down.  Workouts 1 and 2 are complete 30-minute workouts consisting of the Warm-Up, Cool-Down, and 3 segments each.  The Workout Segments submenu breaks down each of the six workout segments by naming the abs, weights, and cardio exercises; I have done this in greater detail below.  This submenu also offers the option of playing all abs sequences, all cardio sequences, or all weights sequences, further enhancing the number of workout choices.  Please note that for the Warm-Up as well as the cardio segments, the male exerciser, Dean, rides an exercise bike as a modification; Love states that if you have an exercise bike, treadmill, or another type of cardio equipment at home, you should feel free to make your own substitutions as well.

Warm-Up (5 minutes)
Although Love suggests that the warm-up involves ""cardio intervals,"" the moves are very basic (toe taps, etc.), and really do not significantly raise the heart rate.  She uses the second half of the warm-up for some basic stretches.

Interval 1
Abs=knee isolation holds
Weights=lunge forward and back with knee raise; still-leg side dead lift in-between sets
Cardio=skier lunge

Interval 2
Abs=roll down to 1-leg push-up
Weights=single back rows from plank/double back rows from kneeling (5 sets!)
Cardio=jack tucks

Interval 3
Abs=crab (works abs/triceps/shoulders)
Weights=forward lunge with biceps curl/Arnold press; alternating front lunges in-between sets
Cardio=jump squats

Interval 4
Abs=shoulder push-up
Weights=lunges with shoulder press/knee-up; pulsing lunge in-between sets
Cardio=speed skater with hop

Interval 5
Abs=reverse curl with pike
Weights=anterior with alternating reverse lunge and side squat
Cardio=""Super Stars"" (quick-quick-slow scissor lunge)

Interval 6
Abs=rowing (led by background exerciser Lesley)
Weights=chest press/triceps (led by background exerciser Laurie)
Cardio=skipping (rope optional)

Cool-Down (4.5 minutes)
Love starts lying on back for hamstring and outer hip stretches; comes to standing for calf, hip flexor, and hamstring stretches.

In completing the entire workout, I encountered a few problems.  First, prior to the start of each new exercise, the name of the move and ""tips"" appear on screen.  However, the weights that the crew are using do not appear until later, making setup difficult.  Furthermore, for the weights segments, sometimes Love has already started the first few repetitions by the time the viewer gets to that screen.  I was also dismayed to see that the weights breakdowns are listed as ""Dean"" (the male exerciser) and ""Girls""; this was especially disheartening when it was these same women who were showing the advanced versions of the exercises!

Despite these issues, overall, this is a well-done workout DVD which offers many options to the intermediate to advanced home exerciser.  If you want high impact, high intensity circuit training, Get Extremely Ripped Boot Camp may be a good fit.",1300320000,7,4141,5.678571428571429
3764048,4,B001QDF5VE,"This may be the toughest workout from Jari to date.  It ranks up there with the Get Ripped 1000 and Get Extremely Ripped (some of my personal faves).  The level of intensity is pitched more for the advanced exerciser and the cardio is almost entirely plyometrics (all high impact).  If you have knee/joint issues, I would not recommend this workout.

This workout only requires handweights (no step in this one) and an optional jump rope.  There is a 60 minute full workout, two 30 minute, or 6 10 minute workout.  The warm-up and cool down is adequate, cueing is done well, and proper form is explained.  The workout is organized into roughly 10 minute section, each section has an ab routine, a cardio group, and a full body (multiple muscle group) workout.  I am a klutz who hates dancey workouts and this is not a dancey workout.  These are largely basic exercise moves, they burn a lot of calories and build muscle definition.  I would not rank this as super innovative but it is enjoyable.  This is a solid strong workout that will probably appeal to folks who like Jillian Michaels, Jackie Warner, and Amy Dixon.

Minor faults:  Some transitions occur too quickly. She provides tips between sets which I find a distraction and a waste of time.  I wish these were on the bottom of the screen during the workout.  The editing felt a bit sloppy (her earliest videos seem to have been put together better), this felt like it was produced quickly with less attention to detail",1299801600,5,1478,4.652509652509653
3764049,5,B001QDF5VE,"Wow, this video was difficult. I still can't get through the entire thing. I have worked out to Jari for about 5 years (skipping the ones she did with the ""dancy moves"") and I would love to know if her participants run through this entire workout without stopping. I thoroughly enjoy Jari as I feel working out with her consistantly gives me results. Be ready for a challenge!",1299715200,,376,4.544117647058823
3764050,4,B001QDF5VE,"I usually run in the morning, but in the winter I'm forced to run on the treadmill...which gets pretty boring. After reading other reviews I bought this workout video. I had never heard of Jari Love.

I enjoy the HIIT workouts because they keep you on your toes and not bored. The fact that you can do the whole routine or just half is a nice benefit as well (especially for those days when I can't get myself out of bed on time).  I feel stronger already after using this video on and off (alternating with another video and running) for about a month now.

Some negatives are... I'm not an expert, but I think her form is off occassionally, but the concepts and the entertainment are there. Also, you're supposed to hear the ""Tribal"" music, but it's kind of difficult to hear it.

I am also warning you there are a lot of squat like motions in this routine...which is not a bad thing...you're going to have an amazing butt and thighs!",1299715200,,936,4.393063583815029
3764051,5,B001QDF5VE,"I am an advanced exerciser, 24, and female.  I own most of Jari's workouts.  I'd say this one is just as challenging as Her Get Extremely Ripped and Get Extremely Ripped 1,000.  I wouldn't say it is a super solid strength training workout, but it isn't supposed to be.  It is a 'bootcamp' style workout that burns tons of calories and leaves you out of breath and sweating buckets.  There is a lot of shoulder work, you'll work them in four tracks.  There is some tricep work at the end, led by Laurie.  There wasn't a lot of focus on biceps.  The cardio segments are three minutes each of mostly high intensity, simple exercises.  Lots of jumping.  Unlike other reviewers I wasn't distracted by the guy doing doing his cardio on a stationary bike (Jari was just trying to show other options), Jari's outfit (she looks great and the woman can wear whatever she wants), or the new set; which I actually prefer over the old Extremely Ripped Set which was a little drab.  The music sounds a little 80's club mix to me but had a decent beat.  Overall I really like this workout and it is a nice addition to my collection.",1299628800,2,1117,4.421568627450981

3764053,3,B001QDF5VE,"I love(ha!)Jari's Ripped Series and mix them with Amy Bento and Cathe Friedrich to form the core of my home workout collection.  When I saw this workout with good review, I ordered it right away. I wanted to like this workout, I tried to like this workout...but it was just...weird.

I just did the full workout, so I can't attest to the numerous abridged versions contained on the DVD. It's a solid hour of sweat, but there are certainly more interesting and varied workouts out there.  It is very heavy on lunges and static jumping.  I do 1-1.5 hours of heavy workout each day, usually with 10lb weights or a kettlebell, and my knees and calves were cramping up from all the lunges and jumping.  Jari's strength has always been solid weight series that really challenge individual muscles groups.  Her cardio bursts have room for improvement in terms of interest.  I liked the bursts much better in the Ripped 1000 and Extremely Ripped 1000 workouts, but unlike here, she utilized the step.  Jari's form is sometimes off, and I found myself following Laurie all the time.

Production wise, the editing was sloppy.  I felt like each of the strength segments started immediately with no prep, no indication of which leg went first, etc...  Especially as it was my first time doing it, I had to pause, get the correct weights, figure out what the pattern was going to be, restart...it's annoying.  An easy, ""Ok, we're doing lunges (of course!) on the right foot, let's get those 8 lb. weights and 4,3,2,1..."" would have been nice.  The spotlight decor on the set was also strange and distracting.  My husband wondered if an alien mother ship was hovering above them. A softcore alien mother ship, because the music is definitely porny.

There is one guy in the cast.  During the cardio segments, he rides a stationary bike in the middle of the girls.  During the ab sections, he takes off his shirt, but it's inexplicably back on during the strength/weights segments. What's the deal?

And finally....Jari, either wear the girly ponytails, the spray tanned abs* OR the puffy red workout skirt.  Together it's like a ""Sexy Workout Instructor"" coed Halloween costume.

Jari--you are a good instructor and you have made some GREAT videos.  Go back to the good, solid videos with weight workouts that hit each muscle group, wear cute clothes that don't make you look like a goofball and gain 10 pounds.

3764054,4,B001QDF5VE,"After the trying the Lean Maching, I was worried this one was going to be a disappointment as well.  Its not bad, but its not her usual format.  Unlike lean machine, the entire hour workout is cohesive, so you can choose the 30 minute or full hour workout.  She uses multi-joint strength training moves that cause a cardio effect.  Every 3 move she does a 3 minute totally cardio invterval  that is plyometrics (but she does give you the option to use cardio equipment or modified moves if plyo is not your thing).  Overall great workout, and I hope she continues to create more.  Keep the workouts coming Jari.",1298505600,,611,4.5504587155963305

3764058,4,B001QDF5VE,"This really is a decent workout.  I use a step and feel like I get a good cardio, leg, and butt workout.  The upper body weight routine isn't as intense, but it's still decent and may give something different than your usual routine.  The entire workout is a little over an hour (more like an hour and 15 minutes) with the warm-up, two interval routines, and chest and abs section at the end.  I wore my heart rate monitor the last time I did the video and it said I really DID burn 1000 calories...not sure of the accuracy, but I was still somewhat impressed.

The workout is good, but the actual video leaves a lot to be desired.  The music isn't very loud and doesn't really get me ""pumped up"".  Jari and her friends are dressed in black and leopard-print spandex, and are so skinny and cut that they look like 14 year old boys with blond pony tails.  Jari even refers to a former weight problem she had while her 6-pack crunches mockingly at you.  So if you're one of those people who is more aggravated than motivated by ""skinny b*****s"", this video will probably just make you mad.",1296518400,,1087,4.3681592039801
3764059,4,B001QDF5VE,"Ordered this video based on the reviews and a magazine recommendation. Overall, it's a pretty good advanced-level workout. I've completed (and continue to do) the Insanity workout, so that is my basis of comparison (I haven't done or seen any other Jari Love workouts). This workout is hard but I didn't find it to be quite as hard as the Insanity workouts. I do plan to continue using it semi-regularly in addition to my other workouts, though.

One thing I do wish it had was a running timer like Insanity does - though it does give a timer at the last 30 seconds of each routine. The outfits, music and graphics are a bit corny, but since the point is to get a good workout, I don't think it's a big deal. Some of the queuing can be a bit off in a few instances, such as when she moves from level 1 or 2 to 3, and the cameras show the exercisers from the waist up so you can't really see what they're doing, but of course once you've done it a few times, you know what to do.

On the plus side - I like that it's an overall workout including cardio, weights and some abs/push ups. Also nice is that you have the option to do the whole thing, or only individual 'chapters' (cardio 1, cardio 2, weights, push ups/abs, if I'm remembering correctly). Some other reviewers mentioned lighting being an issue in other JL workouts, but this one seemed fine to me.  You don't really need any equipment to the workout, although a basic step and light dumbbells (3 - 10 lbs, depending on the exercise) will give you the option to increase the intensity (I use both).

Overall, if you are at an advanced level, I think this makes a nice addition to a fitness library.",1294963200,2,1658,4.321543408360129

The other reviews cover most everything.  I'll just add that compared to Get Ripped 1000, this video has more cardio, more ab work (Jari combines standing ab exercises into many of the cardio exercises), and burns slightly more calories.  I burn about 800 calories when I do all 70 minutes, use a step, and use 8 lb and 5 lb weights.

I was frustrated with Get Ripped 1000 because at the start of a new exercise the camera often showed only Jari's face, so I could not figure out the exercise until the third or fourth repetition.  That is not a problem here; the camera work is excellent.",1288569600,5,757,4.4963503649635035

It will definitely work up a sweat if you are using heavy enough weights.  I really love that you can choose different workouts.
Workout #1 (cardio and weight intervals)
Workout #2 (cardio and weight intervals)
Cardio only
Weights only
Push up and abs
Or just play the whole thing (which I have yet to do).

I am a little hesitant to do this more often, because the women are all very lean and ""ripped"".

It works up a very good sweat, but some of the cardio moves are a bit outdated.  i think a lot of workout dvds lack decent background music that keep me motivated throughout the workout.  This DVD has a sort of tribal/electronic music playing in the background that keeps you on pace/on beat with the moves.  There is also a timer that counts down towards the end of the intervals, which is nice.

The outfits are ridiculous (think 70's disco) and her chatter extremely annoying.  Having got past that it will really get your heart pumping and your muscles working. I love the split format of either doing the complete workout or being able to do just one of the 30 minute ones if time is short.  It's emphasis is more on the lower body than the Slim & Lean workout and as such you burn more calories, especially if you incorporate the step.  It does get a bit boring in parts but as I only do it a couple of times a week that's ok.  Just a side note: I completed Shaun T's insanity workout and now mix it up with one of those dvd's every other day and a Jari Love workout on the other days. A perfect combo of weights & cardio.

I recommend this dvd and will try her others down the road.",1287100800,2,950,4.053475935828877

I just couldn't get into the ""tribal theme"" - I prefer faster upbeat music that makes you want to move not something that reminds me of a 3rd world country with starving children.",1284940800,,510,4.0594059405940595

It is different from Get Ripped 1000 because there is literally no rest as Jari moves from cardio to strength training.  Get Extremely Ripped 1000 also gives you the option of two 30 minute workouts or doing it all at the same time.  There are also options to just do all cardio or just weights.

However, I've done several of Jari's other DVDs and in this one she looks too skinny, acts a little goofy, and rather than having good form she seems to be flailing around on some of the moves. The set is small and dimly lit.  Besides Jari, there are 5 background exercises.  One is doing the easy level, one is doing a moderate/intermediate level, and three are doing the advanced level on a step.  It's too many people doing different things so it looks disorganized.

Speaking of shape, Jari and her students are in the most amazing shape of any group of people I've ever seen.  The video is a series of 3 minute cardios sets, each in three progressive stages of aerobic difficulty, followed by 3 minutes of weight training.  All the moves are easy to perform and Jari shows many alternate moves, some to make it easier, some harder.  All the cardio sets can be performed with or without one or two steps and there is always someone demonstrating each level of performance.  I especially like the countdown timer that appears on the screen when there is 30 seconds left in the set.  It helps to keep you hanging in there to the end.  The total DVD is about 75 minutes from warmup to cool down, but is also offered in two 30 minute segments.

I did the whole workout (about 75 minutes including warmup and cooldown), without step, but transitioning to levels 2 and 3 on her cues. Calories burned, according to my BodyBugg: 369 (not even close to 1,000!). Granted, someone using a step and/or who weighs more than me, might burn more than 369. Still, 369 is the number of calories I burn during a 30-min interval run. (I am an avid runner so in pretty good shape.)

That being said, the DVD could benefit from a few enhancements.  First, the set is very dark and it's hard to see her back up exercisers.  Some are modifying the routines but you can't see them well and the camera doesn't focus on them.  Second, there is a 30 second countdown clock, but I'd really like to see a full set countdown so you know how much time you have left in the full set, not just the particular exercise.  Third, the music is kind of funky, I don't particularly like it, but it isn't overbearing so it's tolerable.  Fourth, Jari loses count and misspeaks a coupe of times.  That makes it seem a bit cheap - like they couldn't retake that section.  Fifth, there outfits are a bit 80s, the backup exercisers reminded me of Robert Palmer's backup singers in the Addicted to Love video.

Most of the items I have issues with don't affect the quality of the exercise, just diminish some of the enjoyment from the workout.  Other DVDs are much higher energy and more motivating than this one, so if you need some push then pick another DVD - maybe Chalean?",1274054400,2,1223,4.439461883408072
3764088,5,B001QDF5VE,"Just some background info before my review.  I'm an avid exerciser (5x/week - about an hour each day) for over year now.  I've lost over 30 lbs. and I am in the best shape of my life now at 31 with 2 kids.  I wear between a size 2-4 (used to be a size 12) and have more stamina and strength than I did at 18 when I was a ballet dancer.  I've been doing Jillian Michael's DVDs (Banish Fat Boost Metabolism & No More Trouble Zones) along with about 20+ other DVD's that are heavy on interval/circuit training with weights.  Jari's DVD ranks right up there with a few others that are my favorites.  Hers is BY FAR the toughest one out of all of my collection and beats all of Jillian's DVDs by a landslide.  I've even started dropping more weight and losing more inches again after plateauing for many months!  The 1st time I did Jari's (I did both circuits back to back too), I was completely exhausted and was so sore the next few days that I could barely walk.  Let me tell you that if you do this workout with the step, which is what I did, you will be getting an awesome cardio and strength workout (especially for your legs!) that beats all others and leaves you feeling great.  I have so much energy afterwards too.  By the way, when I rotate this with Jillian's now (Banish Fat Boost Metabolism), I barely feel like I'm working out at all.  Jari's workout has increased my strength and stamina far faster and much better than Jillian's ever could.  I'm now a convert!  (Sorry Jillian!)",1272844800,32,1490,4.31294964028777

First off, it looks like something out of the 80s, very dark, black sneakers, black spandex and odd leopard print tops.  Even the moves are basic aerobic exercises that I've been doing since high school.

Now, I did break a sweat, but I did not feel as though I got a great, well-rounded workout here.  Perhaps if I would've tried this before spending 3 months with Jillian Michaels and Jackie Warner DVDs, I would feel differently.  But with those DVDs, they are bright, energetic and more motivational - you also get a more well-rounded, full body workout.

All in all, I think this is a fine beginner workout as you can tone down the moves if you like, but most will probably bore of it quickly.  I will be sticking with Jillian and Jackie for now.",1272067200,5,853,4.3949044585987265

3764098,5,B001QDF5VE,"This is a great work out for any level. each interval is broken into three levels. You can choose to stay with level one the entire time or keep  up with the exercisers who are moving up to levels two and three. Having a step is optional, but really increases the intensity. Also if you choose to do only 30 minutes you can choose between the first or second half of the workout, each ending with the same pushup and abdominal routine as when the whole workout is played at once.

Jeri is motivating and easy to follow and her personality on the dvd is fun and down to earth, which is important because if you don't like the instructor you won't play the workout.

There are a couple of negatives but not at all reasons to not get this video.  The timing of the video editing is off. Many times when the camera cuts away from the whole shot of Jeri and focuses in on another exerciser, they are shown on the 'up beat' of the exercise while Jeri is on the 'down beat'. just as you switch to catch up , they cut back to a wide shot and you are off again. Once you realize this, it is not an issue, but it is annoying when the video is new.  Also if ou only do 30 minutes per workout session, you need to be sure to alternate between the two halves because in the first half you do an interval consisting of all 'basic right' moves which are not balanced out with the left leg until the second half.

over all though a great fun and intense workout.",1269648000,3,1446,4.128113879003559

They are the same moves that every aerobics instructor has used - absolutely nothing original and exciting. Jari didn't seem to really be doing the moves correctly, either. As I watched the people behind her, she didn't seem to give 100% effort. Her form was not correct and she didn't have much energy at all.

3764108,2,B001QDF5VE,"I am in good shape and exercise regularly. I love to do exercise videos so I have quite the large collection. Compared to others, this is not at the top of my list of workouts.  There are a few reasons why I didn't really care for this workout.  First, I felt that is more suited for a step aerobic workout, although Jari does not use the step (but other people in the class do).  Alot of the moves, were basically step exercises and I felt that they went on for too long (got bored).  Although Jari would increase the intensity, ie jumping to add a little more intensity, after doing this for about two minutes, it got old.  Second I felt like the exercises themselves weren't very structured.  I like to feel like I'm actually toning my body, but here I felt like the constant jumping, running in place etc, did nothing to actually tone.  Although she does use weights, again, the exercises themselves are very ordinary (ie bicep curls).  Just nothing too exciting or to keep my interest.

Second thing I didn't like: The warmup and cool down are very short.  I felt like Jari just jumped right in at high intensity. I can see how someone could pull a muscle and really be sore the next day.  There are alot of squats and I felt that she really needed to do a longer warmup for your legs to get you ready for this.  I guess there is a cool down (as someone pointed out) but, again, so short, I didn't actually even remember doing it.

Third, I felt like Jari is just too skinny and has really no muscle tone.  While doing this workout I'm thinking to myself, this lady is way too skinny to be a fitness instructor.  She needs a little muscle mass.  For instance I love Jillian Michaels workouts.  They are very structured and she doesn't focus on one exercise for more than 20 seconds or so.  Jillian has some muscle mass and tone.  I also love Billy Blanks workouts - his daughter Shelly who does the workouts with him, is also very toned and doesn't look like Skeletor (Jari).

Also, not a big fan of the atmosphere of this workout.  Very dark and everyone seemed to be scrunched together.  I like a nice big lighted room - makes me work harder and feel better.  The jungle outfits were a bit weird, and as another reviewer pointed out, everyone in the video is very ""orange"" looking and nobody seems to be having a good time.  It is very bizarre.

Although I have several workouts I enjoyed better than this, I can see how some people would enjoy it.  It does get your heart rate up, but it is not the kind of workout I was looking for. If you like step aerobics then this would probably be a good workout for you.  I don't see myself putting this in my rotation of workout videos.",1267920000,8,2686,4.330661322645291
3764109,4,B001QDF5VE,"I bought this video because 'Fitness Magazine' rated it the Highest Calorie Burning Exercise video of the last year. I had a great time at it and currently work out at an intermediate level but I still believe Jillian Michaels videos (both 'Boost Your Metabolism' & 'No More Trouble Zones'<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jillian-Michaels-No-More-Trouble-Zones/dp/B001NFNFMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jillian Michaels: No More Trouble Zones</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jillian-Michaels-Banish-Fat-Boost-Metabolism/dp/B001NFNFN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jillian Michaels: Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism</a>) burned way more calories and were certainly much more challenging.

Jari doesn't say much about form or about getting all the way down into moves for maximum burn which I'd like to see. I like that it has a countdown timer for the end of strength moves and also the fast pace. The cardio is a little weak unless you own a step though, which I would guess most people don't own at home.

Overall, it is a fun and challenging workout & I'm glad I bought it for variety but if you're more advanced, I would check out the Jillian Michaels video which I'm addicted to.",1267574400,,1259,6.271676300578035

Also, you can use a step or not and you can increase your weights as your strength increases.

As far as keeping things interesting, Jari is a little witty during the video, but all that plays is a safari-type drum-beat - which gets boring to me - I'd rather have some current pop tunes playing, but overall a fairly good workout.  I did not, however, burn 1,000 calories as it markets . . . my heart monitor showed that I burned in the high 600s before continuing on the the ab portion to burn a bit more . . . and I did not keep it at a lower level . . . I went to the highest level in every exercise . . .

I love all of the other dvd's of Jari's because it's an excellent workout with the pulses and high reps and choice to use heavier weights but this one is very different.  There is no rest between sets.  You do combination exersizes with weights for a couple of minutes and then high intensity cardio for a couple of minutes and alternate this throughout the entire dvd.  The music is motivational with the native sounding drumb beat and three different levels of intensity demonstrated so you can choose your workout intensity.

I actually found out about this video cause I read an article in a magazine about exercise videos and how much calories they burn.  This one burns a whopping 1000 calories for the whole hour workout (2 workouts combined), hence the name (* based on a 140 pound woman).  I highly recommend this video.

Then I actually tried the workout. It's *awesome*!  I'm a serious exerciser and consider myself in decent shape but I had to use pretty light weights, and there is no way I could do this with a step right now! The advanced versions of the exercises really are advanced - there's alot to work up to with one. Still, there are modifications for beginners as well, so there are plenty of options. I really like the format of alternating short 2-3 minute intervals of cardio and strength.  My only complaint is that the stretching segment at the end seemed pretty minimal. Also, there is not much targeted ab work.  Other than that, this is a fantastic workout. You will definitely not be bored!

3764119,5,B001QDF5VE,"The first time I did this dvd I hated it!  I have been working out to Jari Love's dvd's for a couple years now and really loved the one before this one...Ripped and Chiseled.  When I first did this one I felt like I could barely  keep up!  While the other dvd's have a little break between each exercise where you have time to change weights, see what is coming up next, and get in position, this one moves from exercise to exercise very quickly.  It is also more of a cardio workout than one to sculpt and chisel muscle.  I did't get sore at all from doing it, though did have that good ""after glow"" to my some of my muscles.

I usually only have time to do the 30 minute workout and I feel it gives a good overall workout in that amount of time.  It's nice that it is broken down into either of the two workouts or you can do the combined one for an extra intensive work.  It gets my heart rate up quite nicely and once I got over the drastic difference from Jari's past dvd's, I found that I really do like this workout!  With use I'm starting to know what is coming next so the fast pace is not leaving me behind like it did at first.  I still use Ripped and Chiseled on Saturdays when I have an hour to workout, and it is still my favorite, but this dvd definitely has a place in my collection and I feel it's a good one to keep my metabolism up.",1266796800,2,1351,4.003731343283582

i was wrong, this is a great workout, here is what i like about it:
- demanding with high high repetitions
- no wasting time - she gets right to it.
- as weight is changed, she tells you what each model is using for weight so you have an idea of what to use
- there is a countdown clock that tells you when you have 30 seconds for each muscle group.  i found this motivating to keep going.
- reminds me of an Australian ""pump"" class I used to do, high repetitions, no rest between sets, good transitions, motivating bodies to watch, combined workouts are approximately one hour.
- music doesn't overpower the workout
- simple moves but not boring
- jari does great transitions to the more complex moves, gradually easing you into the move so even the uncoordinated can keep up
- her timing is just right on changing repetitions, you are always in time with the others
- low key demeanor
- different ""models"" are varying the workouts so that you can easily enjoy this whether you are novice or advanced

Equipment needed:
- 3 sets of weights, I personally found 2 lbs, 5 lbs and 8 lbs to be right
- optional step to add intensity",1266624000,,1336,4.332

I love the little clock on the screen that lets you know you only have 30 more seconds of the cardio interval so that you can push yourself and not quit.

3764125,5,B001QDF5VE,"Wow, I have grown to LOVE this DVD (no pun intended, haha). I always hesitate to buy fitness DVDs because after losing 90 pounds with diet and LOTS of exercise, many of them just don't push me hard enough. Well, I can proudly say that Get Extremely Ripped has exceeded my expectations! Although there is a mix of beginner, intermediate and advanced moves, I really wouldn't recommend this DVD to those who are just starting out and new to exercise. For those who like to push themselves however, buy this now!

As other reviews have mentioned, it's 60+ minutes of circuit training, with intervals that include about 3 minutes of cardio followed by about 1 minute of strength training (primarily using dumbbells). I love to work up a big sweat with cardio, but hate strength training, so I found this DVD quite motivational. It forces me to work on resistance moves but still has more than enough cardio to keep my heart rate up and keep me sweating the whole time! And yes it's well over 60 minutes if you do the full session, BUT it does go by pretty fast, so please don't let the time discourage you. You can also opt to split the workout into smaller sessions (great feature if you're pressed for time), but once you feel your body getting stronger, you'll want to just finish the whole thing.

I've found this workout to be a great alternative on days I don't feel like going to the gym for running/incline training or when I get bored with lifting free weights. It truly is a total body workout!

And I love Jari's guidance- she's positive, provides good instruction and keeps me motivated throughout the whole session. I've done a lot of Tae Bo, Jillian Michaels and Tony Horton DVDs, but Jari's down-to-earth personality has quickly made her one of my all-time favorites!

In fact, I love this DVD so much that I've gone ahead and ordered an aerobic step so I can challenge myself even more and start doing the alternative step moves that are done by some of her ""helpers"" in the back.

3764131,4,B001QDF5VE,"This is hands-down one of the best workout videos I own.  It blasts calories and gives the a great cardiovascular workout, while also toning and sculpting the muscles.  I workout six days a week and do everything from Insanity to P90X to Billy Blanks, but I'll tell you this whooped my rear the first time I did it.  I always do the complete workout, which runs a little over an hour.  I'm 5'2"" and 115 lbs., and according to my heart rate monitor, I burn just under 800 calories a pop.  Now, I do use risers and I (in most cases) use the same weights as Laurie, but still it's really hard for me to find a workout that torches calories that fast.
I won't go through the complete breakdown of the moves, as that's already been done by several reviewers, but I will re-assert that you alternate b/t cardio and strength training chapters.  Jari moves VERY quickly b/t the two...almost too quickly.  Some of her earlier videos left too much time b/t chapter changes, however I hustle to get back into position and to start in correct form.  My advice to newbies to the video, have your weights ready and on-hand.  My only other criticism of the video is that, if you're familiar at all with Jari's earlier work, you're gonna recognize many of these moves.  I really like the group of exercises she's put together, but I also feel like I can pull out three of her older videos and repeat the exact same workout.  I would like to have seen a few more fresh moves and less repeat.  But at the end of the day, it's still an outstanding lower and upper body workout with great cardio moves that really get your heart rate up.  As a final aside, I actually like that you see more of Jari's personality here and in Get Extremely Ripped.  I appreciate the energy she gives, and truly enjoy seeing her more informal side.  Great workout head to toe, and leaves me smiling!",1264723200,14,1860,4.413489736070381
3764132,3,B001QDF5VE,"Ok, I'll give you some background on my experience with Jari.  I have been using ""Slim and Lean,"" ""Ripped to the Core,"" ""Ripped and Chiseled,"" and ""Ripped 1000,""  alternately for about 7 months, so I am no stranger to her or her exercises.  This video definetely breaks away from the previous ones I mentioned.  The usual set is gone and instead of her and 3 other Rippers, you will see 5 other people.  The only one I had seen before was Laurie, who, in my opinion should have been in the front due to her extensive experience with Jari and her perfect form.  Having 6 exercisers total looked a little cluttered to me and difficult to see the exercises, which move much faster than previous DVDs.  Also, I am sorry, but the clothing bothered me.  It looked as if everyone was preparing for a night at the club instead of trying to break a sweat and get in good health.  I so loved the atmosphere of the older Ripped workouts because it was down to business, no nonsense, no frills, just you your weight and getting some results.  This video felt like more of a social event with Jari chatting during the workout when she should have been cueing, counting, and give tips on form and modifications.  There are some modifications provided throughout, but what I don't understand is why for the sake of simplicity she doesn't just have the same one person demonstrating all the beginner modifications the entire time so that you always know where to look if you need to take it down a notch.

That said, the workout is pretty good.  Don't be fooled, though... if you were looking for some serious strength traning, look elsewhere because I feel that more than anything this was a cardio workout.  I was out of breathe and sweating like crazy which is not something you should see with a strength training workout.  I know her goal is to keep the heart rate up with compound movements and no breaks, but this is borderline ridiculous.  You almost have to hit pause just to grab a different set of dumbbells at some points and there is no stretching in between, which I don't think is a good thing.  And don't even bother busting out your heavier dumbbells.  I wasn't able to use anything higher than 5s in this video because the movements are so fast and the reps are even higher than other videos.  I am advanced... just to give you an idea for comparison... in other videos of hers I am able to use 8s on biceps, and 5s on shoulders, but in these I had to go down to 5s and 3s respectively.  Some of the motions are a little awkward too and difficult to work the targeted muscle because of that. Like when she has you throwing back your leg and your arms to work the triceps... it might have been better at a slower pace, but during the single counts I didn't have time to get my arms far back enough to feel the burn.

The abs at the end are a little better than some of the other DVDs, but still not amazing.  Jari is just not known for very good ABs workouts.  The stretch, though she mentions trying to make it more complete, really isn't... you hold the stretches longer, but you do less of them.  I continued stretching on my own.  No stretching was given to the outer hips, hip flexors, quads, calves or biceps.

The workout really is a good one, but I guess it's just not what I was expecting.  I believe I will probably remain more loyal to her older Ripped workouts.  Good luck to you.  Hope this helps.",1264550400,24,3411,4.3869426751592355

There is nothing complicated to the 3-min cardio segments and she shows 3 different levels, one minute each testing your endurance. In addition, different exercisers show alternate options making this DVD very versatile. The music is tribal and I found it motivating.

I'm just not coordinated for dancy type stuff.  This DVD has a bunch of that.  I felt lost a lot during the cardio parts-and started to get bored.  They have 3 different levels to work at--beginner, regular, and advanced.  That's helpful.  Due to knee problems, I don't do plyo exercises so it was nice that there were alternatives offered.

Now-I know other reviewers complained about the outfits. I have to say, the jungle print didn't bother me that much.  I was happy that the girls working out with Jari weren't dressed in outfits that were overly revealing (as some exercise DVDs are-and I hate that!).  The woman to the left of Jari appears to be wearing some sort of leathery looking exercise pants??? (not that this makes the DVD bad-it's just sort of humorous) The dark background wasn't really a distraction for me-and I was sort of pleased that the set was different from her other DVDs-for variety.

People who love weight training and dancy sort of workouts might like this DVD.  If you have two left feet, as I do--don't bother with this.

This workout is the most vigorous I have tried in the series but usually does not leave me sore the next day unless I really jack up the weights.

But i wanted a really effective workout that would live up to what I have been doing but give me something different. ER 1000 delivered in a big way! The workout is an hour which is wonderful. I love not having to put in 2 DVD's I could just press play complete workout and i got in over 60 minutes of good cardio and strength training. I am really really impressed with it and pleased. I like Jari and her team they seem like real people and Jari's manner of instructing is refreshing and encouraging without being fake and insincere. They didn't make it seem like a peace of cake, they offered varieties for all fitness levels. I think anyone can benefit from this dvd, all fitness levels and i cant imagine anyone not seeing results. Jari, you have a new fan!",1262908800,4,956,4.229508196721311

I love it, and I now have another love which is Jari's newest Extremely Ripped: 1000.  I consider myself in awesome shape, but I could not finish this video the first time.  I tried again the second day, determined to finish.  I did and was amazed at how refreshed I felt afterwards!  Definitely worth buying.",1262736000,8,462,4.123595505617978

Well, the workouts are tough and challenging but I love this video! There are various levels so anyone can use it. And, rather than brow beating you, Jari provides a lot of support and encouragement. She really wants you to succeed and move to the next level. I love how energized I feel after a workout. It has been a great way to incorporate circuit training into my workout routine. The music is perfect as it provides a steady beat.",1262649600,5,568,4.419047619047619

It's nice that it can be broken into two 20-minute work outs for days when time is an issue. The dynamic sequences are great since you work out multiple muscle groups as once. I was wiped out after finishing this, which is a good thing in my opinion. As usual, great work from Jari Love.",1262217600,,404,4.0625

She also does not take the time to stretch except for at the beginning and the end, which in my opinion is the way it should be.

Neither of the videos have the long breaks between sets like her first 5 do. Also, both videos are using compound exercises the whole time, which is great for burning more calories. Get Ripped 1000 is a good work out, but isn't the best for actual lifting because the lifting segments are only 1 minute. Jari gives several options for the cardio segments if you are more of a beginner or intermediate exerciser. For an advanced workout, you can stay in zone 3 throughout all of the cardio.",1262131200,,612,4.5225225225225225
3764148,3,B001QDF5VE,"I was excited to see a workout that was like Get Ripped 1000, a mixture of cardio and weights.  From an exercise perspective, I enjoyed this DVD.  The routine is different - more movement, increased heartrate, and varying steps.

But there are so many distractions, many which can also be found in Get Extremely Ripped.
- Jari is much more chatty in these DVDs than in all of her other DVDs.  I prefer a more focused instructor, especially since after watching it a few times, her comments are a bit annoying.
- Jari doesn't do all of the exercises as in her other DVDs.  I prefer instructors to sweat along with me, not visit the people in the back.
- She's upped the number of people in the video from her standard 3.  They are all very fit (which is good), but a strange shade of orange.
- Jari loses count during the moves.  It makes her appear very unfocused and disinterested.
- The music and outfits are very gimmicky.  Kind of 80s.

I only gave it 3 stars because of the distractions.  I liked the exercises and will continue to use the DVD.  However, this and Get Extremely Ripped just don't have the same professional feel as Jari's previous DVDs.",1261526400,20,1157,4.436018957345971
3764149,2,B001QDF5VE,"I own most of Jari Love's DVD's, and I have to say that I was a bit disappointed in this DVD. Some of the cardio was just too long and boring. She should have been more creative.  Sometimes she would begin an exercise and the camera was not where it should have been to show me how to perform the exercise. Also, I do not like the set being so dark.  However, the redeeming factor is that it was not that expensive, so for the money it was just okay.",1260576000,6,450,3.988888888888889

This workout is amazing, you sweat and get a super workout but I didn't feel my muscles were as fatigued after this one...I was but my muscles weren't. Her cardio bursts were much longer in this video as well.  I found it too ""jumpy"" for me, but it is effective. I highly recommend any Jari workout, but if you've never done one before, I wouldn't start with this - especially if you're just getting started in a workout routine.",1260316800,12,597,4.477064220183486

(actually 40 if you do the abs and the cool down) workouts are good, especially the first 30 min. segment.  I don't have much space for my workouts nor do I have a full hour at times.  Jari moves along more quickly and is less formal than in her other DVDs.  The conversation with Rippers gets a little old; however, the music is better than on other non-Jari DVDs that I use. On the down side, the second 30 min. segment has a couple of combos that don't seem to be in time with the music and are a bit akward.  Maybe I need more practice.  Overall, I feel that I get a good workout in a lesser period of time and don't get bored.",1260057600,,742,4.01360544217687

That workout, like many have said before, had some goofy dialogue from Jeri, a dark set, annoying music, and it did not enough cardio for my tastes.  Boy am happy I did buy ER 1000! The new workout has a substantial amount of cardio and the beat never stops...you are in for a wonderfully hard workout for a full hour. When it gets tough we say ""YES!"", right?. ER1000 has become my new favorite(before was Ripped 1000-but alas! now that i did this workout the old one appears to have too much stretching between segments and my heartrate dropped too much). This workout WILL burn many many calories, the music is fun, the hour goes by quickly, and you can be a beginner or advanced and use the workout.  Well worth it.",1259971200,3,818,4.476510067114094

3764154,3,B001QDF5VE,this could could be a really good workout if you can get past a couple of things. one are the awful outfits displayed on a dark set. kind of startling. and second is the feeling that the exercisers don't want to be there which is clear in the tape. they are lazy and show a disintrest. but if you can get past that this could be a good workout.,1258675200,,344,4.0
3764155,5,B001QDF5VE,"This latest workout from Jari is FANTASTIC! This workout was designed for the beginner through to the extremely advanced. Jari explains during the workout that beginners who follow Ellie (girl in front on left side of screen) will burn as many calories as the more advanced people that follow the more extreme workout. I am ashamed to say that my workout regime has not been a priority in my life and I have allowed myself to slip back into the beginner category. My current goal is to make it through to and complete an entire advanced workout- without throwing up! I followed Ellie daily for about 2 full weeks and began to mix it up with the more advanced workout for the last 10 days and I have been able to shed 22 lbs in that amount of time. I also changed my diet which helped with the weight loss.

If you are looking to lose weight and finally get your body into shape in a short amount of time, don't look any further- THIS IS THE ONE! If you are already in shape and workout regularly, this is workout is for you too, if you're up to the challenge! I wouldn't hesitate recommending this to anyone. I would scream it from a mountain top if I could.",1258588800,5,1158,4.3119266055045875
3764156,5,B001QDF5VE,"This is an excellent adjunct to the get ripped 1000 workout. It's set up in the opposite manner in that this time the cardio is longer intervals of 3 minutes, and muscle training circuits are 1-2 minutes. It looks easy to watch but 3 minutes of plyometrics in the advanced category is killer! There is always someone on the screen demonstrating the various beginner, intermediate and advanced moves so you can choose what is most challenging based on your fitness level. The option of choosing only cardio, weights, or abds alone is also available if one is short on time. The abdominal/ push-up workout in the end could have been longer and more intense but overall an excellent workout.

Jari shines through in this workout allowing the exerciser to see her great personality!",1257897600,2,275,5.0
3764159,5,B001QDF5VE,I love this workout.  I own about 6 of Jari's videos and this is one of my favorites.  Along with Get Extremely Ripped this Get Extremely Ripped 1000 offers the option to play workout 1 and/or 2 plus you can do just the cardio or just the weights and an added option of pushups and abs only.  So I think Jari is listening to feedback from her customers and trying to make for a better product.  The cardio portions are not too complicated and enough to get your heart rate up and the weight segments are challenging.  I do think people will be confused and think that the workouts 1 and 2 are 30 mins each but they do total about 40 mins when you factor in the pushups and abs and stretch.  I like my workouts to be that length though so it didn't bother me but it may bother some.  I am really happy adding this to my rotation.,1257811200,2,828,4.105590062111801
3764160,4,B001QDF5VE,"This dvd is the most difficult one to date, in my opinion. I have previously been able to do all the reps in a segment (even if the last ones were really tough) on the other dvds. This one kicked my butt. I had to use lighter weights for the last reps on some of the segments; there is MUCH more cardio work here.

I didn't rate this a 5 because I dislike the change in the tenor of these last 2 dvds. The viewer is very removed. Perhaps it's the new gym setting? She is more engaged with the people on the set and not as encouraging to the home exerciser. The first few Ripped dvds had a wonderful quality. Jari made you feel like she was right there cheering you on. In any case, I am thankful to Jari and her team for all of the Ripped workouts. I don't look forward to this one like I do the others, but it's good to have one with more emphasis on cardio training.",1257724800,,868,3.9885057471264367

In addition, you can select Cardio only or weights only.  I also really like the 30 sec countdown at the end of each workout segment-which goes a long way into keeping me motivated to finish. I did the entire hour the first time through and felt great afterwards. The best of Jari Love by far, and way better than Jillian Michaels.",1257120000,3,485,4.426966292134831

During one week I did each half hour workout on different days.  I worked up a good sweat and felt really solid after I was done.  Today, I did the entire workout at once....and only after a few hours I am starting to feel sore.  This kicked my butt, but it was so good!

My favorite will always be the original Ripped 1000, but this one is really worth adding to your collection!",1254960000,20,413,4.48
3764167,5,B001QDF5VE,"I have all six of Jari's previous workouts, so wasn't sure how different this one would be, but I'm really glad I got it.  The focus of this workout is interval training, where Jari has you alternate between three minutes of cardio, followed by 1-2 minutes of strength training.

The cardio interval format is complemented by compound moves with the strength-training exercises; it's so nice to have both combined in one workout since they are the two best ways to burn fat.  As far as intensity goes, it seems like Jari's hardest workout so far.  If you liked Get Ripped 1000 and Get Extremely Ripped, you'll like this one.  It has similar exercises as those two previous videos, but enough new moves to make it worthwhile. I'd describe it as a combo of those two previous workouts: it has the cardio intervals of GR1000, combined with more of the compound moves from GER. The other thing that makes this one really tough is that there are no rests between each exercise; the workout moves from cardio right into strength training each time, so your heart rate stays elevated throughout the workout.

To do this workout, you will need various weights of dumbbells.  A step is optional, but it will really make the workout more intense if you have one.

As another reviewer mentioned, a really nice bonus of this workout is that you can do one long workout (about 75 minutes total, including the abs and stretch), the two thirty-minute workouts, just the cardio intervals, just the weight-training sections, or just push-ups and abs.  It's nice to have the options broken down so much.

The abs section consists of planks, side planks, and crunches.

Workout one consists of the following exercises:
--Warm up
--Alternating Knees
--Side Squats w/ Biceps curl
--L-Hops
--Regular/Prone rows
--Squat with Arnold Press
--Monkey Jumps
--Triceps Extension with Leg Abduction
--Jacks
--Anterior Raise with Knee Lift
--Basic Step
--Chest Press and Flyes
--Cooldown and stretch

Workout two consists of the following exercises:
--Warm up
--Charleston Lunges
--Dead Lift and Biceps
--Basic Step
--Pendulum Lunge
--Wide Squat with Unilateral Raises
--Toe Touches
--Side Squat/Lunge with Triceps Extension (right)
--Lunge Hops
--Side Squat/Lunge with Triceps Extension (left)
--Speed Skater
--Alternating Lunge with Lateral Raises
--Push-ups and Abs
--Cooldown and stretch

Jari's most recent workout before this one (Get Extremely Ripped) met with some negative feedback since the set on that video was really dark and it was hard to see some of the movements.  Jari and her crew have rectified some of those grievances on this newer one:  the set is a bit brighter (although it's still pretty dark, so you might not like this one if GER's darkness bothered you) and it's easier to see what all of the exercisers are doing. Jari's form is also better in this one, and she doesn't make any negative comments about the background exercisers. (Those aspects of GER didn't bother me, but I know that they bothered some people.) The ""tribal feel"" to the music and clothing are also nice; I really liked the music, and there were only a few songs that I had heard before on other workouts.

Another nice feature that was also on Get Extremely Ripped is that each segment ends with a timer that counts down the last thirty seconds of that segment.  I also liked how Jari has more background exercisers working out at different levels:  she has a modifier for beginners, plus exercisers for more intermediate and advanced exercisers, too. If you check out Jari's website, you can also purchase a PDF file that gives various rotations using all seven of her DVD's.

Overall, this is a nice addition to my rather large video collection.  I really like Jari's down-to-earth, motivational style, and I can tell that I will be doing this workout a lot!

UPDATE ON 10/9/09:  I did Get Extremely Ripped (the video right before this one) this morning, and the set is definitely lighter and brighter on this newer workout.  It's the same set that they are on, but it's much easier to see what the exercisers are doing on this newer workout.  So if the darkness on GER bothered you, it shouldn't as much on this one.",1254873600,103,4187,4.88135593220339

3764172,3,B001QDF5VE,"This video is a good workout if you are up for the challenge. Jari moves quickly from segment to segment to keep things interesting but I found the actual segments themselves pretty mindless. I also thought that the repetitions were so fast that I didn't think I was doing a full-range of motion exercise. This burns calories but I wonder how much it does for actual strength. It also makes it hard to use anything but light weights.
The styling of the video is industrial and not very attractive,. The music is as annoying as ever but Jari's chatter seems to be a bit more than usual.

3764176,4,B001QDF5VE,"This dvd is one of the most challenging of Jari's collection. (I have tried all but the earliest one.) It involves more consistent movement and compound exercises. It's a nice change of pace- if you like a quicker pace. This will elevate your heart rate more than the other dvds.
I didn't give it 5 stars because I think she is less engaged with the viewer in this dvd- more focused on giving her fellow work out buddies a hard time. It's fine the first time you watch it, but if you are like me and use these frequently, the chatting about babysitting, rowdy teenagers, and who sweats more gets wearisome.

3764177,5,B001QDF5VE,"Thanks to Jari Love, I switched from being a couch-potato exercise-hater to an exercise lover. I don't like to bounce around doing dancy cardio, and I can't run (joints). Thank goodness I found the Ripped workouts. I've lost a pound a week for 26 weeks and gained a lot of muscle and definition. I'm very particular about exercise DVDs: the music, the pace, the voice, the cueing. I don't like to be ""yelled at"" and I like being encouraged and offered variations on exercises for my joint problems and age (55) and level of ability. Jari's voice is especially nice, and that's important at 5 am, which is when I do my exercises before work. She always smiles, always offers encouragement, and has the students in her videos doing different variations of the same exercise. No exercise lasts too long, but they all last into the BURN phase. If you do not feel the burn, up your weights and improve your form. In Extremely Ripped, Jari does lose her form once in awhile, but you can watch Kirstin, the woman to the right of the screen, for perfect form (the others also have great form). I like that the Ripped workouts are based on experiments that measure calorie use and metabolism. Each one seems to improve on the one before.

That said, in Extremely Ripped, the set and the outfits take some getting used to. I didn't like them at first, but who cares, really? Also, Jari is much more casual and jokes a little too much, but again, after watching it for a couple of weeks, you won't notice, and it helps pass the time.

I particularly like that I can choose from two shorter workouts for rushed mornings, or do the whole thing on a Saturday when I have plenty of time.

Oh, and did I mention that Jari looks fantastic? That helps keep me motivated.

UPDATE: A couple of weeks later and several more viewings, I now love the set, love the outfits, love the chit-chat and joking (it really helps you feel like part of the in-group). Jari was right, I was wrong about the new format for her videos. I can't wait for Extremely Ripped 1000.",1251676800,6,2039,4.487870619946092

Her workouts definitely work, you just have to look at her own body and Laurie's.  They have been transformed over the different videos through the years into a much toned and slim look.

It is very challenging, a bit different than her Extremely Ripped that came out earlier this year. The intervals are 3 minutes long.  Much of the cardio is what I would describe as plyometrics, which is alot of jumping and fast powerful movements that get your heart rate way up there which is more than enough time before you begin the weight lifting.  Jari does give 3 types of levels for each section, so anyone can do the workout. I believe if you follow Ellie, who is to Jari's right, demonstrates level 1 which is for beginners. Jari and Kirsten do level 2 and 3 and the rest in the back do level 3.
So far, I have only done workout #1 which is about 30 minutes long. However, I did see the whole video.  There is a section for abs which consist of planks and crunches.  All the same people are in this DVD as the ""Get Extremely Ripped DVD that came out earlier.  The outfits are cute and the theme is ""tribal"". Interesting music if you like tribal drumbeats but, honestly, I'm in it for the actual workout. I don't care about aesthetics unless its really distracting. In this case, I thought it was very well done and more importantly I felt that I got a really challenging workout. The newer dvd gives you a choice to do interval workout #1 or #2 just like the previous dvd. But, what was different in this dvd was the 2  options to either do weights by itself or just straight-up cardio. I thought that was a clever addition just in case you are not up for the combination of intervals and weights from workout 1 or 2.  I really like it, and I think most people will be very pleased.  In combination of clean eating, this workout would be highly effective in burning a tremendous amount of fat.  If there is one criticism, it would be that the strength training segments could've been little longer.  Overall, a powerful workout.",1251417600,63,2072,4.426315789473684
3764180,4,B001QDF5VE,"This is the second JL DVD I've used, the first was Ripped to the Core. I'm not sure how I feel about this one yet. I do like that it is an intense workout and a nice change of pace from my usual heavy-weights/medium to low rep strength training routine. I've been doing most of the DVD each time ( skipping the floorwork track in favour of my own thing).

Pros: It does keep you moving. I don't mind the focus on squats and lunges, those are very effective leg exercises and she does do a bunch of variations on the theme. As someone else pointed out, you will not get a good workout if you use momentum to cheat your way through the lifting. I have yet to split the workouts in two, to see if I still feel if they give me a good full-body workout. I also liked the techno music on this release.

Cons: Jari's delivery is loopy, to say the least and people have already thoroughly mocked the outfits. The cueing was off in a few places ( not doing the same number of reps on the other side). Maybe its because I've been doing the whole workout but it also felt like too much emphasis on the shoulders, especially since you can't use very heavy weight for the shoulder presses.

Overall, I'm liking this release and will keep it in my rotation as a change of pace. I think I liked Ripped to the Core a bit better though, because you could go heavier. I'm not sure I am such a big fan that I would keep purchasing her DVDs unless she did one that was really different from these two.",1251158400,,1481,4.153310104529616
3764181,5,B001QDF5VE,"Jari has streamlined her branding and also the structure of the Ripped workout in this DVD, and I really like it for gym-like intensity.  You can't beat the price!

I've been doing her workouts usually once a week for a year and a half, and when i did the first Ripped DVD after taking time off from the gym for about a year I barely made it through.  This DVD probably would've been impossible at that time.  For a beginner I'd recommend very light weights with this one.  The video suggests pausing for stretches--I would definitely pause for breaks if my stamina was low like it had been.

I like that she assumes you don't have a step--in the other videos a lot of prone exercises are used laying on a step.  I use the floor, or The Bean--a kind of contoured exercise ball I own--for those other DVDs.  She demonstrates without, and two advanced modifications are shown in the back using the step.  The workout flows well and maintains intensity; I feel like I'm not missing anything by working without a step.

The flow is great for me, the introduction to the segments and stretches after each that are used in some past DVDs are left out, so it's seamless.  There's a 30 second timer as the sets are ending, so you know relief is in sight!  Most of these exercises are standing, compound exercises.  I don't do the squats/lunges, and there are many, at maximum intensity because I have a cranky right knee that appears to be arthritic and sensitive to joint strain.

I like that I can do an intense home workout, I wouldn't expect to actually be ripped though I certainly wouldn't mind that result.  The classes at my gym are at night or during work hours, so this is as close as I can get to a total body workout class.  I don't have to jump, and I have a very particular downstairs neighbor so that's important regarding noise.  Yet, I was sweating so much doing this DVD without jumping!

One huge plus is the DVD is set up so you can do two half hours.  I've actually split up her past Ripped DVDs (except the first, which does not have a menu function that breaks down the sets) on my own due to time limitations.  These are so intense, each half hour would feel like a more complete workout than half of her past DVDs I believe. Doing the whole DVD takes a while, about an hour and ten minutes if you do the bonus abs section. That said, there's such a sweat I got out of this one it feels like a significant cardio-style benefit as if you're truly killing two birds with one stone.

I wish she would do more floor thigh work, I just can't feel it with squats!  She could take a lesson from Gilad in that department, she only does those kind of leg lifts in her first DVD.  I also appreciate rotator cuff exercises to balance out the shoulder work--she only offers them in Slim and Lean.  At least there's an abs portion to this DVD, it's not there in the last, Ripped and Chiseled.  (She may be 0% body fat and able to effortlessly maintain a 6-pack, but not me!  I need to work my abs to counteract all the sitting I do.)

I admit, the industrial set is a little strangely serious, kind of like the old 80s show Basic Training and the army gear!  The shiny outfits are tacky indeed, but I'm glad I'm not subjected to close-ups of Jari's 6-pack unlike the other videos.  (I'm sure this DVD will be on Youtube in 15 years the way Jazzercise clips from the 80s are on there now, for humor's sake, due to the style.)  I carry most of my body fat on my belly, so 6-packs don't motivate me when I have only achieved that look once in my life, when I had mono and wasn't eating.  I'm glad I'm spared!  The chatter is a little weird, too, because she seems to be antagonizing one woman rather than joking.  My favorite instructors right now are Erin O'Brien on Strong Body, Ageless Body (that video's duration is also very user-friendly, about 45 minutes) and the couple on Exhale Pilates Plus--that has a serene set, too, which I like.

Overall, it's fine with me, because Jari offers a gym style workout I can do at home with minimal equipment, and no jumping, and it's not easy to find. I could never work at this level on my own with my free weights!",1250726400,3,4161,4.3264516129032256

Apparently this reviewer has never seen some of the real perky, almost-nauseating cupcakes who cater to female audiences. I find most of Jari's comments useful.

3764185,4,B001QDF5VE,"I have a few of Jari's Ripped videos and I like them all.  This is a hard workout that will make you sweat (if you are a sweater unlike Jari apparently) within the first 5-10 minutes.  This is probably the most unprofessional-seeming video of the ones I have done from this series though.  A few of the exercisers in the video have really bad form in several different tracks that I find to be really inappropriate to people who may not be advanced and still trying to learn.  It seems like they are tired and getting a little lazy in their movements.  If you are more advanced, then it probably won't affect you since none of the moves are novel here - it's all stuff we've done before but this is to the extreme on the reps, per Jari's usual style.  I enjoy this workout and will keep it in the rotation for a while until I find something else to keep me motivated and it (along with the others I own from this series) is giving me results I haven't gotten in the past 2 1/2 years of weight training.  I do the entire hour or so workout with the step though and not just one segment.  The downside is that Jari is more chatty and a little patronizing in the video so you have to deal with that.  The leather pants are a bit ridiculous too, but I forgive her for that one.  I get that she was going for a silly theme there, but she should stick to the stuff she is best at -- kicking our rears into shape and who cares what they wear or how much they sweat or breathe out loud...",1247875200,,1480,4.107638888888889
3764186,5,B001QDF5VE,"I have Slim & Lean, Ripped to the Core and this AND guess what, I use this the most. I find this workout very efficient and because it's shorter than S&L and RTTC, I have the option of adding a little more cardio at the end. That combination works well for me. If I don't get to add my cardio routine, I don't feel bad at all 'coz 10-15 min. into extremely ripped workout 1, I'm dripping with sweat-meaning this is more of an aero/tone rather than just a muscle toning routine. The warm-up, abs section, cool down and stretch are just right and if Jari's form is not the best in this video, just watch Kirsten [the lady on the right/Jari's left] if you're a beginner and if you're intermediate or advanced, you should execute the moves with proper form 'coz you know that already....

About the negative reviews, dark set, dark outfits, harmless comment to Kirsten, I think it's blown out of proportion. Really, focus on the actual workout and you'll be thankful you have this. Some compound exercises are awkward the first few times BUT with time and practice, you'll be fine..

3764188,4,B001QDF5VE,"Like some other reviewers, I'm new to Jari's workouts, and really enjoyed this one!  After reading some of the previous reviews, I had actually been nervous about ordering this workout since some were negative, but am so glad I did.  In my review, I'd like to address some of the previous review comments that originally had me worried about ordering this DVD.

First of all, some reviewers noted that the dark set and black clothing of Jari and the background exercisers made the moves hard to see.  I did find this to be the case when the camera shot them from the side, but each new exercise begins with a clear front view that was easy to see, so this was not a problem at all for me.  By the time that the camera moved to the side shots, I already had a clear view of the exercise and knew what to do.

Several other reviewers also noted that they didn't like Jari's chatter in this one, but I found it to be just fine.  Yes, she does make one comment about a background exerciser who sweats a lot, but it did not seem to be as mean-spirited as other reviewers made it out to be.  I actually liked that fact that in this workout Jari is more interactive and chatty.  She has a sweet personality.

Another nice feature is that you can do this entire workout with dumbbells; you don't need a barbell, as you do in some of Jari's other workouts.  I also used my step for more of a calorie burn, but Jari and two other exercisers don't use one.

The biggest con is that Jari's form is not as great as it is in some of her previous workouts.  For instance, during the biceps curls segments, she is swinging her body, probably because she is using too much weight.  If you're newer to exercising, watch one of the background exercisers for proper form or be sure to start with other Jari videos to get your form down.  Also, the lone male exerciser was hidden away in the back, which could be a problem for male viewers who want to see another male with proper form.

I really liked this workout.  It was a fun, no-dread-factor workout, and I'm going to incorporate it into a rotation for the next few weeks.  I'll try to post back with my results after doing it on a more regular basis.",1246579200,2,2186,4.290243902439024

Still a little weak on the ab workout, which is at the end of each segment, but at least it is included. As with all of her dvd's, she really pushes you and inspires you to do a great workout.",1246060800,,464,4.076923076923077

Being 47, and having worked out for almost 35 years, I have done video workouts from Jane Fonda until now. Workouts at gyms have not come close to the results people can get from doing this workout. Jari's videos are a favorite workout of mine. These workouts develop long, lean muscles. The toning of your muscles is obvious early in the training process. You can visually see postitive changes in your body quickly. I especially like this video, because it has two, 30 minute sessions if you in a hurry, or one, 1 hour session for a more intense session, plus an 8 minute abs section.

3764194,5,B001QDF5VE,"Just when I thought it couldn't get any harder than Ripped 1000...this DVD came along.  I actually burn more calories in less time because of this gem.  I normally do a 60 minute workout and if I can burn the same amount of calories in 30 minutes, I'm all for it.  My heartrate monitor is proof.  This workout will challenge you and the exercisers in this video are top notch.  As always, Jari and Laurie continue to look ripped and fabulous.  I was glad to see some new faces and the male exerciser did an amazing job presenting even more difficult modifications...for those daring enough to try.

The camera angles and set are superb.  I have every DVD made by Jari Love and I have to say that this one surpasses them all.  The beat that goes along with every move has been well thought out.  I'm uncertain how anyone could give this a bad review.  There is a modification for every track.  Want something for a beginner?  GREAT!  Don't use any weights.  Want something for an extreme challenge?  GREAT!  Follow the exercisers mentioned.  If you're of average endurance, follow Jari.  If you never get off of the couch and out of the Fritos this program will not work for you.  You need to put your body under a certain amount of stress to make it change.

I lost a lot of weight following a low carb way of eating and doing the Ripped workouts.  I continued to go down a couple of sizes, but the scale remained at a certain number.  I am getting leaner even if the scale doesn't say so and personally it doesn't bother me.  I'd rather be healthy and lean than be a certain number.

3764199,4,B001QDF5VE,"This is the second Jari Love workout I have ever tried, and I like this one much better than the first one I did (Get Ripped 1000).  Overall, this workout is probably more accessible to the general public than her previous ones. It is split into two workouts--each 30 minutes long, but you can do both if you want to (I did both plus the bonus 8-minute ab routine).  The first workout I would have to say is more cardio-intense than the second workout, so if you're looking for strength plus cardio and are short on time, I would suggest doing just the first workout.

The good:

1) Moves are very easy to follow.
2) High reps and low weights are the rule for this workout, which I find very effective.
3) Modifications are shown for different levels (i.e., the back row of people are shown using a step, and sometimes Jari suggests moves for beginners)
4) Fast pace plus combination moves that work lower and upper body keep the heart rate up (especially during the first 30 minute workout)
5) The workout is divided into segments, with a 30-second countdown clock to let you know when you're almost done with a segment (this provided me with some motivation to keep going!)
6) When each segment begins, what poundage of weights everyone is using is shown--this gives me a better gauge of what weights I should/could be using.
7) There is a HUGE afterburn with this workout.

The bad:

1) Jari can get a little annoying; in the first workout I did with her, she seemed about as interesting as a wooden post, but in this one she's a little unfocused---starts asking if one of the ladies behind her got a babysitter, etc.  I was like, huh?  What's with these weird comments?  But if you can ignore those and just focus on the exercises, you'll do fine.
2) Jari seemed to be doing some of the moves halfway.  The people behind her were doing lunges and squats that were much deeper and involved than she was; I had to keep looking to them to see what level at which I should be working.
3) The bonus ab section at the end was just OK.  I have done a lot of Biggest Loser Workouts, and Bob and Jillian get my abs begging for mercy more than this ab section did.
4) The warm-up was lunges, squats, etc. . .I would have liked to have seen some more cardio moves in there to really get my muscles good and warm.  Also, if you choose to only do the second workout, there's no warm-up!  (Unless you do your own!)

The good outweighs the bad here for me.  I was more impressed with this workout than with her first one, simply because it wasn't as boring, faster-paced, and hit every major muscle group (although she works the legs in every segment).  This is a workout I will definitely start adding in to my rotation on days when I do strength training; it's a solid workout that will make you feel like you worked out hard!",1243987200,,2817,4.378119001919385

I have GET Ripped 1000, and this blows it out of the water! It is very good for working up a good sweat. The hair around my neck was drenched and I was absolutely dying. I am a very advanced exerciser, and this was really hard for me! I also have all her other DVD's, and have mastered them and the moves involved. I would highly recommend this before even trying this DVD. I wouldn't even say that this is appropriate for intermediate exercisers. If you want to feel the burn and sweat like crazy, this workout is for you. But, beware, DO NOT do this unless you are able to handle the intensity.

Now, for the downsides. This movie is very poorly cued. Jari does not tell you what is coming up, and so you almost need to memorize the order of the moves to do the workout smoothly. Also, in the first workout, she is very rude to Kristen (the woman on the right). This is not appropriate, but Kristen seems to take it in stride. It is not easy to get the exercise right the first time, because Jari does not explain them at all. This is also way too techno and modern, and a lot different than her previous videos. She also talks way too much, and seems to think she is better than all the people there. She also talks to the people there more than those of us on the other side of the TV.

This workout is faster paced. If you're relying on momentum and have poor form, you will not reap the benefits of this workout. I consider myself advanced, and I could feel it all over.

It was much more cardio than the others.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because i didn't like that there are 2 workouts and the warm up is only on the first workout.  If I wanted to alternate workouts I wouldn't get a warm up with the second workout and I wouldn't get a cool down with the first work out.  I also like that there are 2 different 30 minute workouts.  Sometimes an hour workout is too long when I am busy.",1243036800,,583,3.923076923076923
3764207,5,B001QDF5VE,"Jari has done it again, only this time she's done it even better than ever. I am an experienced exerciser and have all the other Ripped DVDs, but I still found Extremely Ripped to be a challenge. I loved the high intensity of all the compound moves and was sweating almost immediately. This DVD is a different format than her previous ones, and I found the new style to be much more fast paced and high energy, keeping my heart rate and spirits high through the whole thing. I like the addition of the countdown clock (that prompts me to give that final push, because I know it is almost over) and the option to do just a 30 minute workout for days when time is tight. Now I never have an excuse not to ""Get Ripped"".",1243036800,,716,4.233576642335766
3764208,5,B001QDF5VE,"This dvd kicks my butt! I work out minimum 6 times a week, including running about 30-35 miles a week. My endurance is very good but I'm lacking in the strength department. This is the toughest Jari dvd, in my humble opinion. I was sore almost immediately after finishing. High reps, low weights- it's a great complement to all the cardio I do. I think beginners would have a hard time with it. I did the entire hour right off the bat and I was drenched! Jari is way more chatty in this dvd...I am not a big fan of a lot of talking but otherwise, this is quite the workout!",1242604800,2,573,4.171171171171171
3764209,2,B001QDF5VE,"I have a number of workout DVDs and am disappointed in this one by Jari Love:

Pro's: 1- Jari is very engaging and upbeat. She interacts well with her colleagues which makes you feel as if you're in the gym with her.

2- The '8 minute' ab work at the end is a very good and thorough workout.

Cons: 1- Video contrasting is poor. The background walls are grayish and the models are wearing dark clothing which makes seeing some movements difficult.

2- There are 5 models aside from Jari. Why they all face the camera is a mystery to me. They should have had some of them face 90 degrees to the camera so that you could see the exercise from the side. Occasionally Jari faces sideways but much too rarely.

3- Once in a while Jari provides modifications to the exercise. She certainly does not do this often enough. And incredibly she gives these few modifications as the exercise is finishing!, not at the beginning.

4- The 'warm-up' routine is more like an actual workout, e.g lunges, biceps curls etc. Certainly not a usual warm-up routine.

5. The actual exercises are rarely explained as to how to accurately do them.

Overall this DVD is not suitable for beginners who have little background in understanding technique.

There are many other programs that will provide you with greater satisfaction for your time, money and fitness.

Stay healthy!",1242604800,5,1353,4.670886075949367
3764210,3,B001QDF5VE,"I have all the JL workouts and have enjoyed all.  While this workout is somewhat challenging, Jari seems to have sacrificed form for speed.  When watching her exercise, her lunges are shallow, her arms are flailing, and she does not provide any form tips except in the back track.  Additionally, in the first set, the lunge track is off--there are no pulses for the left leg.  She is correct that she cannot count. One thing I have enjoyed in her prior workouts is the lack of ""cheerleadiness""; in this she is Chatty Cathy and the gab is extraneous and annoying.  The set appears cluttered, and the clothing is uninspired.  I can see that this DVD will not hold my interest for long.  If you want a better weight work out I suggest the Chiseled & Lean DVD.",1242432000,5,756,4.474452554744525
3764211,5,B001QDF5VE,"The Ripped program is a perfect fit for me, it offers me the chance to work out with compound exercises, cardio and interval training in a group setting without the spandex and leotard image that drives myself and most other men right out the back of the class.

First of all the workout is very involved and strenuous giving for a greater challenge to new and advanced ""Rippers"". Each track offers a wide range of movements and lots of reps so boredom will never be a problem with this program. The fact that you can split the workout in half or do the entire hour is fabulous! That part really appeals to me, sometimes I just can't devote a whole hour to a workout and this way I can do a full program in a smaller amount of time.

The participants definitely exhibit the exercises well and all the different ways they can be done. I think this video offers a great experience for experienced participants to go to a new level as well as for new people to experience a great workout at their own pace. The cinematography is well done, the changes of angle and differences in perspective allow the audience to get a good idea of proper form in the movements and give the video a professional quality that many fitness videos lack entirely. All of the staging elements are well coordinated; the costumes and sets are well matched to the music to give this Ripped video a decidedly industrial feel which works like a charm to get you into the right mental zone.

The atmosphere of this video definitely translates through the screen and helps create the impression of being in a gym without leaving the comfort of home. I believe this video will help bridge the gap for people who are looking for the ""group"" experience in a home fitness video. For busy people who just can't fit a trip to the gym into their schedule and experienced participants looking for something new to challenge themselves, Extremely Ripped is just the ticket!",1242172800,,1933,4.564841498559078
3764212,4,B001QDF5VE,"I just finished Workout I and the 8 minute abs section on Extremely Ripped. Yes, I did sweat and yes, I did get a good workout...but I do think Jari's other videos are more challenging in terms of the weight training component. I have been doing the Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred video so perhaps I am in better shape to do Extremely Ripped because it is similar to 30 Day Shred in that it employs compound moves with weights. That being said, this is a great video if you're short on time or just don't feel like committing an entire hour to exercise. If you want a similar video featuring kick butt, <30 minute workouts...buy 30 Day Shred. It is harder than it looks and your fitness level will increase dramatically!",1242086400,,720,4.462121212121212

8335373,5,B001QDF5VE,"I have worked out to Jari's DVDs for years and also do a lot of Cathe Friedrich's workouts. This one is a calorie killer! I wear my heartrate monitor every time I do it and burn between 700-800 calories each time (I am 44 years old, 145lbs and 5'7"" and female). Even when I am feeling lazy and slack off some, I still burn a ton. Yes, it is long but you knew that when you bought it, right? Some reviewers commented that it is boring and the time just drags on - I couldn't disagree more! For me, the variety of the segments makes the time fly by. You also have the option of breaking it into two 45 minute workouts if you are short on time or just don't want to work out for 75 minutes. Totally your call! Yes, towards the end I very much want it to be over, but am so happy and proud that I stuck it out and finished it.

I love the fact that this workout combines strength and cardio and keeps the heartrate up with dynamic movements. There are a lot, lot, lot of lunges, a good number of squats, and some high impact cardio (tuck jumps, jump squats, high knees, etc.) so if you have knee issues, you may want to skip this one or you will be modifying quite a bit.

Overall, this is my go-to workout for when I want to torch some calories and feel very accomplished for a job well done. I typically do this one 1x per week and do 45 to 60 minutes of either cardio or heavy weights the other 5 days that I work out. I have been doing this rotation for about a month and have experienced some great fat loss.
