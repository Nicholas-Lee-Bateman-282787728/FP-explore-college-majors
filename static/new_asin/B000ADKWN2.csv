2385619,4,B000ADKWN2,"Any real anime fan has at least heard one thing about Clamp. Their unique and catchy storylines, beautiful artwork, and unforgetable characters. I don't love everything by Clamp, however,a few series by them I absolutly adore ( Wish, X/1999, Chobits), while some that really weren't for me (Magic Knight Rayeartth, Card captor Sakura) However, I bought this boxed set, and was pleasently surprised by this series.

I won't get into the plot because its already stated, but I will just say that this is now one of my favorite things by Clamp because of :

1. Icchan (Hee hee! ^_^ Gotta love his ""penalties"")
2. Positive message
3. Amazing fighting scenes with the angels
4. Wonderful characters

And I will just warn you, episode 25 will probably have you bawling. [hahahaa, i was bawling anyway. xD]",1135296000,2,799,4.860294117647059
2385620,5,B000ADKWN2,"Hey it isn't often when a guy reviews such a female-centric anime, but I really enjoyed the whole series.  This dvd is a great add to anyone with some kids who like the battle style animes that are still not overly violent or dumbed down.  The main character Misaki-chi is a positive influence to everyone as she never gives up no matter what odds she is up against.  The ""Wonder Rookie"" as they call her throughout the show as she shows amazing talent at Angelic Layer even though she has just started playing.  I didn't go too deep into the plot or characters only because there is another wonderful review already up here, but I just wanted to let people know how much I enjoyed this series.  Yes even a 26 year old man found something great in this story.  CLAMP has done it again, with another great series (Magic Knight Rayearth, Chobits, Card Captor Sakura, & more.)

2385621,5,B000ADKWN2,"Wow, I can't believe that this is actually becoming a complete collection! I bought this whole series one dvd at a time, so I spent A LOT more money on it. A smart person like you would buy this dvd right NOW! You know you want to..

Angelic layer is about a middle school girl named Misaki Suzuhara (misaki-chi) who just moved to tokyo from a small town. Imedietly after her arrival she sees two ""people"" fighting on a screen. There is a person dressed in white and green who is small, facing a big stronger looking opponent. Misaki, watching intently, suddenly thinks that the little person would lose to the big person. She's small as well. Misaki asks two little kids watching the fight ""what's going on?"" The answer was ""ANGELIC LAYER!"" Angelic layer is actually the game where you make your own ""angel"" or your very own doll. The thing is that this ""doll"" can be customized to fit your liking. It can be fast or strong, big or little, red hair, blond hair, you get my point. These ""dolls"" or angels battle each other and it's a very popular sport. The owner or ""deus"" controls the angel with a head set and whatever the deus thinks the angel does. Misaki makes two new friends at school and a LOT more from playing angelic layer including a famous popstar singer, Ringo, and Ojiro who owns the magical angel Wizard!

There is also a weird person named Icchan who meets Misaki at the subway station. Icchan, the MAKER of angelic layer, offers to teacher her how to play. She fights her way up to the top 4 of the regional championship game and if she wins, goes on to the nationals! Misaki moved to tokyo in the first place to see her mom again whom she hasn't seen in years. Will she find her mother? Does angelic layer have any connection to her? Who exactly is Icchan? Ojiro? It's a REALLY great series by clamp (the four wonderful ladies who changed lives everywhere with their fabulous manga turned anime)

* the manga is somewhat different from the anime because the graphics aren't as good, but it's more detailed storywise. There is also another fight with mao's sister (one of misaki's previous opponents) that isn't in the anime.",1126569600,33,2144,4.520618556701031

2385633,5,B000ADKWN2,"Angelic Layer is about a middle school Japanese girl that moves to Tokyo and discovers Angelic Layer. Angelic Layer is amazing. I wish the technology were available to create this game. You create your own doll and give it strengths. You create your own outfit for it and then you can take it to the layer tables at an Angelic Layer shop and on the layer you can move the doll with your thoughts. The idea is to battle other players dolls and hopefully you'll win! There's tournaments you can enter into to try to win the championship title. The morale of the anime I think is never give up on yourself or your hopes and dreams! For parents out there that are worried about content, this anime is very moral. I really can't think of one thing that would give a parent a second thought on getting this anime for their child. Also, very handy if your child is learning Japanese.  :)  Of course, there's the English version as well with subtitles.",1284768000,,944,4.4508670520231215
2385634,5,B000ADKWN2,"I've seen this anime before and really enjoyed this story, the characters and everything. The only thing is that an edge of my box was slightly crushed, minor and it won't really big me, just happened to be something I noticed when I unwrapped it. The packaging seemed pretty good. As of the characters, I loved the pairing they did compared to the manga, even if it may seem a bit weird, but I just found it so cute. Angelic Layer is one of those animes anyone should or would enjoy, there's not quite a target audience as main characters are relatable and there are people of all ages in it. It's one of the more innocent ones yet full of action what with the angels fighting. Although, I did kind of wish that I could see more about the character pairings. Otherwise, overall, excellent anime and I definitely recommend it to anyone - but if you're unsure about buying it then just watch a few eps online.

5 stars because I can't do 4.5 stars and because of that vertex.",1282953600,,974,4.3812154696132595
2385635,5,B000ADKWN2,"I'm not a crazy anime fan, but I happened upon my sister watching this show on Netflix so I sat down and watched some of it.  Something about it drew my attention and I ended up watching through the whole two seasons on streaming Netflix.

All in all it's just a really well done piece of clean entertainment, great for relaxing and watching and enjoying and it's just really good.  There's virtually no loose ends to speak of, the show has a complete plot and resolution to every conflict.  Development of the main theme is immediate, in the first episode you are introduced to Angelic Layer and Misaki obtains her angel Hikaru right away.

Full of good humor too.  Well rounded show.

This product comes with fully English voice acting which, in my opinion, was done pretty well (and I think the original Japanese can be switched on too with or w/o subtitles, I only watch it in English).  5 disc set.  Nice box to store it in.",1272067200,,929,4.482142857142857
2385636,5,B000ADKWN2,"Angelic Layer is a fun, heart warming, sweet little series that took me back to my childhood, to a time when the world was not so cruel and harsh.

There are no actual villains in this anime, this will be kind of a spoiler but everyone becomes friends at the end of the series.

Although the plot follows a familiar monster of the week routine, every episode is full of fun moments and nice fighting sequences. Sure, the animation looks a little dated but plot and the fluid action scenes makeup for it.

I must say, I'm impressed with the main four characters in this anime. Their friendship is very nicely developed in the series, you wish you could be a part of it, I did.

Finally, plotwise Angelic Layer may not be too deep but some nice twists and the purpose of Angelic Layer is very well laid in front of the audience. I had my doubts at first but enjoyed the series later on. If you like sweet animes, you'll like this one for sure.",1239753600,2,941,4.299435028248587
2385637,5,B000ADKWN2,"My wife and I just finished watching this Anime and it is pretty impressive.

The quality of the art feels a little dated and the overall production quality is good but not AMAZING.

The story on this is pretty original, and is genuine enough that you can fall into the world these characters live in.

The estranged mother daughter situation is really a situation that seem pretty authentic today.

The finale on this is very satisfying and it will live in a place my wife and I hold very near to our hearts.

I recommend picking this up.

The DVD set doesn't come with anything flashy, but the quality of the packaging and the collectors case is solid.

This is a middle of the road kind of production with a higher than average emotional content.

Its good, and very heart warming if you enjoy that kind of thing. (I'm a big marshmallow at heart so it suites me fine.)

This is more great work from Clamp (Chobits, Magic Knight Rayearth, Tsubasa, and XxxHolic). All good stuff too, especially Chobits.

Pick it up... you'll like this one.",1235865600,2,1041,4.548387096774194
2385638,5,B000ADKWN2,"Let me start by saying I haven't read the Manga so this review is based only on the video.

I purchased this anime because of the lack of selection on the shelves in the stores.  I had expected the series to be a fighting series like Voltron where there really is no story.

Delightfully, this is not the case.  Yes, the series is about fighting more and more difficult opponents (notice that I didn't use the word enemies).  What it stresses, but kinda of preachy, is having fun and doing your best.  It is not abouting trashing your Pvp opponent but to use the battleground as another form of playing.

It is highly enjoyable and entertaining.  What pushes it to 5 stars instead of 4 is that it nicely wraps up a story about a girl finally reuniting with her mother and how Angelic Layer evolved to became to be the centerpiece of this meeting.",1230768000,,846,4.412903225806452
2385639,5,B000ADKWN2,I believe that once in awhile you find a series whither TV or anime that stays with you. Angelic layer is a heart warming look into the dreams and emotions of a 12 yr old girl who truly misses her mom. You will laugh with masaki you will cry with masaki and you will be there right along with her every step of the way.,1228176000,,319,3.923076923076923
2385640,5,B000ADKWN2,"This is a really funny anime series about a girl who has not seen her mother since Kindergarten and has moved to Tokyo to live with her aunt. She sees a White Angel fighting a battle on a big screen at the train station and a stranger in a white lab coat encourages her to get involved in Angelic Layer, a game where robotic dolls fight each other in battle. She takes his advice, with funny, romantic and mysterious results. This is a very entertaining series, particularly if you like comic anime. If you're new to anime, it's a light hearted introduction, and if you've watched a lot, it's a refreshing break from some of the more serious anime out there. I will watch this one again, so definitely worth the money.",1227225600,,718,4.446969696969697
2385641,3,B000ADKWN2,"The Angelic Layer anime is based on a very short manga series by Clamp. The story centers on the adventures of Misaki-chan, a tiny school girl, who learns to play a game called Angelic Layer, where contestants fight using mind control helmets to make their ""angels"" - little robotic dolls, move inside a special arena. The manga series is one of Clamp's better offerings, this anime series is not. My first complaint is that the animation is only second rate, reminding me of anime like Robotech, rather than more modern anime like ""Kamichu"" or ""Lucky Star"". The character models only faintly resemble their manga characters. The animators cannot decide how big or small to make Misaki-chan, in some stories she is the same size as her classmates, while in others she is only slightly smaller, not a good foot or so shorter like in the manga. Because of this, all her angst over being ""tiny"" - her driving force for excelling at Angelic Layer - is lost. Because the manga was so short, the producers of the anime had to spread the story out to make 26 episodes. Characters and angel fights not in the manga are introduced, and, like in a Dragonball Z story, a battle that only took minutes in the manga is often spread across two or three episodes. My biggest complaint is that in adding so much stuff, they changed essential parts of the original story. Instead of being painfully shy, Misaki-chan's mother is disabled and ashamed to meet her daughter because of her disability. The boy-girl relationships end up different than in the manga, too, for no apparent reason that I can see other than it appears that the producers and writers painted themselves into a corner with some of the filler stories. This is not a bad anime, it is just not great, and if you haven't read the manga, you will probably like the anime just fine. It is one of Clamps most ""G"" rated offerings, without the strange ""boy meets robot sexuality"" of Chobits and without all the same sex pairings as in Card Captor Sakura.",1226275200,2,1999,4.649717514124294
2385681,5,B000ADKWN2,"What is this series really about? At first glance it looks like it's about the battle dolls fighting on the layer (a special stage that allows these dolls to be mentally controlled). But these fights actually focus a lot on the players and the bond they form with their angels (dolls). In fact, even though the majority of the episodes have an angelic fight the series is really about making new friends, what it means to be a friend, how to live your life, building confidence in yourself, and most importantly, the reconciliation between a mother and daughter who have not seen each other in seven years. It's all of these character moments that really make this series great. This series should have a very wide range of appeal since it has fights scenes guys will like, romance and other things girls will like, a lot of great character development for mature audiences, a humorous side to avoid getting too serious, and a main character that has an infectious personality - you cannot help but like her and root for her. This series has grown on me so much that I have now seen it four times (and the last two times were just a week apart). But if that's not good enough for you, this series was the winner of the Animation Kobe Award for TV Feature in 2001. Stop reading this and just get it!",1189728000,,1298,4.481012658227848
2385682,5,B000ADKWN2,"Angelic Layer, is a masterpiece.  It follows a similar structure to Pokemon, following Hasuka's rise to the top in the Angelic Layer tournament.  The Angelic Layer is a virtual reality game where two players enter their angel dolls into a ring and using their minds to control the dolls to fight each other.  With her Angel, Hikaru (Japanese for ""light""), she fights to win the tournament.  Her two friends support her, as well as contenders for the title who she defeated along the way.

Angelic Layer, however, adds an excellent twist to the monster-fighting genre.  Misaki and the other characters learned not just to compete, but to also enjoy the game and have fun.  Rather than follow the typical shonen theme that the most powerful character may win, Misaki learns that will and determination leads to success.  This is an extremely empowering series, where the characters learn to overcome their failures and work hard.

Along the way, the backstory on the origin of the game leads to an amazing scientific twist, in which the dolls were intended to be controlled as prosthetics for physically disabled people.  Hasuka's missing mom also makes a compelling twist to the story, appearing only to watch her daughter play and never actually meeting her.

This series has amazing depth that the Pokemon series never reached.  Angelic Layer is exciting, intense, and visually stunning.  Studio ""Bones"" handled the animation, and the fluid, fast-paced fight sequences are amazingly entertaining.  All the angel fighters have special abilities that make the fights more intense.  I also appreciated that there was no gore and bloody to turn people off.  This is a series for everyone.

Although this series isn't the most popular anime in Japan, it should have been.  This is one of the best series I have ever seen.",1188432000,,1817,5.0
2385683,5,B000ADKWN2,"Angelic Layer is a GREAT anime series! It's very nice to look at, great dub cast, and it has a very nice touching story.

Unlike some animes you don't have to worry about children coming in the room and seeing something that they shouldn't. (With only a few bad words here and there.)Nothing that they would hear outside a PG movie.

I think most children would prolly LOVE this series. And it's an anime that their parents prolly would love too!  Overall glad to call myself a fan! ^_^",1181433600,,486,4.438202247191011
2385684,4,B000ADKWN2,"A simple anime for those who need a break from all the giant robots, aliens, blood and ""fanservice"" found in just about every other series.  This is a collection that can be shown to children, and thus it can enjoyed by a family as a whole.  I believe that the fighting sequences could have been done a little better, and it can become a little repitious in this aspect.  Do not be discouraged by this, however.  This is a great anime to watch to just take a breather.  It won't leave you wanting more, but neither will you wishing it had ended sooner.  Great for what it is...simple.",1174953600,2,584,4.361111111111111
2385685,5,B000ADKWN2,"O.K., I'll admit it. I downloaded this title via bit torrent after reading an online review, because I wanted to see something different. I watched it twice, and immediately ordered the box set. This is a real gem.

Angelic layer is the story of Misaki, a small, somewhat shy girl who was raised in the country by her grandparents. Misaki's father died when she Misaki was very young, and her mother (Shu) is away in Tokyo because of her work. At the age of 12, Misaki leaves for Tokyo to live with her aunt (Shoko), hoping for the chance to see her mother.

When Misaki gets off the train at Tokyo, she sees a live feed of a fight between two female opponents. She is quickly enthralled by the beauty of the fighters' movements, and begins to root for the smaller of the two, since she herself is small. The smaller fighter wins, and Misaki is hooked.

After learning from a mysterious stranger (Ichan) that the opponents are actually dolls (Called angels), she goes to purchase one of her own, then walks to her aunt's house, since she spent her train fare.

Misaki gets involved with Angelic Layer, the tournament series in which the angel dolls compete.

The great thing about this series is its continual emphasis on being successful through effort. Size doesn't matter in Angelic Layer, and Misaki proves to be a great competitor. Throughout the series, she is upbeat, cheerful, and quick to encourage others.

Her friends (a very fun group) are very supportive of her, and she makes many more friends through the tournament.

Angelic Layer is episodic and predictable (what will Misaki and her angel do to win?!), and would only garner eye-rolls from the older folks, if it weren't tied to a beautiful back story.

Yes, the series is about fighting, but Misaki, her aunt, her mother, her friends, and even that slightly creepy, mysterious stranger (Ichan) develop throughout the series.

Kids will love the school friends, the ""punishments"" that Ichan dishes out to his subordinate, and the well choreographed fight scenes.

Grownups will like the relationships between Misaki, her mother (Shu)  Ichan, Shuko, and the story of how Angelic Layer began.

This is a title I use to introduce people to anime. It has always been well received, and has made many new fans.

Money well spent.",1163548800,9,2292,4.786802030456853
2385686,5,B000ADKWN2,"Angelic Layer has never been my favorite CLAMP series, and while the manga is ok it will never make my list of favorites. When I saw that Angelic Layer had been made into an anime series, I instantly thought 'pass'. But when I came across The Complete Collection for under $40, I thought 'hey, why not?'

While my taste in anime is usually for an intense series with a ton of depth (and usually lots of violence), Angelic Layer was a refreshing change and now it's one I recommend to everyone. Angelic Layer delivers a main character (Misaki) who you can't help but root for throughout the entire series. And yes, it can be predictable, but you'll never find yourself bored or tired of the story. I won't explain the plot here since others have already done so but I will note that if you are familiar with the manga, the anime is different- in a good way.

The animation is pretty good with vibrant coloring that suits the mood well and the character designs transfer from manga to anime well. The music is pretty good as well with a good 'makes you wanna dance' opening theme and while the first ending song is alright, the second is beautiful and always brings tears to my eyes (I don't even know why). I haven't listened to the dub (I never do), but the Japanese cast was great.

Along with Chobits, Angelic Layer is easily one of the better CLAMP-manga to anime series available. If your looking for a wonderful anime sure to make you laugh, cry, smile, and one that you won't regret buying, look no further then Angelic Layer. While younger audiences will be sure to enjoy this series, I personally think older audiences could take even more away from it. While the fight scenes are done very well and are exciting to watch, it was the background stories of the competitors that really got me. Every single side character is well developed and I bet everyone can find at least one they can identify with.

On a side note: even though the collection is rated 'TV PG' with parental guidence suggested for animated violence, I don't think parents should shy away from introducing their children to this series. There is no fighting between people- only the 'battle doll' Angels, and we are constantly reminded that it is only a game everyone is playing. Plus, important themes such as age/height don't determine a person's greatness are stressed throughout.

The series consists of 26 episodes on 5 discs which come in thin-pack cases held in an attractive box that features Misaki and Hikaru on one side and Hatoko and Suzuka on the other. Here is a list of the episodes:

2385688,5,B000ADKWN2,"There are some great reviews for this wonderful anime all ready so I won't go in to any details.  However I did feel I had to comment on the ""'Oh no, I'm losing, but wait...deus ex machina!' scenarios."" that Mike Marsh spoke of in his review.

Never in this anime dose Misaki and Hikaru (the main character and her angle) ever win by new super mega weapons, or transformations or energy blasts of any sort.  There are no Super Saiyan transformations, energy fields, or magic attacks. (Although some of Misaki's opponents do have these things)

Misaki wins by being able to read her opponent's attacks and special techniques, and then find the weak spot to attack. She wins using her brain and Hikaru's speed ( Hikaru is a speed type angel but not anywhere near the fastest in the game ) to find ways to defeat her opponent.

The one exception to this, that my friend cardskipper99 pointed out to me after reading my review, is that in the very last fight of the anime Hikaru grows wings.  However she dose not use these wings to win the fight with ""champion"" so I don't think it counts.",1146787200,6,1086,4.4873096446700504
2385689,4,B000ADKWN2,"This is by no means a 'great' anime, yet I'm compelled to give it four stars. Without spoiling anything, the fights almost always consist of 'Oh no, I'm losing, but wait...deus ex machina!' scenarios. There's nothing new there, but somehow I found myself unable to stop watching, wanting to see the next fight.

What made me love this anime was the 'innocent fun' theme it carried (this is coming from a fan of Elfen Lied, about the furthest from 'innocent' you can get). If you're male, you definately need to be in touch with your feminine side to enjoy this anime. The story premise is absolutely adorable, as is the friendship the main character, Misaki, shares with her rivals in Angelic Layer.

It also has a very sad background story involving Misaki and her mother, who supposedly left for business reasons when Misaki was a little girl. If you don't at least get watery eyes in Episode 25, your heart is made of ice.

Much like The Slayers TV series, this is an anime that people of all ages can enjoy, a rare thing in a full-length series.",1139702400,5,1049,4.569148936170213

Through the game she meets lots of new friends and even unlocks secrets about her past, like the true identity of her mother and father.

This anime is mainly a fun & games type show. It has a lot of good lessons to teach about love and friendship with a descent amount of drama, but it's not upsetting drama; it's more fulfilling. I have loved every CLAMP anime I've ever seen and this is no exception. It's not as emotionally heavy as X or Tsubasa, but it's a nice change of pace. It think this is also one you can sit down and watch with the whole family. Young and old can find something charming about this little gem.",1350604800,,1042,4.262626262626263
