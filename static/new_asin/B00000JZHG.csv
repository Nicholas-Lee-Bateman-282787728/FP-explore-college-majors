No...but as sequels go, this one is not bad, Norman is his twitchy self, and the story kept my interest, it wasn't just dashed together. Anthony Perkins himself directed it, and I say he did a fine job.

1239344,5,B00000JZHG,Psycho 3 is my favorite out of the 3 Sequel's because as Did Dario Argento even Rob Zombie with Halloween 2 Tony Perkins aka Norman Bates not only starred in but directed this film which I consider art. The colors the music and plot are all extremely diffident from any of the psychos with just the right about of Scare's and yes this film is fighting with a hint of black humor.,1456185600,,379,4.277777777777778
1239345,4,B00000JZHG,"Despite having the number 3 in the title, this film is actually better than the standard slasher sequel of the 80's. Anthony Perkins returns to his signature role as the unstable hotel owner but also directs this entry. Perkins tries hard to make his own horror movie and not fall back on the Friday the 13th formula but also manages to give the movie a look and feel that fits in with the 80's slasher movies we know and love. The subplots of the emotionally unstable nun and the sleazy drifter definitely add to the story as well.

1239380,4,B00000JZHG,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this second sequel in the Psycho series...

Psycho III (1986) stars Anthony Perkins and Diana Scarwid (of Mommie Dearest fame).  This film was directed by Anthony Perkins and I thought he did a good job in the director's chair.  This movie is the most gory and graphic of all the Psycho movies and the body count is the highest as well.  This is definitely a true slasher movie, more so than the other movies in the series (even though the other movies fall into the slasher category).  In addition to lots of blood and gore, there is also lots of nudity and some black comedy here and there, elements that seem to be in so many '80s slasher/horror movies.  The musical score is quite different from the other three movies in the series, but I like it.  The one weakness to this movie is that it tries to be too many things at once - gore, nudity, comedy, etc.

This movie tanked at the box office, but time has been kind to it.  In my opinion, this movie is just as good as any quality '80s slasher movie.  It's a little cheesy at times, but so many '80s horror movies are a little cheesy.

Psycho III fits in well with the long list of '80s slasher movies and is one of the better ones, in my opinion.  Highly recommended.",1409702400,,1315,4.318367346938776
1239381,5,B00000JZHG,Great movie,1408838400,,11,5.0
1239382,3,B00000JZHG,"The worst of the sequels. Went from Norman killing as Mother and thinking it WAS Mother, trying to hide her murders, to this movie with Norman just doing the killing not even dressed up. And the only one that was full of nudity, which basically turned it into Camp Crystal Lake to me. Directed by Anthony Perkins, it was very disappointing.",1406505600,,340,4.590163934426229
1239383,3,B00000JZHG,The third installment in this series finds a young nun who flees a monastery in the desert after an attempted suicide only to come across the Bates Motel and all its hell.  A great sequel to part 2 with a higher body count.,1406419200,,223,4.186046511627907
1239384,3,B00000JZHG,"I didn't like this one as much as the first two in the series, but it still has the elements and style that make the Psycho films great. There is some comic elements to this one, which I don't think work to well here. The cast is not nearly as strong as the first two films. It seems like rehashed catch phrases and gimmicks that worked great the first time, but not so much here. Still, if you are a fan of the franchise, you will probably find something to interest you.",1405382400,,472,4.141304347826087

1239386,5,B00000JZHG,"Heck, it's Psycho.  About all you really need to know beyond that is about the picture quality and bonus features.

Sure Anthony Perkins has left us long ago which can make bonus features a bit on the light side, but any company that goes and interviews Brinke Stevens for her body double role has got my vote!  The bonus features were decent given what they had to work with and i enjoyed this very much.",1404172800,,405,4.373333333333333
1239387,5,B00000JZHG,"First off, the score for this film is very unique.  Unlike the Psychos before it, this one has Perkins in the director's chair.  AND Diana Scarwid of Mommie Dearest!  Atmospheric with religious undertones, this one has entertainment value.  When compared to Psycho II, it is considered subpar by many, considering it undid the storyline established in that movie.  But if you have an afternoon to spend at the Bates Motel, this one will hold your interest.",1404172800,,456,4.947368421052632

1239401,5,B00000JZHG,"Scarwid is excellent as the confused/ex nun.  She is the core character and semi-heroine in this film.  Directed by ""Norman Bates"" himself,  this film is fun and offers a great screenplay with a direct tie-in to Part 2:  a true sequel.  With the ""Lois Lane"" wannabe tracking ""Norman's"" every move,  to the ""Down Home"" Sheriff who delivers a slight bit of comedic relief,  to the ""Stud Budding Musician"",  all the performances were top notch and no one player can be singled out as being the ""best"".

It got to the point a little better, plus the kill scenes were muck more graphic for an 80's flick. The music score was pure genius. It had a sort of ghostly feel to it. Anthony Perkins (God rest his soul) did a terrific job as he always did. In closing this one tops it's predecessor.",1388016000,,365,3.945945945945946

1239407,3,B00000JZHG,"A surprising box office hit (and well received) ""Psycho II"" proved that there was some ""life"" in  the characters and film that Alfred Hitchcock, Joe Stefano and Robert Bloch gave birth to. The most natural thing to do when you have a hit? Take the star and make another one while the property is hot.

SPOILERS:

In the third film Norman is off his rocker again but finds himself becoming even more unbalanced when he takes in a former nun (Diana Scarwid)who reminds him of Marion Craine. He also finds himself dogged by a reporter and a guitar player (Jeff Fahey)on his way to L.A. for fame and fortune. Each takes a temporary detour to the Bates Motel with unintended consequences

END OF SPOILERS:

Although not quite as strong a film as ""Psycho II"", ""Psycho III"" was still a worthy sequel to Hitchcock's classic film. Novice director Anthony Perkins stepped into Hitch's shoes (after offering to co-direct with Richard Franklin who declined)does an exceptional job with the film staging a number of scenes from Charles Pogue's script that pay homage to Hitch's original ""Psycho"" as well as ""Vertigo"" (the opening sequence of the film).

According to screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue (in the commentary track for the film) his touch point for ""Psycho III"" wasn't the second sequel but the original film (Pogue mentions in his commentary that he didn't care for the resolution of ""Psycho II"" with its subplot about ""Mother"" but did note that he tied it up). Pogue does a good job of covering all aspects of the film including his original conception for the sequel which would have featured Janet Leigh returning as a psychatrist trying to help Norman hold on to his fragile sanity.

The special features include the commentary track with Pogue. We also get an interview with actor Jeff Fahey discussing working with Perkins and how he had his head split open during a fight.

There are also interviews with actress Katt Shea who had a small role in the film and body double Brinke Stevens. We also get an interview with Michael Westmore on the creation of ""Mother"". We also get trailers and a stills gallery.

Although ""Psycho III"" doesn't quite measure up to ""Psycho"" or ""Psycho II"", it's still an entertaining horror thriller better than most of the genre from the time. Perkins does a fine job directing the film working with Bruce Surtees to create memorable scenes.",1380844800,,2374,4.827586206896552
1239408,4,B00000JZHG,"The state of mind you watch a film in makes all the difference in the world. This is something I've faced quite a bit recently when revisiting old movies being released on Blu-ray for the first time. While I could never bring myself to say out loud that I didn't like any of the sequels to ""Psycho,"" the third one was always my least favorite. Thanks to Scream Factory, I was given a reason to refresh my memory and change my opinion after viewing the ""Psycho III"" Collector's Edition.

Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) can't seem to get a break. In the short amount of time he's been back running his infamous motel, Norman has dealt with an elaborate attempt to send him back to the nuthouse and faced a revelation about his mother that could send anyone over the edge who's already jumped off it once (or twice) before. Just as he is about to continue his renovations of the Bates Motel, a young stranger (Diana Scarwid) who resembles one of his previous victims shows up on his doorstep. Can Norman finally get out from under his mother's shadow and find love or will he slip into insanity once again?

What I once considered merely a slasher film now ties with ""Psycho II"" as one of my favorite of the sequels. Most follow-ups pale in comparison to the originals, but that's not the case with the ""Psycho"" films. ""Psycho III"" excels thanks to it being directed by the man who not only brought Norman Bates to life, but also dedicated a great portion of his life to the character and living in his shadow.

I believe Anthony Perkins did what he felt was necessary when taking the reins of ""Psycho III."" He knew there was more to tell of Norman's story, but was terrified of what might happen if someone else was put in charge of the project. Instead, he took the Director's chair and did his best to stay true to Alfred Hitchcock's cinematic vision of Robert Bloch's novel.

Perkins is given a chance in ""Psycho III"" to show the softer side of Norman to audiences. He reveals that Bates wants to be normal and have a life away from Mother. It also does a great job of showing the inner conflict he has with himself (and Mother, if you will).

It almost seems like Perkins was trying to take ""Psycho III"" where Hitchcock wanted to go with the original in regards of graphicness, but the censors at the time wouldn't allow him. There's quite a bit more sexual content and even the scenes of violence are amped up. It's as if he's trying to reach some level of shock that Hitchcock was trying to achieve but couldn't get there in 1960.

The audio and video upgrade for ""Psycho III"" gives us the film in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.85:1) and DTS Master Audio 5.1 and 2.0. The picture is a great example of clarity, while still keeping its 1980s ""real film"" flare. The surround sound immerses the viewer in the disturbing world of Norman Bates.

Some interesting special features are found on the ""Psycho III"" Collector's Edition Blu-ray. Audio commentary is provided by Screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue. There are new interviews with actors Jeff Fahey, Katt Shea, and body double Brinke Stevens. Special Makeup Effects Artist Michael Westmore shares his experience working on the film as well. It also contains a theatrical trailer for the movie.

Fans of Alfred Hitchcock's classic will find it necessary to own the ""Psycho III"" Collector's Edition. Thanks to Anthony Perkins' portrayal of Norman Bates and his personal touch as Director, you really get a deeper look into the tragic psyche of the man behind the murderer. Besides all that, we get to see more of Mother. Who doesn't want to see more of Mother?",1378771200,,3618,4.633385335413417
1239409,4,B00000JZHG,"Psycho III was directed by and stars Anthony Perkins. In the third installment, Psycho is turned more into a slasher movie.

1239420,2,B00000JZHG,"I bought the first two Psycho movies from stores. I thought the first one was decent, but I LOVED the sequel. It had a great story, great cast, good plot twists, and had me itching in suspense until the very end of the movie. I couldn't find the third movie in stores, so I ordered it online. I was excited thinking the third movie would give the same results as the second movie. Boy, was I wrong. Psycho 3 sucked. The movie was plunked down into this Friday the 13th like slasher. There was no character development, no plot twist, no suspense. It was just getting a group of attractive people and killing them off one by one. Also, the graphic violence, sex scenes, and nudity were a turn off. After watching the first two films, I held the Psycho movies to a higher standard, but Psycho 3 took the franchise to hell. I wanted to see Psycho 4 , but after this disappointment, I'll just stick to the first two films.",1367366400,,918,4.343023255813954
1239421,3,B00000JZHG,"Anthony Perkins steps behind the camera to direct this third entry into the PSYCHO series. The Bates Motel is back in business, but Norman's first patron bares a striking resemblance to an earlier victim, which forces a flood of emotion as Mother threatens to do away with the young woman. Perkins shows all of the artful enthusiasm of a first-time director, coupled with the same inexperience as well. Both the religious iconography and stylistic attempts are perceived as being heavy-handed in their approach, while the acting and dialog are far more staged than before. The added elements of nudity and gore more closely resemble the teen Slashers of the 1980s than Hitchcock's suspense thriller, which has a cheapening effect on the overall production. Yet there is a deep underlying theme of redemption and forgiveness which cannot be ignored. We continue to see Norman as a sympathetic victim, and externalize his acts as being the work of his controlling 'Mother,' who becomes the real villain once more. Notable moments include a reversal on the shower scene where Norman discovers Maureen with her wrists cut, and a playful gag where the town sheriff nearly discovers a body Norman has hidden in the new ice maker. PSYCHO 3 does not stack up to the other films in the series, but it is a worthwhile entry nonetheless.

[To place guilt on her to justify future punishment?] A passing car stops to pick her up. Dwayne Duke wants to be a musician in Los Angeles, and talks. It rains at night. Maureen continues on her journey alone. Norman Bates practices taxidermy on a small birds. [Three is a flashback to the last movie to show his character.] The motel has a new customer.

Dwayne has a new friend as a visitor. But they break up. She doesn't make a phone call for a taxi. Maureen talks to a psychiatrist in the hospital. [Will this cure her?] Tracy visits Mrs. Pool's room (to snoop). Norman takes Maureen to dinner. It starts raining. ""Did she mean a lot like you?"" Norman is sorry, it wouldn't be right.

Maureen makes a decision. Tracy reads old newspapers. A frozen body isn't easy to handle. There is a surprise in the car. Can this cause an accident?

Sometimes a meeting place for couples who are not married to each other. There is a market for that, just as there is for horror movies.

1239425,3,B00000JZHG,"Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), arguably launched the slasher genre.  After over twenty years, Psycho II (1983) continued Hitchcock's classic tale, and was a solid commercial success.  Psycho III (1986) picks up very shortly after the events in Psycho II.  Before you proceed, be advised that major spoilers follow.

In Psycho II, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is visited by a woman named Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar), who claimed to be his biological mother.  She says that the woman who raised Norman, was actually her sister.  After momentarily digesting this information, Norman strikes her on the head with a shovel, and kills her.  Psycho III begins about a month after Emma Spool's death.  Norman has become unstable again, and Emma's preserved body has been placed in his mother's bedroom.

The film opens at a convent, where Maureen Coyle (Diana Scarwid) a mentally unstable nun, is involved in an incident in a bell tower, where another nun is accidentally killed in a fall.  The scene is very reminiscent of the final scene in Vertigo, where Kim Novak's character falls to her death.  Maureen leaves the convent, and is picked up while hitchhiking by Duane Duke (Jeff Fahey), a singer on his way to LA.  Maureen is kicked out of the car, after she resists Duane's advances.

Duane stops at the motel, and is hired by Norman to manage during the daytime.  Maureen also arrives, and checks in for the night.  In the same room as Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), Norman Bates as ""Mother"" is about to repeat the infamous shower kill, but before he can strike, he finds that Maureen has slit her wrists in the bathtub in a suicide attempt.  A shocked Norman returns to normal, and calls for help.  Maureen is taken to the hospital, and later comes to stay at the motel while she recovers (her slit wrists already magically healed!).  Sheriff Hunt (Hugh Gillin) isn't too concerned that Emma Spool is missing, but LA reporter Tracy Venable (Roberta Maxwell) believes that Norman is connected to the disappearance, and is poking around looking for leads.

Anthony Perkins makes his directorial debut in Psycho III, which suffers from a lack of mystery, and only occasional develops a feeling of suspense.  With Norman returning to his homicidal ways, it seems like just a matter of time until he is caught.  Under ""Mother's"" influence, his romance with the unstable Maureen, also seems doomed to failure.  Norman sees a resemblance between Maureen and Marion, but besides short blonde hair, Diana Scarwid bears little physical resemblance to Janet Leigh, and she definitely lacks the gravitas of Janet Leigh.  Both being troubled souls, Maureen and Norman are not a good match.  With not many options available, the story follows the trail of the missing Emma Spool, with Venable investigating her last activities, and Duane pilfering her dead body in order to blackmail Norman.  Jeff Fahey does add some color as Duane, whose dark and kinky proclivities are almost as edgy and twisted as Norman.

Psycho II left the door wide open for the story to continue, and Psycho III does pick the threads nicely, but unfortunately the plot isn't very well constructed and lacks finesse, relying more on violence, sleaze, and repeating things that have been done before, to make up for a less than engaging story.  Director Perkins does a competent job with material he knows quite well, but seems to have been greatly influenced by his last film, Crimes of Passion (1984), a steamy sexually charged tale where he played a troubled minister.  Psycho III contains some nudity and sex, but Perkins was apparently interested in featuring more.  With Hitchcock's legacy in mind, producer Hilton Green, a long time collaborator with Hitchcock, apparently reminded Perkins that this would be inappropriate in a Psycho film.  With some mean kills and dark humor, Psycho II is a decent enough effort, but falls far short of either of the two previous films.  After committing murder again, you wouldn't think that Norman Bates would ever be a free man again, but that turns out not to be the case, as he returns for one last time in Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990).",1304726400,,4151,4.929496402877698
1239426,5,B00000JZHG,"People always say this film ""sold out"" and was the decline because it added too much violence.

Hell in Psycho II Mother butchered a kid in the basement. A motel manger getting his face slashed to pieces. Mother rammed a knife down a woman's throat. Norman was stabbed 5 times and grabbed a blade that sliced through his hands. Had a Dr. fall onto a knife that was already buried in his chest. Norman wacking a 90yr old lady over the head with a shovel. Yet, you never bring that up as a ""sell out"". If anything Psycho III was less of a ""sellout"" to what was going on in the 80's.

Think about it... Psycho 1 had a girl stabbed in the shower. A man falling down stairs and stabbed to death. Norman bashing a guy over the head with a heavy object.

Psycho III had a girl getting stabbed in a phone booth. A girl falling down the stairs into a statue (Norman didn't even go after her). Norman beating up a guy who stole his mother. Then drowning him... A girl getting her throat cut on a toilet bowl. THAT'S IT!

It doesn't sound far from Psycho 1 to me and Psycho II sounds worse... So I guess i don't exactly agree with you that Psycho 3 ""tried to cash in on the slasher genre"" I guess you will see it how you do.",1295395200,,1213,4.105485232067511

Anthony Perkins (may he rest in peace) plays the classic role that he made famous more than 25 years prior as Norman Bates. Mr. Perkins gives a first-rate performance as everyone's favorite kook because he is believable and there is almost a sad quality to this pathetic creature, Norman Bates. Rounding out the cast is Jeff Fahey portraying Norman's skirt-hungry motel manager and b-movie queen Diana Scarwid, playing the harried excommunicated nun who finds solace in a welcoming Norman.

1239442,2,B00000JZHG,"Psycho 3 was lousy and I agree that Psycho III was the weakest Psycho installment of them all and that Psycho II seemed to be where the Psycho installments stopped being good.

As a matter of fact, PSYCHO III seemed to be somewhat like a repeat or a reliving of how the original Psycho was since Norman Bates(Tony Perkins) was just simply reliving his days as a schizophrenic posing as both himself and his dead mother killing customers at the Bates Motel again like he did in the original Psycho, except Psycho III was a lot less heart-pounding, a lot less suspenseful, a lot less mysterious, and a lot less genuine, which is what made PSYCHO 3 lag big time, but this movies predecessors(PSYCHO I and PSYCHO II) were a lot more superb and Anthony Perkins did a much better job at playing Norman Bates in PSYCHO's I and II, but didn't do so hot in PSYCHO 3.

Therefore, the PSYCHO sequels seemed to have started losing their touch when it hit Psycho III, since it wasn't as mysterious or as blood curdling as the first two Psycho installations.  So the film makers should've done a better job at making PSYCHO III, because it's not worth the buy, unlike the original PSYCHO and PSYCHO II.

In addition to that, PSYCHO 3 was obviously not the most shocking of them all, even though it quoted ""The Most Shocking Of Them All"" on the advertisements. it was Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho I that was the most shocking of them all as well as the original and still the best to this very day, even though I liked Psycho 2 the best out of the whole Psycho series.

I also suspect that Psycho 3's reason for not being that great and for not being as genuine or a significant as the first 2 was perhaps due to the fact that Tony Perkins had directed Psycho III as well as being the main character in this movie, but I honestly don't think that Tony Perkins did nearly as much of a good job at directing this movie as opposed to directors Richard Franklin(Psycho 2) and Alfred Hitchcock(Psycho I).

In addition to why Psycho 3 wasn't as good as the first 2 Psycho's; the music score done by Carter Burwell wasn't as good nor as creepy nor as intriguing as the music scoring done by Jerry Goldsmith in Psycho II and the music scoring done in Psycho I, although Carter Burwell's music scoring isn't too shabby in general, but Jerry Goldsmith is one of my favorite music composers when it comes to movies.",1201132800,,2386,4.448512585812357

There are plenty of references to the original in both sequels and that's part of the fun. To enjoy these films you have to have a sense of humor and just go with it. Perkins is twitchier than ever in this third installment and mother is up to her old tricks! There are some good scares to be had too! The DVD transfer looks very good. I bought this in a 2 disc all 3 sequel edition of the Psycho franchise. It's well worth the price.,1187913600,,564,4.136363636363637
1239444,4,B00000JZHG,"Basically Psycho 3 is covering pretty much the same ground as the first film, but with a bit more black humor, more sex, a higher body count, and Jeff Fahey.  It abandons the psychological thriller/mystery approach of the previous film, going more for an all out slasher vibe.  That's not to say there isn't a story here coz there is.  The story just isn't terribly strong or complex this time around.  That doesn't stop it from being fun though!  Norman's trying to adjust to his new ""mother""(see part 2 for clarification on that plot point), when he gets a little more than he bargained for in the form of A) a nosy reporter out to expose him, B) a sleazy new employee(Jeff Fahey of course) who likes to pick up chicks in bars and dazzle them by waving lamps in front of his privates, and C) an ex nun who's on the run(but not played by Eric Idle or Robbie Coltrane) who is saved from an attempted suicide by Norman(ironically as he's entering her motel room to murder her).  They start a romantic relationship that doesn't settle well with Mother and the psychological tug of war begins.  Not a bad film, it's fun and it's entertaining.  Perkins is a decent director for his first time out and isn't squeamish about spilling blood.  He can still play an excellent Norman Bates I tell ya.

In Psycho III, we can see that the franchise started to go into the direction of slasher film (contrary to people who think it was a slasher film from the beginning--it was a suspense film).  Psycho III is a good film, but coming off the heels of Psycho and Psycho II allowed us to see the downfall.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with a good slasher film, but so much more was expected.

I would still recommend this film to Psycho fans who want to complete their Psycho history.  After all, any movie that continues the history of Norman Bates isn't all bad is it? (Scrap that last comment--the remake of Psycho proved that wrong).",1171670400,,781,4.426573426573427

1239448,4,B00000JZHG,"Who would have ever thunk Alfred Hitchcock's untouchable classic, ""Psycho"" would ever render a sequel? Well, it did. Three, in fact, and a remake to boot. The mere idea seems tasteless, but as ""Psycho II"" proved, there was plenty to explore with the Norman Bates character. So in comes ""Psycho III."" This time, Norman himself, Anthony Perkins, sits in the director's chair, and gives us his take on the story. What ""Psycho III"" does is give Bates' character a bit more weight than before (with help from Perkins' spot-on performance) and gives the series a bit of a boost for the times -- afterall, they had to compete with Friday's and Nightmares, people.

A nun on the run meets up with a loud-mouth wanna-be rockstar, and through a turn of events, end up at the Bates motel. The nun just wants a place to collect herself, and the rocker just wants to make (or steal) a few bucks and be on his way -- so he applies as Norman's assistant Psycho -- err, I mean manager. Well, faster than you can say ""Mother,"" things start going haywire at the hotel. Aside from a bit of budding romance for our favorite man-child, Norman manages to find trouble by way of a nosey reporter who insists on probing into his life, and a rowdy football team occupying the hotel. On top of this, mother keeps nagging him, as things seem all too familiar. Needless to say, things get out of hand. ""Psycho III"" is not without a sense of the 80's -- this puppy isn't as shy with bloodshed and nudity as it's predecessors. However, depite the trends, Perkins' installment in the series serves as a worthy sequel. Perkins handles the directing as well as he did the character. I honestly feel this movie carried his best performance as Norman, and with creative control, he proves to be the true driving force behind the character. Those who were surprised by the second movie should definitely give this one a shot.",1140912000,,1889,4.588757396449704

New visitors to the Bates motel include a suicidal ex-nun (Diana Scarwid), a sinister musician (Jeff Fahey), an investigative reporter (Roberta Maxwell), and a horde of rowdy party-goers.  Perkins's performance as Bates is always the best reason to watch any of the ""Psycho"" sequels, and in this one he steps behind the camera as well.  He does a good job.  There is a sense of atmosphere and a nightmarish frenzy to several sequences that places it several notches above the previous film.  The script (by Charles Edward Pogue) is better, too, although these continuations continue to make the mistake of trying to ""deepen"" Bates's character by giving him a more convoluted backstory.

1239460,4,B00000JZHG,"It's hard to imagine a sequel ever coming close to matching the greatness of its originator, but Psycho III in many ways, is better than Psycho. Now, before you stone me to death, read a little further.

Anyone who watches Psycho today can't help but notice how the film feels dated, like it was created in an era where sexual discussion and other issues were considered taboo. Don't get me wrong, Psycho is definitely a classic, but where Psycho III excels is in piercing those taboos and reveling in them. It's very obvious that Anthony Perkins, who not only stars as Norman Bates, but directed the film as well, feels a very personal attachment to the story. Many of us know that Perkins was homosexual and died of AIDS, and in this film, one can see him struggling with his own identity and with the forces in our culture that drive homosexuals to remain hidden. There is a very strong religious angle to the film and Perkins makes no qualm about his (seeming) disapproval of how close-minded religion can be. Now, if that isn't breaking a taboo, I don't know what is.

Psycho III also deals with sex in a very frank manner, showing us both the perverse side (the scene with Duane in his room) and the tender side (the scene with Norman and Maureen in her room). Again, Perkins tackles the issue head-on and allows us to make up our own minds. Psycho III is also the most violent of the films in the series (maybe not in terms of blood, but definitely psychologically), beginning with Norman's opening scene where he poisons a bird to his killing of several hotel guests. Perkins films the killings in a more realistic manner, making them feel more gruesome and increasing their impact.

But where Psycho III excels, and definitely surpasses Psycho, is in the creation of a fully realized Norman Bates. Perkins' performance is a wonder to behold, Norman is funny, sweet, charming, chivalrous and insane, all at the same time. And we can't help but root for him, even when he's at his craziest. Also, Norman's struggle with ""mother"" is given added dimension by being shown as more of a give and take relationship, with mother both helping and hurting Norman (previously, mother was simply a nag and a burden).

In closing, I must praise Perkins as a director. His placement of the camera, his use of imagery, the attention to performance, all come together to create a film that is truly original and a worthy sequel to Hitchcock's Psycho.

Thank you, Mr. Perkins, you gave us all a film truly worthwhile.",1128643200,,2508,4.665158371040724

The film, directed by star Anthony Perkins and released theatrically in 1986, has widely been regarded as a marked decline in quality for the Psycho series.  And I admit, I once regarded it the same way.  Unlike the relatively tame Psycho 2, the third film in the series ups the sex & violence level considerably.  This was probably a conscious attempt to compete with films of its time...remember, ""splatter"" films were big in the mid-80's.

But, like Hithcock's original masterpiece, there's more going on here than meets the eye.  Perkins the Director appears to have studied not only Hitchcock (the opening scene is straight out of VERTIGO), but other contemporary filmmakers like John Carpenter and Dario Argento.  Psycho 3 is almost equal parts fright film and black comedy...a combination that certainly describes many of Hitchcock's most successful films.

When I first saw it, i cast it aside with a dissapointed, bitter taste in my mouth. A few years have passed and I thought I would give Anthony Perkin's directorial debut another try.

Whatever missconceptions i had about this film, have now been banished after multiple viewings... I am now convinced that of all the Pycho sequels, this one is by far the most brave, if not the most well executed. It's startiling religious imagery disturbs me almost as much as the shower scene in the original.

The score is also interesting, it makes the film more disturbing because it strips away the violins of the other films, leaving only the panting gasps of victims (both those under the knife and poor Norman, underneath the gown).

You can see the influence Ken Russell had on Perkins after the two worked together, for there are moments in this film when themes such as morality and sexuality blend in a fashion that is reminicent of their earlier collaboration 'Crimes of Passion', only here it is a little more disturbing, because where Russell chooses to be loud and garish, Perkins decides to go with silence and synthisizers.

The sequence where Norman confronts his blackmailer, the scene all dim with red light and the television with cartoon's chirping- is a highlight.

An underated film that deserves to be seen again. It ballances sensitivity with the horrific and the horrific with the humourous. It also ballances homage, with originality and the familliar- with the disturbing.

He lives a quiet life managing the less than successful business, spending most of his time practicing taxidermy on the local birds that eat from his poisoned feeder. But things get all shook up again when Maureen Coyle, a young, runaway nun, enters his world. Maureen's short, blonde hair reminds Norman far too much of his most  unforgettable victim, Marion Crane, causing a myriad of conflicting feelings to well up within him. But Norman is not the only one who is disturbed and confused. Maureen has left the Church because she has so lost her faith that she recently attempted suicide and caused the death of a fellow nun who attempted to stop her. With her feelings of hopelessness and guilt, Maureen still hasn't given up on the idea of taking her own life. And Maureen is not Norman's only problem. Duane Duke, a pretty boy, would-be singing star with a dark side on his way to L.A., has come by the Bates Motel looking for a job. Norman immediately makes him Assistant Manager in charge of the day shift. But while Norman should be keeping a close eye on Duane's improper interests and activities, it's Duane who's keeping a sharp eye on him. And Duane isn't the only one. A nosy reporter has turned up in town and is asking questions about Norman, who wants nothing but to be left alone to TRY to have a normal life. Things aren't looking good for Norman at all. It's hard enough for him to battle off his mother's  urges while he attempts to start a relationship with Maureen, without having to deal with all the watching eyes springing up around him. When Duane's nocturnal sextivities and a group of anxious young sports fans eventually result in an abundance of ""sluts"" at the usually peaceful motel, it quickly becomes more than Norman, or Mother, can stand.
Anthony Perkins' directorial debut is an excellent example of how not all sequels, even number threes, have to stink. In fact, except for the Bates Motel series pilot ""movie"" that didn't have Perkins in it at all, I'd have to say all the Psycho films are pretty darn good. None of the sequels make any attempt to be Hitchcockian, yet they all keep the stories and characters intact and a step above the usual slasher fair. The duality of the Norman Bates character that Hitchcock presented so well in the original is clearly what gives the sequels so much to work with. This man's entire life is interesting and worth chronicling, not just that first major incident in the 60s. Of course, as with the other sequels, this film is in color, and quite gory and sexual, unlike the original classic film. But this just helps to provide a nice separation for those who dislike sequels and feel the Hitchcock Masterpiece should have been left alone.

1239479,5,B00000JZHG,"Made famous by a certain director that we all know and a few shocking scenes that we still remember, Norman Bates was birthed. Powered by a need to kill and by a madness we all saw transpire, finding the thoughts of a woman that couldn't be, that shouldn't be, and yet that spoke to her son from beyond the grave. Then there was his twenty-two year stint after his insanity plea, his would-be freedom being tampered by victims not cured along with the killed, and the rekindling of a fire. And now, well, we have the beastly Bates once more.
This installation sees Anthony Perkins, the only person that could actually place the role, once again coming back and playing the part of Norman. From the introduction of his character poisoning birds in a birdbath outside his home to him doing taxidermy on them while eating, you simply know that he is going to come through for you. And he certainly does, delving deeper in the Norman mindset. Then enters the sparks that the fire needs to be kindled in a disturbed young woman and a guitar-playing jerk that picked her up hitchhiking. Add to that a reporter that asks Norman to do a piece on his side of the insanity defense before snooping a little too much,, a few words about a missing woman in town, a suicide attempt, and love and you have the set-up for potentially horrific things to take place.
No matter how many movies I see on the subject, the idea of a psychotic mingling in with society and how he manages to do it talks to me. The more times I'm exposed to that presence, to that entity, the more I am enticed by something that I don't understand but that I am intrigued by because it is so foreign. That's because its not simply the deed, but the horror pulling its strings, that are fascinates me. Take Norman Bates, for example. While being known for the ""shower scene"" that has taken place in the past, he's actually committed a number of other crimes - being somewhat driven back into insanity in the second installation - beyond that. Why? Because of his dead mother still speaking to some outlet within his might. and what caused that? Trauma perhaps, the inability to cope with the killing of her or the being alone manifesting her and, therefore, giving her live. This has plagued him over the years, but all the while there is something about him, the innocence of being haunted and mad but not a true monster, that surrounds him. He doesn't mean to do any harm, but his mother, she won't leave him alone. So he finds that himself involved in a game that he really doesn't understand or control; always thinking himself a trapped little boy acting as his mother's grave.
Then comes brutality to it all, something that interests me as well. Here, you see the opposing end of the spectrum, the victim, being broadcaster. The plight of someone that you can somehow cling to as they meet fade in a phonebooth or in some forgotten motel room because of this haunted man, it adds a duality. And here, in this instance, the duality is bloody and brutal enough to make one cringe.

1239480,4,B00000JZHG,"Psycho 3 is more of a remake of the original film then a sequel and it's way better then the 1998 remake. Anthony Perkins returns to his most famous role of Norman Bates and makes his directorial debut in the second sequel to Hitchcock's classic masterpiece. In this one,a rehabilitated Norman tries to help out a disturbed young woman named Maureen Coyle who looks so much like Marion Crane who was the shower victim in the original film and gives a job to a drifter named Daune Duke(just call him Duke).It isn't long before Mother starts up her old ways again and pretty soon the bodies start to pile up in the swamp behind the Bates Motel again. What I think makes Psycho 3 an entertaining sequel is the dark humor in it. When it's all said and done,it's a good sequel to Hitchcock's masterpiece.",1055116800,,799,4.517241379310345

Psycho 2 was an excellent original sequel.
Psycho 3 is a joke.  After an excellent twist at the end (Norman's real mother( the series should have finished on that note.  Yes, a sequel could have been made but what would have been the point in rehashing the original idea?  Psycho 3 is basically a repeat of Psycho minus the action, camerawork, acting and, oh, pretty much everything else.  The plot mirrors practially mirrors Psycho, a woman seeks refuge in a motel but the difference is she falls in love with Norman. However as she grows to know Norman better she starts to suspect things are not as they seem.  As the bodies pile up Tracy must decide whether this is the work of Norman or nothing more.

1239484,3,B00000JZHG,"Psycho III is a film that leaves you with a sense of dissatisfaction. On the temperature scale, it's lukewarm. Nothing about it is particularly bad, and nothing is particularly good. Don't get me wrong, there are genuine moments of excellence. Perkins' clear familiarity with his character is exploited to pleasing effect, in the recreation of his hobbies, his habits, his mannerisms. The atmosphere of the motel and its desert location are also evoked better here than in any of the other films, with its dusty forecourt and the evocation of dry, piercing desert wind. These moments, however, do not compensate for what the film lacks, which are some of the more essential elements of a horror film (most notably tension). Still, it's entertaining, and certainly worth taking a look at. Diana Scarwid is very nice to watch, with her tormented nun on the run a very original infusion into the series.
As for the DVD, the picture and sound quality are fine, but there really is no excuse for the lack of original widescreen formatting.",1034467200,,1034,4.914285714285715
1239485,3,B00000JZHG,"Anthony Perkins is back in his trademark role of the weird and creepy motel-owner Norman Bates. With this movie Perkins also makes his debut as a director.
A third installment of the Psycho series at first glance seems like perhaps a little too much. The pleasant return of the familiar cast (ofcourse with the obvious exception of those who got killed in the first two movies) is a good start. Fairvale and it's citizens are as recognisable as ever.
The story revolves around reporter Tracy Venable, who has arrived at Fairvale to figure out if there's perhaps a little more to Norman Bates than meets the eye.
I would say that this might be a good movie for you to watch if you loved the two prequels as much as I did. I couldn't get enough of that creepy old house on the hill and Norman's struggle against insanity.
But the one important thing you have to keep in mind - the factor that will decide whether or not you'll like this movie - is that the overall feel of this third installment is very different from the first two movies. There's certainly no guessing on ""who's done it?"" here! Although athmospheric, Psycho III is not a thriller. It's more than anything else, a stalk-and-slash movie. And a pretty decent one.
I admit that the quality of this movie simply is no match for it's two predecessors, but the fact remains I really liked it anyway.",1030838400,,1359,4.528455284552845

The script is weak, relying on comedy and the audience's knowledge of the previous Psycho Films for many of its laughs.

zoom into Mrs. Spool's middle finger that Duke stuck up.
The scene where Norman spreads peanut butter on his
cracker with the same spoon he stuffed the bird with

This film is much better than ""Psycho II"" and is a better follow up to the original. Director Perkins shows some real innovative techniques and provides some real chilling scenes along the way. In ""Psycho II"" Bates was a clich. In this one he is a real person and we see just how warped and twisted he really is. He remains sympathetic to the audience because he can not escape what he has become or reverse the wrong he has done. We get the impression that his mind has become like a vibrating tuning fork where the harmonics of right and wrong, good and evil have become blurred beyond distinction and are no longer comprehendible to the pathetic Bates.
