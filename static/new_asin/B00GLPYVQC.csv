6081041,1,B00GLPYVQC,"This series has the distinction of being the Happy Days spin-off which did NOT succeed in the ratings.

Since Scott Baio and Erin Moran are trying to (unfortunately) sing in the opening credits and throughout episodes themselves, I really can't tell you why this series got the complete go-ahead for release. Meanwhile we're waiting for the entire series of Happy Days to come out on DVD. Unless their ""singing"" is 'the reason' why: the studio did not have to worry about getting around licensing issues of any kind with anybody remotely important.

I really did not know the word to describe it as a little kid, but now I'd say that they don't sound 'romantic' or 'endearing'. Their numbers sound suicidal. This isn't an atmosphere you'd what you want when you're trying to eat a nice plate of homemade Italian food. The whole plot of moving from Wisconsin was to sing in 'a restaurant' where they're going to and build a career in show business. .

But casting/scripting apparently did not think things through (other than they were attached with Happy Days and were the 'teenagers' of the show). Like finding out if they could themselves sing in the first place.

Remember, the Partridge Family had 'studio musicians' for their episodes.  And you can't sell food or music if you can't convince your customers that 'you' can successfully even sing. Yikes! Scott Baio himself honestly tries. And I'll actually give hiim credit for this. He was not afraid to do it himself. But this is what made the whole concept ultimately unrealistic and therefore unwatchable.

So after a half season and one with less than promising ratings, they came 'home' with no further dreams of stardom.

It's embarrassing that this series made it to DVD before the show whose artifacts are on permanent display in the Smithsonian!!",1390435200,3,1810,4.8762214983713354
6081042,4,B00GLPYVQC,"I vaguely remember the episodes themselves except for the way they did the theme song of the show.  Chachi was at the piano and Joanie was singing along with him to perform the theme of the show.  It was very unique at that time since many shows had their themes done beforehand with prerecorded music.  I always liked shows that had singing and comedy skits in them or in other words, variety shows such as The Carol Burnett Show.  Reality shows just don't do it for me since television watching should entertain and take you away from today's scary realities for at least one or two hours.  This however is just my opinion about our entertainment medium(television, radio, or music).",1388275200,8,685,4.675
6081043,1,B00GLPYVQC,"Writing this several weeks before this set is even released prevents commenting on technical aspects of the DVDs, but it can be said that the fact that the first ""season"" was only four episodes and the second one only 13 episodes speaks to both the quality and popularity of this ""Happy Days"" spinoff that followed ""Laverne and Shirley"" and ""Mork and Mindy.""

This is despite this series starring then uber-teen idol Scott Baio playing the role that granted him that status and that he later revived on ""Happy Days."" Further, these 17 episodes should be put in the context of Baio's later horrible series ""Charles in Charge,"" which ran for a few full seasons.

Additionally, stating on the cover of the DVD set that it contains all 17 episodes would be more forthcoming than stating that it includes two seasons.

Even the ""Three's Company"" spinoffs ""The Ropers"" and ""Three's a Crowd"" lasted 28 and 22 episodes respectively.

This set frankly is not worth the roughly $28 that it is going for considering that it is often easy to find sets of complete 22-24 episode series of sitcoms new and old between $10-15. (I recently bought a bundle of the first four seasons of ""Happy Days"" for $32, or $8/season.)

6081057,5,B00GLPYVQC,"Somewhat lost under the story layers of young love, artists trying to find their big break, and the turmoil of living as Italian-Americans in a morally bankrupt early 1960's Chicago is the groundbreaking and earth-crushing sound uncorked on network TV by the Chachi fronted band Dismembered Hooves. Serving as a precursor to the black, death, and thrash metal genres, ABC put their necks on the line by putting together a relatively unknown crew of talented musicians with chops for days to serve as the creative backdrop to the ""Joanie Loves Chachi"" story.

While the strangely solemn ballad ""Feast of Serpent Bones"" is the show's defining song as it hauntingly plays over the opening credits, the deeper cuts sprinkled throughout the shamefully brief run of ""Joanie Loves Chachi"" are what put Dismembered Hooves' catalog in the upper echelons of heavy music. Take Season 1 Episode 2 ""The Performance."" While trying to impress record producer Don ""Buzz"" Jackson, Chachi and bandmates unleash a punishing 11-minute version of ""Cthulhu Awaken."" Gnashing his way through lyrics like ""Goats' eyes glistening against winter's wall/My savior in death begs to kill us all,"" it is impossible to ignore Chachi's raw and menacing sound. The blistering apocalyptic boom coming from Joanie, Annette, Mario, and Bingo only furthers the sonic violence. The performance is somewhat lost on Jackson's young daughter and her birthday party guests, but for fans of heavy music that tuned in that week, we were justly rewarded.

Another signature episode is Season 2's ""Fonzie's Visit."" Fonzie's appearance certainly was a rating triumph for the network, and Dismembered Hooves made sure that the large TV audience received the aural punishment they craved with a version of ""Pestilence in A Minor"" so powerful in its annihilation that it that left a smoldering crater in the 8:30 Eastern (7:30 Central) Thursday time slot that may still be visible from space. ""Arms bound in torture/a rotting corpse of one/without mercy to beg for/disemboweled spirit mine"" were lyrics carved with unholy claws into our collective psyche forever.

For reasons I will never understand, this show failed to command enough in the way of ratings. This deserved a far longer run. No matter, though, this box set will remind us of the powerful onslaught that ""Joanie Loves Chachi"" unfurled on society for 17 glorious nights in the early 80's. Music would never be the same, and, for that reason alone, I love ""Joanie Loves Chachi.""",1459900800,,2492,5.163366336633663

6081061,3,B00GLPYVQC,"It's been a LONG time (over three decades now) since the much-hyped Joanie Loves Chachi first aired on network TV, basically a spin-off from Happy Days which initially held much promise, but was ultimately short-lived as the series failed to gain momentum and never really found its niche or target audience.

The premise of the series features Joanie & Chachi together and now living in Chicago as they try and pursue a music career.  Al (Al Molinaro) tags along too and apparently has gone from managing greasy-spoon diners to an upscale Italian restaurant, where Joanie and Chachi (and apparently the others) made their residence upstairs.  The charming Ellen Travolta plays the role of both mom and mentor here, and we have Art Metrano rounding out the pack as their goofy, yet loveable manager.

As you might have guessed, the chaos and pressures of trying to kick start a career in showbiz along with a rather eccentric manager that kept booking them in dud after dud venues, causes the usual hilarity and silliness to ensue here.  Sure, some of the plots and storylines were a little over the top, but it was all very kitschy.  Looking back now, the show wasn't half as bad as I remembered it, but the formula never really seemed to work.  Perhaps the series was simply an anachronism, a sitcom that was conceived outside its time and place?  Whatever your feelings and opinion, it's sure to evoke a few smiles as you take a stroll down memory lane here.

After dismal ratings, ABC decided to pull the plug.  It was all over after only 17 episodes.  However, I think it's still worth watching if only for the entertainment value and nostalgia.  And who didn't like the catchy opening theme?  All in all, I give it a 5 out of 10.  Not the best sitcom ever devised, but hardly the worst.  It seemed to grow on me as I watched and recalled all those old episodes again.  This is the kind of stuff you curl up on the couch with on a rainy/dreary day.

Watching it as an adult, I still remember those feelings and I still think it has a young, sweet romance.  I loved watching the episodes again and am so glad that I was able to purchase it.  It was really fun to hear the theme song again too because after all of these years, I still remembered all the words to the song.  I played the song about 20 times when I first got the DVD just because it was so good to hear.  I found it was still a fun show and actually laughed out loud a bunch of times.

This is one of my favorites now of all of Scott Baio's performances...his character is cute and charming but not too innocent either. The chemistry between all the characters is completely believable, and the lines are funny! The only negative is, in my opinion, the opening credits. What a depressing-sounding song. For a romantic comedy, couldn't they have picked a more upbeat song? Other than that, I wish there had been more episodes of this show!

6081079,2,B00GLPYVQC,"Set in the 1960's, this `Happy Days' spin-off series that debuted on ABC in the Spring of 1982 that pertained to Joanie Cunningham(Erin Moran) and her boyfriend Chachi Arcola(Scott Baio), who move to Chicago and start a rock band, often performing at his family's Italian restaurant, but had tanked after only 2 months, due to weak ratings since it was ranked at #17 as 25 Biggest TV's Blunder list since people argued that Joanie & Chachi wasn't what viewers wanted to see since it was the ""Fonz""(Henry Winkler)who reeled in the viewers to HAPPY DAYS, which resulted in JOANIE LOVES CHACHI's cancellation in the Summer of 1982 with Baio and Moran returning to HAPPY DAYS in its final season.

This short-lived sitcom also takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch it after HAPPY DAYS every Tuesday night on ABC when I was 9 years old in the 3rd grade and when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was President.",1395187200,4,987,4.576271186440678
6081080,5,B00GLPYVQC,"For those who loved ""Happy Days"" comes this spin-off series where Joanie is grown up into a beautiful teenager, living away from home, has a boyfriend, and sings in a dysfunctional band.

In this series you will get to see Joanie (Erin Moran), Chachi (Scott Baio), Al (Al Molinaro), Lorisa (Ellen Travolta) as Chachi's parents who own a family restaurant, Rico (Art Metrano), the manager of the band and father to Mario and Anentte who are part of the band along with Banjo, the out-of-this-world drummer. There are appearances by Fonzie (Henry Winkler), Marion Cunningham (Marion Ross), and Howard Cunningham (Tom Bosley) as Joanie's parents.

If you love a show that has lots of singing, comedy, some of the great actors from that other fantastic series, and two teenagers who are trying to make a life of their own, then this wonderfully short series is sure to captivate and hold you for all the 17, 1/2 hour episodes.

As you will see, it not always smooth sailing to be in a band, to be young and in love, trying to live your own life, but all this dissolves as the good times take over your life. So be transported back to a time when days were happier, and you were just starting to find your own way in life.",1394755200,2,1217,4.5479452054794525

Joanie Loves  Chachi was spun off from Happy Days, which already had the spin offs of  Laverne and Shirley and Mork & Mindy. This show lasted almost two seasons

Erin Moran and Scott Baio with  Al Molinaro (Al) transfer from Happy Days cast  with semi ease. Moran and Baio make a cute couple. Their  pairing in this show works as a couple who have a start up band. They already feel comfortable as the characters..maybe because their Characters were firmly established on Happy Days This cutesy sitcom of the 1980's  makes a case for good TV, not the reality shows of today.

  With any sort of TV  spin off, the original Happy Days Cast members (Maron Ross, Tom Bosley and Henry Winkler ) crossed over for visits in this series. It had many of the production team of Happy Days are also  involved, so you knew it had the same quality as Days or the other spin offs from producer Garry Marshall

I hate to say it, I enjoy this complete series of 18 episodes. I would watch this show on TV Land anytime. Wonder why this is not on TV Land, Antenna TV or Me-TV

6081085,2,B00GLPYVQC,"No doubt trying to further the success brought on by such hit shows as Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley, the creators aimed for yet another spin-off. Unfortunately this one was a bit of a flop...largely because the show essentially lacks a true plot.

In the pilot, viewers learn that Chachi Arcola (Scott Baio) has just moved to Chicago with his mother Louisa (Ellen Travolta) and her new husband Al Delvecchio (Al Molinaro) to open an Italian restaurant. The teenage Chachi is devastated, largely because his girlfriend Joanie Cunningham (Erin Moran) is still in Milwaukee.

Then Chachi finds he's got the opportunity to sing in a band, under the direction of his ""manager"" (aka his Uncle Rico). Chachi is quick to recommend Joanie as the female vocal, and with his cousins Annette and Mario, and a spaced-out surfer named Bingo, a band is born.

Most times, the group performs at Delvecchio's, although Chachi - whose dream is to become professional - seeks out other gigs.

The main problem here is that this is essentially the entire plot of the show. The actors are good; presumably, many viewers of this show tuned in specifically for them, already being familiar with them from Happy Days. But there is little for most of them to do, save stand around supporting Chachi's musical dreams. Despite Louisa and Al just having opened a new business, we see and hear very little of it, except - of course - when it involves the band. And Chachi and Joanie themselves seem to have little personality outside the music.

Oh, did anyone mention that Joanie loves Chachi? There's that, too. Viewers are treated to a small squabble between the two each episode, but it's quickly resolved and of no real consequence to the couple.

6081090,5,B00GLPYVQC,"Reading the other reviews,  a few things stand out...

1  The actors had a wonderful chemistry that made the episodes work.
2  But the writing and series concept left a lot to be desired.
3  Joanie can sing!  Chachi did ok in keeping up with her, but really it should have been Joanie singing and Chachi doing something else.  Maybe he could have gotten a job as an 'in charge' male nanny...  (I think he did a few years later...)

The producers got stuck with the concept of them singing because the Happy Days episodes with them singing were quite well received and ABC wanted yet another hit spinoff from the series.  They forgot that those Happy days episodes usually had other things like well written scripts and the Fonz to keep things moving along nicely.

The main appeal was in the two lead actors eye appeal, Joanie for the boys and Chachi for the gals.  Actual characters for band members that could stand out like the Fonz did early on in the parent series might have helped.  But the band was a waste as was Chachi's family, who were apparently only there so the series could allow underage Joanie to live in another city with her boyfriend.

The first 4 episodes were a big hit in the ratings in the spring.  Following the Happy Days series on Tuesday evenings surely helped.  So a full fall season pickup seemed like a great Idea.  But then they moved the show to another day...

Thursday.
Magnum PI.
Starring Tom Selleck, a hot red car, babes, mysteries, a British butler, and Hawaii!

You may have heard of that show.  It was number one and/or in the top ten every year from a few years before J.L.C. premiered to many more years afterward.  Our two singing sweethearts never stood a chance against Magnum, and were dumped after 13 weeks in season 2..

Luckily, both the 2 lead actors and their characters were still beloved enough by the fans to return to Happy Days and wrap up their storyline in the final season and finale of that series.",1392336000,4,1960,4.492917847025495
6081091,4,B00GLPYVQC,"I first learned of this 1982 sitcom via a VH1 ""I Love the '80s"" program aired during the early 2000s. Mind you, ""Happy Days"" (the show from which this series was spun off) was before my time. So, my main familiarity was with Scott Baio from his later ""Charles in Charge"" days. How exciting, almost a decade after seeing excerpts, then, to finally have the chance to see the complete (but unfortunately, short) run of ""Joanie Loves Chachi""!

I was not disappointedin fact, I was pleasantly surprisedin the quality of this series. It's lighthearted (and admittedly has some quite cheesy moments). But what really stands out to me about each episode is the natural and believable chemistry of the whole cast. It doesn't hurt that the primary setting (the family restaurant/house) also looks very real. Add to this equation the presence of at least one musical performance in almost every show, and you've got quite a fun 25 minutes of comedy each time.

The romantic relationship between Joanie and Chachi (as well as their work together in a band that performs in the family restaurant) is the primary focus. Scott Baio and Erin Moran deliver their lines and actions in an authentic way which distracts from any reality gaps in the scripts. They are also capable vocalists who make the musical performances more than a mere novelty aspect of the show. Also, of note, however, are the scenes between Chachi's parents (played by Helen Travolta and Al Molinaro). Joanie and Chachi's bandmates also add to the fun.

The only thing that's missing from this DVD release to make it an over-the-top success are any bonus features. Since (amazingly) all of the main cast members are still alive as of this writing, it would've been wonderful to see some new interviews with them about the showor even hear their commentary on a few episodes. But I suppose that CBS DVD (probably accurately) assumed that the audience for this release would not be large enough to warrant the cost of including such features.

Most importantly, ""Joanie Loves Chachi"" stands as a notably delightful early 1980s sitcom with both charming reminders of the era in which it was produced and timeless portrayals of a close-knit and caring family and couple. The 17 episodes of the series' run definitely left me wanting more. The cast and directors truly did a fine job of pulling this viewer in. I don't hesitate to recommend this DVD release to anyone who is fond of heartwarming, comedic shows with that dreamy touch of the early '80s.",1391817600,24,2503,4.841121495327103
6081092,4,B00GLPYVQC,"Watched a few episodes as I just got the DVD and I see a lot of negative reviews on here but come on was Happy Days Laverne and Shirley and Mork and Mindy any better? They were all intended to be  fluff and cutesy comedy ..so who cares what all you negative people think!!!!!!  . I would watch this over a reality show of today any day...I like the music parts too. I was surprised with Scotts popularity at the time the series only ran 17 shows
Now can they bring Angie with Donna Pescow to DVD. Another good show gone too soon!!",1391558400,26,530,4.135922330097087
6081093,2,B00GLPYVQC,"A mere seventeen episodes constitutes the entirety of Joanie Loves Chachi: The Complete Series. As slight as that sounds, I found this slim three-disc set to be an overdose of sub-Laverne and Shirley unfunniness, songs that would never threaten and hit lists during any era, supporting characters not even their own mothers could love, and storylines so bereft of originality the second to last episode actually resorted to using Happy Days flashbacks!

Do I sound unnecessarily harsh? If so, it's because I'm pissed off at how little apparent interest creator Garry Marshall and company had in delivering a series worth watching. First, there's the concept: Joanie and Chachi decide to chase their dreams and sing with a band, playing nightly at Delvecchio's restaurant. Think about that for a momentWhen you go out for a nice Italian dinner, do you really want a rock group thrashing away at songs you've never heard before, and being sung by a man with a tin throat? Scott Baio is many thingsincredibly charming, handsome, and when given the chance, a fine actorbut musical is not one of them!

And then, there's the rest of ""the band,"" who never actually rate a name. On bass guitar is Chachi's cousin Annette (Winifred Freedman); a cute, sweet and (slightly) chubby girl who gets routinely pelted with fat and ugly jokes. Nice, right? Annette's brother Mario (Derrel Maury) plays keyboards; a fairly good lookingif somewhat anonymouskid, distinguished only by his pork pie hat. Finally, there's drummer Bingo (Robert Pierce), who wears Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts, has a bushy blond perm, and speaks entirely in non-sequiturs, sounding just like Jeff Spicoli from Fast Times At Ridgemont High. That's right, he's a ""surfer dude""in Chicago.

You want comedy? Here's a sample of what passes for witty repartee.

Al: ""Bingo, listen, the band is late again. Now, we can't wait forever. Isn't there something you can do?""
Bingo: ""If you could get me a bowl of cereal, I can pick out the riboflavin.""

Here's more.

(Chachi is clearing tables at the restaurant when he sees Joanie's ex-boyfriend enter, and take a seat. Hoping to avoid a confrontation, Chachi darts behind the bar, where Mario is standing, and crouches down next to him.)

Mario: ""You know, Chachi, when you crouch down like that, you're the exact height as my grandmother.""

Unfortunately, Paramount's DVD presentation of Joanie Loves Chachi: The Complete Series suits the middling-to-awful material all too well. The 1.33:1 standard def full frame image looks pretty good, but many of the episodes suffer from flicker at the top of the frame, and the pilot appears to have taken a bit of a beating (watchable, but roughed-up). The Dolby 2.0 Mono audio is more successful, clearly amplifying Mr. Baio's vocal performances, so beware. (Note: According to Mr. Todd Fuller, founder of the excellent Sitcoms Online website, several episodes have had musical numbers edited out!) Subtitles have been provided, but nothing else, which is curious, as all the major cast members, Marshall, and many of the show's runners are still among the living. Again, that seeming total lack of interest on their part.

Lest I leave you with the impression that Joanie Loves Chachi was among the very worst endeavors in TV series history, I feel obligated to mention there were some obviously talented performers involved (who couldn't love Molinaro and Travolta?). But somehow their efforts were squandered or taken for granted, if not altogether ignored. I'm speaking specifically of Erin Moran. By the time this series bowed, the then twenty one year old actress was a fifteen year showbiz veteran, who'd grown from a freckled tomboy into a stunningly beautiful woman with an incredible singing voice. In this critic's humble opinion, no bigger mistake was made by the spin-off's producers than their decision to make Moran a junior partner in the musical element of the series. Check out her amazing slow-burn rendition of early '60s classic ""He's So Fine"" at the end of the episode ""Term Paper."" It'll blow your mind.
