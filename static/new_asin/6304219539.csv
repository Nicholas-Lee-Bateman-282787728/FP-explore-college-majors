7865248,4,6304219539,"Intelligent if slightly awkward melding of a gritty, sad drama of life of the street for working class
prostitutes in the UK, and a somewhat more melodramatic and soapy (if sometimes quite tense)
serial killer thriller.

Unlike `Klute' where the world of hustling and thriller melded seamlessly, here there is a bit more
schizophrenia between the elements. For me, the crime sections, while sometimes effective, were
also quite familiar, and felt like TV and movies I'd seen many times before, whereas the portrait of
the day to day lives of hustlers felt like much more interesting and less often explored in a
non-exploitive way. The killings and investigation feel oddly grafted on.",1350864000,,685,5.116071428571429

While the first was excellently acted, the second graduates from the realistic to the atmospheric, with the central characters, two prostitutes (Cathy Tyson, Geraldine James),one semi-prostitute (Barbara Dickson) and a mother of a fellow streetwalker slain in the first season (I can't remember her name) trying to change their lives through having established a cleaning service. This doesn't last, as they are caught in a spiral of corruption, murder, drug use, heartbreak, suicide, and finally, some semblance of a happy ending for at least one of the characters (Tyson). The performances by Tyson,James,Dickson, Samantha Morton, Tony Doyle, David Bradley, etc. are excellent. This drama is very intense, grim to the point of depressing, yet demonstrates two things: how difficult it is for prostitutes to leave ""the lane"" and start a new life; that the best dramatic product in the English language does,basically, emanate from the U.K.",984960000,4,1111,5.247191011235955
