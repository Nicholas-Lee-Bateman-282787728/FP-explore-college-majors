2736214,4,B000MJCM1O,"I remember seeing this in the movie theater when I was a child living in Puerto Rico.  I always liked this Alaskan forest female version of Tarzan.  Though the acting is not great, the scenery is not bad.  The situation may not be believable, a girl raised from the time she was seven by wolves, but the point of any movie is to suspend belief and enjoy it.  I have this film on VHS, but I hope that it will be released to DVD very soon in a pristine, re-mastered condition.  Recommended for fans of films of this type.",1394064000,5,519,4.202020202020202
2736215,2,B000MJCM1O,"This thing is total camp.

It features a bunch of Z-grade acting talent following a Z-grade script on sets with laughable production values.

True, you get to see Adam West (the guy who would play Batman in the sixties TV-series and who is now voicing the mayor on Family Guy) talking to an animal with his shirt off and there are some really dull static shots of the woman in a white dress who was... what? Raised by wolves? Adopted by beavers? I could sit through the whole thing to find out after the first time I saw the first shot of her straight-back-from-the-forehead, nature-girl hair-do.

The actors are bad. The Wolves are largish dogs and the script should have a whole new word invented for it that means, ""anything but good.""

Get a six-pack of something and rent it for laughs.",1363737600,2,791,4.549295774647887
2736216,3,B000MJCM1O,"Critics of TV violence have counted hundreds, even thousands of violent scenes in Walt Disney pictures. This film can be recommended to children over 10 years old, I guess. It is frightening to watch Mara's parents get killed by a bear. Adam West from Batman does well as the game warden who wants to rescue Mara from an evil fur trapper. He discovers her taking a bath in a pond near the company of her wolf companions. Is it true that the fight scene at the end was longer on video tape? It seems to be.",1212537600,2,505,4.270833333333333

2736227,5,B000MJCM1O,"I love the plot.  I've seen several movies with a similar theme but felt this one pulled it off better than most.  I think the sound track along with the the cinematography helped immensely.  The mood music changing from mysterious to adventurous well befitting the scene.  Also, I'm a product of this time period myself.  I like to see movies without all the blood and gore which usually  just distracts from the story line in my opinion.  I know many will think it's too Walt Disney for their liking but then I've always been a fan.",1419897600,2,534,4.5

2736231,4,B000MJCM1O,"A little girl named Mara (Lelia Walsh) and her parents go on an excursion deep in the Alaskan wilderness. Dad's an anthropologist, there to study the fauna. Shockingly, the animals are wild! One of them, a ""bear"" attacks and kills mum and dad, leaving Mara alone in the woods. Providentially, a pair of ""wolves"" decides to raise Mara as their own. Twelve years later, Naturalist Ken Williams (Adam West- ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS, TV's BATMAN) Is writing a thesis on wolves, and heads in the direction of a now fully grown, and stunningly beautiful, Mara (Lori Saunders). There's also an eeevil hunter in the area. We know he's especially eeevil due to the nasty way he treats his Indian guide, and because ""eeevil hunter"" music plays whenever his eeevil, bald head appears. Can Williams find, get acquainted, and escape w/ Mara before the hunter messes things up? Mara spends most of her time running around w/ her wolf friends in her loincloth, or swimming around in her (strategically obscured) loincloth-less-ness. All this, while sporting the world's biggest wild-woman wig! As silly as MOTW was, I still had fun watching it...",1411776000,8,1130,4.9526315789473685

8169394,5,B000MJCM1O,It was an awesome classic movie. Lori saunders was wearing what a woman would ve worn if stranded on an island and have to family with wolves. Lori Saunders is absolutely beautiful. Starring Adam West and Denver Pyle. You are rooting for Adam West because hes trying tyo help Mara and save her from the perpetrators who are after the animals. I also get tired of action and horror gore. How many of those can you watch? This was a clear different. Its a classic movie a nd deserves more attention.

8169397,5,B000MJCM1O,"--loved it as a kid, saw it first when I was 7. I wanted to be Mara, lol
A bit tedious watching it as an adult, and it brought back great memories for me and from my childhood.
Except for the parents being killed by a bear, it is good family fun. The fist fight scenes were pretty well choreographed.
Be sure and remind your kids that it's ""only a movie"", no persons or animals were hurt during the filming.
And no, your little girls don't get to be Mara... except in make-believe. ;-)",1447372800,,485,4.170212765957447
8169398,4,B000MJCM1O,The thing that got me was Mara was wearing a wolf skin right down to the tail. I guess the wolves didn't mind her killing (it was a beautiful PRIME hide not from an old dying animal) and then skinning one of the family group. Good family time movie.
