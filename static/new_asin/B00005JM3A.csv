1475191,5,B00005JM3A,This product came to me quickly and in great condition.  I thoroughly enjoyed my purchase.,1258848000,,90,5.0
1475192,4,B00005JM3A,"SINCE I PERSONALLY FIND SO MUCH OF CURRENT PROGRAMING UNACCEPTABLE, WE ARE ENJOYING THIS SERIES VERY MUCH. THEY ARE JUST AS GOOD NOW AS WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT. THEY RECYCLE SO MANY THINGS, HOW ABOUT THIS?",1254182400,,206,4.594594594594595
1475193,5,B00005JM3A,"I started out with the 1st season and now await the delivery of the 5th season...If ever there was a TV character to fall in love with it was Dr. Sam Beckett!  These episodes are as great today as they were ""back in the day"".  Dean Stockwell (Al) is just as cute and funny and Scott Bakula (Sam) just as ""hot"".  I loved the interviews and the quality is great!  One of televisions most imaginative creations, something that is sorely lacking in the swamp of today's ""reality"" shows. I have introduced the series to my nieces and nephews and they love it!  Pay attention TV moguls -- This is Entertainment.",1245542400,,605,4.463636363636364
1475194,5,B00005JM3A,I am very happy with this product and the shipping was very quick and easy.,1244073600,,75,4.066666666666666
1475195,4,B00005JM3A,THIS SEASON IS EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST.... MORE ACTION AND DEALS WITH MORE ISSUES etc.,1242259200,,89,4.625
1475196,3,B00005JM3A,"In M.I.A....when Sam realizes Al is connected to Beth and sees her picture...the song ""This Guy's in Love"" by Herb Alpert plays...at the end ""Georgia On My Mind"" of course...instead we get stock-filler elevator crap.

And the leap-in for ""One Strobe Over the Line"" was Fingertips by Stevie Wonder...PERFECT FOR THAT LEAP..when I first saw it I felt like..wow...they captured the differences from the leap previous to the next..the former of the two leaps being set in the early 60's, and the next in the mid 60's..hairstyles different....the times not as innocent...QL did this with gusto....a late 60's episode was completely different from a mid 60's, mid 70's, or early 50's episode...""A Single Drop of Rain"" could have been a leap from Al's lifetime whereas ""Good Morning Peoria"" the episode with Jerry Adler from the Soprano's,  ""Miss Deep South"" and ""Rebel Without a Clue"", ...captured the 50's as they were coming into their own..and then we have M.I.A. which was more the grittiness of the streets of the california streets in the 60's...with that latin funk backdrop at the takedown scene at the end (thank God for that)...then you have the disco era in ""Private Dancer"" ""Disco Inferno"" and the softer side of that era (away from the city lights) in Trilogy Part III (set in 1978).  If there was some sort of revival written and produced by the same people..I could only imagine what justice they would have given the 80's and 90's as opposed to the crap ""Cold Case"" puts out..though I love lily rush and the show is poignant it needs to do its homework in terms of portraying an era...making every 50's episode in black & white like it was ancient?  Come on.  Quantum Leap YOU ROCK MY WORLD!  Please bring it back, someone!!  And don't mangle a great season finale show by throwing in filler music....do you realize how touching that final scene was....I used to suffocate when ""georgia on my mind"" came on the radio as a kid....after that show I never looked at that song the same way again....greediness left unchecked.",1241568000,2,2031,4.818965517241379
1475197,4,B00005JM3A,"This is a really awesome show about a scientist named Dr. Sam Beckett who proves that time travel theory works by leaping into different people at different times within his lifetime. Sam receives help from a man named Al, who appears as a hologram that only Sam can see. I love when they show the 50's because I love the look, the style, the cars, and the music of the 50's! Throughout this season, Sam becomes a pilot of the experimental Bell X-2 aircraft, a baseball player, a college professor, a crooked boxer, a black man in the south, and more! I highly recommend QUANTUM LEAP: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON!!!",1239494400,,613,4.581818181818182

1475470,5,B00005JM3A,"Some time around 1996, genius physicist Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula), fearing that the Federal government will cut off funding to the time-travel project he's been working on, steps into the accelerator and sets out on the wildest journey in the history of humanity.  He wakes up in the body of a USAF test pilot--in 1956--with his memory of his own identity and past ""Swiss-cheesed"" and no idea of how he got there.  Fortunately, he has backup--the wise-cracking, cigar-smoking, skirt-chasing, very fashion-forward ex-astronaut Al (Dean Stockwell), who appears as a hologram whom only Sam can see and hear.  Back at the Project, Ziggy, the parallel hybrid computer Sam designed and programmed, has decided that in order to ""leap out"" of his current body and time, Sam must fly Mach 3 and survive.  As it turns out, though, it's not just his host's life he has to save.  In successive leaps he ""becomes"" a minor-league baseball player in 1968 Waco, an English-lit prof at an Ohio college in 1957 (where he meets his own future fiancee), a heavyweight boxer in 1974 California, a veterinarian in rural Texas in 1956, a Mafia hit man in 1965 Brooklyn, a black man in 1955 Alabama, a 17-year-old hot rodder in 1961 Southern California, and a middle-aged PI in 1953 New York.  Each time he must ""put right what once went wrong"" in the life of his host or someone close to him, with only Al (and his handheld link to Ziggy) to provide him with clues.  Along the way he also enables the discovery of the Watergate break-in, launches a young Buddy Holly, unwittingly causes the Great Northeast Blackout, teaches a very young Michael Jackson to moonwalk, and encounters a teenage Woody Allen.  Besides the very evident chemistry between Bakula and Stockwell, among the best features of the nine episodes in this abbreviated maiden season is the way cars, clothes, props, and music are used to give the feel of the various years Sam visits--including, in the closer (""Play It Again, Seymour""), a wonderful five-storey brick building with cast-iron balconies all around a skylighted courtyard and a lacy grilled elevator.  And as time passes, Sam gradually begins to get bits and pieces of his memory back, so that we learn something of who he is and what brought him to this fate.  Each episode is prefaced by a brief introduction by Bakula telling something about the segment and the incidents of its filming.",1457913600,,2399,4.857843137254902

1475475,5,B00005JM3A,"All these Quantum Leap season sets are bargain prices for a series that had consistent high quality episodes from beginning to end. The stories alternate drama, action, comedy, and intense character study as Sam Beckett pops from one person to another as he attempts to solve the mysteries that will end his journey into the past and allow him to return to himself.

Back in those days, with no DVRs and limited ability to program VCRs, we always missed some episodes of even our favorite shows. This gives us a chance to ""fill in the blanks"" at a very reasonable price.

For example, we never saw the first shows of this series. I don't think we even discovered it until sometime into the second season. It's always fun to go back and see ""first episodes"", and especially so if you didn't see them in the first place!

Highly recommended",1453593600,,838,4.610738255033557

I watched most of season 1 and I'm sorry I bought the first two seasons of the show. Now the seasons are here at the house taking up valuable shelf space.

That this series does this cavalierly as the way in which each time jump is concluded makes me think that the writers did not think this through very well.  I also find it interesting that he never leaps forward in time only back.  I understand that the ""time space continuum"" theory is not universal among sci-fi programs but the logic of it is clear.

Scott Bakula is awesome as Sam Beckett, the time traveling hero. What I love most is that the scenario changes with every episode.

To watch this show about my life. Well not the Leaping but the 'Sam' character. I too am a multi degree geek. Medicine Languages and a phd student of....Yes Quantum Physics! My idea of fun is learning a new language or studying theoretical physics or anything to do with numbers. I couldn't do much of anything until i found this gem. It reminded me that this is just one state i am in at the moment and like electrons it can and will change at will. Any Hoo ....This show is so entertaining. I love Al!!!!!! He is a trip. I haven't laughed so much while ill in a long time. I will spare the ""Quantum"" references. The duo rocks!!!!! The leaps he makes are so different and exciting to look forward to the next show.(since they send him there right before the credits roll) We hear an"" Oh Boy"" Which is Sam in a new ""state"" or body and its not looking to good.... Love that. So the next show is on ASAP!!!! There are so many scientific references one could make but one won't. LOL. Two days and almost finished so sad:( with the series. I am recuperating nicely and found a cool show. I am not religious but the show went that way with the 'Leaps'. Its like Einstien he knew in his heart as well as mind that Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind! He was a bit shall we say creeped no spooked out over the ways of the quantum world. The quantum world and it's possibilities and the quest to find a Theory of Everything.(is my ""religion"")  What i am trying to get to is"" he wanted to read the mind of God."" I want to know what the Universe(s) is trying to tell me. Quantum Leap does the former rather than the latter. I just go with the flow of the show. Awesome!",1382745600,,1914,4.159029649595688

Stories are lightweight but make good use of the difference in time between the now of the series (already beginning to fade into the ""past"") and the past. The humor is not hilarious but smile level; it works to keep the show from appearing too serious. The stories do often have that bit of mildly serious sentiment to give it ""heart"" but usually not intrusive or too 'gooey'. Best of all are the two stars: Scott Bakula, as the hero and victim of the erratic plunges into unplanned time periods for which he is quite unfitted, is appealing if sometime overly gawky (a role characteristic not his acting). Dean Stockwell is a thoroughgoing professional who makes the most of his essentially comedic role. The stories, as is to be expected, vary in quality, but overall keep you coming back for more. A nice if not overly substantial show.",1381363200,,920,4.685185185185185

Then I received the second season. Very disappointed. Yes, the shows are intact, cheesy effects and all, but there are no bonuses (EVEN THOUGH THE BOX STATES THERE IS!), no episode insights, nothing.

Well this show is the perfect escape into the past when shows like these were around offering a relaxed, positive and entertaining shift. Only down side is the quality of dvd transfer isn't at its highest on this one. The positive is that you get more episodes on the dvd set that you don,t get to see on Net Flix!

We missed the experiment that sent him quantum leaping.  They only talk about the computer that figures out future possible time lines for them and the other scientist.  We should have met them before we talked about them for the rest of the series.  But it's a fun concept and there's silliness and endearing moments.,1366588800,,467,4.511904761904762

Okay, its a bit dated, but its cute and harmless fun, moving from one ""period skit"" to another.  It ties together comedy, ""fast and loose"" sci-fi and social commentary - the same formula used by Star Trek.

1478791,4,B00005JM3A,Most of the technology is hidden in this SciFi series.  The neat thing is that each show is independant and is like a brand new story line.  Clever to be able to do that.  This is the only scifi show I have ever seen that keeps God in thepicture.  Sometimes the show gets a bit strange with him living out a woman's life.

It seemed like it was longer than two seasons, but that's all I found. If there are more, I hope they come available. I haven't got to the last one in season 2. I will know if it is the final episode, when he finds who has been leaping him around.

After reading about the boxed sets. I learned there are more seasons. I also learned I'm grateful I didn't buy the set without the original scores, but instead I have watched it on Instant Video with all the music intact.

1478849,3,B00005JM3A,"Not as many episodes for your money in the first season.  And all the extras on the DVDs are pretty silly to me.  While I am a Scott Bakula fan, he's loosing esteem in my book because of all the silly things he says in the interviews before each episode.  It really takes the punch out of the  episode itself & it makes him look like an arrogant light-weight - sorry to say it, Scott!  Also, the written description of each episode is redundant and something I don't want to see before watching it.  It gives everything away.  So my recommendation is:  JUST WATCH THE EPISODES AND SKIP ALL THAT OTHER ROT.  If you're a Quantum Leap fan, of course, you have to start at the beginning, so this is where it all begins.  I do like, however that theme of ""Sam"" wanting to reconnect with his father and the ""Going Home"" theme song goes through the entire series.",1358467200,3,856,4.327044025157233

1478856,5,B00005JM3A,"""Quantum Leap"" the complete first season was produced in 1989, when I was just ten years old. It took at least a year to be featured on Australian television though, but watching it now takes me back to a dreamy and adventurous time in my life.

I remember seeing parts of the first season, but all these years later I have finally watched all the episodes from the first year. In some ways it has worked out better because many historic facets woven into the narrative, and plenty of humour, makes more sense now.

The brilliance of the Quantum Leap story concept hasn't been lost during the decades following the first season as it is wonderful to watch, and can take a viewer to a place where changing the past is reality.

1478980,5,B00005JM3A,"The second season of Quantum Leap was the shows first full season and took full advantage of that. There are enough episodes during this season to allow for a much more diverse array of leaps. One of my favorites this season is the episode ""Jimmy"" where Sam leaps into the body of a mentally retarted young adult whose about to join the work force during a time when such individuals were being institutionalized. This creates a conflict of interest for Al,whose already hard life was compounded by the fact his retarted sister never got the chance to have the wrong done to her put right (whatch the episode:you'll find out what I mean). This season also begins another running Quantum Leap of Scott Bakula's Sam Beckett leaping into women. The first such episode is the excellent sexual harrassment message ""What Price Gloria?"" where Sam leaps into a beautiful female secretary who not only is destined to help his despondant roommate but also finds the testosterone built Bakula whering everything from lipstick,high heels,pill box hats and face veils. It makes for some non offensive burlesque comedy (never aimed at making fun of transsexuals for the PC crowd) and provides one of the great ""put yourself in their shoes"" moments that were such an important part of this show. Another great episode here that deals with a very controversial type of prejiduce is ""The Americanization of Machiko"" wherin Sam leaps into a GI returning from Korea with a native bride who becomes entangled in the heavy Asian prejiduce among many Americans following WWII. Of course many of these episodes are actually amusing adventures such as the theater send up ""Catch A Falling Star"",actually co-staring two future&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Northern-Exposure/dp/B000V6LSO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Northern Exposure</a>&nbsp;aluni John Cullum and Janine Turner in nice,meaty roles.  Along the way Sam also leaps into a young Native American,a rabbi,a trapese artist and of course an Alen Freed like DJ in ""Good Morning Peoria"",a generally comic style episode that even still has an important message about censorship. Sometimes a fun story actually has a way of delivering an important message without being too preachy and this one does. A very rewarding season for this show,not the mention the one that put it on the map to most people and a potent reminder of why people such as myself like the show so much in the first place.",1279497600,4,2469,5.250632911392405
1478981,5,B00005JM3A,"Honestly this has to be one of the most unique shows after to be a hit on American TV. The theme tells it all: a guy named Sam Beckett is leaping into different people during his lifetime by an unknown force and driven to change history for the better with his only guide being a lusty hologram of his frient and colleague Al who only Sam can see and hear. So he keeps going hoping his next leap will be the leap home. Well here we start the adventures of Sam Beckett:Indiana farm boy,MIT graduate and general wunderkind with a swiss cheesed memory. Every week the man is literally someone else. First he's an airforce pilot,than a baseball player-all in the same episode. Before you know it he's a disipated English lit professor destined to avoid the charms of a festishist more or less. Since Quantum Leap was such an enlightened and progressive show there are episodes even this early in the game such as ""The Color Of Truth"" in which Sam,a white man (my man Scott Bakula) leaps into a black chauffer in the mid 50's south in a very&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Driving-Miss-Daisy/dp/B002VWNIBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Driving Miss Daisy</a>&nbsp;style sendup. The great part of that is how Al,himself a huge participant in the civil rights movement helps Sam to step into the shoes of a black man in that place and time. It's episodes like this that offer an atypical ""put yourself in their shoes"" scenrio. Also the episode showcases that often ignored fact about African Americans-the fact they're as willing,if sometimes not more so than others, a helping hand to those they call friend. A great message for those with strong misconceptions of black people especially in the late 80's/early 90's. This DVD is only eight episodes long and as with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Northern-Exposure/dp/B000V6LSO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Northern Exposure</a>&nbsp;much of the original music used has been replaced. But it's great to see all the episodes of one of a handfull of TV series I really genuinely loved and anyone who never saw this before should rent it. If they do they'll get caught up in these great stories,great messages and great characters of one of the most unique sci fi shows ever.",1279411200,2,2301,5.2896174863387975
1478982,4,B00005JM3A,"There's not much bad to say about this season one disk set.  It's unfortunate that season one was a short 8-episode season, but that's not the fault of the people who put this disk collection together.  The only other problem I had was that when they try to cram as many episodes as possible on as few disks as possible, my dvd player doesn't always read them perfectly.  There are occassional skips or parts where the action stops for about 30 seconds before resuming.  This doesn't happen with other DVDs I own, so I am lead to believe it's due to so much info placed onto each disk.
I've read some reviews that complained about them removing some of the original songs from certain episodes.  I didn't actually take note of that, probably because I wasn't aware of what the original songs were that were playing in the background on the jukebox in this or that episode.  To a die-hard fan who knows these bits of info, I can understand how that is kind of a cheap thing for the producers of this disk set to do.
Overall I still think it's a worthwhile buy for any fan of the show.  The vast majority of the time on the disks plays well, looks good, sounds good, and even has a short preview by Scott Bakula before each episode.  Despite some imperfections, I'm happy with this DVD set.",1273449600,,1288,4.405063291139241

If you've never seen Quantum Leap, and I can't see how that's possible, please do yourself a favor and treat yourself to it. Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell were excellent week to week and superbly backed up by fine writers and director. Some of the shows even had the fine added talents of Kevin Corcoran as first assistant director. You might remember him as a rambunctious child actor for Walt Disney Studios in the 1950s and 60s.

One thing was certain about Quantum Leap: You never knew from one week to the next what was going to happen to Scott Bakula's character, Sam Beckett, but you could rest assured that it would be exciting and well worth watching entertainment. As a writer of science fiction and horror I have been reading and watching the stuff for over 50 years and put this series on my personal top shelf along with The Time Machine and War of the Worlds.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Winds-of-Hell/dp/B0032Y20IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Winds of Hell</a>",1261785600,,1144,5.117647058823529

The only problem I have with Quantum Leap on DVD is that some of the episodes are mixed up.  Some of what was originally in the first season ended up on the second season dvd and vice versa.  Sam would leap into a Mom on one of the episodes, but then when you select the next episode to be viewed, it would be a different season.
