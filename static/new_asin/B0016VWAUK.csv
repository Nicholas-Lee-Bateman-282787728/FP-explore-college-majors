This DVD is the ""bible"" on Garifuna Drum beats and how to play them.
The best kept secret about this DVD is it's bonus music video tracks featuring the Garifuna Collective with Andy Palacio and Paul Nabor.

During the development of the project, the Chicago Parks Department music program utilized intermediate drafts for drumming instruction with great success, and the earlier versions were also used in various college and university-level Caribbean Studies workshops. ""For all drummers and enthusiasts of Afro-Latin music, this DVD is a must own,"" said Aaron Cohen, associate editor of Downbeat Magazine.

The DVD consists of 100 minutes of training and musical video in a six panel photographic digipak. Also included are two songs by the traditional acoustic Garifuna band Wamalali, and two songs by Paul Nabor/Andy Palacio and the Garifuna Collective recorded at Chicago's Millennium Park, as well as a collaborative & contemporary world music single Nanigi .",1210723200,4,1008,5.448717948717949
8264209,5,B0016VWAUK,This video is great for anyone who is interested in learning how to play the Garifuna rhythms. It's especially wonderful for those Garifunas who are not fortunate to be near other Garifunas but are still interested in passing down aspects of their culture to their children. This video enables me to teach my son how to play the drums even though it is not a skill of mine. I am very grateful this video was produced and is available in such an accessible market.,1210032000,2,463,4.523809523809524
