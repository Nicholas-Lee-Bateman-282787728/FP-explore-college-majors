1929814,5,B0000DZTWH,"I bought this movie because I had seen it at a film festival in Los Angeles and I loved it.  Seeing it again, I swear the movie gets weirder and weirder.  The style and pace is strangely hypnotic and watching the movie is like being a little kid again only experiencing childhood through an adult's eyes.  It's not a perfect movie on the surface, but it holds up very well and really does grow on you.  Clearly, this was the intent of the filmmakers, and I think they did a very good job messing with my head!  Excellent soundtrack and the performances seem off in the beginning but as you watch it, you realize how good and consistent everyone is.  Highly recommended.",1099872000,3,669,4.442622950819672
1929815,5,B0000DZTWH,"I was comlpetely blown away by this movie after having stumbled upon it by accident.  This is not the Johnny Depp movie about J.M. Barrie, and it is not a big-budget Hollywood movie, but it is an amazing, strangely sexy/beautiful, incredibly insightful take on PETER PAN.  If you are a PETER PAN fan, if you are interested in modern, edgy interpretations of classics like Baz Luhrman's ROMEO AND JULIET, or if you are into extremely cool and stylish indie cinema, this film is a must have for your collection.  Tiger Lily's musical number and Tinkerbell were fantastic!",1099872000,5,569,4.845360824742268
1929816,5,B0000DZTWH,"This movie is not what you expect and everything you expect.  I thought it would be a twist on the Peter Pan story and it was, but the way it was twisted was very good and surprising.  It's amazing how little was changed from the original yet it managed to be so different.  The style of the movie is fascinating, and it is truly impressive how it was adapted so ingeniously.",1087344000,5,375,4.253521126760563
1929817,1,B0000DZTWH,"i bought this movie expecting something in the like of baz luhraman's pecies.  i didn't get anything close to any of his work, what i got was a crappy remake of peter pan. bad camera angles, lifeless characters, horrbile directing.  this movie has to be one of the worst dvd's of my dvd collection.",1084665600,4,298,4.5
1929818,4,B0000DZTWH,"The movie Neverland really amazed me. Beautifully directed. Incredible symbolism, especially in costuming and settings. I was so impressed with the script (stayed very true to the novel), the metaphorical genius employed, and the talented cast members. This film really stands out among other low-budget films. There were a few downfalls to it, as with any movie. At times the acting seemed a bit forced, there were choppy scenes, and lengthy drug induced color and light schemes momentarily detract attention from the point of the movie.  On the whole, I thought the movie was incredible and the talent of those involved really speaks for itself. I absolutely recommend this movie, especially to those familiar with the original story of Peter Pan. It's dark and original, and manages a whole new take on the well-known classic while staying true to the story JM Barrie wanted to tell.",1073606400,7,886,5.068493150684931
1929819,4,B0000DZTWH,"Interesting twist...thought movie would be another ""me too"" movie.  Loved the character twist.  Something more realistic and less fantacy but still has a sci fi feeling/drama feeling...actors were well chosen...Loved pixie!  The main character had a new look, different style, loved it.  Perfect for film students who want to study how the pro's do it.",1071705600,4,352,5.345454545454546
1929820,5,B0000DZTWH,"I think Rick Sparks done a fantastic job playing his part.he is quite handsome and has a nice body. I hope to see him in more movies. a new fresh face and character. I could be a little prejudice though his mom is my cousin and so is he,but I really do think he is a good actor and will go along way.",1067731200,,300,3.7777777777777777
8001489,5,B0000DZTWH,"I love it! It's a wonderfully dark film. It got to me safely. Fast shipping. I watched this film once over 8 years ago and have been looking for it ever since. I checked everywhere, The library, walmart, etc... and couldn't find it. So I'm very happy to find it and at such a great price. Happy with my order Thank you  :  )",1396051200,,324,4.046875
8001490,1,B0000DZTWH,This movie was terrible.  I quit watching after a half hour.  The only reason I gave it one star is that it wouldn't let me leave no stars!,1328659200,,139,3.9285714285714284
8001491,5,B0000DZTWH,"This is by far one of the most remarkable renditions of the traditional story of Peter Pan anyone could ever fathom, and it was done extremely well, despite the obviousness that it was shot on a very low budget. Contrary to what it may appear, this film is not set on a dirty or distasteful tone, and it leaves out judgment against the rights and wrongs of the world, instead focusing upon loss of innocence and rebellion on a more metaphorical level. I would recommend this movie for its modern storytelling of patterns, behaviors and conclusions that the characters each learn for different reasons and in different ways, as is the way of the real world. Growing up is hard to do, but placing the background of Neverland and its eternal anthem, ""Never grow up, never grow old,"" into the mix creates an exceptional story and an amazing relation between the viewer and characters. Some cast members include Mr. Wheaton from the film Stand By Me, and Mr. Mechlowicz of the film Mean Creek showing his promising acting skills as Schmee.",1249430400,,1034,4.718232044198895
8001492,3,B0000DZTWH,"""Neverland"" is the Peter Pan story reset to slacker characters.  The three adopted Darling children, John (a 23-year old dropout, played by Wil Wheaton), Michael (a similar-aged Ritalin taker, played by Marcus Reynaga), and Wendy (the designated responsible babysitter, played by Melany Bell) all want to escape their home.  Peter Pan (Rick Sparks) shows up looking for the keys to his car (""My Shadow"") and entices Wendy and her adoptive brothers to run away to Neverland, an amusement park maintained by head janitor Hook (Gary Kelley).  Tinkerbell (Kari Wahlgren) takes an instant dislike of Wendy.  We meet the Lost Boys, a drag queen Tiger Lily (Ray Garcia), American Indian performers, and other varients of the Barrie story.  Hook says he wants to rid Neverland of Lost Boy lowlives but indicates he uses the boys for his own purposes. The story proceeds.

Skin shots are provided by Michael, Hook, and two of the Lost Boys.  There is no sex or violence.  For all of its edgy look, the basic story is very evident throughout.

The acting was fair.  For whatever reason I liked Rick Sparks as Peter, Melany Bell as Wendy, and Ryan Patrick Kelly as Tootles, a Lost Boy.  The lighting and sets were interesting.

The drawbacks for me were the mixed messages in the film.

Wendy's moralizing and second thoughts come almost as soon as she reaches Neverland; there is no honeymoon period.  Characters in their mid-20s are lectured to both get a career and live at home with their parents.  Disney's Peter Pan and Pinocchio deliver similar, simpler messages.  Here, Ikiru meets The Wizard of Oz.

The film has been marketed to an extent as a gay film because of the Hook's stated tendencies and S&M costuming.  But for me the film's implicit message is that if you leave the safety of home, you will be attacked by perverts.  Although Peter claims to be ""pansexual"", there are no positive gay characters in the film.  Pan dispatches Hook, and nobody cares.  This is not a gay film.

It is an interesting variant of the Peter Pan story and has more point for older viewers wondering if they have been enticed to their own Neverlands.",1115683200,14,2133,4.786301369863014
8001493,5,B0000DZTWH,"This movie has the most beautiful ensemble cast I've ever seen. There is something for everyone here.  This is an intellectual spin on a classic fairy tale, but it is extremely sensual as well.  A MUST for any indie film collector or those who are fans of explicitly gay-themed movies.",1113868800,6,285,4.68
8001494,5,B0000DZTWH,Saw it in a film festival. Loved it had to have the DVD. The lead (Rick Sparks)is excellent and Dietz is an up and coming director.,1104105600,3,131,4.076923076923077
8001495,5,B0000DZTWH,This movie is by far the best version of Peter Pan that has ever been made. The story has been told over and over again but never with this originality or style. This movie was sick. I rented this movie to watch with my girlfriend and her little brother but we had to send the little brother out of the room to play with his Playstation. Making Tinkerbell a Gwen Stefani/hoochie/fairy dust dealer was genius and the Tiger Lily song was unbelievable. We were on the floor amazed by this movie. We still quote it.,1100563200,6,511,4.389473684210526
8001496,5,B0000DZTWH,"Wendy: Peter, are you [...]? Peter: Hell no! I'm [...].

At that point I was freaking out! I knew from the start that it was a low budget film, but it sparked my interest about Peter Pan and it brought the story up to date; it makes it almost more believable.

A lot a freaky turns, like Hook's a janitor at an amusement park called Neverland? And he's into doing kinky things with his ""Hook"" and the bad ""lost"" boys.

OK its hard to explain I guess, but you do get everything that you except and a bit more.

SO if you are a big Peter Pan fan like myself and my crazy friends, you will enjoy it. It's definitely not a film for everyone.

Do you believe in fairies?",1100044800,6,665,4.084615384615384

8001498,5,B0000DZTWH,"I liked the style of this movie a lot.  It reminded me of David Lynch and Baz Luhrmann.  I was surprised by how emotionally effective the movie was.  I didn't think there was much to the Peter Pan story except ""you can fly!"", but this movie made me look at it from a different point of view.  Wendy was a little annoying but I think that was the point.  Peter and the boys were HOT HOT HOT and Tinkerbell was hilarious and heartbreaking.",1099872000,5,437,4.216867469879518
