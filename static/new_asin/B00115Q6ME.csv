3060570,5,B00115Q6ME,"The Undertaking provides a powerful and moving view of the process of sickness, death, funeral preparations and burial. It tells the story of what we usually don't like to think about, but for one family is a lifestyle (preparing and presenting the recently departed). Definitely worth watching.",1281484800,6,295,5.297872340425532
3060571,5,B00115Q6ME,"I used this DVD as part of the educational program at a hospital's pastoral care department.  Students, staff, and volunteers are uniformly touched by its realism and sensitivity.  It provokes thoughtful discussion.",1217635200,7,215,5.6875
3060572,5,B00115Q6ME,"I saw part of this program when it aired on PBS. I wanted to see the entire program and ordered this DVD. I have since shown it to all my family and several close friends. All have reacted the same way... grateful they saw the process of working with the grieving as they go on after the death of a loved one. None of us gets out of this life alive, yet little is said or done to explain the final process of life. This program paints a picture of sensitive, caring funeral personnel, as well as a glimpse into family situations death can bring about. Choices of cremation or burial are better understood. Pre-planning to save the family from choices in their grief is also represented. I feel a richer person, in spirit, for having heard the poetry of Thomas Lynch that is peppered into this must-see program. Thanks to all who worked to produce it.",1207872000,17,850,4.420382165605096

8240614,5,B00115Q6ME,"As a future skeleton, you would do well to watch this.  It's very easy to follow and very respective and thoughtful.  Obviously, death can be a disturbing topic, as can the sights and sounds of preparing for wakes, funerals etc.  But the interviews are very focused and helpful to all of us.  Totally worth the one or so hour it took to watch it!",1503878400,,346,4.359375
8240615,4,B00115Q6ME,"Profiles a family that provides services for a town when people pass away. At times heartbreaking as it shares the pre-preparation by family members for the passing of their loved ones, one of which is a sick child. Shares the final preparations, at times not easy to watch, insightful.",1480118400,,286,4.857142857142857

8240618,4,B00115Q6ME,"Not something we like to think about, nor is it a good idea to dwell on, eitherbut guess what? It happens to every one of us. We all get deep sixed eventually.

Yes, we know and like all those horror flicks about the one-eyed, murderous undertaker in flicks like Fantasm (I know: that particular undertaker happens to be very tall, but does have both eyes) and others. They're fun to watch, no doubt. Thing is, scare flicks are made to entertain you, which is fine...what you get here is the real thing, the way it goes, what actually happens behind the scenes when you kick off.
I say take a look; not for any morbid reason, but as a way of dealing with and accepting the whole thing, including the fact you're mortal and everyone's time is fleeting.",1387929600,2,751,4.442028985507246
8240619,4,B00115Q6ME,"""The Undertaking"" is a Frontline documentary inspired by poet/undertaker Thomas Lynch's book of the same name.  It is a gentle look at the rites and rituals of death in America.  Lynch is a thoughtful man who's poetic bent comes through in his observations about his family's three generation commitment to giving the dead, and the living, the respect they deserve at the end of life.",1382140800,2,384,4.892307692307693
8240620,4,B00115Q6ME,I have wanted to own this since its first broadcast on PBS. It's packed with information that makes planning easier. I'm glad I bought it.,1358380800,2,138,4.56
8240621,5,B00115Q6ME,"Extremely well edited, beautiful, dignified, poetic, never morbid or gross, interesting, heart breaking at times but we all must confront death. Can't imagine a more lovely way to honor those who have passed and those who grieve for them.",1347062400,2,238,5.128205128205129

8240623,5,B00115Q6ME,"I originally saw this on PBS a few years ago and ordered this dvd to see the entire doc. Like most people, when it comes to pondering death in relation to family, friends, and myself, I go into ocelot mode.
What makes this documentary good is that it presents the subject of death and dying with a lot of sensitivity while addressing a lot of the issues associated with grief as well as the funeral and burial process. There are numerous options available to families, but I doubt that many people give this adequate consideration until someone dies. It impressed upon me how important it is to be well-informed and to also make one's wishes known to the family before death visits.
The bottom line is this is an interesting and informative look at the funeral industry that approaches the subject of death with a lot of caring while also addressing practical issues. It also doesn't sensationialize death.",1295308800,2,906,4.7405063291139244
