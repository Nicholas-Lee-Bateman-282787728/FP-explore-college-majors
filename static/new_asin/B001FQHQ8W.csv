8302348,4,B001FQHQ8W,"I viewed Pururambo multiple time on Netflix and just purchased a copy for myself from Amazon. I find it a fascinating watch. While the movie itself is a record of an extreme traveler/ thrill seeker's time in the uncharted rain forests of New Guinea it is far more. Pururambo opened my ""civilized"" western eyes to life in the stone age.

Pururambo is not an anthropological study but it is a visual record of peoples whose lives are without the benefit of iron/ bronze/ or pottery. The wheel hasn't been invented. There are no school, no churches, no medicines or doctors. Life is a continue search for foods. The aim is survival and continuation of the extended family group.

I ofttimes wondered about the reality of the ancient records of our race (homo sapiens sapiens) who existed so long ago in what is called the ""stone age."" Here I saw with my own eyes such peoples, insulated from the march of civilization for hundreds even thousands of years.

The flow of the movie at the beginning and at the end is hard to fully understand. But Pururambo is a rare treasure indeed. This presentation of these stone age people's essential humanity and look into their daily lives is something for which I am thankful.

8302349,2,B001FQHQ8W,"Why does National Geographic, the History Channel, and Discovery continue to only use/allow journalists to explore and narrate these type of documentaries beats me.  These networks are supposed to be managed by Westerners and 'civilized' educated people who have NO UNDERSTANDING of what Natives/Indigenous worlds really have been, are and will be.  WHY WHY WHY are anthropologists not invited to do these type of documentaries?  Why don't these networks rely on the true understandings that the anthropology discipline could bring?  BECAUSE THEY WANT TO CONTINUE LYING TO THE VIEWERS and they want to continue the portrayal of a perfect Western civilized world making the 'other' seen as non-civilized, savage, or naive.  PLEASE, IF NOT MADE WITHIN AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE, IT IS WORTH 0.  Hire the correct discipline to instruct us and not journalists with fantasy lala land ideologies.",1394928000,3,895,5.449275362318841
8302350,4,B001FQHQ8W,"I watched this on Netflix recently.  I recommend it but it is also disturbed me in a lot of ways. It was fascinating how they actually got through the jungle where there are no paths and so many dangers, and fascinating to learn about the tribal people's beliefs and culture. On the other hand, I felt disturbed the the filmmakers approach; his interactions with people, and his rather facile summary of the people he met as ""pururambo"" (good). They are headhunters, so, maybe we can find a way to think about them that is more complex? They aren't just there to help the filmmaker see the world more spiritually. And while their approach to life may make him feel good during a brief visit, if he were to be there during an actual act of cannibalism would he still think they were ""good.""

The people in these tribes live in a way that is unimaginable to Western people: focused obsessively on gathering food, so little possessions and tools,  lives intertwined with magic and superstition. It is interesting - incredible - to see how they live, eat, survive. I recommend watching it, but it's hard to shake off how he went about getting the footage, and I had a lot of questions about what was happening when the camera was off.",1383609600,2,1230,4.581818181818182
8302351,1,B001FQHQ8W,"This is a poorly done, biased documentary. The movie shows the culture and lives of peoples in the interior of New Guinea which is very interesting but there is no ending. Something about their visit disturbs a tribe they had visited and they are forced to leave but you are left with the question ""What happened?"" which never gets answered and the director refuses to provide information on this. He somehow blames everything on missionaries but doesn't show how their influence caused any of their problems.  These are people controlled by superstitions and not open to outsiders.  They blame bad events on visits from foreigners.  The missionaries didn't cause this, it is part of their culture. He fails to see the many good things missionaries have done for the country and his whole trip is possible because many tribal people have slowly stopped their killing of outsiders (because of all things they have been taught it is wrong) and in many tribes the fear of evil spirits is no longer there.  If it weren't for many of the missionaries there he wouldn't have gotten very far from the coast.  This is not to say that the missionaries are perfect but he lets his negative view affect his judgement.  While the video is interesting it provides no hope for the native peoples.",1380585600,,1282,4.778280542986425

8302353,5,B001FQHQ8W,This documentary was really interesting and well narrated. Great example of how anthropology can be used to study indigenous tribes without being overly invasive or disruptive- takes an objective view of situations that would disturb most people.,1346457600,4,246,5.675675675675675
8302354,5,B001FQHQ8W,"This travel video takes you INSIDE the lives of jungle tribes (head hunters) along with the explorer. YOU ARE THERE! These people have never seen a white person. These people live in tree houses in the jungle, still use CAVE MAN tools. My mouth was open during the entire film, meaning it's really shocking to witness what this explorer went through to get this footage and learn about these hidden tribes in New Guinea. In fact, these people don't even know about any other people in New Guinea or elsewhere. They thought this guy was an evil white spirit and he came close to losing his life on several occasions. Why is this important enough for me to buy to have in my collection, is that in realizing how these people live, I learn how little is really needed to live a happy life, and yet, how lucky I am, as a woman especially, to be worth more than a few pigs. Additionally, I learned that these people have no time to feel sorry for their situations, no time for depression, no time to consider suicide because of some emotionally depressing realizations, that can feel so crushing. THIS MOVIE IS A DEPRESSION STOPPER! I can be here in my little cabin surrounded by all my books and movies and warmth and conveniences, or I can be naked in the jungle squatting by a river or pounding a tree into mush for food. Somehow in witnessing these VERY INTERESTING lives, my attitude is so much better, just a change in attitude can make such a difference. And when it falters and I backslide into my little pity party, I will stick this movie in the player and remind myself of the alternatives. Yes, this movie can be viewed on Netflix, but I want to have it at hand, perhaps to show to others who don't know enough to count their blessings, focus on the many gifts of the western lifestyle, and yet are far too materialistic. We can live with less. We can re-balance our overly materialistic lives and find more pleasure, more time to ENJOY life, more time to create in our little stations of bliss. I truly want to thank this explorer for taking me to the back jungles of New Guinea, a place on my bucket list (I'll likely end up visiting only places tourists go, but I would love to be brave enough to visit these interesting people, although I believe we should leave them to live their lives as they wish, not try to convert them to western ways of thought or someone else s religious ideas. They have lived like this for thousands of years without our ""help"" and ""intrusion"". Yes, I am happy to know them through this film and I support their right to live as their ancestors lived, in their tree houses, eating bugs and snakes and termites. It is THEIR right to live as they wish. And, I'm happy to know they are, that us ""western white folks"" have left something in this world untouched, un-invaded, un-missionaried. I hope we have enough conscious to leave them alone. Buy this video and support this fantastic explorer. In fact, I am buying all his videos that are currently available! I want him to know he has my support. I am also an avid 3rd world traveler, but not one with his sense of fearlessness. I salute him!",1325462400,6,3131,4.456445993031359
