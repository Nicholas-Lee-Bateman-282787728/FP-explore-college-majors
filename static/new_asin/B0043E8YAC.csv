4255598,5,B0043E8YAC,"I am not giving this 5 stars solely based on it being Dio and his untimely passing earlier this year...I am giving this 5 star b/c the band were firing on ALL cylinders this night, and Dio, who sounded a bit hoarse the first few numbers, was in all his singing glory til the end of Neon Nights!  Iommi, Butler, and Vin are a powerhouse band...easily one of heavy metal elite band line-ups...and Dio is still the master of the stage, his presence is as dominating as ever...the sound and camera work are both excellent and professional...no edit gimmickry, or overdubs. Just a full kick ass show from the 4 old Sabs and their new material, especially Bible Black ranks right up there with Heaven and Hell...a grand show on it's own merit...God Rest you Ronnie James Dio, and as you sang, the ending is (truly) just the beginning.

Added remarks...as for the interviews in the bonus sections...the tribute interviews are really lame...it appears Tony's is cut off, Vinny says a few words, and Geezer's is genuine.  Doesn't look like these tribute interviews were done specifically for this release.",1290816000,,1096,4.788359788359788
4255599,5,B0043E8YAC,"I just received this video in the mail this morning along with the CD and I have it on now as I write this. All I can say is WOW! I have had the pleasure of seeing these guys twice since they reunited and they are just as powerful and amazing as they were in the early 80's, if not more so. Dio is by far my favorite performer and Sabbath one of my favorite bands, so the two together just seems to be a match made in Heaven... or in Hell. This DVD really showcases what they are capable of and includes some absolutely excellent performances. All of the gents are in full form and are really into it. Dio sings with the power and passion that no other can and moves around the stage as if he was 20 years younger. Tony tears it up, Vinnie's solo is awesome, and Geezer's bass is thunderous. Every song is better than the one before it. The crowd is loud and really into it, and the band feed off the energy and smile the whole time. I actually enjoy this more than the Radio City DVD, the only downside is that this set is not as long, but the performances more than make up for this. The inclusion of the Devil You Know tracks as well as Time Machine really make this one unique and gives some variation making this quite a welcome addition to the collection. Both video and audio quality are top notch and you will find yourself crankin' this one up nice and loud. As sad as it is to know that Dio has passed on and that this band will be no more, this very special performance brings back all the wonderful memories of that great man and this great band and although he might be gone, the music lives on. Long live rock & Roll, Ling Live DIO, and Long live Sabbath!!!",1290211200,21,1671,4.128834355828221
4255600,5,B0043E8YAC,"This is a fantasic, aggressive final performance from Heaven and Hell. With 3 tracks from '09's ""The Devil You Know"" and the first live recording of ""Time Machine,"" that alone makes ""Neon Nights: Live in Europe"" worth the price.  But the performances of the band is fantastic, and among their heaviest sounding. Dio's vocals are more aggressive and rough in spots - this performance was late in the '09 tour - but still maintain all of his might.  Actually, the snarls make for interesting takes at times.  Iommi's guitar is huge and Butler's bass is thunderous.  Appice does a quick drum solo that rocks.  The bonus interviews recorded before Dio's passing find the band being candid about their two previous break-ups and how their releationship went from business in the early 80s to complete friendship when they reunited in '07.  The tribute to Dio from the surviving members are also touching.  If you loved the more intimate ""Live from Radio City,"" ""Live in Europe"" is a perfect companion piece and an excellent stand alone live DVD.",1290124800,20,1040,4.875
4255601,5,B0043E8YAC,"Although it's been said many times, it bears being repeated once more considering the events of the past year:  This could be the last hurrah for Black Sabbath.  And if this is the end of the legend, I, as a longtime fan, don't have any complaints about the final incarnation.  History has been much kinder to the Dio-fronted version of Sabbath than the 80's and 90's were, and that appreciation began long before Ronnie's untimely passing.  I myself resisted the Dio years for a long time, but as a fan of heavy metal music, I couldn't ignore those incredible albums forever.  The band Heaven and Hell has been immensely popular, and for good reason, because it has taken the up-and-down legacy of the Sabbath name and cemented its iconic status in the metal world.  Riding this wave of popularity, it may well turn out that Ronnie's passing ended Sabbath's career with the band back on top.  This performance, as well as the Radio City Music Hall CD, reaffirms that these guys have been successful for decades because they are the best at what they do, and Dio's capabilities as a singer and frontman were never surpassed by anyone.  He was certainly rivaled, and in some instances equaled, but never surpassed.  I love all of these songs, and I'm glad they released both DVD and CD versions.  If you're a Sabbath fan, let this stand as a powerful conclusion to a one-in-a-million band; and if you're a Dio fan, this and the new Dio Live at Donington should make this a week to remember, and to appreciate Dio's influence, skill, and dedication to the music we, his fans, will love and listen to forever.",1289779200,11,1606,4.6431095406360425
4255602,4,B0043E8YAC,"This is an impressive performance by Heaven and Hell (read Black Sabbath Mark 2 1/2 - Tony Iommi, Ronnie James Dio (RIP), Geezer Butler and Vinny Appice. Although the set seems a little on the short side - they play just shy of 90 minutes as headliners for an outdoor festival in Germany. The sound is really good, although I wish there were a few more shots of Geezer on bass. He's seen fairly frequently, but Dio and Iommi occupy the most screen time. One of the things I liked about this DVD, which some might not, is the fact that the audience is almost inaudible throughout much of the show - we get, instead, the crunch of Iommi's Gibson, the pulsating greatness from Butler's Yamaha bass, the thump from Appice's drums and Dio's voice, loud and proud and out front. The band is inspired and, possibly, unaware that it would be Dio's final filmed performance.
The bonus interviews are interesting, but I wish they lasted longer. When Geezer mentions that he liked recording ""The Sign of the Southern Cross"" for 1981's ""Mob Rules"" long player, he talks about how he loved experimenting with different bass pedals and effects. Instead of asking Geezer to explain more about the effects, like which ones were used, interviewer Eddie Trunk moves on to his next question. Eddie is a good guy and knowledgable, although (in the footage seen) he avoids asking anything about their musical equipment - something musicians surely would want to ask/know. Lol. :)
They mention recording ""Mob Rules"" for the ""Heavy Metal"" film and soundtrack, and I so wished Trunk asked them if it definitely was Appice on drums on that early version. The drums on the movie soundtrack version sound more like the style of Bill Ward (very fluid, hard yet slightly jazzy) than that of Appice's performance on the re-recorded song for the ""Mob Rules"" LP  (Appice seemingly made it a habit of pausing for a second or half-second after doing a drum fill across his toms, before coming back into the straight rhythm of the song - the drum fills on the movie version are without any breaks).
Fans might be shocked when they learn which Black Sabbath contemporary  Vinny Appice turned down for a drumming job back in 1980 ....

It's a good release. I really wish I had a DVD of the 2007 show I saw, but this release (and the Radio City Music Hall DVD) are terrific reminders of that show, and how the great talent that was Dio will be missed.",1288828800,58,2413,4.633177570093458

4255607,5,B0043E8YAC,The reason i bought this dvd was i saw heaven and hell performed on you tube about three years ago and it stuck with me. The instrumentals on that extended version is a masterpiece. Listening to it on my sound system with it cranked sent chills up and down my spine it was so good. Dio's singing was excellent on that song to. To me the audio quality is very good on this dvd and the videos about as good as a dvd can be. They also show quite a bit of the playing techniques of the guitarist not that ill ever be that good they are truly gifted. So in closing it was worth the money because it had a lot of other songs on it i like to.,1477526400,2,635,3.8923076923076922

4255627,5,B0043E8YAC,"I got this together w. the new BS/Ozzy live dvd Gathered In Their Masses. They're both great. This Dio fronted effort boasts a killer setlist that includes songs from their classic eighties albums, Heaven & Hell and Mob Rules as well as their '92 album Dehumanizer (an underrated album that's very good) and the Dio led swansong, The Devil You Know. I know this was the last recorded concert w. Dio beofre he passed away but you wouldn't know it by watching the performance. Dio is rocking like it was 1981! Full of energy and you can tell the band is enjoying the experience as is the audience.",1391472000,2,595,4.518518518518518
4255628,5,B0043E8YAC,"Fortunately,I had the pleasure to see every incarnation of Dio. In the latter years Ronnie was a member of Heaven & Hell. Saw every tour that Heaven & Hell did in my area. The music that Geezer Butler,Tony Iomni & Vinnie Appice,created was powerful as it is timeless. This disc features the final tour of Heaven & Hell. Superbly filmed it captures all at the top of their game. Highly recommend this final tribute",1373155200,,413,4.594594594594595

4255631,5,B0043E8YAC,"Let me preface this review be admitting that I am an old school Ronnie James Dio fan and have heard and seen pretty much everything that has been released commercially throughout his career... I'm also an old Sabbath fan (same criteria).  I base this review on the older material on the DVD... I've watched it twice and haven't even bothered to watch the newer songs yet!  This DVD captures the band in top form... they are smokin'!  Dio is absolutely in control of his amazing voice and is singing his ass off...  If you like Heaven & Hell and Mob Rules era Sabbath, you will be blown away!  In my opinion, this concert has a better ""energy"" than the earlier 2007 Radio City Music Hall concert DVD. I am happy to see that Dio was indeed in top form right up until the end...  thanks for the music Ronnie, you were one of a kind!  Thanks to the Sabbath camp for releasing such a top notch DVD!",1349481600,,893,4.311377245508982

WOW, way to go Tony!  Ronnies vocals are as great as ever.  Vinney and Geezer were great too.  One thing happened though, watching Ronnie sing it wanted to bring a tear to my eye at the loss of a great man.

I went to the show to see Coheed & Cambria, who opened, and expected nothing but a nostalgic Dio/Sabbath show. H&H hit the stage and immediately stole the show. I had seen Sabbath with Ozzy in 97 on Ozzfest and thought it was awesome, but Dio has much more stage presence than Ozzy and after all these years he still has(had) on of the most powerful voices in rock. May he rest in piece.",1303776000,,490,4.223404255319149

While i have the holy diver dvd and the 2007 h&h dvd which play wihtout audio inferiority, this disc seems to have the vocal audio notably undermixed.  He is well below lead guitar even in vocal moments for the most part.  There is an annoying echo on vocals also.  If I am missing something, point it out to me and I will gladly delete this review!

4255643,5,B0043E8YAC,"Excellent DVD!  The live footage is great and the sound is great.  They play a strong set mixing into the classics three new songs and an old song that wasn't on Radio City - Time Machine.  Although the song Heaven & Hell is a stample and most fans probably heard the song a hundred times, this version is not like the others; the mid-section is not just an extend solo for Toni but features what feels like a band jam session - with Toni doing some improvisation.  Country Girl is not the full song - just an annoying tease before breaking into Neon Knights.  I would have docked the DVD a half point for that tease but the DVD earns it back by who ever turned Dio's mic off during Toni's leads.  Dio was a great singer but his propensity to sing ""Oh's"" and ""Ah's"" over leads can get a bit distracting - if not down right annoying.  Check out Bible Black and Fear; you can see Dio singing but he is barely audible.  Unfortunately, Dio's mic wasn't cut during the lead on Neon Knights.

The interview are great too.  They put to rest a lot of myths.  And the tributes are touching.

Can't wait to see Dio again...in Heavy \m/etal Heaven (aka Hell).",1299715200,,1148,4.313084112149533

This was right before Ronnie found out he had cancer. Age and health considered, he sounded great.

And live on it does this dvd has many of the great old favorites but also the awesome new songs from the Heaven and Hell debut albumn The Devil You Know!!Plus Ronnie seems in great spirits in this live show if your a new fan then this is definantly a good no scratch that great way to start off especially if you liked the new albumn. To all the other fans OH HELL YEAH!! DIO DIO DIO !!! My advice is to get the DVD as opposed to the cd just to hear Country Girl but hey got them both myself.,1294185600,,716,4.085106382978723

4255652,5,B0043E8YAC,"Black Sabbath never new that firing Ozzy will give them a second life and  the Dio lineup will become a true legend on its own. ""Heaven and Hell"" is still on the list of the best rock albums ever and Dio is the only singer to have three albums on that list along with DIO's ""Holy Diver"" and  Rainbow's ""Rising"".
I thought that  Live From Radio City Music Hall 2007 was the best Black Sabbath DVD, but their last one seems to be even better. Not that they perform better, but they seem on fire and it shows that they are really enjoying performing together  having the time of their lives. I have never seen them like this. Dio's voice is unbelievable as always and I had the feeling that he'll be around forever. But, as Geezer says on the interview, it was too good to be true.. I was fourteen when I became a fan after Rainbow's debut album and now I cannot believe that Dio's gone.
This DVD is a historic monument of a legendary performance from one of the greatest bands with one of the greatest  singers. It's the ultimate proof that they are timeless and their music defies both age and death.",1293321600,,1099,4.315533980582524

4255654,3,B0043E8YAC,"It was a huge blow for me and the metal community when Ronnie was diagnosed with cancer, i had no idea until close to the end. I have been a Dio fan off and since i was about 10 or so, some albums i loved and some were mediocre. One thing that was never bad though was Ronnies voice, the man sung like hell until the day he died! Some of the music was not of the best quality from a song writing perspective, mainly because of the subject matter, but who cares, i think he was timeless. This DVD while good, isn't great. It pains me to see Ronnie and know that he knew he had cancer at this time and he struggles on some songs to really sing very well. Other songs he shines on. The band sounds old but Ronnie really doesnt, and the quality of the DVD isn't great either. Also i don't really see a reason for this release other than the 2 new tracks when you already have the first Heaven and Hell DVD which was far better and had more songs on it. This is just a rehash with a few extras. So i will never dog Ronnie because he is the Man On The Silver Mountain. But to me this was just like seeing the other show from 2007 or so.

If your a huge fan and want to pay for a few extra songs that weren't released prior, by all means buy it. But to me i'm satisfied with the first release. Also i feel the performance on it was much stronger. I think in memory of Dio they should just have released a DVD of all kinds of his live material throughout the years. Perhaps they did but i just haven't seen it yet. I know there is a CD, but i want good footage of the man, the legend DIO.!",1292371200,5,1581,3.925233644859813

Heaven and Hell at their best, Tony is actually smiling and having fun on stage, Dio hits notes to actually MATCH the guitar perfectly.  Sad that this is the last video of Dio but its very good and worth seeing and owning.",1291680000,,266,4.096153846153846
4255658,5,B0043E8YAC,"Sadly, Ronnie James Dio, one of the greatest, most distinctive singers in heavy metal, is no longer with us, having lost his battle with cancer, at the age of 67.  An articulate and intelligent man, Ronnie is remembered for his substantial musical legacy, his humbleness, and for the generosity and appreciation shown to his many fans throughout the years.

Fortunately, one of Ronnie's last live performances with Heaven and Hell, was captured on Neon Nights: Thirty Years of Heaven and Hell (2010).  Recorded on July 30, 2009 in Wacken, Germany, the DVD does a great job of capturing the band, on what is a very good night.  The camera work is solid, with a good selection of angles of the outdoor stage.  The editing that is somewhat leisurely, without an excessive number of radical cuts.

Each dressed in black, Dio, guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler, and drummer Vinny Appice, are very loose and in exceptionally fine form.  A very slim looking Dio, appears quite spry and energetic.  His voice is as distinctive and powerful as ever, as Ronnie goes for the tough notes, only occasionally saving his voice.  Always the consummate frontman, Ronnie seems completely into the performance, and appears quite animated and emotional throughout the night, even swearing a few times.  Inspiring and magical, except for the profanity, it's precisely what you expect from Ronnie James Dio.

Tony Iommi, the metal riffmaster, is rock solid, seamlessly transitioning from rhythm to lead guitar.  His solos are extremely tight, usually very close to what he recorded on the album versions.  There not much flash to Iommi, he's almost 100% substance.  A godfather of metal guitar, Tony seems to have tapped into the fountain of youth, looking fantastic at 61.  Onstage, Geezer Butler rarely moves, as his playing solidly anchors the band.  When Tony is soloing, Geezer always plays something that perfectly fills the void.  Vinny Appice, Ronnie's long time bandmate, is equally solid on the drums.  Somewhere out of sight, is Scott Warren on keyboards.

The setlist predominantly draws from the classic Sabbath albums Heaven and Hell (1980), Mob Rules (1981), and Dehumanizer (1992).  From Heaven and Hell's album The Devil You Know (2009), the band performs Fear, Follow the Tears, and Bible Black.  The new music reveals that these men have mellowed very little with age.  Time Machine from Dehumanizer is a new addition to the traditional setlist.  The song Heaven and Hell, is usually an  improvisational number, and the 17 minute extended version preformed here is one of the high points, complete with spouting flames.  It's a killer show, and Ronnie and Tony in particular, are just outstanding.

The DVD also includes individual interviews with the band members, reflecting back on the thirty years since Ronnie James Dio first joined Black Sabbath.  What is said is of particular interest, given Dio's untimely death.  As always, Ronnie displays nothing but class, taking the high road.  Also included are brief interviews with the remaining members, recorded after Ronnie's passing.

The band had previously released another concert DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heaven-Hell-Live-from-Radio-City-Music-Hall/dp/B000TSJVIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heaven & Hell: Live from Radio City Music Hall</a>&nbsp;(2007).  Also highly recommended, this DVD captures another great performance (114 minutes), at another renowned venue.  It includes songs from Sabbath's Dio Years reunion album, and classics like Voodoo, Lonely Is The Word, The Sign of the Southern Cross, Computer God, and Lady Evil, all of which are not performed during the Wacken concert.

Ronnie James Dio's on and off relationship with Black Sabbath spanned three decades, and was both magical and tumultuous.  After departing from Rainbow, Dio joined Black Sabbath in 1979, replacing the legendary Ozzy Osbourne.  Together with Iommi, Butler, and drummer Bill Ward, the new Black Sabbath produced&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heaven-Hell/dp/B001EOOQEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heaven & Hell</a>, a bona fide milestone in heavy metal.  This was followed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mob-Rules/dp/B001EOOQF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mob Rules</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-Evil/dp/B000002KYF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live Evil</a>&nbsp;(1982), featuring Vinny Appice on drums.

In the early 80's both Dio and Appice ended up out of Sabbath, and Ronnie formed his own band Dio, with Vinny on drums much of the time.  After nearly a decade as a successful solo artist, Dio and Appice rejoined Black Sabbath, recording the severely underrated album&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dehumanizer/dp/B001EOOQEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dehumanizer</a>.  After which, for the second time, Dio and Appice left Sabbath and reformed the Dio band.

Reuniting again, under the name Heaven And Hell, Iommi, Dio, Butler, and Appice recorded The Devil You Know.  The future looked promising for all concerned, when Dio tragically passed away.  To the one born Ronald James Padavona, who became world famous as Ronnie James Dio, and meant so much, to so many, may he truly rest in peace.",1291507200,3,5397,5.928848641655886
4255659,5,B0043E8YAC,"Kinda short but Dio and the rest of the black family is on top of the game, has 2 new songs from Devil You KNoe including Bible Black, which rocks.  Plus all the other staple songs, and Country Girl, which I have never seen live

4255660,5,B0043E8YAC,"I must say this is a great dvd, and is a typical crowd for Dio. The crowd was quiet for the songs, and really cheered for Dio and the guys after each song. The dvd was cleaned up, compared to the cd, which you can tell is a live album. When I heard the cd of this, I thought Ronnie was very tired, or the treatments he was getting were getting to him that nite. Was glad to see that Ronnie was in his rocking out stage and was enjoying the performance.=, so the dvd is a better thing to have just for the clean up on vocals for Ronnie.",1291161600,,535,3.8727272727272726

4255662,4,B0043E8YAC,"I was glad to see a concert dvd like this released--since it is the last video footage of RJD performing prior to his death due to stomach cancer.

I always loved Dio and only got to see him once in concert during the 1st Heaven and Hell tour.  The show was great!! I thought seeing Ozzy reunite with Black Sabbath in concert was great, and never dreamed I'd see Dio perform with them!

This dvd was filmed very well and the sound is great!  Love Geezer Butler's bass, Tony is always a near-perfect guitar player, Vinnie's drum set is the coolest I've ever seen and I just love Dio's stage presence and singing style--Dio even wears the coolest shirt I've seen a rock star wear in years!.

I just don't get why on this show and the Holy Diver Live dvd, the songs are performed a step down and Dio sings them deeper.  However, on the newer H&H songs, Dio sings them with vengence and in a higher key.  That's why the dvd gets 4 stars.  If you wanna see DIO at his peak and hear the songs sang with pure additude and higher pitch, pick up the Sacred Heart live DVD.

All in all this is a great performance.  These guys are like in their 50's/60's and still totally blow away many of the younger bands out there.  Geezer, Tony, Vinnie and the late DIO are top notch musicians.  I am glad I got to see them live in person a few years back and that the band released such a concert on DVD for us fans to enjoy watching for many years to come.",1290816000,,1437,4.166666666666667
