5012117,5,B006P3HSOW,"Recent yash raj films have been rather boring, can't remember the last time they produced something interesting and original. So I was surprised to find a really watchable film from them in Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl. Has a good storyline and is very well made.  Highly recommend this on blu ray.",1338681600,,290,4.686274509803922

5012119,4,B006P3HSOW,"Good film.  The acting is very good with all four actresses giving really good performances (especially Anushka).  The only thing that let me down a little was the plot (only one part, but if I say it will give the game away!)  That was only one small thing of a wholly enjoyable film though.",1333065600,2,292,4.37037037037037
5012120,4,B006P3HSOW,Ladies vs. Ricky Bahl (2011) is quite engrossing never boring film starring four different kinds of woman from different backgrounds. Parineeta Chopra is a Delhi Girl and is quite outspoken and funny. Dipannita Sharma is corporate CEO and is quite calm and composed and decision making woman. Aditi Sharma is the traditional Muslim girl from Lucknow simple and pretty. Anushka Sharma works in Home Town and is a brilliant sales Personnel who is hired by the other three to con Ricky who has duped all three of them and many more. Film is quite well written and well directed and Anushka again gives in a nice performance. She is quite natual and effortless it never seems she is acting. Ranveer too is ok. Its a good movie to see this weekend.,1327968000,3,743,4.679389312977099

Well-rounded characters and a great storyline. The production was beautiful with the choreography and the music, everything was very well put together.",1521936000,,195,5.758620689655173

8502566,5,B006P3HSOW,"Loved it. The story and plot was interesting and moved at a fast enough pace to be really engaging; the sets were great, the dancing was great, Ranveer is great dancer..., liked the music. Fun to watch, well resolved. Ranveer Singh was great in this, the women were great in this (love Parineeti Chopra). Anushka just always seem like she's 'acting' which throws the movie off since everyone else are characters that make the movie believable, engaging) but I liked her in this anyway due to the chemistry between Ranveer and her. She has a great smile.
Yash Raj films have always been the best. Am always happy to see one of them; a cut way above the rest in my view.",1499558400,,668,4.483606557377049

Great song numbers and Ranveer Singh played the role of a conman so effortlessly and superbly that one can be forgiven for rooting for the ""villain"" instead of siding with the girls! An excellent chick flick for a girls' movie night.....",1404691200,,349,4.645161290322581

8502572,3,B006P3HSOW,"Here, have some plot (have a plot spoiler alert, too): In Goa, where the leisure-minded are won't to go for frolic and play, Ms. Patel arrives on serious business. Daughter of a motel mogul in America, Ms. Patel is raring to prove to her father that she can successfully launch her own enterprise. In Goa she stumbles into the dashing local beach king Vikram Thappar. Vikram offers to help her with her project. He's good at greasing the wheels, at snipping thru red tape. All too soon he's become Ms. Patel's business partner. Except Vikram Thappar isn't who he claims to be. See, he's an expert con man who preys on girls and steals their money. Except Ms. Patel isn't who she claims to be, either. So who's fooling whom?

whether as the beach king ""Vikram Thappar"" or the shy ""Iqbal Khan"" or fitness trainer ""Sunny Singh"" or art dealer ""Deven Shah,"" Ricky Bahl (Ranveer Singh) has a knack for breathing life into his sham personas, to the tune of 31 tricked girls. If only he didn't have that telltale ring tone as a fatal flaw. It's how three of his victims manage to track him down. These three - the corporate raider Raina (Dipannita Sharma), demure young widow Saira (Aditi Sharma), and spoiled college girl Dimple (Parineeti Chopra) - embark on a turn-the-tables con. To pull it off, they contract the services of the free-spirited Ishika Desai (Anushka Sharma), a glib department store salesgirl who can talk water into running up. The girls instruct Ishika to go to Goa and pose as the daughter of a motel mogul. See how that went full circle?

Some good things to say about LADIES VS. RICKY BAHL, but also some botheration. First, the carrot (then the stick). Two standout performances grace this romantic comedy. Anushka Sharma as our main protagonist is effortless in her appeal. This may be the most vivacious and lively she's ever been onscreen. And, when appropriate, she tones it down to exhibit this wistful vulnerability. More than her co-lead - and I'll talk about Ranveer soon - she carries this picture. The unexpected gem is Parineeti Chopra who draws big laughs as the bratty but very likable Dimple. I like how Parineeti seems so natural, as if she weren't saying scripted dialogue. The other two actresses (Dipannita Sharma, Aditi Sharma) are fine as well, but, let's face it, their roles don't call for them to be as audacious.

LADIES VS. RICKY BAHL reunites Anushka Sharma and Ranveer Singh, and I guess they're okay together, but my opinion is that their chemistry isn't as palpable as it was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Band-Baaja-Baaraat-New-Comedy-Hindi-Film-Bollywood-Movie-Indian-Cinema-DVD/dp/B004GYWZZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Band Baaja Baaraat (New Comedy Hindi Film / Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema DVD)</a>. Probably my biggest problem is that Ricky Bahl remains an enigmatic character for the entire movie. Or maybe not enigmatic as much as empty. The overall sense is that, given his unlawful pursuits, Ricky seems like a nice enough guy. At least he restricts his predations to financial gains. Even when one of his targets throws herself at him, he doesn't take advantage. I find myself not really sympathizing with him, and it's probably because Ricky Bahl was never fleshed out enough to feel like a real person. Even when Ishika was falling for him - and we all saw that coming, right? - in the back of my head I kept thinking about those three girls who were fleeced. No lie, I was rooting for the girls' con to succeed. Having said that, one can never discount Ranveer Singh's charisma. And he can dance, which is a very good thing in Bollywood. I actually bought this DVD after having seen his live dance number in the 2013 Filmfare Awards. But, yeah, the writer(s) could've given his character a more in-depth treatment.

It's a diverting enough romantic comedy. I like the easy-breezy vibe and there are some neat comic beats. And I enjoyed the strains of DON's ""Aaj Ki Raat"" coursing thru as the girls' big sting unfolds. But we'd all seen these con movies before, and there's absolutely no new twist here. And when Ricky Bahl bitterly remarks that what he has with Ashika is ""a 100% true partnership of two liars,"" well, he makes the romance seem more pulse-pounding than it really is. Anyway, I liked the movie enough that I'm rating it a better-than-average 3 out of 5 stars.

LADIES VS. RICKY BAHL runs  140 minutes and gives you options for English and Arabic sub-titles. The DVD's bonus stuff:

- Making Of the film featurette (00:21:52 minutes, mostly in Hindi with a smidge of English)
- 18 Deleted Scenes (in Hindi, sorry, no English or Arabic sub-titles)
- ""Jasba"" music video (full version)
- Theatrical trailer",1382140800,,4730,4.942138364779874
