8289414,2,B001CU7XU2,"I almost bought this item but after watching it on youtube I'm glad I didn't. The fight scenes are cool, although a little stale in parts. Maybe it's just my bias but I think that personally, the scenese revolving around the U.S. Marines were the best shot and documented, especially the one scene where they're holding out in the abandoned shack.

That said though, the series is too disjointed to flow smoothly, leaving the viewer with the impression that Okinawa was nothing more than a couple of small scale firefights instead of the horrendous apocalyptic bloodbath that it actually was. If you want to watch a GOOD shootout documentary watch ""shootout: fallujah"" (not Return to Fallujah, that one was forgettable) If you want to learn more about the Battle for Okinawa, my advice is to skip this sorry excuse for a documentary and read Eugene Sledge's book ""With the Old Breed."" That will give you a better idea and feel for the battle than this ever could.",1252368000,2,963,4.766467065868263
