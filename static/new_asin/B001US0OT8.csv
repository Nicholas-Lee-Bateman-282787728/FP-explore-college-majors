8345010,5,B001US0OT8,"This documentary is very traditional, it makes you think about pro wrestling in a different way. There is a lot of in-ring performer documentaries but this takes the cake. Considering he is one of my favorites of all time, Vampiro has had very big highs and lows in his life and it shows a lot in this film. Whether it be his history in Mexico(AT THE TOP) or him being considered a bottom feeder in wcw. It shows how one man can over come so much with being a pro wrestler, a family man, or a fan of music and sometimes life itself. What makes a man? ANGEL, DEVIL, OR HERO?",1378339200,,573,4.171171171171171
8345011,5,B001US0OT8,Vampiro is superstar that is a legend in Mexico and Japan not so much in North America because everybody wants to portray his character overall really good movie well worth the wait and money.,1377475200,,192,4.676470588235294
8345012,5,B001US0OT8,The movie itself was amazing. I have always considered myself a Vampiro superfan but a lot of the information that was on this dvd I wasn't aware of at all. I think that it is a must have for all of Vampiro's fans and even if you are just a wrestling fan in general. This is a no holds barred in depth look at the life of wrestler day to day without all the glitz and glamor that you see on tv. The dvd was in perfect condition still in shrink wrap with the bar code sticker intact. I would definitely buy from this seller again.,1335830400,,529,4.0
8345013,4,B001US0OT8,Feel like I been waiting years for this DVD. I never could find it until now!  If you are a fan of Vampiro then you will want to get this DVD.,1309910400,,142,3.5806451612903225
