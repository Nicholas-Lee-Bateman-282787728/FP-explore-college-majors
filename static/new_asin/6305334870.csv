7887799,4,6305334870,"Being a fan of Louis De Funes, what more can I say. This movie is tops in laughs, comical situations and just so light spirited. De Funes, as usually, delivers french humour in his nervous and sharp ways. Naturally if you are a francophone you will enjoy it thoroughly. One of the many Louis de Funes 'gendarme' series that is a must-see.",1387065600,,338,4.467741935483871
7887800,5,6305334870,The movies was well made and is funny.  There is one part that's like a musical but it didn't last too long.,1152835200,,108,3.909090909090909
7887801,3,6305334870,"This movie is not as good and as funny as the first Gendarme movie. Actually, the following Gendarme movies (Le Gendarme se marie and Les Gendarme en retrait) are much funnier and Louis de Funes equally. A New York is too long and the plot weak...even for this kind of comedy. Some funny moments, but not hilarious.",990144000,3,315,4.543859649122807
7887802,3,6305334870,"I saw this picture at the Saigon Theatre on Tudo Street (formerly Rue Catinet) in 1967.  Although the Enlish, Vietnamese and Chinese sub-titles were consfusing it is still an easy story line to pick up and follow.  Perhaps the enjoyable moment was the English lesson.  None of the four  gendarmes preparing to visit New York speak any English.  The inspector  dutifully attempts to teach his superior English in an attempt to gain his  favor.  The superior can only comprehend one phrase, ""the flowers are  very beautiful.""  Nonetheless, the inspector dubbs him his ""best  pupil.""  At every introduction to dignitaries the captain smiles and  states ""The flowers are very beautiful."" The remainder of the  movie is good, wholesome slapstick comedy somewhat reminicent of the Three  Stooges, Abbot and Costello and Laurel and Hardy.",940291200,,831,5.1893939393939394
