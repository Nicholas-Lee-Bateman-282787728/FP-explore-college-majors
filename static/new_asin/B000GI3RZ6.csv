2613199,5,B000GI3RZ6,Loved watching these when i was 15 and now that im 21 it still hasn't lost its charm. If anything its just as funny as i remember. And its very much worth the price considering it would cost way more to buy each season seperately.,1509580800,,230,4.133333333333334

2613207,5,B000GI3RZ6,"I discovered the series and it's very unusual method of releasing the series, broadcast on my local Public Service station, about a quarter of the way in. A little disconcerting to say the least. I'm a fan though, duh. Currently, I'm waiting for the release of the final ( ? ) segment number 12. It does possess a curious addictive property as you get involved with the characters and the grand arc of the plot. If you are new to this series, I feel that it will take a little while for it to get fully involved, perhaps up to series two, but it is well worth it. I think it is a roughly a British equivalent to TOS Star Trek but with a lot more time between seasons. I do wish that I could get myself to Britan to watch and meet the cast and crew.

First getting into this may take some time, I feel about season 3 is where the show really took off.  The good news is you can jump into a random episode and watch without too much worry about past events in the series.

The Box is nice, very colorful and put together well.
My issue is on the start page going from the start page to say episode 3 my blue ray / dvd player can be difficult, Maybe its my blue ray but it seems like the start page won't allow you to just pick an episode, Theirs all this extra production before you can just say go from episode 1 to 4.
It felt as if they were just trying so hard to make the interactive parts just a bit over the top. Over all its nice anyway.

I thinks its a great product, it should be passed down thought the ages as a testament to what one can do with very little budget and passion for something you love.",1472342400,4,769,3.9935064935064934

2613309,5,B000GI3RZ6,"I love this show.  It is one of the most outrageously funny shows of all time.  A science-fiction / comedy, the DVD set contains all 8 original series (seasons) of the show and a plethora of extra features.  Series 1-6 each have 6 episodes, while series 7 and 8 each have 8 episodes.  I highly recommend this set.  The show has since been revived in HD with the 3-part ""Back To Earth"" mini-series and 6-episode series-10 - not included in this set because that hadn't been made when this set was created.

2613322,5,B000GI3RZ6,"This has to be one of the funniest sci-fi series made. I think the show is hilarious - but I also know some of my friends who don't. Guess you got to have a certain bent sense of humor to appreciate a show like this. It's mainly a characters based show with the focus on the relationship between polar opposites Lister and Rimmer, with supporting characters of Cat and Kryten - oh and add in Holly, the sometimes moody ship's computer AI (and who goes from being male to female about half-way through the series). Red Dwarf itself is a huge spaceship that has been traveling through space for millions of years after an accident that kills off the crew - while Lister was protected in stasis, waking to find that he is the last human existing (leastwise on the ship). Rimmer who had been Lister's annoying boss is now a hologram (and still just as annoying).

The show really evolves over the years and as the characters develop. For me the show gets better and better. So if you're already a fan of the show this box set is great, if you never seen it before - you might want to get one of the single seasons to get a taste of the show before buying the whole box set. Ton of extras through the different series sets.",1429488000,6,1218,4.318777292576419

The Japanese do wonderful flat animation, the Americans have sewn up 3-D - but the British were, are, and always will be the masters of stop-action and live models.",1425859200,4,440,4.582278481012659

1. contains up through season 8.

2. all the discs played fine, no skips, no jumps, no sound problems, no lines, no blurring.

3. early episodes are grainy but they were made a long time ago way before the 1080p days, and not being in the business, I have no clue as to if this is fixable or not.  But I loved them anyway as they are quite viewable.

4. later episodes reflect the improved quality of production in general use today.

I will forever pay homage to the show that induced me to try a Vindaloo (and poppadoms) from my local Indian restaurant.

Thankfully, Red Dwarf was re-released on DVD and since then my niece has become a convert and every time she comes over, she grabs it, pops it into the computer, and laughs so loud you can hear her throughout the entire house!

It seemed like all the BBC was interested in was how much they could make the whole production suffer through each year financially.  They had quality writing, producing, and an excellent cast, but the BBC are just like American Network execs and never gave them what they needed from the beginning to end.  Typical network mentality.
America gets most of its tv shows from Britain, in a totally different form, but we are as stupid as they are when it comes to supporting them.  It says a lot about American Networks when they have to rehash British TV shows instead of creating anything new.",1411516800,3,684,4.536585365853658

Ive loved science fiction, space opera, and much fantasy for decades. I thoroughly enjoyed  Firefly and Serenity I thought that Space Balls was great comedy. With that background, I was excited to read about this series. However, after watching the first five episodes of Red Dwarf, I concluded that it was just silly and not clever, simplistic and not challenging, and boring and rather than engaging, It might be an acquired taste, but one that I couldn't acquire in the amount of time I was willing to invest in it after having purchased the complete set.",1410220800,,750,4.8515625

I did not watch this show when it aired, but my husband did and loves it.  He moved to season 3 to get me hooked, and I am.  Now that I have a good feel for the show, we'll go back to season 1 and 2 and I'll try again.  But I have to admit, adding a female in later seasons, especially, the kind of character they created here, was a huge mistake.  It completely changed the dynamic of the show to a predictable comedic format and the kind of situation comedy that's been done to death.  I am saddened by this as I think this was a clever show and had some very funny lines.  It is hard to get past her character for me, and I find myself just wishing the scenes would end.  It's a sad ending for what I consider to be a very funny show, but overall, it's still a great series.  I saw quite a few reviews that mentioned problems with discs, but we haven't experienced that issue.  The menus are the disc aren't very user friendly, and I think those could have been done better, but that's a very minor complaint.  If you are a Red Dwarf fan, it's worth the purchase.

I'll never forget the first episode I ever saw which was the 2nd episode of series 6.  So ridiculous.  I have a couple recommendations for first episode: Season 3 episode 1 (Backwards) and Season 6 episode 2 (Legion).  Either can kind of give you a good feel for the show.  Btw season 5 is kind of dark and season 8 tried its hand at visuals over jokes (with a few exceptions) but the characters are always great.,1396742400,2,533,4.28

One thing that surprised me was how intresting the ""Bonus"" bits have been. I normally don't like these, but the ones I have seen so far are a insight into how the cast and crew approached the series; it is ilustrated with scenes from the series.

The one downer is that these disks are intended to be played in the US and when I play them them in Australia in my multi region player some of the movement is a bit 'jerky'.  It is not a real problem with the 'acting' scenes, but is very noticeable in the tracking/zooming scenes, especially the title and credits.

Overall a very enjoyable series and well worth watching

2613492,5,B000GI3RZ6,"You're reading this review either because you've never heard of Red Dwarf before or you've enjoyed it in the past and you're contemplating the box set purchase.

To the newcomer: watch it
To the veteran: buy it

My favorite TV shows have always been sitcoms, and British sitcoms hit my funny bone early on (thanks to Alabama Public Television showing only BritComs on Saturday nights). Red Dwarf became my favorite show growing up because it was the first one APT showed that was geared toward a younger audience (it played well after all the old people, who were funding APT, had gone to sleep). Eventually, APT grew to include newer shows like Chef (which I also love), The Vicar of Dibley, and the occasional Monty Python episode. Red Dwarf stopped playing about the time I went off to college, when my Saturday nights were not spent watching TV.

But my respect for this show never relented. I talked about it to people who had no idea what a BritCom was. I referenced the jokes to professors who actually knew who Gordon Bennett was. I would watch the occasional episode on YouTube. Then, finally, my sisters got me this box set for Christmas this year and I'm already on my second run through the whole series.

This series has something for everyone. I'm a science junkie, and the show talks about light speed, black holes, parallel dimensions, duality, suspended animation, etc. There's biting sarcasm, high-brow comedy, slapstick, and even potty humor. Something about British humor always got to me in a way that most of my friends (who preferred shows like ""Friends"") couldn't appreciate, and this show did it better than any other BritCom with the exception of Chef, which overplayed its hand and ran out of jokes by the end of Season 2 (still worth buying the series, though, and I want to thank my sisters for getting me that one too!!).

Another element that this show had was longevity. As I said, Chef lasted 3 seasons, and the other shows that I loved so dearly (Black Adder, The Thin Blue Line, The Inbetweeners, The IT Crowd, etc) all ran 2-4 seasons. Red Dwarf, though it took an odd 3 year hiatus starting in '94, lasted 8 seasons and recently added a 9th (sort of) and 10th (in 2012). The show has staying power because the character development that took place in the 90s stuck with viewers throughout the show's ups and downs. This has a lot to do with the writers, Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, and if you haven't read the books at all I suggest doing that before you even watch the series. You might be disappointed by the limitations of the series compared to the literature, but remember the budget that a BBC2 show was on in the 1990s.

All in all, this box set is incredible. Every season disc has a special features disc as well, which gives you a lot of insight into the history of the show itself. Again, this appeals more to the cult viewership than anyone, but once you get hooked you'll enjoy learning about the people responsible. Heck, I've never been a member of a cult before either, but there's a first time for everything, right?",1359676800,3,3069,4.611721611721611
2613493,5,B000GI3RZ6,"What a wonderful collection. The DVD extras make the purchase more than worth it, although it is kind of sad hearing the actors talk about the movie that was going to be coming out--only it never did, not in that form.",1359504000,,218,4.341463414634147

2613495,5,B000GI3RZ6,"Red Dwarf is a unique gem, mainly because it never gets old for me. Although many out there may not understand the comedic quality here (a lot of British puns/jokes) I'd find it hard to believe anyone would see it as boring. You can't find many shows with good writing anymore, usually the funny is forced after the first couple of seasons, but not in this case. The only sad part is so many of my friends don't know what the heck Red Dwarf is and it's not just something you can explain in a couple sentences. Its worth so much more.",1358208000,2,534,4.245098039215686

2613497,3,B000GI3RZ6,"First 3 Series are NOT as televised on BBC America or PBS in the states!

  The first thing I noticed was each of the menu displays cycle through their entire animations before you are allowed to do anything. Maybe the first time through these DVDs you will not mind too much. The second time through may be a different story. I tried to go back to a different episode at one point and had to sit through the entire FBI warnings before the intro and THEN the menu animations. I just wanted to go back one menu. Restarting the disc was not my plan.

  The commentary will tell you the introductions to the first seasons were done exclusively for these DVDs. Introduce flicker, Lister's paint roller jerks, and all we see is more of the ship? The 1st bonus disc includes a ""Japanese version"" of 'The End.' Now, Lister's painting the ""F"" smoothly, without flicker, pans out and shows scenes from other episodes. THAT's the way I remember it! 14-functioning exhaust ports blast Red Dwarf off camera! However, ""Original Series One"" depicts one Giant exhaust pipe on the tail end of the Small Rouge One that does not ignite, as the ship dissolves, played to slower music, without scenes from other episodes. The next beat is a starscape title-screen slowing down the pacing, instead of credits over the episode as it plays.

  CGI Scutters are still in the Japanese version! (Not a positive, but the other things that are missing are VERY appealing) Now, listen to the sound effects on the soup dispenser. I did enjoy the longer speech by George but had to suffer seeing a scutter hand-fed a mug at the sacrifice of the ship against a backdrop of planets and McIntyres' pod. Would a fully-functioning scutter even NEED to be hand-fed? Lister looks out a port window in his sleeping quarters to watch McIntyre's pod fly past but in the ""Original Series One"" we do not see anything but a starscape outside his window! No pod. ""There goes McIntyre,"" Lister says. How can people tolerate the missing scene(s) here?

  Lister's stasis booth does not hiss, Holly is digitized BADLY, Cat does not even hiss as his mouth is gaping open, and scenes of Holly ad-libbing about ""urine testing"" that ""any urine found cheating will be expelled."" These lines are missing from the english version on these DVDs. Instead, we see a failed attempt at Lister tripping Rimmer. Rimmer leans into a console only to demonstrate his hologramatic status which had already been established when Lister ran his hand through Rimmer a scene earlier. Further established when Rimmer falls through Cat.

  Intro of the Cat; music is slow, downbeat, with horns. Upbeat is the way our Japanese version, again, demonstrates.  Rimmer SHOULD clang after falling thru Cat! Maybe he scared a scutter in the hallway, off-screen. There's a similar smeg-up in 'Parallel Universe' where Cat meets Dog. There's a VERY different feel to these episodes if you change the music for a DANCER!

  Kryten should blast off on Lister's bike but we get a close-up istead. The scrolling storyline telling us the crew rebuilt Kryten should have been slowed down enough to read, without pausing. The second Polymorph SHOULD die of old age in Listers' laundry. They do later find nannites in Lister's laundry basket but it was on Starbug. Not Red Dwarf. Whatever the continuity issues are, the second polymorph should NOT be Lister!

  I did enjoy seeing the crew talking about the shows they had done, experiences with fans, why certain things were cut and added. Smeg-ups were funny for the most part. It was quite apparent to me that Doug Naylor did not like the way the first three seasons were done and changed them. However, these appear to be the ones he was not happy with.

  How do I get ahold of the first three seasons that aired on BBC America and PBS? I do not want these! This is not what I wanted for Christmas.",1357344000,5,3864,4.714285714285714

2613512,5,B000GI3RZ6,"I love Red Dwarf. I'm glad I spotted this set when it was at 1/3 the ""normal"" price. However, if there's anything wrong with it, it's that there's not enough. But, there wasn't any more when this came out, and I'm not sure whether the ""Back to Earth"" is worth it, since I've never actually seen it. The other ""problem"" is that, at least in the set I got, the Series V discs are mis-labeled. The ""Episodes"" disc is labeled as the ""Bonus Features"" disc and vice-versa. However, that is easily remedied with a Sharpie. I've had this less than a week, and I've already watched through Series VI. Apparently, they've fixed the problem listed in other reviews (Series VI only being Red Dwarf until halfway through) because mine works fine.

Well, I better wrap this up soon. My roommate spilled a goat vindaloo on my revision timetable and I've been taking learning drugs so I can finally pass the Astronavigation exam and become an officer. Up, up, up the ziggurat lickety-split!

On to the review:

The DVDs are absolutely top notch.  Every episode has commentary by the complete cast, which is fantastic to watch and listen to.  You learn so much more about the people and circumstances surrounding the shooting of this epic show.  On top of the commentary, there are great special features and mini-documentaries.  Almost every time I pop these DVDs in, I find something new to watch, listen to, etc.  I have owned this box set for four years now (purchased from Amazon in 2007), and it is one of my favorite finds.

For those who have never watched ""Red Dwarf"" before, you might be put off by the 80's, distinctly British Sci-Fi take on a comedy show.  The show is replete with cultural references specific to Britain in the 1980s... which means a great deal of the subtler humor will fly right over your head if you weren't in Britain in the 80's.  But the timing, writing, and execution of the comedy is absolutely timeless.  You WILL laugh, regardless of your age or cultural background, and you will fall in love with the quirky, interesting characters.

For those who are already Dwarfers, this is a a gem beyond comparison.  If you know a Dwarfer, get this for her/him if she/he doesn't already have it!",1318550400,5,1486,4.639846743295019

I was going to take off one star for that but it is offset by the low price of this collection.
As far as the show itself goes, humor is truly in the eye of the beholder.  Red Dwarf makes me chuckle more than laugh at loud.  If you're a real sci-fi afficionado then you will enjoy how this series lampoons serious science fiction.  If the characters are irritating, well, that's how they're meant to be!  If you like humor that uses caricature and satire then this is for you.  Otherwise, it's probably not your cup of tea.",1294444800,2,867,4.40251572327044

Honestly, it's not worth the risk to buy this. The one star reviews range from 2008 all the way to 2011, and I just recently bought it. Most copies are damaged if that is the case (If not all) my guess is that people who have bought it and have reviewed positively they haven't gotten to season VI yet. So buyer beware.

I was confident that the BBC would have gotten me a good disc if mine had been faulty.

I immediately put the S6 disc in my DVD player when the complete series set arrived yesterday; everything looked fine as I fast-forwarded the disc and jumped to different chapters. It was nice as well that each random scene was hilarious.",1289692800,3,577,4.548076923076923

It also becomes contrived in places. Performances are generally well carried out and character development at times are strained. Viewers never lose the impression that it is a British comedy and accents are at times tend to be overdone. In other words, it's a good idea to space (no pun intended) the episodes out so there are at least a few days between viewings.

As others have mentioned, DVD quality is pretty awful and they skip and have other problems.

I made a blind-buy of this box set when Amazon put it on sale for very low price. Having never heard of Red Dwarf prior to the sale, I looked up reviews, which were generally glowing.  My take: it's a great series, and the box set is a great release.

Make no mistake though, Red Dwarf is probably not for everyone.  I  highly recommend it to anyone who likes both Star Trek or Doctor Who type of sci-fi and wry British sit-coms (think insult-heavy ""Black Adder"").

This is not a sweeping space opera.  Plot takes a back seat to the gag, and the focus is squarely on the characters. Dialogue is well-written, the small cast is appealing, and some of the episode set-ups are quite clever.  As far as the quality of special effects, think of it as a bridge from 1980s ""Doctor Who"" to 2000s ""Doctor Who"".

The downside, and reason I knocked off two stars (in hopes others would see this warning), is there was a bad disc. I'm pretty sure it was Series 6, the same series others have reported problems with. I was lucky to run through all the shows when they arrived so found it in time to return the collection for a replacement (which worked fine).

The problem wasn't a damaged disc from shipment or poor packaging as there was no visible damage.

I have ""lovingly"" compared Red Dwarf to the worst ""B"" space movies ever.

It presents the entire history of the series as well as insights into the making of BBC SciFi Humor in the early 1990's.

The pilot languished for three years before it was aired.  They said it would never fly.  You had to be crazy to even attempt a SciFi Comedy Series.  And they were right.  The producers were crazy.  The writers are certifiable and the acting is exactly what you would expect from a bi-pedal cat with a fantastic wardrobe, a mechanoid with three replaceable heads who is learning to lie, a hologram (aka Smeg Head) who refuses to acknowledge that he's dead and the last remaining Human Being in the Universe, all set 3 Million years into the future.

If you have never seen the show before, think of ""The Odd Couple"" in outer space. And the main characters have the combined I.Q. of
a turnip. With the rest of their universe being just as nutty. Maybe call it a three way cross between The Odd Couple, Laurel & Hardy,
and Lost in Space. And crazy as that sounds, it really works pretty well.
As with any tv show, some episodes and series are better than others. A lot of them will have you rolling on the floor. Some are only
so-so, but only a handful could be called a poor effort.
All in all pretty good for semi-modern tv.
My personal favorites are series one and series eight.

2613626,5,B000GI3RZ6,"While it's not unusual for shows to change over time, it's rare for that change to be driven by creative necessity rather than simply getting better ratings or increasing the demographic base.  Two shows come to mind immediately - both of which I consider to be nothing less than great:  ""Primeval"" and ""Red Dwarf.""  If they were changed merely to give their audience greater titillation or bathos, as most shows are, it wasn't apparent.  These two shows didn't just suddenly get different; they slowly evolved from how they started to how they ended.  And they evolved creatively, in both instances expanding the show's original parameters.  Likewise, in both shows, the harbinger of change was there from the start; it wasn't simply tacked on: in ""Primeval"" it was, of course, Dr. Helen Cutter, whose descent into madness drove the show relentlessly toward its harrowing conclusion; but in ""Red Dwarf"" it wasn't anything as apparent as a character's psyche.  In ""Primeval,"" the evolution is obvious: it began as a ""monster a week"" show then widened its parameters to include an intriguing plot-line which raised it to the level of a psychological thriller.  But in ""Red Dwarf,"" though the change from beginning to end is as enormous as anything in TV history, it's a much subtler process.  You can't really point to a definite season (i.e., series) or a particular episode or character and say ""Ah, that's where it all changed!""

Series 1 can best be characterized as having the natural charm of innocence and naivete.  I loved the show from the very first moment.  The four main characters - Dave Lister, Arnold Rimmer, Cat, and Holly the Computer - were absolutely enchanting, with all their quirks and foibles and  vanities.  And though their interaction was awkward and tentative, even at times hostile, they made do with their lot in life: four characters all alone on a spaceship which, according to Holly, would have taken years just to turn around, let alone go anywhere.  Every episode of Series 1 focused on their attempts to establish something approaching a normal life; yet each episode took them a little farther from where they started - as well as farther from anything even approaching normalcy -  leading to the introduction of a fifth character, the android Kryten, in Series 2.  Kryten comes closer than anything else in the entire Series to fitting the standard sit-com prescription of having been added to breathe new life into the show.  However, that's only because he disappeared for the rest of Series 2 and didn't reappear till Series 3, which does make it seem as if the producers wanted to test his audience appeal before they made him a permanent fixture.  And it is true that, once he really got going, he came very close to stealing the show at times.  Just as there's never been a leading man as self-indulgent or uncouth as Dave Lister, or a Hologram as neurotic as Arnold Rimmer, or a computer as obtuse as Holly, there has never been an Android even remotely as goofy or self-effacing as Kryten.  Of course there's simply never been a humanoid evolved from a cat; but even a real cat's vanity and preening wouldn't hold a candle to Cat's.

One thing is certain: ""Red Dwarf"" becomes increasingly surreal with each passing Series.  It begins with the death of the entire crew except Lister, who had been locked in stasis for smuggling a cat on board, and Cat, who had evolved in an air shaft which had somehow been protected from radiation; and it ends with the entire crew being reanimated by an army of overzealous nano-bots.  Ironically, but not unexpectedly, life for the original survivors becomes increasingly more harrowing once the crew reappears on the scene.  And, in between, each Series takes the five main characters on one outrageous adventure after another - each adventure fully capable of being developed into an edge-of-your-seat traditional sci-fi show, but in ""Red Dwarf"" developing into a comic nightmare of epic proportions.

It's easy to say which are your favorite episodes; but virtually impossible to say which are the best episodes.  From Series 1, ""Confidence & Paranoia"" is one of my favorites - Confidence getting his come-uppance being one of the most hilarious scenes of the entire show.  From Series 4, there's ""Camille,"" which is also one of the very few episodes one might call ""poignant""  - a quality which, except for one or two episodes, mostly disappeared after Series 1.  From Series 5, ""The Inquisitor"" has just about all the elements that make the show great.  ""Tikka to Ride"" from Series 7, besides being hilarious, is quite possibly one of the most ingenious episodes in the history of TV.  And from Series 7 comes ""Blue,"" which has one of the most wonderful sequences of any episode, relating to Kryten's on-going dissatisfaction with the Kochanski from a parallel universe.  From Series 3, my all-time favorite episode: ""The Last Day.""  This is Kryten's crowning glory as a character, what with his notion of ""Silicon Heaven,"" where all the used-up electronic machines go.  And from Series 2, ""Thanks For The Memory"" is my back-up all-time-favorite; plus, it's Holly's crowning glory as a character, especially as he relates his chronology of what seems to have happened.  Then, from Series 4, there is ""Meltdown,"" which shows Rimmer at his worst and Lister at his best; Dave's final observation on the catastrophe Arnold has wrought stands as one of the great anti-war statements of all time and raises this otherwise ordinary episode to a much higher level.

Over time, my favorites have changed somewhat.  After six airings and counting, I no longer find it necessary to watch the complete series but to focus on whichever episode I'm in the mood for.  And the ones I now find myself heading for are ""Holoship"" and ""Terrorform"" from Series 5 and ""Ouroboros"" from Series 7.  The beginnings of ""Holoship"" and ""Terrorform"" are absolutely priceless; and ""Ouroboros"" is kind of the ultimate ""feel good"" episode of the entire Series. But as I said, I wouldn't dream of offering these, or any other episodes, as the best ""Red Dwarf"" episodes.  Because they're all great, even my least favorite: ""Demons & Angels"" from Series 5.  And even including ""Demons & Angels,"" I consider Series 5 to be, if not the best then the most characteristic of all eight Series.  If you could only watch one of the eight, I think Series 5 would be it.

But by far and away my favorite thing about ""Red Dwarf"" is the anticipation of watching it all over again from the start.  Now well beyond my sixth go-round, the episodes are as fresh, as interesting and as funny as the very first time around.  You can't ask for more in a TV show.",1250035200,,6693,4.852112676056338

2613649,4,B000GI3RZ6,"This is a series that I very much enjoyed once it hit its stride in Season Three with the addition of the character Kryten to the cast.  I even enjoyed it in Seasons 7 and 8 after the very substantial changes the show underwent.  The first two seasons were hurt by a very low budget, too small of a cast, and extremely low production values.  The budget went up in subsequent seasons, which helped the look of the show and enabled higher production values.  And Robert Llewellyn's Kryten instantly became the most charismatic character on the show, providing the perfect blend to the rest of the cast and serving as the catalyst to make the entire group of characters come together.

The series because a very, very different show in Seasons Seven and Eight, partly due to the departure of co-creator Rob Grant and partly due to the change of the show from a sitcom to a dramatic comedy.  In addition, Chris Barrie, who played Rimmer in the first six seasons, left the show on a full time basis in Season Seven, before returning in Season Eight.

One thing that doesn't bother me about the series are the numerous continuity errors.  Season Three starts, for instance, with Kryten, who had appeared in an early Season Two episode, as a full fledged member of the crew.  There is never any explanation as to how this happened.  The show has many instances like this.  In the new miniseries, Rimmer is suddenly a hologram again, while in Season Eight he had been a human.  Perhaps I just missed some explanations, but I can't believe I missed all of them.  But really, it doesn't matter.  I think they just realized that a slavish devotion to the premise restricted their options.  The show was never really about story, so a bit of inconsistency never really amounted to anything.

I hate to say anything negative about a show that I like, but I have to add that I find the number of five-star ratings to be incomprehensible.  This is a good show.  It is not in my opinion a masterpiece, which is what it would be if it deserved all of the five-star reviews it has received here.  At least half of the seasons of the show were weak at best, and the best did not, in my opinion, come up to the standards of the best comedy shows.  Lest someone reply that I just don't appreciate British humor let me point out that I recently purchased THE FALL AND RISE OF REGINALD PERRIN on DVD, and have long owned MONTY PYTHON and FAWLTY TOWERS.  I got an All Regions DVD player so that I could order all of Alastair Sim's films from Great Britain, which I did.  I also own nearly all of Will Hay's films, as well as the bulk of the Boulting Brothers romps.  But this doesn't mean that I automatically flip out over any and all British humor.

I like RED DWARF; I don't love it.  Being the completist that I am, I would nonetheless like to own this on DVD.  And if the set was reasonably priced I might consider it.  But until the cost for the whole thing drops by about 75% it isn't going to happen.

Thankfully, the title of this say needs revision and might actually need a lot.  The miniseries RED DWARF: BACK TO EARTH was recently broadcast (and will soon becoming out on DVD).  And there is talk of the series coming back as a regular series.",1246665600,6,3233,4.4213197969543145

2613651,5,B000GI3RZ6,"In what other show but red dwarf can you get the mixture of characters that made the show such a classic.

the show was built for comedy. 3 million years into deep space, stuck on a spaceship, you have only 4 original characters.
Lister, the last man alive who just happens to be a natural slob and layabout.
Rimmer, a hologram who is a complete control freak but manages to convince himself he isn't completly inept.
The cat, a human cat who is completly self absorbed and absloutly clueless about life.
And holly, the ships computer, who begins the series completley insane and seems to go downhill from there.

these four are then joined in series two by kryten, a demented android who seems to have a meltdown every single episode, plus his problems with his emotions.

having all these ridiculous characters, episodes, series and situations together is great to watch. but i do have one warning about the set, anone who takes themselves seriously, don't bother buying it.",1239408000,,976,4.763313609467455
2613652,5,B000GI3RZ6,"As an American, I had to watch some episodes a few times to understand the British humor and I still catch things now when I watch them again - so I get new laughs with each viewing.  The show takes right off and gets deep into the plot by the end of the first series.  Things really get going when Kryton joins the cast.

I just watched the entire series with my son over the last couple months.  He enjoyed it and I enjoyed sharing it with him.

With the exception of the last season, I believe this is some of the funniest sci fi ever written.  I'm a star trek fan, and a British humor fan - this is a great combination of both.  (The last season wasn't bad - but I felt it was dissappointing after the first 7.  Reuniting with the old crew took away a lot of the charm of just the tiny isolated crew in deep space.

A show that I just happened to catch when I was changing channels in the middle of the night, stopping at channel 31 and finding this crazy sci fi show at the age of 12. Did I know what a smeghead was? No, so I had to look it up to understand what it meant and it blew my mind. Still one of my favorite British sitcoms, along with Fawlty Towers, The Young ones, Black Adder, Bottom and Spaced.

Not only are the episodes cleaned up slightly from the VHS prints, you get tons of making ofs, interviews with cast and crew about the genesis of the project, Smeg Ups (outtakes), musical cues, extra episodes with the cast (Can't Smeg, Won't Smeg with Ainsley Harriet) and commentaries on every episode. It's a steal for the price they're offering on Amazon and always putting it off drove me to the point of insanity to see Lister, Rimmer, Cat, Kryten and Holly again.

2613674,5,B000GI3RZ6,"Review Red Dwarf?  Me?  What can I possibly say that hasn't already been said?

Red Dwarf is one of the best science fiction / situation comedy series ever produced.  I tell a lie, it is the best.  The situation?  Imagine being the last surviving human, nothing funny about that, but set onboard a spaceship some 3 million years into the future with companions that include a creature which evolved from a cat, an over-zealous underachieving holographic crew-mate, a computer with a sense of duty, direction, and humor that's more than just slightly off-center, a sanitation mechanoid that so wants to be human, plus a long lost girlfriend... if you can, imagine what day to day life in such a situation might be like.  Got it?  Good.  Now forget it and instead get ready to laugh until you cry!

I first saw Red Dwarf on our local PBS station.  A long-time fan of Doctor Who, Red Dwarf quickly became a favorite of mine.  It has remained so all these years later.

You may find yourself trading places with the characters of Red Dwarf, which is to say in it's own weird way the show reflects the struggles, the failures, and the triumphs which make us all human, a credit to its creators.  As bizarre as a given situation may be, and some are very bizarre, words like outrageous, absurd, and unreal are routinely redefined by Red Dwarf while at the same time through each (situation) a thread of humanity is woven.  Sometimes the thread is frayed, sometimes it is twisted, but it is always evident, making plausible the Red Dwarf Universe.

There haven't been many sci-fi comedy shows made.  Red Dwarf defines the genre in a lot of ways.  In it's day The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy (another favorite of mine) was just as odd, trail-blazing, and funny as Red Dwarf is today, but with one rather obvious difference between the two, Red Dwarf has the distinction of longevity... running from February 15, 1988 to April 5, 1999.

I needn't say more about the series.  Any number of others have summed it up as well or better than I possibly could.  I'm just glad I have the complete series on DVD so that whenever I need a good laugh (or need to stop taking life so seriously) I can hang with the boys in the Dwarf.  And did I mention how easy amazon.com made it for me to get a complete set of replacement discs when I discovered one in the original set was defective?  It was about as easy as it gets.",1227744000,,2406,4.505773672055427

By the second series the characters really come into their own, from the heroic lazy slob Lister played by Craig Charles to the neurotic, socially inept Rimmer played by Chris Barry they make a delightful contrast.

Constantly inventive, funny, and soul searching they explore human morality in a tongue in cheek, ironic satire that appeals to all audiences that understand sarcasm and clever toilet humor.

2613694,5,B000GI3RZ6,"Red Dwarf is a very funny, sci-fi, british comedy.  If you like british comedy or ""witty"" humor then this is the collection to get, even if your not big into sci-fi.  Earlier episodes can be compared to the ""Odd Couple"", in a spaceship though, because the episodes center around Dave and Lister, who are complete opposites, who are also lost in space.  If your not a fan of british comedy, than I suggest you rent Red Dwarf first (Netflix has the entire series).  I like it a lot better than other british comedies I have seen before.

Although I enjoyed the entire series, literally every episode, I do like the earlier seasons (or volumes, or whatever they're called) better.  The first season is my favorite.  The earlier seasons are really low budget, but that really adds to it all.  It makes it funnier!  I highly suggest to anyone, and everyone to at least rent the first season of Red Dwarf.

One last thing, if you were to buy them individually you'd pay almost twice as much as you would with buy this complete set in one shot, worth every penny!",1183593600,4,989,4.336956521739131
2613729,5,B000GI3RZ6,"I can't believe the entire collection finally came out on DVD. I can't say enough about it, and I can't get enough of this show.

This is by far the best comedy series I've ever seen, even above Monty Python, Fawlty Towers, Rising Damp, and Butterflies. I watched this show every chance I got when they were being re-run on PBS. I missed so many at the time, then I got the set. My wife hates it when I pull these back out and start watching them again, sitting around giggling like an idiot at all the cleverly witty banter and situational comedy these characters get into. It's still as funny today as the first time I saw them. Even the late episodes are great.

Some of my favorite lines and scenes came in the later seasons. Like in Duct Soup, Season 7, Ep. 4: Cat and Lister are crawling the ductwork of the ship, trying to repair a reactor leak (I believe), and Cat tells Lister he hears a sort of ""swirly, watery, rushing kinda noise"". It turns out to be the raging water of the backwash system that flushes the sewer ducts. A few minutes later, Cat says now that he hears a sorta ""windy, swirly, drying kinda noise"" and a frustrated Lister asks him if he's sure it's not a sorta ""smacking cat upside the head kinda noise"". Trust me, it's a lot funnier on the show and I can't do it justice; but it's one of my favorite scenes.

Also, this excerpt, Season 3, Ep. 1, where no matter what, Cat is worried about his appearance:
LISTER: Fasten your belt.
CAT: Hey, I do NOT need fashion tips from YOU.
LISTER: SAFETY belt!  (Points out the window) Look!
CAT: Is that what I think it is?
LISTER: What d'you think it is?
CAT: An orange whirly thing in space!
LISTER: It's a time hole.  That's where they are.  We're goin' in.
CAT: Are you crazy?  You can't go in there!
LISTER: Why not?
CAT: Orange?! With this suit?!

Again, you need to watch the show, it's waaay better. The show is non-stop hilarity and interesting characters. I can't believe they made such a great show on such a low budget. Too bad it had to end. I just hope my DVDs survive the kids...they love it as much as I do.",1182902400,65,2090,4.273417721518987
2613730,5,B000GI3RZ6,"This DVD set is definitely ""fun, fun, fun!""  It's crammed with extras like cast commentary on every episode, deleted scenes, and ""smeg-ups.""  Series 1 & 2 are classic, with cheap props and bad special effects, but, as the cast and writers continually point out, it was definitely ahead of it's time in 1988.  And, the writing is always stellar.  You can definitely see influences on later sci-fi shows, such as the holographic doctor on Star Trek Voyager.  By series 6 it gets in a bit of a rut with the same jokes repeated in every episode, but they switch up the formula (and add a female character!) by series 7.  Series 8 ends on a cliff-hanger that will leave you wishing there had been a series 9!",1181606400,3,703,4.496062992125984

2613733,5,B000GI3RZ6,"Aren't DVD box sets wonderful? I used to watch Red Dwarf on PBS when I was a kid. Looking back at the series now I realize how much of the humor (make that humour) was way over my head. I also realize how much this show shaped my sense of humor. I can't watch American sit-coms. They can't compare to this low-budget Brit-com. If you're contemplating purchasing this box set then you're already a fan of the show and you don't need me to tell you what it's about. If you're on the edge of buying it, wondering whether or not it's worth the money then I'll tell you that it is. I found myself sitting in front of the TV for hours. I had initially intended only to watch a few episodes but instead I was glued to the TV through the first two series. I had to tear myself away because it was way past midnight and I had work in the morning. The shows themselves are well worth it and the bonus material is great. There is an amazing amount of behind the scenes material for such an old show. Definitely worth the money!",1174003200,13,1016,4.16243654822335
2613734,5,B000GI3RZ6,"Honestly, I wish I could give this series more stars; Red Dwarf is the Smegin' Greatest Creation of Mankind.

I began watching this series in 1991, and I have always recommended Red Dwarf to everyone. I've been pimping Red Dwarf since the early '90s, but I never had a chance to finish watching the series.  Now that I own the entire collection of episodes of Red Dwarf, and I have finished watching the series, I thoroughly recommend purchasing the Boxed set of DVDs.

These DVDs have many extra features, edited and extended scenes, numerous extra bits, hidden features, and humorous additions which provide countless hours of entertainment.

No matter how messed-up the world is, or how much the daily news can ruin your day, this Boxed set of Red Dwarf episodes and Bonus materials will brighten your life! If you do not find the series humorous, you might want to check your pulse.

I personally feel a deep connection to the sets of the scenes, as well; Commodore geeks from back in the day will smirk often.  In fact, the entire Red Dwarf series is likely to make you laugh and smirk, as well as adopt Red Dwarfisms. When your boss is a jerk, you can just say, ""Smeeee....Smeeee.""  Your coworker will get it, but your boss or Human Resource Manager hopefully will not.  There are a wealth of inside jokes, catchphrases and memorable scenes within the world of the Red Dwarf crew.

This boxed edition is well-worth the investment!  Back in the day, I watched episodes that friends had taped, so I greatly appreciate the convenience of these great quality, well-packaged, stylish, well-documented DVDs.  I am very impressed with every aspect of this set; the collection was well thought out, and I look forward to inducting more people into the Red Dwarf Cult in the future.  Speaking of which, the bonus DVDs also include interesting Convention footage.

I will definitely update this review at a later time, but I want to start pimping the series, so more folks can enjoy the fantastic world of red Dwarf.",1170979200,113,2012,4.763688760806916
2613735,5,B000GI3RZ6,"Not expecting the box set to come out for another two years, I did my periodic search on the internet and found that the box set just been released.

Two picoseconds later, I had the box set on order, via Amazon (at a great price at that)!

I have been a devoted Red Dwarf fan, watching it on Saturday nights and during the yearly weekend marathons hosted on the PBS station (KCTS) in Seattle.

The Northwest seemed to be a Mecca for Red Dwarf (I still have VHS tape of ""Smeagheads in Seattle"" when the cast members came to visit the Seattle area.

Anyway, a short box set review:

First off, Red Dwarf is a cult British sit-com that happens to be also sci-fi. Secondly, to fully understand the concept of the Red Dwarf series, it is highly recommend that you see the first episode, title ""The End"".

A tad slow during season one, it picks up when they meet Kryten, an android butler with an overactive guilt chip.

Kryten is a magic melding between Herman Munster and Albert Einstein.

The series get better as it progresses and as the characters become more developed.

I could really go on for some time about Red Dwarf but it would pretty much be a repeat of what you would find on Wikipedia, and then do a search for Red Dwarf.

If you love British comedy, if you like Sci-fi, If you like, satirical comebacks that only the Brits can pull off then get the whole box set. I think you will love it!",1168387200,11,1401,4.333333333333333
2613736,5,B000GI3RZ6,"My whole family is ecstatic that this series is now available on DVD.  Our set of VHS tapes were wearing out!  And Amazon's price was $20 lower than the Brits' (BBC).  Thank you Amazon!
Now if only they can get a producer who won't back out at the last minute because ""British comedy isn't currently popular."" (what BS!) and finish the MOVIE that they teased us with about a year or so ago.  SIGH!",1167868800,7,397,4.324324324324325
2613737,5,B000GI3RZ6,"Aboard the Jupiter Mining Corporation vessel Red Dwarf, Dave Lister, a lowly 3rd Technician, smuggles aboard a pregnant cat and when he is found out he is confined to suspended animation for refusing to surrender the animal to the captain. During his time in stasis his bunkmate Arnold Rimmer, a lowly 2nd Technician, is forced to perform the maintenence duties without Lister's help and inefficiently repairs the drive plate, causing it to blow and subjecing the entire crew to deadly radiation. 3 million years pass until the background radiation level has dissipated to a safe level. At this point Holly, the ship's computer, releases Lister from stasis and tells him of the accident and also ressurrects Rimmer as a hologram to be a companion for Lister. After the initial shock, Lister realizes that he has the run of the ship, allowing him to be, basically, himself: a layabout slob. Rimmer and Lister discover that the cat had been sealed in the ship's hold during the accident and has bred there for the last 3 million years and evolved into man, one of whom is still on the ship. The rest of the cats mistook Lister's laundry list as navigation instructions to a habitable planet and crashed and died in space. When he discovers his new friend, Lister decides to complete his dream of owning a farm on Fiji and orders Holly to set a course for Earth. Much of this first season involves Rimmer trying to still boss Lister around even though he is just a hologram, the cat coming to grips that he is the last of his kind alive, with Lister constantly trying to get Rimmer to ""turn himself off"" so Lister can keep company with Kochanski's hologram instead. This is because the ship can only support one hologram at a time. Kochanski was the attractive officer Lister was in love with before he went into stasis.

The main dramatic thrust of the series from this point forward is Lister's attempt to get back to Earth. Along the way, however, are frequent distractions that usually see the Dwarf crew encountering strange races and lifeforms that have developed in the intervening millions of years. However, a core tenet of the series is that there are no aliens anywhere in the universe -- every element of the large and bizarre mix of intelligent life within the Red Dwarf universe is in one way or another derived from Earth, which is a result of developments in robotics and/or genetic engineering.

The crew roster changes as the years go by. During the second season, the Red Dwarf crew encounter the sanitation mechanoid Kryten, rescuing him from a long-since crashed vessel. Initially, Kryten only appears in one episode of Season 2, but by the beginning of Season 3 he has become a full time character in the series. At the end of Season 5, disaster strikes when Lister loses Red Dwarf, having forgotten which planet he parked it on. However, we later learn that Red Dwarf was actually stolen. This forces the crew to travel in the smaller Starbug craft for two seasons, with the added side-effect that they lose contact with Holly. In Season 7, Rimmer departs the crew to take up the role of his alter-ego from a parallel universe, Ace Rimmer, whose name has become a legend and a legacy passed down from dimension to dimension and is everything Rimmer ever wanted to be. Shortly afterwards, the crew find a replacement for Rimmer when they encounter another parallel version of themselves. In this universe, it was Kristine Kochanski -- Lister's long-time crush and ex-girlfriend due to merged realities -- who went into stasis, while Lister died and was brought back as a hologram. A complicated series of events leaves Kochanski stranded, and she is forced to join the crew.

Finally, in the eighth season, Red Dwarf itself is reconstructed by Kryten's nanobots that had stolen it and broken it down into its constituent atoms. In the process, the entire crew of the ship -- including Rimmer -- are resurrected, but the Starbug crew all find themselves sentenced to two years in the ship's brig on a set of convoluted charges. The series ends, however, with Red Dwarf being eaten away by a virus and all on board evacuated, save for Rimmer who is left to face Death, in the form of The Grim Reaper, for the second time. Unhappy with his predicament, he knees Death in the groin and runs away -- although the cliffhanger ending leaves this open to interpretation.

I really thought that the first five seasons of Red Dwarf were the best. I didn't care for seasons six and seven that much when the crew was traveling in Starbug. The good part of season six is that the role of the Cat was significantly increased to great comedic effect, although the trade-off is that Holly's antics are sorely missed. In season seven Rob Grant, half of the team that had created and written all Red Dwarf episodes, left the show and there was a clear downturn in quality and imagination. Kochanski's addition could not offset the loss of Rimmer, and the show just lost something. Season eight was better, since with the entire crew restored, there was more opportunity for character interaction under completely new circumstances. Chris Barrie is back as Rimmer, and this was certainly a welcome change. In spite of the fact that I am not crazy about seasons six and seven, I would still recommend the entire collection to anyone. It is far funnier and more original than almost anything else you'll ever see on television.",1165968000,203,5425,4.7558386411889595
