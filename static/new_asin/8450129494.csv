1172317,5,8450129494,"As a German teacher to 6th thru 8th graders, this was ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER.  Very easy to relate to, enjoyable, fun for the kids to see what children would love about Germany.  Highly recommend for young children.  Beautifully filmed.  Spoken in English though.",1414800000,,268,4.760869565217392
1172318,5,8450129494,Our 5yr old daughter loves this series and asks to watch them all the time.  She loves it that the little girls in the videos are around her age.,1402358400,2,145,4.0
1172319,1,8450129494,this is for younger children 6 and below not the best movie I've ever seen I wouldn't suggest it to anyone,1393200000,,106,4.095238095238095
1172320,4,8450129494,"What fun to glimpse Berlin through children's eyes!

And, by the way, why don't we recycle like the Germans do?

Loved this charming travelogue!",1368403200,,144,4.958333333333333
1172321,5,8450129494,"My 2 and 4 year old adore this series! Very gentle, fun, and educational. The Japan one is the longest at 60 mins and the most immersive, but they are all gems. Germany is particularly good for springtime, they celebrate Easter (seemingly like the USA), and see lots of baby animals in zoos and even wild boar piglets.

Germany is also the perfect one for kids who love fairy tales, they spend a fair amount of time on their Grimm's fairy tale tour of various castles, villages, and themed museums.",1364256000,,498,4.533333333333333
1172322,3,8450129494,It is definitely for kids.  Doesn't go into much detail and the production quality is average.  Nice to be able to view and let my children watch.,1364083200,,146,4.37037037037037
1172323,5,8450129494,"Perhaps the first minor caveat for all the ""Little Travelers"" series, showing two sisters in Germany, Bali, Ireland, Japan and Iran doing their thing, is that children just like to play - and explore, fool around, have fun.  So the adult viewer might be annoyed that the films don't show much really about the foreign country, just show two girls having fun abroad.  In the earliest one, the girls are only 3 and 5, so it's truly about small kids.

I, too, lived in Germany in my early 20's, not with the military.  I loved the people, language, food, music, the way of life, the housing, the mentality, the bookstores and intellectualism, and all the history in its architecture.  Probably it was the correct age to go:  finished with university, determined to become fluent in German, willing to work at odd jobs, travel independently (and very cheaply by necessity), stay with people, try any food, any experience, simply to be immersed as a young adult.

These ""little travellers"" are not only ""cute"", as Americans would say, they're of German heritage themselves.  They have cousins in Berlin, so immediately the viewers are now immersed with five girls of different ages, roughly 3 to 10, in endlessly changing outfits according to the weather.  They love playing with melting ice on the ponds of Berlin in spring, seeing the Easter celebrations and doing the Easter Egg hunt, playing in snow, visiting the great green open spaces for which Berlin is famous.  The children's play equipment in Germany is well-renowned, very innovative and challenging, giving kids a great workout on ropes designed in huge, intriguing ways for climbing.  In fact, for those in the industry - or by casual net browsing - Germany's children's toys are some of the top by world standards.  Even the whole tradition of Christmas, so child-centered, naturally began in old Germany, not in Jerusalem or USA.

Although we adults are far from childhood, and perhaps are not even much interested in real involvement with children, it is fascinating in some strange way to watch these five girls, typically German in appearance with a bit of tint to their skin, enjoy the fresh air and parks of Germany.  It's almost like watching those films about chimps learning to do sign language, who then run off to swing for the bananas.  These girls are instinctively joyful and full of curiosity, naturally because they are blessed with good health and parents who care to give them such great early travel experiences.  One might also add that the parents must have some good income for all this, but let's take that as a given, because any parent anywhere can spend time playing with his children outdoors, if he or she cares to take the time and interest.

The filming is not Hollywood standard, yet it's very well done.  I loved watching their intense faces; if anything, I'd recommend that the producer spend more time focusing on the children's concentration in talking and playing, to show their intelligence and spontaneity.  The change in clothing is amusing, as if deliberate, perhaps just accidental with the passage of time involved in the filming.

The trip down the Romantic Road with old castles, eating in special cellars with candlelight, all of this brought back very fond memories of my own time over there.

To those who enjoy seeing foreign scenes, the delight of five beautiful children running free, I can highly recommend this.  Also, boys in general are not included, making the female gender as the norm; boys who are portrayed in this series are usually seen as violent or at least naughty, not in the least attractive emotionally, and certainly to be shoved to the side of the action or scene.

Germany is often cold and wet, so this film doesn't give the 100% full truth about its weather, but hey, enjoy!  And get all the films in the series, so you can watch these two sisters get older and more interesting emotionally.",1356998400,2,3923,4.847076461769116
1172324,5,8450129494,"After living several years in Germany with children (not on a military base--just as a normal citizen), I really liked this video for its true-to-life view of what it's like to be a kid in Germany. LOVED the child's point of view (even though it was definitely heavy on the Spielplaetze/playgound scenes :). The only thing I would have added would be an element about school--since that's what kids do all day long, and there are some differences between the American and German systems. But child tourists won't be going to school, so I can see why they left that out. As to the other reviewer who felt the video lacked a discussion on ""the different kinds of clothing Germans wear,"" aside from a few festive folk occasions, Germans er, dress pretty much like Americans, but with maybe more black? So I felt like the clothing aspect was pretty accurate (they even had one little girl carrying her Schulranzen--special school backpack--when they went to Rapunzel's castle, and you can't get more accurate for child attire than that!)

If you're an adult, looking for the history of the Cologne cathedral, or an overview of night club scenes in Berlin, this isn't for you. But if you're bringing your child to Germany and want to give them a view from their eye level, this is excellent.",1314921600,,1286,4.741071428571429
1172325,5,8450129494,"I do not concur with the other review.  Of course, this is VERY subjective.  But I feel that if the person wanted a travel video, there are plenty out there from which to select.  There are many free shows on PBS alone. And, Eyewitness Travel books or Lonely Planet can easily show one-dimensional photos of the Cologne Cathedral, the beautiful landscape between Heidelberg and Munich, or the amazing city of Berlin.

The purpose of these dvds is to illustrate what CHILDREN want to explore.  I don't know of many young children who clamour to view the architecture of a new country (although parents use this as an educational tool for sure).  Rather, children want to see and experience how children across the world live day-to-day.  I find this dvd to be very educational and enjoyable.  It brought up a lively discussion afterwards. And, it held the attention of both of my children.  It is a documentary and not a high budget Hollywood film, but again that is appealing.  It is a film made for children about children, highlighting the commonalities of children everywhere.",1292457600,,1079,4.8469945355191255
7901101,3,8450129494,"This was cute but not as good as the Japan video.  There was a lot in here about the parks in Germany.  And though they certainly have much better parks than we do (and they aren't afraid of their kids getting hurt!) I was hoping for more of the history of Germany.  There is SO much history it is sad that it wasn't explored, other than Grimm's fairy tale history.",1494892800,,365,4.185714285714286
7901102,5,8450129494,"Love this show, instead of having my children watch mindless TV how about introducing them to a new country and culture. I wish they made more.",1469577600,,143,4.538461538461538

7901104,5,8450129494,My daughter loves this entire series!  It's a fantastic way to introduce the littles to geography and really good their interest. Highly recommend.,1435449600,,147,5.391304347826087
7901105,5,8450129494,"My kids (6.5 and 3.5) are homeschooled and this series is great for introducing them to other cultures and countries. It's not super-professional, no, but that's precisely why we love it so much: hosted by two young kids, it is presented through the eyes of children and it goes at a child's pace. I highly recommend it as a restful, educational approach to geography and travel for young children.",1434585600,2,398,4.782608695652174
7901106,5,8450129494,This was an excellent video that appealed to my kids on what life for German kids looks like now.  The parks they showed and the Fairy Tale road really appealed to my kids and now they are more interested in Germany than they were before.  The kids are cute and engaging.,1433980800,,271,4.294117647058823
