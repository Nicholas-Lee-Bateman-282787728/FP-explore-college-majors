Some of the comments here are so snarky I'm thinking these folks either didn't watch the film at all, or did not stay with it.  It is a delicate, nuanced performance esp in the lasst 20 minutes; this is a heroine we should all know & care about: McKenna helped in that regard.",1308960000,3,421,4.3164556962025316

1862430,2,B00008T43U,"I wish that I could say this is a good film to the audience of today, but at 2 hours it's 30 minutes too long (the film consumes 50 minutes before it gets Violette to France on her first mission), an overwatered broth adhering to the straight-on conventions of the 1950s. The fear, suffering, and execution would have been too much for the 1958 movie audience, so the film limns them but weakly.

 Virginia McKenna (Violette Szabo) is a pretty young English woman fluent in French from her early years. In 1940, with war looming, she meets French soldier Alain Saury, they soon marry, and he has to return to the French army. Cut to their daughter's second birthday party, when Virginia receives the dreaded telegram about her young husband.

Later she's approached by Special Operations to fly into France as a British agent. She accepts, and during her military style training meets officer Paul Scofield, and they drift towards romance. Their first mission to contact the Resistance is successful, but on her second mission she engages in a shootout with the Germans. She is captured, refuses to talk, and with two other young women is executed. (I've read that Michael Caine does appear momentarily in the glut of male prisoners on the train begging for water. And that, in reality, the three women were not executed by a spray of bullets as they stand but were made to kneel and shot in the back of the head.)

This is all a true story from World War II. I was attracted to the film by a Supplement on the DVD of ""Peeping Tom,"" the screenplay of which was written by Leo Marks. He was a cryptographic expert in the war and was responsible for two very important concepts used by British agents in encrypting messages: a Silk Handkerchief, given to each agent, imprinted with columns of alphabet letters, and a Poem, unique for each agent, to be memorized and used in the coding process. The poem Marks wrote for Violette Szabo begins: ""The life that I have/ Is all that I have/ And the life that I have/ Is yours."" For the ""Carve"" film,  the historical truth is distorted so that Violette's Frenchman, her husband to be, writes it, and recites the poem to her as they recline on the grass; thus it acquires emotional weight and is used in several places in the film, and indeed brings it to a close. (I've read that Marks, in granting permission to use the poem in the film, specfied that his name was not to be mentioned; and that he originally wrote the poem on Christmas Eve 1943 for his loved friend after she died in an airplane crash while training in Canada.)

Today, better the story of Leo Marks should be told, from his book Between Silk and Cyanide, and incorporate the many agents (such as Violettte) he strove to protect and save, and yes, there are ways to be truthful about the actual torture methods used by the Gestapo. As a second thought, a television miniseries out of England could be superb. (I've since discovered, and am watching, the 1987 series  Wish Me Luck, available from Amazon.)",1235606400,12,3014,4.601489757914339

Virginia McKenna's performance is moving, while low-keyed and superb, as is that of future oscar winner-to-be, Paul Scofield, (best actor, Man for All Seasons).

1862457,4,B00008T43U,"Comedies such as 'ALLO 'ALLO have a lot to answer for. While watching some of the scenes where Violette Szabo (Virginia McKenna) is interrogated by the Nazis, I couldn't help recalling parallel scenes where Herr Flick (Richard Gibson) did exactly the same thing, aided (or is it abetted) by the leggy Helga (Kim Hartman) in the Lloyd/Croft British sitcom. This offers a good example of how time can modify our perceptions of a text.

On its own terms, however, Lewis Gilbert's film is a quietly understated biopic of a naive girl with a French mother (Denise Grey) who marries a Frenchman (Alain Saury) in a whirlwind romance. He loses his life at El Alamein, and Violette responds by becoming an agent parachuted into occupied France. Together with her partner Tony Fraser (Paul Scofield in one of his rare screen appearances) they accomplish one mission successfully, but things go horribly wrong when Violette embarks on her second, more dangerous assignment.

The film has some good action sequences, shot in and around Pinewood Studios, but Gilbert's principal focus centers on the characters' interrelationships - between Violette and her father (Jack Warner), who knows what she is doing, but agrees voluntarily to keep it a secret. Violette's relationship with Tony could bloom into love, but both know that they could lose their lives at any moment, so they agree to keep it platonic. McKenna portrays the central character as an ordinary woman with an extraordinary inner strength giving her the courage to undertake the missions while remaining determined to resist any attempts to force vital information out of her.

Her transition from ordinary homemaker to toughened agent is lucidly handled, as she is at first intimidated by and then learns to cope with her uncompromising NCO instructor (Bill Owen). It is a tribute to her strength that she learns to cope with various ordeals, of being ducked in the river, of walking home on a filthy wet night, and handling a shotgun. The training proves invaluable for her later on, when she has to take on a platoon of pursuing Nazis virtually single-handed.

Despite her hopes, Violette Szabo never made it back from the War, leaving her daughter Tanya (Pauline Challoner) to collect a George Medal from King George VI. As Tanya returns to her quiet suburban home with her grandmother and grandfather, we can but reflect that it was chiefly due to Violette's selfless efforts that Britain and the Allies managed to emerge triumphant from six years of conflict.",1447718400,,2517,5.028776978417266

The movie had a different slant than the book and I would have found it hard to follow had I not read the book first.  For example, there was just a one line explanation where Violette was in prison in Paris,  This prison (Avenue Fochs) was the processing point of nearly all the captured SOE agents.  The execution scene did not match any of the possible outcomes discussed in the historical novel.
That said, it was an interesting story about a brave group of women supporting the French underground.",1418515200,,637,4.610619469026549
1862477,4,B00008T43U,"Happy Birthday Violette Szabo ([...])!  She would be 92 years old today, had she survived the war.  Violette Szabo (nee Bushell)  was born on this day (June 26th) in 1921.  She was eighteen years old at the start of World War II -- the daughter of a British taxi driver and a Frenchwoman.  She was working at a department store when the war began.  She met, fell in love with and married a French officer of Hungarian descent named Etienne Szabo. Etienne was killed at the battle of El Alamein in 1942.  It was after this death that Violette Szabo volunteered to work for the SOE or Special Operations Executive.  Winston Churchill had directed the SOE to ""set Europe ablaze.""

Carve her Name with Pride is a film version of the tragic short life of Violette Szabo.  It was made in black and white and stars Virginia McKenna.

Violette Szabo had movie star good looks.  She was a young single mother.  Fluent in French, she volunteered for hazardous missions in occupied France.  She parachuted not once, but twice into Nazi-occupied France.  She was reputed to be ""the best shot in the SOE."" The Special Operations Executive, MRD Foot.

She became involved in a firefight with the Gestapo and was captured giving covering fire to other resistance members who managed to escape.

She was interrogated by the Gestapo and tortured but did not reveal anything.  She was sent to Ravensburg extermination camp where she was subject to sexual abuse, torture and, eventually, killed by firing squad.  She was 23 years old.

Here is the unforgettable poem, written by Leo Marks that Szabo used in the field for enciphering purposes that became her theme song...

Violette and Etienne Szabo
The Life That I Have

""The life that I have
Is all that I have
And the life that I have
Is yours.
The love that I have
Of the life that I have
Is yours and yours and yours.
A sleep I shall have
A rest I shall have
Yet death will be but a pause.
For the peace of my years
In the long green grass
Will be yours and yours and yours.""

Violette Szabo won posthumously the George Cross, the Croix de Guerre, and the Medaille de la Resistiance.  They were given to her daughter Tania which is depicted at the close of the film.

If in London stop by the SOE Headquarters on Baker Street in London to pay respects.  Here you will find a plaque commemorating the organization.  The plaque is located near a lighting store whose current mission is presumably to ""set London living rooms ablaze"" with light.

Thank God for Violette Szabo and others like her who sacrificed everything for our freedom.

This film is important because it helps us to remember Szabo's extraordinary life.

From the very beginning when our heroine was called in to serve as an agent, I had a sense of doom. SPOILER ALERT*** After her first mission was successful, and when she was offered to be recruiting again, and inner voice of mine kept saying ""no, don't do it"" In the end she accomplished very little, except as a martyr to the cause of the allies. Violette Svabo was one of many women recruited, many of whom were captured, tortured and died. Apparently the British operations of this kind were not well-planned, and success rate was limited. Ultimately she is veiwed as a hero, and glorified as such. But her contributions were few, and her life ended ultimately without meaning. Perhaps she would have contributed more in life as a mother, in living to raise her child and possilby,remarry and have more children. The movie leaves me with an empty feeling. While I do agree that she was exceptional in making the effort, the problem remains that the so-called undercover missons were flawd and ill-planned.

Released in 1958 this well-written, well-directed and finely executed real life drama remains fresh, affecting and suspenseful. Recommended.",1371340800,3,455,5.422535211267606
1862492,1,B00008T43U,"If this had been made during the war I could see how they could ham it up for propaganda purposes but since this was done more that 10 years after the war you would hope that they could tell the story more honestly.  Virginia McKenna is not Violette in any way shape or form.  Forget the fact that Violette was dark and Virginia is blond, the actress just could not convey the strength and courage that the real person had.  They spend about 5 minutes of the movie showing the behind enemy lines stuff and the rest of the time they are doing a English soap opera.  What a shame to not have the decency to show the real story of a real heroine of the war.  An almost total waste of time and film.  I have read some of the books relating to the SOE and its agents and leaders and this film is a travesty.",1364601600,7,802,4.076433121019108
1862493,5,B00008T43U,"This was an amazing story.  ""Carve Her Name With Pride"" stars Virginia McKenna as Violette Szabo.  Violette is the only daughter to her English father and French mother who married after meeting in World War I. She is the mother of a daughter and the widow of a French soldier killed in North Africa.  Since she is fluent in French, she is recruited by the British Special Operations Executive (SOE)to become a spy. She agrees to the hush hush duty telling her parents that she is just driving trucks from point A to point B.  While undergoing training, she makes the acquaintance of another SOE candidate played by Paul Scofield.  The two kindle a relationship and are eventually partnered in a clandestine mission to France which they successfully complete.  Prior to leaving on the mission she gets in a minor tiff with her father and she leaves the room abruptly. In the process, something drops from her purse. Dad notices it and picks it up. It's an English Army Parachutist Badge. Dad quickly realizes that his daughter is doing something much more hazzardous then ferrying trucks around. He returns the badge to her and promises not to say anything.  On a second mission just prior to the D-Day invasions at Normandy things go horribly wrong.  THIS IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY.  Violette Szabo was a remarkably corageous woman.  Virginia McKenna was nominated for a second BAFTA Award for Best Actress. She had won the previous year for her portrayal of Jean Paget in ""A Town Like Alice.""
If you are a World War II history buff and want to learn something about a frequently forgotten aspect of the war, you will love this movie.  Also, if you are a fan of Virginia McKenna, which I am, you won't want to let this one get away from you.  It's a very suspensful film based on someone who lived the experience.",1342310400,20,1813,4.63125

Studying Szabo and other hero's of SOE is so inspiring.  If you have not, join Netflix.

It is the story of French/British resistance fighter/agent Violette Szabo, who was eventually caught and executed.  For its time, this was a great movie.  It is classic 1950's movie making (from Great Britain), which means the movie quickly glosses over some things and doesn't dig as deep into the characters as it could, but you easily get the idea what the characters were thinking and going through.  It was an award winning movie in its day.  I would love to see this movie remade today!  For what it is, however, it is a really good movie.  I would recommend it.",1518307200,,642,4.530434782608696

7987075,4,B00008T43U,"Carve Her Name With Pride, 1958 film

This movie is based on the book of the same title, a history of Violette Szabo. She volunteered for the Special Operations Executive that aided the French Resistance against Nazi Germany. Her father was British, her mother was French, and Violette spoke both languages. She worked as a saleslady in a department store, and met a soldier of the Free French. They married. Her husband died in the Battle of El Alamein. Violette was invited to join the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry to work in the war effort.

She joined the SOE to gather information and aid the French Resistance (sabotage the railroads). Unfortunately, she and her friends were attacked by the German Army. Violette resisted until her Sten gun ran out of bullets. She was captured, interrogated, tortured, and eventually sent to Ravensbruck, the German prison camp for women. She and others were executed there in 1944. Violette Szabo was awarded the George Cross posthumously and other military honors. This movie is based on the book of her life and action in Occupied France. Movies are entertainment not history, so don't complain about some details in this story.",1471219200,,1170,4.964285714285714
