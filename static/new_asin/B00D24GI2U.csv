Vidyut is still young and he can make it big in Bollywood if he sticks to his acting coz they u need acting to survive in the Bollywood industry anyone can do action.",1383091200,,467,4.367816091954023
5767343,4,B00D24GI2U,"First of all - I am not sure why Vidyut Jamwal is not mentioned anywhere on the product detail page here, as he is the one and only star of this martial arts flick - and after Force, where he was an opponent to John Abraham, this is even more incomprehensible! Rising star of hand to hand combat, with his unique combination of indian fighting style kalari with gymnastics of all things (and some others for a good measure), he is something to behold. I am very glad, as much as I like Salu with his punching style, that real martial arts arrived finaly to the indian filming industry (not only Bollywood, malayalam Urumi being another fine example of this, if not so refined). The story is very simple one of saving a lady in distress - very badly written role, I must say, even though Pooja Chopra is doing her best and even jumped 80 meters to the water herself, without stunt double! - and a knight in the shining armour (okay, dirty T-shirt) going to her help against local mob-head. We have seen the fight of one against a horde in the forest many times before in Rambo, Commando and others. But this movie is really just about one thing - to show Vidyut Jamwal at his best, and in this it succeeds perfectly. What disturbs me a wee little bit is the ending (little spoiler here, but anyone who is watching this kind of movies could have seen it from the beginning), when the hero takes justice into his own hands, which trend penetrates more often into indian cinema these days and irks a bit my sense of justice, but then, this is different culture then mine, after all.
Very good picture transfer, some behind the scene footage.
I'd give five stars, but the story is really really very simple, so...",1376524800,,1708,4.442675159235669

8588433,3,B00D24GI2U,"Actors are great, but there is too much singing and dancing.  I revere India's  culture and music, but I found the musical selections were too much of detraction  from the continuity and intensity of the plot.",1467244800,,209,4.75
8588434,5,B00D24GI2U,"Commando is a really fun movie. It takes the basic Rambo / Commando / Mission in Action style action films of the 80s and transports them to Bollywood complete with musical sequences that have guys firing their guns in the air and pretending to motor boat dancing lady butts. In a lot of ways, they've improved the formula.

The lead here is Vidyut Jamwal and I'm confused as to why he's not in more stuff. He's a lot like Jason Statham with even less talking. Most importantly, he's believable during the fight scenes and brings a kind of Jackie Chan style humor to the sequences with the sense of effortlessness he brings to it. Mr Jamwal seems to be like a big brother fighting baby brothers in a lot of scenes here and it makes it all the more humorous as more and more guys keep running into his back flip kicks. Hopefully, he shows up in more stuff.",1460937600,,855,4.377358490566038

8588436,3,B00D24GI2U,"Oddly enough, as this film starts I had flashbacks to Rambo 3. But this film has two things going for it that the Rambo sequels didn't. There are numerous scenes full of real stunts, which makes the action more amazing. And this film has heart, instead of just showcasing a killing machine.",1427155200,,290,4.596153846153846

8588439,4,B00D24GI2U,"The movie arrived promptly in the mail. It had good action, and the acting was fine. The writing was lacking, in my view, because it wasted the talents of the lead actress and made her childish.",1396828800,,194,4.416666666666667
