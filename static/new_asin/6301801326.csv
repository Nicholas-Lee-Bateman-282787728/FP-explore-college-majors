I stuck with it, and as it progressed I remember laughing hysterically. I want to see if it will make me laugh that hard again. It just got crazier and crazier until I cracked.",1417478400,,351,4.0285714285714285
7815515,4,6301801326,"This movie delights with its quirkyness, with a great cast playing things straight which makes it all the funnier. This isn't laugh out loud stuff, just one long smile as the characters become as quirky as the action ... What other movie could have the line ""You let her eat coal ... Again!""

It's a crime this movie is not on DVD",1356307200,,330,4.32258064516129
7815516,5,6301801326,"I wish someone would put this on DVD. It would be a shame for this little known dark RomCom/Horror to fall through the cracks. The cover art is misleading. This is not an S&M film. It is, however, the first gender bending horror film I ever saw.  Horror, in the fear of never being allowed to be who you are, because what you are is, too profitable. With a little madness and incest thrown in for good measure, this is a defiant treasure. I think I was about 12 years old when I saw this for the first time, and I will never forget it.",1306540800,,535,4.095238095238095
