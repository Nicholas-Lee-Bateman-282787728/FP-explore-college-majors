1968880,4,B00013D4RW,I saw this movie when it came to the Boston Underground film festival. I couldn't stop laughing.  I am so glad that Refried flicks has finally made a DVD version.  This is a really funny movie.  Definitely worth seeing.  I am especially fond of the songs!,1073520000,5,255,4.478260869565218
1968891,4,B00013D4RW,It's low budget and amateurish but it has it's moments. It made me laugh out loud a half dozen times. It helps to have seen Killers from Space before watching this Rudux. Just don't expect this to be polished because it isn't and it shows a few nice behinds what else could you want?,1464393600,2,283,4.2592592592592595
1968892,2,B00013D4RW,Not my type of movie. I read a few revues and thought it would be better. Not as funny as Radio Mystery theater 3000. I have to admit I like some pretty bad movies with some pretty stupid plots. This one is not worth your time.,1459209600,2,227,3.9565217391304346

Perhaps I set a new benchmark of 20 minutes.

1968912,5,B00013D4RW,"Do not approach this movie as if it's ""Tiger Lilly"" or RiffTrax or MST3k. If you have left-leaning tendencies and remember the Bush years with liberal nostalgia -- and if especially you have a bunch of Fabulous friends with which to watch -- then this movie is for you. Unlike ""Tiger Lilly,"" it's well-paced, with inserted footage to make sense of the ""plot"" (using that term looooooosley). Plenty of throw-away one-liners and idiotic put-downs.

1968914,1,B00013D4RW,"Boy, when they actually get around to watching MST3K, they are going to feel pretty stupid about how they tried to sell this movie.

Or, they might watch MST3K, not see any difference in the comedy, and consider themselves brilliant... which would be the only thing funny this stinker would have to offer.",1417392000,,305,4.754716981132075
1968915,1,B00013D4RW,"I didn't expect much and I wasn't disappointed. This is just pathetic. I know the people that made this think they are edgy and funny, but I have news for them. Some movies are so awful they are funny. This isn't one of them.",1414800000,,225,4.136363636363637
1968916,1,B00013D4RW,"This nothing like MST3K or Rifftrax.  It lacks humor (perhaps drunk or high people would see it differently).  Stupid movies can be good if they have some redeeming value, but I can't find any here.  If you can watch for free using Amazon Prime then make up your own mind, otherwise don't gamble, just skip this movie.  The sound track is completely replaced and short bits of fake footage has been added. This recipe could be quite good, but not when you replace all the ingredients with dried turds.",1414454400,10,501,4.595505617977528

It had me laughing all the way thru it.  I've watched MST3000, and I really like that show, and this one had the same types of one liners that I have grown to love so much over the years.
I really liked the way that bush was portrayed in this move...right on the money.
Give this one a try, I bet you'll like it.",1411430400,,440,3.8777777777777778
1968919,1,B00013D4RW,"Oh I wish I'd paid attention to the bad reviews for this film before purchasing it.  Luckily I got it for about $6 and not the $16 Amazon is selling it for at the time I write this comment.  It reminds me of an early Nickelodeon/Nick-at-Night show where something similar was done with the soundtrack being replaced by comedic riffs, but this movie adds its own footage which only distracts and at times wanders into misogynistic gratuity - if I wanted to see breasts, a woman lifting up her dress, or showing off her thong clad back side I know how to use the internet and can do so, but in this case none of these elements add to the comedy and just reek of desperation on the part of the creators of this travesty.  Many other people have tried a similar genre and done much better, a film like this with the original source material, could be done much better - avoid this waste of an hour plus of your life if you can!",1408579200,2,923,4.2628571428571425

You find the worst sci-fi movie you can on TV, turn off the sound, and use all the power of your 12-year-old brains to say ""funny"" things when the actors' mouths move.

I couldn't take 10 minutes of it. Bad dialog, bad use of stock footage mixed with home-video quality footage, poor writing, not even worth making fun of.
Take 30 seconds, to skim a few reviews and go re-watch something from MST3K or Cinematic Titanic. You'll have made an infinitely better choice.",1399852800,,484,4.574712643678161

1968925,1,B00013D4RW,"Technically speaking this MST3K type spoof of ""Killers From Space"" was well done. But even with the gratuitous nudity it got boring quick.

1968927,4,B00013D4RW,"Loved it! They took the movie ""Killers from Space,"" added a whole new script and soundtrack, and edited in some scenes of their own to spice it up.

1968928,5,B00013D4RW,"I was watching the end credits roll and the out takes, when cable news was running the bit about kids now snorting crushed up Smarties candy! Honestly, after watching this movie, I thought that the news bit and the movie's reality blurred and blended. For a moment (actually more than a moment) I was doubting what I saw on the news was serious! After a ""dose"" of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, this can happen... much like a hangover lingers.

While the benefit of years, exposure to ""50's era SF campyness"" and a sense of humor helps to fully appreciate the comedy genius this flick brings to the table, it also manages to offend virtually everyone on the planet! Gay bashing and female misogyny rank foremost, ""wound up too tight"" republicans and dems alike take a seemingly continuous whipping, while a flood of ""inside jokes"" assail the younger crowd who may have missed most of the entire 20th century. This is an unintended (or perhaps not?) byproduct of the fusion of old campv values meeting the newer, younger, more liberal or ""enlightened"" generations of late. So, we can simultaneously ROFL at the film's gags AND the huge crowd that is also not ""getting"" the humor! This is genius!! ...and way phunney, dude.

For example the line... ""I feel a great disturbance in The Lame. It's as if a billion Lamers cried out 'Dude ...really?' and were suddenly silenced!""  Murphy! 2011, requires the experiences of at least two genre to fully feel it's impact.

While much in the vein of MST 3000's satires of bad films, DADT goes stratospheric with borderline (and beyond) slanders; many likely litigious! I liked its humor and many others will as well. Some will go running to join a nunnery or into their nearest confessional. Religious radical/fanatics may simply explode in situ. So be warned. This flick can seriously warp your reality... or expand it. I give it 5 Hot Dogs. Recommended!

1968941,5,B00013D4RW,"This movie is an overdub of your typical bad sic fi movie. Making fun of Peter Graves has never before been brought to this level.

1968945,4,B00013D4RW,"DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL takes the 1954 schlocko classic ""Killers from Space"", throws out the soundtrack and in Mystery Science Theater tradition, fashions an entirely new story.

Let's face it, ""Killers from Space"" was hardly a cinema masterpiece, despite Peter Graves (aka Captain Oveur from ""Airplane!"") in the lead role.  The new story concerns Dr. Fartin (it's French apparently) who is kidnapped by ping-pong ball bug-eyed aliens and turned gay.  He tries to rail against his new sexual urges, only for the aliens to use him as a pawn in their masterplan to turn the entire male population into screaming queens...

Thanks to some gusset scenes and new characters (Nurse Bendover, Titler, Colonel Butz), the story is given a new comical edge, and the original characters are given some hilarious new identities.  This won't be everyone's cup of java, but for cult cinema fans it's a real treat.

The DVD includes original trailers and publicity material for ""Killers from Space"", plus additional extras about DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1182470400,,1070,5.222222222222222

Watching the DVD I realized I missed so many jokes the first time. The helium addict was hysterical and Titler is outrageous. It's definitely a movie to watch with a group that will need a designated driver at the end of the evening. Very funny stuff. But beware, it is too long and nobody will get all the pop culture references. I watched it with a MST3000 fan who didn't know who Barney Frank or Paul Ruddnick were.  He didn't like it.
