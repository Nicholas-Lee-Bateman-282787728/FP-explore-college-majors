8306354,3,B000BYA58W,"PRIDE 27: INFERNO should possibly have been called PRIDE 27: BIZARRO. It was a card with a number of truly weird occurances, ones which sort of overshadow the actual fights.

The spoiler-free lineup is:

Igor Volvchanchyn vs. Dwayne Bobish: A 220-pound striker faces off against a 340-pound wrestler. An ugly brawl, but not without its moments.

Sergei Kharitonov vs. Corey Peterson: The hard-hitting ""Russian Mercenary"" steps in against the aptly-nicknamed ""L.A. Giant."" Kind of a satisfying match.

Murillo ""Ninja"" Rua vs. Alexander Otsuka: This is actually two fights. The first one ends when one guy gets kneed in the groin so violently his cup splits in half. The second one, switched to later in the card to allow the knee-ee to ""recover"", is the actual fight. (This should have been called a no-contest or a DQ).

Kazuhiro Nakamura vs. Dos Caras Jr.: A Japanese prospect squares off against a Mucho Libre wrestler who wears his mask into the ring. A great opening turns into a dull match between two exhausted competitors.

Mark Kerr vs. Yoshiksa Yammamoto: This fight featured the much-hyped return of ""The Smashing Machine"" Mark Kerr to the Pride ring. It has arguably the most bizarre ending of any fight I've ever seen.

Heath Herring vs. Gan McGee: It wasn't pretty, but the last round of this fight is a kind of MMA ""Rocky.""

Mirko ""Cro Cop"" Filipovic vs. Ron Waterman: Another striker vs. wrestler match, and a good one.

I've seen better pride cards (PRIDE 26, for example), but I've also seen worse. This one has some big names and some decent matchups, but nothing that truly explodes. The extras are the usual mix of interviews, fighter bios, and gags. It's definitely worth your time, but it's not a classic.

(A note of warning - for those who want to be surprised by the outcomes of the fights, just press ""Play"" when your DVD menu comes up. If you go to ""select a fight"", you will soon discover that all the winners are on one side of the screen and all the losers on the other. Dunno why the makers of the DVD did this, but it's V E R Y A N N O Y I N G.)",1322956800,,2077,4.559139784946237
