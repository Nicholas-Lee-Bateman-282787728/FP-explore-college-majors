3751772,5,B001PO53IO,"Well, the complete season one of Clone Wars has finally been put out for pre-order. Now maybe everyone who has been crying about how George Lucas released his show will shut up. You know who you all are, and by the way George told everyone what his plans were for releasing this series. Maybe if you had read what he had been planning on doing, you would not have complained so much.

I am glad this is finally coming out as my son and I really liked watching it. I can't wait until Season two starts up, to find out what is going to happen with climax from season one. I want to know what is going to happen to Cad Bain and Zero.

Anyway, I would like George to come out with a series like this one about the years after Return of the Jedi, or even the years leading up to A New Hope. So many possibilties that he can do with this type animation.",1250121600,18,847,4.065868263473054

3751784,5,B001PO53IO,My favorite season besides the 4th. Excellent storylines. This is the real Star Wars at it best when Lucas was still involved. The series could have ended after season 5. Only a few good episodes in season 6. Rent season 6 if you can to see the end.,1466726400,,249,4.208333333333333
3751785,4,B001PO53IO,"My kids love this series, and I enjoy it too. It is a little mature as far as theme but I am comfortable with my 7 year old watching it.",1465344000,,136,3.566666666666667
3751786,4,B001PO53IO,"The Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems are at war. From one end of the galaxy to another, vast armies of clones (fighting for the Republic) and battle droids (fighting for the Confederacy) fight for control of key systems. The Jedi Knights play an important role in the war, moving from flashpoint to flashpoint as they try to bring about the enemy's defeat...unaware that they are being manipulated from behind the scenes by the Sith.

The Clone Wars is an animated, five-season TV series which fills in the three-year narrative gap between the Star Wars films Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. The Clone Wars have been a source for great speculation and discussion for fans since their fleeting mention in the original movies, and fans were disappointed that the movies only depicted the very beginnings and very end of the conflict. It falls to this CG show to fill in the bit in the middle. However, it's surprising how many Star Wars fans have avoided the series, possibly due to the prequel trilogy being a less-than-compelling series of films.

The Clone Wars actually works very well, and the first season by itself is far more entertaining than the entire prequel trilogy. One reason for this is that it taps into George Lucas's original vision for Star Wars, as an updated and more impressive version of the 1930s Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers movie serials starring Buster Crabbe. Like those old serials, The Clone Wars is a series of punchy, short episodes. Unlike those serials, The Clone Wars is not one big story. Instead, it mixes up stand-alone adventures with longer arcs and moves backwards and forwards in the chronology of the wars. This can be confusing. Several times I thought I'd missed an intervening episode, but the short run-time of the episodes (20 minutes or so each) requires them to move some scene-setting material into an opening flashback sequence, which is also used as a ""Story So Far"" device on multi-part stories. Just to add to the potential confusion, some stories in Season 1 are revisited in the third season and later.

You can mostly ignore this. In fact, the choppiness of the series does make it feel like a real war story, almost like a series of WWII news reports that flit from Stalingrad to the Pacific to North Africa in rapid succession. This feeling is helped by the show's willingness to change casts on the fly. Although Obi-Wan Kenobia, Anakin Skywalker and Ashoka Tano (Anakin's own padawan apprentice) appear in many of the episodes, the series is happy to switch to a story focusing on another hitherto under-represented Jedi character or on a bunch of ordinary clones trying to defend an outpost with no reinforcements. The series also moves through a strong variety of locations, from familiar places like Naboo and Kamino to completely new worlds to places mentioned before but not seen (like Ryloth and Rodia). In short, The Clone Wars has the entire Star Wars universe to play in and goes wild with it.

The result is a fun romp which, at its best, is pure pulp SF fun: dastardly robots, colourful villains and heroic Jedi clashing in often visually-stunning set pieces (and space battles far better-choreographed than the hideous messes in the prequel movies). But where The Clone Wars really wins points is how effectively it handles characterisation - especially Anakin's growing frustration and willingness to bend the rules, which is depicted with much greater subtlety than the films - and tonal changes. Some stories are surprisingly grim, like a detachment of clone troopers gradually being whittled down whilst defending an outpost to the last man, or the battle for the Twi'lek homeworld of Ryloth showing the shattered cities and destroyed lives of the civilians caught in the crossfire. The Clone Wars is a fun romp, but that doesn't mean it lacks depth or intelligence.

This first season is mostly a success, although early episodes feel a little hamstrung by limited art assets and budgetary issues. These mostly vanish by the end of the season, especially the gripping three-part story which depicts the liberation of Ryloth by first focusing on Anakin leading the space battle, Obi-Wan on the initial ground assault and then on Mace Windu leading the urban assault on the plentary capital. The quality of the stories is quite high, though a couple of Jar-Jar centric episodes are slightly tiresome. The episodes are also definitely aimed at children, but there are many nods to adult fans as well, and the series does not pull away from the harsher aspects of warfare (it's unusual for the good guys not to take casualties during their adventures, and the moral cost of the violence is always highlighted).

Season 1 of The Clone Wars (****) is available now as part of the Complete Season 1-5 box set. Note that the 2008 Clone Wars movie, which effectiely sets up the series (and the Season 1 finale is a sequel to it), is not part of this collection and needs to be purchased separately.",1462233600,,5009,4.880141010575793

3751824,3,B001PO53IO,I bought this three disc BluRay set for my nephew for his birthday. I was very disappointed when it arrived without the plastic shrink wrap. I thought maybe because it had the the outer hard paper cover that the inside case would surely be sealed in plastic. It was not. I looked at a white sticker on the back and it said new BluRay repackaged. This was never disclosed in the description. The discs are pristine though. The inner paper has a horrible bend in it. It's for a 7 year old though so it will still be fine. If you are a Star Wars collector this is not collectible grade.,1414972800,,583,4.261261261261262

Of course the video quality is much better and easily noticeable.  The fine details a much sharper, too, like the republic insignia on the star fighters in the background in the third episode.  On the DVD the edge detail was a bit fuzzy.  In my DVD set there was a booklet with concept art from the series but this didn't come with my blu ray version from Amazon Market place, but there wasn't really a place for it in the case.

I remember watching the animated movie in theaters and being disappointed, mostly because Attack of the Clones was my favorite movie of the prequels, and the animated, wooden characters did not accurately represent the intrigue that the legendary Clone Wars brought to mind. That said, this first season of the television show, aired on Cartoon Network, brought back my faith in the characters I loved from the Prequels. The voice acting is top notch, and the stories, all self-contained to a point, gave a lot more character development to some lesser-showcased ones from the movies and the mythology. Now that Disney owns Lucasfilm, if you want to watch this show, you may want to snag a copy quick before it goes into the Disney vault!

3751902,5,B001PO53IO,"After watching some of the Clone Wars (season 5) on U-Tube I decided to get the Clone Wars movie and seasons 1-5. I enjoyed the first season. The plots were good, the battle scenes were outstanding, and absolutely loved the sound track and music. The animation can be divided in two parts. The first half of the season I would have to get the character animation 3 stars. The nonhuman characters were fine (except for Binks), but the human ones had that frozen look and looked more like the Thunderbird TV show. However as the season progressed, I was seeing the skills of the animators growing, with better emotional expressions from the human characters, which would merit a 4 star rating. That's not surprising to see that progression. When I look back on the Star Trek the Next Generation, you compare season 1 to let's say season 4 you do notices a upgrade in production quality. From what I hear from the following seasons of the Clone Wars the trend of improvement of the animation can be seen and I am looking forward to watching them. One of the things that I really enjoyed is being introduced to new characters from the Jedi Order. I thought it was a good start to the series and the good far outweighs the negative.",1365724800,,1227,4.5565610859728505

The packing is excelent and saves space in my video library (same size case as a single DVD!) and it arrived fast and in excellent condition.

I really like the quality animation; It shows that a lot of hard work was put into this series. I see this on my home theater on a big screen and in 5.1 Dolby Digital and it feels epic. I truely like how they used the original sound effects from the movies in the series!

I was enjoying the cartoons until I noticed that I was missing episodes from Season 1 that I remembered watching on Cartoon Network.

Only then did I realise that the box in which the set came in only had 1 disc (Disc Three). The set is supposed to come with 3 discs but there was only a slot for 1 disc with Disc 1 and 2 missing completely from the set. The box also did not have a sleeve which came with Seasons 2, 3 and 4 which I ordered at the same time.

I have asked Amazon for an exchange and hope that the replacement comes with all three discs in the box. In the meantime, I am only awarding 1 star due to the defective set I received.

*UPDATE* just received a replacement set from Amazon. All 3 discs are there and the box has a proper sleeve. Was also advised that I can keep the original defective set without having to return it by post. Absolutely satisfied with my order. Amended to 5 stars!",1365552000,,990,4.061538461538461

This isn't just a cartoon for kids but can be for anyone who enjoyed the Star Wars films.  Since Star Wars films are so expensive to produce and create and there is so much story to tell it only makes sense to have a cartoon series address different story lines.  Be cautious when purchasing this exact product.  Other reviews suggest that this 4 disc DVD version comes with a 60 something page booklet.  It does not.  I'm not sure if the blu-ray or other versions of this season do.  It's worth the price for the entire season regardless.

3751945,5,B001PO53IO,"If you're looking for a review which tells you about how the DVD looks visually, go ahead and click on another one.  You're seeing Star Wars through the eyes of someone who's been blind since birth.  How's that grab ya?  I will tell you that the show takes place between episodes II and III.  I'll tell you that it is, in my opinion, one of the best things on TV these days.  And if you want to know more then you'll just have to read on.

  I've been watching this show since it first heired, and it just keeps getting better and better each season.  And I just love this season boxset.  You know the drill.  It's a complete season set so you get all 22 episodes.  And some 64 page booklet which I haven't had anyone go over with me yet.  Blind guy + concept art = no fun unless you have someone who really knows how to describe the stuff in vivid detail.  But I'm sure it's a treat.  Buy the set and see for yourself.  Don't take my word for it concerning the booklet.

  Many people I grew up with detest the prequels and therefor, skip this series.  But I grew up with episodes 1-3 so I see nothing wrong with them.  And I see nothing wrong with this hit series either.  You like lightsaber duels?  Ok, there are plenty.  Space battles?  Um, it's Star Wars so of course there are a tun of those.

  I enjoy the ground battles.  Clones versus droids seems a bit more in your face when they're doing it on foot.  But yes, I still enjoy the space battles. They're very epic and not to be missed.  I only wish that this series had one of those separate audio tracks for the blind.  Not that I use those all that much.  I think the narration is a bit distracting at times.  I'd probably watch the show without them first, then go back and turn on Mr. Disembodied Voice to get a better feel for whatever episode I was interested in.  They should get Tom Kane to do it!  He voices Yoda in the series as well as the narrator at the beginning of each episode.

  If I had to pick a few favorite episodes from season 1, I'd go with Ambush. It spotlights Yoda and a few clones.  For one thing, I've always loved Yoda.  He's just so wise, but at the same time he can own you with a lightsaber.  And all the clones are important to him.  To this little guy, everyone has a face and a name.  Then I'd have to choose the Ryloth trilogy.  It's loaded with action and we get to see a bit more of one of the Separatist higher-ups then we did in episode II.  And last of all but certainly not least, there's Rookies.  Enough said.  Just buy the set and see for yourself if you're unfamiliar with the series.

  I only wish these episodes heired in chronological order.  You can watch any of these arcs in whatever order you like and not get lost, but I've always been a sucker for watching things from beginning to end.  OCD?  Well, maybe just a little.  I'm hoping Dave Filoni will release an episode by episode timeline before all is said and done so I don't have to keep consulting wookieepedia to see whatnot appeared in flashbacks in such and such an episode-- EG battles etc.  But Filoni, director of the series, is very passionate about the Star Wars universe as a whole.  So I can see him doing this eventually.

  That's about all I can think of for now.  I could rant about how much of a blast I have watching this series, but that would fill up page after page.  Just buy season 1 and give the show a chance.  See if you don't get hooked.",1337126400,,3434,4.171779141104294
3751946,5,B001PO53IO,"I bought this DVD set for my nine and ten year old boys.  They are huge SW:TCW fans.  They usually don't get along very well, but this is one thing they can agree on.  They would watch it all night long if they could!",1334620800,,217,3.8863636363636362
3751947,4,B001PO53IO,"I'm 34 years old and, like many, grew up loving Star Wars but hating that it was diminished into a stream of toys and nothing more.  This producing a seemingly endless conveyor belt of revenue into the Skywalker Ranch. However, I still keep a fond and reasonable (I do not attend conventions) affection for Star Wars.

With that short-lived slam out of the way, I'm happy to recommend Star Wars: The Clone Wars-the Complete Season One.  I bought it for my 4 year old son who recently discovered Star Wars and all the toys ($$$).  We enjoy watching the shows together and I love the added story lines to the new (disappointing) prequal trilogy.  Specifically, the story lines that add to what we all already know about Yoda, General Grevious, and the clones are great fun to watch. The animation is top notch and only improves the experience.  I look forward to purchasing all the seasons that have been released. Additionally, the quality of the packaging that this season comes in is great and is worth keeping on a shelf and not in a box in the basement.

S1 of TCW is a great start to what is now going on it's 5th season. However, this show is not for everybody, particularly old-school die-hard fans such as myself. There is some obvious contempt to EU continuity on this show as a whole but if I can overlook (at least some) of that then I would think most other long-time fans could too. Along with S2, the cover and booklet inside is both a sight to see and an excellent choice IMO; though for some reason S3 stopped doing this and upset a bunch of fans. If you're a fan of SW and tolerate Anakin's questionable new padawan, or if you'd like to get your kids involved in SW, then I would definately recommend this season.",1333152000,,810,4.266233766233766

3751950,5,B001PO53IO,"I was definitely one of those skeptics who didn't think Star Wars would work as an animated show. I especially was worried about the art style. However, after hearing that Darth Maul was coming back, I decided to try it out - and ended up loving it.

The show is very respectful of the movies and does a good job building upon the themes in the original and prequel trilogies while adding its own new characters and stories. Ashoka Tano, Anakin's apprentice, has a wonderful combination of sass and charm. Assaj Ventress, Dooku's apprentice, adds the first true female villain to the series. Even more impressive, the series makes you care about the clone troopers, who act much more like American G.I.s than Stormtroopers. The very first episode, which features Yoda, reminded me much more of Yoda from empire Strikes Back than anything in the prequels. His love for nature and emphasis on cunning over brute strength. Even Jar Jar and the Battle Droids, who come across as ridiculous in the movie, are genuinely funny in the show.

While there are some ""silly"" moments, the show is much more mature than you might expect from a cartoon. In some of the better episodes, the show depicts the reality of war far better than Attack of the Clones. ""Innocents of Ryloth"" was particularly moving, with the little Twilek girl who tagged along with the clone troopers. Cad Bane, the new bounty hunter, brings a new level of awesomeness and brutality. Bane kills his enemies without remorse, even going so far as to kill Jedi babies.

Overall, if you like Star Wars I'd recommend giving the show a try. It's not just for kids. I haven't once felt ""silly"" for watching it. In fact, it does some stuff better than the movies.",1330041600,,1715,4.71
3751951,5,B001PO53IO,"Ever wonder what happened in the 3 year gap between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith? With all the hate directed towards the prequel movies, maybe you shouldn't answer that one.  Having recently rewatched the prequels in their new blu-ray incarnations, I think they are judged way too harshly. The most glaring weakness of the movies, especially episodes 2&3, are that they feel rushed. For example, Anakin falls too easily. Also, Anakin and Padme fall in love too easily. Lots of plot holes and explanations of those plot holes are seemingly left for other movies that will never get made. Well, that's now not necessarily true with the arrival of The Clone Wars cartoon. The creators are allowed to take their time building up characters and plotlines that could only be done superficially in the movies, including the classic original trilogy. It makes me wistfully wonder whether there might some day be a cartoon based on Episodes 4-6. There probably will.

Season One was preceded by a full length movie, The Clone Wars, which is also available on Blu-ray, so make sure you watch that before you start the series. The main event of the movie was Anakin gaining his first and only (?) Padawan learner, the feisty but lovable Ahsoka. Most of the Jedi have become generals in the Republic Army, blissfully unaware that Chancellor Palpatine, aka Darth Sidious is orchestrating the entire Civil War with the help of Count Dooku, and HIS apprentice, Ventress, the not quite Sith assassin.

While Anakin, Obi-wan, and Ahsoka are the main characters of the series, the writers seem to view the show as more of an ensemble piece. For instance, episode 1 stars Yoda, and not the crotchety know-it-all of the prequel films. He is shown more as the laughing trickster of Empire before Luke found out his true identity. I think he only laughed once in the prequel trilogy, and that wasn't very whole hearted. Other episodes feature Jedi that looked cool in the movies but sometimes never even spoke, like Luminara, Aayla Secura, and Kit Fisto. I guess Kit did have a semi-speaking part in Revenge of the Sith. IF you could call dying screaming like a little girl speaking. Other episodes feature clone troopers and even the much maligned Jar Jar Binks as the main stars.

A lot of the episodes have 2-3 episode story arcs which are just as good as if not BETTER than any of the live action movies. I know this might sound incredible but after finishing the first season multi-part finale, I'm actually feeling like I enjoyed this TV show even more than the live action movies, EVEN the original trilogy which I completely loved. Watching the Clone Wars cartoon, the Star Wars universe just seems so much richer. You actually have time to deal with the consequences of character's actions.

One of the things that bothered me about Attack of the Clones was when Anakin went berserk and killed all those sand people. Yoda sensed his pain and that something terrible had happened. But we never did get to see whether Yoda asked him about it. Or did Obi-wan ever ask him what happened on Tatooine. Or did Yoda or the Jedi ever think for one second WHO had really ordered the clone army to be manufactured. Like was it such a good idea to just show up on Kamino and just pick them up no questions asked. I would want to know who had ordered them and what their intentions were before I armed them and let them loose on the galaxy.

While the live action movies didn't have time to ask questions like these, the cartoon does. For example, in one of the later episodes, a clone goes bad, or let's just say, he turns against the Republic. He sees the Republic and the Jedi as slavemasters, ordering him and his ""brothers"" to lay down their lives for no reason other than being commanded to. It really flips the tables on who is right in the Star Wars universe. One mystery that is further compounded by showing how individual the clones are is that it just seems unbelievable that they would carry out Order 66 so I hope the writers somehow figure out a way to resolve that.

While it would have been nice to see some of the stars from the films do voice acting, the back story is a welcome expansion to the Star Wars universe.
While I enjoy this because of my fandom, it does not require a serious devotion to Star Wars to be enjoyed. The show is family friendly, maybe PG (I believe I heard the word ""damn"" once or twice), but a great purchase. People of all age groups will enjoy the action, the well-rendered animations, and the stories held within this DVD series.

3751961,4,B001PO53IO,"While I enjoyed the new trilogy let's be honest, the more CGI Lucas has to play with the less he pays attention to the story. The original story trilogy was great because Luke, Lea, and Han were fighting side by side and becoming closer all the time. That is what I really like about the Animated Series. Anikan, Asoka, and Obi-One are fighting the Separatist and growing closer ... sarcastically. My one complaint is the series will jump away from a story line with only the narrator to fill you in on why. Very unsatisfying in a couple instances. However, the major arcs do follow the three act play of the two trilogies. Watching the Jedi in action is worth the price of admission and the characters and moral tales makes it worth watching again.",1325030400,,749,4.555555555555555

The movies dives into some of the morals and moral dilemmas faced by not just the characters in the movie but in real life too.

Obi Wan.
Anakin.

3751980,3,B001PO53IO,"So, the original releases of Clone Wars Seasons 1 & 2 came in nice DigiBook packaging which included concept art in a book inside the hard cover book that held the 3 discs.  Something that made these releases unique.  So now, Season 3 comes out in a standard 3-disc Blu-ray case, so in order to prepare for this change in packaging, WB re-releases the first two seasons in standard cases as well apparently back in September about a month before Season 3 comes out.  But here's the kicker.  The digibooks ran around $40 new on or around release day, and now the prices on these re-releases are over $50.  What's up with that?  Downgrade in packaging and you jack up the price?  These should be discount releases.  $20-25 max. The only justification for the increase in price would be if these include DTS-MA HD sound over the original 640 Kbps DD tracks.  But that's stretching it.

It's great that Star Wars is still around and still cranking out new content for yet another generation of wannabe space pilots.

3751983,5,B001PO53IO,"Ah season one, right after the pilot movie; ""Star Wars the Clone Wars"" I can't give an in-depth review because, well that's just not something i'm good at. The original star wars fans will love this series because back in episode four ""A New Hope"" fans noticed that when Leia was appealing for Ben's help she said something among the lines of ""You served my father in the Clone Wars"" apparently this caught fan's and (possibly) Lucasfilm's attention. Well people, you asked Lucas and now he's devoting an entire computer animated series of the clone wars, it has a perfect mix of the old star wars elements and is kid friendly too. I love every season of the clone wars and what's special about this one was the suspense it gave me in almost every episode back when season 1 episodes were broadcasting on TV. Every episode kept me entertained on different levels.

I loved every episode and the season finale shows fans what kind of tone and setting to expect in season 2, it gets darker, more serious, intense, and violent (not too violent of course).

So for those who are skeptical about this series, just give it a shot. The animation isn't the best but Lucasfilm animation was just starting out and the animation DOES get better in every season and according to their commentary, they are really trying to reach out to new and old star wars fans alike.

Final word on this season: This season was simply awesome, and I can't wait for season 4 episodes to come on this fall :)",1314144000,3,1480,4.556390977443609

As others have said, the picture on the blu ray is near reference quality.  The packaging is so excellent that I can't imagine anyone not displaying this out in the open.  In fact this is my favorite set i own now next to Pacific/ Band of Brothers metal box sets.",1314144000,,567,4.222222222222222

  track 3-how about a trip through a monster filled nebula and a giant ion cannon?
  track 4-a bunch of space battles mostly
  track 5-big shootouts and a giant eel tries to eat the clones
  ok that was disc one.who the heck drew the humans' noses?they look like ski slopes!
  disc 2
  track one-r2 gets droid-napped.there is also a space battle inside a meteor shower.
  track 2-general grievious vs ashoka tano.r2 vs the new astromech droid.[its actualy a really cool fight].
  track 3-jar jar is mistaken for a jedi.this is one of my favorite episodes.some comic relief from all of the killing in the war.someone i know was complaining about jar jar.the usual stuff like he's stupid and stuff.then he went on to say he didn't like the 7 ft tall,non talking teddy bear[chewbacca] or the really little teddy bears from the forest[ewoks] or the big slug{jabba}.then i got to thinking,jar jar isn't any sillier than any of them.
  track 4-a lot of battles on this one.it is all fighting.asajj ventress takes on luminara and ashoka.
  track 5-this is my favorite one of all.im a big kit fisto fan.he reunites with his padawan who is now a knight.nadarr is very aggressive.he,kit fisto and a bunch of clones battle general grievious.
  so on that disc,there were 2 of my favorite episodes.
  disc 3
  track 1-a brief battle goes down between anakin and dooku.obee and anakin fight a monster in a tube they are falling down.
  track 2-anakin,obee and dooku are captured and put in a cell together.they must work together to live.big shootout later.
  track 3-space shootout.anakin,alaya secura,clones and ashoka battle droids.anakin is injured and cant fight.a monster tries to kill clones.there are some aliens who look like a cross between a dwarf and a monkey.monsters are hippo griff like.
  track 4-a space shootout.there is a new super weopon the bad guys made that destroys all organic matter but does not harm things like droids.
  track 5-bear like aliens vs the clones
  track 6-droids attack a place that looks like the emerald city.lots of shooting.asajj ventress vs obee and anakin
  disc 4
  track 1-a virus will be released if no one stops the bad guys
  track 2-lots of shooting.virus is released and good guys race to escape tunnels before being exposed.
  track 3-you must push sideways in order to see the cartoon and not some guy yapping.the r7 astromech debuts.ashoka goes on her first flying mission.there is a space battle.there are heavy losses and ashoka gets depressed.it is very dramatic.
  track 4-an air vs land battle.shootouts.there is a little girl twi'lek.a robot tries to feed locals and clones to his monsters..clones and obee vs monster.another big shootout.
  track 5-twi'lek warriors,clones and mace windu must get into a castle.
  track 6-a bounty hunter snipes away.a bunch of bounty hunters are in this one.anakin vs the ig-88 style droid.later,anakin fights 3 bounty hunters briefly.
  so,thats that! it was all totaly awesome except for those funky old noses.do i really have to tell you whether or not to buy this?its gold! better than gold,its diamond! or better yet some new star wars universe element thats more precious than either of those 2.
  i think it is an important part of the entire star wars story.but,of course,i played both knights of the old republic games,watched all 6 movies.watched the 2 old clone wars cartoons,watched the 2 new cgi cartoon seasons,played force unleashed and read the entire 19 book series from the new jedi order.i even wrote my own stories where there wasn't one.",1306368000,,3792,4.9411764705882355

3751990,5,B001PO53IO,"When I first heard and read about 'The Clone Wars TV', I thought 'what's next?!  I mean is this really necessary?  Isn't Star Wars finished?  I thought the Clone Wars movie was OK, but not great and definately not needed.  But the TV show is much better than the movie, really great star wars in the style of the 3 originals: quick pace, lots of space battles, good stories, and excellent visuals.

I consider the clone wars movie to be a practice session for the TV series.  I'm happy this show is being made and I am enjoying Star Wars as much as ever.

I notice the reviews for the blu-ray and DVD are are mixed together.  I am watching the DVD on an upconverting DVD player on a 32 inch 720p screen and it looks fabulous!  A very clean and sharp image if you don't have blu-ray.  The animation is very smooth and fluid and the backgrounds are pure Star Wars.  I read complants about the character's appearence, but I think they look good.  I always focus on the eyes and these are well done with lots of subtle movement in the eyes and eye lids.  I like this effect more than movies like Final Fantasy that try to be photo-realistic but seem to have the fixed stare look much of the time.",1304121600,2,1192,4.267857142857143
3751991,5,B001PO53IO,"I'm a big fan of most things Star Wars.  I loved the original triology, I liked Revenge of the Sith, would give a nod to episode II and a shrug for episode I.  The Star Wars novels are hit and miss (The Thrawn Triology is the hallmark of any SW novel series), and the comic books are generally amazing.  When it comes to The Clone Wars microseries which preceeded the CG version currently running I was at a loss.  The microseries delivered action at a steady, relentless pace which eclipsed much of the story line and left little to no room for character development.  In regards to the action it is very over the top and unbvelievable even for Star Wars.  If the Jedi were truely capable of the feats shown in the microseries the war would have ended at Geonosis or Mace Windu would have killed Palpatine during their confrontation on Coruscant.  Anyway I'm sure your wondering where my review for the Clone Wars CG Animated series is... well its right here.
The Clone Wars is awesome.  When it comes to cartoons I believe the Japanese are the best and I was delighted to learn that the style in which this series is portrayed was inspired by Japanese anime.  The animation does not degrade the action and lightsaber battles are as breathtaking as ever.  The characters actually resemble the actors who portrayed them in the movies and that is a testement to the talent Lucasfilms has working for it.
When I started watching the series I expected poor dialogue and no character development but I was proven wrong.  The dialogue is good, all though ""I have a bad feeling about this,"" needs a rest as it is used at least once or twice per episode.  I actually found myself laughing at the character's remarks and even thinking that a few lines were witty.  To get to the point no one feels out of character when their speaking.  The voice acting is good and only gets better as the series goes on.  The voice actors really capture the essence of their characters, especially Count Dokku and Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious.
Right from the start you get the impression that this is a character driven story which is my favorite kind.  Obiwan is still the calm Jedi Master and Anakan now a Jedi Knight excersises his new authority as a General by disobeying orders because he can.  A great new development for Anakin's character is the addition of his new padawan, Ashoka Tano.  Put simply Ashoka embodies Anakin as a padawan, she is defient, headstrong, a Jedi with seemingly limitless potential, but above all she forms connections.  Ashoka like Anakin understands the Jedi beliefs about forming connections but finds herself unable to not care about her new Master.  In little time at all Anakan finds himself attached to Ashoka as the series progresses and the question is asked can he let her go when the time comes?  Another interesting character is the clone Captain Rex.  Rex represents the clone soldier on the field of battle.  He is loyal to the Republic and the Jedi Generals he serves but he is not a mindless automaton.  Rex has a personality that comes out through the progression of the story.  He looks out for the men under his command and believes that the mark of a good commander is experience.
So all in all The Clone Wars is a great series.  It embodies what Star Wars should be and while it might seem like a show for children it evolves to appeal for all ages.  I'm 22 and can't get enough this show.  So when you watch this series don't let it go right away if your feeling meh, give it time and you'll change your mind.  Like all things this show needs some time to warm up and when it does get ready for Star Wars as it should be.",1303689600,,3659,4.535060975609756
3751992,5,B001PO53IO,"This is the first item I have felt compelled to right a review about.

Now I am an almost 21 year old, female, college student.  I have always loved Star Wars and it has been a part of my family's life for many years.  I am not hard to please, in that I can watch a lot and be happy, but I do not give credit when credit is not deserved.  I saw with the most sincerity that this show (as of Season 2's release) is amazing and does nothing but continue to impress and astound me.

The animation, incredibly rich. The storyline, deeply gripping.  The character development, amazingly composed.  This show gives you a deeper an more personal look at, not just the main characters but the entire Star Wars universe, making the tragedy that was Anakin Skywalkers ascension to the Dark side.  The voice actors do an amazing job of sounding bot unique and similar to the actors in the live movies.  In some ways, you almost like the portrayal of the characters better in the animation then in the live action because of how much further it pushes the Star Wars universe.  At times you forget you are NOT watching the live action, because the animation in this show is just that good.

This animated series also leaves us with many new questions, (like that of Ahsoka's death, because we all know she is going to die) that create a new understanding of many of the characters and the entire Star Wars universe.  This show should not be missed, especially if you consider yourself a Star Wars fan. ;)",1301875200,,1491,4.4411764705882355

I absolutely loved the movies episodes 4-6, but was quite disappointed with episodes 1-3 and had since accepted that Star Wars would never be as good as I remembered as a child.  However, this series has rekindled that excitement!

In my opinion, these shows are superior to the last three movies released...superior story and even the acting is better.  The movies are 2-D (Episodes 1-3) compared to these cgi works.  Congratulations to the creators who have breathed new life into what had become a dull, flat universe that I had once loved as a kid.  Thank you!",1289088000,,686,4.870689655172414

I choose not to pick apart the story or its relevance to the Star Wars universe but greatly appreciate its value to a new generation of science fiction enthusiasts.  I watched the entire series without stopping and have shared episodes with friends.

The series could be a little violent to some parents so I do warn to that regard.  There are some valuable lessons to young viewers.  The stories are excellent and I look forward to Season 2.

The packaging is very well done and feels like a collectors item instead of standard packaging.  The case cannot be fastened closed and may be susceptible to little hands.

Enjoy!",1289001600,,712,4.595238095238095

And man was I blown away! Finally a Star Wars production that captured the rich universe like the original film trilogy. So naturally, I was anxious to see what I had missed out on with Clone Wars Season One, and the Blu-ray specs alone were enough to warrant a purchase.

I must say, however, the first half of Season One is mostly a disappointment. There are couple of cool episodes, especially one penned by Paul Dini called ""Cloak of Darkness"" and another called ""Lair of Grievous."" Otherwise, the first 12 episodes of the series are slow going in finding their real stride. By the time you get to ""Jedi Crash,"" however, the show starts to build steam. I think the main reason for this is that the creators were desperately trying to find the right balance between kiddie and adult entertainment (and that's no easy thing). But I'm happy to report that they do, and to much greater effect by the time we get to Season Two, which is practically flawless.

Other than a slow start story and character wise, the Blu-ray set of The Clone Wars is downright impressive. Seeing this show in widescreen 1080p is the ONLY way to see it. It's just gorgeous. Add to that mini-featurettes on EVERY episode and several directors' cuts, and you've got one of the best tv series Blu-ray sets available. If you've been on the fence as to whether or not you should commit to this series, I highly recommend you give it a chance.

Or just skip the movie and Season One and start with Season Two...",1287619200,,2125,5.492354740061162

The DVDs arrived in the mail and I didn't open them for a few months since I was busy with work, family, etc.  When I finally watched the first episode, I was hooked!  These 20-25 minute episodes are surprisingly entertaining even for an old guy who still remembers watching the original Star Wars film at the drive-in.  If you watch these episodes with an open mind and don't expect the same effects as the original trilogy you will enjoy them.

The loyalties and bonding between Clone troops and their Jedi commanders. Take that to motion picture #3 and the betrayal is... worse.",1285718400,,531,4.720430107526882

During many of the episodes I couldn't help but grin at the excellent animation, intense action, and swashbuckling feel of the whole thing.  Sure, it has some drawbacks, not the least of which are the episodes that center on Jar Jar, but for the most part it's a great series that manages to be fun without pulling any punches.  Highly recommended.",1285027200,,472,4.662650602409639
3752035,5,B001PO53IO,"For starters, if you have not seen the Clone Wars movie, you might want to start with it before getting this set.  The movie sets up a lot of the basis behind new characters involved in this series such as Anakan Skywalker's Padawan (Ahsoka Tano), and Count Dookus Apprentice or assassin, Asajj Ventress. These two characters will be involved with many of the tales without any history provided short of the movie.  Now on to the series.

When I first played it I was not completely engulfed into it (like a Star Wars movie), but once I got adjusted to the animation and the storyline picked up I was hooked.  It is as action Packed as the Star Wars films.  And although it might not have exactly the same actors who played in the movies voicing their character, the voice over actors are great and almost sound like the actor who originally played each part.  The only time I really noticed it was when Count Dooku emerged.  You can tell that this is not Christopher Lee voicing the character.  Not that it does not sound like Christopher Lee, it is just that the voice over actor is actually better at playing this part than Lee. The plot line of most episodes are well written and will please most Star Wars fans (Even those who call themselves Trekkers).

The case this set comes in is as unique as the show itself.  It is not a standard plastic case with a leaflet or two thrown inside.  It is a Book that has two sturdy holders on each hardback book cover to hold your dvds in place.  As a bonus it includes a 66 page book in the center featuring concept drawings of the show and other items of interest used in the development of this show. Overall 4.5 stars for the show, 5 stars for packaging, and 5 stars for the extras.

Overall this set is well worth the price and makes an excellent show to watch.  Can't wait to get the second season.",1284854400,,1848,4.3654970760233915

3752038,5,B001PO53IO,"I have recently watched Season One of The Clone Wars on DVD while, at the same time, reading The Official Episode Guide to see if I missed anything while I was watching. The DVDs are wonderful, and it has been great fun to watch the episodes again after seeing them originally on TV. Each episode includes a featurette showing director Dave Filoni and other key members of the production team talking about the development of the episode. All were very interesting. Also, a few of the episodes are presented as director's cuts, so they show some footage we have not seen before. Great fun. The package also includes a booklet showing drawings and pictures.

The Official Episode Guide is also very useful. Each episode is covered separately with a synopsis, pictures, background information, and lists of the cast, characters, weapons, and vehicles. I found the book to be helpful if you read about each episode after watching them on the DVD.

Then there is the Character Encyclopedia for Clone Wars. The book covers more than 200 characters and gives you a description, statistics, a picture, and specific background information for each. The characters are listed in alphabetical order so you can always look up a particular one you might be interested in. As is true with most Clone Wars items, the book has a great look to it.

I am pleased that The Clone Wars series has been successful enough to spawn all of the books and the DVDs that have been issued. The quality of the packaging has been excellent, and I am optimistic that we have a great deal more to look forward to.",1281830400,,1581,4.721014492753623

Sometimes there are three episodes in a row that can be stung together to make an longer plot point, but for the most part it dose not matter the order you view them.  The worst is between ""The Hidden Enemy"" and ""Blue Shadow Virus"" (between disc 3 and 4).  In it Aniken an Obi-one are stuck surrounded by droids then the next think you know they are the only to available Jedi to help on Naboo.  (They are surrounded by Jedi).

Coherence to the side this is still a fun adventure for any age.",1279411200,,563,4.081818181818182
3752041,4,B001PO53IO,"Great addition to the Star Wars legacy.  I think animation greatly frees some aspects that were more difficult when you had live action, even with CGI.  Yes, some of the dialogue can be lame.  I agree with the individual that every writer should be fined, flogged or both every time they write, ""I got a bad feeling about this"" for ANY character.  It's uttered by a different character in almost every episode.

At times you feel the Jedi are really showing their strengths and why they were so powerful.  Other times, you kind of go, ""huh?""  Case in point: in one episode Obi Wan is about to catch the bad guy.  He's right there.  The bad guy throws some capsules off a three-story high platform (or more) that will be disastrous if they hit the ground.  Does Obi Wan use The Force to suspend them in mid-air?  Nope.  Throws himself off the platform to catch them in his hands while falling to the ground himself.  While it certainly adds to the dramatic tension (the bad guy throws or threatens to throw these things repeatedly to thwart capture), it seems you could stay truer to Jedi capabilities and find dramatic tension another way.  There are a number of instances like that where they don't do things that would be very simple, while using The Force in very dramatic ways elsewhere.

One other surprise.  In one episode, a trooper exclaims, ""What the h*ll?!""  What the h*ll, indeed.  While I could see the inclusion of such an exclamation in a director's cut, that kind of language has no place in the series. Now I'm hesitant about letting my 5 year-old watch the episodes.

Those are my caveats.  Other than that, the series is entertaining and forwards the whole storyline from the ""missing years"" between the live action episodes.  It would almost (ALMOST, I say) be a welcome addition to have one or two small interactions inserted into Episodes IV, V & VI where Vader encounters R2D2.  He's so close to the droid in this series, you could really put some subtle moments in where one recognized the other and was torn about what to do.  But that's what comes from doing the last episodes before the first ones, I suppose.  Sure wish Lucas would follow through with the original intent of having Episodes VII, VIII and IX.  Love to see the original stars come back as their aged characters bringing along a new generation.  I think the reception of the most recent Star Trek movie and others show that there's a big market for building on the nostalgia from 30 years ago.",1279238400,,2484,4.601366742596811
3752051,1,B001PO53IO,"I do love me some Star Wars, well specifically the first trilogy (ep. 4,5,6) and the ""Knights of the Old Republic"" VG. The second trilogy(ep. 1,2,3) was awful...lots of flash and no substance. I was really hoping this Clone Wars series was going to make up for the turds Lucas put out with those last three movies, but I was sadly mistaken. The show looks great, but the characters are sooooo wooden. Who hires these writers? I understand it's a kids show, but there is no fun or joy to these characters. ""Avatar, the last airbender"" was a great kids cartoon...the characters in that series were dynamic and fun to watch, you actually care what happens to them.

Also, i personally think every writer on this show should be fined $1000 every time they make one of the characters say ""I gotta bad feeling about this!"". Bleeech, my womprat could fart out better dialogue than this....and he's been dead for 15 years!",1279065600,7,914,4.6419753086419755

3752053,5,B001PO53IO,"Eliminate anything with the word ""Pixar"" attached to it and how many films or TV shows manage to appeal to both 5 and 50 year olds without completely alienating one or the other?  Perfect?  No, but much closer to it than any of the prequel films.  Had the Jedi and clones been given this much character depth in Episodes I & 2, Episode 3 would have been a beautiful tragedy (well, until the horrible overacting kills the last 3rd - no way to recover from the Emperor and Darth Vader's unintentionally comic ""Nooooooooooooo!"").  When I caught Episode 3 on TV after having seen the first seasons of Clone Wars with my son, I found the clones' betrayal of the Jedi much more involving.

And really, there's not one line of dialogue that's any worse than fully half of the trite, obvious prequel dialogue.  If anything, at times it can be subtle enough to border on bland - they rarely dumb down the technical talk for the younger set.

Where I think the show is really underrated, and where the DVD really shows off, is in its production design.  There's not a cartoon on TV with this depth and detail.  The lighting and texture rendering is absolutely stunning.  Even watching it on SD cable I picked up on that, but (and I don't even have the blu-ray) the DVD on an HD set is really gorgeous.  The featurette docs (on EVERY episode, thank you) also reveal how much work goes into each episode, even while cluing you in to some of the production limitations (and how they combat them with creativity).  Especially amazing to pull off 22 episodes in the era of 13 episode cartoon seasons.

If you only made it as far as the Clone Wars movie, you're missing out.  I actually hated the movie and found it extremely dull, but find the series far superior.  Yes, the ""claymation"" style molding of the animation my take some getting used to, but if the sculpted hair puts you off, focus on the subtlety of facial features and expressions until you get used to it.",1277769600,,1955,4.498583569405099
3752054,5,B001PO53IO,"I'm not a Star Wars nerd but I really enjoy watching this more adult oriented, CGI animated Star Wars series.  The show has a more serious tone with some humor mixed in. My thoughts below:

GOOD

1 - The special effects and sound are awesome, especially on blu-ray
2 - The freedom the show has to come up with different characters, monsters, weapons and locations to keep everything fresh instead of being locked into a story like the prequel movies were
3 - Great value, I paid $32.99 for 22 episodes then proceeded to watch them all over one weekend, now I need to catch up to Season 2
4 - The voice acting is very good

BAD

1 - The enemy needs smarter, more accurate droids since they couldn't hit Jabba the Hutt if he was sitting in front of them plus the Jedi seem to slice and dice them like a Ginsu 3000

UGLY

1 - Jar Jar Binks, he shouldn't have been in the movies and he definitely shouldn't be in this show
2 - The packaging, the third disc is halfway under the second disc which makes it very hard to remove and put back.  I'm sure if they can put all that money into the show, they could hire someone to figure out a little better scheme for the discs

It's a great show and I was happy to hear it has been renewed for Season 3 starting in October 2010, which is when Season 2 will be released on DVD and Blu-ray.",1276387200,,1327,4.112403100775194

The behind-the-scenes featurettes are interesting and informative. A little bit of appearance of 'the Checkered one' and the other directors would have been nice.

I live in Japan and when I played this on my Japanese BD recorder, it automatically came up in Japanese, which is a thumbs up for me. This seems to be a WB trend. And about one-fifth of the price sold in Japan! (the Japanese product does come with other goodies like good luck charms you don't really need. lol)

Lovely 68-page Production Journal built into the casing.

What was MOST EXCITING was that in some of the featurettes, you get to see a few snippets of the Star Wars movies (from all episodes) in GLORIOUS HD! Which kind of makes you think that they have already done the HD transfers for all 6 movies, right!?

3752059,5,B001PO53IO,"The prequel universe always had its own appeal and potential, if overshadowed by the film implementations themselves. If having any flaws, The Clone Wars lacks in the cerebral and favors action, which is actually quite a positive change over the precursor works. It is also a positive change to see the Jedi Knights and Masters of this period developed more fully and placed into more action scenarios, again a great contrast to their drier applications of the past.

Pros:
1) Great Quality Picture and Sound
2) Decent Special Features
3) Fresh and Fun Style
4) Good development of weapons, ships, and concepts of the period

Cons:
1) Dialogue often bland
2) Reaches for the ""Reset Button"" too often
3) The global plot and plots of given episodes do not seem to have coherency. The Republic seems to have controlling victories almost every time in the episodes themselves, but is said to be losing ground overall. This becomes strange and almost disorienting after a dozen or so episodes.

3752060,4,B001PO53IO,"I fell in love with this series near the end of the first season on Cartoon Network. The visuals just keep improving - from the movie to this series, season one to season two. I believe that computer objects used for things like the ships and primary characters have reached a level of sophistication that much of the work on new episodes goes into the creation of new shapes and objects to continually create new characters, worlds and ships. Inexplicably, following the disastrous writing of the prequels, the writing for this cartoon series has far surpassed expectations. Perhaps Lucas should stay with 30 minute limits.

This collection is great with the minor exception of the keeper. The method they use to store the disks doesn't hold them reliably in the cover when it is standing in a rack.

3752076,4,B001PO53IO,"I don't have much to say about season one of Clone Wars. I saw the movie version in the theaters that was supposed to be the first few episodes and thought it was entertaining. The dialogue was campy and it was obviously geared towards kids, but the action and fight sequences were surprisingly engaging and should appeal to any Star Wars fan. I'm about halfway done with season one and so far this seems like the lost Star Wars cartoon that was missing from my childhood. Clone Wars features most of the same characters from the newer trilogy (Anakin, Padme, Obi-Wan, Palpatine, Dooku, Grievous, Yoda, Mace, etc.) but also gives minor characters (like clone trooper Commander Cody or Jedi Master Plo Koon) a chance to show their significance within the Star Wars universe. One of the main characters is one who never appeared in the prequel trilogy: Anakin's padawan Ahsoka. Its interesting to see Anakin's skills as a Jedi mentor, a side we never quite saw in the movies. As a Star Wars fan I have been more than satisfied that the show decided to use other characters to drive the story, not just the same ones we have gotten to know over the course of three movies. Its different to see a story concentrating mostly on the Clones or on a random Jedi only seen in glimpses from the trilogy, but this is a high selling point for a fan like me who is not truly finished with Star Wars. The dialogue is still cheesy, the nicknames are stupid, and some of the situations seem impossible to get into or out of, but it is a fun show that I believe improves on what was a buzzkill of a prequel trilogy. Due to the limitless possibilities of the computer animation used in the show, the fight sequences and space battles are actually cooler to watch in the cartoon than in the movies (with the one exception being the Darth Maul duel of the fates from Phantom Menace). I would highly recommend this show to anyone who wanted more from the prequel trilogy or any fan still loyal and longing for more Star Wars adventures.",1271635200,,2015,4.523287671232877

However, the concept art with notes on this one are very interesting and you get the feeling that the animators really cares about making a great show. The extra material mainly consists of a small behind the scenes  featurettes (around 7 minutes) for each episode with more concept art and some great insight from the creators. The episodes them self are top quality, I am constantly surprised of the level of detail on the characters and ships. Voice acting is excellent and the characters are likable.

They are able to go into more depth with the characters and really start to care what happens to them.  My son was not happy when he later found out that Anakin become Darth Vader.  This cartoon brings Star Wars to a new generation, and makes it cool again.  This is also a cartoon that my husband and I can sit down and watch and not be bored or annoyed.  This is not a strictly for boys cartoon either, my daughter love the Ashoka character.  My kids are constantly playing Star Wars games now, and look forward to Friday nights when the new show comes out.

Voice work is great, CGI is beautiful to look at, and the music (even though it's quite a departure from William's standards) is also perfectly done.

Even though the epsiodes are each less than a half hour, they all have a huge scope and nice character development.

While it is animated and broken down into the short episode format, the Clone Wars has greater story strength and is even more ""adult"" than the prequel triology ever was.

The animation is high quality and the choices for the character voices are spot on, evoking both the animated Clone Wars movie and the live-action films.

I admit a little bit of the thrill is taken out when the realisation sets in that all the main characters are going to survive until Episode 3 ""The Revenge of the Sith"", where many of them won't even make an appearance or warrant a mention (Ventress? Ahsoka?).

I find the characters a little 1-dimensional and the back story development nearly non-existent - but my 8-year-old loves everything about the Clone Wars, so they must be doing something right!",1268092800,,828,4.783216783216783

3752110,5,B001PO53IO,"I never understood why, when I arrived at the theater to see the new Clone Wars film, the place was not packed with Star Wars fans. I loved the film. Just loved it. I thought it was incredibly well done. The action sequences were about the best I'd seen in animation. The story was good and I loved Ahsoka and her interactions with Anakin. Everyone looked a bit funny with the style used but that was alright. It's a cartoon after all. I didn't expect life-like images of Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen.

So of course, I had no problem sitting down with my son to watch the series either. And we have both enjoyed that immensely. The stories are always thoughtful and have the same mixture of humor and drama that characterized the original films. They are a bit episodic in nature but they have multi-part episodes and to a degree they all tie in, so it's not an endless series of planet-hopping to no purpose. You understand why the Jedi are there, what their goals are, and what the goals of the Separatists are. We get to see some of the Jedi we barely saw in the films, including Aayla Secura and Kit Fisto (even his padawan), and we see more of the Jedi Temple and its inner workings, including the crotchety old librarian who was so snippy with Obi Wan when he went there for help in finding Kamino.

We also get to meet the clones, up close and personal. We get to see that despite being clones, they have different personalities. We get to see Commander Cody, the man who would eventually try to kill Obi Wan, and Captain Rex, and others. Knowing that these fellows will obey Order 66 and one day try to kill the Jedi they often times so clearly admire, is touching. If you've played Star Wars Battlefront II you've already experienced this to a degree from the eyes of the 501st - the boys Anakin took into the Jedi Temple to exterminate the Jedi in Episode III.

Why would anyone turn down the opportunity to delve deeper into the Star Wars universe?

Remember at the beginning of that episode how the crawl said ""there were heroes on both sides""? Here you can meet some of those heroes. That line had always struck me and I'd always wished Lucas had been able to expand upon the idea. Now he can. Who were the people and the creatures who led the Separatist forces? If you want to find out, watch Clone Wars.

If you're a Star Wars fan, give the show a chance if you haven't already. Just open your mind the way you did the first time you sat down to watch the first movie. I was skeptical that rainy day back in 1977 when I went to the theater to see Star Wars. We were bored and decided to take a chance. It was a life-changing moment, the most memorable film in history. While the cartoon may not compare visually (it's a cartoon after all) it further fills out the story you fell in love with on that day. Like George Lucas said, Star Wars is ultimately about Darth Vader and his redemption. If you want to get to know him better, watch Clone Wars. He's got a hard edge, and you an see the elements of his personality present that take him to the Dark Side later, in Episode III. And I think what takes place in this series makes that development a little easier to understand, since Lucas had to telescope the transformation to fit into the films. I doubt by the time we are done with the series that it will seem all that abrupt when we sit down to watch Episode III again.",1267574400,,3397,4.334905660377358

My work schedule changes constantly and I'm constantly forgetting to set a recording for the Cartoon Network broadcasts, so I was very pleased when I saw a boxed set of season one come to the stores.  However, I wasn't pleased with the price they were charging.

After shopping around in stores and online I found Amazon was selling season one for $10 less than the cheapest price I was finding in any store.  I had never bought anything from Amazon before and was very pleased with the easy to use website and the free shipping was awesome!  My DVD set even arrived several days before it was scheduled.

3752117,3,B001PO53IO,"That's the main problem with this show.  The design is great.  The animation is fantastic.  The voice acting is decent and no doubt will get better as the show progresses.  The picture on blu ray is outstanding.

From a visual standpoint, the series offers complete immersion into the SW universe.  If that's mainly what you want and are not too concerned with the writing, this series will suit you just fine.  For the majority of the 22 episodes the scripting is about equal to that of the prequel trilogy.  If you are fine with the writing in episodes I - III, you will absolutely love this.  If you did not like the writing in those films, I would recommend renting this before purchasing.  There are a handful of excellent episodes, but too many others are chock full of things I did not enjoy about the prequel trilogy and that is the reasoning for my three-star review.  Ironically, the first episode is probably the best of the 22.

A number of races, cultures, and planets within the canon are featured prominently.  Lots of characters who were mere background pieces during the prequel trilogy are brought to full life here, and it's a great thing to see.  There are some excellent space battles and if you love to see the large and small starships of the SW universe in action you will be very satisfied.  It's a great expansion on film for many things we fanboys (and girls) have only read or dreamed about.  The clones are featured quite prominently, so those of you familiar with Karen Traviss' writing will also find much to enjoy.  While many characters are featured, Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Anakin's padawan Asoka are definitely the main focus in the majority of the episodes.  Personally I would rather that not be the case because the galaxy is so large and the story possibilites are unlimited, but that being said there is plenty of deviation throughout and hopefully even more in future seasons.

There are behind-the-scenes features for quite a few of the episodes, one of which revealed that a particulary memorable villain was voiced by George Takei!  A nice surprise for Star Trek fans.  The packaging of the blu ray is excellent.  It is a book-like case containing quite a few pages of conceptual designs and notes from the pre-production period of the show.  The three discs are encased on the inside of the front and back covers and the aforementioned pages are between.  As you can see the cover has one of the Clone commanders, and if you display the package near your tv while you watch it's a menacing enhancement to the show.

So that's that.  Pleny to enjoy for Star Wars fans old and new alike, and plenty of room for improvement in regards to better writing in future seasons.  For those of you with the mindset that ""it's only a cartoon, what do you expect?"", I can point to numerous action/adventure cartoons with far superior writing and character development.  See Justice League season 2 and Justice League: Unlimited season 1 and 2 for examples.  I hope this was helpful to those of you on the fence.",1265328000,12,3040,4.672316384180791

When I heard that Lucasfilm was going to do an animated movie and series, I was at first skeptical, because I was so used to the live action and special effects. However, I saw the movie, and have watched every episode of this series, and I have to say that it's actually really good. It's a way to continue the Star Wars saga for those of us who are going through withdrawal from the original and prequel trilogies. Most of the vocal talent is close enough to the real actors to make you forget that they're not the same people, and the storylines are entertaining. Plus, there's some good humor thrown in too, especially from lesser characters and pretty much any droid that appears.

3752154,4,B001PO53IO,"I've been a Star Wars fan my whole life (I saw Empire Strikes Back in the theater when I was 3); seen all the movies, read many of the books until it got to be overkill (thumbs down Kevin J. Anderson!), etc.  I enjoyed the Gennedy Tartarovsky ""Clone Wars"" series, although I feel that series focused too much on the darker part of Anakin's personality, preventing him from being likable; I can understand the reason for this, because some people would have a hard time with him becoming Vader in Ep. III if he was really likeable, but he was supposed to be a great hero.  When the Clone Wars movie came out, I passed on it, but gave the series a try.
  I haven't regretted it; the animation is excellent, with fluid movements and intense action scenes.  Many of the characters emote well and can be very lively, Mace Windu being one of the exceptions for some reason.  The battles are just as intense as the firefights and space battles from the original movies, with soldiers from both sides dying in large numbers and there being a lot of action.  The battle droids are humorous, and it has done a lot of development for all the characters; we see most of the Jedi  Council in action, Ahsoka grows up some, especially later on in the season where a battle costs her soldiers' lives.  Anakin is more of a daredevil warrior type, and comes off a lot more likeable than he does in the movies or GT's cartoon series, which I think fits better.  The half-flirty interactions between Obi-Wan and Ventress are interesting and a little unexpected, and General Grievous gets a pretty nice story arc that explains him and why he's now 90% droid; the interaction between Grievous and his ""Doctor"" were funny and I hope the Doctor shows up again.  The show also introduces one of the best new characters in the Star Wars Universe: bounty hunter Cad Bane.  This guy is great; from the moment he looks up from under his oversize hat and tells a Senate Guard ""Son, I wouldn't be doing that."", you know you're in for a very different type of underworld character that's effective, intimidating, and iconic.  Bane, far more than Ahsoka (who's ok, in an annoying teen sort of way), is the strongest character introduced so far, and hints at the darker future awaiting the galaxy.
  Despite my enjoyment of the series, there are a few things I don't like, and some discrepancies from the movies.  Some might be addressed in the Clone Wars movie, which I haven't  seen, but here the issues are:
  1.  While the lesson in the beginning of each episode is cute and reminds me of the ones at the end of many '80s cartoons, the newsreel is annoying.  The voice over for it is just way too overdramatic, which is a shame because it's the same guy who voices  the Admiral, who seems ok.
  2.  Count Dooku - I think he continues to be shortchanged in the series like he did in the movie; for starters, he lacks the Christopher Lee elegance when we've seen him thus far.  In addition, the whole galaxy seems to know he's a  Sith Lord now.  Even the Jedi didn't know that at the end of Ep. II.  When did that happen, and if it did, why doesn't anyone, including Sidious, call him Darth Tyrannus?  In addition, in Ep. II, Dooku tried to win over Obi-Wan by indicating he wanted to destroy the Sith and reform the Republic, which is allegedly becoming very corrupt.  Did he decide ""Ah heck, I'll just ditch that cover.""?  Because in the series he seems more focused on being sinister than anything else, and I think that removes the surface aspect of what the Clone Wars are about according to the movies and many of the books, which is the Separatists want to leave the Republic because it is corrupt and no longer governs well.
  3.  Relates to #2 in, ""what is the Separatist movement about?""  Like I stated before, the idea behind the Separatists are they want to leave the Republic because it has become corrupt and cannot run the galaxy, which gives Palpatine the excuse to gain more power and eventually transform the Republic into the Empire.  Based on the series, one would think the Separatists consist of 7 and a half (half being Grievous) living characters and a bunch of droids.  Ok, we know the head guys are greedy and evil, like the Viceroy and Grievous, but where's the Separatist viewpoint that leads Anakin to accuse Padme of sounding like a Separatist in Ep. III?  It would be interesting to see Separatists that aren't totally evil or see some obvious (Palpatine/Sidious isn't obvious) examples of Republic corruption in the series.
  4.  Like a few others have complained, there is no indication of a friendship between Bail Organa and Obi-Wan Kenobi.

  Overall though, I think the series is an excellent addition to the Star Wars universe and does a lot for connecting the bridge between Ep. II and Ep. III, and is enjoyable to watch.  I recommend it.",1263600000,,4845,4.5619930475086905

 Having said all that, season one is still the show testing waters, and finding its place ( season 2 has been better, and more consistent with the way its been told) the animation is great, and the stories are for the most part good, but there are a few hit and miss ones there.

3752178,4,B001PO53IO,"I enjoyed this series but I find the packaging pretty flawed, in our local Australian version we have the art booklet seperate & a bluray case inside of a slipcase & details about the show printed on the back of the slipcase, easy to preserve everything. Whereas with the american version the artbook is integrated inside with the blurays and there's a cardboard slip (which shows what the shows about, what the special features are, etc) glued very lightly on the back since its supposed to look like a book I guess. This sheet of cardboard on the back also has an annoying thing that bends over the packaging to the front and the only way this makes any sense is for the buyer looking at it in shrinkwrap form, once its open its like they want you to throw out the cardboard even though it contains what I think is the most important information. And once its out of shrinkwrap there's no way to close it back up since its made in a book design, chuck it in an ordinary bag and it'll easily open itself, potentially damaging your discs & bending all the pages of the intergrated artbook

Honestly to fix everything all it needed was a slipcase & a seperate artbook if we want to give it to the kids or something. At least Australia knows what its doing whereas America always seems to get the worst packaging (like Futurama Bender's Big Score that wasn't even in a proper dvd case, just some flimsy cardboard that got broken within days).

This is a mixed bag at best.  There are a handful of episodes that I would watch again -- the first one featuring Yoda dispensing classic Jedi wisdom; one with clones working well as a team; and one of the series in the middle.  Several feature Jar-Jar Binks as the ""hero"" and are complete garbage.  One implausible series puts Obi-Wan and Anakin face-to-face with Count Dooku.  This at least presents intriguing dialogue opportunities, but they are totally wasted.  The worst of all comes near the end, where the biotoxin-manufacturing villain is a poor caricature of Joseph Goebbels, complete with German accent and jack boots.  Not only was this boring and trite, it scared my kids out of their wits.

Probably the best overall feature of this series is the music:  there are some really nice, novel instrumentational flourishes interspersed among the episodes.  Too bad the plot/dialogue isn't comparably compelling.

To be honest, at first I thought the execution was kind of poor.  Some of the characters don't emote well and the animation can be kind of stiff.  However, after diving in head first I came to appreciate it for what it is: mindless enjoyment.  I guess I don't know else to expect going in to a Star Wars animated television series.  I enjoyed many of the episodes better than a lot of the prequel movies themselves.  There are episodes that show sides of the Star Wars universe that isn't seen that often.  There is one particular episode dedicated entirely to rookie clone troopers stationed on a remote planet and we get to see how they deal with a desperate situation.  The show looks amazing on Blu-Ray.  The worlds and landscapes are vivid and are very well designed.  The bonus features such as commentaries by the makers of the show are interesting and the packaging is even neat becuase it is a booklet of concept art for the show.

For those of you that haven't seen either the show or the movie, the plot is set in between the last three movies and the original three movies during a time called the Clone Wars.  The show is not too violent for younger kids and does not show blood.  The animation is top rate and enjoyable for adults who like the original movies.  This is good quality family viewing for everyone.  My kids love watching the episodes over and over again which makes owning the entire season well worth the $30-$40.

The series has been a great way of introducing Star Wars to my young sons, but I brought the Blu-ray of season one for me...and I've enjoyed sitting down by myself to watch this great-looking, entertaining and superbly cinematic show. TRESPASS and HOSTAGE CRISIS were, for me, the highlights, though a high standard is maintained over all 22 episodes (even, amazingly, the ones 'starring' Jar Jar).

3752220,5,B001PO53IO,"I may be one of the few who actually enjoyed the prequel trilogy, so before I begin let me provide a brief bit of insight. I was 7 years old when ""Star Wars"" (which would eventually become Episode 4: A New Hope) was released theatrically. I saw that film SEVERAL times in 1977.
Anyway as a piece of entertainment the season one collection of The Clone Wars is very well done. Yes it is a cartoon and the series runs on the cartoon network, but I think it finds a nice balance of staying true to the basic aspects of the films and being suitable for kids without putting adults to sleep. The storylines are complex and offer insight into aspects of the overall narrative (the clones as individuals, a look at other Jedi, and even an examination of the bad guys) that help support episode 3.

The animation work is superior to most broadcast cartoons (as would be expected from Lucasfilm) and has a certain style visually that works for this series( yes if you are a fan of Pixar and Dreamworks animated features you will complain about certain aspects like the fact that hair doesn't behave in a manner that you may have come to expect, but these people where going for a different objective)

Now please DO NOT BE FOOLED! I am supporting the animated series, not the animated ""film"" Clone Wars that was released a few months prior to the series which makes up this box set. I think it was a wise choice that the producers have kept the two VERY seperate.

Visually the animation looks great, I have a PS3 and the discs play with no problems, the sound is great as would be the case with anything from the ""Star Wars"" world. Blu-ray is the format of choice for this box set, but even if you have a regular dvd play I am sure The Clone Wars set would look fantastic! My one overly fan boy comment would be that it would have been interesting if Lucas had made episode 3 but HELD on to it until after this series had run (let's all be honest, the film would have made good money even if it was release in 2012) it may have made the overall story stronger.

 If you can appreciate it Clone Wars series for what it really is (a chance to expand upon a story that wasn't really given a fair chance to be told from the start) then you will be pleasantly surprised with this box set. I think it is a perfect addition to any big or little kids Star Wars video collection.",1260316800,,2362,4.298876404494382

3752223,4,B001PO53IO,"Star Wars, ever since I've been a kid, has taken my life and flipped it right-side up. The mesh between drama, action and science fiction has such a unique quality only someone as brilliant as George Lucas could create. I'm proud that he has expanded his universe from as far as toys to video games so his fans can cherish more and more wonderful moments. Every movie and every comic book introduces numerous amounts of characters. One in 'general' catches my eye...

Now Lucas has produced and supervised something revolutionary for Star Wars: a show that runs daily. I have to admit, I had wished Lucas would put the 'Clone Wars concept' to rest and make the show's time-line during the Empire's time, but I decided to let it go, seeing one of my favorite characters in the trailers.

I watched the show and was fairly impressed. Every episode held the same great writing that smooths along the bread that is the Star Wars universe. Lucas had said before that he had wanted to introduce new characters, as well as dive into less-famous ones. In fact, in ""The Clone Wars'"" 22 episodes, the show spread all over the galaxy, exploring new worlds and characters. That being said, I can now honestly say that I did not look forward to any new planets, new weapons or new characters. I looked forward for someone in particular.

The DVDs by itself is well worth the buy, oozing with special features and commentary most die-hard Star Wars fans like myself will be drooling over. It has even been released in Blu-Ray, offering a richer and more visually-appealing experience for fans willing to cough-up an extra $20-or-so. I've covered the show, how great it is and what the DVD has to offer. Now I'll discuss the main reason why I even bother with this show, and Star Wars, in the first place.

*THE FOLLOWING IS MY OPINION EXCLUSIVELY OVER THE MANAGEMENT OF MY FAVORITE CHARACTER*

Throughout the Star Wars saga, I've had my share of obsessions over Star Wars' many bad-asses: Boba Fett, Darth Vader, Durge! But no one captures my imagination as much as the one and only General Grievous does. Since his first epic entrance in the cartoon series, I've wanted to see him more and more. In his first appearance, his character is portrayed as a military genius capable of wielding, at the most, 5 lightsabers at a time (4 in each arm and one in his foot)! Grievous was head-strong, practically unstoppable and annihilated everything in his path.

Along with the cartoon series, George Lucas was preparing the final missing chapter: Episode III. Figuring that Grievous would be a confirmed character, I'd stay up all night sketching battle-scenes and wondering how many Jedi's sabers Grievous could add to his collection. But, to my disappointment, Episode III came out with half of Girevous. He still had the same visually-appealing look and an even-cooler commanding voice, but he was so toned-down his awesomeness was nearly transparent.

It made me question logic. Surely Lucas saw Grievous in the cartoons, which came at least a year or two before the movie. Couldn't Lucas keep consistency? It broke my nerdy heart to see Grievous hacking up hairballs for his 30 minutes of screen-time. Or maybe Genndy Tartakovsky, the creator of the cartoons, should have made Grievous less over-powered so he hadn't given people high expectations and anger fans such as myself?

Regardless, I looked forward to watch Clone Wars. I looked forward for Grievous to be redeemed and to finally be able to brag to my friends about how many faces he'd step on. Then things just got from bad to worse.

Grievous was introduced in the season's second episode (I won't go on to spoil anything for people who have yet to see it) and I wanted to literally beat the snot out of Lucas. Now, more than ever, Grievous fits into the tiers of bumbling droids. He's clumsy, he's 'fleeing' by the end of every episode he stars in, and he might have to be treated with the best anger-management courses offered in the galaxy.

Not only that, but Grievous was only featured in 7 out of the 22 episodes. Now obviously, he can't be in every single one, but you'd think that the Separatist's ""Supreme Commander"" would be present in major battle situations that the show is revolved around (it is the Clone ""Wars""). Also, Lucas and his 'expanding universe' might be on the verge of buckling under its own weight. With fans contributing their own pieces of history to Star Wars every year, timelines grow confusing. Anything not officially confirmed is just rejected and labeled as 'canon' (even Genndy Tartakovsky's cartoons stray away from story lines already established). But now, Clone Wars has the right to expand. It 'needs' to if it wishes to hold up against other Cartoon Network programs. I'm not necessarily angry at the show itself, I just wish a show that promises expansion and character-development would stop being narrow-minded and focus on characters already established. Grievous, for instance.

*I'M DONE RAMBLING LIKE AN ANGRY NERD. THE REST IS PURELY OVER REVIEW ON THE DVD BOX SET*

Getting to the real point, the show is great and has a good reason for being so successful. It's thought-out well and offers new bedtime stories for the kiddies this show was intended for. Everyone has their place: the Jedi are the heroes, the droids and Grievous are the victims of their success.

As for Grievous, this has been the 'second' time Star Wars has failed to realize it's full potential with their murder-crazed, psychotic cyborg. Nevertheless, I can only tell myself four simple words that help me sleep better: ""There's always season two.""",1260057600,6,5619,4.828482328482329

Whether a space battle against an enormous battleship, or a down-to-earth fight as droids infiltrate a clone stronghold the show manages to tell good stories in a short amount of time.

The show keeps to the atmosphere of the films with their virtues and flaws.  There are amazing alien worlds and fantastic technology.  But there is some juvenile humor with the droids and an annoyingly perky teen Jedi but overall it is a strong product.

The box set deserves special mention, not only is the packaging great but it includes a sketch book filled with art.  Most of the episodes include a 'making of' feature and many have an extended director's cut.

Watching the individual episodes without the commercial break fade-outs and no Cartoon Network logo printed onscreen is the BEST way to see these wonderful shows!  Each episode has a corresponding featurette that outlines the production of that episode.  There is a booklet of arwork affixed to the center of the DVD case that affords a cool look into the storyteller's minds.

My only complaint is:  I LOVE behind the scenes materials!  I would've really enjoyed something that showed even MORE aspects of their production... sculpting maquettes, scanning them, animation nodes, storyboard to digital comparisome... I can think of so much more I'd have loved to have seen... sniff... sob... I guess I can't have it all.

It's a great pleasure to have the entire season at fingertip's grasp.  I was disappointed at the decision to release the episodes in individual DVD's containing a few episodes each.  I don't know how Lucasfilm made out on that decision, but I refused to buy them in that format and waited, hoping the entire season would be released as a whole.

The Clone Wars must have inspired some kind of wonder ever since Mark Hamill mentioned it in a brief line in the first original movie. Even though it's briefly shown in the prequel films and a cool little cartoon made in 2003, there is still a lot to explore.

Following the 2008 CGI Clone Wars movie, this show features the same funky blocky characters and semi-artistic rendering, but it seems to be of higher quality. Lighting effects, animation movements, lip movements, and action scenes overall seem much improved from the pilot film. More importantly, with multiple story lines to follow, the series offers better stories with deeper issues and stronger characters (characters ranging from the main heroes Anakin, Yoda, Obi-Wan, etc to the lesser known characters like Aayla Secura, Plo Koon, Kit Fisto, etc). The show has loads of great action scenes and high-quality effects. There are adventures on many different worlds (once again, some well-known like Naboo, Coruscant, etc to lesser-known ones like Iego), each offering imaginative design and impressive imagery. Production design (sets, props, costumes, vehicles, weapons, etc) matches the Star Wars universe and fits in perfectly; fans should be able to recognize a huge number of familiar elements, mixed in with cool new stuff. Music is not bad. All together, it's an awesome show that fits nicely in the franchise.

This disc set features perfect PQ; I could not find any faults with it whatsoever. It's very sharp and clean, with excellent color and contrast. It is presented in an aspect ratio that is wider than the original broadcast version, providing more of the image to be seen.  Sound quality is acceptable (Dolby Digital 5.1), but as a lossy soundtrack, it's not as clean as it could have been, and lacks impact (despite the show's cool sound design). This set includes some cool extras (featurettes, a database feature, trailers, etc). It comes in a large, thick, rather nice digibook-type package with some cool production art inside.",1258588800,4,2101,5.126099706744868
3752232,4,B001PO53IO,"I was very excited when I first read these were coming out as a box set on Blu Ray, but the original price many retail outlets were advertising made me cringe.  Thankfully, Amazon came along at nearly half the price!  Since I pre-ordered, these were at my door the day it came out.  I'm with many out there that are annoyed by having a HD TV and outside of football, rarely get to enjoy the quality it was made to bring in my viewing experience. Cartoon Network does not have HD for these where I am, so this set was a treat.  I missed many of the earlier episodes as well, so I also got to do some catch up.

Episodes like ""Ambush"", ""Hostage Crisis"" and the whole ""Ryloth"" trilogy make these alone a must own for any true fan of the series, or Star Wars.  Yes, like any show, there are weak episodes (all the Jar Jar episodes (three of them) are even more annoying because they know the disdain so many fans have for this character, yet for some reason ""King George"" thinks it cute to shove him down people's throats).  But overall, there are so many quality episodes and plotlines that you can't even get irriated by the handful of weak episodes on these discs.  The extras are top notch, as are the animation and blu ray experience.",1258502400,,1235,4.316017316017316
3752233,4,B001PO53IO,"First of all, I should say I LOVE this series.  There is nothing like it on TV, and once again Star Wars is breaking new ground.  The show is quality.  It can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike.  The graphic design of the settings and characters is beautiful, and the story lines are thoughtful  and interesting.  As an added bonus, you get to see some characters and species from the Star Wars universe come to life.  I particularly enjoyed seeing the IG-88-type assassin droids in action and Aurra Sing in one episode.

As a lot of reviewers have said, the Blu-Ray format is a must here.  Simply dazzling.

Now comes the ""BUT...""  There were a few things that I think could be improved upon.

3D animation: The movement of the characters is not always fluid or natural-looking.  I think they claim to have improved upon this for Season 2.  Some of the lip-syncing doesn't look particularly great, either.  I have seen some examples of improvement in this arena in Season 2, as well.  In at least one episode, I spotted a glaring rendering error in which you could see through Padme's head from the back.  I was amazed the error wasn't caught and corrected.

Writing:  A couple episodes dragged a little.  There were also a few plot holes, such as Anakin and Obi-Wan cleverly swapping away their drugged drinks at the end of one episode, but then finding themselves waking from a drugged coma in a holding cell at the beginning of the next episode.  Did I miss something???

Voice acting: Some of the character voices sounded like they were done by real amateurs.  Ahmed Best played Jar-Jar in one episode, and then in the next Jar-Jar episode it sounded like they pulled someone in off the street.  I swear, I can do a better Jar-Jar impersonation than the person who played him in the ""Gungan General"" episode.  I should mention that the actor who did the clone voices was exceptional.  He modified the voice ever so slightly from clone to clone, so they don't all sound exactly alike.

Annoying/campy characters:  I didn't hate Jar-Jar as much as everyone else in the prequels.  Sure, he was a bumbling idiot, but his bumbling usually ended up accidentally generating positive results.  I could overlook that.  The Clone Wars will make you HATE Jar-Jar if you don't already.  His goofiness ends up destroying ships, killing a senator, and costing the Republic victory on several occasions.  You have to ask yourself, ""WHY ON EARTH would you bring him along anywhere???""  Throw him in prison, and the Republic can win the war in a week.

The spinning flying-saucer ship of the pirates and the cliche evil scientist/mad doctor were just a couple examples of George Lucas getting a little too nostalgic for Saturday morning serials at the expense of this series.

I think all of these flaws can be excused and remedied as the series progresses.  Overall, the show is beautiful and brilliant.  Can't wait to see more.",1258502400,3,2918,4.716269841269841

To think all this started when Sir Alec Guinness <spelling-sorry!) said one little sentence mentioning something about ""yeah, I was a Jedi Knight during the Clone Wars!"" to a very young Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker! Right where Episode 2 stops, this excellent, high quality computer animated series fills in alot of gaps and information as to who all the major players are, both good and evil! Damn, alright when is Season 2 comin' out! You the Fan/Viewer get a more comprehensive understanding of Anakin Skywalker and how much ""good"" and compassion there is in him! LUCASFILMS can go 9 season of this, with a ""War"" of this scale, there should be enough material to carry it off! You really get a good sense of commradery with the Clone Troopers, the other Jedi Knights, the dumbass bumbling JJBinks(comedy relief) the sultry/evil asaj ventriss, the mix of the politics, this whole adventure is really well written, the voice actors have their ""Star"" counterparts down to a ""T!""

3752235,4,B001PO53IO,"This set collects the 22 episodes that comprise the first season of Star Wars: The Clone Wars. It follows the theatrical pilot, available separately as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-The-Clone-Wars-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B001GQSY5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars: The Clone Wars (Widescreen Edition)</a>. Each adventure recounts the dramatic battles of the Clone Wars that take place between Episodes II and III of the movie saga.

I had skipped season one during its initial broadcast - having caught the theatrical movie and not being impressed - but after watching through this set, I'm quite pleased with the results. What wasn't quite theatrical quality animation is in contrast leaps and bounds above conventional TV animation. This is some eye-popping stuff here - even accounting that Lucasfilm probably shelled out a bit more than your average TV budget, there are epic space battles, intricate Lightsaber duels, new planets and characters, and more. It's Star Wars, and it feels right. The stories are a mix of singular installments and two or three-part sagas. In a fun convention, each episode begins with a serial-style recap, regardless of whether or not there actually was a direct preceding installment. You can pretty much jump in at any point in the season and be up to speed.

What doesn't work? The Battle Droids remain chatty and Jar Jar still makes you want to turn your TV off. Ahsoka Tano ends up faring much better than she did in the theatrical pilot - more eager apprentice and less ""Sky Guy"" arrogance. Really, the series' biggest fault is that ultimately, little of consequence can actually happen - the majority of characters meet their fate in Episode III, and as pointed out in the bonus features, Anakin and General Grevious can't actually meet face-to-face. The best stories revolve around the Clone Troopers or aspects of the war that don't directly involve trying to end it.

This is a nicely produced DVD set - there is an attached booklet of concept art from the show, and each episode comes with a mini featurette that has cool production tidbits. I did find the set somewhat expensive - the Canadian sale price is higher than the American MSRP, so Americans are really getting a deal with this one.

The series absolutley SCREAMS Star Wars.  It has all the things we all thought were cool about the movies.  And it is made by fans of Star Wars, which is a plus.  They stay true to the universe.  The bonus features are awesome as well.  I was, like I am sure a lot of fans, a little hesitant that animated SW could be good, but this is good.  Granted the droids are a little too dumb, but I can get over that.  This is good entertainment.",1257897600,5,583,4.125
3752238,4,B001PO53IO,"This set is really well-designed.  Better even than the SW film sets.  The case itself is more like a book with the DVDs attached to the inside front and back of the cover.  In the middle are pages of production illustrations from the show including a few spoiler illustrations from Season 2.  The set feels like a nice hardcover book, not a cheap DVD keepcase.

The extras are plentiful.  So far I've only had time to watch the first disc but every episode has a six-to-ten minute featurette specifically geared to that episode.  I prefer that to the generic featurettes and EPK materials usually included with TV series discs.  In addition, many of the episodes include additional materials.  But best of all, all of these episodes are in widescreen format, 2.35:1!  Even wider than the original Cartoon Network HD showings in 1.78:1.  This really helps the cinematic qualities of the show shine through.

As to the show itself, it's never looked better.  LFL has created some of the best transfers ever for this set.  The episodes themselves are mostly entertaining and get better as the season progresses.  Early on I found myself a bit annoyed with the Ahsoka character but I could imagine that children would find her interesting.  The production staff seems to have been trying to walk a very thin line between the tone of the SW films and the new ""kiddie"" audience this show was bound to attract.  They went down a few dead ends but by the end of the season it felt like they had found their way.  I look forward to all that season two promises.",1257811200,4,1553,4.647058823529412

3752242,4,B001PO53IO,"I distinctly remember seeing STAR WARS (sorry, kids, it's NOT called ""A New Hope""!) in 1977 when I was 10 years old.  I've been a fan ever since. I was disappointed in the prequels, but loved the animated shorts on the Cartoon Network, so I had my hopes up for this series. The theatrical film was fairly bad - had it been released as part of the tv series, it would have been the weakest story arc of the season. But these episodes are GREAT! Good, old-fashioned, Star Wars fun: Good guys vs. bad guys, space battles, droids, lightsabers and blasters.

Only two things keep this from being a 5-star item: 1. The short length of the half-hour episodes sometimes makes them seem a bit rushed; and 2. Why is it that the female jedi (with one exception) have to run around in not much more than a bathing suit, while the male jedi are covered from head to toe in robes, armor, and gloves? It might be  nice if they brought a few female character and costume designers on-board to make things a little more equitable.

These, are minor quibbles, though.  All-in-all, my 9-year-old son and I love to watch this series together, and we hope that Lucas sees it through to at least 100 episodes, as he has said he'd like to do.",1257552000,3,1219,4.4

3752245,5,B001PO53IO,"I know, sounds like an exageration, but believe me. This is the finest box set you will ever experience. This is what Blu-Ray is about folks. Fantastic surround sound that encompasses the entire sound field, flawless dialogue tracks, and thunderous bass. Dear God, Star Wars was meant to sound like this. Digital clarity that only Blu-Ray can provide.

Our cable company has yet to add Cartoon Network to our HD roster, so what a pure joy to finally see this beautiful animation come to life in all of its glory. The episodes are simply glorious. The colors, the lighting, the depth, the dimension, I just can't believe anyone would say something negative about this presentaion.

The packaging is fantatsic as well. Built solid, with amazing texture, and beautiful booklet with early images of the charecters, planets, and crafts, along with fun comments about each. The discs are held in place quite nicley, and the whole set just reflects Lucas perfection!

The special features are so in depth, and fascinating. My 7 year old son and I just loved hearing the backstories and realizing how much care goes into every aspect of the charecters and storylines. I know some people just don't accept this new generation of Star Wars. Well, you know what. Thats their loss!

I have come to love these charecters, and they are handled with intergrity from the writers. The episode ""Rookies"" is one of the most moving stories I have seen in many years. These clones do have personalities, and you hurt for them as they mature and try to fullfill their ""purpose"". Yoda is a pure joy in ""Ambush"", as he takes on a challenge to defeat a legion of battledroids, while helping 3 clone troopers learn more about who they are, and how to use the force in their own unique way. Plo Kloon also shows his compassion for the clones as he risks his own life in space to save their lives because of how much he values them. The special connection between Anakin and R2 is also explored, as well as his genuine care for Asoka (his young padawan).

My son and I love Captain Rex, and Asoka, and really enjoy the appearances by Aurra Sing, Kit Fisto, Plo Koon, Aayla Secura, and so many other fun charecters we only catch little or no glimpse in the films. We are both so psyched for what has been rumored to be Boba Fett's appearance in season 2!

If you are a fan of the series, this is simply a must have. If you have been turned off from the series from all of those...well, you know what I mean. Forget them and give it a try. FINALLY, a box set worth every penny!!!!!!!!!",1257379200,35,2555,4.555555555555555
3752246,5,B001PO53IO,"The sound and picture quality on these disks is amazing. I'm truly blown away by it on my 1080p tv. Also, the aspect ratio of these episodes is different than the broadcast versions. On tv they cut off part of the sides, even though it is presented in widescreen on tv. The blu-ray episodes have an aspect ratio closer to the Films.

I'm really enjoying the extras they go into a lot of detail and explain some really cool things. Also, some of the bad (jar jar and fart jokes). The best part of the special features is getting to see clips from the films in 1080i for the first time. I Cannot wait for that blu-ray boxset! The Jedi Archives special features are really enjoyable too but for the concept art you can't select things to zoom on which stinks if you have a small tv. Even on my 42"" some things are still too tiny to see as big as I would like.

The box everything comes in is top quality too. It's kind of like the whole thing is a book you open it up there's production notes and concept art in a booklet attached to the case. Disk 1 is on the front and the back has Disks 2 and 3 stacked on each other (like many boxsets do these days).

Overall it's a fantastic set that does exactly what it should. I wish there was a full commentary for the episodes but getting a 7min featurette per 20 minute is a good replacement. Also, i wish there were full behind the scenes features not just ones for specific episodes. But they have all of that on the Clone Wars movie set so it's understandable. Hopefully the Season Two set includes those kinds of things.

- PS: my first set came with Disk 1 and 2 copies of Disk 2. But Amazon sent me the replacement and i got it within 24 hours so no harm done.",1257292800,12,1708,4.151057401812689

I'm not begrudging him this. After all, Lucas has stated numerous times that *this* is what Star Wars is meant to be. I loved the original trilogy ... when I was a kid. As an adult, I see the flaws in each of the first three films. Especially ROTJ, whose Ewoks were so clearly family-centric.

So good on Lucas for achieving this. My 5 y.o. loves this series, and I can see why: the iconic-looking clones, the lightsaber-weilding Jedi, the two-dimensional bad guys you love to hate, space battles, unusual aliens ... it's a child's playland full of colorful characters and just a little bit of complexity.

I have seen the movies dozens of times and still remember seeing the original at the drive in (!) in 1977 all summer long.  I've read all the best Star Wars books (*cough*TimothyZahn*cough*), played most of the games, have all the music on my ipod and saw Episode III at midnight.  Yea, I'm a fan.  Episode 1 and 2 didn't do it for me, but EP3 brought Lucas back into my good graces.

Despite being a hard core fan, I refused to see a Star Wars cartoon in a movie theater.  Rubbish! I declared.  How can Star Wars be a blocky cartoon?

That was a mistake.  When I finally got the movie on DVD, it was fantastic.  When this show came out on Cartoon Network, finally, for the first time in YEARS I had a Sci Fi show that I actually looked forward to watching each week.  Yes, its a cartoon.  Yes, I would prefer a live action show or another movie, but I know that is later and never (respectively).  Yes, it could be geared a little more toward adults (but then BattleStar Galactica was so much geared toward adults, that I couldn't watch it.  Its softcore porn wrapped in a swearfest, served with torture and gore... oh goody.  Lorne Greene is spinning in his grave...) but in the end, just about every episode of Clone Wars is memorable, with little to no filler.

Parts of it are recycled, some of the scenes are almost stolen right from the movies, but it works, it works, it works.  And there is enough new material to overlook the recycled parts.  I like the quips, I like the new Padawan and the action scenes are fantastic.

I don't give away 5 stars easily.  And if you're turned off at my comments about ""BS"" Galactica and think your shows need more porn and gore, not less, you might be turned off a bit at Clone Wars.

After EP3, I thought I would never get a chance to invest my imagination in the Star Wars universe again, but Clone Wars proved me dead, dead wrong.

EDIT - My review is based on having seen every episode.  Now that I've got the DVD set, I am even more impressed!  There is a 64 page book in the middle of the DVD's with concept art from the show and its very nice.  The case is not cheap, its more like a book itself.  I'm guessing that they will eventually offer a nice book shelf container for holding all the seasons when it is done.

This is what Star Wars is all about action adventure humor and just having a good time.  This show was far better than I imagined I was very skeptical but it surpassed my expectations.  George Lucas said he is going to make 100 episodes of this show so about 5 Seasons so if you are a Star Wars fan it's a good time right about now.

I've read at least 100 Star Wars books, and a great many of the games. I realize there is a lot of crap under the banner of Star Wars. But... this series is a horrendous abomination.

The dialogue is beyond horrendous, and makes the most awkward ""love"" scenes in Episode II feel like the work of Shakespeare by comparison. It's worse even than typical children's' shows in that while it's obviously aimed for children, it's still unbelievably terrible, and so full of stupid puns and tired expressions and dull monotonous recitation of lines that I imagine even the target audience would be bored with these sequences, and fast forward through all but the battle scenes.

Jar Jar Binks is rendered pleasant in comparison to this Padawan girl that Anakin is inexplicably given to train (Jedi Knights do not train Padawans; only Masters) whose entire role consists of generic ""tough girl"" sassy quips and ridicule.

The 3D animation is what you'd expect from a LucasFilms budget, but perhaps to keep themselves linked with the much more successful Clone Wars micro-sodes by Genndy Tartakovsky, they retain the stupid shapes of people's heads that consists of various juxtapositions of gravity-defying squares, circles, and polygons. Count Dooku's beard looks like the triangular front-piece of an old-time freight train, and it looks stiff as metal, too.

The battle scenes would certainly be the highest appeal for children, but for the non-children watcher, even those are usually made a mess by the constant stale quips and jabbering between Obi-Wan and Anakin and That Annoying Girl being spoken/yelled at one another throughout an entire sequence.

General Grievous is just as useless and nonthreatening a villain as he was in the movie, and the droid shenanigans that are apparently meant to be ""humorous"" are jacked up tenfold from the movie, and ten times less cute/funny.

Obviously the point of this series is to make an open-ended source of stories, no matter how stale or hackily written, to be exploited for episode fodder and money.",1253664000,23,2209,4.989130434782608

3752267,4,B001PO53IO,"...Star Wars - Clone Wars, the epic events we finally get to witness after hearing about it in the 1977 release of Episode IV A New Hope.  The years have passed since 1977 and one could only speculate what the Clone Wars were about.  The theatrical releases of Episode II and III gave us a bit more insight as to what they were like at the end of the Clone Wars and at the beginning of the Galactic Empire.  But in this modern-day mythology we get to dive in to the heart of the Clone Wars and see the line running between Episode II and Episode III something they don't explain well in the movies is that much time passes between each.

...Star Wars - Clone Wars is a brilliantly stylized and developed animated television show, which allows you to submerse yourself into the Star Wars Universe and take part in a separate adventure each episode.  In each episode you get to explore the personalities and relationships of Jedi, the Clone Troopers, as well as the Villains and see how they interact with one another.

...George Lucas set up the rules and universe in which these characters live in, but it's good to see how other artists and story tellers put their own ideas together to bring us this great series and allow the mythology of Star Wars to live slightly out of the hands of George Lucas.",1252972800,6,1302,4.449579831932773
3752268,5,B001PO53IO,"Don't bad on me for posting a review before the product is released. Amazon is so bad at informing of bonus features I thought some might want to know what this Blu-Ray (or DVD) set will include.

This is from the press release (which also notes the release date as 3 Nov.):

Star Wars: The Clone Wars The Complete Season One is presented in widescreen with English, Spanish and French 5.1 DTS audio and English, French and Spanish subtitles.

Bonus features include:

* Seven Director's Cut Episodes: Rising Malevolence, Shadow of Malevolence, Lair of Grievous, Rookies, Storm Over Ryloth, Innocents of Ryloth and Liberty on Ryloth

* 22 Episodic Featurettes that go behind-the-scenes with Supervising Director Dave Filoni and crew about the making-of each episode

* Spectacular 64-page production journal that includes early sketches, artist notes, and concept art from each episode from Season One

* Blu-ray Exclusive -- The Jedi Temple Archives: An extensive database exploring test footage, early concept art, 3-D character and object turnarounds and early animation. The Archives is a rare look at the assets in various stages of creation for The Clone Wars, with a wealth of surprises and never-before seen moments sprinkled throughout.

UPDATE: Now I have the set and can add that the disks are Region Free (I play them on my European BD player) and are encased in a book cover with a 62-page book. The front flap holds disk 1 and the back flap holds disks 2 and 3. The book is 64 pages (including front and back cover) of amazing artwork and behind-the-scenes pictures, scans, script pages, info, background, character drafts, etc for the entire first season. I hope some body uploads some scans or photos to the product page so you can see the detail. It is excellent! I can't believe they included so much in this set for such a low price.

The packaging is well done allowing disk removal without scratching. Each disk holds 7 or 8 episodes, which run back-to-back as one long movie (however with the ""Clone Wars"" logo and news real preceding each).

The bonus features are similar to Seinfeld's ""Inside Look"" features where each episode is dissected - in this case mostly by director Dave Filoni with an occasional guest - either a writer or producer. There aren't picture-in-picture tracks, everything is done as stand-alone featurettes - one for each episode. There are hidden content within each featurette where you can hit the ""enter"" key on your remote at certain cued times to go into an animatic or design sketch, and then back where you left off.

The ""Directors Cut"" episodes aren't noticeably longer and scarcely different from the aired versions. I noticed a few seconds added here and there, mostly to action sequences (space battles, saber battles, etc). I doubt the casual viewer will notice any difference at all. The quality of both audio and video is exactly as I hoped - top notch!

Regardless: I can't recommend this set highly enough! It's such an amazing steal at this price and has a much bettter packaging than ROME or Battlestar Galactica which pretty much pissed me off! (You can't remove the disks in either of those box sets without scratching them since they are encased in cardboard sleeves with very shoddy casing!)

Aside: In a commentary for the last episode (featuring bounty hunters and a new character named ""Cad Bane"") director Filoni reveals that Zero the Hutt will be back in season two for a run of episodes and that we'll see more of the Hutts throughout the Cone Wars!",1250726400,134,3525,4.874581939799331
3752269,5,B001PO53IO,"WOW!  The Complete First Season of the new hit Star Wars The Clone Wars series is finally coming out soon!  My favorite episodes are Ambush, Rookies, and the Lair Of Grievous.  For some reason though, General Grievous only appears in not even half of this Season because Count Dooku kicked him out because Grievous can't even kill Kit Fisto when he broke into his lair.  Some of these episodes have some good authentic Star Wars moments, but for some reason, whenever Ahsoka Tano pops up, she ruins the moment!  I bet some Tano-haters probably wished that she died when she was infected by the Blue Shadow Virus.  I can't wait for Season Two!  However, I think the movie is better!",1250553600,3,681,4.625

8333954,4,B001PO53IO,"Ah, the Clone Wars. Ever since its first mention by Ben Kenobi in the original Star Wars film, these events have caused great intrigue among fans of the franchise. While ambiguous in its first mention, they were eventually elaborated upon in the 2002 film, Attack of the Clones. This led to numerous books, comics, and other expanded universe entries to further explain this great war  among these include the TV series created by Genndy Tartakovsky in 2003, Clone Wars. The 2003 Clone Wars (without The) was, in my opinion and many others opinions, an amazing show that used great visuals and animation to create an incredible Star Wars experience. While this newer series uses a very similar name and very similar character designs (except with 3D models), the shows are quite different in their tone. The original series was made up of short (two to twelve-minute) episodes that were later edited into two volumes on DVD, allowing for a fast-paced action-adventure series that was essentially Samurai Jack meets Star Wars (and I mean that in the best way possible). This series, however, is more like the typical animated series with 23-minute episodes that focus more on story and characters. Does it work? Well, it has its up and downs  Im going to start with the downs because I like to end on a high note.

 The biggest problem with this series is that it is clearly a show meant for children. While many of my favorite shows are technically childrens shows (such as Batman: The Animated Series and Avatar: The Last Airbender), they also work well for adults and thus, are more accurate to be labeled as all-ages. This show, despite its positive aspects that Ill touch on in a bit, is really just a kids show. Some parts of the show that clearly show this include the battle droids, Ahsoka the Padawan, and cringe-inducing dialogue. The battle droids are a problem because even though they are robots designed exclusively for the purpose of winning battles (who da thunk?), they come across as extremely annoying. They are constantly cracking jokes, usually about them losing the battle at hand, but these aren't funny and make it awkward when they are killed. Theyre supposed to be mindless robots that we don't care about, but when you humanize them like this (despite it being a poor humanization), you feel a little bad seeing the Jedi pulverize them without mercy. I wish the creators wouldve just had them not make these jokes, because then you wouldnt have these conflicting feelings or cringe moments. Also, the clone troopers aren't quite as bad, but have their moments, too  the most notable example is them calling the droids clankers, which is just silly. But wait, theres more annoying moments.

 Because this is a childrens show, they feel the need to have the young sidekick character who kids can relate to, this being Anakins new Padawan, Ahsoka Tano. While she does get better as the series goes along, the first half of this season portrays her as the stereotypical annoying sidekick character that adults hate, but from what Ive heard, she becomes a great character during the third season of the show, so we can look forward to that. The last major complaint relating to this being a childrens show is that the show has a lot of poor dialogue, which Ive mentioned already. With many episodes, the series will end with a character explaining to another character (usually Anakin to Ahsoka) an important moral, which usually just comes across as corny. These are the aspects of the show that annoy me the most, but there are still a couple more that annoy me, this time relating to the technical aspects.

 Firstly, look at the show; maybe it is just me, but I hate the design of the show. OK, so maybe I don't hate it because it does grow on you, but it really grinds my gears when a studio that isn't a major movie studio (like Pixar) tries to do 3D CGI-models. They almost always look awful and, truth be told, Ive always preferred traditional 2D animation. I think that in ten or so years, or with a bigger budget, this style of animating could really work on TV shows, but as of the production of this season (2008), it just didn't work. My final complaint is that the show has some editing problems. What I mean is that sometimes when transitioning to another scene, the fade away occurs just as a character finishes a sentence, giving us no pause time. This may seem minor, but minor problems like these are what pull you out of a show, so it was disappointing to see this problem pop up multiple times. But, I digress, as despite my complaints about the show, there are a lot of features the show does really well.

 The best part about this show is that, like many shows, it gets better as it goes along. While I wouldnt say that the second half is a masterpiece, it is noticeably better and I seemed to start enjoying the show a lot more after episode ten, Lair of Grievous. This episode is probably the best in the season, as it features a creepy atmosphere (two Jedi and a small squad of clones are trapped in the lair of General Grievous), characterizes General Grievous without telling us his whole life story (by mentioning that he chose his modifications to compete with the Jedi), and a great (albeit short) lightsaber battle between Kit Fisto and Grievous. The episode isn't amazing, but it is a substantial improvement over the previous episodes. As you may have noticed, I mentioned Kit Fisto, which is part of another strength for the show: its use of side characters.

 While most of the episodes focus on Anakin and Ahsoka (along with Obi-Wan sometimes), the series isn't afraid to have some episodes focus on lesser known characters in the galaxy. This works wonderfully because you end up with great episodes like the Lair of Grievous, but when you have subpar episodes focusing on Jar Jar, it is just one episode and that is it, which is nice. The series also has an ongoing storyline, being the Clone Wars, but most of the episodes are self-contained (with a few two or three-part episodes), which is great because the ongoing storyline keeps you engaged, but the individual plots make the replay value much greater. This style of storytelling is very similar to Avatar, which I think is great.

 Aside from what I previously mentioned, there are some other aspects that I very much appreciated. Firstly, people do die, which I think is wonderful because it helps to take away from the kiddie feeling of the show; one scene has a clone trooper get eaten by a giant worm-like creature and although it isn't gruesome at all, it did shock me a little. The series also features some fun banter between Anakin and Obi-Wan, which was one of my favorite parts of Episode III  this banter is most prominently featured in episode eleven, Dooku Captured. Speaking of their banter, the voice acting is mostly spot-on, especially with regards to the previously mentioned Jedi and Count Dooku, and fit their characters very well (Matt Lanter voices Anakin, James Arnold Taylor voices Obi-Wan, and Corey Burton voices Count Dooku). While most of the characters are enjoyable, I believe the breakout character is Cad Bane, who appears in the final episode as a ruthless bounty hunter. Im pleased to say that he is a recurring antagonist in the second season (from what Ive heard), as I think he stole the final episode.

 Ive talked about the good and bad, but do I recommend this show? If you plan on sticking with the show until the end, Im fairly certain that it will live up to its potential, as almost everyone agrees that this is the worst season, and it isn't even that bad; so yes, I recommend it. After finishing the season, I was pretty certain I would label it as a three-star show, since the good only just outweighed the bad when I was writing this, but then I realized something: I finished this season in less than a week and even though it had some painful moments, the time flew by for the most part. If time is flying by as I watch this, it must be better than I thought, and I attribute this to the fact that this is a Star Wars show, so even with its flaws, it has some enjoyment. A decent start to a show that Im hoping will meets it potential sooner rather than later",1502755200,,8227,4.646492434662998
