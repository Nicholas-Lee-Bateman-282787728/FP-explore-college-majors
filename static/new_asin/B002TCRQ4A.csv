3984389,5,B002TCRQ4A,"As someone who is intrigued by how our leaders chose to handle economic and social issues and their reasons behind doing so, I found this film very informative and interesting. I like that it is fairly short - easy to watch time-wise and kept my attention very well. I also appreciate that there are opposing opinions and this wasn't an all out ""Hoover was wonderful"" piece. I knew bits of a lot of what was covered in the film (hence my interest in watching), but also learned a great deal as well. Sadly, it is hard to get the true facts on anything political or historical, but I think this film was excellent!",1374364800,,613,4.433628318584071
3984390,4,B002TCRQ4A,Herbert Hoover is one of the handful of really good men who really deserves the presidency. This biography did well in detailing the life of our 31st President but the only thing that keeps me from giving it a five star rating is how short the film is.,1354147200,,252,4.270833333333333
3984391,5,B002TCRQ4A,"The economic factors during Hoover's presidency are well explained in this video.
Theories of modern macroeconomics did not exist then. This is an excellent review of the times.",1348012800,,177,5.357142857142857
3984392,2,B002TCRQ4A,"If your goal is to learn something about Hoover and his significance or insignificance on American History in under an hour this will work.  As part of the bargain you will have to endure a brief diversion while the filmakers criticize the Bush Administrations response to Katrina.  When budgeting 51 minutes for a biopic on an American president, one might think that unnecessary and distracting diversions would hit the editing room floor.  Not so in the case of ""Landslide"".  When discussing the Mississippi flood of 1927 we learn that Herbert Hoover was great.  Compare that to the Bush Administrations response to Katrina and, pay close attention boys and girls, Bush Bad.  We don't get the context of the response to Katrina.  We don't really get the context of the Mississippi flood either because we don't have time for that.  But we do have time to reinforce a negative political view of George Bush.  Even if we all agree that George Bush is Satan does it really seem appropriate to raise that here?  If it really were good technique to produce a biopic in this manner, then why not compare Hoover's support for Smoot Hawley to say Bill Clintons support for NAFTA?  You wouldn't.  It's a wholly unnecessary diversion and the decision to include it raises some doubt about the objectivity of the filmmakers.  Perhaps the hope is that this film will be shown to school kids where they can learn that, among other things, Bush Bad.

This biopic also suffers from too many talking heads.  Do we really need to hear from Herbert Hoover's great granddaughter?  She is cute and vivacious and even kind of looks like him but it seems her only true qualification is that the she is cute, vivacious and kind of looks like him.  She does add some sex appeal though.  That is probably the point.

Why not stick with the acknowledged experts on the subject, which thankfully we seem to have a few.  Robert Reich is not an acknowledged expert.  He has never produced any critically acclaimed work on this subject.  He is a noted liberal though and that is perhaps qualification enough.

By having a proliferation of talking heads we lose the individual character of their thought and ability to express it.  The idea of verbal prosody as an art is lost on the filmmakers.  This production puts more importance on jumping quickly from expert to expert as if staying in one place would cause the production to stagnate. Or, in the vernacular of the apparent target audience, high school kids, boring.  This seems like the technique of a action film or maybe even reality TV.  And in many cases one expert simply reiterates what another said.  Appropriate for learning I suppose, if you are a high school kid.

Guests that add sex appeal; action film and reality TV techniques!  It truly seems to have been made by and perhaps for High School kids, which is really disturbing given the filmakers taste for propaganda.",1314489600,12,2910,4.762
3984393,5,B002TCRQ4A,"This is an excellent well-rounded portrait of Hoover's life.  The film's length is just under 1 HR.  The production quality and attention to detail are all very high.  Various experts and academics are interviewed on camera - interwoven successfully with images and footage from Hoover's life.  The production, editing, music, etc. are all excellent - this is a quality production.
 The whole of Hoover's life is touched upon, from childhood through his years in office, even including a brief discussion of his 30+ years after he left the White House until his death in 1964.
I couldn't ask for a better 1 HR documentary film on the life of Herbert Hoover.  Recommended.",1311811200,,671,4.946428571428571
3984394,5,B002TCRQ4A,"This is the best DVD I have seen and used on Herbert Hoover in my college American Government and Recent American History classes.  It is a good representation of his whole life. He was a great humanitarian as demonstrated in this documentary.  I especially liked the narrative provided by a good cross section of the  speakers of different political views who placed Herbert Hoover into historical perspective. Robert Reich, David Kennedy, Margaret Hoover and Timothy Walch among others presented both a historical and personal view of Hoover. Topics covered included Iowa childhood,  Stanford education, mining career,  W.W.I relief, Commerce Secretary, 1928 election, Presidency, 1932 campaign & W.W.II relief plus Government Reform Commissions under Truman & Eisenhower. He was an activist through-out all of his government service especially very innovated contrary to common beliefs. The Mississippi Flood relief led by him in 1927 juxtaposed with Katrina relief was a great piece of commentary.  More information on Herbert Hoover and fly fishing and reference to the Rapidan presidential retreat would of been appreciated although both subjects given ample coverage in Richard Norton Smith's excellent C-Span DVD on the Hoover Presidential library which makes both DVD's complementary.",1266537600,,1293,5.639175257731959

When WWI caused Belgians to go hungry he aspired to feed them. He became Secretary of Commerce and stepped in to help people of the Gulf are during floods.

Elected President in 1928. When the 1929 Stock Market Crash occurred he nor anyone else knew exactly what to do which caused a malaise and unemployment. He loses the election and is run out of town. Insightful, was unaware.",1524441600,,529,4.627659574468085
8380053,5,B002TCRQ4A,This doc. about an American president who did great things before he was president .And when he became president he failed.,1484784000,,123,4.904761904761905
8380054,5,B002TCRQ4A,This was informative and very interesting account. I enjoyed it very much.,1454284800,,74,5.25
8380055,3,B002TCRQ4A,"Hoover is a far more interesting person than most Americans realize.  And this documentary isn't really going to do much to change that.  We find out Hoover was born, orphaned soon, managed to get into the first class at Stanford, then becomes a millionaire with about that much depth.  HOW??????  What about his work with the U.S. Food Administration during WWI?  How did he meet his wife?  The other PBS documentaries on presidents have been so well done--this one is a sad addition.

An additional note:  I was really surprised to see one of Hoover's descendants on the documentary.  Usually, relatives are only included for the personal side, and only if they knew the subject of the documentary.  Margaret Hoover isn't a historian or an economist or anything that should include her on a serious documentary.  I thought her inclusion was a surprising and pretty useless addition.",1393372800,,884,4.945578231292517
8380056,2,B002TCRQ4A,"""Landslide - A Portrait of President Herbert Hoover"" did not explain Herbert Hoover very well. Most of the DVD is various ""talking heads"", such as Robert Reich and David Kennedy. These are very intelligent and articulate people, but they mainly discuss what caused the Great Depression and other policy matters, not Hoover himself. They could have (probably have) produced a separate DVD on what caused the Great Depression. I was expecting something more about Hoover.

Hoover is widely recognized as a great humanitarian and public servant. But from the DVD I get little or no sense of Hoover as a person. The DVD was boring and over-general. Hoover remains a stiff, distant figure, just as he was before I viewed the DVD. I suspect there was more to Hoover.

The DVD does cover all of Hoover's life, but it seemed to me in a pretty superficial way. For example, his humanitarian work in WWI to feed the Belgians is somewhat covered, but I think a lot more details could have been provided, especially since this is what largely vaulted him to fame. Again, he became wealthy early as a mining engineer, but it is unclear from the video exactly how that happened. Obviously, they struck it rich somewhere, but the details are lacking.

I do not recommend this DVD.",1392336000,3,1265,4.767123287671233
8380057,4,B002TCRQ4A,This was very educational.  I hadn't giving that long ago president much thought until seeing this and understanding what type of person he was.,1390003200,,144,5.0
8380058,4,B002TCRQ4A,I never held President Hoover in high regard until watching this. I can much better appreciate his post-world-war efforts at resuscitating Europe.,1388880000,,146,5.681818181818182
8380059,4,B002TCRQ4A,"This documentary follows the career of president Herbert Hoover and explores the reasons why he was a failure in office.
It is fair and balanced account of how Hoover reacted to the Great Depression and how some critical decisions doomed his presidency. Hoover comes off as too stubborn and inflexible but he was clearly a good and decent man.
Well worth watching!",1386979200,,364,4.887096774193548
8380060,5,B002TCRQ4A,I chose this rating because it covered different aspects of Hoover than traditional history typically remembers. There was much more to this man than his challenges as the Great Depression progressed. Highly recommended.,1382832000,,220,5.696969696969697
8380061,4,B002TCRQ4A,"This was a good documentary that I would recommend to teachers, students, and history buffs. It touches on how he became president and why his presidency was ineffective.",1381968000,,170,5.107142857142857
