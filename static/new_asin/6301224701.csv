327083,4,6301224701,"Richard Wright is an important Afro American writer of the Harlem Renaissance. The movie is not as good as the book, however, for those who collect Afro American movies of this era, NATIVE SON is a 'must'.  Better still, purchase the book.  It is a classic in Afro American literature.",1208131200,2,285,4.68
327084,4,6301224701,"When originally released in Europe as Sangre Negra in 1950, Native Son - the film - was a long time coming for Wright.  The author had fought for the intergrity of his original novel enough to take up playing Bigger Thomas himself.  When released for American audiences as much as 30 minutes of film was left on the editing room floor.  It would be interesting to know what was left out, but one can make an educated guess.
For those of you who have read the novel this may not seem odd, but the main parts left out of the film have to do with misegenation (Bigger kissing Ms Dalton) and Communism (the word isn't even mentioned!!).  What is left is a dry husk of novel, but it leaves one to wonder what American audiences (or rather the censors) were ready to show in American theatres.
Several liberties were taken by the director (and Wright?) that may also prove interesting for further conversation.  Bessie, Bigger's one-dimensional love interest, is killed in the movie also, but it comes to the reader/viewer in a the form of a flashback in the prison scene (Fate).
Also, there is an interesting dream sequence where Bessie comes to Bigger like a Judas figure and Bigger runs through the cotton fields of his dream to his waiting father (Wassup with the cotton field, Rich!?).  Its refreshing to see his father appear in the dream sequence considering that its NOT in the book and Wright's father had left him at an early age.
Wright may have been an excellent though 'confused' writer, but he is NO actor!! I just imagined Bigger to be a little more thuggish than Wright could pull-off.  But he should get an E for Effort: Loosing 50 pounds to play the role, fighting to get the film made in Europe since he had Communism affiliations During the Macarthy trials, and just being an all around 'Daemonic Genius.'
I'd recommend the film for its extra-literary qualities.  If your teaching the novel, give your self a 90-minute break!!
But the Book is Better than the Film!!!",1001635200,19,1980,4.621082621082621
327085,2,6301224701,"Made on a shoestring in Europe, this filmization of Richard Wright's literary classic has little to recommend it in the way of production  values, yet it is of definite interest due to the casting of Wright himself  in the lead role of Bigger Thomas.  Already middle-aged at the time, Wright  is a good twenty years too old for the part and his skills as an actor fall  dramatically short of his talents as a writer.  Nonetheless, I can think of  no other ""serious"" author who has appeared on-screen in a film  version of one of his novels (Norman Mailer, of course, directed a movie  based on his ""Tough Guys Don't Dance""), and for that reason, this  otherwise amateurish version of ""Native Son"" ranks as a curio.  Admirers of the writer and his novel are not likely to be impressed by what  they see here but, approached as a novelty, this film is worth a look.",927590400,10,863,4.496774193548387
327144,1,6301224701,"This is a terrible copy of the movie!  It appears to be a poorly transferred copy (possibly from an OLD VHS) and the quality is awful!  Not only is the video terrible, the audio is too!  If I could give a negative rating, I would do so.  The movie deserves better as Richard Wright is one of the most visceral writers of the Harlem Renaissance.",1349136000,,344,4.246153846153846

327147,1,6301224701,I'm a big fan of the brilliant and historically important Richard Wright so it was with an extra degree of disappointment that I viewed this horribly transferred video and quickly decided to send it back. The quality is so bad that one wonders how it could even have been placed on the market for sale.,1322265600,,302,4.509090909090909

327149,5,6301224701,This was a good movie. I watched it and had my class answer questions about it as they viewed it and the entire class really enjoyed it.  They can remember several parts almost verbatim. A MUST for your American History Class.,1286236800,3,226,4.512195121951219

327151,5,6301224701,"Yes, the acting is amateurish, but no worse than Joan Crawford and Lana Turner melodramas with their stiff hairdos and exaggerated gestures...or monotone dialog in Humphrey Bogart type gangsta flicks of the 30's, 40's , and 50's...TV westerns or MAD MEN today! Just to make a movie like this in the 40's or 50's took a lot of courage which is why Hollywood didn't have the guts to do it.  Since black don't crack I saw no problem with Wright playing a much younger character. I'm 65 and easily look 20 years younger, according to my lying fans.  I've got  a gangsta NATIVE SON DVD, so why doesn't Oprah, Denzel, Halle or an uppity Negro in academia (like Henry Louis Gates) fund a legit copy on DVD?  What is the 1986 version like?  I never even heard of the remake until today while re-watching this classic film.",1266019200,3,814,4.510204081632653
327152,1,6301224701,This looks like a very bad VHS transfer.  The visual and audio quality are horrendous!  You'd do better to wait for TCM to air this and record it.,1263772800,3,146,4.178571428571429
327153,3,6301224701,"Sometimes someone puts together a piece of expensive garbage like ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" and you might think to yourself that that money could've been used for a better purpose elsewhere. But when I see a movie with production values as lousy as ""Native Son,"" I can understand why it's so bad. Low money, bad actors, a marginal script, worst director ever, and still having to secure shooting locations outside America because of the adapted novel writer's communist attachments. However, as bad as this movie is, I'd still watch this than suffer through a cinematic mistake about talking rat dogs.

A lot of the movie is wholly different from the book, probably for aesthetic reasons. For instance, when you only have enough dough for 90 minutes or so of storytelling, it's smart to zip through throwaway sections of book, like Bigger Thomas' arguments with his sister or scenes of him reading the newspaper all the time.

Several things are changed or missing from the book and none of it matters because it's still a whole, meaningful and sensible story despite its many shortcomings. The movie is just so badly acted though, it's sometimes laughable. Wright is not Bigger Thomas, he's a totally different guy from the screwed up hood in the novel. He's a nice person who is clearly trying to act tough and not doing it believably even for two seconds. And somebody should have taught him how to run like a man before this movie was made.

Gosh what a bad film. But it's better than anything I ever shot, so whatever.",1245196800,,1523,4.783269961977187
7811390,3,6301224701,"Let me clarify some history. This Native Son aka Sangre Negra was not made in Europe but in Argentina. At the time the movie was considered too inflammatory to do in the United States. I was an American girl living in Buenos Aires when someone came to the American high school looking for two American kids, boy and girl, whose voices could be dubbed in to the film. Small parts were played by Argentine actors who could speak English but not with an American accent---they wanted American voices to dub with. I was chosen for Bigger Thomas's sister Vera and the son of an American naval officer for Bigger's younger brother. We got off school for three days and got paid quite well although the work was boring as we mostly stood around and waited. Richard Wright himself played Bigger Thomas and some members of the American community played other parts---as I recall Bigger's attorney was in fact a local American attorney. All of which is why the acting seems amateur: it was. The director was Pierre Chanal---very kind, and his driver picked us up and took us home. My total movie career consisted entirely of shrieking ""Eeek, eek, a rat"" in this movie---acting was not my profession of choice.  I know the print is terrible, and so much of the novel is court trial anyway so that there's not a lot of action, but these unhappy reviews fail to recognize what race relations were ca 1950: terrible. The decision was made not to do this movie in the US with professional actors, and probably for good reason. Have mercy.",1512172800,,1523,4.640740740740741
