6302198,5,B00IXD2MU2,"The debut season of the first fantasy sitcom of the 60s - (not counting Mr. Ed the talking horse...) -
this show has the benefit of two fine comedic talents in the main roles - Bill Bixby as a young newspaper
reporter and Ray Walston as an astray Martian who crashes on earth and is taken in by Bixby under
the guise of being his uncle.
Of course there's lots of crazy plots and sitcom plots but Bixby and Walston make it fun.
The shows are complete and look fine and there are some nice bonus features.",1408406400,5,503,4.195876288659794
6302199,4,B00IXD2MU2,I had purchased Season 1 way back when it came out originally a few years ago and never got the rest of the seasons so I sold the set. Now I am thinking of re buying the new version. Good show. Like Bill Bixby however this box art makes him look so old and he was very young in this series as it was before the Courtship of Eddies Father and the Hulk.  What's with this bad picture of him??,1401667200,5,390,3.875
6302200,5,B00IXD2MU2,I lloved the show when it first came out.  My opinion has only gotten better.  It is a fun show to watch with lots of interesting science fiction elements.  It was one of the first scify television shows that was humorous with the thought of what would you do if you had met Uncle Martin.,1437350400,3,288,4.2

I went through the motions to return it which all went fine, but because I live in Australia it was not worth my will.  I am sure that it was just one of those things, but we were disappointed.",1426982400,,306,4.0

8645941,5,B00IXD2MU2,"Finally, the entire first episode...even the missing phone call Tim made to rewrite. The music from the cd is a great touch. Just wish there were more of this show's network promos  and the cereal commercials done in character included too.  The photo gallery and the British comic pages were nice, but could have included the Gold Key covers and collectables as well. Fans do appreciate that kind of detail.",1500422400,,408,4.814285714285714

8645944,5,B00IXD2MU2,"A lot of things happened in 1963.  Kennedy's assassination, the Beatles, Mercury space project ended, Soviets put the first woman in space and Studebaker ends production.  One thing that seldom makes the list is the beginning of My Favorite Martin.  Ray Walston plays ""Uncle Martin"", a Martian stranded on Earth after a narrow miss with a NASA spaceflight.  Crashlanding near Los Angeles, Martin is picked up by newpaper reporter Tim O'Hara (played by a VERY YOUNG Bill Bixby).

This series is long before Industrial Light and Magic make special effect everyday occurrences.  Here our special effects are limited to Uncle Martin's telescoping rabbit ear antenna from his head and his ability to disappear on command.  These were big news effects of the time and honestly, they looked good.

Season 1 has Tim and ""Uncle Martin"" in a variety of hijinks.  Many times these occurrences leave Tim with, as they used to say on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Love-Lucy/dp/B013FCLEIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Love Lucy</a>&nbsp;""'Splaining to do"".  This was fun stuff, seldom political, always satirical - as Uncle Martin was a true satirical man, well ""spaceman"".  Sure, it was white bread casting and writing, but that was the norm of the times.  Ah, 1963...",1473379200,,1302,5.553299492385787

8645947,4,B00IXD2MU2,"A dated, lightly comic, slower, non-violent series; the theme and script totally silly but fun. The script pokes fun at how everyday folks thought about the cosmos, other planets, easily deceived by a simple image portrayed by one person that started the idea of little green men and where that went, in the future years.
A martian crash lands near a single man's (Tim O'Hara, a journalist) apt and he finds him and brings him back to his place, telling everyone the man is his old ""Uncle Marti(a)n. And there begins the silly antics and situations and his seeming other-wordly powers (of which he gives one to Tim-mind reading, who can't handle it or keep it to himself): the 2 antennae that rise and fall on both sides of his head just before he disappears, his levitation of objects, his superior science knowledge of the cosmos, his ability to read human minds, among others. During an illness, I came across this and I laughed, its calm, various naive character portrayals evoke a seeming warm comfort of the time period. Not for everyone .",1453593600,,1045,4.715846994535519
