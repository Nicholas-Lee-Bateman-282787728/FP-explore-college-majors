440406,2,6302238331,"Man, what a bore.  I watched it because of all the accolades this movie has received over the years.  Maybe it was good years ago, but this movie has not aged well at all.  I mean, cmon, the whole premise is around  $500,000 worth of heroin.  Please.  Even in today's dollars, that's a joke.  The movie spends 10 minutes watching the cops rip the car apart trying to  find where the drugs are stashed.  Today, drug traffickers rent 26 foot  Ryder trucks to move the stuff around.  The vaunted chase scene was ok, but  again, it's nothing special compared to what's done today.
Essentially,  almost the entire movie consists of watching a couple unlikeable cops tail  bad guys for over an hour.  Yawn.",923616000,7,700,4.5772357723577235
440407,5,6302238331,"The French Connection remains one of the classics of film.  For brilliance of portrayal and suspense, it is timeless.

The film embodies what drives its two protagonists.  Alain Chanier (Fernando Rey) is a dapper businessman  on the outside, ruthless killer and drug kingpin on the inside.  NYPD  Detective Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman in a deserved  Oscar-winning performance) is a hyped-up cop who pursues his quarry with  glee, but is also quite likeable.  The contrasts are best shown in two  early scenes - Chanier's dapper nature comes through when he and his wife  Marie exchange gifts for their pending trip to the US; Popeye Doyle's  nature comes through in a thoroughly engaging scene when he and his partner  Cloudy Russo (Roy Scheider in what should have won him an Oscar) bust a  lowlife junkhouse bar; Popeye accosts men twice his size, pulls  ""dropsy"", and all knowing none of these scumbags will dare  protest.  The raid, though, is cover so Popeye can debrief one of his best  informants (Alan Weeks); the informant reveals the coming of ""a  shipment"" (Chanier's) in two weeks.  To make the ruse look good,  Popeye reluctantly busts the man's jaw (the grimace on Popeye's face as he  does so is priceless.).

Adding to the tension is the presence of FBI  Agent Bill Mulderig (stuntman Bill Hickman in a superb performance), who  hates Popeye, blaming him for the death of an officer in a previous case.  The two quarrel several times and come to blows at one point.

Through  it all, Popeye trails Chanier and his American friends, lawyer Joel  Weinstock, candy store owner Sal Boca (Tony Lo Bianco), actor Henri  Devereaux (Frederique De Pasquale), and others.  When Chanier barely  escapes Popeye's pursuit, he has his henchman Pierre Nicoli try to kill  him.  But the sniper attack is botched, and the result is a thrilling  chase; Nicoli hijacks an elevated train (killing a policeman and the train's conductor in the process), and Popeye commandeers a car to pursue.  When the motorman passes out the train crashes, allowing Popeye to corner and then kill Nicoli.  It is the unique nature of  the chase as well as its execution that makes it a film classic.  Most car  chases involve cars chasing cars; a car chasing a train is something that  hasn't been done, before or since.

Eventually Popeye and company seize  the car in which Chanier's junk is hidden.  They replace the stash, return  the car, and eventually tail Chanier to an abandoned crematorium where the  switch is made.  A gunfight ensues, and Popeye blasts a man in the shadows  - Mulderig.

In the epilogue we learn the fate of the captured hoods, none  of whom get any kind of serious sentence.  The unsatisfying outcome  embodies the unsatisfying outcomes of so many crimes - a further testimony  to this film's greatness.",922924800,3,2819,4.8747346072186835

440452,5,6302238331,"The plot itself is a little rushed, and there are certain events which seem highly implausible, but the plot isn't the star of the film here, it is the incomparable footage of New York City as it existed circa 1970. Gene Hackman is excellent and there are a number of thrilling action sequences, but for me, at least, it was a treat to be transported back in time to a New York City that was meaner, dirtier, and grittier, than the New York City of today.",1518048000,,455,4.3023255813953485

440457,2,6302238331,"My rating is (mostly) for the quality of the transfer. In a word: terrible. Apparently there was a push to preserve the original grain of the film, but I've found that this rarely transfers well to digital media. Most DVDs I own look better than this. With the additional assault on the senses of a poor audio transfer (not to mention the screeching score by Don Ellis), and this blu-ray becomes a headache-inducing, unwatchable experience. And if that isn't enough, several scenes employ that notorious ""shaky cam"" style, which I didn't even know existed in the seventies.

Beyond this, the movie has not dated well, and suffers from too much jumping around before you can really figure out what's happening. (I suspect I would have gotten into it earlier if I weren't so distracted by the poor quality of the video and audio.) If they ever come out with a cleaner transfer, I'll give this ""Best Picture Oscar Winner"" another try.",1504310400,,931,4.782608695652174

440479,5,6302238331,"French Connection is completely deserving of its classic status. It's one of the better crime dramas ever made, and it's like stepping back in time since watching the movie is like going on a tour of early 1970s New York City. On top of a fascinating story, the terrific location work brings the viewer back to another time and place like they were there.",1503100800,,355,4.5625

440482,5,6302238331,"Excellent movie of course, but the Filmmaker Signature Series release is the best copy to own, and it's not even close.  The first Blu-ray release had brutally awful color timing, and it's just baffling what Friedkin was thinking when he approved it.  The color timing of that release is nowhere close to how it looked in theaters (or on previous home video releases), and is terribly ugly on its own terms, with a bizarre emphasis on pastels.  Not surprisingly, the movie's cinematographer was quite unhappy with it.  Thankfully, the Filmmaker Signature Series release has none of those problems.  Friedkin worked with cinematographer Owen Roizman this time around, and the film looks as it should, with accurate colors and nice gritty 70's textures.  The release also contains the original mono audio mix, which in this case is far superior to the modern 5.1 mix (gunfire and sound effects are far too loud in the surround mix - the original mono mix has a perfect balance between dialogue, music, and sound effects).",1493251200,9,1019,4.964705882352941

440485,3,6302238331,This is a very very good movie.  It won a bunch of Oscar's including Best Picture and Best Actor for Gene Hackman.  Who had been in a lot of movies before this including Bonnie And Clyde but really wasn't that big of a name.  Like I said I think it is a very good movie.  But this isn't the type of movie that usually wins awards.  It's based on a true story that in the movie is very intense and gets you involved.  And the editing is great and desrved an Oscar.  But what is the difference between this and say something like Dirty Harry or Bullitt.  Gene Hackman reminded me a lot of Steve McQueen in this. And if you didn't know here is some trivia.  The Popeye's Chicken is named aft this because this was the founder's favorite movie.,1490486400,,740,4.191489361702128

Instead, it was much ado about a drug deal that wasn't all that interesting and people following (or watching) other people who didn't want to be followed (or watched).  The car chase scene with Hackman following the NYC train was exciting but completely unrealistic.  And I have to come back to the fact that there really wasn't much of a story.  If you live in Brooklyn and NYC it can be fun to see certain neighborhoods as portrayed in the movie.  But again, I think that the story was weak.  (The Bonus Features, including 2 documentaries, improved my opinion of the movie to 4 stars.  But the movie should still stand on its own.)",1458432000,,742,4.6106870229007635

That being said I thought all of the actors did a good job and I liked how things were not explained to death as they often are in movies today.

440943,5,6302238331,"Nowadays, describing a film as ""gritty realism"" has become a clich. Well, it wasn't a clich in 1971, when The French Connection was filmed. Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider give realistic portrayals of flawed individuals who are nevertheless the ""good guys,"" and Fernando Rey is their equal on the ""bad guy"" side: but in my opinion the cinematography is every bit as much the star of the film as the actors.

It was a great decision to show the dirty, decaying, dangerous mean streets of NYC rather than the Gotham scenes used by cop movies up till then. But the other half of the genius, which seems not to be much noticed, was the decision to shoot the film in winter. The brown, dead, leafless vegetation adds to the ""grit,"" but what impressed me was the light. The bare, stark light of winter, fading evenings and auburn afternoons, contribute an ambience that helps capture the look of a failing city. Contrast that with the scouring sunlight of Marseilles and you have a background that's as much a part of the story as the people in it.

There are so many ways The French Connection is a pioneer in cinema, it would take a wall of text to tell it. So let me just say that it's still as stunning as it was the day it was released. Sure, it was up-to-the-minute then, and now, some 40 years later it's a period piece. But what hasn't changed is its portrayal of a story and a place that will always feel real. For those who were too young to see it back then (or not even born yet), if you want to know what 1971 felt like, watch this movie twice. Once to enjoy the story, the second time to study the backdrop.

A solid five stars, and mentally add a sixth for aging so well.",1434326400,,1678,4.337579617834395

I saw it in the cinema when it came out and haven't seen it since, and yet the scene of the cops watching from outside while Fernando Rey and his henchman have a gourmet lunch has stuck with me through the years, as has the cat-and-mouse scene that ends with the Fed guy getting shot by Popeye (Gene Hackman).  Then there's the running Santa, the drive under the train trestles . . .one could go on.  It's a chase movie, yes, but the documentary feel of it gives the chase a credibility that all the ""Takens"" and ""Bournes"" in the world, with the fancy swirling cameras and the anonymous urban settings, just can't match.  Dirty Brooklyn is lovingly photographed, and the action was actually filmed in the streets around where the action of the real-life case took place.  Best of all is the ability of Hackman and Roy Scheider to take parts that were written quite sparingly and by action, gesture, expression, bring these two not-particularly-admirable men to vivid life.  It's tempting to think that all the ""gritty"" police dramas since, in movies or on television, owe their grit to William Friedkin's great movie.

441148,3,6302238331,"Holds up more as a nostalgia piece than anything else.  Hackman is great as Popeye Doyle, and intriguing to see NYC as it once was (and not the adult Disneyland it has become).  Unfortunately, the plot collapses as the movie progresses.  Events happen to fit the ending, and not in any logical or coherent way.  For example, the French Connection's seemingly competent and professional sidekick suddenly decides that the best way to kill Doyle is from a rooftop in a broad daylight.  He, of course, misses (and hits the innocent pedestrian instead) leading to the great car/ elevated-train chase scene.  And I hate to nitpick, but that particular scene begins with the second implausible foot chase where Hackman inexplicably runs down criminals either half his age (in the first case) or who have a four-story head start.  The movie plods along to an unsatisfying ending.  Popeye accidentally guns down his on-squad nemesis, but the moment has no cinematic value.  Still worth watching as one of the original urban reality/ gritty cop dramas that spawned a generation of similar movies and tv shows.  Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue, Homicide and The Wire can all thank Gene Hackman.",1428278400,4,1181,4.979591836734694

Hackman turns in his usual solid, interesting work but his characterization isn't anything out of the ordinary from what you'd see in a million other police shoot-em-ups before and since.

441432,5,6302238331,"A 1970's Grand Tour of NYC, drug deals gone bad, Gene Hackman & Roy Scheider too!
Settle back and watch an all-time classic, a movie that's considered one of the greatest American films ever made. It won 5 Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor (Hackman), Best Director (Friedkin), Best Film Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay (Tidyman). It was nominated for Best Supporting Actor (Scheider), Best Cinematography and Best Sound Mixing.
This movie takes you through several dozen NYC neighborhoods, on and off subway trains in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as well as to Washington, D.C. and France--as narcotics detectives Hackman and Scheider chase the bad guys in a fictionalized version of a true story about the NYC cops who tried to break up the largest heroin-smuggling syndicate in the world.",1424563200,,797,5.186046511627907

Also during the film you get black spots for 2-3 seconds about three times during the playing of the movie which is annoying.

You have to keep in mind that this movie was made over 43 years ago, and New York City was an absolute nightmare in 1971, with a large crime problem. This movie is politically incorrect, and it has a very gritty no holds barred approach to it. It's clear that the writer of this movie thought that drug laws were too soft as (SPOILER ALERT) the ending shows most of the dealers getting off with misdemeanors or suspended sentences. This movie was shot at the height of the ""War on Drugs"", and our views on drugs have evolved since 1971, as most people generally favor treatment over incarceration. This movie does portray French people, Italians, Jewish people, black people, white people and people from all walks of life as being involved in the drug business, and I think that it shows that Hackman's character was an outlier in the police force. In other words, I don't think that this movie is anti-cop or racist as some reviewers have stated, but rather a portrayal of circa 1970 New York City as it was with all it's crime, racism and corruption on display.",1420675200,,1127,4.584158415841584

441721,4,6302238331,"THE FRENCH CONNECTION is a superb crime drama with an excellent central performance by Gene Hackman. He plays Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle, a no-nonsense, obsessive narc who is on the trail of a suspected drug dealer with connections from France (hence, the title). What struck me immediately was the was gritty, verite-style cinematography and handheld camerawork. It perfectly fits the subject matter and helps add a sense of realism. Of course, one should mention Gene Hackman's brilliant lead performance. He plays Doyle as an cop who is obsessive about his job, and perhaps too much so. Even while having a drink with his partner after work, he manages to snoop around and people-watch, casing the place and looking for any suspicious activity. Granted his life isn't all work, but it's mostly work. There was also indication that his dedication has produced negative results in the past, so this also works as a portrait of a man on the edge. He's a man with drive, but not always pointed in the right direction. Still, he feels very strongly that the case he's working on is something big. Roy Scheider does a fine job as his partner, but no other character is given near the amount of attention or development as Doyle. Also worthy of mention is a spectacular chase sequence, which was apparently filmed guerilla style (really, most of the movie feels that way, to its credit). It was thrilling to watch, and is one of the best I'm seen committed to film. There were also many other great, tense moments, but that one stood out for being the ballsiest. And really, the pace of the movie never lets up. It's a fast ride from start to finish. Overall, I was very impressed with the look and feel of the film, as well as the fine character work by Gene Hackman. It does feel a little creaky in a few spots, but nothing that ruins the picture. I heartily recommend this to anyone who enjoys a great thrill-ride.",1406678400,,1907,4.678571428571429

Like the movie 'Bullet' (staring Steve McQueen), The French Connection stands firmly in the top 5 of action crime flicks. Gene Hackman really shows his amazing talents here and becomes the gritty bad ass Popeye Dole. Interesting that Roy Scheider only got 3rd billing--Scheider was superb as Bob Fossy in All That Jazz.

Those who say The French Connection's showing its age is like saying the Moon landing looks dated. Instead, we should be appreciating them as our Pioneers.

Most fans prefer the remastered 2012 Filmmaker Signature Series version of The French Connection after the pastel color debacle of the previous release. Despite the remastering, the picture quality is very average overall because the movie was shot primarily with handheld cameras and high-speed film stock to give it a gritty, raw, ""documentary-like"" feeling. The audio quality is fairly good but still shows its age at times. There is 148 minutes of total bonus content plus 2 audio commentaries, a trivia track, and an isolated score. Unfortunately, the excellent BBC documentary 'The Poughkeepsie Shuffle' is not included in this release so fans may want to hang onto the old DVD or Blu-ray versions. However, there are two featurettes exclusive to this release: Hackman on Doyle (11 min) and Scene of the Crime (5 min).

Great piece of filmmaking by the Legendary William Friedkin
plus Great performances by Gene Hackman and Roy schneider plus Great screenwriting aswell
and what do you get, one of the best action thrillers of the 70'S
this film definitely deserved an Academy award from the 1971 Oscars
it won  for Best Actor Gene Hackman, best Director william Friedkin & best picture
and is still enjoyable to watch some 40 years later
There's 2 blu-ray versions of this film the first 2008 release and this new Signature series release
the first blu-ray transfer was done by the Distributor 20th century fox with no involvement by Billy friedkin
well Billy hated this HD transfer
and in 2011 Billy & Cinematographer Owen roizman
 decided to step in personally & supervise a new HD transfer of this classic action thriller
and i tell you what Billy & owen's own HD transfer looks beautiful, incredible picture quality nice sharp & clear picture
Hardly no Grain or Dirt in the picture much better quality than the old 2008 blu-ray for sure
it's to bad Billy did not do the same for the sound quality, a new 6.1 or 7.1 Master mix would've improved
the sound quality big time instead the usual 5.1 Master audio mix has been left
which still sounds really Good, but a 6.1 mix would've boosted it big time
but the picture quality does look alot better than the old 2008 blu-ray

as for the extras, well all the special features have been carried over to this new signature series blu-ray
well most of them anyway
the 2 Audio commentaries are still on this 2011 blu-ray
plus these new featurettes DELETED SCENES with optional william friedkin commentary
ANATOMY OF A CHASE, HACKMAN ON DOYLE
FRIEDKIN & GROSSO REMEMBER THE REAL FRENCH CONNECTION
SCENE OF THE CRIME, COP JAZZ THE MUSIC OF DON ELLIS
ROGUE COP-THE NOIR CONNECTION
and MAKING THE CONNECTION a 56min making of TV special from 2000
all this on 1 blu-ray Disc
the only Doco that is not on this new signature series is the BBC Documentary Poughkeepsie shuffle
which is very similar Documentary as the Making the connection Doco
except it's done by the BBC, British broadcast co.
i guess 20th century fox had run out of Disc space
there's also a new 22page making of booklet included in the case
the packaging is just standard blu-ray case

so Definitetly time to upgrade buy this new signature series
a brand new HD transfer personally done by William friedkin & Owen roizman, not typically done by the Distributor

441845,4,6302238331,"This gritty, realistic police drama boasts two superlative features: Don Ellis's icy-cool music and possibly the greatest car chase ever filmed -- done entirely without optical effects. Based on a true story, Gene Hackman plays Harry ""Popeye"" Doyle, a New York City detective on the trail of a large heroin shipment from France. He and his partner, ""Cloudy"" Russo (Roy Scheider, distinctive in an early role), stake out the suspects, but when one of them tries to assassinate Popeye from an apartment rooftop, the chase is on, with the would-be killer attempting to escape aboard one of New York City's elevated trains, and Popeye down on the street in hot pursuit in a commandeered Pontiac GTO in the middle of city traffic. Friedkin mounted his cameras low and on the front of the chase car and transit train, and the effect is electrifying: Even watching on video, you may find yourself holding onto your seat. The veteran Spanish actor Fernando Rey plays the French drug kingpin with a wicked gleam in his eye, and the real Popeye -- named Eddie Egan -- appears in a cameo as a detective supervisor.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",1377561600,,1354,5.707920792079208

Plus the disc is full of fascinating extras and commentaries, giving the lowdown on how this classic was made and the typical Hollywood trials and tribulations during the making of.

(Also won statuettes for Best Director, Picture, Screenplay and Editing.)

Based on a real NYPD narco case and detective Eddie Egan, as portrayed by Hackman, Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle is a loose cannon in a porkpie hat. His nearly rabid pursuit of drug-smuggling ""Frog #1"" (Rey) comes to naught at this one's close, setting up a not-as-good sequel. (TRIVIA: In Egan's cameo as Walt Simonson, he gives Popeye a ""dig"" by repeating Doyle's favorite interrogation gimmick, the feet picking question.)

Use of soundtrack music here is unique. In the film's most action-packed scenes, there's NONE. Somehow this lack of blaring music works great.

Of historical note: the Bensonhurst Elevated Railway train that Doyle pursues in a commandeered auto is a last survivor of an extensive system built in the 1870s by Robber Baron Jay Gould. (MORE TRIVIA: During this electrifying chase sequence, a real collision occurs with another car, driven by a man going to work.)

With no real results, they get pulled off the special assignment. That all changes after an unexpected twist followed by a wild chase.

441877,2,6302238331,"I find myself flabbergasted that this film won the Academy Award for best picture.  We watched it last night for the first time, and had to force ourselves to finish it.  This film consists of little more than stakeouts, bickering, and eating, and it has so many flaws that it's almost laughable at times.  For example, when Frog One is eating lunch, Hackman is standing on the sidewalk in plain view watching him for the entire lunch, which was very long.  No cop in the world is going to remain that visible unless he wants to be seen.  And let's not forget that the famous chase scene begins when Hackman sees the sniper on the ground--already running away--from the roof; when Hackman runs down four flights of stairs and gets on the street, he's less than 100 yards from the guy.

Characters are developed only in the most superficial of ways.  Hackman utters a few racial slurs, so we know he's a racist.  Schieder's character just hangs around with him, but we learn nothing of him as a person.  We know nothing of any of the criminals other than the fact that they're criminals.

All in all, there are a few strengths here, but they're not enough to pull this film from the depths of mediocrity.

American dramatic thriller. Stars Gene Hackman, Fernando Rey and Roy Scheider. Adapted and fictionalized by Ernest Tidyman from  non-fiction book by Robin Moore. Tells the story of New York Police Department detectives ""Popeye"" Doyle and Buddy ""Cloudy"" Russo, whose real-life counterparts were Narcotics Detectives Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso. Egan and Grosso also appear in the film, but as characters other than themselves.

The film revolves around the smuggling of narcotics between Marseilles and New York City. In Marseilles a policeman is staking out Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey), a heroin smuggler. The policeman is killed by Pierre Nicoli, Charnier's henchman (Marcel Bozzuffi). In New York, detectives James ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Buddy ""Cloudy"" Russo (Roy Scheider) are conducting an undercover stakeout in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.

Charnier soon ""makes"" Doyle and realizes he has been observed since his arrival in New York. Nicoli offers to kill Doyle; Charnier objects - killing one policeman will not amount to anything, he argues, but Nicoli says they will be in France well before they can be detained. Nicoli botches the killing of Doyle and ends up hijacking an elevated train.

In one of the greatest car chase sequences in movie history, Popeye grabs a civilian's car (a 1971 Pontiac LeMans) and frantically chases that elevated train. The scene was filmed in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn roughly running under the BMT West End Line (currently the D train, then the B train) which runs on an elevated track in Brooklyn, with the chase ending just north of the 62nd Street station after the train crashed into another train up ahead. Popeye finally catches up with and manages to shoot Nicole.

It was the first R-rated movie to win the Academy Award for Best Picture since the introduction of the MPAA film rating system. It also won Academy Awards for Best Actor (Gene Hackman), Best Director, Best Film Editing, and Best Adapted Screenplay (Ernest Tidyman). Best Cinematography and Best Sound. Tidyman also received a Golden Globe Award, a Writers Guild of America Award and an Edgar Award for his screenplay.

Title cards before the closing credits note that Joel Weinstock and Angie Boca got away without prison time while Lou Boca got a reduced sentence and Devereaux served four years. Charnier was never caught. Both Doyle and Russo were transferred out of the narcotics division. Just as if anybody really cared.

Despite all the praise and prizes heaped on it, nothing is as right as the film's accounts: from a budget of $m2 to box office revenue of $m52! Not too bad for mostly kiddy stuff - acting, driving and otherwise. R-rating would hardly still be needed today; all looks quite tame.

(Also won statuettes for Best Director, Picture, Screenplay and Editing.)

Based on a real NYPD narco case and detective Eddie Egan, as portrayed by Hackman, Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle is a loose cannon in a porkpie hat. His nearly rabid pursuit of drug-smuggling ""Frog #1"" (Rey) comes to naught at this one's close, setting up a not-as-good sequel. (TRIVIA: In Egan's cameo as Walt Simonson, he gives Popeye a ""dig"" by repeating Doyle's favorite interrogation gimmick, the feet picking question.)

Use of soundtrack music here is unique. In the film's most action-packed scenes, there's NONE. Somehow this lack of blaring music works great.

Of historical note: the Bensonhurst Elevated Railway train that Doyle pursues in a commandeered auto is a last survivor of an extensive system built in the 1870s by Robber Baron Jay Gould. (MORE TRIVIA: During this electrifying chase sequence, a real collision occurs with another car, driven by a man going to work.)

441899,5,6302238331,"The French Connection is an amazing, true-life story which earned a #70 spot on the AFI Top 100 of movies for many reasons. One is that it features a car chase thought to be one of the best in cinema history. A car chases a subway trail through the streets of New York City, nearly getting destroyed along the way. The storyline is that of two NYC detectives who happen on a drug transaction involving a Frenchman. The detectives get grief from within the force, but with perseverence they are able to track down the perpetrators.

Watching this in modern times is fascinating. First, there's a lot of throwing around of slurs about just about every ethnic group you can imagine. There is police brutality, slurs against women, against blacks, against Italians, against French, and it's all considered as normal. There's pretty much only one woman in the entire movie and I think she has two lines total. A cop shoots a suspect in the back and it's presented as typical. I do want to note that research shows that the police advisors to the movie complained about that scene and were overruled. But we definitely commented on that when watching it. And we do have NYC police in our family.

It's interesting to watch how much life has changed in other ways. A guy goes to a ticket counter at an airline and buys a ticket with cash, and writes his own name on the ticket to take to the gate. In a subway, someone knocks on the driver's door and he simply opens it to see what they want. Nobody else seems to be able to stop the train - there were no emergency stop lines. And of course in modern times people would be tweeting and calling from the train, not completely cut off.

I loved the scene where a drug dealer is being trailed and he's able to shake off the cop simply by getting on and off a subway. In modern times they'd be quite able to handle that situation. Here, it throws him completely off his game.

I was vastly amused when Roy Scheider, also famous from Jaws, was tracking down one of his enemies, and they started to play Jaws-like music. Of course this movie here came first, so it's almost as if they saw how powerful it was here and then ramped it up even more a few years later for Jaws.

Is the way citizens are treated a bit concerning? Certainly. Is the time-capsule look into the way things were run back in 1971 absolutely fascinating? Yes, yes, yes. Highly recommended as a glimpse into a world of not too long ago, to see how far we have come, and also how in some ways things have stayed quite the same.

Russo is much more straight laced and calm compared to Doyle, and the tow character balance each other.  The camera work in the chase scenes is simple and brutal, and director William Friedkin really makes a film that is basically about two guys following two other guys very suspenseful and real.

441904,5,6302238331,"The French Connection is the ultimate movie crime drama, and is now a yard stick by which all others are judged.  Director, William Friedkin strived for realism in this film by shooting it like a documentary. You can almost smell the seedy streets,  and get an idea what the John Lindsay-era of New York was really like. There is absolutely nothing stagy about this film. Unlike the unrealistic dramatic exploits in films like Lethal Weapon, everything in the French Connection is believable. It helps that this film is based on real drug bust from the early sixties.  Gene Hackman, who plays Popeye Doyle, is a tough, unrefined, but effective cop in pursuit of an international drug dealer played by Fernando Ray (called frog 1). In the entire film the French drug kingpin is elusive. The two leads play a cat and mouse game through various location in New York, including the subway.

No effective cop film with be without a decent car chase scene, and the French Connection has the best ever filmed. Arguments can be made that Peter Yate's Bullets is the best, but it lacks the believability of Friedkin's car chase.  For example, the French Connection car case is filmed under a train bridge populated with cars and pedestrians.  In the Bullet car chase scene, the streets seem to a little absent of traffic and it looks more staged.  In the French Connection car chase, Popeye Doyle is constantly dodging cars and people as he pursues the train above. The director here masterfully edits between the car and the hijacked train.  The use of sound is also effectively used here, and the car engine roar adds to the dramatic tension.

The last scene of the film is shot in an abandoned warehouse where Popeye finally corners his nemesis(frog 1). We hear an eerie sound track as the desperate cop walks through the dank corridors. Unfortunately, Popeye ends up shooting another cop, and the bad guy disappears into darkness.

There is no poetic justice in this film.",1319068800,,1967,4.792899408284024

441917,3,6302238331,"For years, I loved the weird music and the pacing of this movie. The scene where they're stewing over why the car weighs too much and how to find the hidden stuff. The fantastic setup of the ending. And the City of New York---so gritty and ugly-beautiful. This movie showed me the New York visual that I remembered from when I was a kid. New York itself as another actor in the movie...essential stuff. Image upon image piling up. Winning me over. Taking me along.

Trouble is, I hadn't bothered to see this movie from the true beginning of the film for quite a few years...I seemed to always be picking up on this movie on TV when it was about 30-45 minutes in. So I always saw it at its best. When I finally watched it right from the beginning four or five years ago, after I bought the movie for myself, I was appalled at how tissue-paper much of this movie's emotional heart was: Popeye Doyle is an obsessed character without depth or even much intelligence. He has very little personality---just a mouth, really. Roy Scheider is decorative and a supporter of Doyle, a bit of a Greek chorus to Doyle's schemings, but not much else. The racism and general bullying nature of the Popeye character is painful and even embarrassing to me now...why did I ever like this movie? The humanity is entirely missing. It's just cars, buildings, music. When Doyle pleads his case (""let me do this, I know I can do it"", his superiors don't care. I find that I don't care either. He isn't convincing. He's just a mouth under a hat. Why DO they let him? We never really see why. He just DOES it. No one discusses anything. It all just happens. (I know this is Friedkin's style, but it's not working for me in this movie anymore. I've grown up.)

Hmmm. The movie's good points now? It's a tarnished idol. A time-slice, the first of its gritty cop-movie, fast-paced, tell-it-like-it-is, don't stop for breath, chase-scene kind, admittedly. But to weigh its merits now presents a true dilemma. As long as I don't watch it from the beginning, it's pretty good. Maybe even more than that, at times. It has much of the old gritty magic...but it isn't worth the ""it's a masterpiece"" rhetoric anymore. It has spooky-good bits but a lot of that has to do with the marriage of the visual pace with the occasional musical score; it supplies a disjointed but jarring emotional link that the characters themselves cannot give you, they are too disaffected.

This movie's early scene featuring NYC gritty cop reality laced with racial bullying just makes me feel bad and embarrassed as a white person, frankly. And as horrible as drugs and heroin and the overall heroin trade seem to me (and always has), I just don't think society cares about getting rid of it to the extent that it once did. So that single-mindedness seems kinda crazy now, kinda Hollywood-exaggerated. There's just too many other crises to deal with that are Level 10 nowadays. And the later bit about Doyle commandeering the citizen's car just seems...delusional and a total classic authority-gone-mad-power-trip from the past, representative of when cops and officials were allowed to do whatever they pleased, seemingly...yeah, a cop can just run into the middle of the street and stop somebody, pull them bodily out of their car, jump into their car, drive it away, smash it up, and it's OK...police business...he's just being a cop. It makes this movie's car-chase seem like a slice of bad 70s TV...and it's probably this exact movie that inspired much of the bad 70s cop crap we had to watch back then.

Now, I don't have any sentiment against cops. The opposite of that, if anything. I respect them and thank God they're there. Always have. But Popeye Doyle is an embarrassment from an embarrassing, notoriously corrupt era, and I don't think you should bother with this movie unless you realize it is very dated now. Man, that bit where Doyle goes in the bar and insults and slaps around all the black drug dealers in there (because every single person in the crowded bar is both black and automatically assumed to be a drug dealer, of course!) just makes me cringe. And I never thought I was a knee-jerk type of PC person. I figured I could get the subtext and overcome the other stuff...but it's too stark to me now, I can't overcome it. It's garbage, that scene practically a ficto-documentary of police abuse and disrespect to black men, and has no merits other than its telling of a bad, sad, nasty time in this nation's history. The scene ACTUALLY MADE ME FEEL BAD FOR THE DRUG DEALERS, if that's possible! And I don't want to be feeling bad for drug dealers. I want to hate them...this movie makes me hate Doyle instead. I find that grotesque somehow, a real failure---but at this point in my life, I can tell it is not my personal failure; the failure is in this movie. And I've had years to find this out, I've outgrown easy emotions. The Doyle character, at least as portrayed in this movie, is just not worth watching. (I like, even love Gene Hackman in so many other movies: The Conversation, Hoosiers, Downhill Racer, Get Shorty...even as Lex Luthor...he's nearly always worth watching, at times even fascinating to watch.)

Yeah, I guess you could say I'm a little disillusioned about this movie. I can still enjoy To Live And Die in LA, though...",1311984000,2,5313,4.647872340425532

441922,4,6302238331,"This excellent film was released in the autumn of 1971; Pauline Kael writes about theater audiences being ""almost sick with excitement"" - this was something new in the genre of the police drama, much grittier and rawer, more real, more explosive. (That said, ""In Cold Blood"" broke a fair bit of new ground in terms of grittiness, five years earlier.)

I love the 1970s for movies, specifically the first half of the decade, roughly from ""Easy Rider"" through ""Jaws"" - it's my favorite period for American films (it's the favorite of plenty of people, of course), when genres were getting redefined (the Mafia picture with ""The Godfather,"" the Western with ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller,"" the war picture with ""MASH,"" etc.). This movie is an essential part of the period. (Yeah, I realize ""Easy Rider"" is '69.) My understanding is, Hollywood took a little while to catch up to the social/cultural revolution of the '60s. I want to read that book about the period, ""Easy Riders/Raging Bulls.""

A few more random thoughts:

- I was taking an urban studies class in high school in St. Paul at the time; we attended this film on a cold day in January, 1972, as a lesson in the decay of the American city. My teacher said that New York City was ""not governable, and here's your proof."" Not governable! I believed that for years! I didn't move to NYC after college in 1977 because of what the guy said! This ""not governable"" nonsense was a widespread feeling at the time; it intensified during the fiscal crisis circa 1975. I guess this is a lesson to me, not what the teacher said, but that teachers are often wrong, that the year 2010 does not have a unique purchase on American pessimism, and that a huge democracy always has big problems.

- Francis Coppola watched this movie and felt despair in his heart; he convinced himself that the dark, slow movie he was about to release, ""The Godfather,"" would not grab audiences nearly as well as this flashy, fast creation. This reminds me of Paul McCartney just before the release of ""Revolver"" suddenly deciding the whole project wasn't good enough, it was out of tune, etc. Sometimes artists can get too close to their work.

- I've seen William Friedkin in several significant interviews. He comes across, to me, as very smart and very shrewd, just the sort of person I'd hire to helm a big project, and, for some reason, the last person on God's green Earth that I want to have a beer with. I haven't quite figured this out yet.

Spoiler alert! My next two items concern a key sequence in the movie.

- Regarding the car-in-the-garage sequence (cinematic genius, of course): Irv's tool for ripping apart the car makes a noise that's a nice little take-off on some of the soundtrack music. As Cloudy Russo might say, ""Cute.""

- At the climax of the car-in-the-garage sequence, Irv says, ""I ripped everything out of there except the rocker panels."" Popeye bellows, ""C'mon, Irv, what are the rocker panels?"" To which the best reply is, ""Well, Popeye, the rocker panels are strips of metal that cover cavernous spaces in the car that are perfect for storing 120 pounds of heroin. That I forgot about until just now.""",1291939200,,3151,4.685352622061483
441923,5,6302238331,"In ""The French Connection,"" French drug-dealer Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) plans to smuggle 120 pounds of heroin into New York City and return to France with the money that he would receive from the sale of the dope, but NYC detective Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman) exhibits reckless determination in attempting to put the kibosh on the transaction and bring the smugglers to justice.

Hackman won his first Academy Award in this spectacular film which netted five Oscars overall, including Best Picture for 1971.  The tension builds slowly throughout the movie as Doyle and fellow detective Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider) stalk the villains.  Judicious use of dramatic music heightens the suspense, and the portrayal of New York City is so gritty that the Big Apple of the early Seventies ends up being another star in the film.  The chase scene is legendary (one of the pleasures of the film is seeing all of the period cars), and the movie culminates in a shocking ending.

441929,5,6302238331,One of the classic cop movies of all time. Keeps moving with plenty of action. Never forgot the name Popeye Doyle.,1260921600,,114,4.476190476190476
441930,5,6302238331,"The absolute brillance of French Connection is not the story, a pretty straightforward one about an obseesed cop and a drug dealer. The absolutle brillance is in the story telling.

From the word go, we do not follow the story as much as feel it. Detectives Doyle and Grasso start their tail of a drug dealer on a hunch late at night and this extends-unexpectedly-to morning. Both detectives are cold and tired, told by the slow walks and rubbing of worn eyes. ""Its eight in the morning."" Grasso jabs at Doyle, and you hear the break in his voice.

The pursit continues as ""the frog"" comes from France. In probably one of the most viceral scenes ever filmed, the drug smuggler takes his connection to lunch in a gourmet resturant and the detectvies wait outside. They eat cold pizza and drink watery coffee. Doyle has to move his feat to avoid numbness. He blows into his gloves and rubs his hands together. Suddenly, we as viewers start to feel cold.

All this materfully conveyed viceral detial is not a flash of technique. Undercover is exausting, frustratining work, and this is told by Friendkins use of micropoints. He shows us how cops burn out.

Friendkin may be our best director not because of what he shows us but how he makes us feel what he shows. He is the only filmaker I know  that can make me feel tactile sensations the way most great autaurs make me feel emotions. Scorcesee may be more consistent and yes, I have never seen Martin shoot a frame that did not have perfect composition and more texture in one shot than most commercial features pack in one film. He is by far our America's most consistent film genius. But if I want to feel cold during a summer heatwave, I go to Freidkin.

French Connection takes paitiance, especially by today's quickie cut MTV editing standards. But with Friendkin, the message is in the medium, and if younger viewers can adapt to the slower pace of this 1971 film and wait with Doyle and Grasso, their effort will be 100 fold rewarded",1258070400,,1990,4.575842696629214
441931,4,6302238331,"Gene Hackman shines in this 104 minute groundbreaking, exciting film released in 1971.  Forever known as Popeye Doyle, his signature role, Mr. Hackman is retired as an actor (his last role was in Welcome to Mooseport in 2004 opposite Ray Romano), but has been an accomplished author for a number of years.  The action scenes in this film are amazing, especially that famous car chase under that train trestle in New York.

Popeye Doyle is a Narcotic Cop after drug dealers headed up by an elusive Frenchman and his brutal sidekick.  Hackman is helped along in his chase by Roy Scheider, who plays his detective partner.  Great chemistry between the two, a lot of sardonic wit from Hackman.  While Scheider's character is underplayed, he does a great job, going on to superstardom in Jaws a few years later.

This is Hackman's vehicle, however, and his Popeye Doyle is as relentless as The Terminator in his pursuit of the villains.  Hackman, whose acting teachers epic failed by telling him that he would never amount to anything, are probably turning in their graves now, as he has indeed retired as one of the best film actors in the history of the profession.  For this reason, I probably would watch him reading the phone book and still be impressed.

The movie's climax is somewhat unsatisfying, and even the score seems to reflect this.  Perhaps it's the director's way of saying, ""this is what's going on and maybe we need to be doing something about it in real life!""

The sound mix, given thunder by the Dolby 5.1 treatment on this 2-disc DVD set, is outstanding, especially in how things move about in the stereo field.  I definitely plan on getting French Connection II.

441934,5,6302238331,"Back in the days before the Oscars were hijacked by politically correct pressure groups who were only interested in rewarding boring films that promoted their tedious agendas and concerns, there were a few years in the seventies when they actually rewarded films that were well-written, well-shot and well-acted pieces of drama which, more importantly, said something valuable about the human condition regardless of how unseemly, politically incorrect or unfashionable such statements or observations might have been.

William Friedkin's ""The French Connection"" was such a film.

Friedkin freely adapted the exploits of Eddie ""Popeye"" Egan and Sonny Grosso - two New York cops who, through a mixture of tenacity, intellect and plain old-fashioned hard work, managed to bust a highly lucrative narcotics pipeline that was flooding the boroughs of New York with Heroin - into a superlative example of the police thriller and a masterclass in film-making. The film itself is essentially a police procedural in which NYC Narcotics detectives Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider) initially become aware of a new player on the drugs scene after noticing something amiss whilst drinking in a bar, and then track their way back along the chain of dealers, traffickers and money-men to the source, Gallic Narcotics trafficker and former Marseilles Longshoreman, Alain ""Frog One"" Charnier (Fernando Rey) - who is gearing up to import a vast shipment of smack into the US.

What sets Friedkin's film apart from the numerous scores of predecessors and imitators was it's absolute commitment to reality: Hackman's Doyle is a hard-bitten, unflinching, bully of an obsessive who is only too happy to beat a suspect up in an alleyway if it will get him one step closer to the object of his quest and it is his increasing obsession with collaring the elusive ""Frog One"" that eventually becomes the focus of the film; the final devastating moments illustrating to both his shocked partner and the audience just how far along the path of darkness he is prepared to go in order to make his collar. Neither Friedkin nor Hackman shy away from depicting what ""Popeye"" Doyle 'is' and I cannot imagine that a major studio in this day and age would release a film featuring the plentiful depictions of Afro-Americans being systematically harassed by the Police that appear in this film. Similarly, Friedkin's commitment to almost Verite-style location shooting manages to capture New York in all of it's recession-blighted early seventies dilapidation. It looks like the last place on the Earth that you'd want to make your home and is the stark antithesis of the kind of whimsically nostalgic portrayal of the city recently screen in the terrible, execrable US remake of ""Life On Mars"".

In terms of acting, Hackman and Scheider have never been better than they are in this film and make possibly the most realistic cop duo to ever grace the screen. The respect, tolerance, weariness and latent antagonism of two men who have spent a considerable amount of time watching each other's backs is there for all to see. In opposition to many of today's so-called screen actors, they 'show', they don't 'tell'.

""The French Connection"" is a brilliant film that quite rightly garnered 'best director' and 'best actor' Oscars for Friedkin and Hackman respectively in 1972.

If you have any interest in cinema, consider it a must-see and pick up this lavish two-disc edition package.",1255305600,,3480,5.128747795414462
441952,5,6302238331,"As long as you're not easily offended, there's a lot to enjoy in this gritty film. No doubt aided by Friedkin's background in documentary filmmaking, the handheld cameras are reminiscent of later works by Paul Greengrass (director of the second two Bourne movies).

Seven bucks for the Two-Disc Collector's Edition? Ridiculously good deal. Includes a full-length commentary by the director, plus commentary snippets from Hackman and Scheider. Also a couple documentaries, deleted scenes, and more.

I don't like DVD cover but that's just nitpicking. The one from the Blu-Ray release is better, but from what I've heard, the content itself on that release isn't.

Heck, just the chance to see New York City in the early Seventies make this riveting, never mind the headlong chase after a drug smuggling operation by the incomparable Gene Hackman.

441957,2,6302238331,"The French Connection was and remains an immensely entertaining cops and drug smugglers film.  The movie is probably best remembered for Gene Hackman's manic car chase, during which Hackman appears to be oblivious to both his own safety and that of the citizens of the densely populated city he is sworn to protect. However spectacular that scene may have been, it was far down the list of the film's best moments. These come, ironically, in the slower scenes, such as the unauthorized stakeout during which Popeye and his partner doggedly pursue evidence against a suspected small time drug dealer.  All in all, the film is an excellent portrayal of the gritty, dirty world of drug law enforcement.

That's the good news.  The bad news is that the print quality of the blu-ray disk is virtually indistinguishable in most scenes from a standard definition DVD.  Worse, in some places (Particularly the night and low light scenes)the added definition of blu-ray actually seems to emphasize the graininess and soft focus of the film.  In short it's a great movie but an inferior blu-ray product.",1238716800,6,1093,4.978021978021978
441958,2,6302238331,"I'm afraid I have to agree with other reviewers of this Blu Ray version of William Friedkin's masterpiece. It looks awful a large part of the time, which completely ruins the other times when it shines.

Ironically, the problem lies in the film's strength - its gritty portrayal of New York and the drug culture taking a grip of it in the early Seventies. The Director wanted realism - not just in his actor's performances, but literally how their New York playground looked - so he went for that. Movements are blurry, alleyways are hazy, characters are observed from an out-of-focus distance (aping what Popeye Doyle sees) - everything's grimy and washed out - matching the film's down and dirty feel.

Unfortunately when you get outside of the sunny Marseilles sequences and into the seedy bars and restaurants of the Big Apple - the Blu Ray picture resembles worn out videotape - it's really awful. Which is such a shame, because as you watch it again - but this time on the big screen - you realize what a blindingly fabulous film ""The French Connection"" is - and how it deserved so much better than this.

In fairness to Fox, the opening credits are squeaky clean - no lines, no scuffs, nothing - no print remains that clean after 38 years, so some restoration has to have been done. Unfortunately when you get to the street action - instead of enhancing the watch - the Blu Ray only makes the deliberately grainy effect look even worse.

Half way through it - I couldn't stand to look at it anymore - I turned it off...

Unless you absolutely must own this, rent it first before wasting your hard-earned on yet another dog on this increasingly frustrating format...

What a disappointment.",1238025600,9,1696,4.655518394648829
441959,4,6302238331,"I do like this movie, in fact I think it is very well done and very entertaining, but in the end I must admit that this is far from a brilliant movie.  It is an effective police thriller that never really transcends the boundaries of the genre and this becomes rather generic when you think about it.  The performances are good, but not great, and as much as I love Gene Hackman I must admit that this is a far cry from his best performance (look to his 1988 work in `Mississippi Burning' for a more fleshed out and human portrait of a conflicted lawman).

The movie concerns two detectives, Jimmy Doyle and Buddy Russo, who are struggling to tie up the lose ends in a drug ring; the French connection spoken of in the title referring to the Marseilles port through which the drugs are making their way stateside.  Doyle and Russo are two very different cops with two very different ways of handling their jobs, and as the pressure mounts we can see Doyle boil over until his actions are speaking much louder than his words.

It is tense in scenes, and then car chase scenes are ridiculously brilliant, but in the end I can't get around the fact that this is not the movie it is touted as.

I will say this; William Friedkin does a brilliant job of creating an engrossing and fast paced thriller that will always keep you glued to the screen.  Even when the film feels unoriginal and rather redundant it is still captivating thanks to Friedkin's stellar camera work.  He's a dynamic director, and while this is not his best work (I found him utterly flawless in `The Exorcist' and all sorts of fantastic in `Bug') he has an unforgettable style that will keep your attention.  The script is nothing fantastic or truly memorable, but it works for what it is trying to be.

I understand that this served as a foundation for better police thrillers to come, so don't think I'm knocking it's `classic' status, I'm just pointing out the fact that it has not aged as gracefully as it could have.  Especially when you consider this according to today's standards you see that this is a very `by the books' thriller that takes little leeway to become something revolutionary.

The performances are stable, but nothing more.  Both Hackman and Roy Scheider received Oscar nominations; Hackman going on to win the gold, but in all honesty I wouldn't have nominated either of them.  Scheider delivers a very hollow performance, beings that the film isn't really interested in him as a character.  He is merely there to represent a polar opposite to Hackman.  At least Hackman does `something' with his performance, but even he doesn't really do much.  He is merely a gimmick; a thin fabrication of what the `crooked cop' character is supposed to look like; but he really has no meat on those bones.  There is a back story there, but it rarely makes it to the surface.

Again, I like this movie, and I watch it frequently because it is so engaging; but I have to be honest and point out the fact that it is rather hollow and no where near what it could have been.  I give it a B, and I do recommend it, but I recommend it with reservations.  I will not pimp this as cinematic brilliance; because quite frankly, it's not.",1238025600,2,3206,4.521663778162911
441960,2,6302238331,"Based on the true story of how two New York police detectives, ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider), uncovered a drug smuggling operation between France and America.

Given its five Oscar wins (including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Director), it appears that, back in 1971, ""The French Connection"" was considered very highly and even today it still enjoys a very high reputation, but after sitting through this movie, I can't, for the life of me, figure out why. With the exception of the ending (which is a bit of an anti-climax), ""The French Connection"" isn't a terrible movie, but it's not all that great either. The film is slow moving and didn't engage me at all. There is little tension present and the script didn't provide me with any means of relating to or caring about ""Popeye"" Doyle. The car chase, which everyone talks about, is disappointing by modern standards, and although I would agree that Gene Hackman is an Oscar-worthy actor, I don't think he did anything Oscar-worthy in this film.

What makes the reputation of ""The French Connection"" even harder to understand is that it was released the same year as ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""The Last Picture Show"", beating both of these films to win its many accolades. I recently saw ""A Clockwork Orange"" for the first time and I was blown away by just how incredible that film is, even more than 40 years after it was made. If ""A Clockwork Orange"" were released today, I am certain that it would be just as highly regarded as it was in 1971, whereas I doubt that the same thing can be said about ""The French Connection"".

441985,5,6302238331,"REVISED FOR NEW 2012 BEST BUY ""SIGNATURE COLLECTION"" SINGLE DISC RELEASE OF ""THE FRENCH CONNECTION""

The 2011 remaster ""Signature Collection"" DVD features a brand new transfer that hews closer to the original look of the film and was supervised by Cinematopgraher Owen Reizman with William Friedkin. The colors no longer bleed like they did with the oversatured (and, alternatively, sometimes monochromatic)transfer that Friedkin supervised for release in 2008.

The way to tell the difference between the 2008 and 2012 reissue is 1) the cover for the reissue features a close shot of Gene Hackman (and it states ""Director's Signature Series"" below Hackman's face)and it is a single disc release ommiting the 2nd disc (all of the extras are on the first disc with the exception of the BBC Documentary ""The Poughskeepie Shuffle"" and (naturally) the featurette on the new coloring timing.

Colors are quite nice here--far more natural and not as oversaturated as the Friedkin release and reflect what a pristine new restored print would look like. The transfer is clean of dirt, debris, etc. and although the image quality is soft at times, part of that has to do with the shooting choices, age of the film, etc. Skin textures, tones and detail look remarkably sharp considering the age of the film.

Audio features the same 5.1 HD DTS transfer as the previous Blu-ray, an English Surround, original mono, Spanish and French 5.1 mixes.

I'm not sure at this stage if Fox is offering an exchange for fans who purchsed the 2008 Friedkin version with color timing changes for the single disc 2012. I've put an email question on this but have not heard back as of yet but will update this review if it turns out that they WILL offer it.

We also get a booklet that discusses the making of the movie and the actors.

I'd recommend the remaster although I would have liked to see Fox include the BBC documentary as well.

ORIGINAL 2008 REVIEW BELOW:

Folks that have the DVD version of ""The French Connection"" may want to hold on to it since director Friedkin went back and altered the look of his film--some folks will like it some will not.

The film certainly deserves five stars the transfer here three with the altered color timing three as Friedkin messes with the look of a classic movie that didn't need it.

William Friedkin's Academy Award winning ""The French Connection"" altered the rules for the police drama. He eschewed the procedural approach of many films instead going for a gritty, raw documentary look for the film. First up--this is a film that is over 30 years old so its not going to look like a more contemporary film with a slick veneer to the transfer. Friedkin went back and personally supervised the transfer going for a more washed out look to the colors as well coming as close to a noir film as possible for a color film. That's good news and bad for fans; it's never quite looked like this before but, according to the introduction by Friedkin, this is really how he had intended for it to look from the beginning. So if you have your original DVD and love the look of the film there you probably won't like the look of the film here on Blu-ray. Ideally, Friedkin and Fox should have released the film resembling its original theatrical version and his new one together so fans could watch which ever one they preferred. This 2008 remaster looks almost colorized at times with colors deliberately oversatured or bleeding.

I should note that those people raised on Michael Bay action films will probably find some of the film slow going. Friedkin's film is from a time when directors didn't feel the need to cut films for an audience with media induced ADD. Friedkin recognized that the drama in addition to the editing would pull people in and that rapid editing where appropriate was perfect but if it was inappropriate it would detract from the performances.

Fox ports over all of the extras from the deluxe two disc edition(including ""The Pougkeepsie Shuffle"", commentary tracks, the isolated score, deleted scenes)and adds some exceptional extras. We also get ""Hackman on Doyle"", ""Rogue Cop: The Noir Connection"", ""Color Timing 'The French Connection'"", ""Scene of the Crime"" (where Friedkin returns to the locations he shot the film), ""Friedkin and Grosso Remember 'The French Connection'"" and ""Cop Jazz: The Music of Don Ellis"". The bulk of the extras are on the second disc of the set.

Based on a true story about Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman)and Buddy Rosso (Roy Scheider) as they pursue a major heroin smuggling ring in New York City. Doyle is brash, flagrently breaks the rules in pursuit of his own brand of justice. The screenplay by Ernest Tidyman based on Robin Moore's bestselling book nicely captures the character of the novel giving all the actors their ""moment"". Gene Hackman's Academy Award turn as Doyle continues to be amazing and Scheider really deserved a Best Supporting Actor nod as well.

""The French Connection"" is still an amazing film and was unparalleled for its grit when it came out in 1971. The film inspired one worthwhile direct sequel (""The French Connection II"") and an indirect one (""The Seven Ups"")and continues to be a pivotal film and redefined the genre.",1235779200,2,5228,4.838745800671893
441986,5,6302238331,"Known for having one of the best car scenes in a film.  Known for it's gritty storyline and showcasing a different side of the police.  ""THE FRENCH CONNECTION"", the winner of five Academy Awards back in 1971 will be released on Blu-ray disc.  And all I can say is that if you are a big fan of this film, ""THE FRENCH CONNECTION"" on Blu-ray disc is the definitive version to own.

The film will always be known for its grittiness, a different take of a New York police detective, a car chase scene, the music and its grittiness.  But what the Blu-ray disc also provides is the making and behind-the-scenes of ""THE FRENCH CONNECTION"" which probably can be a movie in itself because of all that went on behind-the-scenes which was very surprising.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The picture quality is quite interesting for ""THE FRENCH CONNECTION"".  This is one of the few films similar to a Criterion release in which the film is presented the way the director intended.  20th Century Fox did the same with this film.

Director William Friedkin was very much involved in the way the film looked (in fact, there is a special feature on the color timing of the film).

With that being said, the film is the best looking version of the ""THE FRENCH CONNECTION"".  Having owned the first DVD release, the colors are much different.  Friedkin wanted to show the grittiness of the city and thus you get some blues and deep blacks in the color.

But I noticed there was a lot of grain in certain scenes and some scenes looked like a 1971, old film.  Where some viewers may have wanted a cleaned up film, because Friedkin was very much involved in the video process, I would assume he wanted it this way and not so cleaned up.

As for the audio, audio is presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  The film is mainly dialogue-based that comes out clear but if there is one thing that does come clear on your speakers and really stands out is the music by Don Ellis.  ""THE FRENCH CONNECTION"" is known for its jazzy music, so the brass horns definitely come out clear through your surround sound.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

This is where ""THE FRENCH CONNECTION"" shines.  This Blu-ray is just filled with special features on two discs.

DISC 1:

  * William Friedkin introduction to ""The French Connection"" -  The director of ""The French Connection"" William Friedkin introduces the film but also returns back to the area he filmed the movie and talks about how we will see former cast and crew on the special features.
  * Commentary by William Friedkin - I really enjoyed William Friedkin's commentary.  No pausing, just pretty much sets up the film of what's going on and quickly adds certain behind-the-scenes info. on the scenes.  Well done!
  * Commentary by Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider - I was so excited for this commentary but it's not what I was expecting.  Unfortunately, Roy Scheider passed away in 2008 and the two didn't do a commentary together in the past DVD's.  But you do get Gene Hackman talking about his experiences on ""The French Connection"" and then Roy Scheider talking about his experiences.  Gene Hackman on the first 40 or so-minutes and Roy Scheider in the final 40-minutes or so.  They are not commenting on a scenes as it is being played but just offering commentary on the whole experience.
  * Trivia Track - While watching the film, interesting tid-bits of the film are shown at the bottom.
  * Isolated Score Track - For those who love Don Ellis's music in the film, you can strictly isolate the score if needed.
  * Enhances for D-Box Motion Control Systems - For those who have D-Box Motion Control capability.

DISC 2:

  * Deleted Scenes - With optional commentary, William Friedkin talks about certain scenes he cut out.  Most of the scenes were showing different sides of ""Popeye"" Doyle.  How the man really didn't have much friends and sometimes ends up speaking to the informants (like they were buddies), a scene of how Doyle would twist the law to pick up women he fancied,  an S&M scene involving Pierre Nicoli and more.

  * Anatomy of a Chase - The chase scene in ""THE FRENCH CONNECTION"" is what the film will be remembered.  One of the biggest car chase scenes was from the film ""BULLIT"" produced by Philip D'Antoni.  Antoni produced this film and his mandate was that the chase scene MUST be better than ""BULLIT"".  So, Friedkin felt that having a car chase an L-train bus in New York City with all cars and people was amazing.  For one, it can't be duplicated in this age but literally both William Friedkin, DOP filmed this scene without the place being blocked out.  Because Egan and Grosso were well known with the NYPD, they informed their officers a car chase scene was being filmed.  But the actual scene was so dangerous because the cars were going 90 MPH and in one scene (that was used), a car being driven by Gene Hackman was hit by a guy who was leaving to go to work.  Hackman was hit and ended up wrapping the car in a pole.  Hackman and the cameraman were lucky to survive without serious injuries but that was how difficult this scene was.  Friedkin wanted a car weaving around cars and eventually, several times, the stunt cars actually hit them.  So, a very interesting and informative featurette!
  * Hackman on Doyle - It is well known that Gene Hackman's career was born because of this film but what many don't know is that he wanted to quit at one time.  To play Doyle, Hackman had to learn Eddie Egan's way of doing things.  His mindset.  That includes beating up people, calling them the ""N"" word and also he had to go on ride a longs with both Egan and Grosso to see how they worked.  Hackman was so shocked about the police life and he was so distraught that he didn't know if he could play the part.  He and Egan were like oil and water and in fact, Egan didn't want Hackman to play him.  But Hackman managed to pull it off and win an Academy Award.
  * Friedkin and Grosso Remember the Real French Connection - In this scene, director William Friedkin and Sonny Grosso (the detective that Roy Scheider's character was based on) reunite to talk about the film and how it differs from how things actually happened in reality. Grosso does say that the film captured 90% of what he and Eddie experienced.  If anything is more surprising, which is shown in the last minute of the film but in relation to the film and reality is how all this hardwork from the NYPD, the criminals really never had to do a lot of time.  In fact, many were released and some were never caught.
  * Scene of the Crime - William Friedkin goes back to the area where Pierre Nicoli shoots at Doyle.  He visits the same building and the same area and what he was going for during the filming.
  * Color Timing the French Connection - William Friedkin and his video guy show examples of how Doyle wanted to get the colors he wanted for the final Blu-ray cut and how it was accomplished.  Thus you learn that Friedkin was very much involved with this Blu-ray disc video version.
  * Cop Jazz: The music of Don Ellis - Don Ellis is a jazz musician who was known but not very well-known until he did ""THE FRENCH CONNECTION"" and thus this featurette is a tribute to him.
  * Rogue Cop: The Noir Connection - Although James ""Popeye"" Doyle's way of handling things as a cop was very brash, this featurette goes through many films that precede ""THE FRENCH CONNECTION"" and other well-known cops on film that were ""rogue"".
  * BBC Documentary: The Poighkeepsie Shuffle - A lengthy documentary on ""THE FRENCH CONNECTION""  aired on BBC featuring interviews with the cast and crew of ""THE FRENCH CONNECTION"".
  * Making the Connection: The Untold Stories of the French Connection - A lengthy documentary hosted by Sonny Grosso featuring interviews with the cast and crew of ""THE FRENCH CONNECTION"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

When ""THE FRENCH CONNECTION"" came out on DVD for the first time, I was anxiously waiting for it.  And now, watching it on Blu-ray and just knowing how much was put into this release is just amazing.

The film was avant-garde back in 1971.  Gritty, raw and it's a film that can't be made again.  The film showcases the racial profiling at that time and William Friedkin was able to pull of the unthinkable of stopping traffic in New York City to quickly get a shot, using Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso's connections to block out several blocks for a car chase scene with many people and cars still in traffic and it was such a guerrilla-style of filmmaking that was pulled off amazingly.

But this Blu-ray showcases how things were not as peachy keen behind-the-scenes.  From getting the best-selling book to film, finding the right actors to play Egan and Grosso, making sure Friedkin, D'Antoni, Hackman and Scheider were involved in actual busts by Egan and Grosso and just making sure everything looked right.  And also the film had its certain mini-controversies between Hackman and Friedkin, Hackman and Egan, Friedkin's scene with Doyle and Nicoli at the end to problems within the film industry at the time, the film being turned down by so many film companies, turning down so many screenplays, so many actors to play a role and I can see why this film nearly never happened.  So, I found this all intriguing.

The film was great to watch but what surprised me more is how much went into this Blu-ray disc.  Reuniting William Friedkin, Philip D'Antoni, Sonny Grosso and a few others to visit the various areas of where the film was shot, to talk with the crew and movie execs that helped make this film happen.  All of this is included on the Blu-ray.  Ten featurettes which the majority were all quite lengthy, commentary by Friedkin and also to see Gene Hackman, thankful for this film and to see people no longer with us such as Eddie Egan and Roy Scheider also having a part in this Blu-ray disc posthumously.

This Blu-ray disc is everything a fan of ""THE FRENCH CONNECTION"" can want.

It is the definitive version to own and the way William Friedkin wanted people to watch the film on Blu-ray.

""THE FRENCH CONNECTION"" on Blu-ray is fantastic!  Definitely a must own!",1235260800,7,10089,4.586457750419698

441988,3,6302238331,"First the good news: Fox has done a great job mastering this dvd as both the picture and sound quality are very good having been given the THX Dolby Digital 5.1 treatment.  The second disc also has very interesting true documentaries about the original Doyle and Grasso, the former actually having a role in the movie.  I thought the camerawork was very, very good though with excellent play with lighting especially in the late night stake out scenes.  The car chase scene was also very good too.  This next point can also be construed as a negative but the film tried very hard to stay true to the events as they actually happened.

Now the not so good news: this film doesn't age very well as is typical with movies from the 70s the story takes a while to develop and in this case, the movie is shot like a documentary too.  This means that for young movie-goers of today, this film will very likely bore you for the most part.  In keeping as close to actual events as possible, the ending had to be lame with the criminal actually getting away.  Overall, this is a good police movie if you have the patience to sit through the slow unfolding of it and quite frankly I cannot understand how this film won the Oscar for the Best Picture, Actor and Director when clearly another film that actually has aged a whole lot better and is certainly much more interesting that year should have won those three categories: ""A Clockwork Orange.""  Now that was truly film that was ahead of its time and Stanley Kubrick is on another planet when it comes to directing as compared to Friedkin.  Another negative point is the fact that Fox has done it yet again in trying to get you to pay more than is necessary for this by putting on two discs when they could have put on one just to get you to pay more.  They did the same thing with ""M*A*S*H.

Entertaining? Yes, if you have the patience. Best Film of the year? Certainly not.  Ages well for today's audience? Nope.  Good quality sound and picture?  Definitely.  Now you decide if you still wanna get this.",1222387200,,2048,4.435828877005347

The only halfway good part was the car chase scene, but when Doyle almost hit a woman crossing the street, I lost interest in the dynamics because it was so thoughtless.  Then, if you weren't sleep by then, you get to watch the police tear up a drug dealer's car for probably 15 minutes.  What was really stupid was that they completely ripped the car up, upholstery and all; however, when the owner picked the car up, it was in tip-top shape.

441990,5,6302238331,"""The French Connection,"" (1971) opens: we quickly see Brooklyn, New York, a few days before Christmas.  It's brutal: we see a sidewalk Santa shivering at his Salvation Army bucket; a man freezing his touchas off as he works a hot dog cart.  Suddenly we realize they're cops surveilling a dive of a bar, as they tear their costumes off and rush inside.  So begins a nonstop action thriller, one of the greatest crime dramas/police procedurals of the 1970's; one of Hollywood's most celebrated golden eras.

In 1971, ""Connection"" won five Oscars: Best Picture; Best Actor for Gene Hackman; Best Director for William Friedkin (it now appears this movie will be the crowning achievement of his career). Best Writing for Ernest Tidyman, noted author of Shaft, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaft/dp/B00004Z1FX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaft</a>) who wrote ""Connection's"" witty screenplay (Howard Hawks contributed uncredited polish). (According to Tidyman's niece, Kathryn Tidyman, Ernest, although white, ""received an award from the NAACP for his depiction of the character of John Shaft, a black detective. Many people who saw the Shaft films presumed he was black-had to be. He was just a brilliant writer who soaked up everything about the people and culture in the big cities in which he lived during his relatively short life."")

The film received its final Oscar for Best Editing.  The excellent cinematography was by the talented Owen Roizman.  Add to that the fact that it was based on a crackerjack novel by well-known thriller writer Robin Moore.  And the odd fact that G. David Schine, a New York boy if ever there was one, and a central figure during the 1950's Army-McCarthy hearings, gets a credit as  Executive Producer, and you have one flavorful film.

The plot is, of course, pretty well-known; based on a true story of a major 1970's drug bust.  New York was then in big trouble, reeling from drug use, an overburdened welfare system, graffiti, crime, and near bankruptcy.  Hackman plays the always in overdrive New York City Police Detective Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle; Roy Scheider plays Det. Buddy ""Cloudy"" Russo, his partner.  Both stars of the true life drama, Eddie Egan and Sonny Grasso, play minor characters in the film; each advised on the picture, and would go on to successful careers, post Police Department, as advisers to the entertainment trade on police matters.  We see a Bunuel favorite, Fernando Rey as their chief antagonist, smooth Frenchman Alain Charnier; and a Costa-Gravas favorite, Marcel Bozzuffi as Pierre Nicoli, his henchman.  And we get the under appreciated Tony Lo Bianco as Sal Boca, hard luck fall guy.  For an added fillip, we get a couple of scenes of Philadelphia girl group - always loved them-- the Three Degrees.  Plus, of course, we get two of the screen's most memorable sequences: the (elevated) subway/automobile chase, and Nocoli's concluding death on the subway steps.

Most of all, we get what was at the time an absolutely fresh, genuine picture of New York as it then was, as real as a blast of Arctic winter air.  We see a lot of its subways; there's even a poster somewhere in a subway car dated ""1971.""  We see the Empire State Building on the horizon a couple of times, and the World Trade Center going up.  Lower East Side landmark restaurant Ratner's; Ward's Island; The Westbury, and other luxury hotels and restaurants: Charnier sends a cup of coffee out to Hackman, shivering as he surveills him.  Brooklyn has never been better served: Doyle is shown as living in a project there.  My neighborhoods, the places I knew best: the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges,the Brooklyn Queens Expressway and its exit ramps, Hicks Street and Court Street,the  Brooklyn Heights Promenade with its heart-stopping views of Manhattan as Xanadu, right there on the screen. The classic chase sequence begins at Bay 50th Street, in Bensonhurst. Hackman had a real-life car crash filming the chase, at Stillwell Avenue and 86th Street; it was left in.  Friedkin, who was only 32 when he won his Oscar for this movie, has said he utilized documentary techniques to get its edginess; he cut that celebrated car chase to Carlos Santana's hit ""Black Magic Woman.""

441993,4,6302238331,"The French Connection (William Friedkin, 1971)

A quarter century after its release and Oscar win for Best Picture, there's renewed debate over whether William Friedkin's The French Connection is really all that and a bag of horse. And, to be fair, maybe there's a need for some historical context here.

1971 was a very, very good year for Ernest Tidyman; he was the singlehanded progenitor of two entire subgenres of film. First his novel Shaft was adapted for film, kicking off the blaxploitation craze, then he got the nod to write the (Oscar-winning) screenplay for The French Connection, which marked the turning point in crime drama from the sanitized, message-based cop flick of the sixties (think In the Heat of the Night for a good example) to the gritty, realistic crime drama of the seventies. While blaxploitation faded out, the tweaks Tidyman made to the crime drama persist to this day.

Many of the criticisms levelled at this movie are, in fact, quite valid. The first half is slow; it's almost all setup and no action. It doesn't help matters much that character development in this movie is a seat-of-the-pants kind of thing, and so we don't get a real handle on our characters for a while. Not liking the first half is completely understandable. But then comes the car chase, and everything falls into place. It's been called the best car chase ever filmed (though legions of Bullitt fans, of course, disagree), and it's all the better for Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman) chasing not a car, but a train. He doesn't need to worry about following the train; after all, it's on rails. He just has to beat it to the next stop. And in order to do that, he's got to outmaneuver or destroy anything getting in his way. Nowadays, when car chases are measured against the stick of The Blues Brothers, the car chase here seems pretty old hat. But there's still something thrilling about it. Maybe it's the camera work. Maybe it's the fact that Doyle doesn't get through smelling like roses-- both he and the car get pretty banged up. Or maybe it's the fact that he's chasing a train. Whatever it is, it works. After that, once we've got a sense of the characters, Friedkin has a sense of the pace, and there's some action to be had, the movie takes off. It's a rollercoaster ride form there, and it's a ball of fun.

I'm not a fan of movies where historical context is necessary to appreciate them (viz. recent review of Breathless), but The French Connection, after a slow start, stands on its own. *** ",1198108800,3,2510,4.669683257918552
441994,5,6302238331,"Here's the game: if you have nothing better to do, rate the chase scene in this movie with the one in ""Bullitt"". Hackman won a well deserved Oscar in his role as Popeye Doyle, a maverick cop who is highly adept at bringing in ""small-timers"" but never the ""big fish'. Enter a solid tip that Rey is smuggling in a huge amount of drugs from Marseilles, worth millions of dollars on the streets. Doyle springs into action, against the better judgement of his boss and some fellow  officers. One memorable scene after another ensues: the showdown with Rey at Grand Central,the incredible chase scene in Brooklyn, the car stripdown, and the final shootout/recovery of drugs and money along with yet another death of a fellow officer;this time it's his harshest critic. Incredibly, Rey escapes, only to reappear 4 years later in France. Incredible also is that this is a Christmas holiday movie, as the opening shots show. Never seen this movie?

442015,3,6302238331,"In Marseilles France a man watches other men. Somebody has seen him and follows him home to take care of this problem. In Brooklyn two cops chase a man to ask him about drugs. Back in France a wealthy man gives a present to his petite amie. Back in New York Popeye Doyle visits a bar and sees a known gangster. He decides to follow their car. We see how professionals tail a suspect through the streets of New York city. Back in France there is a meeting at the historic Chateau D'If. In New York two policemen arrive at a bar to search everyone [no warrant?]. One man is selected for questioning. Doyle believes a big shipment of heroin will arrive in New York soon. We see a French TV star arrive in New York with his Continental.

The police are able to wiretap that store and a home in the hope of finding drugs. Doyle's private life is shown - a mess. Abandoned and confiscated automobiles are sold at auction. The film shows the classic 3-man tail following the luncheon owner. Two others come into the picture. All are followed. There is big money in this shipment; big money is behind this deal (he knows about the wiretaps!). The film shows many scenes of New York city in the early 1970s. Doyle's cover is blown by subway tag. An auto accident upsets some plans. Then there is a sniper on a building! Unbelievable, but it leads to a classic car chase that is used to fill screen time.

Now they follow the brown Continental to where it is parked downtown in a deserted area. Who will pick it up? The car is impounded and taken in for a search. Nothing is found hidden inside. But why is it 120 pounds overweight? They discover the reason. Frog One drives it to the rendezvous. The heroin is transferred to a new hiding place and money changes hands. But a glitch develops in their best laid plan. An isolated area can act like a closed trap. There is a shoot out to provide added drama. [Believable?]

There is irony when they show the sentences handed out, and the reward for Doyle and Russo. The language in this film stretched the conventions. Was it due to the producer G. David Schine? The action in this film overshadows the weak plot. [Sixty kilograms weight 132 pounds. A quart of water weighs about 2 lbs.

442017,1,6302238331,"As with most movies based on real life, this movie is a poor recreation of the original.  The real French connection refers to a trans-Atlantic heroin trade with roots in the Cold War, organized crime and the CIA.  The history begins in the 1950's.  As the Iron Curtain descends on Eastern Europe, communist parties throughout the rest of Europe make gains in local and national politics.  Their rise is most noticeable in France where they poll well in elections.  In response, the US CIA allies itself with members of France's organized crime network to undermine the French communists in ways both illegal (by both French and American laws) and immoral.  The CIA gets willing henchmen in France, and in exchange they turn a blind eye towards other illicit activities such as heroin smuggling.  Some believe the CIA even aided the drug trade, but this is still a point of contention.  The heroin smuggled from the Port of Marseilles arrives in East coast cities such as New York.  One major effect is the corruption of the New York Police Department.

This movie leaves out the CIA, the Cold War fight, and even the police corruption, and focuses solely on the contact and ensuing conflict between several of the heroin smugglers and two US cops, Buddy and Popeye.  The former is careful, by-the-books, and honest.  The latter is reckless, brutal, violent, and a womanizer.  When released, this movie was groundbreaking in the level of violence involved, bad language, its depiction of police life and police officers (Popeye's character), and was probably the first major movie to revolve around the international drug trade.  Watching it now in the 21st movie, the movie is quite boring.  The dialog is meager in quantity and poor in quality.  The violence is actually tame.  The car chase scenes were soon surpassed in excitement by those in the Blues Brothers (1980).  The character development is minimal and the portrayal of the criminal life is also minimal.  Even the archetypal relationship between the reckless cop and the by-the-books cop has been recreated better in movies such as Training Day and Lethal Weapon.  In fact, the movie seems to be one long series of gunfights between good guys and bad guys.  It sure says a lot about movie quality back in the early 1970s if this movie could get so many Academy Awards.

If one stands aside from the sheer excitement of the film and examines it dispassionately, it becomes apparent that here is ruthlessness which, under normal circumstances, would be regarded as the actions of a crazy man...

Under the arches of the elevated railroad, the Doyle character drives a car like a character gone berserk; if the number of innocent bystanders sent flying and the total of wrecked cars were calculated, it might have been cheaper and more humane to let the villains - and the heroin - escape...

442020,5,6302238331,"A fresh-faced Gene Hackman picked up one of this movie's five Oscars way back in 1971. As with music, this movie is evidence if any is needed, that good art doesn't grow old and this crime drama is one of the most influential movies of a decade that was choc-a-bloc with good American cinema.

Hackman plays a ruthless and unscrupulous New York cop ""Popeye"" Doyle, who's out to bust a drugs ring operating between France and the United States. Doyle's partner Buddy Russo, is ably played by Roy Scheider and the chemistry between the gung-ho Doyle and the more circumspect Russo is something to see. Doyle was apparently based on a real-life detective, Eddie Egan, who, with his partner Sonny Grosso, seized $32 million worth of heroin in 1961. A record at the time.

The language is colourful, as one would expect perhaps from a movie of that era, (not least when Doyle is squeezing the African American brothers for information) and there is violence. The movie is shot on location in New York City, Marseille and Washington D.C. and the urban landscapes gives that added realistic and gritty edge to the proceedings. We get to see the mundane and non-glamorous side of real police work.

This is a classic cat and mouse chase between the good and bad guys and Fernando Rey plays the part of the smooth Frenchman Alain Charnier, perfectly. This is a five star classic crime caper, without a doubt. A genuine urban thriller.

442021,5,6302238331,"Even though there's nothing to say about this now 35-year-old masterpiece that hasn't been said by someone somewhere, I can't resist offering my opinion on the greatest cop movie ever made and, in all likelihood, one of the 10 best films ever made.

How can a film be better than this one? It deservedly won five Oscars including best picture, best actor (Gene Hackman), its script and editing. Film editing is probably the most common downfall of a movie that is the least understood by the average filmgoer. aside from inane scriptwriting, it is editing that either turns individual scenes into something larger that its parts or robs those scenes of their vigor and value by misplacing them in the overall sequence of events.

There are so many good things going on in this film -- the action, ultra-intelligent script based on a real life incident, the acting, the locations, the searing score using knife sharp high strings and bellowing lower strings, and William Friedkin's monumental direction that included the unplanned train chase scene that is now considered the greatest chase in film (""We didn't ask anyone for a permit,"" Friedkin said. ""We just did it."") -- that it is somewhat foolhardy to identify one element as the key to this masterpiece. Still, I believe the editing is what transforms ""French Connection"" from five stars to masterpiece.

I first saw this movie in 1971 during a matinee at an old big city theatre, now bulldozed, the kind of theatre that used to exist before malls took over the industry. While the chase scene was just as riveting then as now on the big screen, it was an earlier scene that more captivated me.

In the second scene, Hackman and Scheider go to a drinking establishment where a Supremes-like trio is singing. The reality and scope of this scene far more overwhelmed me on the big screen than any other. It also happens to be the scene where the two cops first identify bad guy Tony LoBianco -- who followed his success in this film with a lot of appearances on the 1970s CBS cop show ""Kojak"" -- as an emerging kingpin throwing around money with some druggie hotshots.

It probably isn't possible to explain to today's moviegoers what a drug kingpin was circa 1971. Drugs are so ingrained in our culture now, with kids regularly taking them to and selling them in school, that the profundity of such a scene in a film can no longer have the same meaning three and one-half decades later.

The final scene, in the decrepit buildings on Riker's Island, is another ultrarealistic scene that puts the viewer at the scene of the crime and the ongoing melodrama. That inconclusive ending was true and commonplace for its period, a time when the ""antihero"" film was emerging. The popular cop films from the ""Dirty Harry"" series, as well as Charles Bronson's ""Death Wish"" films, were clearly influenced by the antihero aspects of the ""The French Connection"" cops and their futility.

A cast note: Marcel Bozzuffi, the hitman character known as Pierre Nicoli in the film, played a different type of killer two years earlier in the remarkable 1969 French film ""Z"", a political thriller with much of ""The French Connection""'s sizzling energy. And like this film, ""Z"" was also based on true events. Check this out next time you're in the mood for one of the better films of that era.

Far from being a timepiece, this film is just as contemporary today as it was when it came out -- a time when there was no Internet, cell phones or cable television, there was only one American telephone company and gas cost about 30 cents a gallon.

I think we all know what it's about and if not look elsewhere online. What I noticed was this wasn't a film aimed at my generation (Baby Boomer). It was for middle age people at that time tired of what they perceived as permissiveness. These guys were cracking down on drugs coming into our country. This movie came out when Nixon's modern-day ""War on Drugs"" began in 1971. Personally, I think it was a waste of time and money. Even in this film (fiction), nobody served in real time. Four years was the maxim given to one out of several people they were after.

One odd thing I noticed was Popeye Doyle's hat. He wore a pork pie. My dad wore a fedora until sometime in the '80s (he was born 1910). Men started to stop wearing hats when Kennedy came into office because he didn't were one. This film was made at a time men's hats were almost out of vogue.

Before all the glamour that is the Hollywood blockbuster there was THE FRENCH CONNECTION. With no CGI or huge explosions how was this film ever great? during this review I'll tell you why THE FRENCH CONNECTION won 5 Academy Awards icluding Best Picture.

For the starters the film is fast. It holds nothing back with it's quick chases and startling uncovering of the facts the movie is rlentless. It moves along at apace rarely seen anymore. The movie is only about an hour and 40 minutes. Before the story has started it's already done and you're left to figure it out. To have the audience believe that this is really happening the performance of Gene Hackman is truly top- notch. He's not a real complicated character and in the script he's written pretty straight forward but Hackman puts a twist, a lonely side to ""Popeye"" (his nickname in the movie that is typically looked over in the film's first viewing while most are just waiting for the famous car chase. The movie shows modern day problems that people have with the law including racism and Hackman's character chases down and beats a black guy for some intel. The movies shows that cops were just as crooked then to get what they wanted people just din't care. Popeye is an old fashioned cop who does what he has to, to get what he needs no matter the level of damage he creates in getting there.

I read Roger Eberts review to see what he thought of the film and he says the story hardly matters in the film. I have a hard time taking a side in this debate. The movie' plot is sort of irrelevent in a way. The movie really needs no specific story for what it's trying to say. THE FRENCH CONNECTION is in no way light on story, it just takes a back seat to the unfolding of an unknown mystery of the characters and how far they will take or can take of dead ends and stakeouts.

Director William Friedkin (THE EXORCIST) gives the film a fast pace with close ups and chases spread across the scenery of twisting New York. He keeps a certain pace of uncertainty of the line between good and bad just likes 2001' TRAINING DAY. Friedkin's job is not underrated because he won the Oscar but is truly unappreciated.

THE FRENCH CONNECTION is unlike any other cop film ever! It never slows down not even to let you realize how many connections it truly has to modern day motifs of fear, uncertainty, and chaos just like it's main character.",1123977600,2,2504,4.484649122807017

I'm truly amazed at the style in which it was filmed, and amazed that no one else has been able to duplicate it.  In the first place, it's so gritty that you can feel it between your teeth.  Subsequent cop dramas have reached this feel in different ways, but ""The French Connection"" is that rare film that doesn't feel like a film at all; it feels like the viewer is along for the ride, eavesdropping on the characters, and taking part in the action.  Really remarkable.

Gene Hackman's star-making role as Popeye Doyle is the dictionary definition of ""unblinking,"" as this womanizing, racist, over-the-top violent slob pursues a hunch that leads to a huge drug bust, all while an unfriendly fellow detective reminds him often that one of his past hunches had led to the death of ""a good cop.""  No detail is given, just as would not be given in a real-life situation.  The willingness of the director and screenwriter to not overdo these little details is a joy to behold, while the pace and texture of the entire movie are perfect from start to finish.

Connection follows New York narcotics officers Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle and Buddy ""Cloudy"" Russo as they try and track down several men involved with a drug deal that will bring in as much as $32 million dollars.  As sure as Popeye is that something is going to happen, his superiors don't believe him.  This is a gritty, no-nonsense cop thriller that has aged pretty well since 1971.  Always well known for the car/train chase with Hackman speeding along under the L train, Connection belongs up there with Bullitt and the Dirty Harry movies as one of the best cop movies ever.  Don't miss this classic or its sequel which is almost as good.

  In the performance that won him the Oscar, Gene Hackman plays Popeye Doyle, the obsessed narcotics officer who will stop at nothing to bring his man in.  Doyle is not a likable character, and this is part of what makes this movie more enjoyable because nothing is straightforward, everything is open for interpretation.  Fernando Rey is perfectly slimy as Alain Charnier, the organizer of the drug deal that will bring in $32 million.  Roy Scheider is excellent in a supporting role as Buddy Russo, Popeye's partner on the case.  The movie also stars Tony Lo Bianco and Marcel Bozzuffi, two men involved with Charnier.

442032,5,6302238331,"The French Connection is a very good movie that's a true classic. I loved it as did the Academy as it won 5 academy awards back when it was released in 1971:

Best actor- Gene Hackman

Best director- William Friedkin

Best picture

Best film editing

Best adapted screenplay

The movie is based on a true story involving drug trafficking. The story is that of two narcotics detectives in New York played by Gene Hackman (in his first academy award winning role) and Roy Scheider. They find someone suspicious so they wire him which leads them to ""the frog"" (frenchman). This frog has a mean bodyguard and they are from Marseille, in New York to sell drugs. But, since the detectives don't know this for sure, they follow them around. They need proof. I don't want to give away any spoilers but this is a must see. It has a classic chase, a huge stripping of a car, a mysterious white car, a bad encounter with a sniper, and a good ending.

Gene Hackman was brilliant as a mean but good cop. He even dresses up as Santa Claus to get the job done. Hackman's has one classic line ""wanna a milkshake?"" where he mixes everyone's drugs together in a milkshake/ blender after making a bust.

The movie will keep you fixated until the very end with the suspense, the humor, and the constant following of the frog. The 2 disc DVD set has many special features including trailers and deleted scenes. This is a must have for everyone's collection.",1120003200,3,1436,4.517374517374518
442033,5,6302238331,"This fast paced classic was the vehicle for Hackmans prodigious talent and a lot more besides. It tells the story of two Detectives who pick up the scent of a major drug bust. loosely based on an actual case the script traces the unrelenting efforts of these Detectives played by Hackman (Popeye Doyle)and scheider (Cloudy Russo)to identify the main players behind one of the biggest drug importations up to that time. This movie unlike the later sequel was reasonably true to the general facts of the actual case although it chooses to ignore the fact that the drugs were in fact stolen after they had been seized, which was most probably an inside job as they were stolen from the custody of the Police. It is a mystery why this aspect did not form the storyline of the sequel when in fact the script writers chose a completely fictional theme for the sequel, but then I guess what really went down did not lend itself to an exciting storyline especially when the case was never completely solved. The movie itself is carried by the stellar performances of Hackman and Sheider and is further enhanced by a great location and a better than average supporting cast. The part of Alain Charnier or Frog One was perfectly cast with the very fine actor Fernando Rey producing a stand out performance in both movies. It would not do the movie justice if it were merely remembered for the brilliant car chase although car chase buffs would no doubt disagree. That the movie won as many oscars that year is testimony to its greatness. Hackman showed in spades in this landmark performance that he was Hollywood top shelf and went on to excell in many more although none better than this in my opinion. This was Hackmans defining role as was Patton with respect to George C Scott. A very watchable film somewhat drawn out in parts but never boring.

442065,5,6302238331,"There are a million reasons why this movie is such a classic, but I will give two:

Gene Hackman
Cool car chases

This is a classic cop drama with cop bravado, but what sets this movie apart from the norm are the acting capabilities of Gene Hackman and the EXCELLENT bashing of cars.

Come on, if you already watched this movie you don't need me to give you a blow by blow of the story. Suffice it to say that this movie was done very well in 1971 and it still stands the test of time today.

If you are a fan of Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry movies, or Bruce Willis Die Hard movies, you will like this film.",1118361600,2,605,4.0588235294117645
442066,2,6302238331,"Don't be a sheep and listen to all the reviews about how great this movie is, because it isn't. The movie is very slow, the action is not as well filmed as newer films, and although on paper the plot sounds fairly intriguing (a true story of two cops who made the largest heroin bust in US history) the movie falls pretty flat.

Just for a little context on myself, I was born in 1980, so yes I am a relatively younger viewer. However, I am not a big fan of today's special effects oriented, plot light action films. In fact, in my opinion, the seventies were the golden age of filmaking.

Special effects then were advanced enough to make action seem realistic, (but hadn't gotten so good that directors got carried away with them) acting had reached its pinnacle after having the method actors firmly entrenched in Hollywood by this time, and plots were still strong (some would argue weakening in the seventies, in my view they were stronger than the classics, but I can somewhat understand that view).

But what we have with the French Connection is basically a film which is caught between two eras, and succeeds in neither one. The action is closer to classic cinemotography than modern. The acting is fairly good, but with little plot to carry it (unless a two hour limping plot to catch the bad guys is a good plot to you.)

The car chase seen is about as overated as overated can be stated without being a cliche. Here I was bored for an hour and a half, waiting for this car chase, and it really wasn't filmed that well or was that exciting, hardly the best car chase seen in any movie.

If you have nothing but time on your hands and want to see this because everyone else says you should, go ahead. But if you value your time and want to see a film that is both a classic and entertaing, I would suggest the Seven Ups with Roy Scheider. This may be actually be the best car chase in any movie, and although modern movies can film a bit better, I would argue it gives any modern film a run for its money in that department. Also, the film isn't dated, and the plot doesn't put you to sleep. Another suggestion would be Serpico, although also slightly dated to the younger viewers, it still manages to keep its edge, and even during its length and slowtimes, you remain engaged.

Why this film is so popular is beyond me. I think it is a combination of Gene Hackman's acting and a cool sounding name for a film, and then everyone jumping on the bandwagon about this being a classic.

Go ahead and ignore my review and buy it anyway, but anyone who likes a decent paced film with an engaging plot will wish they listened.",1113177600,7,2630,4.377049180327869

It's also one of the only times that I can think of where a car chase scene rises to the level of art.  There is practically nothing in this movie that is black and white.  Even after all these years of cultural and social decline, Hackman's final words to Roy Scheider still manage to disturb.  I was further surprised at how pertinent the themes are and at the unpredictability of the plot turns.

442069,5,6302238331,"Let's just get the plot synopsis out of the way: Popeye Doyle and Cloudy Russo are to NYPD detectives who make the largest heroin bust of their time.  As the title implies, heroin is being smuggled in by a prominent Frenchman and sold through middlemen in Manhattan.  Doyle and Russo do an amazing job of tracking down the bad guys, but unfortunately, the bad guys still claim somewhat of a victory in the end. The movie's based on a true story, but of course, many liberties are taken. Alright, that's that.

This is simply one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Gene Hackman never topped himself with his Oscar-winning performance as Popeye Doyle.  He's able to channel the obsessiveness, harshness, and faux racism of the actual person he's based on so genuinely that you wouldn't doubt that he's an actual hardened detective. Roy Scheider does an outstanding job as Popeye's sidekick Cloudy. He plays Cloudy a bit more mellow than Popeye, but you can tell that he's just as good a cop as his partner. The cast also includes Fernando Rey who turns in a great performance as the French villain.

Of course, the acting is superb, but the cinematography and the action are equally great.  Since Friedkin wanted the movie shot in a documentary style, the on-screen action takes on a very realistic appearance.  This enhances our appreciation of the New York that is seldom portrayed - the non-5th-avenue, real, heroin-infested backstreets of the 60's.  And, yes of course, one of the greatest chases in the history of movies - Popeye in a car chasing the French hitman who's on a train.  There's no CGI here.  And as you'll learn from the commentaries, the crashes you see are real since the filmmakers didn't bother to obtain permits to shoot on the streets and instead just stole the shots.

That brings me to the DVD extras. The commentary by director Friedkin is excellent.  It really gave me a new appreciation for this movie.  Friedkin talks at length about the 2 detectives the main characters are based on, the difficulties in making the movie, and probably most interesting to a film fanatic, the correlations between the movie and the actual case itself.  The commentaries by Hackman and Scheider are also great, but unfortunately, each only speak for about 20-30 minutes. The DVD also has an insightful documentary produced by the BBC about the movie and the actual case.

I'm sorry I'm talking so long, but there's still more to say. There are seven 7 deleted scenes and accompanying commentaries on the DVD. After viewing these, I realized just how revolutionary the ideas behind this movie actually were. The final cut of the movie was controversial enough in its portrayals of drug use, police behavior, and Popeye's racist attitudes, but one look at the deleted scenes will convince you that Friedkin would have pushed the envelope farther if only audiences were ready for it. The most striking of the scenes depicts the French hitman enjoying sadomasochistic activities with a prostitute. That may be par for the course for today's movies, but just imagine what it would have been like back then.

I've rambled enough, but it's only because I love this movie and this DVD. Make sure you pick it up next time you go to Blockbuster or wherever.",1097452800,5,3264,4.81216457960644

Roy Scheider gives a great supporting performance as Cloudy, Popeye's cooler headed partner as does Fernando Rey as the wily Charnier.  Kudos also go to William Friedkin for his sure-handed direction.

After playing Mafia for a couple weeks, I think that the game designers who made Mafia must have been watching a lot of this movie, because there are too many similarities to be a coincidence, not in story, but in setting and in some of the action sequences.

THE FRENCH CONNECTION, if not for anything else, will be remembered as the film that ultimately de-romanticized the noble cop legend. Popeye Doyle (marvelouly portrayed by Gene Hackman) is the anti-cop. He is not a crooked cop by any means. However, he's bigoted, amoral, prone to violence, self-possessed, and oblivious to the rules of police conduct. Norman Mailer once said of bad cops that they are sworn to uphold the law but feel they are above it; that they are supposed to keep the peace, but are inherently violent. That's Popeye Doyle.
The plotline of the film is fairly simple: the police receive information about a major drug operation about to go down, and they try to prevent it and arrest everyone involved. But Director Friedkin infuses the film with the complexities and dreariness inherent in pursuing such a case. I developed an appreciation of the hours of stake-out drudgery that the police go through. And then, of course, there's the danger every policeman confronts.
There's something for everyone in this film, including the greatest car chase in movies (even if the car is chasing an elevated train). Note: the elevated tracks that Gene Hackman drives under are the same tracks that appeared in the opening credits of ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" and, more importantly, they are the same tracks that John Travolta saunters under in the open scene of ""Saturday Night Fever"". If you're interested, those are the elevated tracks of the West End line (now the ""D"" train) on 86th Street in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn.",1086825600,2,1873,4.968152866242038

Watch it and compare it to any of the Lethal Weapon movies, for example.  The acting in T.F.C. is top-notch, from Hackman as well as Fernando Rey and Roy Scheider.  Direction from William Friedkin is super-tight.  The movie just rocks-- it's cliche to write this now, but the plot just won't let you go.  Friedkin was at the top of his game in the early 1970s, directing this as well as THE EXORCIST.
Fans of police thrillers should see THE FRENCH CONNECTION at once-- it's a memorable movie that you'll enjoy, and you'll watch it every few years from then forward.

Hackman stars in his Academy Award-winning role as ""Popeye"" Doyle, a New York City cop who, along with partner ""Cloudy"" Russo (Roy Scheider), stumbles upon a drug ring headed by a Frenchman (Fernando Rey) who uses an innocent-seeming actor (Frederic de Pasquale) to cover the operation.  Along with Hackman's forementioned award for ""Best Actor"", the film also took in Best Director for Friedkin; Best Film Editing; Best Writing (Ernest Tidyman) and a deserved Best Picture.  The chase scenes are outstanding and some of the best ever filmed; Hackman is excellent in one of his greatest roles.

442081,5,6302238331,"To a significant extent, this film is based on a real-world situation in which hundreds of law enforcement officials worked for many months to locate and eliminate the connection between the source of heroin in France and its underworld contacts in the United States. As examined in Robin Moore's book, 112 pounds of heroin (with a then street value of about $90-million) were scheduled to arrived in the United States. Narcotics detectives Eddie (""Popeye"") Egan and Sonny Grosso completed a lengthy investigation to learn who, when, where, how, etc. In the film, Hackman plays re-named Jimmy (""Popeye"") Doyle and Roy Scheider plays his re-named partner Buddy Russo. (Both Eddie Eagan and Sonny Grosso have small parts in the film.) Other variations from the book are relatively insignificant. The situation remains essentially the same. The film carefully follows the extended and tedious period of surveillance which reveals the NYC source; preparations are then completed in anticipation of the shipment's arrival; finally, the connection is consummated and....
Under William Friedkin's brilliant direction (which resulted in an Academy Award for him), this film weaves several separate but related plot threads, both within and beyond the United States, which involve criminal activities in meticulous coordination with efforts by law enforcement officials to respond to them. I was fascinated by the juxtaposition of elegance and luxury in affluent (albeit criminal) society with the squalor and decay of the world within which the heroin will ultimately be distributed. I was also fascinated by the style and temperament of Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) who supervises the shipment in striking contrast with his principal adversary, Doyle, who resembles an enraged bear wearing ill-fitting hand-me-down men's clothing. (FYI, Hackman received an Academy Award for his performance.) Doyle becomes obsessed with destroying the French connection, no matter what. This is most evident during a car chase through the streets of New York which remains the most harrowing ever included in a film. (Even better than the car chase in Bullitt three years earlier? Yes.) All of the acting is outstanding as are the cinematography and editing. The Academy Award for best film was one of five received and each was well-deserved. It is probably impossible to measure accurately the nature and extent of this film's impact on subsequent films as well as on programs produced for television. Seeing it again recently, I was again struck by the fact that it has lost none of its ""edge"" and that Hackman's performance has even more power now than it did in 1971.",1063324800,,2650,5.311904761904762
442082,4,6302238331,"The Tuminaro Case. That is what the law enforcement community calls ""the French Connection"" case of 1968. Two rough-and-tumble NYPD Narcotics detectives named Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso stumbled on a heroin-smuggling ring which spanned the Atlantic and linked the New York Mafia with a French mob operating out of Marsailles, which, if you are not familiar with it, is a great port city in the Mediterranean famous for, among other things, being a stop on the great heroin pipeline between Turkey, Siciily, Corsica, Continental Europe, and the Big Apple. This discovery was the birth of the understanding that the heroin trade was big international business, being conducted on a breathtaking scale, and the efforts of local cops and a few federal agents to stop it by busting junkies and street dealers was as ludicrous as handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500.
In the end, somewhere between 100 - 300 kilos of pure heroin were seized, the ring was smashed, two cops sprung to fame by making the big case (""Went through The Door"", in NYPD Narc lexicon), and the soon-to-be legendary NYPD Special Investigations Unit was created. But at what cost, and to what end?
This is what the film version of ""The French Connection"" examines, changing the names of the players (to Popeye Doyle, played by the great Gene Hackman, and Cloudy Russo, played by the criminally underrated Roy Schieder, respectively) but leaving the basic facts of the story intact. Very few movies have attempted to show the methodology and mind-set of Narc detectives without either glamorizing them or apologizing for them; ""TFC"" does neither. Doyle is a truly disgusting human being, but a [darn] good cop. He has the ego, the spleen, the recklessness, and the obsessive won't-let-go mentality of a pit bull, which more or less typefied the Narcs of the pre-Knapp Comission years. If you want a cop like Doyle off your case, you pretty much have to kill him. And if you try, don't miss.
The SIU, an elite branch of the Narcotics Division, was born during this investigation. No police unit in history probably bagged more hard drugs, busted more big-name dealers, or wrought such havoc with the drug trade in the Big Apple. On the other hand, no police unit in history ever broke so many laws doing it:
the tactics used by Doyle and Russo in ""TFC"" became standard procedure for the SIU: Illegal wiretaps. Shakedowns. Theft of money. Distribution of heroin to informants. Perjury. Extortion. Entrapment. You name it, they did it, and operated with virtually no supervision for about ten years before another famous cop, Bob Leuici, who got his own movie (""Prince of the City"") brought down the house by exposing its inherent corruption. About seventy detectives served in SUI and of them, more than fifty ended up being indicted, and most went to prison. A number killed themselves. In a moment of true irony, several SIU detectives were fingered in the theft of 300 pounds of heroin from the police evidence lockup. The heroin in question was the evidence seized by Egan and Grosso in the Tuminaro Case. So in the end, it was largely for nothing. The H hit the street anyway.
I read some review of this film which question its morality, its supposed affirmantion of the 'war on drugs' and even liken ""Connection"" to the Nazi propiganda film ""Triumph of the Will"" because it seems to endorse the ends-justifying-tactics of Doyle and Russo. These people are missing the point entirely. The French Connection is not politicized fiction, like ""Blow."" It is a real case, the detectives were real people, and these were the real methods they used to crack it. The scene where Hackman chases his would-be assassin all across New York, endangering the lives of about 100 people in the process, says more than any dialogue could about his personality. In other words, this movie isn't about the drug trade, it's about the cops who fight it.

""TFC"" is NOT an endorsement of the war on drugs; it simply lays out what happened here in a dramatized fashion. Like all great movies, it does not tell the viewer what to think but allows him/her to come to his own conclusion. And by the way, the movie most certainly DOES imply that the drug war, or at least this particular battle in it, was futile. The 'what happened to them' blurbs at the end of the film demonstrate this in no uncertain terms.
Looking back I see this is not a proper review of the film but more of a rant. ...
I'm through venting. Sorry. I'll make up for it with this: ""The French Connection"" is a great crime drama, brilliantly acted, superbly directed, and deserves every bit of its reputation as one of the greatest films of all time.

442108,5,6302238331,"It's getting a tad frayed around the edges, but ""The French Connection"" has stood up remarkably well over thirty years, thanks largely to a great cast, a great director (William Friedkin) and a crackerjack plot - not to mention the mother of all car chases.  Only Gene Hackman could have played Popeye Doyle, a straight-up jerk whose bull-in-the-china-closet operating method rolls over everything in his way, including his own colleagues.  Playing his partner admirably well is Roy Scheider as Buddy Russo, whose patience at Doyle's antics sometimes wears as thin as the soles on his shoes.  The two of them are narcs, and they are out to intercept the arrival and distribution of a monster shipment of heroin from Marseilles by a drug kingpin named Alan Charnier.  The movie zips along as Doyle and Charnier attempt to outwit each other; one of the best sequences in the film is Doyle following Charnier along the streets of midtown Manhattan into the subway (native New Yorkers have fun identifying the path they take) and losing him on the train.  Doyle in his own way is as repulsive as the drug dealers he's up against; he's a racist, selfish, insensitive, uncaring about anybody but himself.  But his single-minded mania serves him well in this chase; he'll bring down his prey one way or another.  The classic scene in this movie is, of course, the car chase under the elevated subway that practically defined the term ""car chase""; it's mind-boggling to try to imagine how Friedkin managed to shoot this sequence.  The supporting actors in the movie are excellent; I especially liked Tony LoBianco as the middleman Sal Boca, Arlene Farber as his wife Angie, Benny Marino as his brother Lou (does the family that deals together stay together?), Patrick McDermott as the cool-as-ice chemist testing the purity of Charnier's stock and stamping it with his seal of approval; and above all, the sinister performance given by Marcel Bozzuffi as Pierre Nicoli, Charnier's hitman, who will shoot anyone in cold blood without batting an eyelash.  The cinematography has a kind of grainy quality that enhances the gritty story being played out.  Even though it seems a bit dated, ""The French Connection"" still stands out as one of the high points of American film.",1046563200,22,2262,4.944591029023747
442109,5,6302238331,"Along with the less-gritty, fashionably crafted ""Bullitt,"" ""The French Connection"" set the stage for many crime dramas that followed, and epitomized the genre of the brutal detective story.
A slightly fabricated account of a true drug bust made by real-life New York City narcotics officers Eddie ""Popeye"" Egan and ""Sonny"" Grosso in the early 60s, ""The French Connection"" stars Gene Hackman as Popeye Doyle, a gruff cop who hates drug pushers with a passion, paired with his loyal, sensible partner Cloudy Russo (Roy Scheider in one of two breakthrough roles landed in 1970). After a ""hunch,"" the two ruthless narcotics officers tail a greaser (Tony Lo Bianco) whom they find is connected to a big-time drug broker (Harold Gary). Soon, Popeye and Cloudy have stumbled onto what appears to be an imported heroin deal headed by French gentleman-brute Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey), dubbed Frog One. The plot unfolds to reveal a complicated conspiracy to smuggle 120 pounds of heroin into New York City from France. Once Popeye grabs the case, he doesn't let go, even at the discouragement of his boss (played by the real-life Popeye Egan), all leading to a vigorous and relentless investigation.
""The French Connection"" is brilliantly directed by the then-great William Friedkin (he won the Best Director Oscar), using a unique 'induced-documentary' style that captures the seedy underbelly of New York City, and the real-life story itself. The flawless improvised dialogue is what makes the film so real, topped off by the gritty Oscar-winning performance of Hackman, aided faithfully by nominee Scheider. The movie is one of the most realistic, genuinely engaging crime dramas ever made, capturing the tension among the officers in the beareau, and sheer passion and frustration of the 'good guys,' obsessed with getting their man. Though ""The French Connection"" seems heavily fictionalized when compared to the real case, it remains as real as a crime drama can get...despite a gripping pure-Hollywood car chase that sent the film over-budget.",1046044800,,2044,5.273006134969325

442111,5,6302238331,"The French Connection is among the best films of all time.  It easily earned those five major Academy Awards.  I personally rate this particular work of Director William Friedkin in the top fifty.  Unfortunately, it also has much in common with the infamous racist Birth of a Nation.  I hesitate to compare the French Connection to Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi Triumph of the Will, but others might legitimately make this case.  In other words, a moral person, after viewing this movie, should come away with a conclusion possibly not intended by its creators.  The French Connection, loosely based on a real series of events, was filmed in 1971 when many people naively thought that a victory on the war on drugs was right around the corner.  Many excused the disgraceful behavior of ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and his partner ""Cloudy"" (Roy Schieder) as simply necessary in combatting the international drug cartels.  The ground breaking car chase was wildly cheered and few considered whether it made sense for Doyle to risk the lives of innocent citizens in pursuit of the fleeing criminal.  In another disturbing scene, the two detectives violate the rights of bar patrons who may not have necessarily been involved in illegal activity.  The fact that these folks were Afro-American may be a commentary on the racial attitudes of that period.  One does not need to be a political leftist to be appalled by such disgraceful police behavior.  The editors of the conservative National Review  also decry our nation's ludicrous war on mind altering drug use.
There is something that was deliberately left out of the film: the French Connection case accomplished essentially nothing!  The seized heroin were soon found missing in the police evidence room.  Almost certainly,  these drugs were eventually sold on the streets of New York.  It is now thirty one years later,  and we have yet to realize the foolishness of prohibiting people from choosing to indulge in self destructive activity.  Our current laws have only made matters worse.  I strongly recommend that you see a few other films devoted to the same theme.  Rush, Blow, Traffic, and the most recent Narc, also deserve your time and interest.",1043107200,6,2202,5.027624309392265
442112,4,6302238331,"There is a current idea in Hollywood that can be stated by the axiom, ""never let realism get in the way of the story.""  (especially in the age of CGI)  The French Connection is an emphatic rebuke to this idiom.  The film is engrossing, taut, and suspenseful simply because it is realistic.  Director Friedkin (who deservedly won an Oscar) adds to the realism by using ambient lighting and framing the action like a documentary (apparently he rehearsed the actors separately from the crew, then told to crew to ""find the shot"").  The main credit for the realism, however, lies with Scheider and the Oscar-winning Hackman in the lead roles.  They accompanied real cops to real drug busts for a few weeks to pick up the lingo and techniques.  Friedkin also deserves credit for allowing the actors to improvise and for listening to his expert advisors.
The story is based on a true story, about a heroin-smuggling ring bringing drugs from Europe to New York.  The policemen protrayed by Hackman and Scheider are real people who initiated the investigation.  Of course, the movie compresses 2 years of surveillance and police work into a of couple hours, and the celebrated car-chasing-train scene didn't take place in real life.  However, each individual scene rings true, and you get a good overall impression of what life was like in the mean streets of New York in 1971.
This DVD has a number of extra features, including some character-developing scenes that were cut from the final version (and rightfully so).  Friedkin gives a little info on each one.  In addition, there are two documentaries, both commenting on how the film was made and how it related to the real case.  There is some overlap (especially if you also include Freidkin's audio commentary), but not enough that you get irritated by it.  Scheider and Hackman both have about 1/2 hour worth of commentary as well - Scheider's is the best of the three commentaries, in my opinion.
Therefore, pick up this version of the DVD to get some neat extras.  The video and sound weren't especially cleaned up for the DVD version - the filming was originally meant to be a little shakey and unclear in places - so the DVD maintains his original vision.",1035763200,2,2209,4.79155672823219

The storytelling is very well-done, as we are given signs of both hope and despair as the police find clues leading to when the big drug switch is going to take place.  This movie paved the way for some great film acting careers for Gene Hackman, who's still going strong in movies like ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" and Roy Schieder, who we'll always remember as Chief Brody in ""Jaws,"" a classic in its own right.

442124,3,6302238331,"So having seen all the reviews and heard the hype I was a little dissapointed.  My biggest problem with the movie is this: I grew up watching all the police story/action movies that have been trying to take what the French Connection did and do it bigger and better.  And in almost any category you can name there are other movies that do a better job than the french connection.  This isn't to say that the French Connection doesn't do a good job in many categories, it does.  But while intellectually I can appreciate the genius of the movie for the time it came out (30+ years ago), I can't get really excited about it in my heart (having seen better chase scenes, plots, grittyness, unlikable/likeable characters, etc)
  I am going to go out on a limb here, but I would guess many of the people who are responsable for all the 5 star reviews saw the movie on the big screen (or are far better than I at turning intellectual knowledge into heartfelt excitement) And for them I think it makes sense, it probably blew away a whole generation of people when it came out, and the nostalga of flick and the fact that after 30 years it is still a pretty good movie must make them love it.  I'm not of that generation of people though and it doesn't blow me away. :/
  So if you didn't catch this one back in the day, you probably won't be quite as excited about it as some of the reviewers you see shouting it's praises above all action movies of the last 30 years.

Instead, the movie covers a particular drug deal that Doyle and his partner come across.  You see a seasoned policeman following his hunches and a terrific chase scene.
The best part of the movie is that nothing is over-explained.  If you are used to having the movie go into detail to show you why a character is angry about life, then you will probably not follow this movie.  The script keeps to the snapshot of Doyle's life, but particular scenes will tell you volumes about Popeye Doyle.  The writer did not think it was necessary to spend long segments on the background.

It might be a shot of some homeless guy asleep in a doorway and he's got a brand new shoe shine...or something equally out of sync. That's not the case with this baby.

Although he sited some obvious inaccuracies with the real life events, he did agree that the movie excelled in portaying the overall story with tremendous authenticity and great atmosphere.
And if all this were not enough, what about that car chase to end all car chases? Watch it with the sound turned all the way up and hold on to your seat. You may want to buckle-up, just in case!",1004918400,,1025,4.371727748691099

You know I watsh this great movie over and over again and discover myself stunned to death that Hackman, not a well known acter at the time put on this fabulous preformance. Infact I take back my five star review,and give a six star review whoever disagrees is not a real man.",1003622400,2,442,4.402439024390244
442153,5,6302238331,"While I do not agree with some of The French Connection's Oscar wins (A Clockwork Orange was the Best Picture of 1971), I still believe that this is one of the best action movies ever made. Gene Hackman deservedly won an Academy Award for his performance as Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle, who along with his partner ""Cloudy"" Russo (Roy Scheider) attempt to bring down a narcotics ring. The Elevated train-car chase has gone down in cinema history as possibly the best car chase ever filmed. One of the things that make this film so great is its gritty realism. All the sets used are actual interiors and there was hardly any lighting. Director William Friedkin (Who won an Oscar) had a background in documentary. His technique gives a realistic feel to the movie, as if we are there.
Recently, when my family decided to purchase a DVD player, the first DVD I got for it was the recently released ""Five-Star Collection"" Two Disc set of this movie. The picture quality is excellent. Not a single scratch and no `jittery' frames. There are some scenes that are grainy, especially the opening shots in Marseilles. But this is probably because it was filmed this way.
The second disc is loaded with features. There are seven deleted scenes, which can come with or without William Freidkin's commentary. Most of these scenes are character development scenes. But while fascinating to watch them, after you see them you'll understand why they were cut out. There are also two documentaries: BBC's ""Poughkeepsie Shuffle"" and a special 30th anniversary documentary that covers the French Connection case, Robin Chases's book and the movie's making.
Overall, this is an excellent DVD that is well worth investing in.",1003363200,10,1697,4.916376306620209
442154,4,6302238331,"No need to say much about this film, it is a classic with superb performances and an excellent script.  The cast are all spot-on, with Gene Hackman (one of my favourite actors) fully deserving his Best Actor Oscar.
The 2 DVD set includes 2 documentaries, one 'The Poughkeepsie Shuffle' made by the BBC, and the other I think specially for the DVD release.  Both occasionally overlap in content of course, but are definitely worth watching.  They include interviews with Hackman , Roy Scheider and William Friedkin, and with the two NYPD cops on whose exploits the film is based.
The DVD transfer is very fine for a 30 year old film.  Don't worry about the atrocious grain (which almost amounts to pixellation) in the opening shot of Marseille's skyline.  The rest of the film enjoys an excellent anamorphic transfer, with only slight grain visible in a few night scenes.  This transfer is well up to the standard of the best DVDs of similar period films.  The soundtrack is also excellent.",1002240000,4,989,4.7823529411764705
442155,5,6302238331,"The French Connection is a gritty, tough and unapologetic film that is based on the true story of two New York City narcotics officers who scored the biggest heroin bust in history.  Gene Hackman stars as the rough edged Popeye Doyle.  Popeye is not above doing anything in order to make his bust, whether it be coercion or violent force.  Teamed with his more leveled-headed partner Cloudy, played by Roy Scheider, they follow a hunch of Popeye's to the record bust.  The movie is one of the ultimate cat and mouse thrillers as Popeye and Cloudy stakeout the Frenchmen who are importing the heroin.  The famous car chase scene still holds up even thirty years later as one the greatest ever filmed.  Mr. Hackman is incredible in the role of Popeye and the over the top blind rage and fury he brings to the character is perfect.  Mr. Scheider is also great and his sanguine performance provides a nice contrast to the fiery Mr. Hackman.  William Friedkin's grainy filming style perfectly captures the feel of the movie.  Mr. Hackman won a well-deserved Oscar for Best Actor, Mr. Friedkin took home the Best Director Oscar and the movie won for Best Picture.  After thirty years, The French Connection hasn't lost one bit of its power.",1002067200,5,1234,4.724299065420561
442156,5,6302238331,"This is one of my favorite films and probably the best cop movie ever made, in my opinion. Finally, the film is available on DVD, and the ""Five Star Collection"" gives this classic the treatment it deserves.
I've heard complaints that the picture is still a bit on the grainy side, but I feel that's the way it was filmed. Director William Friedkin was going for a gritty, almost documentary-style feel for this film, and it's appropriate. It's certainly watchable and of the highest quality ever for this film.
The commentary by William Friedkin is very interesting and insightful, particularly to fans of the film. I wasn't too crazy about the times when he would explain exactly what's happening in a particular scene...it seemed a bit condescending. Yes, William, we KNOW there's a drug deal going down. We want the behind-the-scenes stories and that kind of stuff. Still, a very good commentary overall. Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider give interesting commentaries as well, but they don't seem to be ""scene specific""...just casually relating stories of how they came to be involved in the picture and stuff like that.
The extras are fantastic, including deleted scenes with commentary by Friedkin and TWO documentaries, one produced by the BBC that revisits locales and talks with many of those involved. You'll find out basically everything you want to know about the film, and then some.
As far as the film itself...if you haven't seen it yet, rent it and see what the fuss is all about. Gene Hackman fully deserved his Best Actor Oscar portraying narcotics detective Popeye Doyle, whose hunch about some thugs in a local night club lead to he and his buddy Cloudy (the marvelous Roy Scheider) tailing them, leading to a transatlantic drug bust of enormous proportions. The film basically laid the blueprint for the buddy cop movie, but it's never been done so well as it is here.",1001548800,5,1885,4.89375
442157,5,6302238331,"I previously reviewed the movie. Now I'll review this DVD.
I have seen all of them: Terminator 2, Seven, Independence Day. This DVD tops any out there!  There has been a lot of work and care on this package.  The result is a delight!
First the commentary is terrific. I am listening to it right now as I watch it. Friedkin is a great commentator. Unlike other directors who talk about trivial items while the movie is running, Friedkin describes every scene and how it was created. He reveals many surprises as he talks about the movie, such as the classic chase scene. Many of the crashes were actually mistakes and many of the cars in the chase were not involved with the filming. They just happened to be there. The other interesting aspect of the commentary is the revelation of what action scenes were made for the movie and what ones were fact. Many of the scenes which appear farfetched actually did happen.
The documentaries are terrific, also. I especially like the sequences where some of the surviving actors go back and walk around the locations where the scenes were filmed. There's a terrific sequence where Sonny Grosso (the narrator) goes back to the actual subway where the car chase took place and describes it, pointing at locations, and even acting out the final gundown at the stairway. Other locations are looked at also (such as the hotel the villians stay in).
Much is revealed about the making of the movie, such as Hackman wanting to quit after the first day.
Even the deleted scenes are entertaining. Unlike most special DVD scenes, these ones reveal a lot about the characters. Friedkin explains each scene and also why he deleted them.
This is just how a DVD should be made! Movie directors should use Friedkin as a model on how to give great commentary. DVD producers should look at this one as the definitive DVD.",1001376000,3,1844,4.67076923076923
442158,4,6302238331,"There are few films that everyone should own, and The French Connection is one of them. After 30 years, it remains one of the most compelling crime stories ever committed to film, and it's centerpiece car chase is just as thrilling today as it was 30 years ago.
It's a bit of a shame that the transfer isn't quite up to snuff. Like other ""gritty"" films, the transfer suffers from extensive film grain in daytime shots, with the early scenes in France particularly bothersome. Given the advances in DVD authoring, it's surprising to see something with Matrix-level graininess on the market, but this is a quibble that only videophiles will notice.
As for supplements, this disc offers some of the year's best. Two extensive documentaries featuring interviews with many of the surviving members of the cast and crew delve into the true story behind the film and the nature of the production. The BBC-produced ""Poughkeepsie Shuffle"" even revisits the locations as they appear today, offering a nice contrast between New York City then and now.
As an added bonus,  there are seven deleted scenes--remarkable for a film of this age--which can be viewed with or without an introduction from director Friedkin.
The French Connection isn't a kid's film by any standard, but it should be noted that the deleted scenes and the BBC doc both contain language and images that parents probably don't want their young children to see or hear. This isn't one of those ""soft"" R-rated pictures that would pass for PG today.
If you love this film, you need this DVD. If you've never seen this film, you still need this DVD, so that you can experience a masterwork of American cinema with lasting power. Who knew Gene Hackman could be a tough guy?",1001203200,3,1727,4.814814814814815
442159,5,6302238331,"I can't tell you how much I am looking forward to the DVD-release of this terrific film. Anyone who appreciates gritty, police dramas such as Hill Street Blues and NYPD can thank director William Friedkin, who set the standard with this movie. Two years later the same director made the stuffy Academy members start taking the Horror genre seriously with his release of The Exorcist. And Friedkin was way ahead of his time with the 1970 gay- themed The Boys in the Band. The man is quite a trendsetter, not to mention a damn fine director.
Gene Hackman, one of the finest, most versatile actors around, gives the performance of his career as the impulsive, almost maniacal, Popeye Doyle. Hackman's ""balls-out"" performance earned him the Academy Award for best actor. Incidentally, it is the  tenacity of his character which adds to the rush of the famous car/el-train chase. No one is going to take a pop at this guy and just slink away!
And what about the chase-scene? Some, including myself, feel that this is the best one ever on film. Others say it was done better in The Road Warrior; or Bullitt; or Raiders of the Lost Ark; or The Seven-Ups. ( Ronin is mentioned also, but I have never seen it.) These movies all had great chases, but they were shot either in the desert (Road Warrior and Raiders) or largely in the open road (Bullitt and Seven-Ups).  In The French Connection, however, the pursuit takes place in a crowded Brooklyn commuter hub. And appropriately so, as the film is all about the grit of the big city. Working within this challenging setting, editor Jerry Greenberg does a tremendous job of maintaining the continuity of a rather lengthy sequence of high-speed events.
There is more that can be said about this great movie, but I'll leave it at this: Unlike a previous reviewer, I have no trouble discerning how this film earned its five Oscars.",995932800,9,1869,4.712538226299694
442160,5,6302238331,"You would think that a film that earned 5 Academy Awards, including Best Picture of 1971 and Best Actor (Hackman), would have been digitally remastered on DVD long ago.  The film concerns NY Detectives Popeye Doyle (Hackman) and Buddy Russo (Scheider) and their uncovering of a heroin ring that goes a lot farther than New York City.  The action scenes (car chases and especially intense foot chase in the conclusion) are first rate.  Hackman and Scheider are great as partners.  I urge fans to push for it's ultimate release on DVD along with the French Connection II and The Seven-Ups.",984700800,4,587,4.84

That is impressive, especially with such compition as ""The Last Picture Show,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and ""Nicholas and Alexandra.""

442192,3,6302238331,"The French Connection is considered groundbreaking because of its  hard-boiled and gritty style, virtually unseen in crime dramas at the time,  and the elements that compose the film have now probably become something  of a cliche.  If anything, the film should be noted for being the first to  claim that piece of originality.  But the film isn't perfect or as great as  critics said because it does have its fair share of problems.
I'll go  with the flaws first.  My main complaint is the musical score.  It took me  a while to figure out that banging sound in the background was supposed to  be the score, and boy is it annoying.  It really distracts and gave the  film a less riveting feel than it probably should have.
There's also the  strange pacing, which goes from slow to fast at a moment's notice.  There  are also some confusing camera angles that give the film a semi-documentary  feel, which sometimes feels appropriate and at other time inappropriate.  The ending is also a little awkward, though my complaint about that is  actually minor.
It may sound like I'm letting the film have it, but there  are a lot of redeeming qualities the film features.  Gene Hackman and Roy  Scheider are absolutely superb and they create characters more likeable  than I thought possible.  There's also the famous car chase, with Hackman  chasing after an assassin on board an elevated train above the streets of  Brooklyn.  It's an exhilarating 6 minute setpiece that ranks as one of the  top ten best car chases in film history (The tops belong to The Road  Warrior, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Ronin).
William Friedkin can create  riveting tales, and while The French Connection may not be his best work  (I'll save that for The Exorcist), there's no denying the occasionally  audacious successes the film makes.",968976000,5,1815,4.788961038961039

7822767,4,6302238331,"William Friedkin made two truly great films in The Exorcist and The French Connection. This is the latter and it still captures your attention. Two police detectives must tail drug lords in New York. While it is certainly slow to start, The French Connection is filled with intrigue to engage the audience as you piece together the operation and do the detective work along side the heroes. The French Connection pulls no punches showing the mundane to the marvelous in police work. You will never forget The French Connection.

Friedkin's direction is absolutely incredible. The car chase sequence is the often called the greatest in cinema history and I must agree. It's fast paced and thrilling. To The French Connection's merit, the entire sequence with both detectives following the criminals around the streets of New York is equally as thrilling and creatively filmed as the action sequences. Whether you are just watching someone walk down a hall to running down crooks, every scene is shot perfectly. It is top tier direction throughout The French Connection.

The acting is exceptional from both leading men. Gene Hackman gives one of his most intense and intimidating performances of his impressive career, while Roy Scheider scales back his role to realistic gloom and professionalism. They are the perfect foil for each other. Hackman's bombastic ""Popeye"" character is desperate to catch the criminals and so he is willing to lay down the law with a gritty harshness. Scheider's cop character ""Cloudy"" is more relaxed, but equally devoted to his duty as he sticks by his partner to solve the case. Two stellar performances enhanced by each other's determination and supporting aspects. Hackman and Scheider are as great actors that deliver splendid shows of artistry.

The part I think has not held up from The French Connection is the minimalist score that sounds quite ugly and ill fitted. There are tense moments without any music at all that work so well. Then there are the numerous instances where the awfully dated score chimes in to ruin the suspense. It is too little and too abrasive for this movie's more reserved tone. Friedkin should have had someone else score The French Connection.

In short, I recommend everyone watch The French Connection for its excellent acting, complex plot, believable writing, thrilling chase sequences, suspense shoot outs, beautiful direction, and creative cinematography. It is quite a slow burn, but its flames flare up as you go along for the ride. I give The French Connection a fantastic 4.5 stars out of 5 stars.",1525046400,,2574,5.063679245283019
