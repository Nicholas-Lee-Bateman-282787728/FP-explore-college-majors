3424213,5,B00197YZ7C,"I watched this show on local PBS until they took it off and I intend to get every DVD that is issued. The show has a 30 year history and anyone in the family can watch without being shocked by something. To bad that the US networks WON'T come up with something like this. Who would have thought, clean laughs and no violence. What a concept.",1224288000,9,341,4.181818181818182

3424216,4,B00197YZ7C,"I'm eager to see and purchase more of this delightful British comedy series.  However, I'm really offended that in the latest Summer Wine (1977), BBC has inserted several minutes of advertising for other DVDs at the beginning, which the viewer is forced to  endure without the option of fast forwarding.",1221177600,22,303,5.04
3424217,5,B00197YZ7C,"Once again we get another ""series"" of antics from our favorite boys from Yorkshire.

This time we get series 4 which appears to indicate Warner/BBC has gotten the message that we want all the series released in order.  Series 4 has 8 episodes, 6 of which aired in 1977 and 2 in 1978.

Here is the episode list along with the original air date:

Episode 1: Ferret Come Home - 9 November 1977
Episode 2: Getting on Sydney's Wire - 16 November 1977
Episode 3: Jubilee - 23 November 1977
Episode 4: Flower Power Cut - 30 November 1977
Episode 5: Who Made a Bit of Splash in Wales, Then? - 7 December 1977
Episode 6: Greenfingers - 14 December 1977
Episode 7: A Merry Heatwave - 1 January 1978
Episode 8: The Bandit from Stoke-On-Trent - 4 January 1978

The sole reported ""Special Feature"" will be:
A rare 1977 interview with show Creator/Writer Roy Clarke.

Unfortunately, this series does *not* include the episode ""Small Tune on a Penny Wassail"" which aired on 26 December 1978.  This is a ""Christmas Special"" which are not typically considered part of a series by the BBC.  Hopefully we'll see this episode on a ""Christmas Specials"" release.

The picturesque Pennine village of Holmfirth in the Yorkshire Dales is the setting for the antics of our aging delinquents and their oddball friends and fellow townspeople.  Miles and miles of unspoilt moorland, and a breath-taking backdrop to the adventures of Compo, Clegg, Foggy.

As I've mentioned before, if you've not seen any of the episodes before don't be suprised if you are lukewarm to the program upon first viewing. This is a show that grows on you with each episode.

Now that Warner/BBC has blessed us with the next series I have but one request.  Let's get on with it! With 6 months between series it will take another 12 years to get it all released!  I, for one, do not wish to wait that long!

OK... I have 2 requests.  The 2nd is: Stop pricing these short 6-10 episode series the same as series containing 24-32 episodes.  This gross overpricing is typical of almost *all* BBC releases.",1210982400,68,2048,4.613259668508287

Foggy`s part has not matured yet and Clegg and Compo`s parts are somewhat, if not totally, helped by the laugh track.  All this taken into account it is still better than the Blamire years.  The addition of Wesley, Edie, Glenda, Howard, Pearl and Marina really jump started this show and made it a cult classic.  All in all......I love Summer Wine.",1411171200,,469,4.35632183908046

Being a little hard of hearing, especially when it comes to some of the Yorkshire accents, I especially appreciate the subtitles options. I have never been able to decipher the ""closed captions"" feature of my TV or VCR player. With the subtitles option on the discs, I can click ""on"" and then I'm able to understand every word.

I have every Last of the Summer Wine DVD that has been released. I am so excited each time I read about another one on the way.

My only complaint is that all thirty seasons' episodes are not released as one huge collection. I know the Dark Shadows drama was released as a complete series of more than 1,000 episodes. I believe LOTSW has just over 300 episodes.",1363132800,3,748,4.445255474452555

3424301,5,B00197YZ7C,"The first thing you'll love about Vintage 1977 Summer Wine, is that it's 2 disc!  More delight for you money!  I loved walking everywhere with this trio, the green fields, firm stone walls and the arched stone bridge slopping to the brook, and it always flowing just enough to require wellies!  But that side, I'm on the edge of my seat when Nora starts hitting Foggy over the head with her broom!  It's amazing that Nora, with wrinkled stockings & hair in curlers still looks sexy to Compo!  You just love him for persistance!  But the best in this series is Flower PowerCut!  I only wished that Foggy, Sid, Compo & Clegg would have played their flute longer!  They were actually very good! And when they ""fall"" for the joke Clegg played on them to get them to play to flowers in a vase in Sid's Cafe', it was a treasure!  You also get to travel in a rented car for a road trip, and of course watch three grown men try to read a road map!  You will truly enjoy every minute of this collection!!!

3424302,5,B00197YZ7C,"There is an interview with Roy Clarke in this set. The disc quality is good. I suggest stopping a show at the end credits to avoid having to watch trailers and BBC spam at your next viewing.
The earliest LOTSW shows were my favorite with the Blamire character. It seemed that by 1977 the shows were themed around Foggy coming up with some ""stupid Pillock""idea and forcing Compo and Cleggy to do the dirty work whilst he avoided any labor. Even to the point of trying to hurt Compo and thinking it was funny. But these early episodes were far better than the later ones. You still had Wally and Sid. The snobbish inventor had not come on the scene. And Last of the Summer Wine indicated early retirement,not elderly Blue Hairs as the show eventually became. The early shows still had some precious Yorkshire flavor,with ""Thee"" and ""Thy"" still pronounced. This is an enjoyable series if you are into laid back BBC comedy with great realistic country scenery as I am.",1318032000,,964,4.6104651162790695
3424303,1,B00197YZ7C,"The Brits can do marvelous comedy with flare and panache. Unfortunately they can also do banal, inane comedy. This definitely falls into the latter category. I returned it after only one episode. Noisy, crude, pointless, not even funny.",1297382400,,236,5.2368421052631575
3424304,5,B00197YZ7C,"The series Last of the Summer Wine is consistently warm, funny character-driven humor.  At the center is a trio of retired men who get into one major scrape per episode (and you get eight or so episodes per DVD pack).  They are supported by a group of neighbors whose hobbies, foibles, ambitions and aversions speed them on their way, then bring them up short with a crash and a bang.  Because the story relies on recurring characters, the viewer may need a few episodes to prime the pump, so to speak.  The time is well rewarded.

For those who find British humor to be like Guiness Stout, a taste not always easy to acquire, rest assured that this is a much milder brew.

The characters include a retired ex-soldier with mild delusions of competence, a scruffy idler with a never-ending crush on the battle-axe who lives upstairs, an everyman whose good sense stops just short of keeping him from getting between the first two, a shade-tree mad scientist whose machines even work once in a while and his fastidious housekeeping wife, a henpecked amateur philanderer complete with wife and outside interest (who never actually DO anything), and a storekeeper whose sales tactics put the trap-door spider to shame.

Roy Clarke, who writes the series, described the central trio as ""the world's three oldest adolescents.""  Not a bad description.

Highly recommended.  I'd love to see the entire series released as a single, complete set.",1272844800,21,1436,4.872427983539095

3424319,5,B00197YZ7C,"What can one say?

This comedy series has been shown regularly for something like 30 years! Obviously, it has a quality that many millions enjoy - myself included.

Those with a strong liking for 'slap-stick' might be disappointed but, even this is not entirely absent from this multifaceted comedy series.

Who'd have thought that a main storyline depicting the adventures of three retired, and extremely unremarkable, characters could hold the nation's attention for 30 years? However, these adventures do this, with huge success.

Quaint, rustic, innocent, down home, old time, all these terms - and others - can be used, with justification,in relation to this wonderful and endearing series. Although some story-lines are fairly predictable, surprises abound and the three main characters never fail to enchant us with their banter.

If you find you enjoy one episode, you will enjoy the entire 30 odd series'. If you find you don't enjoy an episode (a doubtful eventuality) you might as well not buy any others. One of the great attributes of this wonderful series is its consistency - a superbly good consistency!",1239494400,3,1119,5.1602209944751385
