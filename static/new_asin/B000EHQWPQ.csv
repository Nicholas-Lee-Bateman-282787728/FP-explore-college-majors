2520171,5,B000EHQWPQ,"I've read all the reviews before purchasing this movie and all of them have a great feedback on the DVD, but say little about what the movie was about exactly, so I bought this movie and watched it, so anyone else who wants to purchase this movie has to read this review first to really get the full story.

This movie is about two juveniles who are working out in the middle of the Mojave Desert at some boot-camp like facility run by a two-star general. One of the juveniles happens to be the rebellious son of a famous senator running for reelection, so for the general, catching them both is a very big deal for him.

The two guys boost a crappy pickup truck with an outdated map that gives crappy directions. The truck soon breaks down in the middle of nowhere of the desert, so while the guys are trying to think about their options at this isolated rest stop, a car pulls up with two LDS missionaries inside. One of the missionaries had been eating Twinkies in the heat, so the aftereffects send him running for the bathroom. As the companion goes to help him out, both guys take the car and roar off down the road towards the newest civilization, which happens to be a town called New Harmony.

The guys decide to don the extra missionary suits and go along with the flow while deciding out their next plan to escape. The kind, elderly bishop that greets them tells them that they are the first missionaries to be in the town in two years, and both guys are startled by the set of missionary rules that they must follow. (No contact with single women, no coke, no fun for them whatsoever.)Justin, the senator's son, seems to like the waitress girl who owns the local diner, but their ""friendship"" is off to a rough start. The worst part for them(and the most humorous) is that they must begin their tracting throughout the town and teach lessons about a religion that they know nothing about, like the Word of Wisdom and the covenants of Joseph Smith.

Yet, the danger to exposing their identity is on the horizon. With the general out looking for them and the two REAL missionaries hot on their tail, the two men are aware that they have very limited time with the people of New Harmony. But the town and the people seem to grow on them in the end. Like the other review said, there is an ass-kicking with several redneck fellows by the two ""supposed"" missionaries, as it appears that the rednecks had driven out the other set of missionaries two years earlier, and with that comes the confession of who both guys are, followed by the arrival of the general, the senator, and both of the REAL missionaries. But even with their punishment over, both boys feel like they owe something back to the town of New Harmony for all that's happened.

This is definitely a five-star rating, and the movie is very humorous and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. LDS or not, you will definitely enjoy this movie!",1295222400,15,2925,4.45981308411215
2520172,5,B000EHQWPQ,This one is so funny that I let several people watch it and they all laughed their heads off.  Never have we seen LDS Missionaries beat up a bunch of rednecks!  Good movie.,1273104000,,172,4.181818181818182
2520173,5,B000EHQWPQ,Perfect cast for a great comedy.  this movie is hilarious. although sometimes it's obviously an indie film.  Rodney Henson does great in his directorial debut. hope to see more films from him.,1240963200,2,192,4.96875
2520174,5,B000EHQWPQ,"This is a great film for the young LDS. I enjoyed it by myself, I would have liked to see the ""real"" chapel.",1219708800,6,108,3.739130434782609
2520175,4,B000EHQWPQ,"I had heard this was pretty funny, and it didn't dissapoint, altho it was pretty predictable as well.  Nice movie to veg out with.",1175731200,6,130,4.416666666666667
2520176,5,B000EHQWPQ,"A surprising depth of talent marks this film from the beginning. It is alternately funny, touching and always wholesome. I watched it with my wife and six year old and we all laughed, especially at the parts with the genuine missionaries.",1175558400,10,238,4.829268292682927
2520187,4,B000EHQWPQ,"Even my husband liked this movie and he usually doesn't like LDS comedies.  It was respectful of our religion,  yet very fun.  Both my husband and I felt that the ending needed to tie up loose ends a bit better, but over all it was very cute.",1403481600,,242,4.1063829787234045
2520188,4,B000EHQWPQ,"Unlike ""Baptist at the Barbeque,"" also by Halestorm Entertainment,  which was a total waste of money and one of the worst film I have ever saw,  ""Suits on the Loose"" has more acting depth and is a more enjoyable and entertaining film to watch. While one has to cringe at the occasions in the film when the actors trying to play the role of LDS missionaries actually have to perform missionary duties, there are some very good parts to the movie, especially as the Baptist overtures by one of the main actors and the LDS playing actors reacting to them. The film is a step above most films of this LDS comedy genre, such as The Single Ward 1 &2, The Best Two Years, and The R.M., so if someone wanted to buy only one any of these LDS themed comedy files, I would select this one for the family. Note that the film does requires some LDS cultural and spiritual background to understand all the jokes as they are not explained further in the film, (reason for only four stars out of five), such as the M.T.C. (Missionary Training Center) being called the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, so being familiar with the religion and culture definitely does help to enjoy the film. comedy",1390176000,,1171,4.492957746478873
2520189,4,B000EHQWPQ,"This is pretty funny.  I found the ending a little weird/disappointing, but still worthwhile.
My 10 - 16 year old grandkids love it.  I'm not sure you would get it if you are not LDS.",1386547200,,183,4.2
2520190,5,B000EHQWPQ,"As with the other comedies we have bought that have LDS aspects in them, this one got us rolling with laughter as well! Hilarious situations that come back and turn bad situations to good.",1381968000,,188,4.5588235294117645
2520191,5,B000EHQWPQ,"Although I'm not of the LDS faith ( Mormon ) I live in Utah so I can relate to the humor of this LDS movie.
Seller was a pleasure to work with.",1376956800,,143,3.5
2520192,4,B000EHQWPQ,This was a good movie as I expected it to be. I would have liked to see a bit more involvement from the veteran actors but it was still done tastefully.,1373846400,,152,3.935483870967742
2520193,4,B000EHQWPQ,"I think it could have been done better towards the end. It's almost like they had this good story going, then didn't know how to end it.",1372377600,,136,4.074074074074074
2520194,5,B000EHQWPQ,"Great show with humor and a thoughtful, subtle message that shows character is built thru hard work and perseverance, not running away from a task set before you. Good message to young people, with a comical touch. I am not a Mormon, and this show does not overtly push any belief system ~ it just is a clean, funny, family-friendly viewing DVD.",1338854400,,345,4.580645161290323
2520195,5,B000EHQWPQ,This was a great family movie of the change in a couple of wayward youths turning to the good. Very good moral to the story line and I highly recommend it to any age. ESPECIALLY YOUTHS.,1323475200,,185,4.166666666666667
2520196,4,B000EHQWPQ,"This is a fun movie that everyone can watch without the worries of today's unmodest and lanuage and adult situations. It has good morals and makes you smile.
The description on movie is really clear. I thought the two missionaries that are the real ones were funny and the two imposters were pretty fun together.",1305244800,,312,4.6909090909090905

8110026,3,B000EHQWPQ,"In my opinon this movie is as funny as some of the other ""mormon"" movies on the market. Most of the ""mormon""  films (Singles Ward, The RM) go over the edge with exaggerated comedy that it isn't believable, even from the start. That's the appeal of that particular genre. It's supposed to be purely funny.

In Suits on The Loose the filmmaker made a stab at the believable but ended up being ridiculous. There is no way that the behavior of these two ""missionaries"" would have gone unchecked by other members of the church. The funny parts weren't funny enough to compensate for the unbelievable parts. The result was a mediocre film that wasn't really that funny or touching. It was worth a watch but I wished I hadn't purchased it.",1477872000,2,732,4.580152671755725
8110027,5,B000EHQWPQ,It was good,1475971200,,11,3.0
8110028,5,B000EHQWPQ,"I've watched most of these Mormonwood comedies and this one is definitely my favorite. Most of the others are decent enough and usually entertaining, but often suffer from slow or awkward pacing, or comedy that feels too forced. This movie has a few brief moments of this in the first half, but overall I found the story and the characters very charming, and the comedic bits very well done. It's a predictable and familiar story, but pulled off very well. The character development of the 'bad boys' is great, the love interest actress is adorable, and the two wandering missionaries are hilarious. It's the one (LDS-esque) movie I'm looking forward to watching again soon.
