8316895,3,B0001YJ9ZC,"the strategy is less moves and stuff though a better explanation (slow, repeated). Good for the music explanation (few other videos do it). Good for VERY BASIC capoeiristas with no instructor, but a bit ""poor"" on the quantity of moves, kicks, takedowns. I was a bit disappointed just on that. If you are doing capoeira at an average level, it's not worth buying it. Instead if you are about to start off capoeira, I suggest you buy this dvd. The price anyway is too high for  a ""copy"" style dvd (purple layer: are you serious?).",1122940800,,528,4.557894736842106
8316896,5,B0001YJ9ZC,The instructor in this video is from Brazil and now lives in New York and teaches students in that area. He is very illustrative and clear about the techniques and terminology. Has really helped me improve my techniques and form in ways I never dreamed of.,1090281600,,256,4.586956521739131
8316897,5,B0001YJ9ZC,"I loved this video because It shows what the real capoeira is all about, weather you are a capoeirista or not, beginner or advanced! It has unique techniques never seen in any other capoeira tape out there....the music and girls are amazing too...
a must watch",1029542400,,260,4.673913043478261
