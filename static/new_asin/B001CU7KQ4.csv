3520108,5,B001CU7KQ4,"This program showed how the last B-29 mission inadvertently interfered with a group of military fanatics that attempted to thwart the Emperor's attempts to surrender.

While it might not be as detailed as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Japan-s-Longest-Day/dp/B000GDIBQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Japan's Longest Day</a>, it's easier to watch (IMO).  I'm glad I have both.

It's ""letterboxed"", but it upconverted well.  It's a DVD-R, and it isn't cheap, but it is a worthwhile addition to a WWII library.  Get yours while it's still available.......",1303776000,5,593,6.64935064935065
3520109,5,B001CU7KQ4,"I saw this video at the air museum in Tillamook, OR, I learned things about WW11 that I had never heard before, and my husband as well. Since we were both in our 60's and 70's we were surprised that we didn't know some of these facts. And besided that, my husband is a real history buff and a veteran of this war when he was in the Navy. I think it is a great movie and worth seeing.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/History-Last-Mission-The/dp/B001CU7KQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">History -- Last Mission, The</a>",1222560000,7,551,5.4186046511627906

8289393,5,B001CU7KQ4,"This the last account of the final days of World War II The last mission deals with the men who flew it as well as the Japanese side of the war. They say that the 1st World War was the war to end all wars, in reality it was the prelude to World War II and the devastation that changed the World. Our Young people today, have know idea of the cost of war. They have no clue as to its affects. If you choose to view this movie, you will gain the respect of war which is still needed today. Each man involved it went through his own private Hell. Many of the men who fought in this war are no longer with us. It is good that we remember this portion of our history never losing sight of it, less we ever have to do it again.",1396656000,2,721,3.8456375838926173
8289394,4,B001CU7KQ4,"This is an excellent History Channel color reenactment of the final air raid of WWII which coincidentally corresponds with Japan's Longest day. This documentary parallels the DVD ""The Longest Day"" but is more concise. It covers an air raid that happens to fly over Tokyo, not to bomb it but on the way to a fuel depot. An air-raid siren shuts down the lights in the city and helps to thwart a coup that would have stopped the Japanese surrender. The 100 minute show outlines the mission itself and interviews the pilots that were flying the B-29 and provides insight into the bombing runs and well as giving a different perspective as to the events of that fateful day.

However, as good as the show is it is overshadowed to some extent by the poorly made DVD. There are several of these badly made DVD made around the same time by the History Channel and they need to remake all of them. The problem is the DVD is designed to show letter boxed on a 4x3 TV screen with actual black bars recorded on the DVD itself instead of letting the DVD player do it. Thus, on a modern 16x9 screen the image is stretched to the edges of the screen but the black bars are still there, so everyone looks stretched out like they have gained 30lbs and the visible screen resolution is only a scant 300 pixels high instead of the 480 it should be. You can probably adjust the TV or DVD player to keep it from being stretched but then you still have a tiny image. For what they charge they should do better.",1396224000,4,1488,4.35251798561151
8289395,5,B001CU7KQ4,Well done and presented a lot of information few Americans were aware of before this video was released.  I highly recommend it.,1392854400,3,128,4.818181818181818
