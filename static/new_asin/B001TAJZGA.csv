8340925,2,B001TAJZGA,"A not very interesting melange of family interactions and problems of religious rivalry and assimilation in a modern European French-speaking country.  There are some mildly humorous aspects and intermittent pathos, but not enough drama or comedy to maintain full interest.  Surreal dream scenes do not contribute much.",1263340800,2,319,5.76595744680851
8340926,5,B001TAJZGA,"In ""Rashevski's Tango"" we meet a French-speaking, semi-Jewish Belgian family asking all the questions about Jewish identity that American Jewish families ask. The film feels like a mature Woody Allen in the bittersweet era of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crimes-and-Misdemeanors/dp/B00005AUJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crimes and Misdemeanors</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannah-and-Her-Sisters/dp/B00005O06J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannah and Her Sisters</a>."" But unlike Woody Allen, who tended to telegraph the personalities of his main characters from one film to another, ""Tango"" director Sam Garbarski quickly jumbles our assumptions. I found myself chuckling unexpectedly within minutes of the opening credits.

Like many contemporary Jewish families--the Rashevskis have sprawled around the world and have become entangled in all sorts of complex relationships. There's even one grandson hoping to marry a Muslim girlfriend. This comedy could quickly sink into offensive humor--except that everyone in this story is sincerely struggling to understand their collective Jewish roots. The event that launches the movie--and sets off all the soul searching--is the sudden death of the family's grand matriarch, Rosa Rashevski.

The moment she dies, her sons seem completely lost! They can't even agree on whether Rosa would have wanted a Jewish funeral. Soon, they discover she did, indeed! And everyone in this sprawling family has to redefine roles, hopes, desires--and their future. There's also a rogue of an elderly uncle who now carries the bulk of the family's history on his shoulders. He steals almost every scene in which he appears--with just the right blend of elegant style and gutsy chutzpah.

Here's what I mean about the Woody Allen twists and turns: In one storyline, an adult granddaughter feels a strong calling back to her family's Jewish origins, but discovers she's not really as Jewish as she thought. Meanwhile, her gentile boyfriend already has started his own conversion process to Judaism--and discovers that he may wind up more Jewish than the Rashevski girl he hopes to marry.

Pretty quickly, it's obvious why the comedic metaphor is a tango--and we do see a little bit of the dancing before the film ends. It would have been all too easy for writer-director Sam Garbarski to fall into stereotypes, yet at every turn he places his toe solidly on the floor and turns away from easy jokes. For instance, the matriarch's two sons? They could have been two-dimensional Jewish worry warts with stereotypical interactions. Instead, these men will surprise you, including their chosen forum for their heartfelt interactions: As insomniacs, they both wake up at 3 a.m. and play chess over the telephone while pouring out their anxieties.

The movie is refreshing and raises all the questions that so many people are raising today.",1256774400,6,2952,5.808314087759816
