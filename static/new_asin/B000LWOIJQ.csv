8164747,5,B000LWOIJQ,"My kids love Babar and are always asking about other stories about him it is so nice to be able to get a Babar that is not only in French and plays in region 1.  Please be aware that the video is not about Babar as it is about his children, Arthur and friends.  Babar does come into play, but the Babar was an older elephant and by using his children the stories are made more significant to little ones.",1218067200,,404,4.0375
