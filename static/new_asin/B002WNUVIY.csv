BY MIRIAM DI NUNZIO Staff Reporter, Chicago Sun-Times

At the beginning of ""For Love of Liberty,"" an onscreen title card bears a simple yet potent statement: ""Let it be said that the Negro soldier did his duty under the flag, whether that flag protected him or not.""

Thus begins the four-hour journey of Frank Martin's milestone documentary, covering every U.S. military conflict, from the Revolutionary War to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Through historical documents, letters, diaries, paintings, photographs, telegrams, re-enactments and dramatizations, Hollywood lends its voices to the stories and anecdotes of the African-American men and women of the U.S. armed services. Among the voiceover talent: Morgan Freeman, Sam Elliott, Kris Kristofferson, Ruby Dee, Robert Duvall and James Garner.

The history lesson imparted here is brutal and eye-opening, starting with the very first African-American war casualty: Crispus Attucks in 1770, an escaped slave who was shot during the Boston Massacre, among the outbreaks leading to the Revolutionary War. We learn of the colonial Minutemen, black and white enlistees who fought side by side for the foundling nation's independence, even though blacks would not share the same freedoms in the aftermath.

We learn, too, of the earliest rumblings of racism that declared blacks were too cowardly to serve in the colonial forces, a danger to their masters if given weapons -- all this from Gen. George Washington's dispatches.

The film moves on to the War of 1812, ""the war over the seas,"" where British forces recruited Negroes, promising freedom if they fought against the United States, which still denied them their freedom. There were few takers. Later, in the Civil War, as Negroes pleaded to enlist, they were rebuked, though most chose to fight ""unofficially"" for the Northern cause. Later, when the Southern forces needed troops -- of any color -- as heavy casualties demanded replacements, Southern slave owners were quick to allow their ""property"" to enlist because a dead slave could easily be replaced.

And so the documentary, hosted by Halle Berry and narrated by Avery Brooks, moves from war to war as blacks fought for a country that still denied them equal rights under the law. As another voiceover relates, in 1965, during the Vietnam War, black soldiers marched in Indochina, while in Selma, Ala., black civil-rights protesters also marched.

We learn of Pvt. William Carney of the Massachusetts 54th Regiment, the first African American to receive the Medal of Honor -- in 1863. We learn of the men of the 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion, the first black troops in WWII allowed to engage in battle, specifically the D-Day invasion, where they launched hundreds of dirigibles to shield Allied ground forces from the German Luftwaffe. We learn of the Buffalo Soldiers, among the first of 30 all-black combat units to arrive on Korean soil as that war began.

There are the faces of the all-black WAC units; the Tuskegee Airmen; the men of the U.S.S. Mason, the first commissioned Navy destroyer manned predominantly by blacks. The faces spill past on the screen, their stories at times horrific, at times appalling, at other times filled with hope and courage and honor.

They say history speaks for itself, and this part of our military history has never been so eloquently voiced, so searingly brought to our consciousness. If there is one DVD that can help shed meaningful light on Black History Month, this is it.

Note: ""For Love of Liberty"" also will air at 8 p.m. Sunday and Feb. 14 on WYCC-Channel 20.",1265328000,41,3602,5.1192504258943785

4007534,5,B002WNUVIY,"I just finished viewing an advance copy of Frank Martin's extraordinary movie.

I am emotionally drained.

I am both sad and mad:

  at myself, for not having a better command of our history

  at America, for allowing this treatment of our citizens and Armed Forces members and their families to happen over and over again.

What a shame that this story, won't make the front page of the paper or TV/website news!

4007566,4,B002WNUVIY,A well-done overview of the triumphs and struggles of blacks in the military.  Should be required viewing in American History classes.,1298764800,,134,5.380952380952381
4007567,4,B002WNUVIY,"This is a great documentary, telling the story of black soldiers in all of the military actions of US history.  It's great to have this continuous thread rather than just looking at individual wars.  The filmmakers do an excellent job providing the actual words of the participants, read by an all star cast from letters of soldiers as well as speeches of presidents and others.  All this is done in narration and voice-over, while war footage and stills are shown.  Occasionally, time is taken to show the military action in context with events at home - such as the MLK assassination.

A few things keep me from giving it 5 stars.  I found the musical score really awful in many places.  A few really odd pieces were especially distracting.

I found it odd that there were no interviews by soldiers reflecting on their service - only letters are read.  This is a real weakness in my opinion.  I also would like to have heard a bit more on the experiences of veterans returning home.

I also also thought that sometimes the film covered the stories of individual soldiers too heavily.  These men and women are true heroes and I don't mean to imply otherwise.  But sometimes the stories of who won what medal seemed to come at the cost of the larger social implications of American policy which are often mentioned quickly.  This is probably a personal preference - I'm sure there are those viewers who will enjoy the film for this reason, especially since black soldiers are often those whose stories are not told.  For me, the individual stories became repetitive and cliche.

It's a really good film - I'm glad I watched it and would encourage others to do so.",1298592000,,1663,4.6438356164383565
4007568,5,B002WNUVIY,This is a wonderful series!!!  I'm watching it with my son - and have just purchased it or my collection.,1296777600,,105,4.25
4007569,5,B002WNUVIY,Every one should see this DVD especially our children.  So much of our history has been omitted from the text books and this DVD fills in a lot of the gaps.  Again this should be required viewing in all schools of America.,1271376000,2,222,4.261904761904762

4007572,5,B002WNUVIY,"Too much of history is was left out the history books.
I'm thankful and graceful there is people that care
enough to reveal this history even much time is passed..",1267660800,2,163,4.466666666666667
4007573,5,B002WNUVIY,"While at the Command and General Staff College (CGSC) in Fort Leavenworth Kansas, I researched and wrote my history papers on the topic of the African American soldier from the Revolutionary War thru Operation: Iraqi Freedom.  It was met with a luke warm reception from my instructor.  Over the years numerous academists have researched and wrote similar pieces on the African American soldier during various periods of our nations wars and conflicts with similar reception.

For whatever reason these efforts were met with little fanfare and with little or no attention paid to them.  But thank the Lord finally someone has endeavored and successfully told the story of our country's African American soldiers and heroes.  It tells of the story of our never dying hope and reasoning of a brighter tommorow, if we prove ourselves as loyal countryman and patriots today.  War after war, conflict after conflict we proved ourselves only to see little change back home in our communities.  And although the military has always been an engine of change, the engine often sputteres with injustice, unfairness and racism.

But this story is so much more than that, it celebrates the bravery and sacrafice of our African American patriots.  But perhaps most importantly in a day where our story-tellers are diminishing and our youth need a guiding beacon.  This magnificent documentary provides our young with examples of men and women to aspire to immulate.

I had the AWESOME opportunity to meet the director and the historian.  I'm so very incredibly proud of them and those who have lead the way for soldiers like me.  Thank you Gentlemen, for a job extremely well done and a work this country can be proud of.",1267488000,,1707,4.989399293286219
4007574,5,B002WNUVIY,"Having just watched this astonishing documentary, I am somehow ashamed, angered and exhilerated at the same time at this marvelous production.  As an African-American veteran (USAF, 1977-1986), I have personally seen and witnessed the dilemma that every black service member faces when they serve in the U.S. military.  While progress has been made, I am reminded of the times that my father faced in WWII while serving in the army.  He would tell about the indignations and racist episodes he had to endure while serving his country.  A country that considered him inferior, unintelligent and a social pariah.  However, my father persevered because he loved his country and his family.  He has passed away but I think this documentary does him and all African-American service men and women the long overdue justice they deserve.  Rest in peace, Daddy.... know that your country appreciates your sacrifice and as a proud son,  I do too!!!",1266105600,7,939,5.091503267973856

8383298,2,B002WNUVIY,"I had already purchased this product once. I had lent it out to a good friend, and he had really loved it because he said his children could really relate with the history behind it. So I let him keep it. I ordered another copy but a used one and unbeknowns to me i received a "" High School version"" that was considerably shorter and a lot less information. If I would have know that there was a shorter condensed version I would have bought the NEW Version, which in fact was the complete version. I'm not sure if you are a where, but there are two versions. But they are not listed on your AMAZON website as such. I'll have to order the complete version at another time.

That being said, I believe i have watched it 20 times. And everyone that I lend it to just loves it.....!!!",1357862400,,781,4.206666666666667
8383299,3,B002WNUVIY,I think this was an excellent DVD and should be used in grade school history classes.  So little is known about our history as it really was and I think this would be a great teaching tool.,1301270400,,189,4.108108108108108
