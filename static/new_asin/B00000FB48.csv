8223147,3,B00000FB48,"Set in a country that has had problems since WW II, this film makes us remember that people are people everywhere. Ordinary life goes on, even the ""party"" allows this. In spite of living conditions that are less than desireable, the inter-action between the couple is superb as they go from lust to Love. Even when he is in prison, she visits him dressed in her best dress. Far from complaining about his situation, he slowly lifts her dress to admire her black lace slip, and she leads him to make Love to her. They are interupted but it does not matter. Not an easily understandable film if you are not versed in Eastern European life under communisim. It gives a look into another [now long gone] world. The ending is not what you expect but plausible!",1026864000,2,755,4.518248175182482
