8292385,5,B001D8V1D8,I can't say how much I love this series of instructional tapes.  I worry that he may have exposed some of his game since he is still a UFC fighter but what a great set of directions he gives and covers.  He covers everything from different angles almost as good as being in a BJJ class with him and is a great supplement as things you may not remember from class he definitely goes over in detail and covers.  Has become one of my favorite sets of bjj instructionals.,1500595200,,467,4.224719101123595

8292390,5,B001D8V1D8,Really worth buying the whole DVD set! Really improved my fight skills! Demian Maia is indeed the best Jiu-Jitsu fighter there is!,1394582400,,130,4.954545454545454
8292391,5,B001D8V1D8,"As I wrote about the Science of Jiu-Jitsu 2 set I also purchased,this is a key set to buy if you want to learn the Concepts of BJJ from one of the Masters",1369958400,4,154,3.696969696969697
8292392,5,B001D8V1D8,"Because of my job and my hectic schedule I can't get to class as often as I'd like and so I'm still a lowly white belt :-(

This is why I decided to invest in these videos.. and of course because of how great everyone says Damian Maia is and I heard Joe Rogan saying how Damian Maia has the best jiu jitsu in all of MMA.

Anyway for the last few months, on my down time, I've been watching these videos and learning so damn much.  So many of the UFC guys are trying to cash in by making instructional videos and most are disappointing.  But The Science of Jiu Jitsu vids are the real deal and I couldn't be more happy with my purchase.

Just last class I used a really sneaky technique Maia teaches to get a kimura from half guard and I've tapped a few blue belts with it in my class already.  And my guard has gotten very dangerous.. It's gotten to the point where my instructor asked me if I've been training somewhere else on the side, lol.

Anyway if you make any investment in any jiu jitsu instructional product this is the one to get by far.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  Pick up a copy you can always return it if you think I'm wrong.",1284508800,14,1146,4.035398230088496
8292393,5,B001D8V1D8,"Recently began training in Koryu Uchinadi dojo under Sensei Pat McCarthy. Despite patient and obviously world-class instruction,i am a slow learner and there is only so much time a teacher can spend with any one student, so the groundwork (newaza)has really caused me grief...Maia's DVDset is a HUGE help...compulsory. The really impressive thing is that he speaks to entry level beginners and advanced rollers at the same time. Do yourself a favor...by this one!",1264032000,8,463,5.27027027027027
