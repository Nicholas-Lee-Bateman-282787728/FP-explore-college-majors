2550247,5,B000F3NJX2,"It really was a great documentary. It was entertaining, informative and made me want to go swim in the ocean with dolphins, and I don't go in the ocean. This film made me want to overcome that fear. It's just an amazing film that shows you how dolphins are truly so similar to humans and are able to create bonds just like we can. Dolphin lovers will adore it.",1300060800,2,360,4.231884057971015
2550248,5,B000F3NJX2,"I amazingly found this quality documentary for a dollar at a local stationary and party supply store. I have always been entranced by the beauty and intelligence of these majestic sea mammals that we share this planet with. I found this well produced DVD to be very interesting in narrative and video content (excellent undersea footage).  There are many interesting facts and behavioral patterns that Dolphins exhibit, and many of these were covered in this DVD. Their communication patterns and language, intelligent behavior, and ability to defend themselves were some of the interesting areas covered in this marvelous DVD.  The research and actual footage were shot in The Bahamas as well.  If you admire Dolphins, this is an excellent, very well produced, professional DVD for your collection.",1289606400,6,799,5.275590551181103

2550251,3,B000F3NJX2,"Hi,
this DVD is nice to watch once but I defenetly regret buying it because I won't watch it again. My daughter kept losing interest and could't stay focused. The movie is a little boring. Hope my kids turn into huge dolphin fans so we get a little use out of it.",1251417600,2,263,4.076923076923077
2550252,5,B000F3NJX2,Absolutely stunning. This is the best underwater footage I've ever seen of dolphins. You will watch it over and over. It reminds me that I don't spend enough time in the ocean. Hardy Jones and Julia Whitty deserve our gratitude and credit for making this film. What a life - interacting with these amazing beings. Beautiful.,1192492800,3,324,4.803571428571429

I adore the amount of information shared in this video because it gives so much more than a typical documentary about dolphins!  I had to get this one because I wore out the last dvd of this that I owned!",1495497600,,345,4.444444444444445

8116855,5,B000F3NJX2,My son absolutely adores this movie!  Chris has autism & is fascinated by dolphins.  We discovered this gem when he was hospitalized for a 5-day EEG.  It is not easy to entertain an 11 year old boy who is confined to bed with electrodes on his head.  I found this DVD in the hospital movie library.  Chris was absolutely fascinated from the first moments!  It kept him calm & distracted during a very stressful stay in the hospital.  I immediately ordered our own copy when we arrived back home.  Incredibly soothing & contains lots of fascinating information.,1415923200,,560,4.701030927835052
