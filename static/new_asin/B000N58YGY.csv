It's an informative series covering the history and origin of the varied accents and dialects of English as spoken in America. Episode titles include, ""Up North"", ""Down South"" and ""Out West"". Both series, ""The Story of English"" and ""Do You Speak American"", are must-haves for any documentary library.",1402099200,,436,5.154929577464789
8174943,3,B000N58YGY,"As a fan of the ""Story of English"" series from twenty years ago, I was expecting an equally scholarly work. This series was disappointing. An overview of American English is such a great topic; we are a land of such interesting dialects. Unfortunately, the series only touches lightly on certain regional dialects and then goes into depth on topics that really are not linguistically relevant. In the chapter called ""Down South"", for instance, there are brief segments on Appalachian dialect and Cajun English with a lengthy segment on Texas that focuses on  a piece on the border patrol including a bust of illegal immigrants.

The ""Up North"" chapter starts in Maine and only comments on a single word in the Maine dialect before moving further into New England. There is a nod to Boston with a line about ""pahking the cah"", before quickly slipping into New York City. There is some interesting exploration of Black English, predominantly in the Detroit area, but the program moves too quickly from place to place.

""Out West"" is filmed almost entirely in Southern California with a fun segment on Valley Girl and Surfer Dude English, but again there is a lengthy portion spent at Stanford with a quick stop in Seattle that focuses on computer generated speech. That part is marginally interesting, but is already quite dated.

All three chapters include some very interesting discussions with linguists who specialize on the different regions, but rather than revisit some of the aspects of language development that were explored in ""The Story of English"", MacNeil repeatedly plays those old videos and has the modern linguists add commentary.

I purchased the series to use in high school English classes to generate some interest in the development and study of language. My students were fascinated by the topic of linguistics, a field of study they had never really heard of before, but were highly critical of the series as a whole, mainly for the reasons I touched on above. We all agreed that the topic was far too broad to be covered in only three hours.

With school budgets being so strained these days I was further disappointed to find, that after spending about $200 for the series (which I considered a bargain since I had seen it in a film catalog for twice that price) that at the end of the film the viewer is invited to purchase the series from PBS for about 1/3 of the price I paid.",1273622400,10,2404,4.808716707021792

Then I started watching the show and instantly got hooked on this really interesting program.  Being from California ""Like, whatever!"" and having friends and family from Texas, Alabama, and Ohio, it was fascinating hearing all the dialects.  It's too bad that it is extremely expensive to buy now.",1253750400,,393,4.924242424242424

By

James Zaworski

Robert MacNeil, distinguished journalist of ""The MacNeil/Lehrer Report"", put together a fantastic book and documentary television series in the 1980s called ""The Story of English"", which was a look at both the history of the English language as well as the current state of the English language in a global sense at that time.  In both the book, and the ten part series, the premise was that English was well on the way to becoming the ""lingua franca"" of the world.  English was already the international language of business, that English already the dominant language of computers, air traffic controllers, and was spoken as the primary and secondary language to at least two billion people globally, from India to China, Indonesia to Estonia, Poland to the USA.  That English has changed from its humble beginnings is a given.  That English is continuing to change, is also apparent with the different varieties of English.  The varieties of English examined were Cockney and BBC (so called ""public school English""), Black English, Creoles and Pidgins, Indian English, and finally ""American English"".

""Do You Speak American?"" picks up from where the last celebrated documentary series and book left off, and examines the many varieties of American English.  Specifically, Robert MacNeil will examine the major linguistic areas and dominant influences on American English today. He examines some controversies about the role of Spanglish (Spanish English), Chicano English, African American English, Midwest English, ""Southern"" and Texas English, Southwest English, and finally California English (with its Hollywood/TV, as well as so called ""Valley Girl"" and ""Surfer Dude English""), and which ones have an expanding or contracting, and make some predictions about the future of American English.

Robert MacNeil, originally from Nova Scotia, is a transplanted American.  He came to the United States as a university student, and was very confident in his own ability to speak excellent English, or so he thought.  He recalls that during a drama class in an old barn-theater in New England, he was told by the teacher that he needed to change the way he spoke English, that he needed to learn to speak ""standard American English"".  He had to change the way he spoke.

Episode One.

The program begins geographically in that New England barn theater, and moves geographically from the major geographical-linguistic divisions that linguists have distinguished for American English.  We visit Maine, and some lobster fishermen, whose avoidance of the pronounced ""r"" is evident.  As ""standard"", or ""mainstream"" English infiltrates, this linguistic accent may be dying out, as young people are leaving the area for the big cities, such as Boston and New York, where we head next.
New York City is the great experiment, the great melting pot, for America.  It has been the main port of entry from immigrants from all over the world.  The great waves of immigration came from Ireland, Germany, Poland, Italy, China, etc., with each arriving group not speaking any English.  The pattern has always been the same that the non-English speaker immigrants had a difficult time learning English, or sometimes rarely learned to speak it at all.  However, their children ended up learning English with great ease, and they would use their parent language only at home, if they used it at all.  By the next generation, their grandchildren only spoke American English.

It is in New York City that we see and realize that there is no one ""Standard American English"", and that this is a term to be replaced by ""mainstream American"", which is favored by broadcast radio and television news.

We move west by train.  On the train, MacNeil is talking with a linguist, who goes from person to person on the train with a blank map of the United States.  He gives the passengers the same task: he asks them to draw circles around the areas of the USA where the spoken English is ""not standard"", or ""not correct"".  Without exception, circles are drawn around the American South and New York City, and New England.  This is done even by Southerners on the train.  The next task is to have the passenger draw a circle around the area or areas of the country where the American English is ""correct"", and that circle is by and large drawn around the Midwest region.  We stop in Pittsburgh and find that despite the regional nuances of Pittsburgh English, that many features of Midwest English begin here as we move west.
In Detroit, we follow yet another linguist, who emphasizes that despite these major regional divisions, there is variety, and that you are essentially judged in this country by how you speak is a reflection in part on your ethnic background, but also by your perceived socio-economic status.  To emphasize his point, the linguist calls apartment for rent ads and uses different accents, such as African-American, Hispanic, and ""neutral"" English (mainstream).

Episode Two.

Episode two of `Do You Speak American' examines the South, and its surprising variety and influence on mainstream English in America.  In this episode, we are continually accompanied by linguists who offer their expertise so that the layman, such as MacNeil, can understand the nuances and variations in this geographical-linguistic region.  We start in Appalachia, and MacNeil shows the linguist some of the documentary film from ""The Story of English"", where a husband and wife, both story tellers, spin their tall tales with creative and colorful English.  The linguist goes on to talk about how very few people still speak in this particular dialect, and that it soon may be overwhelmed by other southern dialects of English.  However, we go down yonder to Kentucky, and MacNeil and crew interview an elderly gentleman, who can play the fiddle better than the devil himself, and he has much of the `hill speech', much as the late story teller from West Virginia.

We move on to a truck driver, and MacNeil rides along with him in his big rig, and points out that when he speaks on the CB radio, that he speaks ""really Southern"".  The truck driver says he didn't notice this change at tall.  He brings MacNeil to a town in Missouri, where his brother plays good old country music, and we move on to see how this medium has influenced mainstream American English, and made southern speech more accepted, and acceptable, to mainstream America.

From here, we move on to Texas.

Episode 3.

From Texas and the Southwest, we move on to California.  California is another major influence on American English.  We examine Chicano English, and find that it is a true dialect of American English.
In addition to this, we examine the role of TV and Hollywood on American English, and check out the influence of the language from the movie ""Clueless"", the ""Valley Girl"" speech that began over twenty years ago.  From ""Valley Girl"" to ""Surfer Dude"",  skateboarding and snowboarding slang, California remains a dominant influence on American English.

Episode 3 also looks at the role of computers and voice recognition software and its potential future role in American English.

All in all, Do you Speak American, is a great documentary program on the state of American English in 2005.  It will make a fine addition to your documentary library.",1251417600,5,7392,5.037006578947368
8174946,5,B000N58YGY,"After Robert MacNeil stepped away from the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour, he began to research and travel extensively in preparation for this documentary, that finally aired on PBS, a couple of years before.  What is so great about this series is that MacNeil really taps into the vernacular, the common speech patterns, slang and communication habits of people from the East Coast, to the South, and back to the West Coast.

MacNeil interviews everyone from young teenage boys, in the East Coast, who emulate what they hear in rap/hip hop music (down to the ""dawg""), to experts in the study of speech patterns (this includes a man who studied the use of the infamous ""F""-word, as well as a speech expert on the West coast, who has mastered the intricate lingo of Valley Girl talk), people for whom English is not their first language (example being the surge of Latino immigrants in the United States, who settle in neighborhoods-such as in NYC-where they never need to use English, and communicate with other Spanish-speaking people, who are their primary customer base).

MacNeil is sensitive to his subjects, takes a sincere and warm interest in learning more about the roots of American dialects, and shows us, his viewers, the vast range of accents, dialects, speech patterns and methods of communication used throughout the United States.  You will definitely learn something from this film, and it might even help you with cultural sensitivity and understanding, when communicating with people from diverse cultural/social/regional backgrounds in life and business.",1168732800,5,1568,5.1857707509881426
