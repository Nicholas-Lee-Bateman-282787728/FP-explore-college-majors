8432820,2,B004KDYR6G,"Code Red is known for releasing some great (and not so great) titles, but they pick some really obscure stuff, and that's what's important.  Marcy is not one of Joe Sarno's better titles, and Code Red's print is rough, but watchable, if you can get past the color fluctuation and continual print damage.  There's a decent amount of nudity, but almost looks like a cut version of the film, as simulated sex scenes just seem to cut to the next scene without warrant.  If you're a big Sarno fan, it's worth a watch, otherwise spend your time and money more wisely.",1315958400,4,561,4.534653465346534
