8566908,5,B00BDZV8HA,"Comedy Suspense!  The Love Boat Meets Terrorism.  I saw this when it was first aired when I was a teenager.  I mainly watched it because I was a Stella Stevens fan.  There IS genuine suspense but the dialogue and acting are awful to the point of being hilarious.  The most fun is Telly Savalas.  In the first part, every time he gets angry he nearly faints and has to take a heart pill.  He gets over it by the beginning of part two.  I love it that Shelley Winters and Stella Stevens of The Poseidon Adventure were reunited for another boat ride.  Even by 1979 television standards, the special effects are the worst, as if a child had did them. I've never seen more delightful has-beens packed into six hours!  DEFINITELY WORTH THE PRICE!",1444953600,,740,4.455223880597015

8566910,4,B00BDZV8HA,"Several made for television Irwin Allen disaster pictures are no where near as interesting , amusing , entertaining or adult in theme's as  this sprawling French/American co-production . Many of the mature stars featured herein enjoy good , juicy roles and fun characterizations . I'd never seen James Coco , for example , play an essentially dramatic role (with a dollop of humor) . Donald Pleasence plays a wily , witty , urbane version of himself . Telly Savalas is a riot , and quite good , as a cult leader/ship hostage taker or questionable health . Chad Everett is an excellent he man type and so on .
Of coarse much plentiful ridiculous and preposterous stuff occurs . That's more than half the fun . Fairly smart script for the material at hand though .",1409097600,,762,4.602941176470588
8566911,2,B00BDZV8HA,"I was on a good run watching a bunch  of movies...until this dreck! This thing was made in 1979 and given the cast should have been pretty good but instead it is a bunch of Hollywood actors getting together and acting badly, very badly. The biggest offender is Telly Savales, dear God but he was terrible. The idea of who is a follower of his and wants to sink the ship gets old so fast. Me I would have said just sink it with all aboard and you would have spared me seeing this.",1405814400,,479,4.095744680851064
8566912,3,B00BDZV8HA,"Watching the 1979 TV miniseries ""The French Atlantic Affair"" on DVD is like rummaging through a time capsule from that era. For those who have forgotten or are too young to remember a time before DVRs, VCRs, and hundreds of TV viewing options, the show provides an interesting reminder of what was considered event programming back then.

At a time when there were only three television networks, they would regularly trot out star-studded miniseries like ""French Atlantic"" during sweeps months in the hopes of hooking viewers into an ongoing storyline over several nights. ""French Atlantic,"" based on a thriller by ""North by Northwest"" author Ernest Lehman, has an intriguing plot. A group of criminals led by religious cult leader Telly Savalas take over a transatlantic ocean liner and threaten to blow the ship up unless they receive a huge ransom. The hijackers work so swiftly and smoothly that the passengers are unaware anything is wrong. The crew, led by Captain Louis Jourdan, knows what's up, but they have no idea just which of the passengers are actually the hijackers.

The miniseries boasts an impressive cast for television, mixing big name film actors whose star power had diminished somewhat, like Jourdan, Jose Ferrer, and Shelley Winters, with a number of familiar TV stars, including Savalas, Chad Everett, and Richard Jordan. Everett is the hero, a writer who had previously reported favorably on Savalas and whom Savalas now wants to serve as his Bosworth, recording the events for posterity. Everett plays along in hopes of finding a way to rescue the passengers. Everett actually has an ace in the hole of sorts; he is traveling with his ten-year-old son, a ham radio buff, who is able to communicate the ship's predicament back to the United States and eventually to the attention of the authorities.

For a big (for TV) budget suspense film, there's relatively little action in ""French Atlantic."" There are a couple of fist fights and some rather cheesy explosive effects, but the overall action level over six hours is about on a par with what audiences were used to seeing on the one-hour cop shows of the era. There's also some father-and-son bonding between Everett and his estranged son and an obligatory romance with cruise director Michelle Phillips (who has a wicked savate kick). However, the miniseries works far better as a puzzle than as a romance or an action movie. As the series unfolds, the audience, along with some of the characters, begin raising questions: How do they expect to get away with hundreds of pounds of gold bullion? How do Savalas and company expect to get off a cruise ship in the middle of the ocean? And, most importantly for the good guys, how can they figure out which of the passengers are really bad guys? The show eventually provides fairly satisfying answers to all the questions the script raises.

The miniseries definitely has its share of flaws. Savalas is enjoyably loopy, but the rest of the bad guys are a fairly bland bunch, with network censorship constraints toning down the degree of violence they dish out during the course of the voyage, to the extent that some of the hijackers seem absolutely apologetic. As a result, for most of the series, there is almost no sense of menace or danger, and watching the show at times feels like watching a very long episode of ""Murder She Wrote."" Even worse, the miniseries is badly bloated. Lehman's novel would have made a good two-hour movie, but making it nearly three times that long requires massive script padding, with one scene after another having characters prattle on without coming to the point, The result is a show, that like a cruise ship, lumbers along instead of building suspense swiftly.

Actually, what makes ""French Atlantic"" entertaining for audiences watching on DVD in 2014 is seeing the at times hilarious differences in style and technology between now and 35 years ago. First and foremost is the notion that a ship could be held incommunicado except for two children exchanging ham radio messages. The leisure suits and mod haircuts of the era are also good for a few laughs.

The biggest chuckles are likely to come from the way computers are used in the miniseries. One of the bad guys is a computer whiz who takes great pride in the fact that he gained access to a computer that allowed him to plan the entire robbery. He is easily outdone though by John Houseman, who runs a think tank that contains a five-story tall computer system that in only a couple of days allows him to compile sufficient information on all the passengers to make some rather good guesses about what's actually going on. It's probably a good thing Houseman isn't around to see Penelope on ""Criminal Minds"" do pretty much the same thing in about two minutes.

While ""The French Atlantic Affair"" probably provided sufficient thrills and suspense to keep 1979 TV audiences enthralled for a few evenings, its slow, sedate pace and restrained tone would not resonate well with today's audiences. I vaguely remembered seeing the series when it originally aired and was immediately struck by how badly it had aged. Still, I'm giving it a marginally favorable (2.5 stars rounded up to 3) rating, largely on the basis of the unintentional amount of highly enjoyable camp in the miniseries. Large parts of this miniseries play as if Dr. Evil had been on the cruise ship planning out the robbery. ""The French Atlantic Affair"" doesn't play in the way it originally intended, but it does offer an at times highly amusing look back at the way we (and network television) were 35 years ago.",1403222400,,5601,4.870933892969569

8566914,5,B00BDZV8HA,"This mini-series kept me on the edge of my seat, deep into the night, way beyond my usual bedtime.

I was really impressed with the acting of James Coco, but it left me wondering why Chad Everett never made it to super stardom.

If someone needs to forget his current real life problems, The French Atlantic affair is the way to do it.

It is a much more wholesome escape than illicit sex, drugs and alcohol.",1391040000,,408,4.342105263157895
