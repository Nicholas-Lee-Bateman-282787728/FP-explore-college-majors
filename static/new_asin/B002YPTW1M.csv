8384367,5,B002YPTW1M,"I bought the two disc version which includes a CD of the music.  But it is the DVD I use on my computer.  The photography is really nice.  It is all various winter scenes in the woods.  Looks like most of it was filmed in Colorado, or somewhere near the rockies.  Since it is all winter scenes, it sometimes feels like it is in black and white, but in the scenes with mountains or pine trees, the colors come though well.  There is mostly scenery of streams, forests, and mountains with very little wildlife.  The images are not just still pictures, but the camera pans the scenery, which sometimes feels as though you are seeing the scenery as from a car driving through the woods.  If there is motion in the scene, like a stream or waterfall, the camera often slowly zooms in or out, so the video does not have a static feel to it like a still photo with no motion. The great feature of this DVD is that there are two soundtracks to choose from, instrumental Christmas music done in a soft ambient style, and soft ambient music suitable for relaxation.  The Christmas music was much more pleasant that I thought it would be, but I usually play the soft ambient soundtrack, which I think is beautiful. The video will start over again so you can leave it on for continuous play.  I like photography of the woods, especially in the fall or winter and I love soft ambient music, so I am very pleased with this.  Highly recommended.  I would love for this company to produce a similar video with a fall theme.",1325376000,6,1506,4.397111913357401
