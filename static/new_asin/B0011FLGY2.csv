3064555,4,B0011FLGY2,"This ""A Haunting"" dvd was compiled of episodes that are in seasons 1-2, I ordered it because I've enjoyed all of the ""A Haunting"" dvds to present, but was disappointed to order this one and had already seen it, the same goes for the ""A Haunting""-The House, it had mostly duplicate episodes.  So if you purchase any of the mentioned above I would recommend purchasing the complete seasons.",1226188800,22,388,4.705882352941177

8241639,5,B0011FLGY2,"I  love this series and they are told ont in a cheesy way. But they keep you on the same biscuit in your hand for about 20 minutes before you get to eat it!!!
The stories are great everyone who loves ghost stories should have all the seasons. It's such a shame that they stopped this series, but you can get  ""A Haunting, season 6 by pre ordering it from Amazon. I look forward to these dvd's!",1403568000,,393,4.090909090909091
8241640,3,B0011FLGY2,not the best but I have seen worse I like watching it with a group of buddies on a Friday night,1378252800,,95,3.5714285714285716
8241641,4,B0011FLGY2,I watched this on TV years ago and decided it was worth seeing again. Well ... I liked it (first episode) even better this time around! The actors were likable and plot kept me on the edge of my seat. I had more fun watching this than 95% of the Netflix movies I've seen. Subtracted 1 star because the second episode (Demon Child) was poorly acted and not scary. Horror and thriller fans should definitely check this out!!!,1354752000,,423,4.435897435897436
8241642,4,B0011FLGY2,"This set of DVD is entertaining and spine-chilling in some scenes but it's a waste of money. Why? It's because it shows only 4 episodes out 38 original ones.

It's too bad I did not know this before buying this set. I've ordered the whole series called ""A haunting"". It consists of 9 DVDs and it costs only thirty dollars!",1263600000,2,322,4.366666666666666
8241643,4,B0011FLGY2,"I love this Discovery Series and as usual the stories gave me goose bumbs all over and a couple of times freaked me out a little.
AWESOME!",1237075200,2,138,4.148148148148148
