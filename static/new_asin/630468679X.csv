7875694,4,630468679X,"This is the prequel to the Shadow Skill movie, but the introduction actually starts off about six years after the Shadow Skill movie. So, to watch the series in order, skip the introduction, watch the OAVs, watch the movie, then watch the OAV introduction. Now that that's cleared up, on to the review.
I really loved the opening to the OAVs. The animation and music are both high caliber, and this is certainly one of the best openings I've seen. The art itself has been criticized quite a bit, and I do agree that the contour on some of the characters is really thick, but I rather enjoy its unique style. How can you not like the design for Scarface?
The sound and music are excellent. For me, buying the soundtrack certainly isn't out of the question, either. As for the storyline, it basically follows Gau and Elle as they wander about, gaining more members to their party and fighting the daily bad guy.  While the Shadow Skill movie had an average story but great action sequences, the OVAs have average action sequences but a great story. Most of the battles involve the characters caught in a death trap, when they suddenly summon all of their inner energy and win the battle with a single powerful attack. That can be disappointing. It also turned out that each episode was less interesting than the previous one. At one point in the OAVs, the subtitles flash onto the screen and disappear right away, so you'd have to pause the frame in order to read what Elle is saying. Still, this is a great series. Recommended to martial arts fans.",992995200,,1547,4.584837545126354
7875695,5,630468679X,"This is a really good anime movie, but unfortunetly not vey known. I saw an ad for the movie and decided to give it a try, and you can be sure I don't regret it! It's a sort of mixed RPG and fighting. The movie is about  a girl named Ella; the Shadow Skill, her brothe; Gau, her friend; Faury and  a little girl named Kiow that they meet in the beginning of the movie's  adventure. Although not totally nessesary, you don't need to see Shadow  Skill vol. 1 to understand this movie. So what are you waiting for? Add it  to your cart",961459200,2,532,4.076923076923077
