877317,4,6304401892,"The 1950's were a movie theater-goers dream come true, particularly if you were a kid and loved sci-fi. It seemed like every Saturday in the summer we were off to the matinee with our silver quarters to see the likes of  ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", or ""Them!"", or  ""The War of the Worlds"", or this low budget marvel,  ""Invaders from Mars.""
By now, almost everyone knows about it  and its cold war innuendo. But as kids, we didn't know and couldn't have  cared less. All we knew was ""Invaders from Mars"" was scary and  memorable, particularly the last sequence with the flash-backs and the  Martians' bizarre surgical procedures which turned lovable citizens into  obedient, nefarious saboteurs (anyone for a commie takeover)? And who could  forget the tentacled, silver-painted, cold blooded Martian leader in the  glass dome? (""He is mankind developed to it's ultimate  potential""). Instant nightmare material.
The picture quality isn't  anything to rave about, even on the current DVD. There are plenty of  celluloid carry-over scratches here and there and some segments,  particularly during the last third of the film where they're in the dark a  lot, seem a little washed-out. What's most irritating to me, however, is  that the section in the observatory where Arthur Franz and Jimmy Hunt are  reviewing models of various types of space craft which could be visiting  Earth, has been omitted. Most people probably won't miss it  though.
Nevertheless, ""Invaders from Mars"" is still  quintessential sci-fi of a bygone era. It is testimony to just how a fast  pace, good story and keen directing (William Cameron Menzies) can  overshadow a modest budget. It is every bit worth the price of admission!",955843200,12,1709,5.050179211469534
877318,2,6304401892,"well this seems to be one of the first bodysnatcher type movies, so it has its originality. the paranoia and fear of the kid when no one will listen is relatable too. for those points i gave it a 2. however the ending makes  no sense, and i particularly don't like it when a movie ends with someone  waking up, because either way it wasn't real to me anyway. the remake of  this was awful. i wouldn't dare call this scary though, however, it has its  originality in that it was one the very first and has since been copied in  hundreds of ways. I wouldn't recommend it though.",952214400,,576,4.247706422018348
877319,4,6304401892,"Invaders from Mars is presented from the point of view of little Jimmy Hunt, but this is no childrens' movie.  Although more than 40 years old, many of the more frightening sequences are probably still too intense for  youngsters.  Almost every childhood terror is employed in this picture;  seemingly solid ground suddenly opens to swallow an unsuspecting victim;  there are plenty of long, dark tunnels with who knows what around the  corner; odd, frightening sounds abound; and huge, silent, not-quite-human  creatures appear and disappear.
The effects are a bit dated but serve  their purpose. The plot is simplistic, but therein lies the secret of its  effectiveness. The Martian invaders employ the process of capturing,  electronically altering, and then releasing members of a small town's  population to accomplish their never fully revealed purpose.  From the  perspective of our hero, young Jimmy, this creates the terrifying problem  of associating with people who look like themselves but don't act like  themselves, including his own parents.
For once in our lifetime, the law  enforcement and military people in this picture don't take forever  to act,  realizing that immediate and decisive intervention is called for and seeing  that it happens.
After Jimmy and his loved-ones are finally rescued from  their mortal peril, the writers throw in one final, disturbing plot twist  that gives Invaders From Mars a devastatingly effecting ending.
Yes, this  is an early effort at Science Fiction.  Fans of modern film-making will  find many of the costumes and special effects almost laughable.  However,  none of this detracts from the fact that the story works.  This is one  sleeper that just might interrupt yours.",944697600,7,1730,5.307407407407408
877320,4,6304401892,"This is the original...a remake was made in the 80's but it lacks the frightening aspect of this one. It could happen!  The scene in the tunnel to the invaders' spaceship is unbelievable...to this day it still amazes  me. Having been made in the 50's, it has a certain naivete'.

877321,2,6304401892,"I saw it in 1955 and the current version is a joke by comparison. Part of my reaction is due to my age, I'm sure, but I had the same experience as another reviewer--oversold it to my kids on the basis of my recollection.  By any standard though, most of the characters were flat.  The director  must have blown too much of the budget on special effects.",920073600,,353,4.2388059701492535
877322,3,6304401892,"I first saw this movie at the theater as a very young and impressionable lad. It's filmed at ""kid level"" quite literally - the camera doesn't get above waist-level for most of the flick.  There are some disturbing scenes, especially one near the beginning where  the young boy's father, recently ""taken over"" by the Martians,  slaps the boy off of his chair, and THAT, I think, is what made the movie  scary to us back then: the idea that people we trusted could, overnight, be  turned into someone who could (and WOULD) hurt us.
Looking at it now, it  is surprisingly full of stock footage. The ""Martian"" costumes are  hopeless - the zippers are almost *prominently* featured. And yet....and  yet....when the sands start to shift around the entrance of the Martian  ship's landing spot, and the wordless choir starts in, I still got a small  frisson reminding me of those long-ago days in that dark theater.

No one has ever done a better job of depicting a kid's nightmares. Every single thing about it -- the brilliantly weird sets, the stiff acting, the odd camera angles, the bizarre color schemes, the goony yet undeniably scary aliens, the notion that to a kid *all* adults can be aliens -- keeps you off-kilter from start to finish. It truly is one of the stranger movies ever made, and its bleak ending, canceling all hope of redemption, took some kind of dark genius.",1510790400,2,583,4.457943925233645

877435,5,6304401892,"Be sure to notice all the standard Sci-fi actors and even the Beaver's mother ""Kelston's Secretary"" (Barbara Billingsley).

This movie was well done with just the right amount of spookiness and has a kid's perspective on what is happening. This is not a kid is smarter than his/her parents movie. There are lots of strange happenings and lots of tension. I will not go into the details as if you have not seen the movie it is more fun to be surprised.

Right from the beginning Little David MacLean sees a flying saucer land in the sandpit behind the house. He tells his parents. They being good parents check it out for him and naturally find nothing out of the ordinary. Maybe he had a nightmare or maybe the nightmare is just beginning as everyone starts acting strange and only David can sound the alarm.

877478,5,6304401892,"Like so many others, this movie scared the daylights out of me as a kid.  At night, I used to pray to God to protect Earth from alien invaders, that's how much this movie got to me.  You might think that was just childhood innocence, but looking at it a half century later, there's some good movie-making here.  Just the sight of that path up the hill is terrifying.  And the concept of the aliens -- OMG, that head!  That drill!  The giant mutants with the lava bazooka.  And the sand, omg, the sand.  This isn't just some schlocky nostalgia trip, it's a genuine sci-fi classic.  When just the image of a wooden fence triggers a 50 year old sense memory of terror, you know this is a work of rare cinematic skill.

As late as 1922, scientists such as J. Arthur Thomson were seriously speculating about life on Mars more advanced than humans.  This was after the invention of the spectroscope; scientists had already decoded the chemical makeup of the sun.  So only 30 years later, the story -- in particular, the astronomer and military taking David seriously -- was not as corny as it might seem today.",1505174400,4,1104,4.492462311557789
877479,4,6304401892,"I love these old campy sci-fi flicks. They remind me of my childhood when my mother would give us each a quarter and we would tramp on down to the theater to watch the matinee. We lived and breathed this stuff. Don't judge these by today's standards but by the times when they first came out. Space was new and mysterious and anything was possible. For youngsters back then, space invaders was believable. Yes, we are naive by today's standards but back then, it was all we knew.",1504656000,2,479,4.454545454545454
877480,5,6304401892,"An idealistic, unreasonably happy family are awoken at 4:00 AM by a storm and a flying saucer that lands in their backyard.  Their boy insists he saw it park out back.  Dad scoffs but makes the bad decision of investigating the claim.  He shows up at breakfast angry, different.  He slaps his son to the floor.  The rest of the nightmare involves this poor boy and his desperation attempt to find someone who will believe him.  He has to stay one step ahead of people with wounds on the back of their neck.  They are not quite what they seem.

Fabulous.  Creepy.  I especially love the police station set with its impossibly high walls and lack of furnishings.  The cell sequence is also an impressive use of light and shadow, multiplying the bars beyond reckoning.

He goes into the space ship below ground finally with the ground opening up and sending him and a female doctor into pit below, with the mutants. Then he sees them start the drill to go into her head, to implant a piece to control her,just  like they did to his dad, mom, two cops, General Mayberry, and the police chief and others. Great fun. Morris Ankrum is suppurb as the commanding officer. They use a ray gun to open up passages or seal up the tunnels. David, with help holding the gun, opens up the sealed tunnel,so that they can climb up the ladder and escape as the time bomb is about to go off. It is all a dream.

When we finally get below, there are a lot of guys in baggy suits running here and there; too much of it for me. The brains behind the invasion is a head with a big brain inside a glass globe. All he does is move his eyes to his right and left for no apparent reason. Not very convincing.

877591,4,6304401892,"Back when I was in kindergarten, I stayed up one evening to watch CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND with my parents on HBO. There are a lot of images in that movie that stand out and are memorable, but the one that stands out the most to me is the one where little Barry is running down the road up a hill past a white fence looking for lights. It wasn't until years later that I discovered this scene (as well as a few others) was inspired by INVADERS FROM MARS. Not only did it influence CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, but INVADERS FROM MARS influenced countless other sci-fi movies from INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHER to INDEPENDENCE DAY. I tried to find the movie at local video stores, but no one carried it. It wasn't until this 50th Anniversary Special Edition DVD was released that I was able to obtain a copy and view the movie for the first time.

The plot of the movie is fairly simple. Young David Maclean (Jimmy Hunt) sees a U.F.O. land in a sandpit over a hill by his house. He tells his parents and his dad goes to investigate. When he comes back home he is a completely different person. Other people David sees walking over the hill change, too. David notices markings on the backs of people's necks and it doesn't take David long to figure out there are aliens somewhere over the hill and they are taking over human bodies. David seeks out help from a woman doctor and a male astronomer. Together they get assistance from the military, leading to a final showdown in tunnels and the alien space craft underground

When I first watched INVADERS FROM MARS, I was amused by how outdated much of the movie is. The aliens are referred as mutants (the movie's characters pronounce the word ""moo-tants"" instead of ""mute-nts""), most of them appear as people dressed up in green rubber suits, etc. Despite this, the movie still remains a certain amount of charm and has some rather great visual effects. Jimmy Hunt gives a great performance and Leif Erickson as David's father also provides a great turn from being such a loving father to one that is being controlled by aliens. Many of the visuals in the movie still retain much of their original power, from the hill with the broken fence, the swirling sand that swallows people, and the first few moments of seeing the interior of the alien tunnels. Also worth mentioning is the creepy music that still provides chills.

My biggest complaint about the movie is the ending. The final sequence is a cop out, one that has no connection to the movie and seems to have been tacked on at the last minute in an attempt at providing and extra thrill. Without any explanation, the sequence takes away from all the good things that happen in the movie.

The extras on the DVD include both the American original release and the alternative British version of the film, which has the better ending; a color theatrical trailer; a comprehensive still gallery; and an Easter Egg on the Extras menu that provides black and white trailers for several movies including BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA.

INVADERS FROM MARS isn't a great piece of science fiction, but it is an extremely influential one. It's a movie that all film buffs should see and one that serious ones will want to own.",1441324800,8,3243,4.565292096219931

877594,3,6304401892,"I just watched this online today and I thought it was probably as mediocre as the remake with Karen Black. What really takes a toll on the viewer is the annoying music. It is loud at times and a bit overdone. The scene at the end where the boy is running away goes on for two or three minutes, or it seemed to. The boy is reliving the movie, his experiences. I mean, we just saw the movie and now we have to watch highlights before the bomb goes off. And the boy is not really running anywhere but he is running in place. Also, at the end the boy wakes up and realizes that it was all just a nightmare, but then that night he saw a saucer land. Here we go again? The movie is pretty dumb. It tries to be scary and entertaining for entire family. G rated movies are rarely scary. Thus, I was only marginally entertained. I really couldn't recommend this movie in it's first installment or the remake. If you just want to watch it to educate yourself I say why not, just don't expect to be on the edge of your seat. All in all I was bored.

And this is NOT to say that the 50th Anniversary Special Edition isn't great. I merely commented on the movie and NOT this special edition. I'm sure there are probably many special features that will enhance your viewing experience, or one would hope so.",1438905600,2,1293,4.192771084337349
877595,5,6304401892,"I remember this as a kid on the sunday morning movie and when VHS came out nobody ever heard of it! then I finally saw it on VHS at a
flea market goodwill type store brand new for a dollar. I have watched it once a week for years. It's just classic 50's sci fi but I think the best
sci fi movie ever made even with the hokey green martian costumes! It starts off right from the start with boy looking out his window and
sees a flying saucer land in a sand pit and his dad goes out to investigate and comes back with a strange mark on back of his neck and
acting funny then the police come and same thing happens and on and on and the boy keeps trying to tell people what's going on. I love
the way it was filmed and it's very retro 50's style. Now I just read the VHS was recut and military footage added which my version does
have and the DVD doesn't but I don't think this version is ruined by this footage but be warned ordering VHS. I noticed the dVd is very
expensive but most say the quality is better and it comes with a booklet. I like my vhs copy but I may order dvd later. But as far as the
movie again the best sci fi movie of the 50's or ever made and I have almost all of the big sci fi movies made back then. get it now.",1437955200,,1234,3.82421875
877596,5,6304401892,"I was digging around my local used DVD/CD store and was very excited to find a copy of this.  It was in pristine condition with a sticker price of $4.99!  Now, like many of you, I am always checking prices and reviews on things before I buy it using the wonderful Amazon app.  I had only seen still images of this film in books and the little alien in the bubble always looked really cool.  Being a fan of these classic science fiction films, I had always wanted to see this particular one but you could never find a copy of it anywhere.  My concern with buying this was that it would be of poor quality and look like one of those films you get in the 50 pack ""collector"" sets.  Those films look so grainy and they look as if someone put a VHS copy of the movie through an old tube TV and filmed it using a crappy camera pointed at the screen.  A lot of those sets have great movies that I would love to see but the picture quality is unbearable.

I wanted to see if others had complaints about picture quality and was shocked to see how much this DVD was going for online.  I don't think I'd want to pay that much for a copy of this and felt pretty lucky to have this one in my hand for so cheap!  But my happiness was lined with a grey lining of worry as I began to read the reviews concerning picture quality.  They seemed to be mixed and I just figured I'd go for it anyway especially since the asking price was nice.

Well, I am happy to say that this particular version is indeed very watchable and nothing like the quality of those terrible 50 pack ""collector"" sets.  I put the disc in my DVD up converter and watched it on a 50 inch Samsung 720p plasma (yeah...old TV but it still has an outstanding picture).  You can definitely see grain and artifacts from the film's age but it certainly did not hinder the experience.  The most noticeable thing about this version is the thin film lines that appear as the film scrolls.  They appeared like thin green horizontal streaks that would jump in at different areas of the film.  It kind of looks like that ""old movie"" effect that some camcorders have.  Again, this did not detract from my viewing enjoyment.  It sort of gave it a ""classic"" look.  The only real blurry scene that I noticed was the part when the alien controlled mom goes to get her son at the police station.  There are a few moments when some of that gets a little weird to look at but it was only for a few seconds.  The darker scenes and outdoor scenes looked fine to me.  This release was very watchable and I am glad that I went ahead and got it.  The film itself is really outstanding and the final moments with it's increasingly building climax is surprisingly good.  The soundtrack to this film is also very cool.  I wish Intrada records (known for releasing fantastic classic scores) would put this one together for us.  There is also a bit of a mystery ending that is pretty cool too.

A cool surprise with this DVD release is the 8 page colored insert that contains a wealth of information about the film, photos, and a history concerning the original negatives.  Today, the 35mm negatives, color separations and Cinecolor master of this film are stored in cold climate controlled vaults in Kansas.  That is good news because maybe one day they will really give this film the treatment it deserves and restore it properly.  It would be awesome to see this film cleaned up...but I don't think I'd want to see it cleaned up too well.  It might change the way some of the special effects look?  Even in this DVD version, you can see the zippers on the backs of the ""Martian Invader's"" costumes.  Oh...and speaking of those guys in the costumes....man they are huge!  According to the included book, one guy was 8'6"" and the other was 7'7"" (Max Palmer & Lock Martin).

So this review is for you folks who happen to stumble upon it and wonder about the picture quality and I hope you find a good deal like I did.  I enjoyed the movie very much and found the viewing experience to be quite tolerable and nothing like those that you find in the cheap box sets.  The included bonus book was great and there is also a alternate British version of the film that deletes the ""dream part"" and adds additional scenes that lengthen the observatory sequence.  You also get the movie trailer and a still gallery.",1433376000,9,4328,4.349127182044888

877640,5,6304401892,"If you haven't already discovered INVADERS FROM MARS, this is a wonderful 1952 SF film that is sort of a well kept secret.

It's not as well known as it should be, but it's up there with the 1950s' WAR OF THE WORLDS, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, THEM!, etc.
One of the charms of this film is its inspired, surreal cinematography, 'Cabinet Of Dr Caligari' meets Dali meets Harryhausen.
There's a very unique psychological (Freudian) sense of doom here, viewed through a young boy's eyes.

I won't spoil anything here. The film doesn't rely on special effects. It's low budget, in the same way INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS depends on acting and plot concept, not FX. And that's a good thing.

This film has deceptive staying power, and you'll find yourself suddenly (subliminally) thinking about it long after. It's also very re-watchable, with several layers you will want to enjoy over repeat viewings.

I love this film, and it's a pleasure to be able to recommend it. Sit back and enjoy!

PS There's a very uninspired, lackluster 'remake' from 1986, same title, with Karen Black. It's just awful (I reviewed it also), so don't waste your time. This 1952 Original, though is brilliant, so have fun. 5 Stars!

877643,5,6304401892,"First, if you are going to try and compare this classic circa 1953 with current or even 1970's Sci-Fi, you WILL be disappointed!  I saw this at the Saturday kiddie matinee  when it first came out.

It scared the hell out of me. I assumed my scarey movie position on the concrete movie floor behind the backrest of the chair in front of me and occasionally peeked out between the chairs over the armrest.  You learned the scarey music and when it was gone, most of the time it was 'safe' to peek so the  monster wouldn't get you.

I had dreams of the critters and was constantly looking at peoples necks for months.  But I did get over it.

In retrospect, this was and is a fun movie. There are several great B actors in the flick.  Its obviously a low budget film, but its a fun low-budget film. Kids (and adults) today are spoiled with great SFX. I think the most expensive SFX in Invaders from Mars cost a dollar three-ninety-eight.

This is a great movie to get your main squeeze in a grip and pretend its the 50 or 60's and have smooch fun.

877646,4,6304401892,"This review is for the Image Entertainment release, the 50th anniversary edition of ""Invaders From Mars"".  Image Entertainment is a major player in providing high quality video products and another good sign is that this edition is part of the Wade Williams Collection. On the plus side, both the U.S. and British versions of this enjoyable film are included on the single DVD. (The British release contains some additional footage). The trailer and limited scene selection are included, plus engaging menu graphics, and a pretty extensive photo gallery you'll enjoy. Image Entertainment also includes a nifty multipage booklet with  production facts and trivia, focusing on the film's archiving and available transfers. Perhaps this is partly done to justify the lone aesthetic defects here. The sound is great, but I found the picture defects a bit distracting. Some vertical lines off and on, and a few other issues. Since the film is in color, the vertical lines are more distracting because they contrast color-wise with the overall screen image.  Not a deal-breaker for me, and the open-minded may even view this rough edge stuff as enhancing the throwback feel of tbe film. I have to believe that Image Entertainment did their level best picture-wise with what they had to work with. Purists can only hope that  archival cleanup is in this classic film's future. In the meantime, enjoy this edition! Oh, and the cast is great! And; wasn't that Barbara Billingsley in a brief cameo?

877827,4,6304401892,"With an extremely provocative plot, told in a highly effective manner, Invaders From Mars (1953) is a chilling science fiction thriller, where a young boy struggles to prevent alien invaders from taking over the Earth.  The movie is classic old fashioned sci-fi, where strange events begin to occur, after a flying saucer appears to have landed in a sand pit on an isolated farm.  The film is very atmospheric and suspenseful, until the extraterrestrial threat is identified, and the movie becomes an action flick.

Through the window of his house, budding astronomer David MacLean (Jimmy Hunt) observes what looks like a flying saucer landing behind a hill, on the farm where he lives with his parents.  David's father (Leif Ericson) a scientist at a top secret plant, goes to investigate, and then goes missing for a while.  When he returns, his personality has completely changed, becoming extremely aggressive and harsh.  In short order, a couple of policeman and a neighbor, disappear into the sandy ground near where the spacecraft landed, and then reappear acting strangely.

Realizing that something terrible has happened, David tries to get help at the police station, but finds that the Chief of police has also been taken over, and worse yet his own mother (Hillary Brooke), who arrives at the station with his father, to take him home.  Fortunately David has been put under the care of Dr. Pat Burke (Helena Carter) of the health department, who manages to keeps David under her custody.

Consulting with Dr. Stuart Kelston, an astronomer who is friends with David, a theory emerges that the invaders may be synthetic humans created by the Martians, who are planning an attack on the secret plant.  When informed, the military quickly mobilizes and gets involved big time, mounting a major operation, and overrunning the MacLean farm with soldiers.  Things take a turn for the weird, as David and Dr. Burke disappear beneath the ground, and are taken prisoner by the aliens who have constructed a strange system of subterranean caverns.  The army attempts to rescue them, and destroy the invaders, leading up to a climactic and ambiguous ending that plays big time with your head.

With an effective soundtrack, the film also features some good acting for the genre, particularly by young Jimmy Hunt, who had an active career as a child actor, and also appears in the 1986 remake of the film.  With a body snatcher type theme and a kid as the hero, Invaders From Mars immediately grabs your attention.  When the threat is identified, the movie shifts gears and features the kind of fighting common in many alien invasion films.  The characterization of the aliens is a bit of a stereotype, and the special effects are a bit elementary, but still shows some imagination and flair.  This movie is simply a must see for fans of classic alien invasion films.",1328054400,3,2866,4.9375

Back in the very early 60's my parents took me to a drive in- where I saw this movie that scarred me so bad we had to leave because I was crying so badly.
All I remember was this radiation sound and people being burned. I remember a postman going into the backyard of some home and then that radiation sound and the  screams. Then there was a boy or maybe just a dog and they were going into the back yard. By then I was crying so badly we had to leave. Someone told me it might have been the Giant Behemoth. I just saw that movie and though the sound is right and the burns, that scene that terrified me was NOT in this movie. Someone on line said to try Invaders from Mars. I have never seen this movie. Does this have the scene with the dog and the postman going into a backyard and the radiation sound? I appreciate any help to locating this movie as it has remained a mystery to my for 50 years! Does anyone have any other ideas?????",1293494400,,1056,3.981132075471698
877900,5,6304401892,"The first time I seen this film, was back when T.V.'s still only had 3, maybe 4 channels, and the only way you could see movies like these was on a Friday or Saturday night program called ""Shock Theater"".  These programs would show older horror and sci-fi flicks, and almost always had a 'horror host' to introduce the films, and usually make bad and cheesy jokes, in a creepy sort of way, before or after commercial breaks.
  The sets in this 'frightmare' are what make this Invaders from Mars eerie for me, because they are from the viewpoint of a child.  A child who has loving parents, just like I had.  But things start to change, after the boy witnesses a 'flying saucer' land, somewhere behind his home.  The ship goes underground, and the boy tells his kind and patient father about it.  When Dad checks on it, he's swallowed up in the earth.  He returns as a mean, abusive man that the kid is terrified of.  His mother becomes another victim, with the help of the kid's dad.  The one scene, where the kid is in the towering police station trying to get help, his now maritan-controlled mother comes to get him.  When the boy runs to his mother to embrace her, a close-up of her face shows her with a dead expression, with no feeling.  Her eyebrow raises as she looks right into the camera, as if to say; ""I'm one of 'Them', now"", I found disturbing.  A child psychologist is called for by one of the cops, and she tends to believe the kid, seeing that his fear is real.  Plus she's a redhead, and darn-tootin' hot looking.  (sorry, had to throw that in) : )
  Told from a childs' point of view during this time frame, where the Cold War with communism, and the fear of indoctrination into a system of government that had little regard for human life, was very real then, as it should be even today.  And that fear is very well expressed to the viewer.  Just as in another cold war classic; Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the use of odd camera angles and fear of the unknown, is what makes this movie for me.  It bothered me as a child, and is still frightening to this day for small children.  Yes, it does have it's 'cheesy' moments, no doubt.  But they can be overlooked when one just takes the movie for what it is; 50's Science fiction. A bit of trivia:  The balloon looking things hanging from the ceiling of the underground labyrinth the martians made, are actually blown up condoms.  And everything was filmed on a soundstage, except of course the generous amount of stock footage of soldiers and tanks training during World War II, and the car/jeep chase scene.
  Fun to watch!  Highly recommend!  Stay away from the 1980's remake!  It's stupid, and is not even remotely scary in any way!",1284249600,2,2706,4.443089430894309
877901,2,6304401892,"The film starts well, with the quintaessential freckled American boy trying to convince people that he saw a flying saucer land in his backyard and that something went wrong with his father. It is the Body Snatchers kind of atmosphere: people keep getting trapped in a kind of wetsand pit, to return as zombies. So far so good.
  For some reason, a gorgeous female doctor believes the boy, in spite of his claims being highly extraordinary and devoid of any corroboratory evidence. (From here on the movie gets worse and worse).
  She takes the boy to an astronomer, who not only also believes the child on the flimsiest of the arguments, but he argues that since there is no oxygen or warmth on the surface of Mars, Martians (whose existence is therefore taken for granted) must live underground or on spaceships. How the Martians survived before they could develop the spaceships is not elaborated, but when the female doctor --who shows a lot more sense-- claims that the astronomer couldn't believe that garbage, imperturbably he answers ""I'm a scientist"", a reply that should have driven the whole theater in laughter. When, also correctly, it is pointed out to him that he cannot prove such BS, he imperturbably answers that ""it cannot be disproved either"". Apparently believing that his reply is a scientific argument, he states that it also cannot be disproven that Martians developed mutants to save themselves from extintion. What a scientist!
**SPOILER**
This eminent colleague of Galileo, Copernicus, Halley and Sagan then calls the military who, naturally enough, believe the whole story downright (after all, Martians land in our backyard every other day) and proceed to commandeer a huge number of tanks which will spend the remainder of the film coming up and aimlessly shooting at nothing (it seems this is what military guys do for fun). Apparently, the ever wandering and trigger happy tanks cannot be blamed on director Menzies but on some other genious that later ""improved"" the movie with documentary material he found in a bin. Great; it is just what the film needed.
The presence of the Martians is another step down. In this 1953 feature movie the Martians look like movie-serial extraterrestrials (cheap and funny). The head of the Martians is just that -a head which can't do anything but flipping his eyes. Really scary (if you are a toddler, maybe).
**WORSE SPOILER YET!!!**
The final insult to the viewers comes when we learn that the whole thing was a boy's dream and that nothing at all happened to his parents. And, as if this were not offensive enough, when the boy goes back to bed he, apparently now for real, witnesses (guess what?) the landing of a spaceship on his backyard.

877964,4,6304401892,"Back when I was in kindergarten, I stayed up one evening to watch CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND with my parents on HBO. There are a lot of images in that movie that stand out and are memorable, but the one that stands out the most to me is the one where little Barry is running down the road up a hill past a white fence looking for lights. It wasn't until years later that I discovered this scene (as well as a few others) was inspired by INVADERS FROM MARS. Not only did it influence CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, but INVADERS FROM MARS influenced countless other sci-fi movies from INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHER to INDEPENDENCE DAY. I tried to find the movie at local video stores, but no one carried it. It wasn't until this 50th Anniversary Special Edition DVD was released that I was able to obtain a copy and view the movie for the first time.

The plot of the movie is fairly simple. Young David Maclean (Jimmy Hunt) sees a U.F.O. land in a sandpit over a hill by his house. He tells his parents and his dad goes to investigate. When he comes back home he is a completely different person. Other people David sees walking over the hill change, too. David notices markings on the backs of people's necks and it doesn't take David long to figure out there are aliens somewhere over the hill and they are taking over human bodies. David seeks out help from a woman doctor and a male astronomer. Together they get assistance from the military, leading to a final showdown in tunnels and the alien space craft underground

When I first watched INVADERS FROM MARS, I was amused by how out-dated much of the movie is. The aliens are referred as mutants (the movie's characters pronounce the word ""moo-tants"" instead of ""mute-nts""), most of them appear as people dressed up in green rubber suits, etc. Despite this, the movie still remains a certain amount of charm and has some rather great visual effects. Jimmy Hunt gives a great performance and Leif Erickson as David's father also provides a great turn from being such a loving father to one that is being controlled by aliens. Many of the visuals in the movie still retain much of their original power, from the hill with the broken fence, the swirling sand that swallows people, and the first few moments of seeing the interior of the alien tunnels. Also worth mentioning is the creepy music that still provides chills.

My biggest complaint about the movie is the ending. The final sequence is a cop out, one that has no connection to the movie and seems to have been tacked on at the last minute in an attempt at providing and extra thrill. Without any explanation, the sequence takes away from all the good things that happen in the movie.

The extras on the DVD include both the American original release and the alternative British version of the film, which has the better ending; a color theatrical trailer; a comprehensive still gallery; and an Easter Egg on the Extras menu that provides black and white trailers for several movies including BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA.

INVADERS FROM MARS isn't a great piece of science fiction, but it is an extremely influential one. It's a movie that all film buffs should see and one that serious ones will want to own.",1271980800,,3244,4.56701030927835

It caused me to be arfraid of the dark until I was at least 9. Maybe it was the fact that my Grandfather actually had a sand pit. It's still just as good now as it was back then. Seeing Leif Erickson and Milburn Stone out of their respective High Chapparel and Gunsmoke roles is a rare treat. Also a chance to witness the provocative ""Child Abuse"" seen where Leif smacks his sone and knocks him to the floor... Sure wasn't included in the 80s remake of the film with Karen Black.

My only issue (the reason I didn't give this classic film 5 stars) is this... If you look on the cover of the DVD it states it is a ""50th Anniversary, Special Edition"" of the film. You would think that with such a special release that someone would come up with the money to ""Digitally Remaster"" the film.

The first hint came from my daughter, who is a fan of ""Navy CIS"" and wanted to know more about some SCI-FI flick, which the ""DiNozzo""- character was referring to in the episode ""Vanished"".

When I received this special-edition DVD, I expected a common low-budget B-grade production, but to my surprise, this movie easily ranks with ""Rocketship X-M"" or ""This Island Earth"". Personally, I don't mind the somewhat mediocre quality of the video appearance. At any rate, this even adds to the dated and kitchy touch I prefer :-). As far as I understand, the original film material has been degraded over the years due to inadequate storage, and although digital remastering could have removed the worst hisses and scratches, it also would have altered some of the finer details of the original footage. After all, the video quality is not that bad, and after watching the movie a while, I didn't notice the defects anymore.

The stock footage which was used to depict the military build-up against the martians is a little long-winded, but nowadays it has some documentary value in its own right, which I appreciate (think of the Northrop flying-wing in ""War of the Worlds""). Among the shown vehicles are M10 tank destroyers, M8 ""Greyhound"" armored cars, M4 ""Shermans"" and even a M3 ""Stuart"" light tank, if I spotted the tank types correctly.

I think this DVD might be fun even for people like me who haven't seen this film in their youth. In any case it is well worth the money, if only to support those people who salvaged and restored this classic movie.",1264723200,8,1699,4.791808873720137

SYNOPSIS--
At 4:40 am, young David Maclean, an amateur astronomer, observes a flying saucer bury itself on a section of fenced high ground not far from his bedroom window. At the boy's urging, Mr. Maclean investigates and seems to disappear into the earth. The next morning he returns home, clearly not himself but hostile and in a sort of trance. David notices a small wound on the back of his dad's neck and gets slapped for commenting on it.

Soon David's mom, a general, two policemen, their chief and a neighbor girl that David also sees being sucked undrerground near the fence are acting differently. Young Kathy sets fire to her parents' basement, then collapses and dies from a hemorrhage caused by a small exploding glass tube buried at the base of her skull. The two affected policemen suddenly keel over and expire in the same way.

David convinces a local astronomer friend, a lady physician and an Army colonel that a spaceship is buried near his home. Even as he worries his parents will die from implanted probes, David and the others go underground to fight the Martian invaders.

It scared the daylights out of me when I first saw it and I can now see the creepy mindgame that was going on with this little kid in the movie, with his parents and almost everyone he knows turning into strange evil people and the haunting music and long scary shots of places like the police station and people falling through holes in the ground. And that guy in the globe...Yikes!
What was really interesting is that they did an alternate ending for the British release, which is on this DVD.  It would have been nice for the quality of the DVD to be a little better, but hey, it's in Color (that's how long it's been since I've seen it; I thought it was a black and white movie!) with no cuts and no commercials!

878018,4,6304401892,"Most who view INVADERS FROM MARS as teens remember it even decades later. What they take away from director William Cameron Menzies' seminal science fiction film is less the plot than Menzies' imaginative use of mood and stark imagery that causes them to feel the hackles rise on their necks even if they do not know why. As they view it again, this time with a more mature bent, they can place it in a political and social context that suggests that the America of the 1950s was a time of hidden foreign agents seeking to subvert our government. The seed pods of the later INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS caused much the same reaction.

As the film opens, ten year old Jimmy Hunt sees a UFO land in a sand pit near his house. A storm is raging but director Menzies inserts a weird blend of heavenly chorus music that he will use as a marker for alien activity.  The road leading to the pit is long and winding and the starkness of the surroundings lends a peculiarity of sensory image that is used throughout. One by one, his parents (Hillary Brooke and Leif Erikson) fall into the pit and are ""absorbed"" in a pre-Borg Star Trek way. Others in the town are similarly taken over.  As the townspeople become a threat, Jimmy first goes to the police station for help.  As he enters, he (and we in the audience) view the desk sergeant at the far end of a very long hallway, in a manner disturbingly reminiscent of the pathway to the sand pit. Much of the same use of camera angle and mood music continue to maintain the tone of an unsettling psychological retreat into paranoia.  Midway through, Menzies shifts gears into a standard thriller. He employs a nagging overuse of stock footage of tanks rumbling to the attack. Menzies strains audience credibility as Jimmy Hunt has no trouble convincing a doctor (Helena Carter), her astronomer boyfriend (Arthur Franz) and an army colonel (Morris Ankrum) that his claim that his parents are not who they seem to be. Further, during the army assault on the sand pit, there is no logical reason for Ankrum to assume that little Jimmy has knowledge of how to use the mutant raygun which they take from a fallen foe. However, perhaps I quibble on these points. The fact that INVADERS FROM MARS can still swoop a viewer back to the days of a callow youth is a powerful reminder that a masterful use of camera work, mood music, and solid acting can overcome even a ludicrous series of special effects.  INVADERS FROM MARS rightfully belongs on any ten best list of science fiction films.",1244246400,2,2523,4.558498896247241

878020,3,6304401892,"A little boy is the star of this film, and he does a fine job acting. Jimmy Hunt is his name, and he didn't have a big career acting, ""retiring"" at the end of the following year (1954). He was a decent child actor, as he shows here. He did come back to be part of the remake in 1986, playing the police chief and uttering one ironic and inside-joke line.

I thought the best part of this 1953 sci-fi classic was the beginning where Hunt really took center stage as the kid who saw a Martian UFO crash-land in a nearby area and then saw what the aliens did to his parents and others. I appreciated the fact the film didn't overdo the ""we-don't-believe-the-dumb kid-angle. It wasn't too long where people woke up to what was happening. This was made in the era, unlike the last few decades, in which Hollywood portrayed the U.S. military as the good guys.

There is no need to go into story details. The fun of the film is the corny lines here and there and, of course, the horrible special-effects, some of which will make you laugh out loud.

This was meant to scare kids 55 years ago but now, as adults, we just look at these films as ""campy"" or ""cheesy"" entertainment to give us laughs, and keep us entertained. For the most part, this film delivered in those areas.

Still, don't expect a ""masterpiece,"" or something that is so bad, it's great. It's kind of somewhere in the middle.",1235606400,,1385,4.3565891472868215
878021,4,6304401892,"Young David McLean (Jimmy Hunt) is the quintessential child that receives many compliments from adults; he's polite, works hard at school and always tells the truth.

But his life is in for a rough ride and the world is at risk when adults feel he is telling tall tales to get attention. And it all starts with some type of object crash landing into a sandpit near the McLean household.

People who whet their curiosity concerning the rumors of something strange being buried in the sand - including David's father - disappear for a period of time and reappear with extreme changes in their personalities. Two adults - Dr. Pat Blake (Helena Carter) and Dr. Stuart Kelston (Arthur Franz) - take David at his word, which sets off a perilous race against time to solve the mystery before more humans are ""controlled"" by the stranded aliens.

Nominated for a 1953 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, it is a swerve on ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf,"" because this young person is telling the truth.",1234396800,,994,4.7011494252873565
878095,3,6304401892,"This film begins with a view of the heavens. What can be out there? Young David sets his alarm to 4AM to view the nebulae. Later he is awakened by thunder and lightning. A flying saucer is on the horizon! His Dad puts this off until morning, but goes out to look around, and disappears. So do the two policemen who go to look for him. George returns, but acts strange. David visits the neighbors, they have a fire in their basement. David runs to talk to the police chief; but he has that mark on his neck! Doctor Blake arrives to help David. Did something happen to Mom too? There is no atmosphere in space and no friction. ""Synthetic humans?"" Did shooting rockets into space alarm any creatures lurking there?

Tanks and military vehicles are loaded onto a train. Pullman cars carry soldiers. The Sergeant goes to investigate, and is pulled into the sand! A strange device is found in the brain of that young girl. Troops arrive. Jackson and Blaine are caught, then drop dead. There is more drama when they find General Mayberry. The tanks surround the sandpit. A shot in the dark misses. Soldiers search for the Martians. David and Doctor Blake are captured! Can the soldiers save them? Can they escape from the sealed tunnel? Will that flying saucer escape from the earth? Will there be a happy ending? What about next time?

This film may have been scary when it was made, but it now has comic aspects. Did the low budget cause this? Is there a political message in having a young boy save the planet by warning the elders? Or just a gimmick to create an audience among schoolchildren? Is there a hidden message in telling how a hierarchical society must invade and loot other planets?",1232755200,,1690,4.555921052631579

That's the frustration of David, the young boy in the movie who can't get anyone to listen to him.  When he does get a sympathetic ear, he spots the ""mark"" on the back of their necks indicating they've already been brainwashed by the martians.  It was bad enough to see the spaceship land out behind his home, but then his parents get caught and brainwashed too!  Then the policeman is the same way.  The story is good and keeps you interested even though you do chuckle throughout the movie.  The special effects are nothing like todays standards, but this is another one of those great classic sci-fi movies that's fun to watch.  The thing that made me laugh the most was the sound that always came about when the sand was opening up for the people to fall through.  Sounded more like a chorus of people singing than something eerie but effective anyway.  Definitely worth adding to your collection of classic sci-fi / monster movies.",1224547200,5,1097,4.671875

878101,3,6304401892,"INVADERS FROM MARS is another great old sci-fi film that I remember from my youth.  I could only grant the film three stars today but would have gladly rated it four stars as a child of the 50's.  This film had outstanding screen images, interesting sound effects, great music, wonderful sets, and a basic theme which would be frightening to any kid who remembers desperately trying to convince ""grownups"" of anything.

Memorable screen images included: the classic saucer shape descending out of a dark stormy sky towards the earth, the scary looking fence on the hill out back, the green mindless slaves and the ""head man"" of Mars.  The music was haunting, including the often repeated theme conveyed by vocals and beautiful flutes.  Many of the sets were simple but effective, using a good solid dose of forced perspective, color and symbolism.  Good vs bad folks were simply represented using black and white for costumes, in the well worn tradition of the American western.

I must agree with one comment made by others about the moderate quality of the DVD transfer.  An accurate reproduction was made of every flaw and scratch in the original film stock (along with clear portions of the film).  I am surprised a better quality original could not be found for such an important example of early American sci-fi film.  However, it did not really interfere with enjoying the movie.

One last comment, the science presented by the local town astronomer, along with the good fiction of the story, was very poor and almost an embarrassment to any fan with a decent high school science education. What the hey, it was only the 50's and the film was mainly for kids.

Think how far we have come from films like Invaders from Mars in the early 50's, 2001 in the late 60's, to the current stock and trade of great sci-fi films having great special effects presented by the current masters of this film genre.",1218412800,,1906,4.759878419452887

It was released in full, gloriously rich color, as I well remember; on its initial UK release this film blew a galaxy-wide hole in my consciousness (I was a very young child - 3 years old when it was released), and my fate was sealed - I became a lifelong movie lover and specifically a SciFi/Horror aficionado. And those passions have never deserted me, have consoled and inspired me through the years, kept me sane when all about me were apparently losing their minds, and still keep my imagination going at full throttle.

At seven bucks it's not a bad deal, but if I had paid twenty-seven for it, I would have been sick.
Not that this is a bad movie. Its just not on the same tier as Forbidden Planet, War of the Worlds, When Worlds Collide, etc. To rate it 5 stars would be far too generous, so based on the movie alone it gets four stars.
But then there is the terrible video quality. The picture has vertical wear lines off and on throughout the movie and often the picture is so dark that the action is incomprehensible. Oops, there goes another star.
On the positive side the director did a good job of conveying the boy's paranoia in an adult world.

First of all I take exception that some reviews keep mentioning the zippers in the back of the martian's.  What did they expect, magnetic clasp, buttons, hooks and loops?  Unless you were expecting to see naked martians I'd say the zippers are just fine--they are wearing cloths and shoes you know.  Nor do I really believe it falls into campy--so old it is amusingly funny.  I feel they did a fine job except for that ""mutant"" crack they kept using as an excuse to have martian slaves or servants.  The obvious science involved in this film (inside the spaceship) looked fine to me--and who cares if they turned over a can of latex paint and blew bubbles through it to simulate the martians melting walls of dirt...it looked fine to me.

This movie, though a popcorn movie, is still somewhat serious and acted very well by the kid and all the cast.

So let's get to it.

PROS:

1.  Neat idea carried out properly.

2.  Fine acting, that's a star.

3.  Written just fine, that's a star, lots of tense moments and no filler I could spot, no sub plots.

4.  Neat special effects.

5.  Look at how those cuties dressed.  I remember them from when I was a kid.  Look at the scene where the kid runs to his mother at night.  She wakes up, hair is brushed, lips properly lipsticked, the correct amount of war paint around the eyes.  Yes sir, maybe we shouldn't tell them that the realitly was they all went to bed in curls and cold cream.  But I got to tell you, did they all look like that outside the house...well, they tried to.

six.  Just got to the end of the British version, I think there's a couple extra scenes in it!

7.  Movie starts out with the right type of science fiction music and background paintings and voice-over of the day.  On the back of the case it says 1953--the year I was born.  They did a fine job making this a character study as well as an action movie.  Even when the General's sergeant got sucked into the hole and the General says to the man restraining him, ""Renaudies' been with me twenty years...we may have no counter weapon but if it's a fight they want they're going to get it!""  Even that one line character study is sufficent to understand the General's mind set.  Yes...above average writing.

8.  Lots of stock footage showing the Army packing up equipment and moving it to the site.  So what, you can't have a military unit go on manuevers just so you can get some new stock footage for a movie...not even back then.

I don't see any reason to go futher.  This is one of those old classical science fiction movies that cries for popcorn and a deeper study to get its' full impact.  CONS:  There really aren't any no matter what everybody else says.  The only thing you could have done better is updating the special effects and we've seen what Hollywood does when it remakes a movie--so we don't want that!

Looking at it more...no, definitly well written, acted and directed.

So that's it, Buy, don't rent.",1179964800,7,3032,4.426497277676951

878202,4,6304401892,"While not quite in the same rarified ""B"" movie air that classics such ""War of  the Worlds"", ""The Thing"", ""Forbidden Planet"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", and of course, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" are found, ""Invaders From Mars"" is just a notch or two below.  The strong plot line (Martians in a flying saucer land on (under?) the Earth to attempt a take-over) from this 1953 film led to a number of copy-cat films (including the aforementioned ""War of the Worlds"" which came out the same year) and later films, like ""Independence Day"".

Many of the criticisms about this film revolve around the overuse of stock footage (not at all unusual for films of this era - although annoying) and the cheesy costumes of the Martian ""Mu-Tants""(as they were called in the film).  Green felt jump suits with visible zippers, no less.  In some ways these criticisms are unfair because they come from film goers who are used to the CGI-generated special effects of 21st Century filmmaking.  ""Invaders From Mars"" and most of the other films of this era were funded on a shoestring budget and had to cut corners in those departments in order to get the approval of the picture company.  My advice is to stay in the past when viewing these great Sci Fi films of that long-gone era for better appreciation.

All in all, ""Invaders From Mars"" is a wonderfully made, filmed, and acted movie from this genre'.  One of the highlights is that the film is one of the first color Sci Fi movies of its kind.  Young Jimmy Hunt is very believable as the young protagionist in the film.  As always, Morris Ankrum is solid as the avenging Army commander who takes on the ""nasties"".  (I've lost count as to how many times Ankrum plays this role in these movies.)  And, Leif Erickson, as Jimmy's father, dominates the screen when he is shown - a quality that would serve him well in later movies and television shows.

""Invaders From Mars"" should be on the bookshelf or in the DVD cabinet of every collector of '50s & '60s Sci Fi classics. Its appeal transcends generations!",1166832000,5,2050,4.62707182320442
878203,5,6304401892,"This movie scared me to death as a child.  I literally couldn't sleep for days. Perhaps I was the perfect specimen for suspension of disbelief, but, as a child I had the advantage, if you call it that, of believing that whatever I saw in a movie actually happened as it appeared in film. Thus, when the space ship crashed in David's backyard, I was looking out of my own bedroom window. I insisted on seeing the back of my parent's necks. Afterall, I always thought they acted a little strange. If you like old science fiction, this one is a true classic.  While the special effects were limited to the technology of 1952, I feel they were very adequate and added to the realism, unlike the computer generated special effects that everyone instantly knows is fake. Happy viewing and pass the popcorn!",1162080000,15,800,4.5874125874125875
878271,5,6304401892,"Along with `The Day the Earth Stood Still' and `The Forbidden Planet', `Invaders From Mars' is one of the most memorable sci-fi flicks for me from the 50s.

I saw it at the drive-in theatre first, huddled in the backseat pulling the blanket over my head every time the `scary aliens' would appear.  The bold and glowing colors of that first viewing stuck in my memory through countless subsequent viewings of the film on our rabbit-eared black & white TV.

The love/fear thing we have with what terrifies us is what makes the sci-fi and horror genre so popular.  We remember for years what scared us as children, and even though we may have outgrown that fear, the kernel of our initial horror still lingers within us.

When this film became available on DVD, I wasn't so sure if my 13 and 11 year old sons would enjoy it as much as I had.  Raised on heavy FX and CGI horror & sci-fi epics of the 2000s, these guys might not embrace the modest cinematic effects, the ""Gee whiz"" 50's dialogue, or the nave typical military response of a film of 50 years before.  I knew it would be tame (and parentally safe) compared to recent films they'd seen.

Their response surprised me.  They liked it and bought into it all.  In my zeal to show my kids something cool from my youth, I forgot the essential elements which riveted me to the film---The eerily back-lit sand pit with the broken fence; the weird musically-moaning `voices' as people are sucked down the sandy whirlpool;  the deep-down terror that your parents have changed into people you don't know or that mean you harm; the bizarre, loping gait of the kidnapper aliens coming to get me; the frustration of a ten year old boy whose truth-telling nobody believes; the snaky tendrils of The Leader alien pulling you closer to the zombie-maker needle device.  And my guys were hooked to those same things.

The test of a classic movie is that it spans generations.  `Invaders from Mars' has been memorable for three of them in my family.  Who knows, maybe my sons will be showing it to their kids some day.",1161475200,12,2057,4.551630434782608
878272,4,6304401892,"I have fond memories of being terrified watching THE MILLION DOLLAR MOVIE on TV in NY. The Crawling Eye is great fun to see again....THEM was even better. Really a Classic. I thought Invader from Mars would be really eerie, but the print is very old and the night scenes are almost too dark to see. Still the alternate British ending was interesting. For anyone who grew up in the 50's and 60's this is a fun trip into the past.",1156550400,5,428,4.296296296296297
878273,5,6304401892,"If you are a fan of early SciFi movies, this is a must-have for your library. There are some classic shot sequences that have been honored in more recent films, and you should look for these. For example, Spielberg must be a big fan. Pay attention to the shot compositions for the field (fence, lighting, etc.) and seek out homages to be found in Close Encounters and War of the Worlds.

It is also highly informative to note the perspectives used for social mores, and for science in general. In today's world, the notion that ""the town scientist"" would turn his astonomical telescope into the daylight sky and view heavenly objects, then turn it below the horizontal and look across the countryside to view the goings on at a top secret military base, are both hoots. That the scientist sees a classic rocketship and knows simply by the form that it is ""atomic"", is classic. One can only imagine the wonder that science and the future held for the popular mind back then that the writers could get away with that kind of stuff.

And yet, in contrast, note the strong presentation of the female role, not as a nurse, but as a doctor who makes the initial tough decisions and takes charge of the situation, driving the story forward. Very progressive, when contrasted with the ""scientist love interest who exists to admire the brilliance, bravery and manhood of the hero"" found in the typical films of this genre and era. Admittedly, our heroine is subjected to those stereotypes later on in the story, which is disappointing.

I also love the military response. This is shortly after WWII. Because some kid has a bug up his tail, we roll the tanks onto the trains and storm the town. Commanding officers up on rooftops with binoculars!!

In summary, our modern levels of sophistication might diminish this film to Mystery Science Theater, but that would be unfair. Instead, I recommend watching it once for the sheer joy of it. Then, watch it a second time with a more critical eye and have all your laughs and pick out all your iconic scenes for future reference.",1155859200,5,2065,4.680440771349862

878276,4,6304401892,"'Invaders from Mars' released in '52 was undoubtedly one of the truly scary films of my childhood. Who wouldn't be frightened at the prospect of awakening from sleep one night just in time to observe a flying saucer descend onto your backyard and somehow mysteriously disappear into the ground without leaving a trace.

Such was the opening sequence of this unforgettable alien invasion as the Martian begin to abduct humans with the help of a devise that opens the ground out from under their prey causing them to fall into the arms of one of the mutant giants waiting below the surface. When returned to the surface the victims were no longer as they were before, they were now under the control of the aliens via a devise implanted at the base of their skull. Pretty spooky stuff don't you think.

While weak on special effects the film has a dream-like quality to it that's absolutely mezmerizing to such a degree that the shortcomings in production values tend to go unnoticed. The storyline is solid and thought provoking and the acting is excellent. Jimmy Hunt is amazing as little David MacLean, the boy who knows what's going on, as is Helena Carter as Dr. Pat Blake the adult who finally comes to believe David's improbable tale of invasion.",1146614400,4,1251,4.73394495412844

True, the crawling eye itself is not Jurassic Park scarey but My 19 year old daughter even enjoyed it! Invaders from Mars was pretty good too, although the aliens are kinda corney it's still a fun movie to watch.

878278,5,6304401892,"As another reviewer so aptly said, the real fear in this movie is that of watching your parents, (and your friends!) the biggest influences and the only stable influences in your life as a child, change into ice-cold automatons. You can deal with anything life throws your way if you have your parents and friends, but in this movie, you have neither. The Martians are, IMO, absolutely scary and believable as you watch the movie through David's eyes...it is his POV we see the entire movie with and this is what lends the credibility throughout.

The Head Martian, carried about in his bowl, is really bizarre; a head with tentacles coming out the bottom and sides.

But my favorite part of all is the Sand Pit, where the Voices are heard and when the Voices begin, someone is about to join the Martians (or as David calls them, ""MUTANTS!"") in their hiding place beneath.

The implant of a tiny device in the back of the human brain is what the Martians use to control us...and it is great classic 1950s SciFi.

The music score is fantastic and the sound effects and set design are what really set this one apart from all others of the genre. Considering this was made in 1953, it is a true masterpiece, IMO. If you've never seen it, you're in for a real treat. What's so fascinating too is, watching this movie today, the personality changes in the parents and friends of David are far more terrifying than all of the high tech CGI and stunts used to sell movies today. If your own personal world is corrupted, then everything else doesn't matter; no safe haven...on the other hand, if you have your friends and family, you can deal with literally anything life throws your way. No matter what you are going through, think how it would be if you were really alone...all alone.

Join David on this great excursion onto the world of a child in a far more innocent time and see what happens when Martians, for a time, take control over his world.",1139616000,15,1945,4.52991452991453

Anyway, the movie itself is very good and has some great parts. The little girl who sets fire to her basement is classic. When she smiles eerily at the camera ala 'Bad Seed' the director definatly nailed what he was after.

The mutants are awesome too. Check out how they walk and run around like they're on some weird drugs or something. Watching them is hilarious. Also the Brain-Being in the fish bowl is a hoot. Check him out, he looks like a Wizard of Oz reject with the silver paint and little octopus arms. Sinister yet goofy, that's always a plus when watching these flicks.

Surprisingly the hero, little David is not at all aggravating. Usually these kids are so bad they make the movie impossible to watch, but the little kid did a good job. Not like watching Dougie Howser or something. He played the scene real good in the police station when his mother came to get him. Speaking of the police station, what an eerie place that was! It looked like a weird corridor to another world, just plain white walls with a police desk what seamed 50 feet high down a long empty hallway. I mean seriously, would you go there for help?

The old colonal was pretty cool too. That old wardog wasn't about to give the Red Menace an inch. (Get it red menace? The Communist Russians were known as Reds, as Mars is the red planet? That's what this movie was really about, fighting communism. McCarthy wanted everyone to think that as communist forces took over countries, the citizens would act like braindead drones such as the good wholesome Americans acted as they got brain controlled by the Martians in this movie. The Red Scare was everywhere, espescially in Hollywood.)

There's something very sinister going on and David's convinced that it has something to do with that spaceship . . . but who will believe him? This film is still effective, not because of the special effects and costumes (check out the green velvet alien suits!) but because it plays to our primal fear of being allienated from those around us, and the horror that some force could remove those distinctions that define human individuality.

The set up of the plot is really well down, as has been described here in other reviews, the boy unearths a plot by aliens to take over and control humans, but once we start seeing the seemingly endless montage of military vehicles being brought into place around where the alien ship supposedly is, the film just loses it.

I didn't buy it because I thought it was a quality movie or for the storyline, though, honestly, forty years later it does have some high points. I think the 'head' of the alien one of the best, especially back in those days. One feels the emptiness of the moment, not because of creativity and production, but because of the sparse set. It's bleak and barren, and actually works if one has the necessary creativity within one's imagination.

The acting is wooden, the dialogue is straight out of classroom films, and the special effects worse than Wood's. Only Robot Monster comes close to this bottom-rung effort and at least Robot Monster had some interesting beefcake.

When a young boy sees an alien spaceship land in a field, he finds that not only don't most adults believe him, but they start acting very strangely....

The alien costumes are laughable by today's standards, but young kids still get a thrill out of this classic, and many elements are still effective.  The music is very good and the atmosphere of tension created with extreme close-ups, for instance.

One problem is the acting.  Those who have been probed by the aliens act wooden, but sometimes it's difficult to tell the probed actors from those who are just plain bad!  The female lead is the exception in an otherwise goofy cast.

Also in the papers nudging out the top stories and making headlines of their own was a brand new phenomenon known as Flying Saucers. The term had been coined just six years prior and sightings of these objects had reached a crescendo around the time of the production of this movie. In fact in 1952 when production started there were several incidents of jets being dispatched over Washington,D.C. in a futile attempt to intercept formations of these ""visitors"".The population was quite cognisant of these things and since movies sometimes reflect the times we live in it just followed that Hollywood would wade in  with their version of things.
The 50s became awash in alien invasion pictures,some good,some bad. One of the good ones was ""Invasion From Mars"".
With a low budget and sparse sets but ALOT of heart this picture hit the target many times over. It had a different approach to its subject matter in thought and execution than many films of its' day with many times the budget.
This is the film I first saw in the 50s and on TV(although depending on the station and its' quota of commercials its' length could become quite truncated!).
There are two version here,the British and American. And it's wonderful to have both on the same disc for comparison.
However I can only in good conscience give this a 3 1/2 star rating. The film in and of itself gets most of the marks. The film print used however is the problem here.
While the print is technically a clear one in so far as the background and actors are concerned,the surface scratches evident throughout,especially on the American version,really ruin ones' enjoyment while watching it.
For example in the first approximately nine minutes of the American version there is a terrible scratch that runs constantly down the middle of the frame and this is a bright and thick one. And this is frequently joined by others to its' sides. While it does diminish in time others' take its'place albeit of a lesser nature throughout the film,but it is all in all still very disconcerting.
There are also areas of noticeable colour fading and loss that I was surprised to see in both versions.
Considering the price that Image Entertainment commands for this disc and the technology available and in use that could easily wipe such incongruities off the final print,I find it unbelievable and unconscionable that they would dare release a good film like this with such obvious flaws.
This is a shame for this film deserves a little better than this and unfortunately the viewing public have been let down.
So Caveat Emptor to everyone thinking of purchasing this product. If you know the flaws and can ""hack"" them then you'll be fine,if not......stay away until the next time.",1092096000,7,2941,4.8353174603174605
878362,4,6304401892,"This film is a wonderful childhood fantasy. Though the story is merely of comic book quality, the film's strength lies in its preservation of the hairstyles, fashion styles, mannerisms, speech patterns, and technological naivete of the era in which it was filmed. It involves a young boy who learns of a martian invasion, and his attempts to alert authorities after his parents are brainwashed by the invaders. The acting is unfortunately not on a par with some other films from this era, but it isn't entirely abyssmal either. The transformation in their behavior after the martians have their way is so stark it's laughable, but this is an example of the naive idiom I mentioned earlier. Additionally, the film is replete with stock footage of military operations framed by patriotic anthems playing in the background, a cliche spawned by the paranoia of the Cold War era.

 This edition features an alternate version of the film with a different ending, a nice extra I never knew existed. However, the quality of the video transfer is poor; this film is badly in need of complete restoration, a task complicated by the fact of its unusual two-sided composition. This process gives the film a dark look, which helped to hide the zippers down the backs of the martian mutants (pronounced ""mute ants"" by the actors in the film). This incongruity beautifully demonstrates the differences between our own technically literate society and that of only 50 years ago, a world without microwave ovens or cell phones, the internet, or DVD players, and of the psychology of that society. Watching this film with an open mind will give the viewer a rare glimpse into a vanished world, and for that reason alone it's worth seeing.",1091318400,3,1720,4.927586206896552

And while this is certainly an improvement over the grainy print I owned, I have to say I'm a little disappointed that the film still isn't in great shape.  A good portion of the outdoor scenes are pretty murky, making it hard at times to tell what is going on.  Some scratches and minor imperfections are to be expected (even though, with today's film restoration technology, I think even these can be fixed).  And to be fair, this was a low-budget film that may never have looked that great.  I guess I was just hoping for more.
Now, a word about the two versions of the film on this disc.  I don't want to give away the ending(s) to anyone who hasn't seen it, but let's just say the original U.S. ending has been considered by many fans to be a ""cop out"" ending.  The British version does away with that, as well as the ridiculously long montage that proceeds it.  But here's an odd thing: I still think I prefer the more ambigious U.S. ending.  It's just more...I don't know....FUN.
So maybe this is the best version of INVADERS FROM MARS we'll ever get.  It's a fun movie, a minor classic of the beloved genre of 50's sci-fi films.

878432,3,6304401892,"My three stars are based on the following--four stars for this memorable film--two stars for the picture and sound quality of the DVD. Some of the other reviewers will consider my technical ""two stars"" to be generous, and I will not argue with
them.

I first saw this landmark sci/fi classic when I was younger than Jimmy Hunt, the lead actor in ""Invaders"". Like many other ""baby boomers"", I remember the experience very well. It wasn't the Martians who bothered me--it was the idea that your own loving parents could suddenly become so ""different"", not to mention friends and neighbours. This is a very frightening premise that reached its peak a couple of years later in the original ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"".

Inevitably, the film is now dated in a number of ways--the ""zippers"" on the backs of the Martians are often mentioned--but it still has power too. First of all, Jimmy Hunt's performance--here is a child actor who is totally believable, and his efforts to convince people of the unthinkable are compelling. Children who are not taken seriously--an old theme that is still relevant. Arthur Franz and Helena Carter are standard 50s leads, sympathetic but bland, but look out for Leif Erickson as our hero's ""Dad""--the scene where he comes back home a ""changed man"" still packs a wallop ( literally as well as figuratively ).

As others have noted, Menzies gave this film a terrific"" look--that hill with the broken fence, the swirling sand, the strange music--this is an image that has stayed with me most of my life.
The ""Martian Brain"" may look a little crude today, but the idea of superior intelligence is a mainstay in science fiction, and this creature has numerous filmic descendants--the ""brainy alien"" in ""Independence Day"", another more recent ""invasion"" comes to mind.

One problem I have always had with this movie--and it is a common experience in 50s sci/fi films--is an excessive reliance on stock footage. I guess it helped with the budget, but all those ""military training"" films that are woven into the story could have been edited. OK--the troops are coming to kick Martian butt--we get it !

It is safe to say that this is one of the most influential sci/fi movies of all time. True it does not compare in quality to some other 50s classics--""The Day the Earth Stood Still "",
""The War of the Worlds"", ""Forbidden Planet"" for example. Nevertheless, it is a movie that is embedded in the consciousnesses of many people of my generation--the saucer landing, the scared little boy, the strange hill where people disappear--all quite unforgettable.

Sadly, I must agree with the negative reviews of this DVD's picture quality--when you mention ""50th Anniversary Special Edition"" etc. and see that the company responsible is Image--you have high expectations. I did not anticipate so many lines and general ""wear and tear"". If this was the best print available, it is unfortunate. If anything, the nice cover and the interesting booklet add to the disappointment of the disc itself.

Bottom line--even with the visual shortcomings of the DVD, no serious sci/fi collector can leave this title out of his or her collection.",1051574400,151,3152,4.947069943289225

878491,4,6304401892,"""Invaders From Mars"" was the first science fiction film made in color and one that tries to make the most of Cold War paranoia.  Young David MacLean (Jimmy Hunt) sees strange lights settling behind a hill near his house and then notices that all the adults in town start acting really strange.  However, it turns out not to be Commies in them thar hills, but alien invaders of a different kind and David is going to need some help.  This is happening in the backyard of David's California home is because his father, George (Leif Erickson), is a scientist at the local top secret base where they are working on an atomic powered rocket to go to Mars.  George goes off to investigate (he is a scientist, therefore he is curious) and returns a changed man.  When David notices the small wound at the base of his father's skull, his mind starts the leap to the astounding conclusion.  Fortunately, David has found a more than friendly face in the person of Dr. Pat Blake (Helena Carter) who can help him save his parents, the locals, and, well, the entire world.
This 1953 film was also the last one directed by William Cameron Menzies, who is best known as the production designer on ""Gone With the Wind"" but who also directed ""Things to Come,"" the 1936 science fiction classic based on the H.G. Wells novel.  This is not a special effects film, which is rather surprising given the decision to make it in color.  Most of the film bears the stamp of Menzies' direction, which resulted in a rather dream-like quality to what is going on that is rather unique for a Fifties Science Fiction film.  This becomes particularly effective because the film is obviously geared at adolescents, not only in terms of its young protagonist but also in terms of materializing the traditional fears of adolescents (your parents and every adult in town is out to make sure you have no fun whatsoever).  Menzies also deserves credit for the fantastic set of the hill leading up to the sand pit.
The conclusion of this film is the weakest part, on several levels, ranging from the level of special effects and zippered alien costumes to the ""epilogue"" (you will understand when you see the film).  But that is a traditional criticism of most films, whether you are talking science fiction or not: the payoff is not as good as the set up (the hill set overlooking the sand pit was so great that whatever was down there on the other side was not go to match the high expectations built up over the course of the film).  Still, ""Invaders From Mars"" is a prime example of Fifties Sci Fi Paranoia, along with ""It Came From Outer Space"" and ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers.""  ""Invaders From Mars"" was remade by director Tobe Hooper in 1986, with Jimmy Hunt now playing the Police Chief, but the new version has nothing of the elegance of the original, which is the one you need to see at least once as part of your alien invasion movie heritage.",1035072000,,2923,4.5659655831739965

This is one of those Grade B sci-fis from the early 50s that scared the bejesus out of kids who grew up on TV in the early to mid sixties, as it played almost every other Saturday morning on the rabbit-eared black-and-white. Post-mod critics contend it was a 'cold war' film whose subtext warned America of the evils of Communism, but one could just as easily posit it a warning of falling into any 'popular mind'.
What lifted INVADERS above most low-budget widgets of that period was Menzies' super production design: the designer-director had a great gift for queasy imagery (ok, call him a 50s Lynch if you must), and a lot of that is on display here, as mentioned above.
Jimmy Hunt turns in a good performance as the spooked kid who may be dreaming, or not.  Mom and Dad are your typical good-looking 50s archetypes, and contribute well to the sense of menace suffered by the poor kid.

878495,2,6304401892,"The 1953 (original) Invaders from Mars, directed by William Cameron Menzies, opens with an epilogue about the importance of science.  It then quickly switches to a scene in which we are introduced to an idyllic family: a doting father and mother and their scientifically precocious son.  The father is an engineer working on a top-secret project (""Mary, you know I can't talk about that"").  The son is looking out of a telescope in the middle of the night when a flying saucer happens to land in his bucolic backyard, only to be swallowed up by the sand dunes behind the house.  The father, incredulous at first, goes out to investigate, only to return a changed man.  David, the son (played by Jimmy Hunt ), is certain his father has changed because of Zombie-like expression and his dramatically different personality.  David's suspicions are further confirmed when he discovers his father has a small but bloody protrusion on the back of his neck.  This turns out to be a crystalline device that alien invaders (Martians) have used to take control of the father's mind and destroy his personal volition.  A large number of other townspeople are subsequently swallowed up by the sand dunes and emerge to wreck havoc on the little town (e.g., a sweet little girl becomes demonic and burns down her mother's home). A local health official, Dr. Pat Blake, befriends David and appears to be the only person willing to place any credence in his story.  She confirms the intellectual plausibility of his claims by consulting with a scientist she is dating, and together she and her boyfriend rally the military to take on the alien invaders.  The military use altogether conventional weapons (tanks and dynamite) to fight the invaders, but appear determined and equal to the task.  (""If it's a fight they want, they're going to get it!"").  The Martians are large green automatons, wearing jump suits and goggles, who comically lumber through the underground caverns they create.  The are controlled by a multi-armed being who apparently lives in a bubble, incapable of even rudimentary ambulation, despite the assertion that ""He is mankind developed to its ultimate intelligence.""  This being has bloodshot eyes and never speaks, but constantly casts nervous, furtive glances from side to side as the battle unfolds. David and the beautiful Dr. Blake are eventually swallowed up by the sand and taken captive by the green men.  Tension builds as we watch a whirring needle about to pierce the nubile neck of Dr. Blake; fortunately, she and David are rescued before penetration actually occurs.  The spacecraft emerges from the earth like a large, pustulant boil about to erupt; however, the munitions of the Army ultimately prove to be effective and equal to the task of defending the country.  The saucer is blown apart at the last possible moment. Some critics have suggested that Invaders from Mars is the classic cold war film.  It suggests paranoia regarding nuclear warfare and the development of new weapons that we cannot comprehend (e.g., rayguns).  The enemy surreptitiously positions itself while the town leaders sleep, and everyone refuses to believe only person who really comprehends the full magnitude of the impending destruction.  Good eventually triumphs over evil, but the triumph may be illusory - David awakens from what turns out to be only a nightmare, goes to the window, and then sees the identical flying saucer once again landing in the backyard.  It is clear that constant vigilance is the price we pay to avert conquest by alien enemies.",984787200,3,3563,5.01528013582343

I would recommend that you get the VHS copy, because the DVD version  is horrible!! This is why I have given it 3 stars. No remastering has been  do to it! Still, buy the VHS.

878498,5,6304401892,"My only regret when i watch this film is that, although i have read that it was made in 3D, (apparently) no 3D prints still exist.  That's sad, because i can imagine that the effect of several of the sets would be even  greater in 3D.
The basic plot is fairly well-known -- boy sees flying  saucer land and hide itself in a sand-pit near his home, sees his father  captured by aliens, and can't make anyone believe him till it's almost Too  Late.
This is a film designed to play to several of the things that  children feel even if they can't voice them clearly -- that adults are  arbitrary and uncaring, that no-one listens to what kids have to say, and  so on.  The visual design (Menzies was, after all, primarily a designer)  plays to that quite well.  Since the main part of the film is, apparenly,  revealed as a dream, Menzies can go in for such surreally-portrayed sets as  the police station, in which the desk sergeant's desk looms so far above  the boy who is trying to report horrible events, and almost the only other  feature of the set is the clock on a wall far away. (Imagine that shot in  3D).
And, yes, the costumes of the ""aliens"" are a bit cheesey,  and the special effects are almost fifty years out of date... but these are  details, and minor ones; the film as a whole does a wonderful job of  capturing a childhood nightmare and making us, if only briefly, live it and  recall what it was like to be a child...
((The recent wonderful film  ""The Iron Giant"" includes a brief visual homage to this film...))",959472000,11,1531,4.358156028368795
878499,5,6304401892,"This film is a true classic!  It scared me half to death when I was a kid, and my best friend still does an excellent job of making  that  bubbling sound when the aliens boil and dissovle walls in their paths. I  absolutely love this film.  Yes, I know it was made around the time of the  cold war paranoia, but I think it has more to do with wierd aliens and  wierd sounds and science fiction than fear of any human political systems.  You have to buy this film if only to see that cool little guy in the glass  bottle with the shifty eyes.",957312000,2,541,4.028301886792453

7871286,3,6304401892,"Surely one of the classic alien invasion flicks of the 1950s, with a cornball, child-like storyline: A little boy witnesses a Martian flying saucer landing, tries to tell everyone, only to discover that the Martians are mind-controlling about half the town, including his parents and the chief of police.

Fortunately, the U.S. Army comes to the rescue, bombing and blasting the Martians out of their subterranean stronghold outside town.

Bit of a clichd ""surprise"" ending, with the little boy apparently awaking from this feature-length nightmare to find his parents and the world are perfectly alright.  But, then, glancing out the window once more, he sees a Martian flying saucer landing FOR REAL this time.  Gee Whiz!!

Appears to be entirely shot in the studio, with some pretty daft sets (a truly cavernous police station with what must be 20-foot ceilings) and ridiculous Martian costuming (big, lumbering guys dressed in green velvet pajamas with zippers up the back).  Color is muted, not vibrant, looks about ten generations away from the master print.

Cute movie for kids (well, 1950s kids, who weren't anywhere near as spineless and oversensitive as kids today), but worth a look just for fun.",1523145600,,1208,5.13265306122449

I really liked those fat ""mutants"" that waddled around in loose green pajamas in the underground tunnels!
Kind of dumb how some people would not see the hole that would open up right in front of them, and they would fall right in.
I remember seeing this movie as a kid and it seemed awful scary to me back then. Now it's just corn ball entertainment with hokey special effects.
It's good for a rainy afternoon when working on a model of the B-24.",1520726400,,481,4.2967032967032965
