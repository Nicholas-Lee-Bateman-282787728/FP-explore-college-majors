6396255,5,B00JX3SHIC,"The town is bathed in sunlight and is imposssibly clean, shining and populated with good people. The doctors, nurses, police and townspeople have their issues but are good decent folk and will find their way to doing the right thing. Perhaps this version of 1950s small town America never did exist except in the imagination or on film but even if it didn't - one wishes it really had rather than the versions of Sinclair Lewis's small town America described in his novels ""Babbitt"" and ""Main Street"". But in ""Good Morning Miss Dove"" the town and its residents are the unbilled stars of the film !!

The movie story line is simple. Ms. Dove {Jennifer Jones} the schools long serving, severe spinster teacher suddenly takes ill and faces a serious life threating operation. As the word spreads - the whole town realizes how many of them she has helped, influenced and molded for the better in her own serious and uncompromising way. As Ms Dove lays in her hospital bed, steely willed and dry eyed she reflects on her life, the choices she made and in flashback scenes we see the good she has done for her students and town by her personnel integrity and willingness to sacrifice self in interest of the commom good. And the townsfolk respond to her illness in a way that is as improbale as it is uplifting - that Ms Dove is revered and beloved but they are just then realizing this !!

In 2014, a storyline of this nature may be considered to be impossible and implausible and YET when you view this movie IT WORKS !!  If you ask me how or why , my best answer is that it succeeds thru the emotions it engendered within the its simple scenario that is so honestly portrayed that will truly tug at your heartstrings. Director Henry Koster wrings every last drop of emotion and entertainment value - he is a very underrated director and he positions his camera perfectly for all the films big and intimate individual set piece scenes.

Robert Stack , Robert Douglas and a young, awkward {pre TV ""Rifleman"" and 'Branded""} Chuck Connors lend stalward support but this is Ms. Jones film ""Lock, stock and Barrell""! Her restrained performance dominates the film by  every word, body language, clipped / nuanced speach and gesture - she infuses Ms. Dove with warmth and humanity despite the outward personna as cold and severe.

To some, this movie may seem to be dated Hokum and overly sentimental but I found it to be a marvelous trip in the ""Way Back Machine"" to a time /era /place less complicated, simpler than today that probaly never really existed any more than Andy Griffiths ""Mayberry"" could have. But that doesn't matter in regards to my recommendation of this movie as an engrossing and rewarding viewing experience espiscally as entertainment for the family and I give it a 5 star rating.",1400112000,37,2792,4.653144016227181
6396256,4,B00JX3SHIC,"Miss Dove comes across as a holier-than-thou saintly teacher and the suds flow freely. Good production value however and shown in widescreen, but in the 4:3 ratio. It's better than pan & scan though. Jennifer Jones acts and speaks like no one I ever heard of and sounds rather phony. But you get hooked. Pleasant and entertaining.",1399680000,,330,4.807017543859649

6396258,4,B00JX3SHIC,"I've always liked this film and had been waiting for some time for a studio release.  If you read carefully in their write up--Amazon says that it is being shown in 4:3 letter box.  It isn't anamorphic wide screen, but if their write up is accurate, it will at least be widescreen instead of pan and scan.

If their info is accurate, I'll probably adjust this to 4 stars---if not........

5-19 update:  Indeed, this is letter boxed so they have avoided the dreaded pan and scan.  And ""Good Morning Miss Dove"" is a delightful (even if it is overly sentimental) film.  The cast of Jennifer Jones, Robert Stack, Chuck Connors, Kipp Hamilton, Peggy Knudsen, Robert Douglas, Mary Wickes,  Jerry Paris and Biff Eliot is quite good.  And the print is quite nice.",1399593600,16,755,4.659090909090909

6396261,5,B00JX3SHIC,"I got a DVD of this several years ago but when we replaced our DVD player the DVD didn't play well on the new machine. I love this movie. It is similar to Goodbye Mr. Chips. It is done in flashbacks of a school teacher who is thinking of all of her students over the years, many of who are present in her life as adults. Jennifer Jones does a good job of being a old-fashioned woman who treats people with equality and dignity and teaches values that are timeless.

6396306,5,B00JX3SHIC,"Other reviewers covered technical aspects and plot thoroughly. Today was my first viewing of ""Good Morning, Miss Dove"". The movie came on in the background, and did not get much attention until the scene with her father caught my ear.

My ear for unintentional irony/hypocrisy caused me to stop working to watch that scene. Casual hypocrisies of The Quality interest me, but subsequent cultural evolution added interest. The movie's assumptions about 'duty' and 'community' seem quaint in a vaguely disturbing way.  To acknowledge another reviewer's remarks, Miss Dove's father represents part of why Sinclair Lewis novels sold well among educated high-integrity Americans many years ago.

During the father/daughter scene it came to me the woman was Jennifer Jones.  My focus moved from work to the movie. By the time Rab, Freddy, and Bill visit Miss Dove in the hospital my thinking was ""Good Morning, Miss Dove"" represents the belief that Puritan values including self discipline and hard work are building blocks to individual Worthiness, while collective aspiration to Worthiness created the strong communities that came together to win two world wars and overcome the Depression before producing the world's first large middle class.

By the happy ending, I mourned the death of a generally agreed cultural illusion in America. The America of the movie never existed, but a clear majority supported the illusion that thrift and hard work would lead to prosperity and Worthiness. Forty-odd consecutive years of partisan presidencies have divided citizens and other voters against chimeric hoodoos while blatant political malice against citizens is ignored, and the closest approach to a national ideal seems to be getting what one can while the getting is good - and devil take the hindmost (If the government won't support them as it does corporations and Worthy individuals like me, then they must be unWorthy).

Those thoughts and the Thanksgiving season combined with time-washed memories to increase my vulnerability to revisit times and places best viewed in soft (or softer) focus. Add lack of distractions, and reflections on sixty-five years of a life much lived ran parallel to the movie's emotional triggers.

In sum, ""Good Morning, Miss Dove"" is a pleasant-if-brief respite from today's self-centered values cafeteria.",1417219200,4,2335,5.380821917808219
6396307,5,B00JX3SHIC,"One of the best movies ever made.  Ms. Dove is the definition of tough love and gains the towns respect, admiration and love for it.",1416873600,,132,4.28
6396308,5,B00JX3SHIC,"I have watched this movie many times. I finally bought my own copy. As a teacher, I can relate to the subject matter. We need more Miss Doves today.",1416700800,,148,4.137931034482759
6396309,5,B00JX3SHIC,"Jennifer Jones was a really good actor.  In this role, she ages from a young college girl to a mature elementary school teacher-spinster.  The make-up and hair job she was given is a bit harsh.  She was much prettier as she aged, but they wanted to make her look ""old"" and she is only supposed to be in her late 50s at the end of the film.

The story is one of those ""aw shucks"" tales, where the heroine faces an early tragedy and triumphs anyway.  I like that the film shows a teacher who cares and how she impacts her students' lives into their adulthood.  The film is a series of flashbacks about her career and some of her students, tied together by Miss Dove suddenly facing a life-threatening medical condition.  She then daydreams about her past life in the flashbacks.

The students get lessons on anti-semtism, class elitism, and redemption from early mistakes in life.

This film features a fine supporting cast.

6396315,5,B00JX3SHIC,"A wonderful movie from the era when there were real actors/actresses making movies.  The story line is believeable and Miss Jones does a superb job of playing the prim, no-nonsense teacher Miss Dove who in spite of her outwardly projected stern facade, cares deeply for the students she teaches throughout the years.  The character of Miss Dove reminds me of my grade school teacher Miss Thelma Jackson, who like Miss Dove, was never married, was stern but always fair and instilled a hunger for knowledge personna in almost all of us.  Wish they made more quality movies like this one today instead of pushing out the filth that seems to be the norm.  I for one am so sick of all the T&A, humping and use of the ""F"" word that it is rare I ever go to the movies anymore.  Most of today's so-called actors/actresses appear to be of the opinion that if they show their bare T&A, hump a zillion men/women and use the ""F"" word every other word they are being a ""star"".  It never ceases to amaze me that the studios always seem to be shocked when the movie going public turns out in droves to see a really nice family film or at least one that isn't made up of nearly 100% of the above filth.

6396324,5,B00JX3SHIC,"This is the kind of movie they made when it was a joy to go to the movies. GMMD is a heart warming family movie about a teacher who has devoted her life to her elementary school students, to the exclusion of marriage and personal happiness. She suddenly becomes ill while in her classroom, and while waiting for the doctor, (Robert Stack, one of her former students) she assesses her life. Jones is superb as Miss Dove, portraying her as steely firm, unemotional and yet endearing, unyielding to her personal code of ethics and behavior: ""right is right, wrong is wrong"", and known to all as ""the terrible Miss Dove"".  I read that Jones based her characterization on a nun teacher of her own while a student in a convent school. I've had some nun teachers of my own I'd like to write about, not all favorably.
Flashbacks illustrate her young students individual and present lives as a Doctor, Minister, Nurse, Policeman, famous playwright, and petty thief and jailbird (the films comic relief).

6396328,5,B00JX3SHIC,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I could watch it over and over again because it is such a feel good movie.  I usually don't like Jennifer Jones because of her face twitching and over emoting in films but the way this was written she was forced to perform it straight so to speak and she does an excellent job. I looked for this film for a long time but couldn't find it on Amazon. I finally located a copy from Movie Trade House (I believe) and it just came in a sleeve. I had been wondering what on earth I'd do if it got damaged.  So, I'm ordering this from Amazon now and thrilled that it is available;  Folks, you can watch this with your kids or your parents.  They'll all love it. LATER:  I received this copy from Amazon and while it is a better quality than the one I purchased from Movie Trade House, it takes up only part of my 60 inch t.v. screen since it is in cinemascope.  It is distracting to see the dark strip at the top and bottom of my screen.  As I said though, it is a better picture than my other copy.",1406160000,2,1040,4.014563106796117

6396330,4,B00JX3SHIC,"A daughter becomes a teacher to pay back her Father's over spending bank funds averting a scandal. When she has a serious health problem arises, the movie uses flashbacks to tell her story. She is known in town as the terrible Miss Dove but, the way she touches lives in the town makes everyone reflect and pull for her recovery.  This is a good teacher movie about how they can affect people if allowed to teach. Frankly, I like it and,recommend it.",1405814400,,450,4.487804878048781

I just hope Turner Classic Movies shows more of these in CinemaScope and I can copy them on to tape.
What a waste!  Again.....does Amazon talk to Fox?  What is there reasoning?",1404518400,2,278,4.653061224489796

6396340,5,B00JX3SHIC,As a former teacher I was able to enjoy this movie. Even though she had a stern  demeanor she still displayed a concern and care for the children she taught that had a tremendous effect on her students lives . They went on to pursue meaningful careers and had a high respect and love for her. No one could ask for a better legacy.  This is a movie for the entire family.,1403222400,3,370,4.125

How the cast referred to her as the horrible Miss Dove, but they all loved her.",1401494400,2,327,4.568965517241379

6396347,5,B00JX3SHIC,I've loved this movie for a long time.  A crime commited by her father causes Miss Dove to take a job as a teacher to repay her father's debt and to avoid a scandal.  She does her job and along the way makes a difference to the hundreds of students she teaches over the years.  This is a classic do-good story.,1401062400,2,310,4.049180327868853
6396348,3,B00JX3SHIC,"Good Morning Miss Dove is a very good movie .The print is in letterbox 4.3 and very disappointing. When  you zoom it it looses-its definition and colour,  this a real shame to see such a movie with  a bad print. For a start it needs to be remastered to its former glory. Fox you have done it again how many of us have to keep reminding this company to change there strategies and go back and produce good copies of the old classics. I am 70 years of age and I love the old movies..

6396349,5,B00JX3SHIC,"Needless to say ""Good Morning, Miss Dove"" is a superb film. My reason for writing this review is to thank Fox for not reducing this cinemascope presentation to a pan-and-scan 4:3 film like they have criminally done on other cinemascope movies under the Fox Cinema Archives banner. Although it is labelled a ""4:3 (letterbox)"" presentation a simple flick on my widescreen's ""aspect"" button and then the ""zoom 1"" button brings the full glory of cinemascope to my TV.  Fox, please, please do this for all your cinemascope films. After all, you did develop this format.",1400284800,35,564,4.936842105263158

8654365,4,B00JX3SHIC,"A decidedly wholesome, delightful, and nostalgic film. To call anything wholesome today is a kiss of death but ""to the pure all things are pure and to the defiled nothing is pure."" My one sincere regret is that the movie exhibited a complete ignorance or perverse understanding of the Gospel by which we are reconciled to our Maker and Redeemer, Jesus Christ. That is inexcusable but typically ""Hollywood"" and reveals why America is so lamentable today compared to the 1950s.",1505779200,,475,4.95
