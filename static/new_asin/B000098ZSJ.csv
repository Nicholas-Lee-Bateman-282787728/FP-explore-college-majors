1881019,3,B000098ZSJ,"A massive rock shaped as a human skull and a fierce Indian tribe guard an archeological treasure-trove in a lost valley.  Things start to pop when the Three Mesquiteers and an expedition of archeologists searching for the  treasure and a lost colleague enter the sacred Indian territory. This film  is an entertaining Grade B western that includes the familiar elements of  cliff-hanging western adventure and light humor.  The unusual blend of  western and archeology themes gives this little movie an unusual twist that  adds to its appeal.  ""The Three Mesquiteers"" was a familiar  series of the '30s and '40s.  The three saddle pals kept changing over  time, and once included John Wayne before he became a major star.  Good old  Saturday matinee stuff.

Dubs are from unrestored film stock, thus quality varies with source material condition. None are pristine, yet none are so degraded as to be unviewable. Some of their transfers are in fact quite decent.

SINISTER's 53 minute running time for RIDERS OF THE WHISTLING SKULL is five minutes less than that listed at IMDb.

The Three Mesquiteers movies were inspired by a number of William Colt MacDonald dime novels. This trio's popularity led to imitations by other studios: Range Busters, Rough Riders, Texas Rangers and lesser three-man oaters all descended from the Mesquiteers.

Although THE THREE MESQUITEERS (1936) is officially the first entry in this series, that honor technically goes to RKO's POWDERSMOKE RANGE (1935). It starred Hoot Gibson as Stony Brooke, Harry Carey as Tucson Smith and 'Big Boy' Williams as Lullaby Joslin. The actual TM series came after the creation of REPUBLIC Pictures that very same year.

Fifty-one Mesquiteer westerns were made by REPUBLIC between 1936 and '43, with the main actors never constant. Stony was played by John Wayne, Tom Tyler and Robert Livingston. Lullaby was variously Jimmie Dodd, Rufe Davis, Sid Saylor or Max Terhune, with Raymond Hatton appearing 9 times as 'Rusty' Joslin. Bob Steele and Ray Corrigan split the Tucson role almost equally. Athough the cast rotated often, one constant was a ventriloquist's dummy named Elmer Sneezewood.

7990058,3,B000098ZSJ,"This odd hybrid could only have been produced in an era which gave no credence to genre labels.  Riders of the Whistling Skull  is the kind of movie which is so delightfully in love with its period that one could easily imagine a true genre geek like Tarantino falling in love with it today.  Director Mack V. Wright is completely comfortable throwing horror, western, jungle, mystery and comic relief into a seamless mix.

The Three Mesquiteers (Bob Livingston, Ray Corrigan, and Max Terhune), for those not in the know, were the starring trio of a number of ""B"" westerns.  The well-photographed, well-paced Riders of the Whistling Skull is, by far, the best of these.  Pretty girl Betty Marsh (Mary Russell) is searching for her lost father, Professor Marsh (John Van Pelt), who, along with Professor Flaxton (C. Montague Shaw), has been kidnapped by a diabolical Indian cult.

Enter the Three Mesquiteers, who have found the injured Flaxton in the desert.  They take him to Miss Marsh.  Flaxton revives long enough to tell all that he and Professor Marsh found the lost city of Lukachukai (!) hidden deep in the region of the Whistling Skull Mountain.  Flaxton tells them of vast hidden treasures and of the unspeakable horrors of the ancient cult.  Before Flaxton can reveal the location of Lukachuka, the lights suddenly go out.  When the lights are turned back on Flaxton is discovered on the ground with a knife in his back.  Inscribed in the handle of the murder weapon is ancient Indian curse.  The mystery begins!

After a treasure map is discovered, The Mesquiteers join Betty and travel into dreaded taboo territory in order to find Professor Marsh and to uncover the identity of Flaxton's murderer.  Shortly into the expedition, one member of the party is murdered, shot by an arrow inscribed with the same ancient Indian curse as the knife.  Another member of the party, Professor Fronc (George Godfrey) is kidnapped, tortured by Indians, and tied half naked to his horse, after being branded with the brand of the ancient Indian cult of Anastasia.

Silhouetted Indians atop Coachella Valley (atmospherically shot) attack the expedition with flaming arrows shot into the wagon, which of course, demands late 30's, western-styled expert stunt work.  Betty goes missing in the ensuing chaos.  The Three Mesquiteers go out in search of her and find her in the middle of an ancient Indian cult ceremony.  Russell's tight, white shirt competes with her equally tight slacks and the even tighter jeans of our three cowboy studs for inducing the most testosterone and smoldering sex appeal.  One halfway expects King Kong to come out of nowhere and seize the heroine from the clutches of the natives, but no such luck.  Never fear, because the Mesquiteers are old hands at heroically saving virginal heroines when danger looms.

When the expedition finds Whistling Skull, they stumble upon more killer natives, secret passage ways, living mummies, and Professor Marsh.  Corrigan wins the testosterone contest when he loses his shirt, bares his chest, fights off the cult, and saves pal Livingston.  The mystery is solved when the murderer is exposed.  Luckily, the Sheriff and his band have been following from afar.  They lend a hand in dealing with the murderer, defeating the natives, and surviving a terrible avalanche, all before the neatly wrapped last line of comedy relief.

The End.

Our story line and plot, Our heroes Stony Brooke (Robert Livingston), Tucson Smith (Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan) and Lullaby Joslin (Max Terhune) members of the Three Mesquiteers ride with a band of explorers searching for Professor Marsh (John Van Pelt) an archeologist, the father of the female lead, who has discovered a lost city with hidden treasure, but who has been held by a prisoner by an Indian tribe, who has killed Marsh's partner, through a traitor amid the archeology party. Its up to the Mesquiteers to discover the villain among them and save the party from thirst and the murderous rampage of the tribe. Very enjoyable 3M film with nice emphasis of the comradery between the three friends, and also gives a nice glimpse of the style Republic used in their westerns and serials set out west --- Nice location shooting in Nevada, and a good supporting cast make this one a winner --- Mack V. Wright manages to wring every drop of excitement from Oliver Drake and Bernard McConville's colorful story, which was not so much based on William Colt McDonald, the creator of The Three Mesqueteers, as on Republic Pictures' flair for making fast-paced action serials

7990062,3,B000098ZSJ,"The Three Mesquiteers (get it?) were one of the Saturday matinee staples of the 30's, starring in more than 20 low-budget oaters never much more than 60 minutes in length. They did battle with all variety of sidewinders and banditos and claimjumpers and murderers. Crash Corrigan is perhaps the best known name to modern fans, but all three were likable types, handy with a horse and a gun.
The Mesquiteers had no time for women, and were too busy working on their ranch to drink much or smoke or swear at all. And thankfully, there are no songs here to kill the momentum. But kill people, they did, with impunity. So many villains get thrown off cliffs or shot (bloodlessly, natch) in these movies, that the body count is akin to a small war. This aspect alone keeps Riders of the Whistling Skull from being cartoon-ish in the manner of Scooby Doo, one of its closest modern ilk. Yet there is a guileless innocence to the proceedings here that renders the mayhem all in fun: the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad and deserve to die before they kill more people. (This overlooks a few un-enlightened subtexts, but roll with it, okay?)
The plot, as I hinted before, is like something from Scooby Doo, with a few more red herrings than that show typically adds. It involves the archaeological search for a mountain shaped like a skull, a map torn in pieces, and murders which may or may not be related to a legendary curse connected to the Whistling Skull. The group sets out and the murders continue. There are chases and shootouts and captures and rescues. It must've laid 'em flat in 1937.
The ""mystery"" is solved (or rather, revealed) well before the end. But there's enough action that it really doesn't matter. The rescue of the scientist's daughter from a sacrificial ceremony in a cramped grotto offers good atmosphere. Bad staging in early scenes gets markedly better later, and some shots even manage to be beautiful, especially some forced perspectives of isolated craggy peaks against wispy clouds. They do look spooky, especially in black-and-white. The print of the movie and the sound get better, too; the recurring wind howling onscreen manages to heighten the tension as was its intent. Fine Republic miniature work (a good rock slide), a couple of nice stunts (a man hangs from a fraying rope over certain death- mandatory from Republic), and one decent ""effect"" (the skull-like cave itself) add to the fun. There's even a ""mummy,"" although not in the Universal sense of the term. The manner in which our heroes defeat the evil cult behind it all is not altogether satisfying, but it's likely the production was coming to the end of its three-day shooting schedule. :-)
While a notch below the polish of Roy Rogers' King of the Cowboys, a highwater mark of juvenile westerns, Riders of the Whistling Skull still possesses a lot of old-skool charm. If you like the Lone Ranger or old cliffhanger serials, give this a try.",1059696000,6,2943,4.738791423001949
