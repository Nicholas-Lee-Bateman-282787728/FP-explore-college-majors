8309364,4,B001HQ8RM4,"Frontline consistently delivers high quality shows and has done so again with ""Heat"".  One could say the ""heat"" is on major energy suppliers to look for carbon savings (which is also frequently cost savings).  While British Petroleum (BP) had an ad campaign around 2009 for this initiative, this show reveals how far industry has yet to go.

While the show has an optimistic tone there is a serious risk of ""greenwashing"".  So, while it's nice to hear about solar and wind installations which can marginally reduce CO2, the real giant - nuclear - has yet to awaken in the early 21st century.  Maybe China will change that.  Recent WSJ articles show China has the largest number of planned nuclear power stations in the world, replacing  both carbon and toxic heavy coal power stations with nearly CO2 and mercury free nuclear power stations.  A sequel?  How about ""China's Nuclear Energy Dynasty"".",1418860800,,897,4.926666666666667

8309366,5,B001HQ8RM4,"First chapters show the various effects of global warming and climate change. Industrial growth especially in China and India is increasing by leaps and bounds, adding immensely to CO2 emissions. The United States is resistant to international agreements.
Further chapters include:
Coal.
CO2 storage.
Vehicle efficiency
Oil, including Exxon's positions
Ethanol
Alternative energies--solar and wind
Nuclear
Political will.
We must act.
Lots of political aspects shown in this film.

Of the 30 films I've seen on the subject of global warming, this is second best next to another Frontline DVD from 2000 ""Global Warming: What's Up with the Weather."" The latter is perhaps the best-rounded of the films I've seen. ""Heat"" is a bit more up-to-date especially regarding political aspects. I highly recommend both films.",1309651200,4,813,5.504
