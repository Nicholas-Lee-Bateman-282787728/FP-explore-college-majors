642459,3,6303422896,"The now almost forgotten true crime story of Leopold and Loeb, two young men convicted of murdering a boy just for the sake of killing and seeing if they were smart enough to get away with it. Leopold and Loeb were both geniuses who felt they could outsmart the law, and they employed the famed Clarence Darrow as their attorney, but even he could not save them. Swoon is a mid 1990s black and white version of the story which plays up the gay angle of their story a lot. The 1950s telling (Compulsion, starring a very young Dean Stockwell) leaves out any hint of a homosexual relationship, and really the story of the crime is told more effectively in the 50s version. Swoon is all right, and exposes an aspect of the Leopold and Loeb story we did not see in the 50s or in our high school history textbooks, but it is not the definitive film of this heinous crime.",982972800,4,865,4.345679012345679

642583,5,6303422896,"This movie followed the lives of Leopold-Loeb well and even showed the capture and murder of the young 14 year old victim, Robert ""Bobby"" Franks.",1381104000,,145,4.84
642584,3,6303422896,"Having recently acquired an interest in the subject of Leopold and Loeb, when I saw that there was a 1992 film version of their story, one which more graphically depicted their sexual relationship, I had to watch it. I'd already done some reading on the subject, including Compulsion, which is a fictionalized account as related by author Meyer Levin, and I watched the Orson Welles film, and found some books at the library on the subject as well.

Let me begin by saying that graphic depiction doesn't make everything better. The scenes between Leopold and Loeb are not overly explicit, which is fine, but I found them to be gratuitous rather than adding to anything. Granted, Compulsion did not deal with their relationship, but that isn't surprising considering the time in which it was made, namely the 1950's. But having the freedom to discuss the relationship, I found Swoon to be disappointing in that regard.

Yes, they were lovers, of that there is no doubt, but this film would have you believe that Nathan was the instigator and the ringleader, which is not the case. In one part, it focused on his fantasies of playing king to Dick's slave, but didn't mention that most of Nathan's fantasies were the reverse and featured him in the subservient role. I don't believe that the press conferences that were depicted would have been handled as the film showed them; those resembled modern press conferences more. And the boys were certainly not as open about their relationship as they are here. There is a scene where the judge clears the courtroom of all women because of the explicit nature of the testimony. I have never read about that, but I'll reserve judgment on the scene's accuracy, at least until I read Nathan's own words in his book.

The trial was certainly disappointing, and the character of Clarence Darrow as their attorney was wasted, including his dramatic closing statement that won the boys life in prison, rather than the death penalty. The death of Richard Loeb in prison was recreated, but it shows Nathan arriving after he died, when in reality, he was with Dick at the time of his death. It's little things like this that make me shake my head and ask why.

The film shows them having friends in drag, some of them black. I find this hard to believe that they ran in such circles. I feel that was done more for the tastes of modern audiences, in a sort of depiction of how the director/author saw it, rather than what was. Perhaps that also explains some of the techniques he employed, especially at the beginning, with these same strange characters seeming to glide across the screen.

The film seems to focus on their relationship as the reason for the crime, and ignores everything that was brought up regarding their Nietzschean philosophy, their feeling of being above the law. Also, their very high IQ's, and their youth. At the time of the crime, they were 17 and 18 and had already graduated from college. They were intellectual geniuses whose minds had moved far beyond their emotional development.

They changed how Bobby was picked up and murdered to make it more dramatic. They also implied that Nathan forced Dick to have sex with him in exchange for going along with Dick's criminal tendencies. Also, the film shows Nathan as coercing other prisoners for sex after Dick's death.

Perhaps if I hadn't read what I did, I wouldn't be as disappointed in the film. It wasn't badly done, just not what I expected or looked for. They're shown as exchanging rings. I have yet to come across any mention of that. Filmmaker's own idea? I don't know. Perhaps it's meant to be an objective look at these two, and I am not objective enough. Having said that,  I found little emotional content in the film. Almost as if the director was trying to create a stylized pseudo-documentary. He never lets you get a feel for the subject, though, and never truly plumbs the depth of Leopold and Loeb's intense relationship. On the whole, , I think Compulsion is a better version of the story, even if it is fictionalized, and I recommend that more than this.",1372896000,3,4086,4.7208976157082745
642585,4,6303422896,"I recently read ""The Crime of the Century"" by Hal Higdon, which was excellent.  In searching to see what movies had been made that were based on this true crime, several reviews pointed me toward this film. Other than ""Rope"", ""Compulsion"", and ""Murder by Numbers"" which are fictionalized versions only very loosely based on the events, this movie was reported to be most closely based on the true events. Real names are used throughout. Although it strays from some of the facts (Bobby Franks is kidnapped and murdered three blocks from his home in the middle of a wealthy Chicago neighborhood, not in the country near a lake), most of the things the film doesn't get right are minor. What is important here are the performances and the character development (particularly the two leads), which I thought were top-notch. This is an ""indie"" film, and its style will not appeal to everyone, but for anyone interested in the Leopold-Loeb case, this film is a must-see.",1370908800,4,965,4.848484848484849

642589,5,6303422896,"This is an amazing black and white film based on the lives of Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold Jr.. Loeb and Leopold were lovers, as well as partners in crime. The film is based on their decision to kidnapp and murder a little boy and the results of that action. This film displays how Leopold and Loeb acted as lovers, how they were discovered by the police, and how they were saved from the death penalty by their attorney's proposition.
The use of black and white makes me feel as if I am actually in the 1920's. The actors are great and they really capture the emotion roller coaster that these two men must have experienced.
I would recommend this movie to any one looking to see a great film about crime, love, and how the United States court system dealt with homosexual criminals. I am so happy that I purchased this phenomenal movie.",1348617600,,841,4.467532467532467

642591,4,6303422896,"I can't add too much about the movie concerning the script, acting, directing, etc. It's a good independent movie, with a few too many ""artsy"" flourishes, which Kalin (the director) said later were self-conscious and mainly pointless. Nevertheless, I was introduced to a wonderful indy actor, Craig Chester, so the movie is worthwhile for that alone.

My big issue is how many dvds I've had to order to get one that plays correctly. Lots of jumping and ""stuttering"" in how *THREE* of these have played. How many do  I have to order to get one that plays normally? Maybe if I order a used one, I'll be more certain of getting a copy that plays the way it should.

642633,4,6303422896,"This is a review for SWOON, a DVD release from Strand Releasing
of this 1992 film about the 1924 Leob and Leopold case concerning
the kidnapping and murder of 14-year old Bobby Franks.

As others have stated SWOON is not exactly a straight forward
telling of the crime  but more an impressionistic examination of the
lives and atmosphere surrounding the two  pre-adult
miscreants and something of a never before presentation of
how the crime happened from their own notes and confessions.

Of course this is all told in a surreal and impressionist style,
with some artistic speculation on their associates and
their mental states that led up to a ""Crime of the Century.""
This black and white film is, despite the artsy veneer, fairly graphic
in depicting the homosexual relationship between the two principals
as well as some of their party guests.

If nothing else, I would bet that SWOON is an emotionally accurate
depiction of what occured and for that it shoud be applauded.  But by
concentrating on the murderers and their fate, the victim
is somewhat forgotten, which is a shame if you ask me.

But in a way young Bobby Franks is almost incidental to these two
self obssessed college students who really seemed to believe that what
they considered to be their superior intelligence almost  gave them
the right to ccmmit the perfect crime.

SWOON does not really depict Clarance Darrow's dramatic plea for their
lives which is widely credited with keeping them from the gallows.
But it does depict their lives in prison and the fate of Dick Loeb
who did not survive his life sentence.  SWOON does show Nathan Leopold
during his long sentence and afterwords during his parole.

All and all, SWOON is a fairly satisfying character study told
in a very stylistic and somewhat sensational manner for which I
give it a four star rating.",1273622400,5,1836,4.833865814696486
642634,5,6303422896,"Start out with a true story of a shocking crime and then, add a couple of young men who thrive in the shadow enshrowded areas floating between real life and real madness.

More than simply connecting facts cronologically, this fascinating accounting of elevating violence is an in-depth study of criminal minds sinking further into depravity and madness.  Their sexual preferences are highlighted, but not essential to the development of the main characters.

The production will offend some in the audience, mainly because of dramatic changes in public morality.  The very stylized visuals are complimentary to the era represented (the 1920's) and the perceived level of ""bored sophistication.""

Not overwhelming with plot twists and/or dozens of unnecessary characters marching through the film; the story is easy to follow despite its bazarre nature.",1258329600,,853,5.480916030534351
642635,4,6303422896,"Tom Kalin's 1992 film is a landmark of what Ruby Rich famously called ""the new Queer Cinema,"" and though it's filled with flaws, it's so gorgeous and haunting that it stays with you long after you've forgotten other films that are objectively better. Like ROPE or COMPULSION before it, SWOON seems to dramatize what was known for decades as the Crime of the Century, the morder of fourteen year-old Bobby Franks by two brilliant and wealthy Chicago college students, Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, who wanted to prove they could commit the perfect crime. Other version of the story have made the homoerotic nature of the relationship between Leopold and Loeb only implied: here Kalin makes it the absolute center of the story, and the film is as much about how frustrated two beautiful and gifted young gay men are when they cannot express their sexuality openly but have the money and the leisure to do almost anything else.

Certain sequences of the film are absolutely heartstopping in their beauty, in particular the beautifully photographed opening sequence of the pair's friends photographed against a hazy sky. There's a great deal of pleasure to be had in Kalin's ingenuity in creating 1920s sets and costumes and props to make the whole thing look authentic (though his trick of using anachronistic contemporary props--such as a push-button payphone--looks to be mostly a dodge he passes off as an hommage  Derek Jarman because he couldn't figure out how to get authentic props).

The problems with the film are that in the end it's a bit empty-headed. The analogy between gay men and criminals is done in a very heavy-handed manner, particularly at the end when Kalin has a montage of photos of ""criminal types"" that are clearly all his friends in real life. Moreover, the film seems to treat Leopold and Loeb as if they were mere martyrs to homophobia; very little is made of how much Bobby Franks and his parents suffered from their crime. (Bobby is hardly seen in the film at all, and when he is he's usually not photographed directly face-on.) It's one thing for Derek Jarman to present Edward II as being martyred on account of his sexuality; but Leopold and Loeb? Despite this, I recommend seeing the film if only for its cinematography and for the excellent performance of Craig Chester as Nathaniel Leopold.",1216598400,,2327,4.871212121212121
642636,3,6303422896,"It turns out to be mediocre to everyone.

Swoon feels something like a rather lavish PBS documentary with some stylized, artsy murmuring and elaborate costumes and sets (except for the rather glaring touch-tone phones.)  As a documentary, it feels forced, and needs lots of narrative (""On July 15, we this or that and I felt this or that."") However it leaves out any attempt at an examination about why these two men behaved the way they did and what the shaping forces were that created these arrogant, outwardly-polite murderers.

As a presumably entertaining movie, it lurches from one scene to another and lacks congruity and basics of story-telling (like a beginning or an end.)  It is interesting, and there are glimmers of excellence, but mostly they get drowned out by costumes and smoking and narrative.

Worth seeing, but not entirely successful.",1115769600,4,856,5.042553191489362
642637,4,6303422896,"This film takes a look at the leopold/loeb case that is often glossed over in other films and even books on the subject. The focus is obviously on Leopold and Loeb rather than the crime itslef and the importance their personalities play in their connection to each other. The film seems rushed at times but it just seems to add to the intensity of it all. It's rushed but you can't seem to think of it being any other way. You're not left thinking one of the two boys is any more 'evil' than the other (which is perhaps the best thing about the film).
However, if you're not familar with the leopold/loeb case much of the movie could potentially be confusing and while many of the lines are actual things said by the two boys they are often placed in a different context or said to different people. If you've previously read Hal Higdon's book on the subject the movie makes much more sense than it would otherwise. However, if you have not, it is still a disturbing yet touching story. You'll realize the complicated nature of the boys' relationship and question who really contributed to the crime.",1059177600,7,1100,4.532663316582915
642638,5,6303422896,"This is a great film. Its prospective is very different from the two previous films(Rope/Compulsion) made on the Leopold/Loeb case. These other movies were both highly fictionalized versions of the case. This film is considered the most historically accurate to be made so far on the case, the trial scenes were taken directly from the actual trial transcripts. For this reason the film is often shown in Criminal Justice, Law and History classes.
This movie is also the first to boldly examine the homosexual relationship between the two killers.
Actors Daniel Schlachet (Loeb) and Craig Chester (Leopold) do an excellent job in the very diificult roles of two child killers.",1028073600,7,676,5.154545454545454
642639,3,6303422896,"In my 11th grade English class, we were given a study on the case of Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold, two college students who came from well-to-do families, who committed a most gruesome act of murder against a small boy by the name of Bobby Franks. The question throughout our studies: why would two well-off young men, with everything going for them, do such a thing to ruin their futures?
Tom Kalin's ""Swoon"" answers that question in gritty detail, using an unrelenting style that is admirable but brings little emotion to the film's central story. Told in black and white, with small bits of narration cast into the sequence of events, the movie provides us a look we've never seen before at the duo, one that is intriguing at times, though becomes tedious and dismal in others.
Daring in its approach to reveal the truth behind the scandal, Kalin's script goes into the relationship of Loeb and Leopold, whose sexual relationship with one another serves as the drive for their crimes and grievances against others. Their murder of the Franks child, to them, was little more than a promise kept by Loeb to Leopold, while to the rest of the community, it was a sheer act of horror for which, everyone hoped, they would pay with their lives.
But this new theory that becomes the center of the story is never quite full of the energy it needs to make it more engrossing. There is a certain amount of gratification with the exploration of the relationship between the two; in one scene, Leopold tells a shrink of a slave/master fantasy, which describes his views of his relationship with Loeb. The two find themselves together not out of want, but out of a need for one another, which makes for some very twisted yet intriguing mind games between the two.
The way the material is handled creates a problem: there's no energy to it. Throughout the second half of the film, primarily after their arrest and imprisonment, the movie loses what little momentum it had reserved, settling into stages of boredom without becoming absurd or redundant. The black and white photography is in the film's favor, placing us in Chicago during the mid-20's with an authenticity that accentuates the time and setting. Actors Daniel Schlachet (Loeb) and Craig Chester (Leopold) are convincing in their portrayal of Loeb and Leopold as emotionless, and without remorse for the crime.
So what is it about ""Swoon"" that keeps it from being a first-rate film? I just don't know. Here is a film that borderlines on greatness, boasting a daring story with style and acting to boot, and yet it never seems to cross the line into something interesting. It doesn't have the spark needed to make the story worth getting into; there's no emotional drive or connectivity, which allows us to get into the plot only so much before we start wondering what we should be feeling for it.",1006646400,27,2851,4.761616161616161
642640,4,6303422896,"I was really impressed by the quality of this film, particularly considering its budget. Good black and white shooting is nearly  lost in my opinion but apparently the photographer of this one had studied his Earnie Haller and Leni Refenstahl.  I also found it highly ironic that in this retelling of the story that Leopold and Loebe escaped death due to a lack of understanding of homosexuality. They were declared mentally deficient by virtue of phrenology and old freudian neurosis. Had the establishment of the 20's understood homosexuality, Leopold and Loeb would surely have hanged, for they were guilty as can be.  I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this film was.  When it came out, any film with a gay theme got a good review so I have avoided the late 80's and early 90's gay movies.  This film was quite the exception.

7846402,4,6303422896,"I saw this movie when it first came out.  I was on a date with a man who thought it would be an interesting film for a male couple to see and he was right.  Recently, I ran into the title at a video rental store and decided to watch again, over the distance of 22 years, to see what I'd think of it now.

The film was much as I remembered it.  Though it plays fast and loose with the facts and takes quite a few liberties here and there, it is still worth watching.  The first twenty minutes are my favoritethe ""honeymoon"" phase of Leopold and Loeb's affair.  They make a charming and believable couple and one finds himself hoping they'll live happily ever after together.

Of course, if you know your history, you know this wasn't the case.  Although in real life Loeb was probably the best ""husband"" a guy ever had (loyal, enduring, protective, hot), the two get caught and serve brutal sentences for their crime of murder.

This version of their story brands itself as the only film explicitly addressing the sexual relationship between the two men.  However, one gets the feeling that the writer/director was torn as to how the film should be handledas titillating exploitation or another docu-drama about a famous crime.  This ambiguity levens both aspects, especially the eroticism of their affair.  Also taming the sex scenes is the fact that the man playing Loeb was in real life heterosexual, significantly limiting how far he was willing to go with his male co-star.

These are small complaints however.  Overall this is a good film and worth having in your collection.  Recommended.",1421712000,,1594,4.663082437275985
