1329015,3,B00003CXLD,"The in-crowd is a fine movie, with a beautiful cast and a melrose place plot. It does not mean it is boring--not at all! In this movie,a girl(Adrien) leaves a mental institution to work in a summer club, with lots of rich and clueless teens. Despite the fact she is an employee, she soon gets involved with those people, going to parties, hanging out with rich girls, etc. She meets Brittany, a rich and snobish girl who becomes her friend, and who does everything to get what she wants. This movie is really similar to ""wild things"", with kevin bacon and neve campbell, and makes you laugh, without huge expectations.
Susan ward is incredible. She is naive, but at the same time extremaly dangerous and evil!",976752000,,709,4.634920634920635
1329016,1,B00003CXLD,"I was dragged into this movie by friends and knew it would behorrible. The plot was worse than most daytime soap operas and theacting was less than par. It is obvious this movie was made for noother reason then to appeal to a teenage audiance. Random sex acts forno reason, a terribly unconvincing plot and actors who look good butcan't act for their lives.  Never before have I seen such a terriblefilm.....",976579200,3,408,4.666666666666667

The basic plot is that a girl get out of mental ward gets  a job and is benfriended by the delicous Susan Ward. When the new girl crosses Susan's chracter there's hell to pay. If this film had been rated R, had some nudity then it would did better at the box office but I liked it though....",975801600,,393,4.038461538461538
1329018,5,B00003CXLD,"As much as I would love to hate this movie, I honestly can say that I don't.  In fact, I really enjoyed it.  ""The In Crowd"" is not an Oscar contender, it is not the most deep and insightful movie of the year, and it is certainly not the most realistic portrayal of teenage life today.  But, what is important, and what made me enjoy it, was the fact that they took it quite light heartedly and made it fun.  It wasn't made to win an award-it was made to entertain (and Hollywood has become more ""award orientated"" lately, it is not about the entertainment anymore) and that is exactly what it does.  If you are in the mood for a good, teen thriller with beautiful people with lots of money, then check it out.  It's fun!",974246400,2,720,4.218978102189781
1329058,3,B00003CXLD,"You've seen it all before: Very attractive 20 somethings at a snooty country resort that has a very dark underbelly.  Enter a recently released mental patient (played by Lori Heuring) who is given a job there thanks to the influence of her caring doctor. She is quickly exposed to the ""Queen Bee"" of the ""In Crowd"" (deliciously played by Susan Ward) who takes a particular shine to her, takes her under her wing, and makes LH her new BFF.  Cattiness, jealously, snobbishness, and general nastiness suddenly rear their ugly heads. However, nothing is as it seems or appears (big surprise). SW is too nice to LH and too beautiful to be what she is; others begin to issue warnings about SW but are initially disregarded to the ultimate regret of too many. LH looks like SW's long lost sister who does send an occasional post card to SW telling her that everything is OK.  But is LH perhaps the actual ""missing"" sister?  And why did LH wind up in a mental institution (a brief explanation doesn't carry much weight) in the first place? Why is one of SW's ""in crowd"" best friends afraid to retrieve a golf ball from a particular area just beyond the golf course?  How does one gain entry into a doctor's office in a private institution and then gain access to files in what should be a locked cabinet in the doctor's unlocked office door?  How come every key conversation is overheard by someone who shouldn't hear it?  Why am I asking these silly questions? We've all seen variations on the particular theme of this movie done in a far better and more credible way.  But, like unhealthy comfort food, it's worth watching just to see how this version handles itself.  There's also plenty of ""eye candy"" from both genders to help move things along.  Given the fact that all of the actors were at least 15 years younger than they are now is interesting just from a visual standpoint.  Matthew Settle (of ""Gossip Girl"" fame), who plays a tennis instructor, is particularly noteworthy as is the actor who plays LH's doctor (he of ""Hardcastle & McCormick""). As The In Crowd moves towards its inevitable and predictable conclusion, the general tempo picks up and is certainly attention grabbing.  However, the ""grand finale"" - more like an Epilogue - is disappointing in its triteness; and unless the writer and producers of this film had foolish high hopes of a ""Sequel"" was definitely unnecessary and only served to take the shine off of whatever positives the ending might have had.",1434326400,,2474,4.701388888888889

1329101,2,B00003CXLD,"This is a pretty boring attempt at suspense.  Let me ask you a question.  Do you like the overdramatic teenage/young adult concept of popular TV shows such as Beverly Hills 90210 and the OC?  Because that's EXACTLY what kind of suspense the In Crowd is centered around.  Some might call it poor acting- I just call it an undeveloped, misleading concept.

Young women in college (many of whom are quite beautiful which is probably the only reason I'm not giving the film a 1-star rating) walking around the property having typical conversations and living the typical lifestyle that most people that age prefer to live but... we're supposed to find this overdone concept suspenseful in some way, which is where the fault entirely lies.

In the very beginning a girl gets released from a mental hospital and her ""friend"" says ""You'll never make it out there!  They'll see what you're really like!""  This leads one to believe the woman being released has a sick, twisted side to her character but... instead, she's actually VERY normal and it's the *other* girls she meets at her new home/workplace that have the psychological issues (well, one of them at least).

For the first hour, there's really no mystery or anything out of the ordinary that would lead one to believe there's something wrong with anybody or anything taking place.  Just young college girls acting normal and participating in normal activities and relationships.  It's awful.  It's misleading too.

I recommend skipping it because you won't find any suspense, interesting characterization or storyline development here.  Only near the end when a girl gets murdered in a cheesy hard to believe way do we experience any excitement. Skip it.",1321056000,,1707,4.985865724381625

1329103,4,B00003CXLD,"It's a fairly average ""thriller"" but for me, Susan Ward makes the movie.  I really wish the US version had the full nudity in it.  I also wish Susan would've gotten enough fame to STAR in more movies.  She had a cute part in Shallow Hal but it was a small part.  To me she should be in league with Megan Fox who doesn't make Jennifer's Body near as interesting as Susan makes this movie.  At least that's my opinion.",1277164800,,416,4.15
1329104,5,B00003CXLD,This was always an indie favorite of mine. I suggest this to anyone with an open mind and a cheesy love of party indie films.,1258588800,,125,4.04
1329105,3,B00003CXLD,"Recently released from a mental institution, a hot blonde named Adrien (Lori Heuring) gets set up with demeaning job at a posh country club full of aimless trust-fund teens in the mold of Paris Hilton.  All the gorgeous kids are led by seductive socialite Brittany (Susan Ward), whose decadent lifestyle, beautiful but sycophantic friends, and mysterious past has turned her heart as black as charcoal.  Prompted by Brittany's inexplicable initial friendliness (BFFs), Adrien ingratiates herself into the gorgeous group, and get used to the glamorous lifestyle.  It's a great setup, but eventually the cast's beauty must step aside for a plot.

Why was Adrien in a loony bin?  Who cares, she looks great in that dress!
What's up with the other rich kids?  Um, did you see the blonde bulging out of that pink bikini!?
Why is Brittany so inviting with Adrien?  OH EM GEE!  They are both in a clearly frigid pool!

Eventually, dark pasts uncover ridiculous revelations that tie the putrid plot together similar to a 4-year old attempting a Windsor knot.  This movie is perfect for a teen crowd (not me), or someone who enjoys the FACT that Susan Ward's exposes her breasts more than once, and they steal the show (me).  For the most part, the problem with the drama is that it's equally impossible for any viewer to look beyond the boobs to believe Ward is scary or Heuring is powerful.

It's essentially somewhere between Dawson's Creek and Melrose place, not as innocent as the former, and about as catty as the latter.  Aside from the casting director, this movie doesn't deserve any awards; it's just about hyper-sexual, incredible looking, early twenty-somethings parading around the beach in swimsuits, and attending swank parties.  It's a guilty pleasure movie carried by the casts' looks - which is fine by me.",1241481600,4,1815,4.947194719471947
1329106,5,B00003CXLD,Product just as described... love this movie even though it's such a B movie. Great for rainy days!,1234137600,,99,4.555555555555555
1329107,2,B00003CXLD,"I remember when this movie was first released and I was just dying to see it.  I was young and stupid and it looked cool.  Well, I never got around to seeing it in the theater and by the time it was released on DVD I wasn't too interested in seeing it.  Then I saw it in a bargain bin at like Walmart or something and so I bought it thinking that it couldn't be all that bad.  I was wrong.  Well, okay honestly it's not the worst movie ever made for I sure have seem much worse, but it's nothing worth watching really.  There are so many things wrong with this movie, so many things that make it any of the following adjectives:

Stupid, boring, predictable, ridiculous, annoying, irritating, confusing, pointless...

I'm sure there are many more that I could add to this list but I'll refrain at the moment.  The thing is that this could have been more than B-Grade movie fluff but it fails to really elevate itself.  It borrows everything that was unique about countless films yet it doesn't do any of it justice.  In the end it reminds me of a `serious' episode of `Dawson's Creek' or something like that.  The tension the film tries to create in scenes is non-existent and the atmosphere of `party-all-the-time, isn't-this-cool' just doesn't really fulfill.  It's really just a film filled to the brim with clich&eacute;d characters, over-dramatized plot twists that really aren't that dramatic and an ending that fails to really deliver on the goods.

The film follows Adrien, a disturbed young girl who needs to move away and start over fresh, get her past behind her.  When she moves to a country club to work she becomes infiltrated into a group of spoiled bratty rich kids whose queen Brittany takes a personal liking to Adrien.  Brittany is not all she seems either for her past may be even darker than Adrien's.

It's not that `The In Crowd' didn't have somewhere to go, it just goes somewhere it shouldn't have.  The revelations of both girls `pasts' are a bit misplaced.  One is way over the top and the other is actually much less impressive and creative then I had imagined.  The film seems more interested in making this as teen-attractive as possible with overt sexuality, borderline lesbianism, weird party scenes and a club scene that fails to really deliver anything titillating.  In the end they slack off on the script and character development for nudity and amateur sleuthing (I'm not complaining about the Susan Ward boob scene, it really was the highlight of the film).

The directing, editing and most importantly the lighting of the film is atrocious.  In one night scene on the beach in particular it's downright impossible to see what is going on.  Like I said, the film is nothing more than an extended episode of `Dawson's Creek' or `Saved By The Bell' even, so please don't watch with high expectations.  In the end I'm sure there is some enjoyment to be found in `The In Crowd' but nothing substantial enough to really warrant watching the film at all, unless you count Ward's nudity as substantial enjoyment, which I guess technically it could be.",1191974400,,3082,4.673469387755102
1329118,5,B00003CXLD,"This saga of catfights between gorgeous rich bitches--none of who seem to own a bra--is almost a documentary of how to make an awful movie. With its scantily-clad babes, lurid lesbian come-ons and innuendo-laden lines like ""Didn't mean to get you all wet,"" The In Crowd aspires to Showgirls levels of camp, but while the cast of that much-adored stripper opus did nothing but act, the denizens of The In Crowd couldn't act their way out of a Ziploc.

Susan Ward (straight from her masterful work on NBC's canceled ""Sunset Beach"") stars as Brittany, the teen queen of a hoity-toity summer resort. Lori Heuring is reformed psycho Adrien, who becomes a cabana girl at Ward's decadent hot spot. Ward takes Heuring under her wing, and soon, Bad Things start to happen. Is any of it believable? Only if you think bisexual teen seductresses exist in the real world. (See WILD THINGS and CRUEL INTENTIONS for further examination of this epidemic.)

Not surprisingly, the whole feminist nightmare was conceived by two men, who, while writing, must have had one hand on the computer and one hand on something else. Meanwhile, Mary Lambert directs as if she is still making Madonna videos: transparently gay actors are cast as womanizers, Ward's lip-gloss plays a supporting role and everyone else seems to have been hired on the basis of how they look in a swimsuit. Politicians will also note how sex, drugs and booze abound in this PG-13 movie totally aimed at teens. Offensive? Nah, just laughably inane. Kudos to Ward, who gleefully dives into her low-rent Basic Instinct-predator role, even if she is woefully ill-equipped to carry it off.

For the DVD lovers out there, there is a hilariously knowing, self-deprecating commentary by Ward and Heuring (who are now our two favorite people in the world) as well as deleted scenes and interviews with the cast (one of whom is clearly on drugs).

It would seem that Warner Bros. studio executives (circa 2000) would most likely rather die than release an edgy, thought-provoking film. Thankfully, they bankrolled this steller Bad Movies laugh-a-thon, which, justifiably, didn't make a plug nickel.

For lovers of unintentional camp and Bad Movies We Love, THE IN CROWD is a must see. A worthy addition alongside such modern day misfires as THE TEMP, THE CRUSH, SINGLE WHITE FEMALE and BASIC INSTINCT 2. All others should stay far away.",1188777600,,2376,4.9448621553884715
1329119,1,B00003CXLD,"It's surprising that this movie actually got a theatrical release. ""The In Crowd"" feels like a sub-par straight to video movie. It feels like the filmmakers couldn't decide whether to make a drama or a thriller. It ends up being neither. The drama parts are uninteresting, the ""thrills"" don't come until the last ten minutes and by then you've already lost all interest in the movie. The pace is sleep inducing. I'm sorry I wasted my time and I was glad when it was over. Don't waste your time and definately don't waste your money on it.",1175644800,,538,4.556701030927835
1329120,2,B00003CXLD,"If this film had bi-passed the theater then I may have better things to say about it, for in a B-grade, straight to video kinda way this is a decent thriller, but in the made for the cinema, big budget slasher in the vein of `I Know What you Did Last Summer' meets `Cruel Intentions' it fails miserably.

The first downside would be the cast of relative unknowns, the only real `star' in whatever sense of the word you want to use it is Susan Ward (of Soap Opera fame).  It's not that a cast of unknowns is always a bad thing, sometimes it can help propel the careers of the cast (like in the case of Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell & Cole Houser from `Pitch Black') or it can really help keep the focus of the viewers attention on the meat of the material (as in this years `United 93'), but in this case the material was weak and the cast is still careerless to say the least.

The second downside is that important piece of the pie called a plot.  The film opens with Adrien (Lori Heuring) being released from a mental institution.  For some strange reason they, as some sort of punishment, send her to work at this ritzy summer beach resort where she meets the popular kids, all followers of the queen-bee Brittany (Susan Ward), so despite her being warned she falls into their little circle.

The plot falls to pieces when they shift what could have been a primo baddie roll in the hands of the mental girl and give the sinister role to Brittany she socialite.  The problem here is that her reasons for being so evil are completely ridiculous and unbelievable and strip the script of an ounce of eeriness.

Yes Susan Ward is hot but she is far from scary here, in fact in the end when Adrien is running scared from Brittany I'm forced to laugh.  The plot tends to contradict itself a lot, one minute Brittany and Adrien are friends, the next their not, and Brittany never really comes off as trying to do anything bad until all of a sudden she flips, as if for no reason, and the film falls apart fast after that.

It could have been a much better movie had the script really been tweaked, but tweaked it was not so good this is not.  Like I said, if your into B-grade (or maybe even C-grade) teen thrillers then this serves up enough hot flesh and pointless acting to satisfy, but if you want something smart and the slightest bit engaging then pass this trash up for something better, please.  As a side note too, the lighting is terrible in a few scenes here, particularly on the beach at night.  You can hardly see anyone or anything its so bad.",1165968000,,2549,4.341052631578948

I like those teen slasher movies like SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, but this one was too weird and bizarre for my tastes. It was very well photographed and sometimes well directed, but the script and actors are very lame and really don't deliver anything special.
It's the story of a former mental patient, Adrien, who is sent to work at a hip country club. She is soon involved in a wicked friendship with the sexy Brittany, who sees the image of someone else in Adrien, and therefore begins to act as her loyal companion. Through investigation and patience, Adrien finds that Brittany is nothing but an evil murderress.

Director Mary Lambert, best known for PET SEMATARY and its lame sequel strikes out again with this lousy waste of celluloid  which could be described as [Insert title of any low grade teen slasher] crossed with [Insert title of any lousy Aaron Spelling soap]. This time around the hijinks are set at a Country Club catering to the rich and vacant, populated by attractive women with personality minus and permanent PMS, and dumb guys with their brains located somewhere in their swimming trunks. Of course, one of them is a former mental patient so it doesn't take a genius to guess what happens next. [play PSYCHO theme]
TH IN CROWD did have the potential to be an enjoyably trashy movie, but it severely misses the mark. There's only one lousy murder in the first 20 minutes and given the sizable cast of moronic characters, this basically keeps the mayhem quotient low. Dreadful in all departments.

1329149,3,B00003CXLD,"This movie is soo stupid, it is funny.  The actors are lifeless and the plot is predictable.  I don't really get who was crazy here, the Susan Ward character or the blond chick or maybe the producer for flushing so much money down the toliet.  And how was she in?  She killed someone to be in, as in what?  I had to give it 3 stars because I laughed so much during the movie.  Other than that, it is total garbage.",1020643200,,414,4.049382716049383
1329150,5,B00003CXLD,"Take a step into a modern day melodrama as you slowly speed through a glitzy look at the rich and popular aspects to life.
Adrien Williams has recently been released from a mental institution and introduced into a whole new world by the lovely Brittany Foster whose attention is only on the gorgeous Tennis pro Matt Curtis.  After enjoying the first while of her fresh new start Adrien eventually learns that rubbing it up with the rich and popular isn't as glamorous as it first starts out to be, when Adrien's new best friend Brittany evidently reveals a whole new side to her that could destroy Adrien's new found freedom forever.
Susan Ward plays a fantastic role, if you thought Sarah Michelle Geller was nasty in Cruel Intentions you haven't seen nothing yet!
I would recommend this movie to all teenagers and young adults.",1016582400,,829,4.756944444444445
1329151,3,B00003CXLD,"This complicated teen movie doesn't know whether it's trying to be a satire or a horror, so it plumps for somewhere in between.  It starts with ex-mental patient Adrien getting a job at a trendy sports facility, catering for a load of rich snobs and drunken fools.  At the head of this `in crowd' is Brittany, a beautiful brunette with a dark past who rapidly accepts Adrien into their group.  Before Adrien knows it she's in the midst of fancy parties wearing expensive dresses and is wanted by all the handsome boys.
The central idea of a group of people who struggle against each other in a seemingly endless search for power is intriguing but hardly new.  Brittany rules her clique with an iron rod, using sex as a weapon to get what she wants.  This blatant excuse to have excessive nudity is thankfully handled tongue-in-cheek, which is an altogether wiser approach given the movie's `made for TV' look.  By far the most promising idea is that social rejection is the worst punishment that could be doled out to these kids, with staring eyes and accusing faces represented as infinitely worse than being locked up in an insane asylum.  Also it's nice to have a heroine that isn't exactly perfect herself.  That said, `Heathers' was a much wittier, funnier take on the social structure in a high school and is something that `The In Crowd' just can't compete with.  Yet this is moderately entertaining, with a storming finale that involves prom queens in exquisite dresses chasing each other in high heels, with one carrying a heavy spade over her shoulder.  Oh, and you might recognise Tom as the guy that played Percy in `Buffy The Vampire Slayer'.",1013558400,,1655,4.735191637630662
1329152,4,B00003CXLD,"On a Sunday morning, in my PJ's with nothing else but old men sermonizing on tv---this movie is alright.  Okay, Okay....I swore that I was only going to finish the movie since I'd already invested half an hour into it.  Then, today, and it was on again.  I was drawn.  Upon my second viewing and although I must stress it's no great suspense thriller--still entertaining.  Okay, okay I liked the gratuitous lesbianism (bisexuality) in the movie.  The plot could have been prettier but it's not entirely guessable.  At least in the beginning it's not clear who the antagonist/protagonist is. Good hook.  Oy, so 4 stars.  Cool.",1010793600,,625,4.820754716981132

1329155,2,B00003CXLD,"Aside from a few attractive ""actors/actresses"" -- and I use these terms lightly, this film has little to offer.  The acting was terrible, the plot was okay, but needed alot of work!!! There were holes in it.
This is a cheap ripoff of ""Wild things"".  They even went so far as to have a Denise Richards ripoff who was trying to hard to be Jason Vorhees.
Don't waste your money, at least wait for it on HBO if you really are curious about it.",1002672000,,439,4.214285714285714
1329156,3,B00003CXLD,"While most reviews for The In Crowd tend to be negative, I actually praise it.  It's not anywhere near original, but it's still a fun, smart joyride.
The setting revolves around the Cliffmont Country Club.  Everything seems to be perfect there.  The characters are rich and beautiful with promising futures ahead.  They have everything that they could possibly want.  But below the surface level lies a web of deceit, jealousy, and envy.  Some of them hide terrible, dark secrets, and they will do anything to keep them from getting out and ruining their reputation.  Soon, some of those secrets begin unraveling in a terrifying and twisted suspense thriller.
While The In Crowd isn't exceptionally great, it's not anywhere near bad either.  All of the acting is well done, especially by Susan Ward and Lori Heuring.  The DVD contains plenty of extras and the picture and sound quality are excellent.
In conclusion, The In Crowd is a good film packed with many surprising twists and turns.  Do you have what it takes to be in The In Crowd?",1001203200,,1039,4.8192090395480225

1329160,1,B00003CXLD,"I didn't like this movie and I am not going to spend a lot of time on an in depth review.  But in summary:
-  the cast is beautiful and they keep hinting that you are going to get to see a lot of them acting very naughty ... but it never happens
-  the plot / mystery never develops
-  the acting is wooden and the dialog is uninspired, just what you would expect from a group of brand new actors

1329161,1,B00003CXLD,"Like the equally terrible film ""the skulls"" this is another in a long series of teen movies that try to be sexy like ""cruel intentions"" but merely come off laughable and cheesy.
The film plays out like a soap opera, full of pregnant looks, beautiful clothes and bodies, but little substance. The ""in crowd"" itself is composed of really underdeveloped characters, and not an African American in sight.
Brittany Foster is just not that compelling, nor are her rich and shallow friends. The body count is really low, and your interest level will follow suit quickly.",981158400,3,563,4.875

Well, the movie didn't exactly light any fires at the box office, so the supporters of this ""entertainment"" are in the minority.
The main blonde girl vaguely reminded me of a young Sarah Jessica Parker.  The main brunette looked like a blandly attractive hybrid of Tiffany Amber Thiessen and Denise Richards.  The psychiatrist reminded me of Ron Perlman.  What's the point of me saying all this?

""I told you, you'd kill in that dress"". LOL!!! Corny, campy, and a joke of a movie. The only reason anyone would watch this if for the sex appeal and looks it has to offer. Susan Ward plays a great villain though. Matthew Settle (Gossip Girl Dad) is boring as usual and the rest are nobody's. First off, don't pay full price for this: you will regret it and just end up sending it back. The plot is so dull, you'd get more action watching a season finale of Beverly Hills 90210. This film doesn't even even compare to Melrose Place! Melrose is ten times better in one episode! Story: Girl gets out of a psych ward, gets a chance at a beach resort, given a chance with skanks and male models, makes plastic, fake, trashy friends who are all drunks and on drugs, they set her up and it all blows up in her face just for wanting to be part of the ""In-Crowd"". Some great fight scenes, a few tense moments, but honestly...NO. Just NO. Horrible. Awful. Just no. It's great for a one time watch, but I'm glad I rented this when it was released on VHS!
