8714667,5,B00WZSOZFQ,"Cronenberg is the intellectual transformer of film. He utilises film fiction to write dissertations on technology and the electronic media in reshaping our identities. He has said he wants to see what happens when people go to extremes and alter their total environment to the point where it alters their physical selves. TV can change your mind; Videodrome will change your reality. Cronenbergs stories are largely imagistic/symbolic, visceral/cerebral, exploring the organic/inorganic interface. Max Renn ( James Wood) is looking for fresh new content for his TV channel, when he comes across some illegal S& M-style broadcasts called Videodrome. Embroiling his girlfriend, Nicki (Debby Harry), in his search for the source, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy as he works his way through sado-masochistic games, shady organisations and body transformations. Brian OBlivion, a media guru ( modelled on Marshall McLuhan) is shown on TV/video all the time espousing the films philosophy: Your reality is already half video-hallucination. If you're not careful it will become total hallucination. Youll have to live in a very strange, new world.. The Videodrome signal will cause a new outgrowth in the brain. The TV screen has become the new retina of the minds eye. TV is reality and reality is less than TV. Anyone exposed to the Videodrome signal gets sucked into a never-ending hallucination controlled by someone elses will. Whoever it goes into goes into it: it can bend the subjects perceptions so drastically that the body itself alters form; its flesh melts into globs, sprouts machine parts, splits apart for use as a storage area. You can even patch a video into the persons brain by inserting a cassette in his stomach. He can be programmed to kill, and he does. His girlfriend Nicki who is shown on TV waiting to be whipped by him(who is standing outside the TV) asks him to open the neural floodgates by whipping her, which he proceeds to do. We have already seen her flesh burned with cigarettes or pierced with needles. Here people seem to merge with their electronic media. Bianca OBlivion (Sonja Smits), says that the Videodrome signal can be run through any television transmission, even a test pattern, and not only via the torture-and-snuff subterranean TV program Videodrome, which Max Renn (James Woods), programmer of cable access Channel 83, has been shown by the stations satellite-bootleg expert, Harlan (Peter Dvorsky). Violent sexual imagery is just most efficient for opening the neural networks and making viewers receptive. But even the Home Shopping Network will do the trick. Watching TV will alter consciousness. The more exposure, the more permanent the state of hallucination becomes.

Videodrome shows contestants chained to a muddy-looking electric wall and we are told are strangled at the end of their torture session. However the most disturbing images show Maxs stomach being turned into a vaginal slot: into this, fascistic Videodrome conspirator Barry Convex (Les Carlson), inserts a pulsating, breathing video; the same cavity grips Harlans wrist and rips his hand off, his arm emerges fused into a grenade after Bianca OBlivion has reprogrammed Max to wage war against Videodrome, to accomplish the triumph of the  new flesh. Another gun as an outgrowth of his arm shoots cancerous tumours into Barry Convex, who is shot by Max on the stage of one of his own shows. Nicki tells Max she is going to Pittsburgh where the pirate broadcasts come from, even though he doesnt want her to. Max next sees Nicki come to him from a broadcast by Brian OBlivion after a hooded figure straps him into his chair and strangles him. The hood is removed to reveal Nicki. Her lips fill the screen as she purrs Come to me. Max leans his face into the enveloping, undulating screen. Max hallucinates all the time after exposure to the signal and Convex asks him to allow him to record his hallucinations with a high-tech helmet, the Accumicon, which seems to glow. The great centre-piece of the surrealistic imagery is a large cabined TV set whose wood and frame moves and undulates,which has a life of its own, with veins in. Max is seen to whip this,which leaves the person being tortured on its screen, screaming(changing from Nicki to Masha). Its all one. When he wakes, Masha is lying next to him dead. When he asks Harlan to check, shes no longer there. There are religious ideas behind this: Max is told by Bianca he is the video word made flesh. Death to Videodrome. Long live the new flesh. To become the new flesh, you must first kill the old flesh. Max is deprogrammed by a TV screen pushing out into the environment and shooting bullets into his body.

Videodrome is the definitive statement of Cronenbergs cosmology. A complex, labyrinthine, many layered, puzzle. James Wood captures the obsessive,addictive, sleezy, personality of Max, whose fascination leads to his corruption. OBlivion( Jack Creely) , the Frankenstein/mad scientist, meets his end as a result of his own creation. The uncontrolled spiral of Maxs mind becomes the very fabric of the film. Bianca(Sonja Smits) is the cool, intellectual woman(mind) , and Nicki(harry) is the sexually aggressive woman(body). Convex exists in a physical world of power and control. Cronenberg emphasises narrative subjectivity because Max is the absolute focus,  a person coming into contact with very dark, scary parts of himself and what happens to him while confronting them. We only knowwhat Max knows. Reality cannot be trusted because perception cannot be trusted. After his exposure to Videodrome does the narrative continue in his mind? If not, does he attain a new plain and become the  new flesh? We get a succession of  hallucinatory surfaces reflecting elusive, shifting realities. The film is full of bizarre organisations,Spectacular Optic, Cathode Ray Mission etc. to which the individual is at the mercy of. The medium may be the message, but its sub signal (subtext) is also the disease. The Cathode Ray Missions aim is to patch social derelicts back into the worlds mixing board by means of TV. Cronenbergs ability to unite mise en scene and narrative to create a powerful emotional bomb is special, as well as his cool,detached manner when dealing with the most out-there material. He taps the unconscious, dream, fantasy, nightmare:  my films really work on dream logic. I like narrative that seems to make sense, and then, suddenly, it doesnt. The rich orange/brown colour scheme is highly body conscious and denotes danger. Repetition of colours and objects evokes mood. Special colours dominate the drab, gloomy, normal world of neutral greys and pastels. Objects from earlier scenes reappear in Maxs hallucinations. Maxs apartment is full of TV metaphors: glass panels, multiple screens, the bluish hue of the lighting and horizontal blinds. The clatter of the d&eacute;cor represents his disordered mind. Downbeat locations strip away the veneer of social respectability,adding to the dread of Maxs downward spiral. In this truly visionary film Cronenberg admits he was breaking new ground. Howard Shoreselectronic score is sensual,unsettling, profound. Debby Harry shows what the public lost when she devoted herself to music. Cronenbergs masterpiece, devastating,one of the 80s best films.",1493510400,,7316,5.168776371308017
