7626617,2,B01BD5M2U6,"Too cute for its own good! Not enough story and trying too hard to be indie! Hey, I love indies but just not this one;)",1455580800,,119,3.8

8749871,3,B01BD5M2U6,"The characters were too naive to really like. The inserting of 'nudity' was totally unnecessary. It was like the filmmakers thought by adding nudity film fests would respect the movie more.
Just got to saw, Always making the woman go nude in a film is so anti-women. It sends the Message: Women are ultimately only sexual objects. So wrong. Maddening!",1458172800,,351,4.866666666666666
8749872,5,B01BD5M2U6,"I'm not positive how long it is, but it's about 90 minutes. It's an independent movie based on Dostoevsky's novella White Nights. Wait. What? A comedy based on dark and heavy Russian lit? Yes. Amin Matalqa found humor, a lot of it, in the novella, and put together one of the truly funniest movies I've seen in years. The cast was marvelous  none of whom I was familiar with, and all of whom were fantastic! Blind Nastenka is in love with Steve, a missionary in Africa. Fyo is in love with Nastenka. Steve is in love with Steve. I seldom watch comedy, and even less seldom watch romance, so for me to recommend a romantic comedy, well, pay attention!",1457481600,,650,4.46218487394958
8749873,5,B01BD5M2U6,"Enjoyabe, fairytalesque....good acting....the anorexic female lead.....eeewwww.  Really don't enjoy looking at women who have bones protruding out the chest wall and shoulders.....just gross and really distrubing to look at.....ruined an otherwise enjoyable movie for me.  Maybe we could all agree to stop modeling this as ok in the film/media industry in general?!",1457049600,,365,6.0
