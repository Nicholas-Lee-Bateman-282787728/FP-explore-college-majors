It's not a cure, I mean if you stop doing it the effect fades, but if you keep with it you'll see a big difference in your skin, and it's a pleasant, soothing routine, very nurturing..

I purchased this in hopes I had found the fountain of youth, at least for my face.  Ah, but all is vanity! Fortunately I only paid $1.00 for this at the local library's sale and that was too much.

Well, they never mentioned their ages, so perhaps in reality they are hot looking 60 and 70 year olds, ha!

Well, I'm no health expert, but I think if you boil it all down, taking care of your skin comes to consuming the best quality food you can afford (or grow), drinking lots of good quality water, good sleep and exercise, 30+ sunblock, laughter and an attitude of thankfulness.",1223942400,4,784,4.492957746478873
