679082,3,6303560121,"If you're willing to overlook the holes in the plot, this is a fascinating film that shows just what a great actress Lombard was. The scenes in which innocent Roma is possessed by the spirit of the dead female murderer is the best thing about the film. Here Lombard is allowed to do a feminine ""Dr Jekyll and Ms. Hyde"" transformation with nothing more than a little dark eyeshadow, deeper baritone voice and sharp glances. Though physically she looks different from the killer (possibly based on a real-life 1930s murderess), her body language is totally dead-on with the earlier actress' moves and the conversion is totally convincing. This is a great pre-code film that shows Lombard's range, which sadly, she wasn't allowed to do much outside of comedy.",1230595200,6,756,4.9140625
679083,4,6303560121,"All about sances and spirit revenge, and not nearly as bad as it could've been. Spititualist Alan Dinehart will do anything to get his hands on Carole Lombard's money, including murder. Vivienne Osborne plays a woman about to be executed (she's called the ""Greenwich Village murderess""), and she allows H.B. Warner, a doctor who believes a dead criminal's spirit can enter another's body and continue its criminal ways, to experiment on her after her execution. Osborne's spirit enters Lombard's body, and having taken over Osborne's personality, Lombard is able to expose and get revenge on the murdering and scheming Dinehart. Some of the special effects are pretty crude (it's 1933, don't forget) and the spiritualism stuff is fairly hokey, but Carole Lombard is exciting to watch as she changes from a decent woman into a vicious criminal once Osborne's spirit enters her.",1149379200,6,876,5.176056338028169
679084,1,6303560121,"I bought this film because of Carol Lombard and the enthusiastic reviews I read on Amazon.com.  In fact, this film is a turkey, a laughable attempt by Paramount to emulate the genuine thrillers being produced at the same time by Warner Brothers.  ""Supernatural"" is so corny, implausible, and so ineptly put together that your teenagers will laugh you out of the house should you be caught watching it.  Poor Lombard, pretending to be a haunted killer whose powerful hands can strangle men.  Poor Scott, forced to read lines (and wear a suit coat obviously to short for him) that would make a high school thespian blush.  No wonder there are plenty of copies available at low, low cost.  Anyone with an ounce of sophistication would want to discard this film as quickly as possible.",1093305600,9,781,4.791044776119403
679085,4,6303560121,"""Supernatural"" is still available as a videotape because it stars Carole Lombard, but you will appreciate it more if you focus more on director Victor Halperin, whose previous film had been ""White Zombie.""  We begin with the slimy Paul Bavian (Alan Dinehart), a fake spirtualist who wants to get his hands on the Courtney family fortune.  Towards that end he tells young Roma Courtney (Lombard) that he is in communication with her dead brother, John (Lyman Williams).  Bavian arranges a seance using his landlay, Madame Gourjan (Beryle Mercer) and uses a mask of John's face to convince Roma that her brother, reaching out from beyond the grave and tries to convince her that John was murdered by Robert Hammond (William Farnum), Roma's legal guardian.  Of course, Roma is upset by this news and does not know what to do.
Meanwhile, in another part of town, we meet Dr. Houston (H. B. Warner), a psychologist who believes that the spirits of dead criminals can enter the bodies of the living and continue to commit crimes.  To prove his theory, the doctor has made arrangements with Ruth Rogen, the ""Greenwich Village love-murderess"" who is about to be executed for the murder of three of her lovers, to perform experiments on her body when she is dead.  Ruth has agreed because she wants to take revenge from beyond the grave on Bavian, who is the one who betrayed her to the police.
Now, if you understand the first part of the plot and accept the second part, then you can get a good idea of how this one is going to end.  The biggest problem with ""Supernatural"" is achieveing a willing suspension of disbelief, but if you can get past that this is a nice little thriller in the tradition most of us would recognize as being akin to the ""Inner Sactum"" radio show or E.C. Comic's ""Tales from the Crypt.""  If you were never in to such nonsense I can see where this one will strike you as stupid, and fans of Lombard the comedien will find nothing here of value, but in the context of 1930s horror movies, ""Supernatural"" is not that bad.  This 1933 film is only a bit over an hour long, so it moves pretty quickly all things considered.  The special effects are hokey, but, again, by the standard of the time it is still above average.",1076457600,13,2236,4.5814536340852134
679086,4,6303560121,"Independent producers Victor and Edward Halperin are best known for ""White Zombie,"" the 1932 horror classic that features one of Bela Lugosi's finest performances. However, the Halperins' 1933 follow-up,  ""Supernatural,"" is a must-see. Running only 64 minutes, this  imaginative thriller boasts a memorable cast and some stunning visual  touches. From a stylistic and thematic standpoint, ""Supernatural""  is quite similar to ""White Zombie""  right down to the memorable  close-ups of Carole Lombard's eyes and the inventive use of  superimpositions. Since the Halperins received backing from Paramount,  ""Supernatural"" is a more polished production than ""White  Zombie,"" though it lacks the stature of the Lugosi film.  Thanks to  MCA Home Video, this underrated chiller has been rescued from obscurity.  ""Supernatural"" is a minor classic of the genre.",957916800,34,851,5.774193548387097
7850000,4,6303560121,"Clocking in at 65 minutes, this obscure film is more like a short story -- but a very good, quite effective short story that's drenched in dark, even sleazy atmosphere & creepiness. As usual in such horror stories, the villains are the real attraction -- from the homicidal murderess who won't let something as inconvenient as death in the electric chair stop her from getting her revenge -- to the fake medium who betrayed her & doesn't believe in the supernatural at all until it's much too late -- to his drunken landlady scheming to get in on his latest scam -- and even to the noted psychologist who seems to have a screw or two loose himself. As for the leads, Carole Lombard is quite good, especially in her transformation from sweet, grieving sister to possessed she-devil. Poor Randolph Scott, alas, is relegated to looking handsome & worried in evening clothes -- but that was usually the fate of the male romantic lead in such films.

The look of the film is wonderful, all swirling fog & ramshackle buildings, with the dazzling offices & estate & yacht of the millionaires providing vivid contrast. Films of the early 1930s were a lot more willing to get down & dirty, suggesting far more than we saw on the screen -- and that comes through here, with enough shown to heat up the imaginations of the viewers even more. And isn't that the fake medium's hand directly on Carole Lombard's breast in the seduction scene? Of course, he think's that's he's in control of the situation, when it's actually the other way around ... but see for yourself!

It's no lost masterpiece, but it grabs hold of you from the start & doesn't let go until the end -- recommended!",1460419200,,1671,4.604026845637584

7850002,5,6303560121,"Underrated horror film from the classic era.  The close-ups of Lombard's eyes while she is possessed are very creepy.  I really do not understand this film's obscurity.

7850004,5,6303560121,"This film has languished in obscurity for decades as part of the horror films that Paramount released back in the 1930's, however it's good to finally be able to see it. There are a few macabre and strange twists in this early story of spirit possession and it must have given viewers a shiver back in the day. Good cast and nice print make this a wonderful edition.",1430870400,,366,4.397058823529412

7850006,4,6303560121,"I originally owned this on VHS and received the DVD version recently. Apparently Universal is taking Warner Bros.  lead and releasing some of their more obscure or older titles for film fans.
Having seen this previously, I would probably not have purchased this for myself if Carole Lombard were not in it. I have been trying to get here entire catalog movies on DVD. Needless to say, I consider this an opportunity.
The plot is fairly simple. A fake psychic (Alan Dinehart) is busily scamming Roma (Lombard) with promises of putting her in touch with her recently deceased brother. Complicating matters is Dinehart's attempt to place the murder on Roma's guardian. To complicate matters, a female mass murderer is being executed and the Dinehart character wants to experiment with her remains. Given that the entire film is a big 64 minutes. You can clearly see or intuit that something is going to go awry before the 64 minutes reach its predictable end.
While Lombard is clearly miscast in this B thriller, she forages on to a predictable ending.
The real charm or more likely 1932 new technical innovations are some cool special effects which include having wild killer eyes superimposed over Lombard's orbs. Not exactly high tech today, but definitely it was fun back in the day.
The reason this was given 4* is the special effects, moody tone and overall creepy vibe not to mention Lombard taking a rare departure from comedy. I enjoyed the film and forgot the plot was sort of simple",1423353600,,1490,4.8431372549019605

7850008,4,6303560121,"Bought this mainly for the very early Lombard performance.  Surprisingly, not a bad stab at the supernatural!!  Unfortunately, Even though in the female lead, Lombard's input is minimal.  The other drawback is the actor used as the psychic...totally wrong casting!!  Also, a bit expensive for what is offered.",1421193600,,309,5.375
7850009,4,6303560121,A rarely seen thriller and a good one. I'm so delighted that Universal is finally taking a nod from Warner Archive and starting to dig into the treasure trove of worthwhile films that haven't seen the light of day in decades. Kudos!,1417651200,2,232,4.5476190476190474
