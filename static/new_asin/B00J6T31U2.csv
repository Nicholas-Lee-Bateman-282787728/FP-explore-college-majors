8648571,5,B00J6T31U2,"Awesome! My husband and I completely enjoyed this great DVD! If you are a Duck fan, I think you will love it, and I think it would also be a great video to show to church groups, youth groups or to just share with friends or family. For the affordable price, it sure was worth every penny and more! Such a blessing to get to hear Phil share how he shares his faith in Christ! Love the Robertsons for that!!!",1455408000,,407,4.1
