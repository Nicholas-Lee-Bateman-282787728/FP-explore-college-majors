8518618,3,B007K4X0F6,I really like Jason Statham as an actor; but this set of DVD movies was not what I expected. There is way too much foul language and lots of nudity and sex. I read the movies descriptions and of course they don't state the strong foolness.,1516060800,,239,4.217391304347826
8518619,3,B007K4X0F6,"Received the set and it's great except Crank 2 was defective and would not Play and after trying several attempts and different ways to get it to play, when it did open up there was a 4"" x 4"" picture so small you could not see the movie. I contacted Amazon and they gave me some money back and i re-ordered it with amazon through another venue and after 3 weeks when that one FINALLY came it was defective as well with the same problem.  So now it sits on the back seat of my car as I wonder what to do with it now ??  Sucks,,,",1490832000,,527,3.9158878504672896
8518620,5,B007K4X0F6,"Five action flicks starring Jason Statham in one collection...can't beat that.  I thought The Mechanic was the best of the crop, in fact I purchased this set after getting and really enjoying the Mechanic II on DVD.  War and Transporter 3 were good action movies with great script, plot and action.  Crank and especially Crank 2 were a bit over the top.  I didn't know what to expect with these movies and was amazed.  They were both very entertaining with humor mixed with lots of blood and guts.  Made my head spin trying to follow the action.  I definitely recommend this collection for anyone seeking fast, high-octane entertainment.",1487635200,5,637,4.842592592592593
