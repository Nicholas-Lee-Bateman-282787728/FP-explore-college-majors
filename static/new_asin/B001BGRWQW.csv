3491983,1,B001BGRWQW,"ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE SEEN, I THINK THE WRITER MEANT WELL BUT IT HAS LOUSY ACTING(IF YOU CAN CALL IT THAT), EXPLICIT SEX SCENES THAT WERE TO LONG AND EVEN WORSE ACTED THAN THE NON SEX SCENES.  I HAD TO FAST FOREWARD THRU MOST OF IT.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS LIKE I DID...IT'S 95 MINUTES  OF YOUR LIFE YOU'LL NEVER GET BACK.  By the way.....This movie was filmed in my family's  city of origin which I have not been to in a few years. The only good thing about the movie was seeing landmarks and the mountains that surround the city.",1326412800,,556,4.111111111111111
3491984,5,B001BGRWQW,"Very little dialogue here.  Interesting concept to let the pictures do the talking.  Granted it's an easy plot, but the music is delightful and Senorita Castaneda is mesmerizing.  This is a feelgood movie, decidedly ""graphic R nasty"" with probably a bit too much graphic sex--but that is the reality of existence for the characters in the film.  A basic need, well portrayed in this underappreciated effort.

The message for the rest of us with a better lot in life:  enjoy the moment.  Nothing more; nothing less.",1287100800,,514,4.906976744186046
3491985,5,B001BGRWQW,"What a marvelous little movie this is.  I watched a version with no English subtitles, and yet understood every word and scene in the movie clearly - not only due to the fact that there is very little dialogue, but also because the filmmakers have done such a great job of storytelling with such an interesting, minimalist plot and human characters.  The scenery of the film, in the poor and middle class neighborhoods of Monterrey, Mexico, the vibrant Cumbia music soundtrack, and the young good-looking actors all make it impossible to take your eyes and ears off this movie for a minute.

I immediately fell in love with this film from the very first second that Nito's video camera focused on the striking leading lady (girl), to the film's last scene complete with its ""have your cake and eat it too"" ending.  More than anything else, this movie proves the point once again that Hollywood can throw hundreds of millions of dollars into making films that are ultimately unwatchable, but they could still stand to learn something from a picture like this where a small shoestring budget can create a masterpiece if it has the key elements of good storytelling, fresh young actors, colorful locations, energetic music, and archetype characters that speak the universal language of love.

Those who are lucky enough to stumble upon this movie will be happy they did. I sure hope we get to see more of these actors somewhere else down the road.",1266883200,,1444,4.806451612903226
3491986,4,B001BGRWQW,"Not much in the way of dialogue in this film. It's sort of like a musical, Latin-style. The girl is some nice eye candy, very sexy. It's a love triangle between a girl and two guys. A lot of nudity and sex, but tastefully, passionately done. The movie was really very well done from a cinematic standpoint. Set in Monterrey, Mexico.",1249430400,9,332,4.459016393442623
3491987,4,B001BGRWQW,"I saw this movie on cable TV.
And like the other reviewers pointed out, the plot is very simple but compelling which kept me from turning the channel. It's a love triangle involving a man/woman couple and another man who is captivated by the woman. That woman is Fernanda Garcia Castaneda. She is not your classic beauty but she has tremendous sex appeal and it shows well on screen.
There is very little dialogue but you really don't need to understand their Spanish language because it's obvious what the actors are talking about. The English sub-titles came in handy with the music lyrics. You'll be hearing music throughout the film. I thought it was well done.",1241222400,2,665,4.741379310344827
3491988,5,B001BGRWQW,"It is a simple but fascinating movie. The actors are so real and true to their roles. The young lady (Cory) sexy and captivating. The music fit the movie and it is the dressing in the movie. You must see this movie, specially if you speak spanish.",1238716800,2,247,4.276595744680851
3491989,4,B001BGRWQW,"Like the other reviewer, I too just saw this movie on ""cable"".  I couldn't find anything else to watch and so decided to try this.  I'm very glad I did.

This is a simple movie. It centers around a love triangle involving two young men and a young lady.

Basically, boy ""B"" is a videographer that stumbles onto the couple of boy ""A"" and the girl.  He is immediately captivated by the girl and falls in love with her. He ""stalks"" her, films her and loves her from afar even though he can see she is involved with boy ""A"". Finally he makes contact and she responds to his advances. She is flattered by his advances but still cares for boy ""B"".

The female lead is not beautiful (compared to Salma Hayek)however she is captivating.  It is easy to see how boy ""B"" falls for her the first second he sees her.  She is fascinated by boy ""B"" who is the sensitive, caring, ""all attention"" paying type which is totally opposite of boy ""A"" who is a macho male that thinks first with his emotions and hands and almost never his head.

She has a decision to make but she really wants to have it both ways.

I really didn't thrill to the music but enjoyed the movie anyway. Unless you speak better spanish that I do, you'll have to live with the subtitles but it's okay. Dialogue is minimal.

The female lead makes the movie believable. She doesn't just captivate boy ""B"", she'll captivate you.  You will easily understand why boy ""B"" is so hopelessly under her spell.

So watch this movie. Enjoy the ending.

Note to the prudish: there is a fair amount of nudity and graphic sex.",1237939200,15,1566,4.355172413793103
3491990,5,B001BGRWQW,"I saw this on HBO a few weeks ago and just totally loved it. The story is simple and actors great (the girl's very appealing) But the music is the greatest! I had never heard of Cumbia anything until I watched that movie. My usual music is far from that...but I am hooked. If you like foreign movies and like something entertaining don't miss Cumbia Callera!
One thing- the subtitles are yellow. My complaint is only eyestrain",1224892800,20,426,4.545454545454546

8283180,5,B001BGRWQW,Great indie film. Just a simple little story making a lot out of a little. Music is great.,1487635200,,90,4.055555555555555
8283181,1,B001BGRWQW,"The video quality is good but the film ending is cut. In other words, it ends abruptly. It seems as if it was not finished. The film production itself has a few very distracting continuity issues. We found ourselves laughing at segments that were meant to be serious. Since it has no talking parts or narration you must pay attention to the nonverbal cues and music lyrics to comprehend part of the storyline. Being fluent in Spanish helps.  We are. The nude scenes are first-year high school film student amateur light porn productions. This film is not difficult to watch but it is a less than stellar story. How it won a prize is beyond me. I would suggest alcohol desensitizing before you watch it.",1482969600,,702,4.616
8283182,5,B001BGRWQW,Love this movie,1458259200,,15,4.333333333333333
8283183,1,B001BGRWQW,I received this movie a while back. Didn't get to watch it until recently.  It's a good movie but I'm dissatisfied with the product. It seems like it had been open through a thin slit on top.  The dvd is scratched and skips/stops throughout the movie. Annoying!  This film is hard to find. :(,1457308800,,292,4.37037037037037
8283184,4,B001BGRWQW,"Interesting chronicle of people who are trying to figure out who they are, how to love life and how to love each other.
One cute girl two lucky guys.

8283186,5,B001BGRWQW,No words in the entire story....good but repettive music...worked for me...Like to watch it every year or so...Not a mainstream type movie...go into it flexible....has a voyeristic aspect to it.,1387324800,,194,5.5
8283187,5,B001BGRWQW,this movie is very good....speccyali when you and your girlfrend are alone at home i reccommend this type of movie,1377129600,,114,4.75
8283188,2,B001BGRWQW,"Let me start by saying, the only reason why this movie got two star,  is bcz the music was great... Celso pina music was part of the movie.. or I should say, was the whole movie. No talking happens in this movie.. no talking... Only a guy following a girl around with his video camara .. will not recommend movie at all..very disappointed...",1377129600,,341,4.412698412698413
