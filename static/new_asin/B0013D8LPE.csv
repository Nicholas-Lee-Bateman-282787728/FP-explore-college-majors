3103960,5,B0013D8LPE,"I'll keep this review brief;  there is simply not alot for me to say, as music like this speaks for itself.  You will be hard-pressed to find another group of musicians who both look and sound so joyous in performance.  Everyone in this group is as much a music-lover as they are a music-player.  Smiles and laughs abound amongst the bandmates, and at times their improvisations sound more mirthful and giddy than the musicians themselves, and that's saying alot!  If this performance doesn't bring a smile to your face, I fear you're beyond hope.
Add to this a wonderful feature-length interview with Messrs. McLaughlin & Hussain, documenting the history of this groundbreaking band, as well as classic clips of performances by the original Shakti (and even one of the 1st Mahavishnu Orchestra!) and you have a DVD package that's worth twice it's price.  5 stars +++",1246147200,8,867,4.904109589041096

8250168,5,B0013D8LPE,"I saw Shakti when they performed in Mannheim, West Germany in 1977. Their energy and musicianship just blew me away. This DVD tells the story with interviews, and video clips of John, Zakir, and others of how the band was formed and how they evolved. It was fascinating to hear that CBS just could not find a market for their recordings. Their re-formation as Remember Shakti brings back all of the electricity I experienced when I saw them the first time. The breadth and depth of John McLaughlin's musical talents is absolutely stunning. To top that off, both Zakir and John emerge as two very articulate individuals who can talk evocatively about their music as well as being able can play the hell out of their instruments. Five stars.",1398902400,,739,4.736434108527132
8250169,4,B0013D8LPE,I loved the DVD. But the last Concert on the had terrible sound at very low sound levels. My amp was at peak output and sound was at very low level.,1355702400,,148,3.806451612903226
8250170,5,B0013D8LPE,"John McLaughlin should be rewared by Indian government for the promotion of this Asian Power culture by ""Shakti"" and other projects which brought us closer to that music and became classic of the fusion of Western instruments and style of playing with Eastern expression of the music",1323302400,,283,5.042553191489362
8250171,4,B0013D8LPE,"For example the Montreux one (the one in 1976) is absolutely great. They filmed just one song, ""Joy"", that  features naturally John McLaughlin and Zakir Hussain (the two founding members of Shakti) on Guitar and Tabla, and L. Sankar rocking the hell out of his violin, and T.H. ""Vikku"" Vinaykram on the gatham, a percussion similar to a giant jar. This performance is particularly powerful, all the musicans are in great form!
 The same thing about two of the three songs on the more recent (John hair was white) ""Live at Bombey"" performance. The first one, for example, is great: it's called ""Giriraj Sudha"" and it features V. Selvaganesh on various percussions, Shankar Mahavadenon the voice (a very strong point on this song), A. K. Pallanivel on the tavil, another indian percussion, John, Zakir and the phenomenal mandolin player U. Shrinvas that wrote the song as well. The melody and the rhythm of this song is so frenetic, and even if John doesn't play a lot on it, the mandolin is still great
 The weak point of this performance is of course the next song: ""Shringar"", featuring Shiv Kumar Sharma on the santur, a strange string instrument played with sticks. This song consist in a boring quarter-hour santur solo. Then percussions start to play, and it becomes more interesting. Only when John touches his strings the song touches the apex, but the rest of it is absolutely boring.
 The best song on this performance is the last one: ""Bell'alla"", written by Zakir (the tabla player), that features also Bhattacharya, an incredible slide guitar player (the slide guitar is not the classic occidental one, but  the indian one, that sounds like a sitar) and Sivamani, a drums player, probably with jazz influences.
 Debashish's slide guitar and John's Gibson solos are incredible, so great and inventive. No one can beat them. The percussions solos are great too.
 The next video is of another Montreux show, but this time dated 2004.
 It featured John, Zakir, Shrinvas, Selvaganesh and Mahadaven, but it's quite boring: John guitar uses the same effect all the song long, and the singer says the same sentence during 10 minutes! So this performance is really poor.
 So, as I said before, on this DVD there are good ones and bad ones: you just have to choose the right for you.
 Anyway, the biggest difference between the old performances and the new ones, (in my opinion) is that while the olds were the ""meeting point"" between indian and jazz music, the new ones are like indian music with a jazz guitar player, like a stranger. Maybe they forgot what was Shakti about in 70's, or maybe it's just me...",1288483200,6,2612,4.810267857142857
8250172,4,B0013D8LPE,"While at first this may seem ""out there"" if you just let go of ""your idea"" of what music is, your mind/body will soak it up like a sponge. It is so amazing what talented musicians can do...and being able to see them perform plus being able to see all the different instruments makes this a truly enjoyable experience.",1260748800,,317,4.389830508474576
8250173,5,B0013D8LPE,"I've been following McLaughlin since the mid 1970s, but I've never before gotten such an in-depth presentation about this underappreciated group.

Musically, you get both old Shakti and new Shakti; in my opinion, every iteration of this group has produced some of the most vital and inspiring music on the planet. The sound quality is surprisingly good, even on the 1970s material - it's almost as good as on the Columbia Shakti releases. The video quality's at best OK on the older material, but what can you expect?

The interviews section goes into great depth - and told me much I didn't know - about how Shakti originally came together, how it reformed, and how it came to so gracefully combine various aspects of Indian and Western music. I learned much about Indian music in the process. One of my favorite moments is a brief tabla solo by Hussain, which shows both his extraordinary skill and the incredible range of his seemingly simple percussion instrument.

I rented this off Netflix but I'm buying a copy.",1257120000,,1018,4.805714285714286
