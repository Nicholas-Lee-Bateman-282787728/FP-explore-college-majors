7869051,5,6304366132,"I watched all The Saint series on tv recently, but this and Vendetta were Saint movies that didn't air with the series.  I loved Roger Moore so much as Simon Templar that I had to get the films.  This was a fun movie with a James Bondish theme.  And I never get tired of looking at the extremely handsome Roger Moore.  This was only available on VHS, but I grew up with VHS as the first medium for movies to rent.  The tape worked beautifully.",1426809600,,443,4.1647058823529415
7869052,3,6304366132,"The Fiction Makers (ITV, 1967) - Roger Moore stars as the Saint in this very entertaining feature cobbled together from a two part episode of the long running TV series. After attending the newest superspy ""Charles Lake"" movie with the film's female lead, Simon Templar is called in to a meeting with reclusive author Amos Kline, creator of the Charles Lake books. Simon is delighted when Amos turns out to be cute-as-a-bug Sylvia Syms. He's less delighted when a band of nutters who style themselves after Charles Lake's archenemy group S.W.O.R.D. and their diabolical leader Warlock kidnap them to press the inventive Kline into planning the perfect heist from the impregnable Hermetico, Inc. What makes this so much fun is that the whole thing is a send up of James Bond (more the books, only a little of the movies, but still...) six years before Roger Moore took over the role. Highly recommended, also starring Nicholas Smith (Mr. Rumboldt himself!) and Philip Locke (Vargas from Thunderball!)",1290470400,,999,5.024096385542169
7869053,3,6304366132,"""The Fiction Makers"" originally was a two part episode from ""The Saint"" TV program, later packaged as a feature.  By 1968, the series was winding down.  Most of the original Saint stories had been adapted for the program, and the writers had been creating new original adventures for the character for some time.  By then, most of the Saint's hard edge was gone, and what was left was just a shell, at times almost a cartoon character, especially in the hands of screenwriter John Kruse.  There has always been an undertone of humor to the Saint, but here much too much is just played for laughs.  For fans of the original Saint found in literature or even from the early days of the TV program, it is sad to see the decline of a once proud character.
That said, this comic book adventure, written by Kruse, features Roger Moore as Simon Templar, AKA ""The Saint"".  ""Amos Klein"" is the reclusive author of James Bond type spy adventures.  When a deluded band of crooks seek to make Klein's fictional world a reality, the Saint finds himself kidnapped, and mistaken for the famous author.  The real Klein is actually a woman (Sylvia Syms), who is imprisoned with the Saint in a country manor.  There, the gang plot the their upcoming caper, the robbery of a facility where valuables are stored.  All that is needed to insure their success is the expertise and guidance from their creator (Klein).  The Saint plays along with the deception until he can turn the tables on the gang and foil their criminal plans.
This is strictly lightweight entertainment.  Fun, if your expectations are low.  Production values are TV quality.  Edwin Astley's main title music is good, and the opening credits are amusing.  This adventure will be part of an up coming DVD boxed set of The Saint TV program, so if you are interested you may want to look there for it.  If you are a fan of the Saint, you may want to see my other reviews of the DVD boxed sets of this program.",1019433600,3,1954,4.555873925501433
7869054,4,6304366132,"While most remember Moore as Ian Fleming's super spy, James Bond, Moore was playing The Saint while Sean Connery hit the big screen as 007. This film was originally broadcast as a 2 part episode during the TV series. Then it saw release as a motion picture in several countries. Author & creator, Leslie Charteris, actually re-wrote the screen play into a novel by the same name in 1968.
Roger Moore's rendition of Simon Templar (The Saint) became the most famous. His tongue and cheek style was perfect for television (although he was never as ruthless as he was in the books).
In The Fiction Makers, Templar is hired by a publisher to protect his best selling authour, Amos Kline. Kline's books are a direct spoof of Fleming and Charteris' own stories, and the opening scene depicts Moore at a movie premiere poking fun of how predictable the ""007-like"" character was (how ironic).
Kline and Templar get kidnapped by S.W.O.R.D. (Secret World Organization for Retribution & Destruction) a take off on Fleming's ""Spectre"" organization and must write a plan for S.W.O.R.D. to break into the world's strongest bank (how very Goldfinger-esque...)
The film flows very well, with plenty of humour and Moore's perpetual raised eyebrow wit. A perfect addition for fans of the TV series, or fans of Moore in general. Great 60's spy soundtrack courtesy of Edwin Astley. My only complaint is that we only see Templar's car (his famous white Volvo 1800) for a few minutes.
The VHS transfer is excellent and the sound and picture quality are first rate.  A steal at the price.",989971200,3,1564,4.857677902621723
