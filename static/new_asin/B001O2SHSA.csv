The film is a comedy targeted at families and kids, it's a story of a high school baseball pitcher who's life is kind of exploding in his face.  His father, who left him when he was ten, suddenly has showed up in his life again and wants to be forgiven, but Robbie is too angry at him.  There's a lot of good baseball action, Robbie is an amazing pitcher, but his temper causes him a lot of problems on the field.  Then there's the girl situation-- he screws up a good friendship for a shot with the school's popular pretty-girl.  Then he fights with his best friend.  He has a crisis of faith as he hits the bottom, then can only pull himself out of it with God's help and a moment of providential clarity.
