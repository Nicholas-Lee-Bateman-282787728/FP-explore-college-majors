7795694,3,0975546112,"I had looked for additional information on Sgt Basilone after driving on the road at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton.  A very informative and nice documentary of one of the many hero's of WWII.  If you are expecting lots of video clips, then you will be disappointed.  Lots of photo's of Sgt Basilone.",1199664000,3,302,4.660377358490566
