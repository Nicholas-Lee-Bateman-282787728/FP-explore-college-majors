8188737,4,B000P3N8WO,"Easy Street is a solid documentary that both makes the viewer feel for the homeless while also explaining why it is so difficult to solve the homeless problem. The filmmakers chose to focus on several homeless people in St. Petersburg, Florida. Viewers watch these people struggle and cheer for them to succeed. There are a number of surprising plot twists.

One thing that I liked about the film is that it avoided the tendency to search for easy answers. There are many organizations that attempt to help St. Petersburg's homeless, but the five homeless people in Easy Street struggle to better their lives for a number of reasons: mental illness, substance abuse, and poor decisions - among other reasons.

Easy Street isn't an uplifting documentary, but it is interesting.",1306972800,,776,5.007751937984496
8188738,4,B000P3N8WO,"Over a one year period, the lives of 5 homeless people (and a few others here and there) are put under the microscope in St. Petersburg, Florida.  During this time frame, Patrick, G.W., Karl, Jaime, and Peg share their thoughts and experiences about survival on the streets.  As strange as it might seem to most people, there is an agreement by a few here that they enjoy being homeless in St. Petersburg in part because they seem to be decently cared for, to a degree.  That is to say that there are many volunteers and organizations that feed and offer help to the homeless, maybe even more so than many other cities.

Nevertheless, all times are not good times as evidenced by their stories of harassment by the public, inability to find employment, dealing with law enforcement, lack of money and shelter, and struggling with inner demons in the form of alcoholism, depression, substance abuse, and mental illnesses, among other things.  Whether it is hard luck stories or being victims of circumstance, homelessness touches many walks of life.  This is a varied group of individuals consisting of the young and old, some that previously had good jobs, those from broken relationships, prior criminals, and even military veterans.

Becoming a functioning member of society, by those living on the streets, is examined here also.  There are sometimes convincing and not so convincing arguments about why homeless people don't or can't find work.  Furthermore, there is the question of responsible use of money made either through panhandling or small day to day jobs that are occasionally found.  One thought that seems to stand out more than others is, how is it that there is money to buy alcohol and cigarettes but never any money for food or shelter?  This doesn't apply to everyone as it is shown in the program that some overcome hardship and they make a determined effort to find work and better themselves.

`Easy Street', as the title implies for this documentary, is anything but easy in a very real sense.  Even though some of the material here is sobering and gloomy at times, there are inspirational moments at certain points that demonstrate people can overcome adversity against all odds and it balances out in the end.  The subject matter is comprehensive in scope so that there isn't a one sided slant raging against the homeless but also not completely defending them either.",1183420800,,2396,4.898514851485149
