7966928,1,B00006BSDC,"first off ""a death at love house"" IS NOT,REPEAT IS NOT in this set.if you are looking for it you can find it in other collections,maybe even with ""souls"".

  dominique and tormented are just to bad for even ""so bad it's funny"" really!!!!

  skip this and look elsewhere for your ghost thrills",1146182400,4,292,4.519230769230769
7966929,1,B00006BSDC,"Price aside this disk is not worth  putting in the time to view it. The other 2 reviews (obviously submitted by the same person) liked Death at Love House,,,unfortunately this movie is not one of the ones on the disc. Dominique is just barely passable and considering the names involved almost a shock,,did they need the money that badly?? Tormented is by far the worst,,pure drawn out crap slow moving poor acting,,a waste!! Carnival has some derivative zombi walks and even jazz zombi dancing but it just cant cut it,,three poor excuses for a ghost genre dvd,,Mine is trashed already.",1138924800,5,586,4.86
