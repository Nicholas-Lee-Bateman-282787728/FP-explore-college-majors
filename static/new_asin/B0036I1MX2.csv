4077745,5,B0036I1MX2,"This is a great movie to give a person who is curious about the raw lifestyle an idea of what it is like and what to expect. Jenna is fun and lively. It is one of those films where you enjoy it so much, that it is over before you know it.",1266796800,16,238,3.5961538461538463
4077746,5,B0036I1MX2,"Great documentary! Filled with amazing information and so true to life. Plus, Jenna is cute, funny, and a real person on a real journey. So inspiring! Makes me want to grab a big salad and be good to my body. :) I've had more than a couple 'movie nights' to share this with friends. Everyone loves it.",1266796800,17,301,4.298245614035087
4077747,5,B0036I1MX2,Very inspiring - a way of life that everyday people can embrace! Beautifully done by Jenna Norwood.,1266796800,5,99,4.882352941176471
4077748,5,B0036I1MX2,Jenna is irresistible ~ this is an important journey the whole world needs to witness.,1266364800,7,86,4.8
4077749,5,B0036I1MX2,"Bravo to Jenna Norwood, who illuminates the other side of ""Super Size Me"".  1000% more inspiring, professionally done, awesome story.  Must see!!!",1266192000,4,146,5.590909090909091
4077750,1,B0036I1MX2,Originally friend bought this for me for 24 dollars now wow 59 dollars for an amateur DVD-Are you for real? Who is this lady? She is not famous and has no medical credentials.,1323129600,,175,4.333333333333333
4077751,3,B0036I1MX2,"This is a very cute film and she did a good job of directing and editing, however it did not convert me to raw.  I was convinced raw is good for health, but not enough to go that route.
Of course the service from Amazon was great, arrived well packaged, promptly, in good condition.",1318204800,3,282,4.222222222222222
4077752,5,B0036I1MX2,I was so excited to watch this documentary!  I would love to follow her lead - I'm thinking about it...,1312416000,2,103,4.15
4077753,5,B0036I1MX2,"This is not a high production flick, but is quirky, engaging and has lots of fun elements. I especially loved the funny music spots and the references to stage shows with the funny captioning.

You get to see a real human transform herself back into the beautiful healthy creature that she was 20 years earlier. She has adventures at a health farm along the way and ""learns"" raw food inside and out.  The piece on colonics is challenging if you are squeamish about those things, but definitely sheds light on this practice.

In the end, you meet a person that completely changes their life after the 21 days but is then challenged to maintain this quirky form of eating in the real world.  She survives and surfaces raw.  Will you?

4077754,5,B0036I1MX2,"I've dabbled in raw veganism in the past and was feeling unsure about going back to it. One of the reasons I'd fallen off the wagon was that there's a LOT to learn in order to be a healthy raw vegan. Jenna's video helped me to see some of the bases I hadn't covered the first time around. I cannot tell you how much that helped me.

Now on to less practical matters: This thing is really fun. I loved every minute of my time with it. Jenna Norwood is a loving guide, a sister on the path, and a true treat to spend time with!

If you're considering a raw vegan diet--or even if you're just ""raw curious"" as Jenna says, this is a must-see.",1305936000,7,638,4.055555555555555
4077755,5,B0036I1MX2,"I really liked it, very inspirational.  It starts out with her wanting to lose weight and the journey she goes through at a raw food detox retreat.  It will probably be very inspiring to those on the edge of a healthy lifestyle awakening, almost ready to commit/convert to the raw way of eating for health.",1294704000,4,306,4.545454545454546
4077756,3,B0036I1MX2,"Fail for information, win for narcissism.  Not worth $25.00, there is no information for the viewers to take from this film other than worry about your colon and inquire about a cleanse.",1284163200,10,186,4.8125
4077757,5,B0036I1MX2,"I loved the energy of the movie, just a light and positive vibe and not at all preachy or goofy, just plain solid information and entertainment.",1279238400,4,144,4.576923076923077
4077758,5,B0036I1MX2,Jenna explains a raw food path in a profound and original way.  Can't wait for the sequel!~,1269561600,4,91,4.352941176470588
4077759,5,B0036I1MX2,"You can learn from watching Jenna the amazing results from cleansing and making better, healthier food choices. Once you see it, doing it yourself (loosing weight, cleansing your palate and feeling better) is an easier decision. I should know....I've done it too!",1266883200,11,263,5.285714285714286
8390001,5,B0036I1MX2,Jenna Apple Norwood made a fabulous DVD I highly suggest this for anybody that is looking to go and start eating clean .,1454457600,,120,4.260869565217392
8390002,3,B0036I1MX2,"This documentary provides some good information for viewers new to raw eating. I do compare it to Supersize Me because is suppose to be kind of the opposite of that one. So, instead of going junk food for 30 days, the author goes into a raw diet for 30 days. It looks very low budget compared with Supersize Me. The author doesn't go into many details about the process or subject herself in as many tests/examinations as the author of Supersize Me. It still inspired me to look into raw eating and different types of diets or ways of eating like vegetarian and vegan.",1402531200,2,568,4.471153846153846
8390003,5,B0036I1MX2,"I truly enjoyed watching this documentary.  A take off, of course, of ""Supersize me"", this real life journey you take with Jenna Norwood shows you how great an effect a healthy raw food based diet can have.  Just as we saw how harmful the McDonald's diet can be in ""Supersize Me"".  I think most American's just don't realize how damaging many of their food choices are to their health, and could experience some VERY beneficial ""side effects"" if they put even a portion of what they learn here into practice.  I speak from experience - it works!",1367539200,,545,4.587628865979381
8390004,1,B0036I1MX2,"Please, get over yourself. People knows all this! You aren't special. I had been eating right all my life and this is nothing special. You are right about eating right but WE ALL KNOW THAT!",1361750400,2,189,4.428571428571429
8390005,5,B0036I1MX2,I really enjoyed this movie! I even made a speech about it in Toastmasters and everyone was really interested to learn more!,1358726400,4,124,4.681818181818182
8390006,1,B0036I1MX2,The place she went to  detoxs was very important but yet they will not let the cameras in-- meaning they will not allow her to do the most important part of all and that is to talk about the diet and affect on people bodies--- that sucks! so it was not detail at all....supersize me was very detail and fun but supercharge me was not detail and just a plain and boring document..,1336780800,4,379,4.191780821917808
8390007,5,B0036I1MX2,Really enjoyed watching this movie!  Inspiried to do a 30-day supercharge myself.  Sometimes it can seem a bit wacky but that's only because it's a concept that goes against what we've been told.  I don't personally believe in some of the clinics detox ideas but as a whole it's very interesting and entertaining.,1335830400,3,313,4.867924528301887
8390008,4,B0036I1MX2,"I loved the animations that were done. I liked that you were real with people and allowed them in to your life and raw journey. It was amazing to watch the  transformation you went through and it was very noticeable. I went through a colon cleanse last year and (bless her heart) the young lady that allowed that to be filmed was very generous.

The interviews, audio and B-roll was very good and I enjoyed the music tracks that you had.  Something that touched me personally was that you allowed Ben Vereen to share his faith and I appreciate that you did too. I also like the fact you did the update at the end. It was real and honest and showed it was ok to stumble but that you were able to recover. That was inspirational.
