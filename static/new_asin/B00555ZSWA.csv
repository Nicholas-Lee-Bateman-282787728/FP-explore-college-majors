The nice thing is the main couple (Heather Marie Marsden & David James Elliott) are good as the typical couple on the cusp of divorce who bicker and fight about there horrible marriage. When the going gets tough and the husband has to pull out all the stops and show us what a real man can do when its life or death and thank god the wife is no wimp and steps up to the pump for a little skull cracken her self. Now do not get me wrong here I was screaming at the screen telling them what to do next and was really into the movie for a good part of the film, so I liked it, but if this is not your type of trash cinema then why even read this, just go back and watch Twatlight one more time.
I think if you go to the trouble to make a torture porn film then lets make it a strong Rated R or a unrated movie. You know this is never going to the big screen and you know who your audience is so lets get to it and stop pussy footing around. Michael Madsen has fallen so far and to see his name on a movie now is a sure sign that its a turd. I used to love Michael Madsen and think he does a fine job on this stellar film, it's just a far cry from his glory days of ""Kill Bill"" and such. Back to the movie, I had fun and got my moneys worth for sure. So if Hostel meets Vacancy sounds good then this is your movie.",1328572800,,1392,3.738095238095238
4572283,2,B00555ZSWA,"Terror Trap is a pointless horror flick that borrows completely from Vacancy and Hostel.  The movie tells the story of a bickering couple that wind up in a backwoods motel, where they are terrorized by sadistic men as their ordeal is caught on camera for others.

The movie is painfully unoriginal, filled with tedious dialogue, and is riddled with plot holes.  Michael Madsen, easily the best-known actors in the film, phones in his performance for an easy check.  Jeff Fahey turns up the volume on his performance as one of the film's bad guys, but neither his performance nor Madsen's are enough to salvage the movie.

Once in a while, I discover a hidden gem amongst low-budget horror flicks that go straight to video. Terror Trap is not one of them.  It's not worth a rental, so I can't imagine why anyone would actually buy the DVD.  If you're a diehard fan of Jeff Fahey, or wouldn't mind a Vacancy rip-off, it's worth a watch.  Otherwise, renting it is a complete waste of time.",1328054400,3,986,4.626436781609195
4572284,1,B00555ZSWA,"I hate to review a movie before finishing it but I couldn't sit through much of this. What seemed like potential for a very frightening film turned out to be another cheap knockoff of many horror films. I should've known it would be horrible when Michael Madsen and Jeff Fahey were starring in it. I should've run for the hills from the beginning.

Nothing, absolutely nothing about this was original. You have an argumentative husband and wife whose road trip land them in trouble.

Out of respect for potential viewers and because I am trying my best to forget I've seen any of this movie, I will leave my review here. This film has a bunch of ridiculous surprises and you just have to watch the film (if you can) to catch them. It tries to be suspenseful but falls short.

As for the actors, sigh. I used to be such a big Michael Madsen fan but he hasn't been in a decent film since The Getaway in '93! It's sad to see an actor of his caliber drift further and further into B-movie land but too late. Same for Jeff Fahey. I always enjoyed him and he's a good actor but I can't stomach the types of movies he does now. From now on I will be smart and avoid films with these two, along with anything Billy Zane is in, like the plague.

Sorry but I can't recommend this crud of a movie to anyone.",1324944000,,1296,4.234817813765182
4572285,4,B00555ZSWA,Pretty good flick.  David Elliott saved it from being boring.  He elevated the story and made it much better than a stock horror movie.,1320451200,2,135,4.583333333333333
4572286,2,B00555ZSWA,"""Well, it'll be an interesting evening.""  After a hit and run accident Don (Elliot) and Nancy are left stranded in the middle of nowhere.  After the local sheriff gives them a ride to a motel run by Carter (Madsen) they soon realize that this is not the safest place for them to be.  This movie started off really good, you feel tense when the cop talks to the passengers and really pull for the strangers.  Then after the 20 min mark the movie starts to fall apart and drag on, and on, and on.  Think ""Vacency"" without the horror and excitement.  There are a lot of aspects they introduce that seem to go nowhere, and the ones that do aren't exciting enough to follow.  I do like Michael Madsen (who doesn't like ""Reservoir Dogs"") but his last few movies have been bad, like Val Kilmer bad, and I hope that he will once again start making real movies. Overall, this movie was much better when it was called ""Vacency"".  I give it a C-.

Would I watch again? - Nope.

8457573,5,B00555ZSWA,"I ordered this movie cause it was in my recommendations, I'm a big fan of motel movies.  Never seen this before upon ordering but it turned out to be a good movie!",1433462400,,163,4.09375
8457574,1,B00555ZSWA,"I watched this last night because I love vacancy and thought this might be good. Yeah no. 1st off, 40 minutes is just it getting started, then the last 30 minutes is action. 2nd, the actors act like this is a movie and not a situation the way they are chasing them around. 3rd, their just are sudden parts of random violence and nonsense where you can see they just are trying to make the movie better. DO NOT BUY. If you REALLY wanna see it, just watch it on putlocker.com for free because I wouldn't pay 1 penny to see this movie .",1421625600,,533,4.134615384615385
8457575,2,B00555ZSWA,"Wow, Dirty Harry wannabe at its worst!  It's one thing to be a hero in the movie, but to succeed in killing or wounding most bad guys without getting seriously hurt, is another.  Just a, ""Vacancy"" rip-off, which many have stated.  How many more movies with this similar storyline need to be told?  Though not my kind of horror entertainment, I didn't hate it, but did not like it either.",1419552000,,387,4.485714285714286
8457576,1,B00555ZSWA,"This is one cheap rip-off of the much superior, Vacancy, which at least had a realistic, feisty couple who fought for their lives in a motel hell. In this one, there is a total lack of logic. We have females who all act as if they're a bunch of rabbits--all they do is scream, and gibber and slobber and do absolutely nothing to defend themselves or try to escape a bunch of loonies who have lured them to this motel--which is actually a trap run by psychos who love to video tape their capture and torture. The main couple here show all the logic you would expect from roadkill. While the hero battles and fights to ward off their killers, all his child-like girl friend does is scream and cower in the corner. So much of the dialogue is the wimpy hero instructing his friend to run to the car, run as fast you can, blah blah. And at the end, it's hard to tell what happened to the couple--or all of the villians. Most were killed but others appeared to survive. This should be a great addition to the Mystery-Science Fiction Theater roster.",1406332800,2,1042,4.376288659793815
8457577,1,B00555ZSWA,"The movie is too similar to Vacancy.  The married couple having problems was very annoying (the unhappy couple was much better in the movie Vacancy) and the wife kept telling people to f-off, which added nothing to her character.  The addition of Michael Madison's character seemed a little pointless as the ""ring leader""...really what was the point?  he was hardly in the film then shows up at the end to kill a henchman who mentioned the ""organization""??  i guess it was suppose to be menacing and lead the audience to know the threat is still out there....yep... the threat of a sequel!!
Since it is a rip off of Vacancy and a crappy rip off with annoying characters it gets one star. If you are going to rip off a movie at least make an improvement upon it.",1377993600,,761,4.492753623188406
8457578,5,B00555ZSWA,I ordered this for my brother. I do not watch scarry or gory movies. He said he got it quickly and had no problems,1366243200,,114,3.7916666666666665
8457579,1,B00555ZSWA,"Terror Trap (Dan Garcia, 2010)

It seems The Asylum is not the only company dabbling in the mockbuster business these days. Most Wanted Films, the company behind Lockjaw: Rise of the Kulev Serpent, bankrolled this horrible knockoff of Vacancy so similar I'm surprised writer/director Dan Garcia didn't get sued. (I suspect there's a cadre of Hollywood lawyers who have it down to a science how many scenes have to be different in order to stop studio A from suing studio B for plagiarism, and this movie is right on the border.) The only thing that marginally redeems this flick is the interplay between Michael Madsen and Jeff Fahey, of which there is far too little here to redeem this in any way. If you've seen Vacancy, which wasn't all that great in the first place, you don't need to bother with this--and if you haven't, that is certainly preferable to this.

8457580,1,B00555ZSWA,"If you saw Vacancy, then you know exactly what this movie is about. It's basically the same movie, just not as good as Vacancy. A couple finds themselves trapped at a motel where they are terrorized by  masked men who are bent on killing them for the sake of enteratining an audience who has paid to watch a live broadcast of a brutal murder..

I don't understand how someone can write almost the same exact script as another movie, call it their own and have no sense of embarrassment over doing it.",1355443200,,500,4.423913043478261
8457581,3,B00555ZSWA,"Terror Trap is definitely a low budget horror with a few big name actors, but the plotline is pretty lackluster.  The biggest problem is that it takes forever for the storyline to actually get *moving* so we have to sit through several generic and predictable segments waiting for the storyline to finally get underway.

The most offensive example of generic writing comes when the main characters (a man and his wife) are driving in a car on some back road and... you guessed it, behind them pulls up another vehicle shining their excessively bright headlights in their rear view window and blinding them.

This leads to a minor accident immediately after... which means the man and his wife are now stranded in the middle of nowhere and surrounded by trees.  Then a ""police officer"" comes to the rescue... only to take them to a hotel that's occupied with vicious residents who are actually completely warped and spend their days watching people in the parking lot and hotel rooms get murdered in graphic fashion.  The people actually have video cameras and televisions hooked up in the backroom and sit around watching the innocent people run for their lives.  How twisted!

It takes a LONG time for the storyline to follow through.  Too much useless time is devoted to terribly bland writing and well, basically total fluff that never accomplishes much of anything.

However your reward for sitting through all that nothingness is that eventually the residents DO get upset and chase the man and his wife around with knives while wearing masks.  Of course the way they chase them around is more like a bully luring an innocent kid into a dangerous situation- I mean these bad guys most certainly COULD have killed the man and woman if they really wanted to be aggressive enough about it.

The cop that drove the man and woman to the hotel turns out to be the one who's the most screwed up in the head, and he's also the biggest threat.

Overall, waiting a good 30 minutes for some actual action and excitement to take place is what you can expect.  Once the man and woman find out what kind of vicious people they're dealing with, only then does the film go anywhere at all.  Until that point arrives, expect to be unentertained for a while.  Oh, and someone please PLEASE smack the mans wife for being obnoxious and relentless with the ""F"" word.  It's one thing to not get along with your husband, but a completely other thing to criticize and humiliate him so he feels ""this tall"".  Give me a break!",1329523200,,2505,4.669703872437358
