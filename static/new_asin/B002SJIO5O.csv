3980938,5,B002SJIO5O,"Where do I start?  I had very little idea what this film was going in, and I think I can thank Jackson and the studio for keeping the trailers pretty cryptic.  If you're anything like me, you prefer as little information as possible.  Then just go see this film.  If you're not convinced, read on...

Aliens arrive and we have no idea why.  We do know their journey has not gone according to plan.  Like countless ancient voyages on our own world, something has gone terribly wrong for them.  They're just hovering over a South African city and don't even get out.  Were they just passing through and had mechanical trouble, an illness, or an accident on board?  Was it an invasion force originally?  Was it a ship intentionally sent to make contact over a dangerous, long-distance voyage after detecting Earth?  Again, we don't know.  There's a casual explanation the characters have settled on as likely, but it's inconclusive.

Now, the idea you have this big high tech ship, all these technicians and workers who are starving on board, and no apparent ability to get it going completely changes the normal sci fi dynamic of powerful, nearly immortal beings, with complete control over their faculties, their hardware, and clear goals in mind.  This huge crew is borderline Donner Party and appears in total anarchy.  Maybe this was just the nearest habitable planet they could get to?  Dry land as they were running out of food and power?

Humans, the resident natives, take a form of pity on them to the extent that a fairly short-sighted international attempt is made (think the UN) to assist these visitors, provide impromptu shelter, and feed them.  Of course, they were hovering over South Africa, so they're now living in slums directly below, with a poorly organized & conceptualized multinational (cough) organization administering, and a particularly influential international corporation doing contract work.  Did I mention there were like hundreds of thousands of beings that look like walking crustaceans on board?

Short-lived good-intentions.  Racial slurs.  Meat eating.  Cannibalism.  Third world population control.  African corruption.  African criminal undergrounds.  African slums.  African mysticism.  Xenophobia.  Corporate corruption.  Multinationals ineptitudes.  Cultural insensitivity.  Greed.  Unauthorized medical experimentation.  Violence.  Forced relocations.  Fear.  Fear mongering.  And, oh, loads of unintended consequences that real life is so full of.

Most intriguing of all in this film, how mundane the aliens are by human standards, once you get past the physiological differences...which we never seem to.  When foreigners on Earth showed up in high-tech ships, natives always assumed more from the visitors than was justified.  Gods.  Immortality.  Secret powers behind their technologies that could never be learned.  And most of all, an assumption of fundamental difference.  Yet without a single exception ever, the visitors were not gods.  They could be injured quite easily.  Their technologies could be adapted.  And the fundamental nature of intelligent beings was essentially identical, regardless of skin color, the shape of nose, height, or language.

This film is an astounding exploration of an ordinary story line but with an extra ordinary attempt at realism, historical precedent, and attention to detail.  This is not G.I. Joe.  Everything in this film oozes believability.  From the lack of super intelligence in the aliens themselves, to the shanty towns, to the desert haze obscuring the giant mother ship in the distance, to the convoys, and on and on.  The people who worked on District 9 worked their butts off royally.  In fact, I am not overstating when I say there are no animatronic or CGI seams apparent whatsoever.  This is truly the first special effects film I can say there was nothing artificial or synthetic about its look...ever.

There are some provisos.  The film is offensive.  It's harsh.  It's graphic.  Much of the first half is also a very fast-paced, documentary-style attempt to get us up to speed with the events of the past twenty years.  At first you might find yourself looking around going, this is still being set-up and divulged?  Yet the semi-linear intertwining of previously recorded footage, interviews, with a present-moment narrative (that actually isn't present) works exceedingly well.  It's engaging sufficient to keep you constantly surprised, impressed, disgusted, and curious to find out more along this build-up.  The turn it takes I won't spoil, but it is worth the effort to have watched attentively.

My reactions in the first few minutes were a mix of thinking I was watching something a bit juvenile & rushed, then getting disturbed, and finally a series of continuous moments of being impressed the hell out of by what this film was achieving.  It's not amazing in its plotting, its solving of a puzzle, beautiful art direction (it's actually gritty, dirty, and totally naturalistic), or stunning lighting & photographic composition.  It's not an art film for its esthetics, but for its ideas, substance, and a complete rejection of esthetic for any other purpose but to suspend disbelief.  It is speculative and philosophical fiction of the highest and most challenging caliber, and I highly recommend it to adults.",1250294400,5,5331,5.256837098692033
3980939,5,B002SJIO5O,"Fantasy and Science Fiction.
Of all the genre's out there these two are the ones that have the most creative potential.
Unfortunately, most fantasy falls into the footsteps of Tolkien and most SF ends up in a galaxy far away, yet something we've seen a billion times before.
Thankfully, the minds behind DISTRICT 9 created a SF film that thinks OUTSIDE THE BOX.

An alien ship comes down to earth.
Now most other SF films would have you believe that the US is the only country on planet Earth, the only place where alien craft show up.
Most other SF films follow some unwritten rule that all aliens have to attack earth and are bent on destroying humanity.
Most other SF films depend heavily on Skywalkers, Spocks, characters similar to those and gratuitous amounts of Special Effects.
That is not the case in this movie.

If all you ever watch or expect of SF is ""Science Fiction for the masses"" then you're going to be disappointed.
But if you want something challenging and original, prefer GATTACA to INDEPENDENCE DAY and PAN'S LABYRINTH to DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS . . .
Then chances are you're in for a real treat!",1250208000,6,1116,4.6313131313131315
3980940,5,B002SJIO5O,"This film is one of the most original and thought-provoking science fiction movies ever.  Director Neill Blokamp has said, in making his film, that he loved sci-fi, and that he only wanted to bring sci-fi to his native Johannesburg, and that the history of South Africa naturally brought forth different ideas for doing a sci-fi film.

It surely does - to re-visit the history of apartheid in South Africa in this science fiction story is to re-visit the entire history of human oppression of other humans, with strong echoes of the casual genocides, enslavements, and/or forced re-settlements of countless peoples from history.  In fact, the farther we look, the more one begins to realize that there has never been a time in human history, or pre-history, when this sort of stuff was not going on - Did we eat the Neanderthals? asks a popular discussion forum here on Amazon.  Most assuredly, IMHO, the answer is YES.  And so here we are... instead of the Neanderthals...

Blokamp's film is shot like a documentary, with talking heads speaking extemporaneously in flashback, lots of hand-held cameras, security camera-like footage, and the like.

The story I will only briefly rehash here in this review without giving too much away.  Basically, a large alien spaceship has appeared, stranded in mid-air, over the city of Johannesburg, South Africa.  Its occupants are over a million giant crustacean-like creatures (close cousins in appearance to the alien in ""Predator""), quickly labeled as ""prawns"".  Here, the story takes a twist - these fearsome-looking aliens are just like the lovable ""E.T."" - peaceful, lost, and seeking only to get back home, they are  befuddled by humans, and their docile, passive nature makes them helpless to the depradations of humans trying to gain their weapons technology.  The alien weapons turn out to work only when contacted by alien DNA, and so begins the scheming to figure out how to get these weapons to function.

The movie focuses on one Wikus Van De Merwe, a smiling and pleasant bureaucrat working for the giant corporation MNU.  In the beginning part of the movie, we watch through the lens of a cameraman following him around at work.  Wikus's friendly banter with co-workers, his upbraiding of heavily armed mercenaries to stick to the rules, his casual disregard for his own safety in the midst of confused and angry aliens, his happy, cheerful attitude towards committing atrocities while doing his work, and his ability to justify what he is doing to the ""prawns"", has a truly surreal, Monty-Pythonesque quality to it all.  It is not often that one sees a first class bureaucrat like him onscreen, and his character brings to mind two things: Hannah Arendt's comment about Adolph Eichmann as the ""banality of evil"", and of course, that other movie about wacko bureacrats out of control, Terry Gilliam's ""Berlin"".

What Wikus does to the ""prawns"" in the early part of the movie includes unplugging the nourishment sources inside a shack full of fetal ""prawns"", handing a bottle-like feeding device to one of his guards and saying ""here's a souvenir, it's your first abortion! heh, heh"" and then continuing with a pleasant running commentary for the cameraman, describing the ""popcorn"" sounds of the exploding fetal aliens inside the shack, as his men burn it down.

No, this is not a movie for the squeamish, or those easily disturbed by cruelty to animals, even crustaceans.

The tables turn on Wikus when he accidentally sprays himself with this specially prepared fluid which the alien named Christopher has been preparing.  Christopher has been working on collecting and making this fluid for the last 20 years, and it holds the key to providing the power for their spaceship to leave Earth again.  The fluid also starts transforming Wikus into a ""prawn"", which coincidentally allows him to work the alien weapons.  And so the story goes into full action mode, as the MNU captures Wikus and tries to harvest him for their weapons program, Wikus escapes ... and well, you should go see this movie!!

Sharlto Copley is the star of the movie, doing a fabulous portrayal of a middling bureacrat in way over his head, beginning as a cheerful ""banality-of-evil"" type, he transitions through a phase of sniveling deal-making trying to get himself out of this huge jam, before finally accepting his fate and the obvious, to become the hero of the movie.

As a sci-fi movie, the cruelties and indignities visited upon these ugly-looking crustaceans inside their concentration camp may appear less obviously horrifying or unjust, but they should trigger one's sense of justice and fairness; this story is but a Rorschach test of the soul, as it is in truth nothing more than an allegory for human cruelty to other humans, describing the innate drive of humans to conquer or dominate other humans and species throughout the millenia.

Why do these aliens, with such powerful weaponary, not use them on the humans, and why is it that they are so docile and passive?  The thought occurred to me afterwards, based on a comment from one of the talking heads early on in the film, that these aliens must have been a worker class, or perhaps were even slaves, and that maybe this alien ship was a slave ship with an absent and unseen master race of aliens.  That would explain a lot of things, but alien civilization could be structured a lot of different ways - we'll just have to see if I'm right, as there is talk of a much deserved sequel to this movie already.

This is a movie that will leave you thinking long after you have seen it, and it is almost certain to become a classic of the sci-fi genre.",1250208000,6,5646,4.877615062761507
3980941,4,B002SJIO5O,"Co-produced by Peter Jackson, the acclaimed director of the ""Lord of the Rings"" and directed by Neil Blomkamp; `DISTRICT 9"" screams ""Cult Classic"". Blomkamp has adapted his short film called ""Alive in Joberg"" and has crafted a film loosely inspired by the events of District 6 in South Africa. ""District 9"" collects some familiar pieces of history, science fiction elements, and some cool action in a tale which is mainly a retelling of man's nature to condemn someone or something different. While it contains a strong social commentary, the film itself is more of a visually stunning piece of a slick actioner.

Some 20 years ago, a huge alien mother ship becomes stranded in Earth's atmosphere due to mechanical issues when its power source seemingly disappears. It hovers above the city of Johannesburg, South Africa with about a suffering alien race trapped inside. They are brought down to Earth by local government and forced to live in conditions similar to a refugee camp, which soon becomes a slum called ""District 9"". As the aliens, dubbed ""Prawns"" by the humans who harbor them, become more adaptive to their dwelling, they become more hostile and a little too burdensome since they have grown in number. The task of relocating them falls on a multi-national task force called ""MNU"" into a concentration camp located 200 km outside Johannesburg. Its chief operative, Wikus (Sharlton Copley) leads a team of mercenaries to go door by door to evict the alien settlers, but the aliens aren't going quietly as Wikus ends up being exposed to a mysterious black fluid which has provoked several changes in his body. Forced to hide when he finds out that his superiors wish to dissect him, he flees to District 9 where he befriends an alien that he calls ""Christopher"". The two embark on a mission to cure Wikus and to return the ""prawns"" to return to their home world; such action brings them on a collision course with M.N.U.

Part ""Alien Nation"" and part Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" with some touches of a re-examination of the depredation of apartheid with an other-worldly backdrop, the film is more or less a visitation story about an abused race of aliens that are being taken advantaged of, feared but nonetheless the humans are interested in what they could milk from the alien culture. The aliens are separated from the human population with little to no rights bestowed on them. The social and political commentary/overtones are strong in the film's screenplay most especially in the first half, when the director Blomkamp shoots the proceedings in a style quite similar to a documentary. You see the events unraveling as if everything had already occurred in the past, with some highlights of news reels, interviews and that the viewer is supposed to look forward to whatever future this situation may bring. Its political and social points are brought forward by Blomkamp in a very clever way, as he succeeds in bringing an atmosphere of humiliation and horrific hatred by man towards the aliens.

The aliens dubbed ""Prawns"" (supposed to be a degrading slur, but the actual name of the alien race wasn`t revealed) are also cleverly developed. While we only see subtle hints of their alien culture, you can see that they are a ""people"" with intelligence and their own technology. They are intelligent and have their own native language which Wikus had deciphered. Some are criminals; some are just minding their own business while some have ambition, with a longing to return to their world. The ""prawns' addiction to cat food give an impression that they may be marine creatures (cat food has a fishy taste) and that they have become interested in inter-species mating as shown with the Nigerians' prostitution ring in district 9.

Any culture or group of immigrants has something to offer, and the humans are interested in their technology. We see as to how different people approach this interest, as major corporations are taking a scientific approach while the Nigerians are approaching this from a mystical level. Two human traits are explored and they both involve taking the alien bodies apart. It was curious that the alien weapons can only be used by one of the ""prawns""; it is a curious fail safe so that no one can use their weaponry against them. I'd like to think that the aliens are more the peaceful race in the film (since they took no steps in invading the nearby city or will they?) while us humans are more into protecting our interests such as the development of military weapons and to some, for profit.

Enough about the political overtone, the second half of the film puts its focus on Wikus, when his accident becomes a living nightmare. The scenes when he begins to evolve into something less human could've been more icky and gooey but Blomkamp opts to approach the matter with some occasional news reels and the conventional filmmaking. This style may prove to be a bit of challenge to some since the details can easily become confusing that may leave one to wonder if it's a documentary or a dramatization? But I have to commend the direction, he manages to keep the details together although he doesn`t give all the answers but gives the viewer something to anticipate in the future, I guess it may also be seen as an attempt to emulate reality because things like this do happen at times in a different manner; such as the nature of humanity.

The accident proves to be the catalyst for the film's action sequences which mostly occurs in its last 25 minutes. The special effects in the film are nicely done; I really enjoyed the alien weaponry that was brought into bear. While I thought some didn't seem too advance most of them do pack a mean wallop. I did enjoy the combat between an alien exo-suit piloted by Wikus against the mercenaries; they were visually stunning and quite gritty in their own way. There is quite a lot of rehearsed explosions that displays the wonderment of alien technology that takes the film to an even more violent level. The film also has a good amount of blood and gore especially in the final climactic showdown as bullets fly, missiles are fired and bodies are torn apart in a very disquieting manner.

Granted, ""District 9"" isn't a perfect film, its script has several inconsistencies and some plot missteps; it does leave the viewer to fill in the gaps and left to assume at times. Blomkamp may have intentionally left some questions unanswered as the final act asks another question that leaves us with the possibility of a sequel. Personally, I didn't mind the underdeveloped story; the film had enough intensity and enough ambition to keep me interested. Despite some flaws in the script, its execution was precise. The aliens are cool and Blomkamp exhibits enough filmmaking zest that has me all set for ""District 10"".

Highly Recommended! [4- Stars]",1250208000,5,6833,4.849185946872322
3980942,3,B002SJIO5O,"Neill Blomkamp makes his directorial debut in a ho-hum science fiction film produced by Peter Jackson.  Sharlto Copley (yeah, I've never heard of him either) stars as the protagonist Wikus Van De Merwe, a dweeby, pencil pushing bureaucrat that works for an agency that monitors giant computer generated cockroaches.  Ok, they aren't really cockroaches, they're actually supposed to be a race of extraterestrial beings from...?  Well, I guess that isn't important.

The plot is basically this:

20 years ago an extraterrestrial spaceship appears over Johannesburg, South Africa.  Instead of being invaders or ambassadors of peace, the aliens turned out to be a bunch of refugees.  Not knowing what to do with them they were placed in a militarized camp just outside the city.  The humanoid bugs have been in those camps for 20 years, and society has developed extreme predjudices against the ""prawns"".

The MNU (A UN knockoff) has been granted authority over human/alien relations, and Wikus Van De Merwe has been placed in charge of moving the aliens to a new militarized camp farther from the city.  However, Van De Merwe goes power mad and acts like a jerk during the relocation.  Then he accidently becomes infected with an alien virus that begins to alter his DNA.  The virus mutates him making him more bug like along the way.  Because extraterrestrail DNA is the key to unlocking the alien technology; Van De Merwe becomes a fugitive.  Although the plot itself is interesting, the movie generates little excitement.

The film begins in a style reminiscent of a documentary.  If you love PBS or C-SPAN you'll feel right at home; however, this isn't what I payed to see.  I felt mislead because trailers and marketing ploys made this seem like it was going to be an action adventure movie similar to ""Independence Day"".

Don't get me wrong; there were some great action sequences with alien guns and machines that could have came straight of a Robert Heinlein novel, but there was just too much social commentary for me.  I watch the occasional drama from time to time, but I wasn't expecting it in this movie.  It was the whole corporations are evil, humans exploit the weak, racism...blah blah blah; you get the idea.  I saw ""Crash"", but today I didn't go to the movie to watch a bunch of political crap.  I went to the movies to try to tune out the junk I'm bombarded with on the news every day; I wanted a popcorn thrill ride like Peter Jackson's King Kong.  Like I said, I was expecting ""Independence Day"" and got ""Hotel Rwanda"" meets ""Alien Nation"" instead.  However, my main problem with the movie was the protagonist's character and the film's conclusion.

I honestly could have cared less about the lead in this film.  He was a jerk, a nerd, and he only became a good guy out of self preservation.  There wasn't anything chivalrous about the dude, and the ending is incomplete.  I'm not going to ruin it for you but don't expect a plot resolution, because the ending is very unsatisfying.",1250208000,9,3001,4.797270955165692
3980943,5,B002SJIO5O,"This movie is a powerful testament to human imagination and creativity. It's a brilliant work of art. I also see it as a succinct summary of human history: the powerful torturing and exploiting the weak. True, some of the powerful feel compassion for the weak. And most of the powerful just go along for the ride, trying to keep their hands clean.

Well, in District 9, the aliens, whom humans refer to as ""prawns,"" could stand for the weak in human history. The aliens were stranded twenty years earlier when their mother ship, for some unknown reason, was marooned in the sky over Johannesburg, South Africa. They soon fell under human control when they came to Earth. They are confined to District 9, a horrible slum, where the poorest South Africans had lived. They are treated as ""no-class citizens"" and forced to live on the meager handouts of the government.

Sharlto Copley earns his star status as Wikus Van De Merwe. Wikus appears to be a by-the-book nerd. He's a high-ranking bureaucrat for MNU, the devious private military contractor that controls the aliens. Wikus is willing to cover up the brutal treatment that is meted out to the aliens. For example, he tries to get them to sign documents that they do not understand. These documents will ruin their lives. But, he's sort of an Everyman, who views himself as a decent person.

Well, Wikus proves to be one cunning, tough, and resourceful man. The Academy should create a ""Best Actor in an Alien Encounter Film Award"" just for Copley.

Saying much more might spoil this most exciting movie. The stunts and special effects are stunning. It held my rapt attention. Just great.",1250208000,,1642,4.791519434628976
3980944,5,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is the best Sci Fi film that I've seen in years. The greatness of movies like Bladerunner, Star Wars or E.T. was the humanity on display and the mirrors that they offered into real life. District 9 falls into this catagory. Taking place in Johannesburg, South Africa, we follow a story already in progress. The aliens are already here. The communication gap has been bridged. The ""prawns"" have been segregated and reside in slums where life is miserable. The plot line revolves around our protagonists initial efforts to relocate the ""prawns"" from District 9 to District 10, essentially a concentration camp located 200km away from town.

The main character played by Sharlto Copley, Wikus undergoes a transformationn on screen that has to be seen to be believed. Without spoiling any plot points, I will say that it is remarkable that the character depicted in the first 20 minutes and played at the end are the same person. The ""prawn"" characters are amazing as well. As intended, I initially looked at every appearance on screen as disturbing. They were ugly, hateful, vile creatures. As the film plays out, you begin to feel sympathy for them and root for them. Then you realise that their success in what we are shown would probably represent the end of humanity. It's amazing how the creators of the film are able to suck you into this story when there is basically one human dominating the screen and several seven foot tall bi-ped lobsters.

The film looks great. Although a portion of the film is told through hand held camera, broadcast news style and documentary, about midway through the film, it moves to a more traditional style. The imagery is amazing. Like Bladerunner, this world feels real, despite being science fiction. Everything from the aliens to their weapons to the space craft look terrific. I imagined the film at a $100-$125 million budget. I was shocked to hear it was done for $30 million. It also has to be mentioned that the level of gore hear excedes many modern horror films. There are scenes of torture on both humans and aliens. Niether are easy to watch. The action scenes are amazing, but again, exceptionally graphic.

District 9 is the type of disc that you purchase to showcase your system. Becuase parts of D9 are shown in a gritty documentary style, you might think BluRay would be a waste. When not told in documentary style, D9 looks superb, and for those who can't figure out the difference in low and hi resolution images, there are some great contrasts here that really that show off blu rays power. It also should be noted that the film is shown at 1:85 aspect ratio, that means the entire screen is full - no noticible black bars. The only other Blu Ray that I can remember showing like this is The Dark Knight, perhaps the best Blu Ray ever. I also need to mention the sound as it is dynamite throughout - especially the sound variances from the documentary to traditional movie portions. D9 is loaded with BR only extras. BDLive has multiple online components including a very cool ""pop up video"" style feature that lets you look at a variety of facts about the movie and actors. There are also the standard features that include a digital copy, director commentary and deleted scenes. There are also some D9 features that I imagine are on the standard DVD as well, maps and other geek out features.

Despite a beginning that may feel a bit slow to non genre fans, District 9 is the rare combination of great story, actors and special effects. Simply brilliant, one of the best movies I've ever seen and I'm really glad that the BluRay release lives up to the movie's quality throughout.",1250208000,,3650,4.716300940438871
3980945,5,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 asks the question, how quickly can you become an alien? An alien spaceship appears over Johannesburg, South Africa and hovers for three months before humans decide to enter it. Inside they find a race of beings not vastly superior in technology or attributes but beings dying. Aid is offered the aliens, they're brought to makeshift camp which quickly becomes a refuge camp, and finally a ghetto. The aliens are put under the control of the MNU (multi-national united).

District 9 has become too small for the growing alien population, who are derogatorily called prawns. The aliens are forced to live in `dehumanizing' and degrading circumstances, crime is rampant, interspecies prostitution, organized crime has moved in to take advantage of the aliens. MNU has decided to relocate the aliens and Wickus van der Merwe, a career bureaucrat who owes his position to nepotism is put in charge of the relocation. During the relocation Wickus opens an alien canister is accidentally sprayed with a fluid that quickly starts altering his DNA and transforming him into an alien. When it's discovered he's mutating he's taken to a secret part of the MNU building that is closer to Mengele's labs than the alien autopsy video. The decision is made to ""harvest"" Wickus organs for their potential in biological technology. Wickus manages an escape and branded a criminal and his changing appearance quickly finds the bigotry and prejudice reserved for the aliens makes him an alien on his own planet, and the only place he can hide is District 9.

In District 9 Wickus finds an alien named Christopher (the aliens were assigned human names) who promises to change him to fully human if they can retrieve the canister the fluid was in that sprayed Wickus and get to the mothership hovering above the city. In retrieving the canister starts a cycle of betrayal with Christopher and Wickus, each acting in his own selfish self interest.

District 9 is the reason I enjoy good science fiction, a good story that while some of the circumstances may be fantastic, but they thoughtfully highlight the human condition and it's problems. The aliens look like aliens, that is not human. And they speak an alien language with no cinematic ploys to have them speaking English, and director Neill Blomkamp ably develops sympathy for these very alien looking creatures. There are a couple gun fights and car chases but there is tension that keeps you invested in the outcome and what happens to both Wickus and Christopher.",1250208000,2,2512,4.976190476190476
3980946,5,B002SJIO5O,"After much anticipation and some seriously startling reviews (almost all glowingly positive) District 9 has finally been unleashed upon the world.

This year, especially this summer, has been sorely lacking in truly escapist and honestly entertaining films.  District 9 is essentially this year's Mighty Mouse, swooping in to save the day.

Aliens, with their gigantic ship parked above the South African city of Johannesburg, have been languishing in Human imposed slums for twenty years, seemingly without purpose (except for the acquisition and consumption of cat food).  Humans have had enough of these aliens close proximity and are about to enforce a massive relocation to a new ""camp"" many, many miles away.  The MNU is the task force assigned to watch and move these visitors from space.  When evictions begin under the leadership of Wikus Van De Merwe (played by Sharlto Copley, who deserves a preliminary Oscar nomination, right now) things go horribly awry.  Especially for Wikus.

I'd write more about what happens after this point, but spoilers are the devil, let's just say this movie exponentially increases its coolness with each subsequent frame of footage.  Not only do we get a compelling, well told story, we get one heck of an acting debut by Copley.  We get insanely awesome (and insanely lethal) alien weapons, disturbingly realistic aliens, and a directorial debut from Neill Blomkamp that seriously reminds me of Spielberg announcing his presence to the world with Duel.  That's right, Spielberg (minus all the sentimentality).

District 9 is a slap in the face to the bloated economics of say, Michael Bay, that riddle the so called ""blockbusters"" of Hollywood.  This little film, which somehow only cost $30 million, has more bang for its buck than the ridiculous, over the top, and borderline racist Transformers 2.  Heck, this movie has a robot in it that puts to shame every single robot in both Transformers movies, for its purposeful design and realistic appearance.

If you need to cleanse your palate after this summer's offal like offerings, District 9 is a cool drink of water with an insanity chaser.

This is how you make a good movie!",1250208000,5,2173,5.096045197740113
3980947,4,B002SJIO5O,"Essentially retooling the Halo movie that never was and adapting his short film ""Alive in Joburg"", director Neill Blomkamp, with producer Peter Jackson, has crafted one of the most creative and exciting science fiction adventures in the last decade. Almost seamlessly blending aliens into a slightly futuristic society, District 9 utilizes a ""live"" footage approach similar to 2008's Cloverfield and merges it with documentary style editing to reveal an effectively realistic vision that feels all the more authentic due to its underlying comparisons and parallels to past and current South African struggles. Not to mention its prophetic accuracy to what a real alien encounter would likely evolve into. Subtexts and foreshadowing aside, we're still left with an absolutely riveting action film laced with solid special effects and a stunning self-reflection on what it means to be human.

It has been twenty years since the massive alien spaceship ""crash-landed"" above the city of Johannesburg and the millions of insect-like alien inhabitants were hoarded into the rescue camp turned slums of District 9. The aliens are drones with hive mind mentality and have been unable to create a hierarchy of leadership to aid in their tragedy. Global conglomerate MNU's Alien Affairs division was created as a diplomatic bridge to the alien culture, but as conditions inside the fenced-off community rapidly worsened and the violence and criminal activity escalated, a mass exodus to a new location outside Johannesburg appeared the only solution.

Cocky but oblivious MNU employee Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is chosen to head the colossal task of the District 9 eviction and encounters heavy hostility and hatred from the reluctant aliens. When Wikus is accidentally infected by an alien device and begins to undergo alarming physical changes, he discovers MNU's true objective, and the now condemned fugitive must join forces with an unlikely ally to wage war against an enemy of nearly limitless power.

District 9 represents the dawn of a new subgenre: the science-fiction documentary. It started with films like Cloverfield and Children of Men, but is nearly perfected with this alien extravaganza. Grounding extreme sci-fi themes with pseudo-documentary filmmaking techniques and as much realism as possible to suspend disbelief almost entirely, District 9 admirably feels entirely plausible (except perhaps for the interspecies prostitution). With expert attention to details, an expansive mythos and the idea that humans are evil (which requires little persuading), the film substitutes a familiar global situation with isolated alien creatures, all backed with dramatic emotional conflict. There's almost no need for explaining - the aliens look monstrous but serve the role of any refugee camp survivors or apartheid, with a lack of food and equality, segregation, poor living conditions, children running rampant and general disorganization. It's especially effective for American audiences, since Johannesburg is already foreign.

Derogatory terms, racism and ignorance naturally lead to exploitation - in this case the evil MNU corporation is both the second largest weapon manufacturer and in charge of alien interactions. No wonder the ""prawns"" are easier to sympathize with. But the initial hostility, prejudices and betrayal turn to chances at redemption, escape and finally revenge. And these prove to be highly action-packed themes, complete with CG-heavy alien warfare technology, massive firepower, and Transformer-like combat. ""My men have done this a hundred times before,"" claims the ruthless mercenary Colonel. Clearly they haven't before encountered such destructive and bloodthirsty extraterrestrial weaponry. Although an eventual movie based on the popular video game Halo would still be fascinating to see, District 9 thoroughly quenches the thirst for hard-hitting science-fiction adventure.

A guy becomes an Alien... from Alien Fuel, and then helps an Alien get back to his Ship.
Along the way, the government stays out of the way, as much as possible, but a privately hired munitions company can't stop two guys, despite multiple military units getting butchered.

Oh, but the Main Evil Commander Dude doesn't need to take cover, or protect himself, ever, because he's too Hardcore to get killed.
He's just gonna keep rolling through, and causing unrealistic delays to make the movie last longer than 15mins.

Seriously, this was a 15min movie, maybe 25mins, exaggerated to an absurd Extreme.

The previews can be skipped, but only by using the Skip Forward feature (not the top menu). One last concern I have is the pop-up menu seems to be unresponsive or non-existent.

Director Neil Blomkamp takes things too far, wasting time with sickening gore that distracts from his narrative.

But showing how ill-equipped contemporary diplomacy is to handle outsiders or ""threats,"" we're left asking questions about the implications of any foreign policy. My issue with the movie is its protagonist - ""Wikus."" I couldn't stand him. He bugged the crap out of me. He distracted me. I kept wanting him to go away, and his central presence made the movie difficult to watch. But that strangely adds to the integrity of this piece.

3981028,5,B002SJIO5O,"It's cool, original, creepy, symbolic, poignant, equal parts sic-fi, horror, action.and even some odd moments of off kilter humor. It is vast social commentary wrapped in a hell of a ride.",1478995200,,188,5.096774193548387
3981029,4,B002SJIO5O,"This is actually a decent movie, but it could be considered another version of how ugly people can be when they have power over something weaker (or just plain different).  It was unclear why the one group was so much weaker, in some respects, though, which was a bit odd because they were actually a lot stronger.  So on the one hand, it's a good movie; but on the other, it's depressing to be reminded of the ugliness of power when used badly.  This unfortunately applies to all races, ages, segments, religions, whatever.",1476921600,,524,4.612903225806452

3981034,4,B002SJIO5O,"Good, but intense. Very violent. Sharlto Copley is a very good actor. As someone else commented, the major irony of the film is how Wikus becomes more humane as he becomes less human. Very obvious commentary on racism, and it's a pity that we humans can feel sometimes more sympathetic towards a fictional alien than we can toward real humans.

As science fiction goes, it's pretty good, too, although it uses themes that have been explored quite often in scifi. I like the ending, the rather prosaically-asked question about whether the aliens will come back to effect a rescue of their kin, or to declare war on humans. I don't like the rather silly bit of an alien (presumably Wikus) crafting a metal flower for his wife Tania. That gives the feeling that he is somehow accepting of his new condition and everything is hunky-dory and coming up roses. It feels false to the ideas and events of the film.",1473552000,,905,4.65625

You can tell that Chappie and Elysium are set within the same world and timeline.  It seems that the order would be District 9, then Chappie, and finally Elysium.  But that's just my opinion, lol.

3981075,1,B002SJIO5O,"If you are a 20 yr old male into bloody video games you will love this piece of junk. But OH mercy, that was the stupidest movie ever. It was a merge of abuse-type issues with computer graphics generated machines and weird aliens all mushed up into a stupid VERY predictable plot with a dialog that included the F-word every 3 second. It would have, at least, helped if the characters used other foul language than the word of choice. This movie works better as a video game but it flops on the big screen. Waste of time and money! It was SO STUPID......

For example, why the heck would the family of the main character continue with their surprise party for him when he comes into his home obviously in pretty bad shape; Oh no, the family just continues on with ""cut the cake honey"" kinds of dialogue. You know, if it's a documentary, then the sense of ""realness"" is lost by scenes such as the one above. And it's like this the entire movie. Also, I did not see 1 million aliens around; I guess the movie budget just could not afford to show them all, so you see maybe a dozen at a time, a dozen human-army guys all acting like Rambo, and it just makes zero sense. And the ending, what the heck? I can't comment on it cause I will give the movie away. But if you are curious about the ending, you will have to sit through a good 2.5 hours of boring absurdity.

The last half hour's action and denouement make up for the first two-thirds starring and irritating and unsympathetic main character (who eventually develops into a satisfying anti-hero). Not your typical science fiction flick, this one has a hidden moral message, particularly when viewed with the refugee crisis unfolding in Europe and the USA. The CGI'd aliens are pretty interesting and display a wide range of emotions and behavior. Most of the human characters don't compare very favorably to the aliens. The South African flavor of the locale, dialogue and cultural references is a nice overlay on what can best be described as an UNSETTLING story.

I had just watched Amelie, which I consider to be a masterpiece, the night before I tried to watch this.  I just don't get this movie.  I think I can appreciate maybe the larger themes that the film makers were striving for, but I found the movie unwatchable.  And forgive my sexism, but this is a movie for men.  It is grotesquely violent, for one thing.  And the tableau of the movie is one of an occupied military state.  I also had trouble understanding if the film maker was going for sort of a ""This is Spinal Tap"" grotesquely absurd and humorous spoof, or for something actually to be taken seriously.  Perhaps if I were a member of the target audience, I wouldn't have to ask this question.

3981164,5,B002SJIO5O,"Fresh, Original SF Story

I've never seen anything like it, and what I saw was a delightful, fresh story about aliens stuck on a planet they had not intended to visit.  Major kudos to the whole movie team for telling a difficult story, shot through with human insight and sensitivity, set in the political hotbed of Johannesburg, South Africa, without succumbing to a political agenda.

Weta Digital continued its firmly established track record of producing special effects so outstanding that they are completely invisible.  Those aliens are _real_; you'll have to watch the production clips to confirm otherwise.  This was after they did King Kong (2005) but before Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011).

The film was produced by Peter Jackson's Wingnut team, with credits for Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens.  (I will confess that it was because of their names and of course Weta Digital that I even noticed the movie.)  It was director Neill Blomkamp's first feature film, and even allowing for the fact that he stood on the shoulders of these titans of the modern film industry, he did an outstanding job.

It was also the first feature film for the star, Sharlto Copley, but you'd never be able to tell that he was a rookie from his performance in District 9.  His Wilkus van der Merwe character is as polished and believable (even in such an outlandish setting) as anything you'll see coming from Hollywood.

Of course, there's always something to whine about.  The ending is somewhat satisfying, but the film stops short of the complete story, leaving unresolved plot elements open.  That was a disappointment, but not quite enough to take away a star from the rating.

The basic plot element of a big defense company wanting to use alien DNA so they can make the aliens work is really implausible.  Putting on my aerospace engineer hat, I have to note that if you demonstrate to us monkey boys that a system does work and put a working model into our hands, we'll figure out how to build it without need for extraterrestrial DNA to unlock the toys.

But my major whine is aimed at Sony Entertainment's production of the actual DVD; they loaded it down with so many previews that it took 15 minutes just to get to the point where I could view the actual movie.  And what the heck was a Michael Jackson video doing in the startup for ""District 9""?  Maybe they just wanted to show another version of an ugly alien life form, but, seriously, never put an image like that in my had again.",1434585600,,2493,4.665903890160183

3981250,4,B002SJIO5O,"Here is a movie that shows us just how bad racism can be in our society.  Only instead of showing racism between humans, it shows how racist we would be if we ever actually did meet aliens and they came to our planet.

These poor beings are moved into what can only be described as shanty towns and forced to survive off of garbage and government supplied food which is substandard.  Also for some reason they really like cat food.  I don't know why, but that really made me laugh!

The story overall is really good and it makes you think about an racist ideas you have in your own head and makes you took a long look at yourself.  When a movie can do that and show you how some of your own ideas may be wrong and how you should change, that to me is not only entertainment, but it's also helping you grow as a person.

The only way I would improve this would be with more action scenes and maybe a little more on the history and home world of these aliens.

The initial documentary style seemed a little irritating at the time but it didn't last long and introduced the characters and story background effectively - oddly, I didn't notice when it stopped and the 'real film' started.

While the story-line is fairly simple (down-trodden aliens trying to escape human tyranny) the film never lacks pace and the CGI of the aliens is simply incredible - it is definitely the best I've seen. I'm sure there are critics out there who would choose to look at the 'obvious but superficial' South African apartheid parallel but that would be typical of wishy-wash, unimaginative and generally beige thinking so prevalent today.

3981316,2,B002SJIO5O,"What does it take to be funny? The right situation, precise comedic timing, flawless acting? Sure all of
these, but something more. How about the mob mentality? Nothing makes you laugh more at a movie
that a hundred people or so joining you. In Dinner for Schmucks, starring Steve Carell and Paul Ruud,
having an audience laughing with you definitely helps.
Dinner for Schmucks is a remake of a reportedly better executed French film called The Dinner
Game. Tim (played by Ruud) is an upwardly mobile executive who is invited to a special dinner whereby
participants bring well, bring an idiot. The goal is to win the prize for bringing the biggest idiot.
Essentially, this is what will catapult Tim to the seventh floor an envious spot to all his sixth floor
colleagues. Tims girlfriend, Julie (beautifully played by Stephanie Szostak) does not like the idea at all,
and Tim assures her hes not going to participate. But he does. Especially since he just happens to
(literally) run into Barry (played by Carell), a taxidermist who creates 3D vignettes using dead mice.
Clearly what is not always necessary to be funny is a tightly crafted storyline and strong character
development as both are woefully lacking. The story unfolds clumsily to say the least as I found myself
rolling my eyes at the blatant disregard for quality storytelling. About two thirds into the film, when it
became apparent they were actually going to have a dinner scene I rolled my eyes again and whined,
Theyre going to make me sit through a dinner scene?
Carell and Ruud do what they always do in this film--Carell the idiot and Ruud the straight guy, but its
the great support cast that actually makes the film watchable. Zach Galifianakis plays Therman, Carells
boss at the IRS who uses mind control techniques to manipulate people. Jermaine Clement plays Kieran,
an artist who is managed by Ruuds girlfriend; his extreme art and lifestyle get big laughs",1408406400,,1934,4.863636363636363

Is it any wonder the aliens want to escape to their home world after the way they are forced into living in garbage dumps where the only human inhabitants are profiteers and criminals.? The irony of the investigating agent who helps persecute them being infected with their DNA and slowly mutating into a ""prawn"" isn't lost as he now learns exactly how it feels to be on the receiving side of human ""benevolence."" Those in charge, including his own father-in-law, only want to help him in order to gain control of the aliens' weapons since they can only be operated by someone with alien DNA. When he resists, they decide to simply vivisect him and get it that way. He ends up a fugitive, rejected by his wife, pursued by the big business conglomerates who run things, and allying himself with the very creatures he'd been looking down upon only a few days before. The ending is bittersweet and even more of an irony with only a vague promise of his return to normalcy and the question of what will happen if it's achieved.

A little less documentary-style footage at the beginning and more detail given to the relationship between the human and the alien and their fight for freedom would've been appreciated. (I was looking forward to the agent actually getting on the abandoned mothership and what might happen there.) Nevertheless what is shown is perhaps the core of the story though he's accepted rather quickly considering his recent enmity toward the prawns.

It;s a disturbing film in more ways than one. Thought-provoking and emotional and perhaps a little more hypothetically truth than I'd like to believe.",1406419200,,1737,4.825503355704698

This movie of course is excellent.  The quality of the image and sound are excellent.
What prompted me to do this review was the frustration I felt I trying to navigate this disc.  First you have to sit through a bunch of previews you don't want to see,  then after what seems like 20 minutes you reach the main menu.
Finally in the extras I tried BD live and the chat feature only to be told over and over that I was not connected to the internet, although I was.  The one that drove me crazy is called ""Interactive Map"".  Nothing worked here, and I could not get out of the feature.  I was forced to eject the disc and start over!  I was crazy enough to try this again.  I just stopped myself as I was about to frisbee the disc out the window.

A Cheery, enthusiastic, non- threatening sort of guy. Then you slowly watch his job and realize he is burecratic, callous, manipulative, and not likable at all. Quickly I found myself cheering for the aliens, much like a PETA fanatic would cheer for the bull in Spain who kills the matador.

3981324,4,B002SJIO5O,"Watching this movie a few years after its release, I have to wonder why it got Oscar nominations for Best Picture and Best Director. The special effects are truly Gandalfian. The handheld cameras and TV-style interviews jolt and immerse you into this future world so that it becomes credible very quickly. My problem is that, as the story progresses, these handheld cameras record scenes, such as the adult alien conversing in private with the child alien, they wouldn't be able to record in real life. The handheld cameras and the astounding special effects quickly become more of a gimmick and cheapen the movie's overall effect.

Viewers also compared this movie to Kafka's Metamorphosis and Cronenberg's The Fly. Those comparisons were misguided. Gregor Samsa's metamorphosis was symbolic of how he felt about his inner self. The ""metamorphosis"" in this movie is more of an accident. Cronenberg's Seth Brundle was also the victim of an accident, but Cronenberg craftily transformed Brundle's experience into a commentary on human mortality. If anything, the message of District 9 is that universal values of love and friendship transcend social, racial, and intergalactic boundaries. Kafka and Cronenberg give us deeply considered pessimism; the makers of District 9 give us a shallow dose of optimism beneath all the brightly-colored slam-bang effects.",1405555200,,1357,5.370892018779343

It was oddly coincidental that around the time of the filming and release of this movie, thousands upon thousands of Zimbabweans fleeing persecution, disease, unemployment and hunger were pouring into South Africa and Botswana across the border and the Zimbabweans were being treated very similar to the so-called ""Prawns"" in this movie. What I took away from this movie was the overall lack of compassion, racial harmony, social justice and togetherness in human society. It cuts deep, because scenes like this movie has portrayed has existed and continues to exist throughout the world in just about every nation.

3981344,5,B002SJIO5O,"So I saw Elysium, like, I don't know... maybe a year ago? Hated it.  Only upside was Matt Damon who always makes something good. Everything else....?

Too Rushed. Too many f-bombs for my taste (yeah, I can withstand a lot). Paper-thin characters. Too much convenience for our ""heroes"". And an irritating Obamacare social message. Another thing I should mention is that I found Sharlto Copley's speech utterly unintelligible. Sorry, but it's true. I'm not gonna lie here.
So yeah, I don't know what was wrong with Neill Blomkamp, but he lost it for that film...

... so when I saw that this starred Sharlto Copley and was directed/written by Neill Blomkamp, I thought. ""Alright, let's give a try (but put the subtitles on and prepare yourself)"".

Let me just say that the story and the unconventional approach of it's telling is phenomenal... (Prepare for a good read *wink wink*)

... near Johannesburg, South Africa a massive space ship stalls in the sky and doesn't move. It remains still. At first the country (along with the rest of the world) is startled, but time continues to move on. Nothing happens. Nothing comes out. Finally, the government sends people to break into the vessel and see what is inside. What's inside surprises everyone in the movie (though not necessarily the viewers). Aliens, of course. Giant crustacean-like humanoids... and they are helpless and malnourished. Trying to help, the governments of the world create a home for the creatures on the far outskirts of Johannesburg called District 9. But what was originally a righteous effort quickly begins to turn into a terrible atrocity.

20 years pass by and things have turned sour. Very Sour.

We then meet Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a friendly-if-selfish man who works with a questionable organization called MNU, which acts as a sort of crossover between a peacekeeping force/research corporation. Over the course of those twenty years, the South African people have become fed up with these ""prawns"" and want them to be taken away. They breed like crazy. They destroy things for sport. Are sort of aggressive - resulting in human deaths. And cost way too much to care for. In response to the country's pleas, MNU sends Wikus and a large team of people to relocate the ""prawns"" to a newer, ""better"" home. During the brutal and inhumane procedure, an accident happens to Wikus which changes his life forever...

Let's talk about this amazing movie...

CHARACTERS - Right off the bat I'm gonna say that Sharlto Copley absolutely captured me with his acting. He was incredible, and thankfully, due to subtitles and a not-so-strong accent, I could listen and understand the tragic character he plays in this story. And he really is the primary character of this film. Certainly the only important one that is human. When and if you watch this film, you'll probably agree that he's incredibly selfish and cruel with the choices he makes. That he's doing really bad things at first. And yes... he is. And I'm also certain we would too if in his shoes. Many have before in some ways. IS he morally-dubious? Yeah. But we all are. Yes, ALL of us. We all make selfish, ignorant choices from time to time. That's what a human does, and he is perfectly human...
And that's one thing I really liked about this film. At first, I was so certain it would be an Avatar-story. A tale of a man who falls in love with the lovable aliens (not so lovable in this film) and courageously does the righteous thing in betraying his race to save them. But instead, we are presented with a character who doesn't really care about the aliens - and we never really find out if he changes his heart in the end. We are presented with a character that puts himself and his relationship with his wife above that of everything else... and, like a REAL human, his survival and happiness becomes his obsession once he's cornered and endangered.

THEMES - Another thing I thought they'd do is the ""evil aliens come down to enslave humanity"" plotline which is way too overdone.
I was completely wrong; it isn't the aliens that are the ""evil aliens"" here. Once the film was complete, I sat down and just thought about it a little... thinking of similar things that have happened in history. The way differences between cultures and ways of life SO often leads to hate, discrimination and atrocities. You name it... The Armenian Genocide, American Slavery, The Crusades, The Holocaust, but most importantly perhaps... The Indian Wars.
Believing that we were destined to possess this land of America (the Manifest Destiny), and with the false justification that these people were savages and uncivilized, we Americans expanded westward... forcing the Indians (actually Native Americans) to accommodate us. Often it resulted in both war and extermination.
But just as we weren't righteous, neither were the Indians - they, too, committed their own atrocities - and this movie reflects that in showing that the aliens aren't any less human than we. (Excuse me if that sounds like an oxymoron)

EMOTION - Those two above are the big strong points for this film really. I usually rate those movies that elicit emotion from me as good movies - because that's usually a sign that I've become attached to the characters and their stories. Well, I certainly felt that way about this film. One scene involving a phone, Wikus, and his wife is extremely moving and gut-wrenching. The pain and confusion on Copley's face is real! His phrases and lines sound painful. His mannerisms seem SO human. Did it make me cry? No. But it tightened my throat a bit.
You also feel both hate and a bit of disgust as you see what MNU does in reaction to the tragic events that change Wikus's life. Instead of helping him, they try to benefit from him. Doesn't that sound a lot like business and government these days? It's all about the money. Human life and happiness comes after the dough.
When you see the soldiers shooting these aliens and you catch the grins and smiles on their faces you wanna strike them... yet you also recall similar grins and smiles on the faces of those SS soldiers that tortured and killed over half a billion Jews, right? Or what about the racism that effects so many societies? Racist comments are oftentimes accompanied by a grin or a smile.

Another thing I should mention is the sympathy you feel for the aliens believe it or not! One thing I found to be both similar and totally different about this movie and Avatar (let's face it, there's a lot of similarity) was the way the aliens were portrayed. Yes, both have aliens and evil humans reigning over them, but whereas in Avatar we have a perfect race of peaceful righteous creatures that always do the right thing... here we have aliens that aren't exactly pretty, aren't exactly perfect, that don't really have pleasant customs or habits, and definitely react the way a human would react. Whereas I found it a little difficult to actually sympathize with the Na'vi in Avatar... the ""prawns"" here are handled in a way that would elicit sympathy.

Note - I'm also pleased to say that the aliens here aren't corny like SO many interpretations are. Even the alien language fits right in and doesn't feel like a rip-off from some foreign dialect.

So ultimately, this movie is absolutely fantastic. The story of Wikus and the carefully and intricately-placed social commentary fit in together so masterfully that it's quite seamless. Are there any plotholes and rushed things? Maybe, but I wasn't really looking out for them as the story enraptured me from the moment it started. And speaking of ""started"", the way that it began was extremely innovative and kinda risky. Thankfully they pulled it off. you'll know what I mean when you watch it.

If there are any criticisms I'd make on this film... it'd be the constant f-bombs that seem characteristic to films done by Neill Blomkamp and the lack of any complicated opponents. It's always the tough, Gestapo-like soldier that is bent on evil... as well as the power-hungry business official or politician. I'm in need of something a little new than that.
And about those f-bombs... now I don't usually cringe at foul language. I have a very high-language tolerance. No, I don't like it or condone it. But that's not why it's a criticism of mine. The reason it bugs me is that it so often distracts from the story and the plot, especially when there is little or no cohesive plot in the first place (Elysium)... plus it just sounds a little irritating when every other word is f***. But the story is incredible, which is why I can overlook it.
Another thing I should mention is that this film is NOT for kids. I think I made that obvious with the above. Perhaps for mature kids like me. But not for those that would be creeped, traumatized or easily influenced. There is foul language, suggestive content and lots of gore. Plus, the underlying theme needs to be grasped to really ""get it"". It's R rated for a reason...

Personally, I don't think this movie warrants the criticism it's received. Only an average rating of four stars? Yeah, it's science fiction and has a social message. but this is no liberal-agenda campaign masquerading as a movie. It's leaps and bounds over that Blomkamp's recent film. We have something close to literary here, folks. And what does that mean exactly? Well, it definitely means you won't be seeing this movie over and over for fun. It wasn't exactly a fun film to me. Sure there were funny parts (albeit rather scarce). Instead it makes you think and question things... about yourself and history. About hate and intolerance and the evil of it. Does that mean we have to love EVERYTHING about everybody? Believe EVERY religion. Accept EVERY quirk? No. But it does mean that you treat them like you would yourself, no matter what oddities they practice or what they look like (skin color included).

P.S. I kinda feel like I'm missing something in this review, so please leave comments... and PLEASE like my review!",1398124800,2,10011,4.780798149219202

The very narrowly aimed critique of a localized political system would have communicated to more people if it had been broadened.  Instead, I got little out of it because I could not relate to the characters or the circumstances.  The aliens themselves while visually stunning, gave the impression their intelligence, culture and technology was conceived by four-year-olds.

A few that come to mind:
 Wikus really looks retarded at the beginning of the movie. Why would they give him command over the whole operation?
 Why would a substance that is supposed to fuel a space ship have the side-effect of changing the DNA of a human being and turn him into a prawn?
 How did humans manage to subdue the prawns when they are so strong and have such advanced weaponry?
 There is a lot of emphasis on the squalid conditions that the prawns were living in, all that display of meat, dirt, lack of sophistication, etc... A little bit hard to believe for a civilisation with such advanced technology.

3981399,5,B002SJIO5O,"I want to focus on some features of this movie that intrigue me, without giving away too much of the plot for readers who might not have seen the movie.  First of all is the humor. Some of this is satirical.  For example, the idea of a group of humans going to an alien concentration camp (for that is in effect what District 9 is) to get aliens who look like giant shellfish to sign documents agreeing to their eviction is on its face funny, and the movie doesn't shy away from presenting some of the interactions with the aliens in that way.  The protagonist, Wikus van der Merwe, is so gung-ho and determined to be good-naturedly effective in his job of getting the signatures that you almost have to laugh.  And the naive good nature he shows is perhaps why his father-in-law, who obviously dislikes him, has tapped him for the job of overseeing the evictions and relocation to another camp further from Johannesburg -- he expects him to fail or do badly and perhaps diminish him in the eyes of his wife, whom he adores and who seems to love him in return.  But the broader humor comes later, when Wikus has formed an alliance with an alien called Christopher Jones (that's funny too), and man and prawn prepare to do battle -- and in fact battle rather well -- against the mercenary forces arrayed against them after the authorities have decided that Wikus has in effect ""gone native.""  This is the odd-couple aspect -- they like each other (and need each other too), and like Butch and Sundance, or more closely, Han Solo and Chewbacca, there is a wonderful scene of them running through a hail of bullets untouched, just as the good guys did in the old westerns.  The fact that Christopher is a man-sized prawn with legs makes it all the funnier.  There's also humor in the scene where the superstitious Nigerian arms-dealer who has set up shop in the camp wants to eat Wikus's arm.

All of this shows the director Neill Blomkamp's confidence in his control of tone.  The real triumph of the movie, in terms of its relation to the audience, is how gradually we come to root for the aliens (and Wikus), for they are really initially quite repulsive, with their slimy, snaky-tendrilled faces and their reliance on cat food, consumed straight from the can, as a staple.  But we get used to them, and we can't get away from the fact that there's something xenophobic about the authorities' hassling them.  In particular, the mercenary Koobus Venter, who is called on to eliminate Wikus and who takes such obvious pleasure in killing.  Wikus does a good deal of killing himself, albeit in self-defense, but his ""Come and get me"" attitude to authorities we have every reason to distrust, doesn't dwell so much on gore as on Wikus's lone-cowboy attitude.  The guys he gets have it coming, we feel, and Blomkamp is careful not to individualize them.

A sentimental feature of the movie, without which it perhaps couldn't work, is that the aliens turn out to be not so alien after all.  They care for each other; Christopher obviously cares for his child, who is as cute as only a little prawn can be -- but who knows how to deal with some sophisticated gadgetry.  And that's another thing -- the aliens are highly intelligent too.  What they lack to get out of their predicament is a certain liquid with which to reactivate their ship.  How that liquid is recovered is the main focus of the action-packed center of the movie.  The emotional core of the movie is focused in a brief scene in a pause in that action, when, in a laboratory basement where the liquid has been stored, Christopher finds the corpses of aliens who have obviously been subject to experimentation.  (We learn later that the authorities are trying to isolate the DNA that will enable them to perhaps activate the alien weaponry, which can only be used by aliens).  Christopher is, so to speak, unmanned by what he sees in that lab -- and the audience feels for him, despite his obvious ""otherness.""  But that's because by that point the other doesn't seem so other.  Much to the director's credit, that political implication is never explicit in the movie, but it's the source of its power to move us and engage us.  I recommend this movie -- get over the initial shock of creepy-crawly faces, and be surprised.",1385164800,,4282,4.610013175230566
3981400,3,B002SJIO5O,The product was as described and manufactured to better than expected quality. I would recommend it to anyone looking for something like this.,1384992000,,142,5.217391304347826
3981401,5,B002SJIO5O,"To anyone who may read this: I am going to discuss the movie in its entirety, so spoiler alert.

District 9 is a great movie with very complex characters. Initially, we are introduced to a humanoid species (referred to as prawns for their arthropodal appearance) from another planet who are portrayed as stupid, repulsive, violent, purposeless, and diseased among other things. To save the day is the naive Wikus van de Merwe, whose job it is to lead the relocation of over one million aliens. Right away, we see Wikus' inability as a leader and as an assertive figure in general. His position is a clear product of nepotism and his control over his subordinates is essentially nonexistent. Moreover, Wikus is shown to be incredibly stupid. However, once Wikus is exposed to a fluid that begins to transform him into a prawn, the audience is exposed to a suddenly morphed view of both the prawns and the humans. The documentary styled-film cuts to interviews in which people discuss the true intentions of MNU, the company leading the relocation of the prawns. Alien technology and weapons are shown to be incredibly powerful though inoperable by humans. MNU is shown to be a company willing to torture and murder individuals (humans and aliens alike) for the ability to harness alien technology and thus make financial gains. Simultaneously, the audience is introduced to Christopher Johnson, a prawn who is peaceful, intelligent, caring, and an overall good ""person"". Halfway through the movie, the ability to classify aliens and humans as good and bad is lost entirely. Contradictions of this manner are the key method of provoking thought about how humans generalize one another that is utilized in this film.

The film also draws striking parallels with current and historical events. The most obvious being the treatment of blacks and other non-white racial groups in South Africa during the time of apartheid. For over fifty years, the white population of South Africa was in charge of every aspect of the country and tried to separate the country by race. They felt themselves superior and demanded separation from non-whites in every way. Similarly, the humans of the film find living among the aliens burdensome and ban them from all human-inhabited areas. In fact, the humans put up signs around Johannesburg specifically to isolate prawns from human-only areas exactly like whites put up white-only signs around South Africa during the apartheid era. The abject conditions of the prawns are reflective of the conditions of refugees as well, and the place where they are forcibly placed - district 9 - is even referred to as a refugee camp. As such, the film explores the extremely poor conditions of refugees, specifically when Wikus is forced to spend his first night in District 9. I believe it is at this point that Wikus begins to understand the plights of the prawn, demonstrated symbolically through his increased transformation into an alien. The film uses this to make the commentary that people do not understand the lives of others until fully immersing themselves into the other person's life. These are just two examples of the film's attempt to connect people to the lives of the abject. District 9 shows that in fact, these individuals are no different from us, but subsequently reveals the unfortunate truth that humans are limited in their ability to empathize until being placed in the same conditions. On top of being a revealing insight into human limitation, District 9 is also an awesome movie.",1384905600,,3527,5.017064846416382
3981402,4,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is definitely a must-see film! Neill Blomkamp does a wonderful job setting Johannesburg as the site of an alien introduction to the world. He really does incorporate real-life facets of South African life into the film in a way, I think only a true South African can. In my opinion it really is the little nuances and details that really allows a non-South African viewer, such as myself a glimpse into the world of South Africa. The cinematography and animation in District 9 are also on point. First of all, only one actor, Jason Cope, played every single ""prawn"" in the movie and Christopher Johnson's son is actually 100 percent computer generated which just blows my mind that that is even possible to use a computer to generate such a real-life looking object with real-looking movements and reactions and everything. Also, the animators were able to actually generate the animations even when the shaky cam was being used to film which proves some real talent on their parts. It really just goes to show how much technology has advance since animation began.

Another interesting idea explored in the film is the fact instead of the aliens' spaceship landing in a big city like New York, London, or Tokyo, the ship landed over 1980s Johannesburg, South Africa. Johannesburg, for the rest of the word, is not a very relevant city but obviously the reason for the movie's setting is to introduce the theme of apartheid with which, again, Blomkamp succeeds. The distinctions that he makes between the humans and the prawns is almost identical as that between whites and black in South Africa during the apartheid era. Overall, this movie is fantastic and it really should go down as one the classics in time for film.",1384819200,,1732,4.831649831649831

At time, it actually bludgeons you so hard that when you catch yourself wondering ""How can people be so insensitive and downright cruel to these CG aliens!"" you also scowl at how quickly you relate it to issues of racism and poverty throughout our own history -- and present.

In terms of watchability, there isn't much that will shock you about this film, although it is not quite as formulaic as you may expect. The effects are at times passable, and at other times VERY good. My disbelief was never fully suspended, but it doesn't take you too far out of the story.

3981437,4,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is a semi-expansion of Blomkamps short Alive in Joburg. Like that short, District 9 is very clearly a meditation of sorts on South Africas apartheid. Based somewhat on the real life District 6 in Cape Town, District 9 is the seemingly unending ghetto of aliens that have been forced into appalling conditions with no end of misery in sight.

It's something George Orwell, or H.G. Wells, might have written in their heyday. Certainly the screenwriters lose a little focus towards the very end of the picture, where this quasi-pseudo- documentary cam political allegory morphs into a Michael Bay type clone, but mostly this is smart, evocative filmmaking that manages to put real human emotion up on the screen alongside humor, imagination, action/adventure, social commentary, attention to detail, and amazing special effects, all in deftly managed amounts.

A note on special effects, the prawns are so well integrated into the piece that it's hard to tell--or even notice--that they're computer generated, not a man in a shrimp suit. And speaking of a man in a suit, Copley is no less than amazing in his formative feature-length role, a bumbling Borat, Dutch- style by way of John Connor.

District 9 does have its flaws, it can be a bit obvious and heavy handed, but its also a visually spectacular science fiction film that cares about its characters, and thats something that can be overlooked in these type of films today.",1377648000,2,1439,4.9875
3981438,5,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is a new kind of sci-fi with a surprising delivery drawing as it does on a political and sociological allegory of the apartheid system in South Africa and the aftermath. Good sci-fi tunnels into present topics and concerns,fleshing itself out with ideological meat. First the idea of aliens as not invaders, occupiers or overlords but immigrant underdogs herded into sprawling slums on the outskirts of Johannesburg. The use of news channel reports and shakey docu footage to loosen up and make familiar the somewhat incredible idea of a stranded alien spaceship that is far from its mother planet and fleet,forced to hover above the South African townships due to lack of fuel for the last 2 decades. The image of these aliens downgraded as`prawns' with half humanoid,half invertebrate features further adds a spoof,comical effect until one realizes they stand for the displacement of refugees,asylum seekers. Their way of speaking is effective and almost believable.

Included in this are the Nigerian black marketers,gunrunners, who along with private corporation Multi-National United(MNU), are exploiting the aliens. The non-humans are found starving after humans burn through the walls of their spaceship,then quickly confined to an area called District 9, a makeshift refugee camp they must not leave under any circumstances. Despite being monitored by MNU's agency, the extraterrestrials begin to break the rules,leaving the confines of the camp,committing crimes and clashing with the authorites. The human population begins to feel increasingly threatened by the visitors-and resentful of the money being spent on maintaining District 9. These `immigrants' are treated like the segregated natives under apartheid.

The masterstroke is to have the middle manager,Wikus Van der Merwe(Copley), portrayed as a nave,self-satisfied comic fool who is responsible for leading MNU in the township clear-out. They must be evacuated to a more isolated area. Wikus is infected by a spill from an alien object while searching a homestead and his DNA gradually becomes morphed(shades of The Fly).His arm becomes claw-like..He becomes hunted, captured and experimented upon as he is able to fire the aliens' weapons. They are literally about to harvest his body parts so they can develop the alien weaponry themselves, by using his DNA. Before the operation he escapes and is pursued like a fugitive. He allies himself with the alien Christopher and his son who have collected fuel to get back to the main ship to alter his DNA to what it was. Wikus due to his vulnerability and suffering enlists our sympathy as do the alien survivors.

There follows a more conventional shoot-out as he gets into an exoskeleton machine and the hidden ship under the ground takes off lifting to the mothership. This film is grounded in such historical facts as `the group areas act' which enabled government agents to forcibly remove entire towns using force and intimidation,even the symbol of an alien crossed-out sign takes us back to `whites only', plus the fact there was a `District 6' slum area. I can't praise this film enough for its mastery and low budget techniques and being good sci-fi and avoiding Hollywood. Be thankful there are no stars in this film and the indie methods of filming make it so refreshing. Maybe the future of the cinema rests outside of America in lands far,far away. I think I walked away with a smile on my face thinking director Blomkamp pulled this off through talent alone and his main actor Sharlto Copley (one to watch for) and the fact it was South Africa (not America or Europe) where the aliens landed. The aliens are depicted as a race of dislocated beings who earn our sympathy. The distribution was helped because it was produced by Peter Jackson.

The story and themes in both films has been done to death, but District 9 manages to do it in a way that does not feel so clich.  They both have amazing special effects.  However, District 9 produced great effects with a much smaller budget.  The main character, Wikus (Sharlto Copley), while I do not like him much at first, does not feel like the stereotypical hero like Sam Worthington's character in Avatar does and he feels more real.  I bought his plight more and his transition from a nave person to liking the aliens feels natural.  Plus the film is very violent which makes the action more exciting for me.  I definitely recommend this film, but I would caution in letting your children view it.  The film is very dark and not for everyone.",1375747200,,965,4.629411764705883
3981449,5,B002SJIO5O,"May contain spoilers.

With director Neill Blomkamp's ""Elysium"" nearly upon us I thought I would go back and look at this earlier effort.  This was one of my favorite films of 2009 and earned an Oscar nomination as well.  Not bad for a young South African filmmaker in his first feature.

District 9 is a hell-hole slum where extraterrestrial beings are corralled in Johannesburg.  For reasons unknown, their giant spaceship hovers above the city with no violent intent and when finally approached, the authorities found it contained sick and dying creatures.  They look like the dudes from ""Predator"" but on a strict diet.  Called ""prawns"" by the humans, the aliens are hounded, prodded, teased and worse.

As their numbers grow, the government decides to move them away from the city into another more rural area.  The man in charge for the assignment is an unlikely civilian supervisor named Wikus Van e Merwe (a remarkable first time performance by Blomkamp's good friend Sharlto Copley).  Confident, but uneasy of the assignment, Wikus and his group must go door to door to tell the ""prawns"" they must move.  In one attempt, the event becomes physical and Wikus accidentally sprays himself with a black oily substance found in one of the shacks.  Over time this becomes serious as Wikus begins to take on physical features of the aliens.  Eventually he is used as a test subject to see if he can activate and fire the alien's weapons.  He can.

The film begins as a documentary, even using the faux news reports to authenticate the events.  As the film moves forward, the film become more action oriented as Wikus must evade the authorities and ultimately help the aliens leave Earth.  Blomkamp, who also co-wrote the script with his girlfriend Terri Tatchell, has created a rare thinking man's (or woman's) sci-fi classic.  The story has political and satirical significance as the aliens certainly have much in common with South Africa's apartheid history.  But the movie is also a balls-to-the-wall action thriller.

The Blu ray disc compliments the 5 star movie with 5 star production qualities.  Using a 1080p resolution the film has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio as does the theatrical version.  I could find fault nowhere with the picture quality.  Some of the early scenes are shot using the digital handheld cameras that are used in many documentaries.  The later scenes are perfectly presented.  Check out the beard stubble on close ups.  The quality of the creature make-up is  shown as well.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio and is in a word perfect.  I use a couple 12"" subs in my system and they got a workout without being overly done.  Subtitles come in English and English SDH as well as French and Hindi. There are numerous extras.  Refer to Amazon's description above for a list.",1375488000,,2796,4.872611464968153

3981451,5,B002SJIO5O,"This is one of those ""signpost"" films - it's significant in being one of the first of it's kind that's unabashedly not US-focused (set in South Africa), filmed in a gritty, realistic, news footage / documentary style; and for focusing less on what the aliens are, where they came from, or why they are here, and more on the (relative to the preceding questions) mundane issue of literally what would people do with 1MM stranded alien refugees. Specifically, it focuses on how human society would almost assuredly do the wrong thing at every opportunity, while lying and covering up the truth. A sci-fi political drama. Plus the effects and action are top notch. Great stuff.

More films are now spending less of the limited story telling time explaining how their particular sci-fi universe came to be the way it is, and more time focusing on a specific and compelling sub-story within that universe.",1375142400,,900,4.882352941176471

3981453,3,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is a modern E.T. with guns and computer rendered aliens. The story is deceptively simple, a growing friendship between a human and the alien ends up with the human sacrificing much to save the alien and send E.T. home. The genre is more Action than E.T.'s Drama as the main escape plot encounters some pretty interesting obstacle and the gory nature of these E.T.s and the human's transformation into an E.T. provides enough tension and intrigue to keep the tight story very engaging.

Pretty awesome.

The filmmaking is very interesting too, with some documentary style scenes to move the plot along. Very different and engaging. The choice of locale (South Africa) and a weird accent with an unknown lead actor make the story easier to believe (like how some foreign films can get away with really cheesy lines and be very impactful because our social filters don't detect the foreign language cheese: like a lot of Anime (Naruto) or some South Korean romcoms (My Sassy Girl)).

Love everything about it except that it can be hard for me to understand what everybody is saying. I can't put subtitles on my TV because it is HDTV and Comcast doesn't allow that option. Buying the DVD would solve that problem. The main character (Shartlo) is excellent. From what I have read on IMDB he wasn't even an actor and even adlibs things when he is doing his newscast. The scenery is really dramatic and depressing at times. The language of the ""prawns"" is really cool especially since one person does all the voices. I really don't want to comment too much on the plot because I don't want to spoil any surprises. I hope they make a sequel. I think it is an underrated movie. Very complex cultural clash. I also like the undertones of socially injustice with the aliens. Government cover-up is also rampant. This movie is more than just an alien scare. The CGI is great and works well with the characters. It isn't your typical jump out and scare you type of aliens but there are a few scenes that will make you flinch. There is some bad language (but it fits with the situation). I would recommend turning on subtitles if you have the DVD.

The rave reviews and brilliant marketing campaign only added to the mystery and so I did what I seldom do: I went to the theater. And the experience was unforgettable.

Viewing it multiple times at home has only increased my appreciation for the structure this movie follows. Both the humans and prawns are shown in realistic detail, with good and bad characters on both sides. There's certainly social commentary lurking beneath the surface but it never comes across as preachy or heavy-handed, making repeated viewings even more beneficial.

3981467,5,B002SJIO5O,"""District 9"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Thirty years ago, aliens made first contact with Earth. Humans waited for the hostile attack, or the giant advances in technology. Neither came. Instead, the aliens were refugees, the last survivors of their home world. The creatures were set up in a makeshift home in South Africa's District 9 as the world's nations argued over what to do with them.

Now, patience over the alien situation has run out. Control over the aliens has been contracted out to Multi-National United (MNU), a private company uninterested in the aliens' welfare -- they will receive tremendous profits if they can make the aliens' awesome weaponry work. So far, they have failed; activation of the weaponry requires alien DNA.

The tension between the aliens and the humans comes to a head when an MNU field operative, Wikus van der Merwe, contracts a mysterious virus that begins changing his DNA. Wikus quickly becomes the most hunted man in the world, as well as the most valuable -- he is the key to unlocking the secrets of alien technology. Ostracized and friendless, there is only one place left for him to hide: District 9.

The cast led by Sharlto Copley (in an impressive performance as Wikus) is great! The directing by Neill Blomkamp (who also co-wrote the screenplay) is great! The screenplay by Blomkamp & Terri Tatchell is great!

The music by Clinton Shorter is excellent! The cinematography by Trent Opaloch is excellent! The film editing by Julian Clarke is great! The casting by Denton Douglas is great! The production design by Philip Ivey (who also did the art direction to the ""Lord Of The Rings Trilogy"" (2001, 2002, & 2003) (which was produced, written and directed by this film's producer, Peter Jackson) is excellent! The art direction by Emilia Roux is excellent! The set decoration by Guy Potgieter is excellent!

3981470,2,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is the sort of film that sits just on the edge of being remembered as a great science fiction classic, but sits far below dozens of better sci-fi movies of the recent and distant past. Personally I was expecting a lot more. Being aware of the basic story before I saw it, and knowing Peter Jackson's name was attached to this film had me hoping that at some point our mistreated aliens would take up arms against the humans and mount a massive battle. The film opens the door to this possibility but it never happens. As it turns out one human and one alien would be the only ones fighting any sort of heroic battle against this oppression. Also in the middle of all this are a small handful of African rebels who are heroes to no one but their own cause, and who would kill humans and aliens alike. When the gun battles begin it ends up that the only heroes in the film might be the gentle alien and his son, who attempt to regain control of a special black fluid that can be used to fuel a small craft which can get them back to their mother ship floating miles above the slums they have been forced to live in. The remaining human helps them much of the film for the sake of his own life, knowing that the aliens have a way to help save him before it's too late. You keep rooting that he will do the right thing, and he finally does do the right thing. But when the battle begins I wondered where all the hundreds of thousands of aliens living in these small shanty town shacks were. They were nowhere to be seen. Were they all hiding in their little shacks? I mean the streets were empty except for government sanctioned special troops and the hunted human and alien they were searching for. This seemed a bit odd to me. None the less District 9 has some impressive special effects and the film is extremely exciting and action packed. There is also a great deal of humor along the way, especially during the first 15 minutes, which at times seems a bit campy and comical. But all gripes aside this film is still hard to ignore, and it was entertaining.

In the early 80's a big alien ship showed up above Johannesburg, South Africa, some aliens came from it and some 28 years later the camp that was set up has basically become the slums of the city called ""District 9"". The aliens nicknamed ""Prawns"" live in terrible conditions and a group called Multi-National United is called in to get rid of the prawns and remove them from these slums. The man in charge is Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley, ""The A-Team"") who really doesn't want to do this, he doesn't have any respect for any of the prawns as evidence by how he treats them when he forces his way into their homes to remove said aliens from said houses.

Well soon after entering the home of a father and son alien household Wikus opens some canister and gets an alien chemical sprayed into his face (why he did such an idiotic act is beyond me), then soon after he begins slowly changing into a prawn. Once he gets outcast into the slums he has to befriend this father and son alien duo, to one try and find a cure, two help them fight back against the military that's ready to invade ""District 9"". In particular a vicious guy who wants to kill all prawns and targets Wikus in particular, which doesn't really lend anymore emotion to the story.

The movie itself is one weird mix, part of it is straight sci-fi which actually is decently well done in a few parts, like when Wikus and the father alien break into a building, but other parts are just silly, the mech suit fight near the end comes to mind. The mock-u-mentary portion is just dumb, trying to present this as actual believable material was not the way to go and quite frankly brought this movie way down and devalued anything good it did. These portions also lended no emotional weight to the characters least of all Wikus who has to be one of the least likeable characters ever, it gets even worse when we're supposed to apparently care about him trying to avoid becoming a prawn and save the father and son (which he fails at, at first, I might add).

I remember honestly being pretty angry while watching this, since it did have potential but was too jumbled and had no emotion behind it. Sure the whole refugee storyline with the aliens might echo some old war movies but those were done far, far better than ""District 9"". I can see why people like this flick which is more than fine, I just couldn't get into it and came really close to hating it. *1/2 out of 4 stars.",1367107200,5,2462,4.416299559471366

I will say that this movie was absolutely painful to watch.  I felt gripped by it, and who doesn't like a gripping movie, but it was painful to sit through.  The reflections of the worst parts of human nature, and the viscerality of the film gave me knots.  But how could I not give this movie an ecstatic five star?

3981476,5,B002SJIO5O,"This is one of the more interesting and imaginative films I have seen in my recent tour of more or less current, more or less science fiction, movies. Somewhat to my surprise the television news approach combined with the 'seeing it as it is' element, makes for an exciting reality reported in the impersonal (and, often, necessarily ignorant) mass media manner. The movie-makers and some/many in the audience, may see this as a political parable but I chose to see it as what it purported to be. One does have a choice.
The story pertains to a group of aliens who  have come on a spaceship which ran out of fuel. Entered by representatives of a nation (no real names, please, save that the city was called Johannesburg ) over which the spaceship hovered, the aliens were found starving, but harmless. Over a period of twenty years, they were segregated in one big camp in the City, where they multiplied, were fed and housed by charitable organizations, but gradually became an object of fear and disdain because of their impact on the surrounding city. It was decided to ship them to a new camp well outside the city's borders. The story picks up at this point. that is, with the focus on the officially appointed director of the effort being photographed by movie camera's for  publicity, showing the benign nature of the resettlement. I think it best for me not to go beyond this point, because the story sounds more Wes Craven horror, than the pseudo-realistic movie it is.
Recommendation: For anyone who does not want foul language to be heard by children,  friends or themselves, steer clear. The f...word is much used. For those who like realistic pseudo-science, this production should be enjoyable. For the general viewer, it is more likely to be entertaining than not; many will find the thread continuing interest breaking.",1365984000,,1835,4.819047619047619

Other than the first 20 minutes of plot introduction, there is no mystery, no intrigue, no thought-provoking aspects like a good sci-fi novel would present. Instead, this movie devolved into a blood bath, filled with gratuitous violence and, for me, stomach-turning cruelty.

And then come the plot holes, especially concerning the main character who suddenly knows how to fly an alien ship and operate alien weaponry, all with no explanation as to why...totally unbelievable to me.

The greedy, power hungry father-in-law of the accidentally infected hybrid human man, was total scum for betraying his family (daughter and her husband), to exploit the alien's military technology for his security company's weaponry research & development department. Also, the South African ""person of color - i.e. black"" criminal gang's boss was both comical and pathetic, to think that eating the e.t.'s flesh would give them the ability to activate their acquired alien weapons, to bypass those weapon's security safety measures!

To think that e.t.'s with advanced military technology would possibly not be benevolent but, criminals instead is very depressing! I've always hoped that if first contact were made, that it would be peaceful and remain that way!

 STORY

 In 1982, a giant alien ship grinds to a halt above Johannesburg, South Africa.  The aliens are referred to negatively as ""Prawns"" for their scavenger-like personalities, and are treated like garbage by both the public and government.  The Prawns are forced in a giant slum called District 9, and Multi-National United (MNU) is really interested in getting their hands on the Prawn weapons and engineering them for human use (Prawn weapons won't work on human hands since they're only made to work with Prawns).  Wikus van de Merwe, an MNU manager, is putting up eviction notices for the Prawns into District 10, and comes into contact with Prawn fluid that'll turn him into a Prawn himself.  He's being hunted down by the MNU and has to make a reluctant alliance with a Prawn named Christopher Johnson if he wants any chance to come back to normal.

 CHARACTERS

 For the most part, I thought the characters were done really well.  Of course, the best character is Wikus (Sharlto Copley).  In the beginning, you see him as a mild-mannered jerk (if that makes any sense), and doesn't really care about the Prawns (though he doesn't want Prawns getting killed by MNU troops).  The neat part of Wikus is that his character becomes ""more human"" when his metamorphosis makes him less human, physically-speaking.

 The only character that I would say is closer in line to being the more traditional ""good guy"" would be Christopher Johnson (Jason Cope).  Out of the other human and Prawn characters, he's really the only one who doesn't want to fight, but is forced into combat against the MNU near the end of the movie.

 The antagonists, such as Colonel Koobus Venter (David James) and Obesandjo (Eugene Khumbanyiwa), are good in their roles.  Some may complain that Koobus and Obesandjo lack depth, since they're straight-up maniacs, but I think this works out in their favor since for the former, it would dilute the menacing feeling if he was written to have sympathetic moments.  Koobus's menacing vibe is enhanced with his superb tactical skills when in combat, and while he's not going to rival the Terminator in terms of supervillains, he's quite effective as the cold, murderous maniac.

 However, I wish that some characters, like Wikus's wife, Tania (Vanessa Haywood), would have been developed a little more.

 THEMES/COMMENTARY

 District 9 is noted for having quite a few things to say about humanity.  As stated earlier, with Wikus, his physical transformation into a Prawn makes him more ""human."" Also, this movie takes an interesting stand by showing the aliens in a more sympathetic light than the humans, thought I think the allegories relating to the Apartheid in South Africa are way too obvious.  However, I think Neill Blomkamp did a better job at handling the way the humans and Prawns were handled than James Cameron did the humans and Navi in Avatar, since there was some nuance in the characters in D9 to make them more believable.  I also applaud Blomkamp for pulling off his message without the use of making the Prawns look like eye candy (more on visuals later).

 I also commend Blomkamp for not just portraying the big businesses (MNU) as evil to reflect the ""evils of humanity,"" but also shows it through the Nigerian warlords (headed by Obesandjo) taking advantage of and brutalizing the Prawns for their advanced weapons.

 STORYTELLING

 I thought the way D9 was told was pretty interesting, as it's not everyday that you see a sci-fi film with pretty strong action scenes told as a documentary in the beginning and end like one.  I thought Blomkamp handled the fusion of documentary-styled film and traditional film well, since I thought the transitions were smooth.

 SOUNDTRACK

 Clinton Shorter's music for this movie wasn't bad, though I wouldn't put in the same league of the soundtracks in movies like Blade Runner, The Terminator, or Total Recall.  However, I'll say that Shorter captured the mood of the gritty settings really well with tribal chanting and other musical elements very fitting to the geographical setting.

 CINEMATOGRAPHY

 Trent Opaloch's cinematography for District 9 is quite good.  The cinematography perfectly captures the gritty and violent atmosphere of the Prawns' lives, and I think the idea of it taking place in South Africa is a neat decision, since it's not everyday that you get a sci-fi movie taking place in this part of the world.

 APPEARANCE

 What really struck me in a positive way is the look of the Prawn technology, especially their weapons.  I love how they don't look like totally outlandish guns more akin to a fantasy story in space, but look more like our weapons with a strong ""alien"" visual aesthetic to them.  This also makes them look pretty nasty compared to other alien weapons in sci-fi (such as the Covenant weapons in the Halo games).

 The MNU's personnel and equipment were made perfectly in this movie, since they're a potent military force that also reflects the fact that they're a private military entity. This is reflected in the fact that the personnel have a more ""casual"" look to them than official military personnel and that they don't have access to really powerful weapons like tanks and gunships.

 The looks of the Nigerian warlords were done really well for the movie as well.  They're shown as more ""rag-tag"" through their  dilapidated vehicles and dwellings.

 SPECIAL EFFECTS

 The special effects done by Weta Workshop are marvelous.  The movie combines ""traditional"" special effects with CGI, and you hardly even notice that the effects are, well, effects.  The mutations on Wikus's body are very convincing (these were make-up effects), and the same can be said with how the Prawns look (the Prawns were made by CGI).  I think it's funny that despite the very convincing effects in the movie, the pricetag for them was drastically lower than what was needed to make everything in Avatar.

 ACTION SCENES

 Despite the fact that District 9 is often labeled as an ""action"" movie along with its sci-fi tag, there really isn't that much action that goes on.  However, the action that does take place is done very well.  The movie decides to build up to the action near the end, which I thought was a good thing since it gave them more power.

 I thought the scene where Wikus and Christopher storm the MNU building was awesome, as it showed the two armed with Prawn weapons and dishing out some unique deaths to the MNU mercenaries in the building (such as the arc gun making its targets blow up in a shower of blood).

 The final action scene near the end was pretty amazing.  The MNU and the Nigerian warlords are after Wikus, and donning a Prawn combat exosuit, dishes out some awesome damage against the enemies.  The exosuit even uses a magnetic force to collect all the incoming bullets and uses them as lethal projectiles against those trying to harm Wikus, and even fires a mini bomb into someone's head.  In one scene, he uses the suit's graviton device to pick up a pig and uses it as a projectile against an MNU mercenary. That scene was one of the most unintentionally funny things I've ever seen.  I wish this Prawn exosuit was real, because I'd like to have this thing for home security.

 MATURE CONTENT

 This is not a movie for the kids since there's a good deal of gore and bad language throughout.  There's scenes with both humans and Prawns getting dismembered, blown up, and shot at with plenty of bloodshed.  One of the hardest to watch was actually against a Prawn, since MNU scientists start conducting experiments on Wikus's abilities to interact with Prawn weapons, and Wikus is forced into killing a Prawn with one of the guns (which is highlighted by Wikus begging to shoot at the pig carcasses instead).

 FINAL WORD

 While I wouldn't say that this is quite in the same league of movies like 2001:  A Space Odyssey, Alien, or Total Recall, this was a really solid sci-fi movie.  In terms of sci-fi movies that came out in 2009, this runs rings around Avatar since it had much better character development and storytelling, not to mention better action scenes.

The movie deals with themes we're all familiar with but adds a freshness to the mix by placing a stranded alien race at the heart of the matter. There's lots of gore, lots of profanity, lots of energy, and lots of humour. And the message is thoughtfully constructed: the lead character's dramatic and poignant epiphany is all the more believable because of his conflicted viewpoint.

Director Neill Blomkamp, producer Peter Jackson, and the unknown but extremely talented cast (including Sharlto Copley, who will be starring in Blomkamp's upcoming sci-fi Elysium and Spike Lee's Oldboy remake) crafted a film that is totally original, absolutely ingenious, heartfelt, and action packed.

This entertaining short film was directed by Neill Blomkamp, and was the inspiration to direct District 9. One can indeed see the similarities between the two films.

Interesting fact: The dialogue spoken by most of the ""interviewees"" was unscripted. The filmmakers asked ordinary people what they thought about the refugees living there, and what they said replied was directed at them.",1350950400,2,1124,7.765625

The story is simple. A million plus grotesque looking, starving and sickly aliens get stranded on Earth when they essentially run out of fuel.

3981524,4,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is a 2009 South African science fiction thriller film directed by Neill Blomkamp. It was written by Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell, and produced by Peter Jackson and Carolynne Cunningham. The film stars Sharlto Copley, Jason Cope, and David James. The story, adapted from Alive in Joburg, is a 2005 short film directed by Blomkamp and produced by Sharlto Copley and Simon Hansen.

The story, itself, is about a large alien aircraft that stops above Johannesburg, South Africa in 1982. When an investigative team enters the ship, they find lifeforms on board starving and malnourished.  The aliens, often referred to as ""prawns"", are confined to District 9(a government camp just underneath the ship). Unrest occurs between the aliens and the locals which pushes the South African government to hire Multinational United (MNU), a private military company, to relocate the aliens to a new internment camp. Wikus van de Merwe is appointed to lead the camp relocation by serving the aliens with eviction notices. Meanwhile, alien Christopher Johnson, his son, and an alien friend search for alien technology from which they distill a mysterious fluid, storing it in a small canister. While raiding the shack of Christopher's friend, Wikus discovers and seizes the container, which sprays the fluid onto his face. Unfortunately, it slowly begins mutating Wikus into a prawn. This is where the real story begins.

I have to admit, this isn't your typical sci-fi movie about aliens. What I liked most about the movie is the fact that it dealt with very real situations. My only dislike about the film is that it mostly was marred by mindless explosions and whatnot that seemed to take away from the real story beneath it all. Even though it seemed more like a political movie, it wasn't by any means. It did have its' flaws. For the most part, however, District 9 is a decent film.",1345420800,,1882,4.968253968253968
3981525,5,B002SJIO5O,"I am a big fan of sci-fi movies, but had been putting off seeing this movie because of all the mixed reviews. Watched it last night and I was extremely surprised at how good this movie is.  It's so refreshing to see an original idea and I really can't compare it to any other movie, which is a good thing.  It's sad that it's received so much criticism, although everyone is entitled to their opinion.  Yes, there are some things that don't make sense, such as how the aliens & humans can understand each other(although they've been stuck on Earth for quite some time so it makes sense to me that eventually they'd be able to communicate), but honestly, WHO REALLY CARES?!  The CG in this movie is pretty amazing in my opinion (some parts do look kind of cheesy though).  Yes, it's violent, but honestly, Saving Private Ryan was WAY more violent and everyone praised that movie, so if people complain that it's violent that doesn't really make sense to me.  I mean, who doesn't love a ray gun that blows people up?!  And I'm a chic.  I think the combination of action, comedy and horror really works in this movie.  Plot development kept me on my toes.  I enjoyed not knowing exactly what was about to happen as some of the characters are hard to read and act spontaneously.  Yes, it's filled with allegory, but I don't think they shove it in everyone's face as much as some of the negative reviews say.  I think people just don't want to agree that humans can be real jerks and they tend to turn a blind eye.  Maybe it SHOULD be shoved in their faces.

3981527,5,B002SJIO5O,"It happens to me quite often that I'll go see a movie the day it comes out and really enjoy it. But then over time forget what I loved so much about it, and when I finally get the dvd all those months later, I watch it again and love it even more than I did when I first saw it. The same thing happened to me with Iron Man, Star Trek, Batman Begins, Casino Royale, and a whole laundry list of what are now most of my favorite all-time movies. District 9 is no exception. I recently watched it again, and it was ten times better the second time. Neil Blomkamp is a relatively unknown director, but he created a masterpiece. I think D9 is a classic, and it definitely should not be forgotten as the years go by. Sadly, I believe it will be forgotten because of the big shadow that Avatar casts. One thing that District 9 has is an uncanny originality that I had almost forgot existed in the movie business today. Most notibly in the alien sub-genre. Too many alien films follow the same suit. Unlike most other alien movies, the prawns are not portrayed as villains. They are victims. It kind of made me sad to see how they were mistreated. One thing D9 does do is evoke different emotions. The movie is gritty and tense, sometimes sad, yet funny at times. Despite the fact that it is not a conventional action movie, the scenes when the action does pick up are breathtaking. Literally, if you're squemish. I happen to be a very little bit squemish, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching mens' arms, heads, and even entire torsos a couple times, get disintergrated by the prawns' various guns.

The cinematography in this film is nothing short of amazing. I never thought it was possible to be that captivated by the sight of a poor African slum, but D9 managed to surprise me more than a few times. The visual effects are spot on. I would even go as far as to say that they were way more realistic and believable than my favorite movie of 2009 (I doubt i have to name it). I have to mention the transformation of Wikus himself, brilliantly played by Sharlto Copley. I was glad that they used actual make up and tangible materials to create the prawn arm, rather than relying completely on CGI. I do love it, but I still have to admit that CGI has become a crutch for most. Speaking of Sharlto Copley's performance, how did he not get any major awards nominations? At least the Academy gave District 9 a nod for Best Picture, Visual Effects, Adapted Screenplay and Editing. Rather than the Best Pic nomination being a spot filler, I think it actually could have been a contender if the competion were not so strong this year. Nevertheless, District 9 is a work of genius and i do hope that there is a District 10. There were a lot of hints to it at the end of D9, so they better not disappoint. Thank God Peter Jackson and his team couldn't make that Halo movie they original set out to make, otherwise we would never have gotten District 9.",1341792000,4,2935,4.375457875457876

The action was pretty great, and I liked the characters. Overall this is a pretty great movie that you should definitely check out.

Also, keep in mind, that this movie was made on a low budget.

PLOT - MAY BE CONSIDERED SPOILERS:

  The aliens of a stranded spaceship struggle to live among humans as they search for a way to go home. Native Earthlings, realizing the aliens have nowhere else to go, place them on a reservation called District 9. The Earthlings then repeat history by making irrational assumptions to uphold racist beliefs and justify their poor treatment of the newcomers.

  The film stops just short of making a grand political statement and allows some humor to offset the tone just enough to keep it entertaining. It also contains  squeamish and violent bloody scenes.",1340582400,,994,5.0552147239263805
3981530,1,B002SJIO5O,"I'm starting to truly believe that a large segment of the human race (mostly male) has a defective gene. This defective gene causes a love of gruesome violence and a total lack of concern for the suffering of others. This gene also promotes binary thinking - the guy with the white hat is good and the guy with the black hat is bad. There's no in-between. And if there is - who cares!

A certain segment of Hollywood knows how to precisely exploit this genetic weakness and billions of dollars pour into their bank accounts. Telling a good story is a lost cause for this segment of the population. Show as much blood, guts, torture and torment as possible. It's such a formula recipe, it could be written on the back of a matchbook cover: Blood, guts, action = BILLIONS, year in, and year out! Why didn't I think of that?

If you love oceans of blood, vomiting, heads and limbs popping off of bodies with regularity, a graphic torture chamber used for medical experiments and repeated attempts at cutting off someone's arm - then District 9 is for you! And there is also ZERO sexuality in this film. (Why am I not surprised?)

The only reason I didn't walk out was because I wanted to see if the good guys were going to win in the end. I did actually care about the main characters and the gruesome violence made watching District 9 all that much sadder and annoying to watch.

THIS NOT A FILM FOR CHILDREN!! If the images shown do not disturb your children, I suggest they need to get some help. THIS IS A WAR PORN MOVIE! It exploits the audience, plain and simple!

Beside feeling sad, I felt empty when I left the theater. Lucky for me I was able to sneak into another movie and watch it for free. It showed only a single act of serious (and accidental) violence and that story was an absolute delight! Too bad Hollywood doesn't make more great movies that actually entertain instead of making films that are so depressing and annoying!

It also has some of the alien shoot-em-up scenes in it with good effects, but not too much, in my opinion.

District 9 is one of the most imaginative and refreshing science-fiction movies released, and certainly a treat to behold on Blu-ray.  There IS a very noticeable difference between the DVD and Blu-ray experience, to which I highly recommend the Blu-ray experience.  The acting, pacing, and direction of District 9 is award-winning material, but the real star is the story.  The story behind the film is just as relevant today as it was when it was released in 2009.  That the film takes place in Johannesburg, South Africa and not the overly used locations of New York or Los Angeles boosts the originality of the film.

3981540,4,B002SJIO5O,"District 9(released Aug./09)is a film  presented and produced by Lord of the Rings wonderkind Peter Jackson. Sony thought by putting his name conspicuously on the trailer credits it would entice the movie goers to give up their bucks at the box office...and it worked. What the tease trailer didn't show however was how long the film was going to be. I saw it on first release,and my opinion then,and after just having re-viewed it on DVD now,is the same...it is a little long. Having said that though,it is a compelling movie and if you stick with it you will be rewarded.
The story starts out in /82 when a huge spacecraft came to hover over Johannesburg,S.A.The locals waited and waited and finally moved on the ship and entered it. Inside they ran into alot of ETs...in fact over a million of them. They put them into nothing more than interment camps below,which was overseen by the MNU,a private security firm.
20 years come and go and the aliens,referred to as prawns because of their facial resemblance to them(they are bipedal),are rubbing the human population the wrong way. Finally comes the day when the MNU goes into the alien slums and tries to evict them for relocation away from the capital city and the peoples wrath. One Wikus Van Der Merwe(Sharlto Copley)is the desk jockey put in charge of the entire operation by the big boss of MNU,who just happens to be his father in law. Der Merwe is totally green and ill at ease at trying to deal with the situation. As we follow him and MRU around vis a vis a you-are-there type of camera style,we see and learn alot about how the aliens survive in the camp and how they are exploited not only by their own kind but by hard human outsiders,specifically a local band of Nigerian thugs who buy,sell and exploit them ad nauseum for their own wicked ends.
During what was supposed to be just another alien eviction Der Merwe encounters a father and son alien. Inside their shack he discovers a cylinder containing an unknown liquid. It accidentally sprays him in the face and after wiping it off he goes on with his job. The cylinder is bagged as evidence and sent to MNU headquarters for examination. As Der Merwe continues on he displays ever increasing signs of a terrible sickness coming on. After a couple of days his symptoms,such as losing fingernails and vomiting a yucky black ooze,he eventually finds he has grown an alien arm. The infection seems to be bent on turning him into a prawn. Back at the shack from whence the cylinder came from we learn that the father of the father/son aliens has been distilling a liquid for many years to be able to propel a spacecraft,which sits underneath his shack,up to the mother ship so they can leave. Der Merwe's confiscation of the cylinder has kyboshed  his plans.
Der Merwe's sickness has not escaped the watchful medical arm of MNU however. In fact with his father in laws permission,they want to eventually dissect him and harvest his body parts. Before they do this however,they want him to try and shoot several alien weapons which have been bio-engineered to work only with alien DNA.Against his will Der Merwe is forced to test fire the weapons,even on an innocent prawn. When they start to try and cut him open he is able to break away from the table and escape the building. He returns to the father/son alien with his dilemma to ask for their help. The father tells him if they had the liquid they could take him to the mother ship to return him to normal. With the aliens help they plan a break in of the MNU facilities,and they actually succeed in regaining control of the all important cylinder of liquid propellant.
Returning back to the settlement,and when all is in place,the alien tells Der Merwe that the process to return him back to normal will take three years(a trip to his home planet and back!).Der Merwe is in shock and as MNU troops close in on them Der Merwe commandeers the ship,but it is taken down shortly after take off. Der Merwe is taken hostage by the Nigerians and at the same time the alien has activated the mothership to move and hover over the downed ship on earth. Both father and son make their way to the ship while Der Merwe barely escapes with his life from the Nigerians,with a walking alien battle machine. Der Merwe battles the MNU troops,protecting the alien as much as he can. The aliens reach the ship and the mother ship,right on cue,lifts the smaller ship into the air until it is safely inside.
The battle ends and the film comes to its conclusion as we see Der Merwe,now fully turned into a prawn,sitting on a junk pile making flowers out of bits of scrap metal,which he deposits on the front doorstep of his home,for his wife to find;waiting for the three years to end.
The film is a definite metaphor for apartheid,coincidentally(?)situated in the very country it originated from. As the film opens we see the tell tale signs throughout Johannesburg of Humans Only or No Aliens Allowed. But this theme has a twist to it,as the very black population which was oppressed by the white minority,which resulted in the apartheid term in the first place,is now oppressing,along with Afrikaners,a new minority in the aliens.
When we first encounter the desk jockey Der Merwe,now put in charge of an operation which is clearly out of his league,we see him as a weak kneed and condescending company man,smiling and talking uncomfortably as the camera follows he and his team from MNU HQ and into the alien ghetto. When he gets violently ill and eventually starts to change into an alien,our original feelings,along with Der Merwes condescension towards the aliens,also changes. In other words as he becomes more compassionate towards them(in fact turning into one),we become more compassionate towards him. Finally,as I stated earlier,it is an overly long movie and it is this along with the directors slight over attention to details(that possibly should otherwise have been left out) that are the two main things that I find that work against it. The rest;the story,the pace and the S/Fx,is all good.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its original a/r of 1:85:1. Extras include deleted scenes,commentary and a three part featurette on the making of the movie.
In conclusion,though a long and at times an unnecessarily detailed film,the movie as a whole is pretty good and if you stay with it it is worth watching. Recommended.",1325203200,3,6402,4.720285969615729

3981542,5,B002SJIO5O,"Probably the best sci-fi movie I've ever seen and one of my favourites from all genres. You can take this movie as a commentary on contemporary issues or you can take it as a simple action film. Either way, it provides two hours of intense drama, action and character development.

Sharlto Copley is unbelievably comfortable in his role as Wikus van de Merwe and really portrays the character's transformation from a simple, bumbling pen-pusher to a hero. Yes, the character is heroic and you can see how, towards the end, he just grits his teeth and does what needs to be done. One the way to that stage, he is put through unimaginable (for him) circumstances, and it's heartbreaking to see him plead with the test guys at MNU HQ, to see him reaching out to his wife and just make sense of how his life has been turned upside down.

I can't imagine any other actor carrying this film like Copley has. He makes it work. The writing, editing, music and direction don't let down his efforts.

Given how this movie ends, I wonder how Copley will be brought back for the sequel.

3981544,5,B002SJIO5O,"This is a film that's very easy to be taken for granted, against all odds.  As conveniently simple as possible in its storytelling, yet still carrying more baggage that one would hope for, Blomkamp's directorial debut is slow to pick up steam.

But when it does...oh, wow.

District 9 is a freight train that somehow manages to creep up on you.  Its complex premise  is filled with incessant experimentation, with documentary-esque techniques used to set the gears in motion before resorting to more traditional cinema.  It may be a testament to the director that the transition is subtle enough to fall to the wayside amidst both the exhilarating action and impeccable performance by newcomer Sharlto Copley.

In fact, Copley's performance must be emphasized:  The radical trials that his character undergoes throughout the movie would be a difficult balancing act in the hands of any experienced actor; somehow, Copley maintains authenticity and a commitment to character that is both astonishing and emotionally crippling.

Even more impressive is Copley's acting debut when one is made aware of his most prominent co-star:  Christopher, a keen and determined insectoid alien.  Drawing from the film's graciously veiled root themes, Blomkamp's aliens are both repulsive and oddly intriguing.  Their tribulations are made clear early on, but careful crafting is done to ensure that the audience feels deep sympathy for the prawn-like organisms by the time the credits roll.

This is accomplished, in part, by Peter Jackson and his digital effects company, WETA.  Adhering to a $30 million budget, one wouldn't suspect that District 9 would hold the crown for the best special effects of the summer.  Alas, this proves to be the case as the film moves forward, using its stunning, yet conservative flair to complement the film, as opposed to overbear it.  Jackson and his team are masters of the visual arts, and it definitely shows here.

Let it be clear that District 9 is less of a retelling of a story, and more of a recording of an event; traditional plot features are often underdeveloped, or even wholly absent.  However, the film's jerky pacing is offset by smart, white-knuckle action that leaves you breathless.  There's definitely a giddy gross-out factor here that hasn't been seen since Jackson's early years, but Blomkamp ensures that it never overstays its welcome.

District 9 is strikingly original and certainly audacious, but isn't a movie that's difficult to like.  On the contrary, you'd be hard pressed to find a film all year that is as satisfying and complete as Blomkamp's science fiction thriller.  And, In the wake of unrealized visions and bloated wastes of cinema, that's a staggering accomplishment.  District 9 is an invigorating and intelligent climax to 2009's summer, and should not be missed.",1324166400,2,2828,5.1535087719298245
3981545,3,B002SJIO5O,Thought the movie was OK - just beware its more like a documentary and than an action packed movie like I thought it was going to be.  It's different but not too terribly bad.,1323993600,,175,4.147058823529412
3981546,5,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is a polarizing film. If you go onto Metacritic, you'll find that most reviewers either give it a 100 or 90-----or a 50. The same goes with the Amazon reviews. But my opinion is that YOUR opinion of the movie is a matter of taste. The movie itself is extremely well-made. The acting, effects, sights, sounds, plot, action sequences, all are top-notch. Whether you like it or not depends a little on what movies you like. If, like me, you enjoy films like A Clockwork Orange, Memento, No Country for Old Men, Pan's Labyrinth, etc. this might just be for you. District 9 is unusual and original enough to appeal to cult-movie fans, action-packed enough to appeal to adrenaline junkies, and intense enough to appeal to horror fans.
 So why all the negative reviews? The main reasons I can think of are that; some parts of it are gross--no way around that. More than excessive amounts of blood and gore though, the movie goes for intensity, like 27 Hours. Also, the overall plot or direction of the movie is a little bit murky at times. Some may be unsatisfied with the ending. Finally, a certain scene (I won't spoil anything) involving a mech goes on a bit too long.
None of these added up to make District 9 any less enjoyable for me. At the 'turn' of the film, during a particularly intense scene, I was simply gaping, open-mouthed, going ""OHMYGOD..."". District 9 will take you through a variety of emotions with its gritty, realistic camera and strong acting from Sharlton Copley.

3981548,4,B002SJIO5O,"This was actually a pretty good movie. It starts off really slow, and is kinda boring for the first 15-20 mins. I was about to turn it off. But I'm glad I kept watching because it turned out to be a good movie. I found myself getting attached to the main character, and also the main alien and the little alien boy (or girl? I never got that). It was very fun to watch.

I was cheering for them at the end, while they were trying to escape Earth. Some of the parts of this movie are a little unrealistic, but other parts I could actually see happening. If aliens ever did come to Earth, we would probably treat them in a similar way as they were treated in the movie. Unless they were so advanced and aggressive they just whiped us out from orbit.

I don't want go to into much detail about the movie, because I don't want to give too much away. But it was a really good movie. It was a lot better than I had expected. It had a completely different focus than move alien movies. It is played in more of a historical format... It's played like this is something that had happened on Earth in the past, and this was just a recount of what happened. Kind of like a documentary/movie rolled into one package. This time we are the attackers on the aliens, instead of the aliens coming to kill us.... (that was a nice change up). The graphics/animations also weren't that bad! They were much better than I had pictured.

3981549,5,B002SJIO5O,"Sure, District 9 straddles many fences.  It's part documentary, part action film, and part comedy.  Many scenes have an improvised feel, because they were in fact improvised.  The protagonist is thoroughly unlikeable for at least half the film.  Yet out of all this confusion, an engaging story emerges.

I won't discuss plot details (others have done enough), but I will say that this movie has a lot different styles of camera shots, from jerky hand-held documentary style, to well-shot landscapes.  I found it visually stimulating, yet not to the point of inducing nausea or seizures.  It was fun to watch.

The special effects are about as good as I've ever seen in an alien movie.  The ""prawns"" are a work of digital art.  And while there is a lot of ""gore"", it's not the kind that turns your stomach.  I don't like gory movies at all, and yet nothing in District 9 gave me the least bit of discomfort.  The fact that the plot is such a far-fetched sci-fi story probably accounts for this.

This is not a movie about nice people.  That's life.  And yet there is redemption and humanity within the carnage and madness.

It's unusual to see a science fiction movie where the setting is not the USA or possibly Europe.  This alone makes District 9 worth checking out.

I felt compelled to add a 5-star review to offset the multitude of moronic 1-star reviews consisting of ""I hated this movie.  It was terrible."" and nothing else.  District 9 might be the coolest alien movie I ever saw.

Almost everyone thought these signs were for the super secret J.J. Abrams movie (Cloverfield) but it turned out to be for the low-budget District 9.

After making a short for YouTube, director Neill Blomkamp was encouraged to make it a feature with the blessing of Peter Jackson.

Casting a bunch of no-names and having it take place is South Africa adds a flavor of realism if you can look past the fact that these are CGI aliens.

The movie begins as a documentary but quickly changes to a typical action/adventure sci-fi movie with lots of guns, explosions and characters shouting the F-word almost every other word. I can tolerate maybe a one-time use in movies but when the word is used so much, it becomes distracting and my rating of the movie falls with each utterance.

Add in a exoskeleton robot with massive firepower and what started as a clever film turns into just another summer action flick.

I was impressed with the CGI. The aliens really looked like they were in the locations and interacting with the humans.

3981563,5,B002SJIO5O,"An excellent movie, strongly recommended.  Do not really understand those who criticize the action part of it - it is true that the second half is a full-blown action movie but it works really well in the context of everything preceding.  The movie was never going to be a cerebral sci-fi so what's the actual problem with it?

The story is a bit simple but is marvelously directed with numerous details ornamenting that simple scenario.  That said, although the story can be said in a couple of lines, various intrusions, such as the unruly `Nigerians', or the `commentators' make it all very entertaining.  The last half an hour is indeed a vicious battle with strong references to robocap or iron man but I see absolutely nothing wrong with it.
There is some sort of nervousness, unsettling, and fast pace all along the movie which is fantastically reflected in how the movie is shot and through the lead actor (Sharito Copley) - that guy's chattiness, jerking actions, and well-suited appearance carry the movie extremely well.  Sharito is `real good' in District 9.
As well as the aliens, altogether with their mothership that mystically hovers above Johannesburg.  Beautiful special effects, the aliens are totally real and shrewdly put among the humans.
I would also like to commend the `Nigerians boss', not much onscreen but quite an interesting role.  The use of accent excellent.
District 9 concept is another strong point of the movie.  Misery, crime, lawlessness, violence and desperation echo very well with what one perhaps really finds in some slums somewhere.  The key point is that that sour place is chosen to accommodate and (apparently) implicitly destroy the aliens which makes it all bizarrely entertaining and fits perfectly into the whole concept.
The key credit goes to the director (Neill Blomkamp) for certainly the best sci-fi, entertaining action in last several years.  A right movie for adults as opposed to the incessant flurry of commercial sci-fi (actions) serving general population with the sole purpose of burgeoning the producer's bank account (and promoting the technical know-how).",1307577600,,2122,5.1395348837209305

3981565,5,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is a surprisingly awesome science fiction/adventure type movie focusing around alien invasions, violent annihilations, communication with alien creatures and of course, saving planet earth.

What makes District 9 distinctly different from most alien films is that it focuses around getting to know the aliens by way of one British man (the main character of the film) getting to win over the admiration of the aliens, gradually, through lots of intense shooting and violence as soon as he realizes how unfair they've been treated.

When a spaceship suddenly appears in the skies of Johannesburg one day, alien creatures then invade the entire city.  The people of Johannesburg desperately try to contain the aliens by using holding centers for the tame ones, and lots of heavy artillery for the more aggressive aliens, but of course, the aliens are reluctant to do what the people want, and of course, the aliens are there in the first place because they're on a mission.  Hey, you didn't really think the aliens would arrive on earth because they wanted to take a vacation did you?  A happy place to go just to get away from all the hectic everyday universe activity?  Yeah, haha.

Anyway, it was a VERY pleasant twist to give viewers an alien movie where they communicate amongst themselves and with the people of earth.  I'm talking lengthy, detailed segments devoted to actual conversations- not just snippets here and there.  A very nice change of pace from the typical alien movies we normally see.

Furthermore, the storytelling was never exaggerated to the point of total confusion.  It's easy to grasp the concept because the writing was never once hard to comprehend.

Overall, the only negative is that the first 10 minutes are devoted to fictional interviews with people in a lame attempt to try and explain the alien invasions (making it very cheesy and ineffective as far as creating a moving atmosphere is concerned) but other than a slow and somewhat irrelevant start, I was mightily impressed with the quality of the writing, the presentation, the acting and how easy it was to understand the events taking place.

The only science fiction film that even comes close to this film is ""Enemy Mine"". This film does have a beating heart and it belongs to Christopher Johnson(the alien). At it's core, ""District 9"" is a take off from a short story by Franz Kafka with a lot of Neill Blomkamp's South African memories thrown in. The lead actor, Sharlto Copley does an absolutely amazing job as the hapless, Wikus Van De Merwe, who starts off as a cubicle jerk and ends up transformed into a prawn (as the aliens in the movie are called). Considering that Copley ad libbed his lines without a script, the acting here is pretty interesting.  Unfortunately, Wikus the main character, does deserve his fate, no matter how you feel about him. A small hint: Wikus is not the hero of this film and is actually as much a victim as the prawns are. The movie is in reality part warning of uncontrolled Government/Corporate/Crony Capitalism/Overwheening human greed and part warnings about rampant overpopulation. The humans in this film with the exception of Fundiswa Mhlanga(Wikus's black assistant) are all the bad guys in one way or another. You end up seeing the aliens as victims, who even when using violence it is more to protect themselves and lash out at their human tormenters rather than trying to be evil themselves. One thing left out of the descriptions by most reviewers is an underlying plot element hinting at a war between the Prawns(aliens) and some other species out there in the universe. It is only hinted at in Blomkamp's storyline but shows up in the way the Prawn(alien) leadership was mysteriously killed before the film opens and the ship drifting into Earth orbit and over Johannesburg.

3981567,4,B002SJIO5O,"`District 9' was like that surprise hit of 2009, the film that no one expected to `go the distance', the one that racked up some surprising Oscar nominations (I think everyone expected that Visual Effects nomination, but Best Picture, Screenplay and Editing were pretty unexpected) and continued to astound critics and audiences alike.  I had been sitting on actually seeing this film for a while now, despite really wanting to see it.  I finally got around to seeing this the other night, and I must say that I approach this review with equal parts respect and bewilderment.

The film is very good, but it misses greatness in my eyes.

`District 9' references a slum that houses aliens that have landed in Johannesburg and have been populating the area for several decades.  Their mother-ship hovers ominously in the horizon, reminding the humans that the aliens are still there.  The humans have segregated the aliens, confining them to a small and disgusting area and have regarded them as nothing but trash, referring to them as `prawns'; a derogatory term used to label them bottom-feeders.  On the outset of the film we are told, in documentary form, that the aliens are about to be evicted and moved to another location.  Head of this particular assignment is Wikus Van De Merwe, a nave and slightly odd young man whose father-in-law obviously favors him (but doesn't truly care for him).  While serving eviction notices and checking for illegal weapons, Wikus stumbles upon a device harvesting fluids that the aliens have been working on for twenty years.  That devise infects Wikus and soon he finds himself morphing into one of the aliens.  His department tries to use him as a test experiment and when he escapes they do what they can to track him down and cover up their own negligence.  Soon he is a fugitive with nowhere to turn but the one place he doesn't want to be a part of, District 9.

The film is smarter than your average science fiction film in that it actually roots for a human core, something that can connect it to our world and speak to a deeper message.  In fact, it attains what it is searching for, especially on the surface.  `District 9' is absorbing and provocative, and that is a great asset to have within this genre, for it sets it apart and makes the audience take notice.  The action sequences are outstanding and the visual effects are tremendous (I prefer these authenticated visuals to `Avatar's cartoonesque appearance).  And yet, with such a sharply conceived idea (contrasting alien treatment with the apartheid) the film lacks the layers it needed to make this feel more human.  I'm tired of the whole idea that evil is one-note; that it is without levels of emotion.  In `District 9' it is apparent that humans are selfish and mean and aliens are misunderstood and kindhearted.  Even after being completely stepped on and stabbed in the back by a human, one of the aliens refuses to leave him alone in the sight of danger.

`District 9' is far too black and white for its own good.

Despite this flaw (ugh, why did it have to be there), this film is really well thought out and expertly crafted.  Director/writer Neill Blomkamp is one to watch for, since he really has a handle on this thing.  He has created a shockingly sincere and beautifully unique science fiction film that shows extreme promise for the young director (he's only six years older than me and look at where he is in his life!!!).",1302652800,2,3447,4.725752508361204

--Humans explode like water balloons. Awesome!

-- Excellent special effects that complement the movie and plot but don't overshadow it. You will begin to get used to the aliens as if they and the world you are watching is real as opposed to a film like Avatar where the special effects were the main draw. District 9 strives to make the effects not stand out so they don't distract from the story but make things look very real.

-- A redemption fantasy. This film is about a heel of a human doing the nearly impossible: realize he's an ass and make up for it. That is probably why so many like it, and such a tiny minority dislike it. The self-absorbed and those with short attention spans should avoid this.

-- This is not ""Dances with Smurfs"" ""Star Wars"" or ""Trek."" If your view of sf is limited to those kinds of franchises you likely will not like this film. District 9 is not a cliche or a rip off of eastern archetype story telling or a Costner film. It requires a bit of familiarity with the world, some of the recent history of Africa, organizations like the UN, and the ability to endure criticism and accept that humans are not God's gift to the universe.

-- If you fantasize about social science fiction which shows the human race as it truly is (our history is more than ample evidence), this is the film for you. It may be inspired by South African history, but it well and truly could have been made about the history of any nation. It is not a ""humans are evil"" story by any means, just a very accurate depiction of humanity.

-- Watch the director's commentary version first if you really want to understand the film later.",1302307200,,1829,4.493975903614458
3981569,4,B002SJIO5O,"This is a rough ride.  Not exactly a knee-slapper, no.  That's probably because this is astonishingly close to being accurate.  If aliens did arrive and we had any sort of advantage over them whatsoever, they would be exploited and subjugated by us.  This is science fiction that works.  It taps into the cultural zeitgeist and forces us to look at ourselves via a ""what if"" scenario.  The analogy to apartheid should be clear to anyone, with the aliens as stand-ins for the black population that is ""ready to take up arms against their oppressors"" to paraphrase Bono.  Humans even manufacture a derogatory term for the aliens (as we are so good at doing): ""Prawns.""  And there is debate within the film as to whether or not it is proper to call them ""Prawns,"" with one government official defending the slur by saying, ""Well let's face it, it's what they look like, isn't it?""  Indeed they are rather Lovecraftian in appearance.
It doesn't stop there.  The ""Prawns"" are reduced to eating cat food (even though they like it), there are horrendous medical experiments on them that amount to little more than torture (shades of Mengele), and an overall statement of ""man's inhumanity to other living things.""  Usually in the name of a profit.
The film is left open to a sequel.  Should that come to pass, I would hope that the filmmakers include a bit of ""prequel"" as well, explaining who the Prawns are and how they came to us in such a disheveled state.  Make no mistake, this is a good film and quite worthy of its Best Picture nomination last year.  But don't ever expect it to be rollicking good, 'splodey sci-fi or some such drivel.  You'll be lucky to make it through without shedding a tear or turning away in revulsion at times.",1300924800,,1735,4.642622950819672

3981571,5,B002SJIO5O,"As the movie hit its second act I was totally engrossed in the world of a South African reinstatement of an apartheid-like policy dealing with the aliens. It is probably my favorite movie of 09.

The Good: The down in the dirt style that South African director Neill Blomkamp weaves with his half narrative half documentary style. It feels like it was shot in a slum in South Africa.

This movie could only be spun by a gamer in love with Half-Life and Halo (which jacked a lot from half-life). For instance the Mech-suit (which can be seen in the trailer) is just like Dog in the Half-Life 2, but has a pay load of weaponry.

Speaking of weaponry all the guns in the movie kick ass. The alien rigs literally tear people apart. This film is not PG-13 so there was no wussy copout cutaways. In your face cherry pie gibbbbbbbbbing (gamer term for blowing another player into pieces).

This guy knows how to tell a story with details. I'm sure I will catch a lot more in a second viewing, but you have to be able to appreciate the amazing amount of detail, which really brings an oppressed alien culture to life.

The Bad: The excessive use to military force was the real enemy in the film. Of course there is other stuff but I hate spoilers sooooo. That's all you get.

The Ugly: In this film the aliens are pretty ugly... But Blomkamp somehow puts you in the main character's shoes enough to where you kinda dislike them at first and think they are gross, but as the story moves you find yourself thinking the crustacean looking things are cute (especially the children).

The MANDOM: There is some all out battles in this movie. People get torn up by alien guns and human guns alike. There is one random part where this guy is holding an alien up for integration the alien out of nowhere just kicks him and all you see is a limb explode from somewhere and the guy fly like a rag doll. That is tame for this movie. Heads get torn off, lots of people explode, and many aliens get blown away too.",1299628800,,1993,4.370270270270271

3981573,5,B002SJIO5O,"""District 9"" is the 'Proud Mary' of Science Fiction. It starts out at a measuredly pace, giving us a sensatory visual of the man who unwittingly hijacks us into his worst nightmare. Wikus begins as a nerdy, inept guy chosen by a large corporation to evict aliens from their razor-wired stockade to relocate them to a situation out of sight and out of mind. He is determined to get the job done and indifferent to the predicaments this will heap upon them. It appears that the government of Johannesburg, Africa initially takes at least a small amount pity on the plight of the aliens, but then simply ignores them for as long as possible.

And, this is where we go from cool and calibrated to a steady surge in story and action. Copley basically does a one-man show and he does it brilliantly. He goes from being a geeky civilian, simply a part of 'the system' who is safe and secure existing within life's routine who then, through a gamut of mind-blowing, out-of-this-world, life and body altering events, suffers a forced conversion of mind, body and soul of which he must decide a direction.

The manner in which this film seems to, more accurately than most, reflect the human reaction to situations of so-called 'good vs. evil' is impressive. Wikus, like most of us, operates comfortably within the policies and procedures and rules and regulations of job and society, moving myopically within the herd, until he is virtually compelled to do otherwise. In fact, at that point, I felt abandoned right alongside him. Still, it takes in-the-face trauma and violence for Wikus to perceive both his world and that of the aliens in a more representative light. Ironically, he still maintains his agenda, attempting to recoup his own losses, until, well... Anyway, are we not most like him?

Finally, the alien child is a character study in itself. The child is the only creature in the entire movie who thinks as an individual, deciding whom to like and whom to distrust, and so this scripture, created by a human, comes to mind, ""But Jesus said to them: Suffer the little children, and forbid them not to come to me: for the kingdom of heaven is for such.""  Children!  Whether they be wolves or people, those little ones are such sponges, innocent and ready to be influenced by those around them.

Well, I hope I am still around in 2012 to experience the sequel.  Hope it's not about the end of earth, humans looking for somewhere else to live...",1295654400,,2447,4.703271028037383

The humans look sharp and the color is well defined on the edges. The prawns (the aliens in the movies) stand out because of the higher detail that the Bluray Disc ensues.

3981575,4,B002SJIO5O,"`District 9' is an alien film with a difference. This is shot partly in a documentary style and follows some Aliens (nicknamed Prawns) who come to earth and who are segregated in society and who are kept in slums in Johannesburg. A government department called MNU administer and try to rehome the Prawns and this film explores what happens when one of the MNU team leaders becomes infected with an alien virus. This was slightly a slow starter, but after about twenty minutes this gathered pace and I was kept hooked until the end. The aliens aren't the explicit bad guys we have come to expect from modern films and there is real personality and a softer side to them that comes through, despite their rather unattractive exterior. This had a relatively unknown cast, who all perform well, and although the main character's South African accent can sound slightly like he is from Liverpool at times (especially when he uses the `F` word), this is the only downside to the film. The effects are pretty decent and whilst the film feels kind of low tech at the start (with the jerky documentary style camera work), by the end the effects are fairly good and the explosions and machinery are impressive. There is a lot of talk about the implicit apartheid themes to this film, and I am sure they are there, but you can just as easily watch this for a great sci-fi adventure as well. It has all the elements you would want, alien themed storyline, plenty of explosions and evil government agencies. All in all this is a good film and just over 1 hour and 40 minutes passed by in what felt like no time at all.

3981579,1,B002SJIO5O,"I didn't quite know what to think when my friends recommended me to see District 9.  I knew it had something to do with aliens, but not what to expect aside from a few extraterrestrials running around on screen from time to time.  Suffice it to say, I was kind of surprised that unlike a lot of movies, District 9 is not about an invasion.  I was intrigued because it was a totally different kind of sci-fi.

I don't know if it was the documentary style of filming, the obnoxiousness of the main character Wikus, the silly details like forgetting to bring enough armor for everyone, or the unrealistic reactions to the arrival of the aliens, but the first half-hour to 45 minutes of this movie felt a lot like Borat.  And for a sci-fi that feels like a political statement, that isn't a good thing.  For this portion of the movie, Wikus and company wander around District 9 ""getting signatures"" on eviction notices so they could legally move the aliens from one slum to another.  I think it was supposed to be funny when Wikus takes an alien slapping the clipboard for a signature, but the senseless violence that starts to occur around them is uncomfortable to watch.  Unfortunately, it keeps on going and going, and we are introduced to a variety of stereotypical groups and characters, and we learn a little more about the reasons why the aliens came here and did, for all intents and purposes, nothing.

Without spoiling too many details of the plot, the second half of the movie takes a totally different turn.  It's slightly better than the first half, if only because Borat/Wikus starts to become a little less obnoxious.  Of course, the plot holes which were very noticeable before, only become more obvious and even less believable.

The movie as a whole suffers from a whole lot of bad acting, unlikable characters, and a general sense of too many filler moments.  The directors, the writers, and the characters seem to have no idea how the aliens got there, or why they're there, and what they're doing.  In essence, they're just aliens to be alien - the rest doesn't really matter.  By the end of the first 15 minutes, when I was still convinced that there was going to be something interesting occurring, I was ready for this movie to be over.  Its a complicated political statement about the treatment of minority groups that could easily be applied to illegal immigrants or Nazis, take your pick.  For really hard-core sci-fi fanatics, this might be watchable, but I have a lot of difficulty figuring out why it gets so many good reviews.",1293580800,37,2553,4.662946428571429

3981581,4,B002SJIO5O,"So what would happen if aliens came to our planet? And what happens when they are potentially dangerous, but happen to need us? District 9 happens. Of course we would create a quarantine, try to control them, and wind up exploiting them as much as possible. Especially when there are weapons that they can use against us. We would tromp around in the disguise of good will only to keep ourselves safe. It's not a surprise. It's self-preservation and one of the reasons us humans have gotten as far as we have. Still, it's important to critique these ideas and District 9 does just that.

It is a story of alien life coming to this world. Their broken mother ship hovers over the city of Johannesburg. The government there eventually gave the go ahead to break into the ship and what they found were the starving masses of aliens living in refuse. They needed help. Unfortunately, they are not like us. They are also potentially dangerous. This mixture forces the government's hand to make District 9 where the aliens, nicknamed ""Prawns"" because they look like and ""act"" like the bottom feeding aquatic namesake, live relatively separated from the human world. The only contact they have are with dangerous gangs or with the committee created by the government to control District 9.

The story gets complicated as one of those committee members, Wikus Van De Merwe, gets ""infected"" with a substance that systematically begins to transform him from human to alien. The committee wants nothing more than to harness him, examine him, and in the process kill him. He begins, therefore, a journey taking him straight into District 9 where he finds himself entrenched in the life of one particular alien named ""Christopher"" and his little boy.

Wikus is initially a rather hard character to like, but through the transformation of his body we also transform our view of him. This does not come easy or quickly. He shows his human colors by working with self preservation throughout the movie, making us doubt what we should feel about him (as we should). One thing is for sure, our view of the aliens is steadfast.

With the context of the movie heavily steeped in how we, as humans, deal with differences in our society this film becomes a critique of all living life, not just aliens. How we treat, view, and act to those who are different than us can never be fully understood until we take their places. When we do, it is only then, that we can grasp the gravity of the situation. Even so, some of us recognize these issues, but they are too big for individuals to handle alone. The movie continually examines this societal norm while giving us an action packed, interesting, and very different film from the regular box office hits.

My main upsets with the film is its seemingly desperate cling to gore. They put so much of it in! It feels as if they were worried the story itself would not carry the movie well enough so they added the grotesque to make it more interesting and likable. Though I am not one to shy away from the occasional cringing moment I got bored with the extensive use throughout the movie. Because of this heavy handed use of violence Tania seemed oddly out of place with her continuous love for Wikus. It's touching, but completely out of place in the broad spectrum of the film. If they had developed that relationship further by giving them more screen time or scenes I believe it would have fit better. Otherwise, this film is a diamond in the rough. Rare and original. It remains open ended, as most movies these days do, but it is a good stand alone film as well if not for the critiques it provides.",1292630400,2,3629,4.646417445482866

3981583,4,B002SJIO5O,"I like the science fiction genre.  I find wonder in outer space, fascination in the prospect of finding life among the stars.  But what if life came from outer space and you know, hung around Earth for a while and interacted with humans?  And what if said life was housed in a concentration camp?  And said life had an affinity for cat food, rubber, and violence?  And said life was intelligent enough to master intergalactic travel yet savage enough to eat raw human flesh?  Such is the premise of District 9 (2009).

Story-Line

District 9 opens over the clear blue sky of Johannesburg, South Africa as several people narrate the story of how the alien creature referred to as ""prawns,"" came to the planet and get stranded here. For months nothing is heard from the hovering ship and finally the powers to be cut into the ship and find up to 1 million ""prawns"" starving and feeding off one another and evacuate them to the surface and fence them off in an area called District 9.

The protagonist in the violent and bloody little tale is one Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) a mid-level manager who works for the Multi National United (MNU) who has been given the unforgivable task of clearing out District 9 and relocating the extraterrestrials to a newer district with tents.

District 9 has become a cesspool wherein the visiting aliens live off each other and human cast-off's.  Nigerian gangs have been allowed to move in and prey off the aliens running black market prostitution and collecting for themselves alien bio-weaponry that can only be fired by the extraterrestrials.  So the Nigerians have introduced voodoo and mysticism forwarding the premise that eating Prawn flesh will allow access to the weapons.

While searching one house Wikus Van De Merwe happens upon a black vile which he stupidly opens and it splashes a black liquid into this face.  And over the next 72 hours he changes as the alien DNA supplants his own and he slowly ""turns"" into a prawn left hand first.

Meanwhile Wikus Van De Merwe's wife Tania Van De Merwe (Vanessa Haywood) is the traumatized wife.

My Thoughts

District 9 is certainly a different kind of SciFi movie, one that ultimately leaves a multitude of questions in is bloody wake.  Chief among these is why the extraterrestrials came to Earth in the first place?  Were they bent on conquest and something happen?  The movie hints that they ran out of fuel, but they demonstrated the ability to make more, so...Second question: with no fuel to run the ship, how was it able to hover above Johannesburg?  Third question: why were these seemingly advanced species content to stay within the confines of District 9.  With their advanced weaponry and obvious intellect, they could have easily have taken over the city, so...

Questions aside, I did enjoy District 9.  Sharlto Copley did a stellar job portraying the nave bureaucrat who while showing an admirable understanding of the aliens, even speaking their language, nonetheless demonstrated little respect for them.

As he begins morphing into one of the prawns, and is discovered by the evil heads of MUN, who seek to dissect him (for their own greedy desires of course), Wikus Van De Merwe has to go on the run eventually ending up in District 9.  His transformation from clueless desk-jockey to battle-hardened half human is intriguing to watch because he does such a great job.

The metaphors this movie introduces are so obvious I need not point them out, sufficed to say District 9 pulls no punches when it comes to the portrayal of naked racism and violence directed toward our extraterrestrials visitors.  And did I mention exploitation?

By the end of most science fiction movies I feel largely disconnected from the story, probably because the action takes place in a land far, far away.  With District 9 I did experience that same disconnectedness and that's the point the movie is supposed to leave the audience winded, shaken and thinking about our supposed humanity.",1290902400,2,3984,4.841949778434269

3981585,3,B002SJIO5O,"This was a movie with very good, and believable, special effects. However, the plot was horrible. Why didn't these Aliens just restart the Space ship over the city when they were up there? Why did it take the Alien father and his son 20 years to build a ship on the ground to fly up to the large ship over the city? Afterall, it was their technology to begin with. The Aliens looked like Insects. All of this short comings are forgivable. I think the producers had a good morale-line of the story, I think they tried to tell us about the ""what does it feel like to in the other shoe"" story. I gave it 3 stars because the Aliens looked like the FLY from the movie, THE FLY, etc. I brought this movie from Amazon's pay to watch. I have to admit the internet has changed since 1995.

3981586,5,B002SJIO5O,"Much has been said about how mesmerising District 9 is, that it is worthy of 10/10 stars & is a movie that comes once in about 50 years. I watched it, bought it, and I concurred with every positive review it generated. That said, I must admit that the movie could have been more exquisite if the storyline was not rushed and had more character development.

For starters, I am a bit discontent that Vanessa Haywood (who brilliantly portrays the character of sole protagonist's wife, Tania van der Merwe), only appears in the commencement and the conclusion of the movie. Vanessa is a brilliant actress & I await with bated breadth to see her next movie, The Sweet Shop, in as much as Bridge Of Names, which features David James (Koobus Venter) in the lead role. So it would have been more electrifying to have Vanessa's character developed in a form of her, let's say, defying MNU instructions & going out to look for her husband, Wikus, relentlessly endeavouring to discover the truth pertaining the sexual intercourse scandal with aliens (rumours propagated by her father), and even involved in some fighting hypothetically speaking.

They could have also mommentarily deccelerated the pace of the action in order to give more analytical detail to the storyline (the illegal genetic research programme performed on Wikus to be precise)), as was the case with the Incredible Hulk, when Thunderbolt Ross explained to Emil Blonsky the serum that was developed & what culminated to Bruce Banner evolving into the Incredible Hulk & Banner & Betty Ross sharing a private conversation in Betty's house. So character development of chief nemesis Koobus Venter (David James), corrupt MNU CEO Dirk Michaels (William Allen Young), Nicolas van der Merwe (Johan van Schoor), MNU heads & the likes would have at least complemented this classic flick.

Maybe they were hell bent on completing this movie within the running time of 108 minutes. The fact that it was nominated for four Oscar Awards but barely took home one didn't surprise me. These Oscars & Academy ""trophies"" are American based & will always favour their own talent. Besides which, District 9 does not need these meritorious awards to validated how incredulously great it is. But despite these minor flaws, District 9 in my perspective, is the best science fiction movie ever made, because the great things that transpire in it largely outweigh any minor flaws I have highlighted, thanks to Neill Blomkamp & Terri Tatchel for an unprecedented storyline.",1289606400,2,2507,5.0071942446043165
3981587,4,B002SJIO5O,"I was really excited to go see District 9 in the theater. The movie had a lot of hype, with the viral advertising and crazy-awesome website. The producer is also Peter Jackson, the genius behind the Lord of the Rings films. Plus, the story is about aliens and humans, and their interaction, which I thought sounded interesting.

Basically, twenty years ago the alien ship came to rest directly over the city of Johannesburg, South Africa. After some time, the human race decided to enter the vessel, thereupon discovering the malnourished alien specie. Thus, District 9 was established in the country, serving as a refugee camp for the stranded aliens.

As you can imagine, living conditions grew tense between the humans and the non-humans. The derogatory term ""prawn"" was given to the aliens, as they resembled the bottom-feeders of the fish aquarium in appearance and mannerisms. Often violence would erupt between humans and the prawns.

District 9 was a tremendous movie, and it is very easy to see the true theme of the film. It explores the issue of racism in an extreme, but still relevant, way. The unspoken question is should non-humans be treated the same as humans?

Naturally, I cannot answer this question for you. However, after watching the movie, I feel that anyone with a heart would answer the question with a vehement ""YES"". While on the surface this seems slightly silly, at a deeper level it mirrors apartheid racial struggle of South Africa, and more generally the racial issues of the world.

The special affects in the movie are beautiful, and I really could not get enough of the human body exploding into tiny bits and pieces. The aliens are remarkable, and their emotions are clearly portrayed on their face. The backdrop setting of Johannesburg and the refugee camp are completely believable.

Also, the filming style of this movie really pulls the audience in. It is shot like a documentary at times, and at other points like a traditional film. The documentary scenes look rather real, more so than Blair Witch or Cloverfield. The traditional filming style is also well shot.

The best thing about this movie is the plot. I barely scratched the surface of what's going on. On one of the trailers for the movie you can hear someone saying ""There's a lot of secrets in District 9."" Suffice it to say that this is true, and these secrets propel the movie at a fast and ruthless pace, toying with the audiences emotions. At times I felt disgusted, other times repulsed, and many times saddened.

I like a good movie that knows how to play with my emotions, making me uncertain what to believe and where things are going. I did not know what to expect for the conclusion of District 9, but I was thoroughly satisfied when the film went off. I can easily recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a different kind of movie and be taken along for a wild and crazy ride. This movie works on multiple levels, and I really enjoyed it quite a bit.

Note: If you are easily grossed out and the site of blood, vomit, torture, etc. makes you squirm, you may find it difficult to watch this film at some parts. But if you can get through it, you shouldn't be disappointed.",1288828800,2,3190,4.702508960573477
3981588,5,B002SJIO5O,"Absolutely one of the most original sci-fi ideas to come out of movie-dom in decades! Not since Alien and Forbidden Planet has there been something so unique. I've watched this movie at least 25 times,and I don't get tired of it! Loved the character development of Vikkers van de Merwe. He's a pencil-pushing, code enforcing drone of a human, whose mother never thought him smart. His father-in-law promotes him. Father-in-law has always considered Vikkers as weak. At the end, Vikker's father says he's forgotten his son and never thinks of him. Yet Vikkers ends up a Super Hero of sorts! I had never seen Sharlto Copley in anything before. I like him, like prawn parts, he grows on you.

As one of the other reviewers said, this movie should have been a trilogy with Part 1 being the fact that the giant spaceship ended up poised over Earth? Why? Apparently because of missing ""fluid"" for the tiny space-ship ""part"" that fell to Earth. Then humans went up in helicopters after 3 months, broke into said giant spaceship and removed the residents, then turned them into welfare bums on earth.

3981589,5,B002SJIO5O,"Aliens in science fiction movies can act as proxies for some group without offending too many people. The aliens in District 9 can stand in for any citizen in the world that does not have direct connections to those in power.
 District 9 is so well shot and acted that you may forget that you are watching a fictional piece of art. Especially if you paid any attention to the victims of Hurricane Katrina or the Haitian Earthquake. The movie gives us the mode of operations of the power structure any time there are refugees from some disaster. First the military confronts those in need. The sufferers are then isolated into camps. After all of that, ordinary people are recruited to manage the refugee camps. The more ordinary the person, the more responsibilities they are given.
 District 9 also brings to light a crucial point. That is that corporations lead politicians, not the people who vote for them.

3981591,4,B002SJIO5O,"I got a little bit motion sick during District 9. I was pretty disappointed it didn't seem to be about anything. It was a standard, shoot-em-up buddy movie. One partner just happens to be an alien. It wasn't till the very end, when you wonder if aliens from the homeworld are coming back, that it hints at being a Sci-Fi movie, or a movie that has implications for all of us or one examining changes in society. Well, there was the main character, Wikus, burning all the alien eggs. . .

There is a theme to District 9. It is about one thing, and one thing only. Building up and exalting the main character, Wikus. It 'pimps' him. I even wonder if that was the insider name for the movie during production. Wikus is a follower of sorts. He's an every-man, perhaps. He's not concerned with petty or personal politics. It might even be physical, he's a thin man. The counter-argument (and it's an easy one to make) might be that he grows or changes, during the movie. The movie goes pretty fast. I think it merely reveals his character. Even when he finally goes against type, is finally pushed too far, and he blindly lashes out at his alien partner, I think even this sells him. Even he can be pushed too far.

It is absolutely an incredibly well-made movie, it accomplishes it's task very well. Sadly, it has to descend into a shoot-em-up to accomplish it's goal? Wikus must become a master of arms - really cool ones - to become acceptable? Yes, a very sad commentary on our times. Does he even have to become an alien, in the end, before he is really 'real'? It is possible that, instead, this movie is targeted toward folks like the main character in the movie (and folks like me). The movie isn't about selling Wikus, it is about selling a might-is-right, tattoo crazed world to folks like Wikus. It never hurts to admire strength. It's working out so well for us.

I'm going to say I agree with those who note the racism examined in District 9. I don't really care. . . not at all. I'm a white racist, I guess. Or perhaps I just think there are already enough folks concerned about 'racism' as it is. But I do 'agree' with the idea - if you accept the notion that the alien prawns are stand-ins for another race. Much has been written about how they are. District 9 presents them as pretty base and even animal-like, both on the ship and then in the camps. Perhaps I missed something in the movie, the process where the prawns or refugees are 'dehumanized' against their better wishes. Almost forgot the scene where African girls prostitute themselves to aliens and does it help that the Black Africans in the movie are portrayed as cannibals and even worse? Should I repeat that statement again...? I probably should. Perhaps the movie makers feel racism can only be counteracted by further racism? Well of course they do. We all know liberals are the ones who make movies. This isn't discrimination against conservatives, it's just a coincidence. Although one it would seem in need of celebration.

One of the paradoxes of the movie is that a lot of reviewers comment about how Wikus is evil or kind of shady. Even surrounded by corporate henchmen, bile aliens, and sadistic cannibals, he's still the bad guy! Can brainwashing be overridden? Perhaps it can't be. This movie tries really hard. At the risk of an even larger number of negative votes, for the older readers, I'm going to quote someone else who is a lot more articulate than I am,

""Apparently, many uber-liberals do well on the IQ test. This means they can process information faster than average. But when they encounter conflicting good information, can they process the old information and replace it with good information faster than average? Doesn't seem so. In fact, they cannot seem to be able to handle conflicting information at all. There must be a way to assign a number to this mental defect"".

This movie doesn't do anything but exalt the main character of the movie (it does it well). The problem is I'm not sure this movie can really convince us that Wikus' district has 9.",1287273600,,4060,4.577716643741403

Movie #1: Title to be announced. The alien space ship with mechanical problems comes to rest over Johannesburg, S. Africa. There is no response from the mother ship for months and finally, Earthlings must break into it to find emaciated ""prawn"" space people. They are given the status of immigrants and placed in detention camps and are prone to gangs and crime...just like us. Where did they come from and why? This would be explained in Movie #1.

Movie #2: The current District 9 which has left itself open for a sequel. Van De Mer Wer (sic?) has to wait 3 years for his prawn friend Christopher to bring the big ship back to change Van De Mer Wer back to human.

Movie #3: District 10. In the meantime, what has happened to the human who is turning into a prawn? Did he completely become one and see the follies of humanity and decide to go back to the prawn's planet? Or did he decide to go back to human if Christopher saved him?

3981598,2,B002SJIO5O,"I admit the final half hour or so of this was extremely good, but I hated it virtually from the first few minutes.

Several believability problems:

1.  Housing the aliens wouldn't have been a hassle!  For something like that, countries would be vying to host them -- for research purposes, if nothing else.  The UN would probably have to maintain a waiting list.
1.  How are you gonna fit 1.5 million creatures in that ship?
2.  Civilizations in which when the leader dies, the masses are helpless and directionless are not civilizations that perfect interstellar travel.
3.  The ship wouldn't have flown at the end!  It had been there for like 20 years!  Human engineers would have torn that thing apart by then!
4.  Humans would have been able to activate the aliens' weapons by using their severed limbs.

So literally the movie is impossible to swallow.  This leaves us with its allegorical meanings.

This, also, was repugnant.  Not for a second could I buy the filmmakers' heavy-handed metaphor of the aliens as refugees.  Are they trying to say the prejudice against aliens is analogous to the prejudice against immigrants in our own society?  If so, they could have done a much better job showing how the fear of aliens might have some rational underpinnings.  As it was, it was as if the humans' fear and hatred of the aliens was completely baseless.  If we had been told that the aliens had had, say, some equivalent to Koran 47:3, then the movie wouldn't have struck me as so simplistically one-sided.",1283990400,,1513,4.75

3981602,2,B002SJIO5O,"This movie has received quite a bit of positive attention, and I must say I'm at a loss to understand.  I've read through the positive reviews here and understand that people like it, but I I'm still not sure why.  I will concede that it is impressively made and that the lead actor does a very good job (although I wouldn't say the same for the rest of the cast).  However, the script is a little weak and filled with questionable character motiviations and plot twists seemingly designed to eke out the maximum amount of gore from the project.  But my main gripe is that when all is done, the film doesn't accomplish anything.

The first 10 minutes of the film sets up a potentially interesting premise.  The following 20 or 30 minutes sets up a plot twist that could have lead to a fascinating follow up.  What happens instead, unfortunately, is a 90 minute shoot-'em-up manhunt that squanders any potential set up by the beginning.  Not only is it disappointing, but it's kind of disgusting to watch.

The violence is both explicit and relentless, and all of it is gratuitous.  The film EASILY could have achieved its aims with only a tenth of the gore.  Pathetic.  And of course it doesn't skim on the grotesque, showing agonizing acts of mayhem and painful biological transition.  If you like movies like ""Saw"" or ""Hostel,"" you might have a taste for this style of film making, but I avoid such films like the plague.

The way the film chose to portray the alien race was bizarre.  With the exception of one father and his son, it was a race of savages, a bipedal equivalent of ravenous jackals.  (Now that I think of it, the humans in the film weren't portrayed any better.)  As such, it is difficult to know what to make of the situation--are we to pity them because of the oppression they suffer, or are the humans justifiably confining them for their (the humans') own protection?  The film could have served as an analogy to apartheid or anti-immigration sentiment, but without eliciting a shred of empathy for either side, it falls flat in this regard.

So, then, what's with the oft-cited praise that this film is somehow a ""parable for our times""?  A parable?  What's the message, then?  That all living creatures are despicable?  That it's only a matter of time before rival sects destroy one another?  That we have nothing better to do with 90 minutes of our time than to watch exploding heads and acts of mayhem?  Indeed, I implore anyone who applauds this movie to tell what they learned from it.  (There very well could be something that I'm not getting--I really want to know!)

As Eckhart Tolle would say, this is a move made by pain-bodies for pain-bodies.  I'm still a weasel and a wretch, but there must be hope for me, because this movie turned my stomach.

Still, fair is fair.  Two stars for the effort put into it, the lead actor, and the special effects.  Also, this movie was strongly recommended to me by someone whose opinion I respect, so your reaction to this horrifically ugly movie may vary from mine (see what I did there?).",1281830400,9,3061,4.592250922509225

3981606,5,B002SJIO5O,"At first, the plot and characters in this movie seem quite bizarre, but it eventually becomes apparent that the movie is clearly and faithfully illustrating a theme which is natural to the human condition.  That theme revolves around what happens when a minority group lives in the midst of a majority group, with the division into different and opposing groups being established based on their differences in ancestry, appearance, language, diet, and other cultural traits.

In such a situation, the majority group may grow to detest the minority group and unjustly blame them for many of their own troubles, and they may even be tempted to exterminate the minority group (ie, genocide), but their instincts will usually tell them that that's going too far.  Instead, the minority group will usually be allowed to continue to exist, but they'll be geographically cordoned off and their rights will be limited, so that they suffer deprived circumstances, including epithets, physical abuse, poverty, exploitation, and crime.

Again, the movie illustrates this (important) theme well, and in a way that there's no question about who the minority group is and the ways in which they're being mistreated.  I found the movie gripping, and I suspect that I'll remember it for a long time.

If I have to come up with a negative criticism of the movie, I would say that perhaps some of the violence is over the top, and I wonder if it was necessary to include Nigerians among the really bad guys (given that their reputation is already bad enough).

Nevertheless, I do recommend this movie.  It's much better than I expected, and it does its job well enough to warrant a full 5 stars.",1280534400,56,1677,4.921985815602837

When H.G. Wells wrote ""The Time Machine"" it was as much entertainment as it was a social commentary on the segregation of the aristocracy and the working class. This is what Science Fiction was born to do. And this is what District 9 does. So, on top of the great effects and action, it's been envisioned with a lot of political savvy, too.

3981609,5,B002SJIO5O,"I haven't seen that many films that were released just last year, but there were several that I really liked, including District 9. This movie is one of the best to have come out in 2009, with perfectly good reasons. It's not a standard sci-fi picture, but rather a satire on segregation and xenophobia. It's distinctive in that it's not set in a typical metropolitan city (such as New York City or Los Angeles), but actually set in Johannesburg, South Africa. It's a pretty deep sci-fi film, and it sure does deliver. In addition to the satire and the high octane action in the last half hour, I like how the film starts as a documentary in the first half and then an action-packed adventure in the second half. But I think the strongest element in District 9 is Wikus van de Merwe, the protagonist played by Sharlto Copley. When he's first introduced, you don't seem to care about him at first. But when his life is in danger, you start to care about him. And when his life is REALLY on the line near the end, you root for him all the way. That is what I like most about this movie: you really care about those who try to survive. And despite the main villain being pretty much a cardboard cutout, District 9 is still a thought-provoking sci-fi film that offers plenty of action, adventure, drama, and even humor. It's one of the definite best films of 2009.

3981610,5,B002SJIO5O,"I highly enjoyed this film only because I expected something slightly different but still within the realm of science fiction.  After watching the film in its entirely, I was left with the impression that science fiction has taken a fresh, bold and political turn.  The opening scenes, with its documentary style filming, shows how the world would react to the arrival of extra-terrestrials.  As a person who watches documentaries, I love such ""mockumentary"".  With this film, science fiction is no longer limited to cheap escapism and the usual stereotypes of extra-terrestrials as being either benevolent (Spielberg's E.T.)or monstrous (Cameron's Aliens).  The aliens in this film do not come to either enlighten or destroy humanity.  They are simply proletarian-class refugees from outer space, and they, combined with their very ""alien"" appearance, draw an obvious analogy to the current problem of refugees and illegal immigration that is just going to get worse as rich countries get richer while poor countries get poorer.  This bold science fiction film is not afraid of being overtly political and drawing attention to a serious global issue, while continuing to use the same special effects, costumes, gadgets, futuristic weapons, space ships and action scenes that one normally finds in a science fiction movie.  Drawing further audience attention to the government use of private military contractors (PMC) is also a plus.  So ""District 9"" is still science fiction, but one with a powerful message about immigration, apartheid and social ostracism.  The idea of the hapless protagonist mutating into one of the aliens may seem like a bit too much and unbelievable, but his complete physical transformation into one of the extra-terrestrials is simply the culmination of his slow gradual ""alienation"" from human society.  If you are expecting fun escapism, find another film to take yourself and your kids to.  If you expect to see something different from the usual ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" popcorn flicks, watch this incredible movie now.",1278806400,3,2054,5.325077399380805
3981611,4,B002SJIO5O,"""District 9"" is a potentially great film that, unfortunately,  left its brains on the cutting room floor. A massive alien spacecraft is parked, incongruously, above Johannesburg, South Africa. After a suitable period of distant study, the government invades and discovers that the craft is filled with sickly aliens. These are promptly removed to a squalid shanty town, District 9, directly below the ship. There, the aliens prove to be ill-tempered, violence-prone neighbors for the local humans, who agitate to move them out of the city. The film follows a group of government clerks and police who seek to evict the aliens.

The first half of the movie was filled with originality and promise. The city-sized, haze-shrouded spacecraft itself was spectacular, and CGI used to render the wasp-waisted, humanoid aliens was near perfect. Watching the South Africans attack the ship using comparatively tiny helicopters went against most films in the aliens genre, which are either filled with peace-loving kewpie dolls or invulnerable mega-warriors. The irony of watching civil servants try to extract signatures from the clicking, grunting, ever-menacing  aliens was delicious and even funny. Wikus Van De Merwe, the civil servant who led the evictions (acted by a suitably sniveling Sharlto Copley) was a narcissistic figure full of his own self-importance who was barely more tolerated by his own people than by the aliens. And the willingness of government officials to inflict torture on their own citizens  in order to procure a desired technological advantage, while undeveloped, was all too believable.

The second half of the movie devolved into a sequence of hoary Hollywood clichs. There was the unlikely buddy clich, on the order of ""The Defiant Ones,"" in which a human and an alien must work together to save themselves. An interminable chase ensues, including a session in which bad guys talk endlessly about how they will hurt our heroes. There are cute kids in danger and unrelenting hunters, etc., etc. In spite of obvious parallels between apartheid-era South Africa's brutal dislocation of blacks and the treatment of the aliens, there was surprisingly little political meat to the movie. Why a film set up this elaborate allegory of man's mistreatment of man, then chose not to pull the trigger, is a mystery that robs the film of its potential for greatness.

Watch District 9 for the masterful acting, cool-ish weapons, writing, use of CGI and a few tantalizing good ideas. But alas, don't watch it for anything deeper.",1278288000,3,2540,5.213235294117647

Only science fiction can examine humanity in such bold clear functions.  It showed how we treat those we wish to help, once it becomes more of a burden to do so and once we grow weary of what we perceive of their own laziness.  The attributes of the ""Prawns"" in this film have been shared with many races and groups during any number of wars or crisis.

The acting is very good and the documentary format makes the first part very interesting as we learn about the aliens and how they live their lives. It does devolve into an chase scene and the final shoot em up scenes are just dumb action movie flair which while drawing down the movie, does not destroy it.  Still this is a film worth watching for its originality if nothing else.",1276300800,,870,4.37888198757764
3981621,2,B002SJIO5O,Except for the last 30 min. of the movie I didn't like it very much.  I won't be viewing this video again.  It's headed for 1/2 price books.,1276128000,2,140,3.9642857142857144
3981622,5,B002SJIO5O,"District 9, science-fiction at its absolute BEST, revolves around the attempts to relocate aliens, currently living in slum conditions in Johannesburg, South Africa, to a more suitable place - living alongside humans has obviously deteriorated. A bureaucrat,Wikus, appointed by his father-in-law, is tapped to lead the relocation efforts. Unfortunately, in the process, he becomes infected with the DNA of the aliens. (oh you KNOW the South African government has been performing ""tests"" to study the aliens!) Of course, Wikus will eventually turn into one of the aliens and the government wants/needs to ""harvest"" his body parts all, of course, for the sake of science.

The movie is intense, gritty, and disgusting.  It pretty much evokes the same emotions in the viewer which is where the power of the movie lies.  It takes the viewer on a VERY uncomfortable review of one's own biases/prejudices/apprehensions. In the beginning I was horrified watching the amount of firepower humans enlisted to implement the relocation policy thus making me dislike Wikus almost immediately - especially since he benefited (for lack of a better word) solely because of nepotism.  I was immediately moved to support the aliens but, GEEZ, they're so ugly!!!

Then Wikus becomes infected, becoming of intense interest to the South African scientific community, and becomes the hunted rather than the hunter. Now Wikus is as sympathetic as the aliens and thank god, not NEARLY so ugly.

It was INDEED startling to be reduced to making assumptions about someone SOLELY on the basis of how they looked.  The aliens here are quite intelligent. Moreover, they only want to get back to their own planet and have no ill-will toward humans, unless, of course, provoked. So in most cases they do NOT deserve the inhuman (no pun intended) treatment they are often subjected to.

Their just god-awful ugly!!  And it is disconcerting to have to admit AND deal with this.  Compound this with a language barrier and we find ourselves looking at some veeeeeeeeeery similar situations we find ourselves in in our everyday lives.

The special effects are mind-boggling and the interactions between aliens and humans recalls social conditions we are all entirely too familiar with.  Yes, it uncomfortably evokes the reasonings behind immigration, integration, segregation, minorities, cultures/situations we are unfamiliar with, and forces us to take an historical perspective of just how well (or how badly) we have dealt with similar situations.

The movie is fast-paced, action-packed, gross, poignant, revolting, and THOROUGHLY entertaining. It is reminiscent of the best that the Twilight Zone and Outer Limits had to offer and quite frankly, trying to categorize the movie not only is difficult but ultimately unfair.

Hands down - one of the BEST movies of ANY genre I have ever seen.

Oooooooh yeah.....I INDEED recommend!",1276041600,,2898,5.283224400871459
3981623,4,B002SJIO5O,"""District 9"" is a remarkable film from a first-time director. It is so thoroughly professional and /assured/, from beginning to end, that it looks as if it's the work of someone with a lot more experience.

It's such a finely crafted and rousing piece of movie-making that I was reluctant to give it only four stars. But I had to, because of serious plot and script problems. Even while you're watching, you're all-too-aware that none of it makes any sense. Why are the aliens unable to leave at the beginning, but suddenly able to do so at the end? Why does Christopher spend 20 years accumulating ""fuel"" to power the shuttle, then suddenly be able to move the mother ship by remote control and use a tractor beam to enter the ship? Why does the ""fuel"" cause Wikus to mutate (other than to make him the p[r]awn of MNU and the Nigerians)? Most of all, why were the aliens taken from the ship before anyone determined whether they could have been helped /without/ removing them?

I'm often criticized for being overly rational (see my ""Up!"" review) -- ""It's only a movie!"". But I expect writers to think things through, rather than using whatever pops into their heads. The writers -- one of whom is the director -- supposedly came up with a dozen possible storylines. Peter Jackson apparently didn't bother to tell them that this one had Queen-Mary-sized holes in it.

""District 9"" is ultimately a drama (though a shallow and not well-developed one) about beings alien to each other learning a degree of trust and respect. It's a modest success on that level, despite failing to tell us much about the aliens' psychology and motivations. It /could/ have been a better film -- though it would have been even darker and more pessimistic than it is.

The Blu-ray's image quality is exceptional. Most (if not all) of ""District 9"" was shot on Sony and RED equipment. Though the BD looks like film, I suspect it's the composite digital ""negative"", graded to look like motion-picture film. It is of absolute demo quality.",1275868800,,2014,4.713068181818182
3981624,4,B002SJIO5O,"The movie started off slow and directed like it was a documentary.  A mothership of aliens comes to Earth and stays hovered over  South Africa.  A military orginazation (NMU) sends a team of helicopters and moves the aliens to live in District 9, a hovel fillled area.  The aliens are called ""prawns"" and like to eat catfood.  The aliens also bring very advanced weapons that NMU is very interested in.  Unfortunately only the aliens can fire them because the weapons have sensors that only work with prawn DNA.

The NMU decides that the aliens are to be relocated to another area a few miles away.  They send a team headed by one guy who seems like a ""Monty Python"" comedian.  He makes the aliens sign eviction notices.  I never could understand his name because most of the movie is spoken with very heavy South African accents and it was difficult to understand a lot that is said in the film.

The spokesman discovers a viles of liquid that he tries tasting and it makes him sick.  He takes the liquid with him and then the liquid starts to change his body.  The changes make NMU very interested because his metamorphasis makes him able to use the alien weapons.  He goes on the run from the NMU and he has to stay alive while they are chasing him and also gets involved with some very bad Nigerian mafia.

From this point the movie changes away from the documentary format and is very exciting and has a lot of tense moments.  The difficulty in understanding the accents does not matter and the action is excellent.  There are also some poigniant moments as he befriends one of the ""scientist"" prawns and the two team up to help him and also help the scientist prawn get back to the mother ship.

I almost gave up on this movie but it turned out to be very good.  The special effects are similar to the Robocop movies but the great action and tense moments make up for the older effects.",1275782400,,1892,4.4476744186046515

Now I know why if flopped in theaters. Now I know why Blockbuster has dozens of copies, always in stock, never checked out.

3981626,1,B002SJIO5O,"*** This review contains spoilers ***

Right away 'District 9', with the giant alien mother ship hovering in the sky, reminded me of the earlier movie and TV series 'Alien Nation'. That TV Series actually was an improvement over the original movie as the characters had some wonderful idiosyncrasies and you could easily identify with them as they represented a new (and also familiar) ethnic group. Not so with District 9. The aliens look part insect, part crab and have an unintelligible language consisting mainly of clicks and other weird sounds (somehow the aliens can easily understand English but we viewers must watch subtitles; it's not very clear whether humans in the story can understand the 'prawns' very well--you never see any interpreters assisting any of the soldiers when they enter District 9 and attempt to evict the prawns). Even worse is the fact that the prawns are not a very likable bunch as they are scavengers and as we are informed from the outset, constantly committing crimes against the human population which leads for the call for them to be relocated.

The first half hour of 'District 9' is devoted to what I would call a mockumentary (similar to the film 'Waiting for Guffman'). The film takes place in Johannesburg, South Africa and various people are interviewed providing the back story of the alien arrival and subsequent colonization on earth. The filmmakers were lucky to find an abandoned shantytown in Soweto where set designers ably created a massive junkyard inhabited by the prawns. During the mockumentary, it's established that some kind of command module floated down to earth from the mother ship but for some reason, after 20 years, it's never been located inside District 9. I would think that if an alien ship actually landed here on earth, there would have been a huge team of international investigators searching for that module and no doubt finding it after a short search.

District 9 becomes more confusing when we're introduced to the protagonist, Wikus Van De Merwe. He's a bureaucrat who also happens to be the son-in-law of the director at MNU (Multinational United), the corporate group of military contractors who have been awarded a contract to relocate the prawns to a cleaner district outside of Johannesburg. I could never understand why the company needs to have the prawns EACH sign an eviction notice before being relocated. The explanation is that it's a 'cover' but how could the company possibly have 1.8 million uncooperative creatures sign an agreement? If they kept the operation closed to the public, there would have been no need for those eviction notices. Wikus looks ridiculous traipsing around trying to collect signatures and he's such a buffoon of a character that one wonders if the filmmakers were actually going for comedy toward the beginning of their narrative. Certainly the prawns' ravenous desire for cat food adds to the comedy and a group of Nigerian criminals also get short shrift here too as they have no regrets about living inside the odious District 9 and scamming the prawns for alien weapons (which they don't know how to use) in exchange for cat food.

The mockumentary is pretty much dispensed with as we break into the second act of the story. A prawn and his son have been working for years developing some kind of fuel to power the command module back to the mother ship. Wikus manages to ingest some of the black goo and much like the movie 'The Fly', he grows a prawn hand. The bad guys from MNU (they're all bad!) decide to cut Wikus up and sell his body parts to the highest bidder (there's some mumble jumble talk about how his 50-50 human/prawn DNA will sell very well on the black market). Wikus of course escapes and begs for help from the prawn and his son inside the underground module. The prawn can possibly help him in three years after returning to the mother ship but only if they can get the container containing the black goo from MNU headquarters which Wikus had confiscated when he first found it. Much like Terminator 2, Wikus and the prawn break into the impenetrable building and grab the container, only to be chased by MNU's top killer.

Wikus is then captured by the Nigerians but manages to escape by fitting himself into a giant robotic fighting machine (shades of Transformers and Iron Man!). Our Bad guy killer from MNU manages to finally disable the robot and Wikus falls to the ground almost unconscious. Wikus however is saved when a bunch of prawns rip the MNU guy's head off (fortunately there are no close-ups). Oh yeah--the prawn and his son use the goo to power the module back to the mother ship. Everyone's thrilled when the ship leaves our atmosphere. Back to the mockumentary where we learn the prawns have been resettled.

From a confused and awkward stab at comedy, District 9 tries to get real emotional when Wikus and the Prawn and his son BOND! Suddenly the prawns are actually sensitive creatures and Wikus is a hero for saving them! None of it works, since we haven't been invested in the unsavory Prawns from the beginning nor do we care about Wikus, despite all the pseudo-heroic machinations.

If you watch the extras on the DVD, you'll learn that the script was patched together by the director and a co-writer on the fly and that the director really didn't have much of a clue as to what he was doing as he went along. I'll confess that the editing team saved this movie from being a complete disaster. Nonetheless, it's clear that the filmmakers tried to straddle between the worlds of both comedy and pathos and ended up with a hybrid of pure goofiness.",1275523200,27,5618,4.791537667698658

District 9 is another take on what would happen if aliens came to earth. It's a story about what would happen if a single ship came to earth with highly advanced technology (somewhat reminiscent of moments in the classic Independence Day) and, as per all of these scenarios, throw the entire world into a giant hissy fit.

However, unlike many other variants of this storyline, the aliens come not as conquerors, but as a species uniformly sick and vulnerable. What would the world do if presented with a helpless alien race that was desperately in need of aid? In this story, set up refugee camps in some armpit corner of the world and throw meager amounts of foreign aid their way and try to worry about them as little as possible.
Beyond that basic premise, the movie descends into a very familiar (if enjoyable and well done) story about a single lone protagonist wanted and hunted by nearly everyone else in the world. There are quirks, there are some unique and great moments, but it stops being about the initial and fantastically interesting idea to become a more standard Hollywood action movie.

The concept of a UN run refugee camp for sick aliens, and the gritty, grim but realistic vision of how such a thing would happen and be run was brilliant. The initial concept of an alien ship coming to Earth to beg rather than conquer is equally fascinating. This part of the film is interspersed with footage of interviews with real people about a real-world refugee camp in their own country. With it's documentary style and presentation of a true possible-world scenario, the beginning of the movie had me absolutely enthralled.

Unfortunately, the early brilliant moments are zoomed into the single protagonist I mentioned before, and on the whole the movie steps away from it's own most interesting qualities.

That said, in my final review, District 9 is a movie with a brilliant setting and ideas that promises something comparable with Children of Men. What it delivers is a simple, albeit good, action movie. Worth a watch, but I would put this one down as a rental rather than a buy.",1274918400,,2118,4.794520547945205

3981635,5,B002SJIO5O,"'District 9' is one of those movies that blindsided me - I had heard a little about it before seeing it, but few specifics. I was excited and hopeful, usually signs that I'm about to be disappointed. Not only did the film not disappoint, it went well beyond any expectations I had of it.

In terms of story, it's a film where very little is as it initially seems. You are presented with a deceptively simple scenario - a large alien craft has sort of broken down over Johannesburg, South Africa. The aliens within, numbering over one million, had to be rescued and brought to Earth, kept in a separate zone of the city (where the film gets its name). Their technology was advanced but only usable by the aliens. All this you learn in the first five or ten minutes, and the rest of the story develops from there at a breakneck pace.

The first impressions of characters you meet early on shift and pull back, revealing hidden facets and surprising twists. Initially weak people end up showing surprising strength, and people who seem initially unimportant become very important indeed. Pay attention to the details as you watch 'District 9' - it's well worth it, and almost a necessity to catch the subtle hints of character and depth as they develop. It quickly becomes clear that there is something not quite right in District 9, and whether that is coming from the aliens, the humans, or both is what is revealed, with deliberate and calculated pacing.

Stylistically, 'District 9' is just as impressive. The initial scenes are done in a broadcast news format to bring you up to speed with the story so far, and while the news team goes away relatively early, the style stays the same. The whole movie feels a little like a documentary shot on-location, in the moment, which results in a very genuine feeling overall. The effects are impressive and well-integrated into each scene, so much so that it becomes hard to tell what is effects and what is part of the scene. And after a while you just don't care, because the story grabs you and doesn't let go.

'District 9' is one pleasant surprise after another. Simply put, it's science fiction as it should be - an exciting story, believable characters, and a real personality. It avoids the grandiose and exaggerated and explores its ideas and themes in a very personal way. 'What if this were to happen?' it seems to ask...and the answer is frightening, hopeful, and enlightening all at the same time.

All this in less than two hours? Yeah, I was pretty blown away too.",1274572800,,2523,4.647982062780269

Subsequently I purchased the Blu-ray version and have watched it in various locations under ideal circumstances. I've recommended it to my movie-loving friends.  The feedback has been amazment, and totally positive. Not only is the CG work flawless, the acting, especially the lead actor, and the direction, all are of the highest level.

1) Clips from previews where not in the actual movie. For example, in a preview they asked an Alien why they where here.  The Alien replied we cannot leave you are holding our ship.  That is one of the clips that are not in the movie.  It is almost like they changed the movie at the last minute.

2) Every other word was the F word.

3) Many flaws in the story and plot flow.  It was like watching a small child playing.  The flow and plot was inconsistent.

The reason they where stranded was because their space ship would not work. They where stranded on our planet.

In the end they found to return to their spaceship so that they could fly away, not to repair it jsut to fly away.

They worked for years to repair small space ship to fly back to their ship suspended in mid-air.  The military blew that us instead they used a remote they always ahd to beam them to the ship.  Why would they wait for years when they ALWAYS had the remote!!?!?  How did they fly away when the ship was BROKEN the reason they where stranded??!

3981645,5,B002SJIO5O,"This is a GREAT movie about a very plausible situation. A MUST-SEE!! An Alien ship, transporting hundreds of Thousands of Alien population malfunctions and they are obliged to land here on earth. This is an important detail, because later on you will get to understand that they are both technologically and socially much more advanced than us, and they would have not chosen earth as a destination. Actually as they were maneuvering a smaller aircraft coming from the main ship lands, but that is a minor detail that will only become major later. In any case we get to the main ship and bring the aliens down to earth, they were weakened and needed food, so the decision was made to transport them all down to a refugee camp as a 'temporary measure' they somehow were able to breath fine, and particularly enjoyed cat food. The main ship remains afloat Johanesburg in South Africa and down below the Aliens live in a camp that quickly turns into a funky slum. What is great about the movie is making the transition between Alien exotica and 'everyday Alien"", we see them interchanging with humans, trading, and constantly moving about. Although they look like human sized lobsters, and are referred to as ""Prawns"" they pretty much have the same configuration as ours.

The movie starts actually a full twenty years after the 'landing' so all the glamor of news and novelty is gone and the South African Government is just trying to move them to another district, further away from their capital city by forced eviction. At this point the man in charge of the operations, Wikus Van De Merwe played by Sharlto Copley gets infected by a canister that contains a liquid two of the aliens had been hard at work for a long time. He does not know this, he thinks they are gangsters because their hut is full of computers and weaponry, but in reality they are the scientists amongst the aliens that have been working all this time to fix the spaceship, when he accidentally sprays some of the contents on himself he starts triggering a genetic reaction that will slowly change him into one of the creatures in a slow but very visible way. The strong, excellent performance by Wikus is what makes it believable, he is a totally square and regular guy, actually pretty good natured and in the process of this horrific change he maintains his humanity and sanity and has a complete change of heart in his relationship to the Aliens, as he is forced by circumstance to 'bond' with the one scientist who was involved in making the liquid, and his small son.

The film is important in showing the complexities of the exchanges with the Aliens and covers full well the political intrigue and inhumane behavior that is part of our present state of evolution. It starts out very slow and is not particularly great in the introduction of this information, so that at one point I was getting very impatient, but then started to enjoy the flow of the story. The turning point was the intervention of the liquid that changes Wikus and everything about the movie from that point forward.

This movies is about a first contact from hell, in which alien refugees are corralled into slums by cynical humans. This is certainly a very, very different portrayal of first contact. The film's approach to humanity, the mix of opportunism and sheer indifference, strike me as jarringly realistic. I know it sounds crazy, but at times I though to myself: yeah, this does seem possible. This could be how it happens.

Part of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/District-9/dp/B002SJIO5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">District 9</a>'s success comes from the way it was filmed. Much of the movie is filmed as if it were a documentary. Television crews accompany the hapless bureaucrat Wilkus (Sharlto Copley) as he evicts the aliens from their shacks, giving it the feel of a news report more than sci-fi/fantasy movie. The movie also interviews ""experts"" in alien biology and sociology, which brings audiences up to speed on the situation. At first, I was skeptical about this cinematographical technique because it sounded a bit corny, but it's actually very effective. It really helps blur the distinction between reality and the movie, allowing viewers to become totally absorbed in the story.

I was a bit disappointed that, midway through the film, it seemed to descend a bit more into a typical action flick. It never quite went too far to spoil the movie. In fact, one of the things I really loved about the movie is how the characters responded. Even during the most intense battles, when other movies would have simply focused on the big fireballs,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/District-9/dp/B002SJIO5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">District 9</a>&nbsp;has compelling moments when the various characters must make important choices.

3981647,5,B002SJIO5O,"Presented by Peter Jackson, ""District 9"" is a unique take on sci-fi action with character-driven story. The film begins with ""documentary"" footage of a huge spaceship that arrives from outer space. It appears over the city of Johannesburg and hovers there for more than 28 years. The aliens that have come with the machinery are all contained in the area ""District 9."" Now the government and human citizens alike want them go away.

Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) works for a big corporation, Multi-National United. He is assigned to relocate (forcibly) the unwelcome visitors from outer space, now residents of the city's now notorious ""District 9,"" to another place where the government promises a better life. Things go terribly wrong for bureaucratic MNU employee Wikus, however, when he stumbles upon a mysterious cylinder with black matter in it. Not exactly a bad person, but Wikus is kind of a man who always does something he is not supposed to do.

What ensues is a tale of an unlikely hero trapped in two or more rival factions. The entertaining story is told with lots of actions and a bit of dark humor.

Film fans may point out that some of the film's subject matters have been explored before (the 1988 film ""Alien Nation"" directed by Graham Baker, for instance). Sometimes science fictions with aliens from outer space can be a metaphor for immediate political issues. Director Neill Blomkamp may not be as sophisticated or psychological as, say, Don Siegel and his classic ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" - ""District 9"" contains considerable amount of gores and graphic violence - but the film works nonetheless, with thrilling actions and characters you care.",1271289600,2,1683,4.98220640569395

We started watching it last night, and neither of us were expecting what we got.  The film was mostly a documentary style of movie.  The trailers we saw made it seem more like an ID4 kind of movie, not a film done as a documentary piece.  Both of us were turned off by it, and to be honest, about 45 minutes in, we were both bored.  I looked up the plot on Wikipedia on my iPad, read it out loud, and then we watched the last five minutes.

Totally disappointed.  I would have given it one star, but the visual effects were very well done.  The film was made well, I recognize that, but I was totally let down by the kind of movie it was.  Didn't enjoy it, although I can recognize a well made film, even if I don't particularly care for it.

3981651,3,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is an exciting, though provoking film. It is delivered in the low tech environment of a typical South African city and ghetto town of our current time. The movie starts out a little quirky but picks up focus and direction well, and really gets going around 30% in.

HOWEVER, beware, that this is most definitely NOT an exploration of aliens, of humans reacting to aliens, of looking for aliens, bonding with aliens, exploring space or technology or anything like that. You realize very strongly soon after the movie starts that this is Hollywood routine again and the storyline is not focusing on the reality or sci-fi of the ""alien"" topic, sadly and quite disappointingly.

This is exclusively about human class warfare, predatory corporate monopolies mixed with politics, brutality and tyranny. Movies on that topic are very welcome.

I gave this only 3 stars. There is a severe lack of wonder, sci-fi, real science, just a relentless rehash of man's inhumanity to man, with aliens (poorly conceived body designs), run through the Hollywood routine and pumped out like another Dr. Who or Star Trek episode with essentially no high profile Hollywood actors used.

Director Neill Blomkamp teams with producer Peter Jackson for this tale of extraterrestrial refugees stuck in contemporary South Africa. It's been 28 years since the aliens made first contact, but there was never any attack from the skies, nor any profound technological revelation capable of advancing our society. Instead, the aliens were treated as refugees. They were the last of their kind, and in order to accommodate them, the government of South Africa set up a makeshift home in District 9 as politicians and world leaders debated how to handle the situation. As the humans begin to grow wary of the unwelcome intruders, a private company called Multi-National United (MNU) is assigned the task of controlling the aliens. But MNU is less interested in the aliens' welfare than attempting to understand how their weaponry works. Should they manage to make that breakthrough, they will receive tremendous profits to fund their research. Unfortunately, the highly advanced weaponry requires alien DNA in order to be activated. When MNU field operative Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is exposed to biotechnology that causes his DNA to mutate, the tensions between the aliens and the humans intensifies. Wikus is the key to unlocking the alien's technology, and he quickly becomes the most wanted man on the planet. Ostracized and isolated, Wikus retreats to District 9 in a desperate bid to shake his dogged pursuers",1269820800,,1568,5.272

That we would use alien technology,etcera. Another one of those deep social messages like avatar. First off, If it were aliens they would do the same thing.

3981659,5,B002SJIO5O,"The director says that ""District 9"" is primarily for entertainment, and should not be viewed as a political tract.

But it is political, and quite well done because it insinuates an interesting message without being preachy.

That's because nothing is stated, and everything is dramatized.  You are forced to draw your own conclusions.

The main message is: prejudice is deep and almost intractable.  But this message is not immediately apparent because the aliens are deliberately creepy-looking and apparently vicious.

In short, in Effective Prejudice style, the ""other"" is instantly dehumanized, and so it is easy to feel scared and defensive about them.

But the rest of the movie humanizes the aliens, and de-humanizes the humans (quite literally in the case of the hero).

By the end, you are rooting for the aliens and for the poor hero who realizes his own salvation depends on them, and against the paranoid and trigger-happy humans.

The documentary style is flawless and jittery and involving.

For U.S. viewers (like me), this apparent you-are-there realism is made stronger by the fact that all the actors are South African and to me unknown--they seem like actual people going through actual, unpredictable events.

3981660,4,B002SJIO5O,"A friend of mine and I were sharing opinions about District 9. I liked it better than I thought I would. He thought it was brilliant. He wrote that it was a very incarnational film. This was a definite theme. The main character was contaminated by a liquid and he was slowly being turned into an alien. The man had insights into the human condition and the alien condition that he never had before. He was selfish and became sacrificial at the end. Another example, the gangster wanted to eat alien flesh so that he could become an alien. The bad military officer was eaten at the end. Some of the aliens were more humane than any of the humans.

The movie's newsreel style was a slight turn off at the beginning, but it grew on me. The foreshadowing was a key part of the picture. Hinting at regular intervals at what was coming, kept my interest in the movie. The special effects were very good. The character development, except for the main character, was very limited. The mother ship just hanging over the city was a cool special effect. The parallels of the treatment of aliens in the movie and apartheid were strange.

The movie is deeper than one thinks at an initial viewing. The movie stays with me and I keep coming back to the themes it presents. The movie is very subtle in some ways. I strongly recommend the movie.",1269216000,2,1330,4.469135802469136
3981661,4,B002SJIO5O,"In the special features, director and co-writer Neill Blomkamp makes an explicit statement that this movie is first and foremost for the purpose of Entertainment. To his credit, he is obviously an astute observer of the human condition and the story that makes its way to the screen is more than just entertainment.

The main story follows a story of how two individuals, hostile aliens to one-another, find a level of commonness where it wouldn't have seemed possible from a casual outside perspective (as cleverly illustrated by the initial perspective of a documentary that flows into a more conventional 3rd person narration). It is a story of how we treat ""others,"" in the guise of extraterrestrial aliens and human aliens who live outside of the mainstream. Woven throughout the tale are layers upon layers of us-versus-them themes and the demeaning consequences each has on our existence.

Beyond this informed tale of relationships is a blisteringly paced action thriller pitting a ruthless paramilitary corporation against a hapless group of refugees and a man who finds himself literally torn between the worlds. While the science fiction is pretty poorly imagined (Blomkamp admits that he didn't work hard on this aspect), the choreography of the action is intense and visceral; a well done amalgam that takes pieces from just about any decent sci-fi action movie you can think of.... And for those inclined to enjoy dark, sometimes bleak humor, you'll find a fair amount here.

So other than the weak science, District 9 is riveting. Prepare to experience a brutal world of extreme alienation, and hope that we might grow away from the tendency towards this sort of dystopia some day.",1269129600,2,1696,5.093525179856115

You might raise an eyebrow when you consider that it was done on a lower budget, $30 million, than your average Hollywood flick but that passes.  The Johannesburg locations are certainly exotic.  The analogy to apartheid is trite and obvious.  This flick certainly isn't in the same league as ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" or the first two ""Alien"" movies.

This is where the main human characters are introduced, the most interesting one is Wikus played by Sharlto Copley.

The movie is all over the place in terms of the story but things are rarely boring for one thing it was a very fast paced movie and I found myself glued to the screen even though I find most Sci-Fi movies cliched.

After reading the synopsis and noticing it was by Peter Jackson, I thought this would be a good movie so I took a chance and rented it.  I guess I'm a straightforward no nonsense regular everyday sci-fi kinda guy because I saw nothing in this movie that interested me.  The beginning was way too long and just boring.  It was done as if you were watching the news on television with fake news banners and such.  The only problem was it was full of over the top silliness defeating the purpose of making it seem real.  After 20 minutes of the fake news stuff, I knew I wouldn't like the movie and I didn't.  The acting was silly and the situations the actors were in were silly.  I guess this movie was supposed to parallel the reality of today in showing us how ugly humans are to people (aliens) not of their own kind.  That would have been great except do it in a more serious movie for such a serious topic.  Why would you try to present a serious topic such as racism with over acted, silliness.  Anyway, there are a lot of good reviews for this movie but I'm not sure why.  I've seen it before where reviewers give a movie high praise because it's a thinkin man's movie that has some way out intellectual hidden meaning that the rest of us won't get because we aren't smart enough.  Well, whatever!!!!  I didn't like it and just wanted to give an honest impression.  As mentioned earlier, I think the premise behind the movie was a good one.  I also think that it's great, not to mention difficult, to come up with something that hasn't been done before in the Sci-Fi genre.  However, when you lose sight of the primary goal of a movie which is to entertain then nothing else matters.  There are plenty of 5 star and 1 star ratings for this flick.  So, you either love it or hate it.  Just make sure that you know what type of movie this is first before investing your time or money.

3981670,4,B002SJIO5O,"Movies about aliens on earth have been popular going back to the black & white days, so it is really hard to come up with something new and original.  There have been several that were noteworthy.  Maybe the first was the original War of the Worlds, followed by The Day the Earth Stood Still, in which we encounter the god-like aliens who come not to destroy, enslave or uplift mankind, but to discipline us.  Spielberg released the next two milestones.  Close Encounters of the Third Kind was probably the first movie to really explore how individuals, communities, and governments would react to the appearance of UFO's.  E.T. personalized the encounter and put a friendly, if not humanoid face on the otherwordly visitors.  Both movies also featured the most memorable soundtracks of alien movies.  After this, special effects and CGI become widespread and Hollywood is annually producing at least one expensive, though not always profitable, movie about aliens landing on earth.  Examples include Independence Day, Starship Troopers, X-files, Starman, Predator, Superman (remember, he is from Krypton), etc..  However, after E.T., none of them has ever earned a major nomination from the Acadamy Awards until District 9.

Produced as an indie film, and set in South Africa of all places, District 9 is probably the best alien invasion movie this decade.  All the norms of alien films are turned upside down; the aliens are technologically advanced, but not advanced enough to keep themselves out a slum.  And instead of having smooth skins with nice uni-color suits; they look like prawns.  And they love catfood.  And instead of coming to Earth as visitors, conquerors or predators, they got stuck here, either lost or as refugees.  This is the backstory of District 9.  The main plot is about a bureaucrat who is accidentally exposed to some sort of biowarfare agent, and begins to transform into an alien.  As this occurs, he is hunted down by humans who want his body for various reasons.

This movie is superficially a sci-fi action flick, but it also has scenes of tragedy, comedy, suspense, and drama.  In short, it is a complete movie that explores the human condition in many aspects.  I however did not think it deserved a best picture nomination from the Acadamy Awards as there were too many plot holes in it.  Many of these are highlighted in other reviews for this movie, so I will list the most visible ones.  First of, why isn't the area below the spaceship evacuated?  Second, the aliens clearly own superior technology in terms of military hardware.  Why don't they use this hardware to free themselves from their slum?  Third, how did Wikus and his alien friend, Christopher, manage to escape District 9 and navigate to the MNU corporate headquarters without anyone noticing them?  Fourth, why did Wikus not see a doctor after being exposed to the black liquid.  He knows he is sick, especially after his fingernails start coming of.

So overall a good movie, but not a great one.  But as an indie movie, it was probably the best indie movie of 2009.  For its low budget, the special effects, cinematography, set design, costume design, basically everything technical, is spot on and up to par with any big budget Hollywood flick.  This is telling, and highlights how expensive big name actors and actresses are, and how their salaries tend to comprise the biggest chunk of big movie costs.

3981671,5,B002SJIO5O,"To start, I never read reviews before I see a film because I want to approach it with unbiased eyes the first time I see it. I never got a chance to see this one last year and when I caught a clip of Wickus throwing the cat food as a ""distraction"" well, I just had to see this movie.

I was pleasantly surprised at how awesome this movie was. I didn't really have high hopes for it going in, because from what I had seen it looked low budg and silly, but boy was I wrong! I enjoyed this much more than AVATARD (which I found myself constantly rolling my eyes at the cheesy dialogue and cliche storyline). This is much more entertaining the TURD LOCKER which was about as exciting as watching cheese grow mold.

Why did I like this movie? Here are a few reasons:

1) Amazing special effects. Very believable CGI with few hiccups.
2) It was funny (at least in the beginning. Then it gets serious later. I think the tongue-in cheek aspect works very well for introducing you into this film, though it is hard to sustain an entire story that way. That is why I think they changed to a more serious tone later.)
3) Cool alien guns. Ok, it's pretty primal but, WOW, their were some awesome guns!
4) The most amazing mech ever seen in film. I really was so enthralled with it, and they better bring back more in the sequel.
5) Entertaining from start to finish. I literally could not take my eyes off the screen. I found myself missing things if I did. Something interesting is always going on, not to mention the story pulls you the whole way through.
6) Original. Okay, how many alien invasion/ visitor or variants there of have there been? It's a sci-fi staple. To come to the table with something fresh and watchable in this arena is commendable indeed.
7) I actually cared about the outcome. I found myself rooting for the aliens at the end. Compare this to AVATARD where I didn't give one billy-goats fart how things ended because I already knew what was going to happen. And the Na'vi were lame anyway. Some people say that AVATARD is just ripping off Dances with Wolves. That's not the problem. The problem is it doesn't do it well. District nine 1takes basically the same idea but succeeds. Why? Because the guy is being inducted into the alien culture against his will! A great take on the premise that works for me.

The only real thing wrong with the movie, IMO, is the change from goofy, tongue-in-cheek sci-fi flick to over-serious action-drama. I can understand why they did it, and for the most part it works, but it was a little confusing as to whether they were being serious or not. I think the movie started to take it self too seriously and should have stuck more with the tone in the beginning. Still an awesome movie though.",1268438400,3,2740,4.409090909090909
3981672,4,B002SJIO5O,"Here is a movie that took a while for me to get around to watching due to some comments about how 'boring the first half is' but I can honestly say I found District 9 very entertaining from START to finish.

Furthermore,how a movie like 'Hurt locker' (which I thought was just ok) recieved such acclaim (well,by some,the noisy,dollar empowered few I'll wager) and District 9 seemed to (unfairly imo) go without recognition is another reminder of who controls the dollar.

So,District 9 for me is a movie that has good story,a convincing and very well acted lead (along with good supporting cast),good scripting,excellent visuals (note in 1:85,not 2:35 so no letterboxing for the majority of us widescreen TV owners).(The picture from start to finish was excellent quality - no blurry scenes mixed with some grainy scenes then some pristine scenes,just consistent demo material).
Also the HD sound track was excellent and topped off this HD gem.

Furthermore,on top of some of the racial statements this movie presents (not in a pro negative perspective imo) it also goes into deeper territory with a few not so unobvious messages that tie in with the book of revelation from the Bible.(Mark of the beast for example for the impatient/curious).

An easy recommend from me especially for the HD sci/fi lover.",1268438400,,1306,4.977064220183486
3981673,4,B002SJIO5O,"I have heard a wide variety of opinions concerning ""District 9"", and it seems as though folks either love or hate this film. Not sure why I put off watching it for so long, but I finally popped it in last night.

At first I had a lot of reservations about the flick. The ""hand held shaky"" cam thing has been done to death with ""Cloverfield"", ""Quarantine"" & ""Diary of the Dead"". But there is a good reason a majority of the film is presented in this format which is laid out right at the beginning of the film. And while there are many scenes shot with the hand held camera, quite a bit of the film is shot in conventional style as well.

The basic storyline is that aliens have come to Earth, most likely by accident, but we are never really told for sure. They've been living among us now for almost 3 decades and now must reside in a slum known as district 9. Crime is out of control, human citizens of Johannesburg want the aliens (prawns) taken out of the city. And as the film begins, we meet a low level bureaucrat who has been put in charge of relocating the aliens to a spot 200 miles outside of the city. Neither the aliens or the Nigerian gang who control the black market in district 9 want to relocate...and both are willing to kill to keep it from happening.

I see some folks drawing similarities between ""District 9"" and a host of other Sci-Fi films, but I still think this is one of the most original films to come out in theaters the past couple years.

The special effects are amazing. I normally hate CGI effects in a movie. More often than not they look like cartoons, but the CGI animation in ""District 9"" is phenomenal. The ""prawns"" look amazing, and for big buggy aliens, they somehow are still able to display a wide variety of emotion. The action is top notch, but this isn't a straight action flick, the action takes a backseat to the storyline and the characters. If you like a little more depth to your sci-fi I highly recommend you pick this up.",1268352000,,1974,4.3126684636118595
3981674,1,B002SJIO5O,"Let me start by saying, I'm a woman who enjoys some science fiction and many guy-type movies.  I loved Blade Runner and all the Alien movies, liked Videodrome and A Boy and His Dog.  I love the 3 Stooges and own both Jackass movies.

So I was all set to like this movie, or at least view it with thoughtfulness and an open mind.  Or, maybe, just be entertained.  Nothing wrong with that.

Was I ever in for a shock.  Talk about cinematic crap.  Aside from the special effects, I found nothing to redeem this movie.

About halfway, maybe two thirds of the way through, I simply turned my eyes from the screen and stared at the wall for the rest of the film.  Not because the violence bothered me -- please -- but simply because I was sick of seeing the same thing, again, and again, and again, and again.

However I did listen to the rest of the movie, and for reasons I'll give below, I don't think I missed anything and that I can still provide a valid review.

Here are the movie's messages.  They're quite simple, as you can see.

*  Old white men in suits are evil.

*  Army colonels are evil.

*  Humans mistreat those who are different.

Now, before the fans  start hollering:  yes, I am aware that all of the above are true -- sometimes.  But in D9, they're always true.  There are no shades of gray, no subtleties, no mitigating circumstances, no questions raised, no thoughts provoked.  Of course the above statements have their place in movies, books, whatever.  But for cripe's sake I want an author/director who puts some thought into the work, who presents different dimensions.  With D9 I felt I was watching a chimpanzee slap paint on a wall.

I tired of it very quickly, and found the wall much more interesting to study.

Now, why do I feel that, even with my eyes shut, I missed nothing of importance?  Because I kept hearing the following elements.  Repeatedly.  Until I felt they were etched in acid on my brain:

1.  Weapon fire and explosions.

2.  Splats.

3.  Clicks, grunts, croaks, that were the prawns vocalizing.

4.  Shouted dialogue, consisting of variations on the word ""fook.""  ""fookin hell!""  ""What the fook ya doin!"" etc.

5.  String instrument orchestrations.

6.  Phone-baloney, semi operatic, wailing, quavering vocalizations, sometimes over a background composed of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  I assumed that at these times something serious was going on.

The above six elements happened in no particular order, sometimes two or three went on at once, but it was basically the same sounds, repeated ad nauseum.  The soundtrack for this movie must have been the easiest one in the world to compose.  A person could mark six sides of a die/dice, and toss it a hundred times, and come up with a soundtrack for District 9.

See it if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you.",1268006400,27,2799,4.531187122736418
3981675,4,B002SJIO5O,"The Bottom Line:

District 9 does a lot of things right and offers some compelling science-fiction entertainment, so I'm able to forgive the fact that in the last half hour all ideas are thrown out the window in favor of nonstop action and poor characterizations (e.g. the Nigerians who show up so we can have another villain in the film); it's an intriguing film and at times a powerful one, but it could have been so much more.

It was hard to watch at first because it is filmed partially in a documentary style and when humans gave their opinions of the aliens, my heart broke because I knew that the attitudes and descriptions imparted by those interviewed were similar to how the whites described blacks during the period of apartheid in South Africa.  The same kind of disdain for another living being.

Anyway, after I stopped the film and collected myself and then thought.... ""this is a like any other sci fi movie.""  I turned it back on sat back with some chips and thoroughly enjoyed this film.

Yeah, they're aliens and they are not cute like E.T but one cannot help but root for them because the humans who were supposed to help them treated them terribly.  Turned many of them into addicts, did horrible experiments on them and I hate bullies so....

This movie had everything in it from humor to action to even a sweet moment between an alien parent and their child.

3981678,1,B002SJIO5O,"It was no fun watching this movie, either. The makers of this film have limited knowledge of human motives, emotions, and organization. To say that the display of human reaction to the arrival of an interstellar spacecraft was indifferent is an understatement.  Every human in the movie treats the presence of aliens on earth as a nuisance and a burden. There is no fear, no awe, no desire to learn their story, and other than the typical evil government/corporate cliche trying to copy their weapons, there is no wonder at the advanced alien technology of which there is an ever-present reminder hanging in the South African sky (I would have said Johannesburg sky, but the spacecraft is so huge it must be visible for hundreds of miles). Even more remiss is the lack of a single scene where a human ponders the fate of humanity, now that beings from another planet have arrived. In fact the disregard for safety is so pronounced that humans board their ship without fear of contamination and then decide that these physically dangerous and technologically advanced creatures from another world should stay as our guests. In later scenes we see that alien artifacts, including weapons, are everywhere amongst the aliens and humans who share the shantytowns together. In reality the governments of the world would have removed any human presence under the spacecraft, put a lockdown on access to the ship, and would study it and its contents forever. The end. Any variation on that story would come from the discoveries made and/or the actions of the aliens. The filmmakers could have contrived an interesting plot from that scenario, but instead we get a ridiculous parable about immigration policy.",1267833600,34,1700,4.985915492957746
3981679,5,B002SJIO5O,"This film is an experiment in relatively low budget filmmaking based on an interesting concept.  Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings trilogy) acts as producer for newbie director Neill Blomkamp and a script by Blomkamp and Terri Tacthell to create an imaginative, powerful film whose DNA is civil strife in South Africa.  Much as High Noon was about the Communist `witch hunts' of the late 1940's and The Sand Pebbles was a corollary to the Vietnam War, District 9 smacks of Apartheid commentary in its home setting of Johannesburg, South Africa.  The results are a well made science fiction film that integrates an important message.

A government civil servant worker named Wikus Van De Merwe leads a relocation of an alien race dubbed `The Prawns' from their current home in District 9 to a camp in a different part of South Africa.  The military also wants to make use of the sophisticated alien weaponry that can only be operated by the aliens DNA.

Wikus leads a group of soldiers into an alien camp and during the confrontation, he finds a mysterious vile that explodes when opened and splashes his face with an unknown substance.  And quicker than you can say, The Fly, he starts to notice some startling changes as his body becomes nauseous and altered.  A reunion at home with his wife and friends becomes a tragic start of something ominous and, when the military realizes the unlimited value of Wikus' genetic ability to operate the alien weaponry, he becomes a hunted fugitive.

Trying to find refuge in the alien camp, he locates one of the aliens who concocted the substance. And the two devise a plan to steal the liquid now in military custody.  The alien needs the material for his ship and, in exchange, he will help Wikus.  Can he be trusted? How fast before Wikus changes completely?  Back in District 9, the alien attempts to liftoff in his ship with his son, and Wikus has similar plans to escape.  Soon the military catches up to them for an explosive climax.  At that moment, Wikus makes a momentous decision that will change his life and the fate of his alien companion.

The mostly unknown cast is uniformly excellent and capably led by Sharlto Copley as Wikus.  Technical credits are superior particularly makeup and visual effects.  Good use is made of a periodic timeline to show the passage of time and development of the events.  Lots of handheld cameras and lack of a musical score lend a feeling of immediacy and reality.  Told in a quasi-documentary style through flashbacks and interviews, the film takes on a realistic aura grounded in truth.  Rarely has a science fiction film (Cloverfield) ever been presented in this convincing manner.  This is narrative driven and doesn't let up.  Once it begins, you have to hang on for dear life.

A number of topics are ever present throughout the film including segregation and racism, military dominance, and ultimately love.  Do aliens have rights? Do they have a soul?  It's a great premise for a film that the filmmakers take and expand upon.  There is the use of private military contractors, and instead of oil, the resource the military seeks is superior technology in weaponry.

The film has elements of other films like Alien Nation, Black Hawk Down and Starship Troopers.  It's not for all tastes but for those who appreciate this genre with a moral twist, it is a rewarding experience.  The action is graphic and unrelenting as the stakes get higher.  As violent and startling as some of the scenes are-no punches pulled here, there is a noble theme that is never lost.  What comes through in District 9 is its humanity amid the aliens and hardware, and the final shot cannot help but be affecting.  Wow, an independent science fiction film with state of the art technical effects and a compelling, intimate story.  Where do I sign up?",1267747200,,3822,4.777439024390244
3981680,4,B002SJIO5O,"Making some interesting points about how people often interact with minority groups, ""District 9"" is more than your standard story about aliens. An alien ship has come to Earth and the aliens have been forced to live in a shantytown in South Africa for 20 years. The movie focuses on how people treat these new neighbors. There are graphic scenes with dead and mutilated bodies (mostly alien) plus weapons which tear people apart, so it isn't for the squeamish. Personally, I cringed a bit at the start but got used to the nauseating parts about halfway through the movie. The story is rather interesting, the acting is decent, and the directing is well done, so it was worth it. The aliens done by Weta, the same company behind ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Avatar"", are very different and yet realistic.

There are basically two parts to this movie - the documentary-style build-up showing the conditions the aliens are forced to live in, and the pursuit after one of the humans starts to cooperate with the aliens. The human in question, Wikus, is in charge of a team from MNU, a weapons corporation designated to evict the aliens from their shanties so they can be moved to even smaller concentration camp style quarters. At the start Wikus dislikes the prawns (a derogatory term for the aliens) as much as anyone. During the eviction operation, Wikus accidentally gets exposed to a substance which starts to transform him slowly into an alien. Since the alien weaponry can only be unlocked by their DNA, Wikus becomes the one man who can fire them. Headed by his father-in-law, MNU wants the ability to utilize the weaponry at all costs, including Wikus' death.

Wikus manages to escape capture and is aided by one of the aliens and the alien's son. The alien is trying to travel home and the two form a cautious alliance. To accomplish their goals, they are up against the corporation as well as Nigerian gangs who have similar designs on using the alien weaponry. Being in close contact with the alien, Wikus learns more about them and gains a better appreciation for their situation.

One can easily draw parallels between how the humans in the movie treat the aliens and how various minority groups have been treated over time. The humans don't actively try to learn anything about the aliens; therefore, as an unknown, the aliens become something to fear and battle against. They get pushed aside and scorned. When it comes down to it though, the aliens are very much like the humans. They have similar emotions, children whom they care for, and just want to go home.",1267574400,,2572,4.749440715883669

3981682,4,B002SJIO5O,One of the most enjoyable things about district nine is the attention to detail.  From the way the aliens look to the shanty town they live in; which was presented in such a realistic way that one's attention was continuously transfixed on the images on the screen.  The heroes of the story are both tragic and heroic at the same time and the real question I left the theater wondering is if this was a prophetic tale of how we might treat our first alien visitors?  There's little doubt in my mind that the way the corporations where presented in this film was dead on accurate.  The acquisition of new and more advanced alien technology would boost any greedy companies' bank account.  This movie leaves a lot of questions unanswered at the end; but that is part of the excitement.  Were left wondering about the fates of the main characters and will the protost return in three years as promised?,1267488000,,899,4.5875
3981683,4,B002SJIO5O,"Many excellent reviews of 'District 9' have been posted, so this review will try not to tread the same ground but offer some new perspectives (if that's possible).

The film is unusual and despite some minor issues with the editing and the splatter-movie violence, seeing it is time well spent. Its original in concept and execution, repays at least a couple of repeat viewings and, surprisingly, explores quite deep and thought-provoking subject matter. It manages to be controversial and at the same the antithesis of simplistic or preachy.

A mock-documentary style is used in the first part of the film and later reprised to update the subsequent action as it might be seen or reported by other observers in the media and in the street. This is an excellent device which works effectively by telling the audience: here's a wide spectrum of different people seeing this situation from all kinds of perspectives - it's obviously a complex problem with a long history. For example, one speaker justifies a common pejorative for the visitors thus:

""Some people call them prawns. You can't say they don't look like prawns. I mean...that's what they look like""

Racist terminology is OK for non-humans because our carefully evolved societal norms don't apply to them, see?

By introducing the alien space ship and visitors as being present for 30 years the screenplay leapfrogs the ""Wow! ETs are here!"" sensationalism of first contact and fast-forwards the audience into ""...yes, but what might then happen down the line?"" Things have degenerated; the aliens are seen as a pestilence, a problem which needs to be contained. The obvious parallel is of new immigrant arrivals into any established community ending up in a sprawling, violent, filthy ghetto town: isolated, corralled, stigmatised, difficult for the authorities and the indigenous population alike. Existing ghetto gangsters - controversially portrayed as Nigerians, a recognised ""problem"" in the real present-day Johannesburg - prey on the prawns and are in turn preyed on by them: the film makers ran into some problems with the Nigerian government because of this stereotyping.

Exploitation and greed rule here. Do human rights apply to non-humans? If not, then why not? Where is the line drawn? The visitors seem to have no concept of human morality nor respect for existing law or property: they simply don't think that way, and their society does not work with those mores. Should they be managed as a pseudo-human population, or as animals, or as some third category for whom a whole new morality needs to be worked out? Again, no glib or easy answers are offered. They are tolerated and contained, and it's now been decided they need to be moved to a new ""improved"" containment away from the city.

Reportedly the arguments surrounding this film and disagreements about its message were intended by Neill Blomkamp, the director and writer. It works on one level as a violent action movie (not really to this particular reviewer's taste) and as such perhaps he was aiming to attract a younger and more easily titillated audience, who might then be led to contemplate the more thoughtful issues at the heart of the story.

Is it essentially about apartheid? Not really, it's more complex than that. Global migration, the non-integration and ghetto-ization of minority groups into human societies with older, established populations? Partly. Complex human attitudes and differing responses to a persistently threatening social situation? Yes, maybe.

The story of the main protagonist Wikus and his gradual transformation into a deeper, more aware, enlightened human being as fugitive-on-the-run is at the heart of the story. The audience perhaps never fully identifies with the flawed and essentially self-serving Wikus though he does win our sympathy and as the ""hero"" battling the world alone, the viewer is in the latter part of the film openly rooting for him. Part-hybrid echoing ""The Fly,"" his transformation is a less-than-subtle allegory for dawning empathy with the visitors' predicament.

The alien technology and weaponry looks OK for a modest-budget movie (US$30 million in comparison to Cameron's US$310 million for `Avatar') but does have a rather 1980s look about it. A greater criticism I would have is the gore-splatter violence of countless human bodies exploding complete with flying limbs and internal organs, the sheer gratuitous quantity of which does eventually anaesthetise the viewer. Maybe Blomkamp used this as a device to hook a younger audience more titillated by sensual stimulation into the movie to lead them into deeper waters. The editing is also rather messy in places, but competent enough. District 9 though is superbly realised, a cinematic recreation of an urban slum complete with squalor, chaos and an edge of danger around every corner.

The final scene returns to the talking-heads doc format and post-action comments like ""Some conspiracy theorists believe..."" a fine observation of the ubiquitous CT industry's common way of distorting reality to comply with differing belief-systems, causing the viewer to smile wisely as he/she has been party to Wikus's adventure at close quarters and can now appreciate the chasm which will open between the inevitable emerging CTs and reality. This is fine social observation at its best, a wry humorous dig at the expense of ""conspiracists"" and excellent script writing and editing.

Despite minor flaws, District 9 is an original piece of work and quite unlike anything else the cinema has seen. The subject matter of ""outsiders"" being seen as an unwanted, pestilential nuisance alone should give those who advocate ""government disclosure"" of the UFO/ET issue pause for thought. The film is certainly destined for cult classic status and I hope Blomkamp makes another movie half as good as this one.",1267228800,,5852,5.213829787234043
3981684,5,B002SJIO5O,"... considering what happened to my review of the film Avatar! A hundred thirty comments, and still coming! But I truly wonder why NOBODY has remarked on the similarity of the two films, Avatar and District 9. Not quite the same script, but mighty close: an alien species is unable to defend itself, for the time being, from Blackwater-style mercenary gunners until one Homo sapiens comes to their aid. In both films, the rescuer is a cross-breed, in Avatar by intent, in District 9 by accident. Both films end up with the half-human and the aliens blasting the baddies (us) to kingdom come. And both films have a profoundly subversive anti-capitalist message. And both films depict humans as unredeemably bloodthirsty racists. Avatar has the edge in pretty scenery and 3-D, but District 9 includes ACTING! A scruffy-looking unknown, Sharlto Copley, plays the role of the DNA-infected 'traitor' to human national and corporate greed; if Copley doesn't win some kind of Oscar for this performance, there's no justice on Earth.

By this time, I think it's safe to presume that everybody has seen both films, so I won't offer a synopsis, nor a teaser nor a spoiler. Instead, I want to outrage the usual outragees by speculating on the current mood of apocalyptic fantasy among us H-saps. There are several channels, obviously, one of extraterrestrial encounter, one of global catastrophe (that total snoozer about instant climate change comes to mind), and the third about a Day of Judgement scenario. 2012? I haven't seen it, but it must fit one of these categories. The ""Left Behind"" novels. What's up, humanity? Are we so desperately fearful of our finite and fleeting existence that we need to bolster our self-image with fantasies of Armageddon? Relax, you silly primates! If there's anyone -- or Anyone -- out there, He, She or They are not preoccupied with us.

Is this really a five-star film? Beyond the acting of Copley and the special effects, no way! It's 'kinda dopey' as we say in Minnesota. There are more logical inconsistencies in the script than in a speech by Sarah Palin. And there is a grievous problem with the depiction of the Nigerians in the film; they are stereotyped in the most racist, neo-colonial manner. Somebody ought to be ashamed.

But you have to see it, believe me, before the sequel comes out, when the aliens come back. Unless, of course, you think you can take their side ...",1267142400,,2411,4.875609756097561

3981686,4,B002SJIO5O,"Johannesburg, The Present: The Alien ship drifted into a lazy orbit over Johannesburg twenty years ago. When humanity finally cut their way inside, they found roughly one million malnourished, unhealthy insect-like Aliens dwelling within. The Aliens - derogatorily nicknamed ""Prawns"" - were relocated into a single huge refugee camp in Johannesburg known as ""District Nine"". Despite an apparent instinctual affinity for technology, the Prawns are generally considered to be of low intelligence and have been marginalised, castigated, brutalised and left to die by a largely intolerant human population which treats them with suspicion, disgust and xenophobia. With Alien/Human tensions running at an all-time high, it is decided that the Prawns should be evicted from District 9, which has degenerated into a gigantic slum of shacks, poverty and crime over twenty years, and relocated to a new district far outside the city.  MNU, a private corporation which has thus far been unable to exploit the fruits of the alien technology, is contracted to enforce the eviction and do so with their usual brutal efficiency not realising that the ruthlessness of their conduct will have devastating consequences for both human and alien alike...

As one would expect, the spectre of South Africa's Apartheid years haunt virtually every frame of Neill Blomkamp's ""District Nine"". If you are old enough to remember the horrors of that era, you can only marvel at the bravery of Blomkamp's film; partially shot in nascent semi-documentary style, I felt an old familiar sickness in my stomach as I watched Afrikaans bureaucrats - backed up by armed bully-boys - cheerfully going about the systematic eviction of oppressed and marginalised 'pariahs' from slum-dwellings whilst throwing jocular asides such as ""The Prawn does not really understand the concept of ownership, so evicting him is no great problem, hey?"". The poignancy of these scenes is all the more potent when one considers that they were shot on the outskirts of Johannesburg's Soweto township (which witnessed just exactly this kind of state endorsed barbarism during the Apartheid years).

That said, there is much more to Neill Blomkamp's film than just polemic. It is a brilliantly paced action thriller, with a very dark comic streak, which puts virtually everything made by Hollywood in recent years to shame. After watching it, I was unsurprised to discover in the extras that this project was green-lit following the collapse of producer Peter Jackson's movie of the ""Halo"" video game. Indeed, the final sequences of the film - which, despite some awesome action, for my money were the weakest - do actually resemble the action sequences from a particularly bloody first person shooter, so one wonders whether any of the production design was carried over from the aborted film.

In terms of acting, performances for the most part are brilliant, convincing and improvisatory. Praise must go to Sharlto Copley for his turn as 'Wikus', an MNU bureaucrat who finds himself reluctantly thrust into the very heart of alien/human tensions. He makes one of the most unusual leading men of recent years (think David Brent from ""The Office"" cross-pollinated with an action hero and you're getting close). This really is a film which is carried as much as by its acting as its special effects.

STARRING: Sharlto Copley, Jason Cope, Sylvaine Strike, Nathalie Boltt, John Summer and William Allen Young

WRITTEN BY: Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell

DIRECTED BY: Neill Blomkamp

Rated: R
Genre: Science Fiction
Release Date: 14 August 2009

District 9 would be a bench-mark of success for any filmmaker, let alone a first time writer and director like Neill Blomkamp. It's no surprise his film found its place among the top ten nominated for the Academy Award for best picture.

It starts off slow and is shot kind of like a documentary. I'll admit, the beginning of the film could have been done a little better, but it does serve a purpose. It sets up the characters and the film's thick underlying theme; which is prejudice and segregation.

We learn that in the 80s, an alien spices landed on Earth. Not in Manhattan or Los Angeles, but in Johannesburg, South Africa.

The alien's massive `mother ship' still hovers above the city, years after they landed. The special effects used for this little trick are flawless. Seeing as two of my picks for best special effects didn't receive nominations (2012 and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen), it's between District 9 and Avatar for the Oscar. If you think the spaceship looks cool, just wait till you see the creatures.

They reminded me of a cross between The Fly and Predator. Because of this, they are referred to as the slur name `prawns.' After the humans become agitated by their presence (some twenty years later) they put forth an effort to have them sanctioned off, into a lower-status-quo part of town referred to as `District 9'. Should they refuse, they are terminated.

Our hero is Wickus, played by a newbie by the name of Sharlto Copley. You can expect to see a lot more of this guy, because he was brilliant. Matter of fact, he's already going to be starring opposite Liam Neeson, Jessica Biel and Bradley Cooper in the upcoming action flick, The A-Team.

It's no wonder Sharlto was interested in the material, as he was born a native of Johannesburg. Add on the fact that the film was produced by Peter Jackson, and he seems like a pretty smart dude to me.

As the film is filled with intense action sequences and grizzly alien images, I'm sure a great number of its viewers will miss these important political analogies all together. If we are lucky, maybe they'll listen to the audio commentary.",1266364800,,2386,4.764563106796117

If it didn't have as much of it as it had, I would give it five stars. Other then that it was really good. Especially on the part of the aliens.",1266364800,2,439,4.116279069767442

The gritty documentary style literally sucks the viewer in to the world created so expertly by Peter Jackson.  The perspective of the film moves from present day to past and back in smooth story telling transitions.  The  in medias res beginning makes the movie feel so unique and ""lived in.""  The film is ""real"" in many aspects.  It feels much like a history channel program while at the same time portrays real ""human"" emotion and often depravity.  This is all mixed with an intriguing plot, and sci-fi action.  All in all, DISTRICT 9 is a brilliant movie executed perfectly.  The political sarcasm is fantastic.  The film is not at all what one expects, and this fact is what creates the extreme pleasure the film delivers.",1266364800,3,857,4.677852348993288

3981710,3,B002SJIO5O,"This flick is extremely imaginative, although I feel obligated to note that its basic theme has a fair amount in common with ""Alien Nation."" The film is done mostly in documentary form. A huge alien spacecraft comes to rest over Johannesburg, South Africa. Eventually humans board the ship and find about 1 million destitute and starving aliens. Due to their crustacean-looking appearance, they are derogatorily nicknamed ""prawns."" The film revolves around a scenario in which the South African government seeks to relocate the ""prawns"" to a reservation in the South African hinterlands, away from the big city.

There is not much in the way of characterization in this film.  Part of this is because the aliens themselves are essentially portrayed mostly as ignorant slum-dwellers who mainly only speak their own language. The poor treatment meted out to the aliens is, unfortunately, all too plausible and this is the real point of this film.

This one is worth a try for science fiction aficionados and given its limited budget and lack of big-star cast, it is impressive in its own way. RJB.",1266105600,,1095,5.038674033149171

The directors tried to make it documentary style but the interviews and filming comes off feeling like a bad rendition of 'the office'.  Half of the movie consists of the main character (the south african version of the guy from 'the office') running around screaming 'f@#$' and shooting unrealistic guns at walls and aliens.  Brainless plot, action and dialogue. At the end of the movie I felt sick from the nausea inducing camera work and the overall disgustingness of the film.  And don't be fooled that this movie attacks apartheid, it is actually trying to explain WHY and HOW EASY the white south africans subjugated the blacks.  In the film we see blacks screaming for the aliens to be locked up and you can sense the white south african director smiling and saying, 'see, they want to lock up the dirty, disgusting, dangerous, scum as well!!'
Overall, a disgusting, tasteless, moronic movie that will leave you sick to your stomach.  Unless of course, you are the average imbecile who is desensitized to all of the violence and sadomasochism of our sorry 'culture' and enjoys GUNS GUNS AND MORE GUNS!!

3981720,5,B002SJIO5O,"I've always wondered why, in science fiction movies dealing with human/alien contact, the aliens are almost always the bad guys.  It's always them invading us, or us getting out there and meeting with aliens who turn out to be midlessly vicious or innately evil.  Assuming that there are probably a lot of alien civilizations in the hundred billion odd galaxies in the universe, it's not unreasonable to think that some of them will turn out to be warlike.  But we know that humans have launched wars more than occasionally, so it always seemed to me that there should be some alien invasion movies where the humans are the invaders, or some where aliens arrive at Earth and are greeted by humanity's mean side (""Alien Nation"" did this quite a while back, but it was one of the few).  Also, there seemed to be missed opportunities in that in the human/alien conflicts, wouldn't there be situations where neither side was all bad or all good?

  Well over the last year or two these very concepts have clearly gotten their day, and District 9 is one of the leaders of the pack.  While not being a totally black-or-white scenario, the human response in this first contact situation turns out not to be as noble as one would like, and disturbingly realistic with numerous real-life parralells.

  A massive alien ship enters Earth's atmosphere and rather than hovering over a city like New York or London, ends up over Johannesberg, South Africa, in what's soon to turn out to be an unfortunate irony.  The ship is broken down, out of supplies, doesn't have the ability to communicate, and is packed with what appear to be starving refugees.  Upon the initial arrival of the ship, the whole world is excited at the prospect of contact and the dawn of a new era.  Upon the initial discovery of the aliens's sad state, the whole world is prepared to pitch in and help the hundreds of thousands of new arrivals.  Flash forward twenty years, though, and it's a far grimmer picture.  No new era has dawned with man being inducted into interstellar society or reaping the economic benefits of contact with and trade with a technologically advanced civilization.  Humanity has never figured out how the alien tech worked and was therefore never able to tap into its potential benefits.  Most of the surviving aliens, even after communication, were no more able to explain how everything functioned than the average modern human passenger on a commercial airplane would be able to tell a stone age tribe how to build their own jets.  The aliens, referred to by humans as 'prawns' (a label considered derisive by many of the aliens) apparantly can't return home, and the costs of housing and accomodating their growing population became something the world started to get tired of.  It also cost a lot to try and figure out how to work their technology, especially their weapons (of huge interest to the nations of the world) and no benefit came from that either.  So twenty years later, rather than being honored guests, the aliens are crammed into a poverty-ridden ghetto in the middle of Johannesberg in a situation that not only bears an uncomfortable resemblance to South Africa's apartheid past, but to other world situations past and present.  Humanity, once so fascinated with the aliens, is tired of them and views them as a burden.  And inside the ghetto known as 'District 9', the 'prawns' have reacted to their deprived state, their seemingly dead-end future, and the hostility of much of the world around them, in the same way humans in the same situations do: they've lost hope, they're attempting to eke out meager livings on the bottom rungs of society (salvaging human landfills for junk and scrap metal, for example), some of them have turned violent in a new prawn undersociety of alien thugs, and many of them have become substance addicts (in the aliens's case, to catfood, originally simply a cheap meal that no one anticipated would have such an addictive effect on their alien physiology).  Human society has attempted to limit the prescence of these 'undesirables' in appalingly familiar ways - confining them to their own ghetto and not letting them out, population control measures (even including forced abortions, in a highly disturbing angle), and now, finally, the time has come that Jonnasberg has decided that they want the aliens out of the city altogether and a private military contractor is preparing to move them - by force if necessary - to a camp in the desert that will be known as District Ten.

  We see much of the movie through the eyes of Wikus Van De Merwe (a great performance by Sharlto Copley), a civilian official working with private contractor MNU, and here's part of where the movie picks up its ""not black or white"" status: Wikus doesn't see himself as a bad guy, or as 'anti-prawn'; he's aware that the current situation is horrid, is aware that the solution of forcible relocation has all kinds of practical and moral flaws, but seems to see it as the best available option.  He's also guilty himself on at least a couple of occasions of some horrifying actions, but he doesn't view it that way, partly because he's not relating to the alien people the way he would to human people; he actually seems to think he's doing the best thing for them. It's only when some totally unexpected events make Wikus an outsider himself, and he and some of the aliens are forced to work together, that he begins to see the brutality of their daily situation more clearly, and the cold ruthlessness of the private contactor he's been affiliated with.  Also adding to the ""not black or white"" angle: some of the prawns Do come off as bad guys - certain ones are beligerant, crude and violent.  If humanity was to judge the prawns ONLY on those representatives they'd have good reason to be wary.  Two obvious real-life parallels here: the folly of judging an entire group or race only by its worst members; and the fact that we're seeing the prawns After years of ill treatment.  Were the nasty ones that violent to begin with, or is it, to at least some degree, a consequence of the way they've been treated?  There's another level to the run-down state of the alien society on Earth, and this one doesn't really have real-life parallels because it's based on alien physiologies and technologies and so on.  It's not asked outright, but it's pretty clear in the subtext - did whatever happened to cripple their ship originally have some direct effect on the aliens themselves, either physically or psychologically?

  In the first ten minutes or so of District 9, it became abundantly clear that it was a very well-done movie, but I also thought I might be in for one of the most depressing movies ever made.  It's not though.  There are tragic and melancholy parts to it, even depressing parts, but oh, there are also some parts that are just jaw-droppingly Awesome.  The movie runs the gamut through all kinds of tragedy and triumph, unexpected plot turns, characters changing their points of view both on other individuals and on whole situations, several major turning points.  The prawn aliens are very individualized, with their own personalities, temperaments, etc. - they're as much Characters as the human characters, not just a bunch of aliens where one is indistinguisable from another.  An alien named Christopher Johnson (they all have names that humans can pronounce and would be familiar with in addition to the names in their own click-language, which a number of humans can understand but none are physically capable of speaking) and his young son become major players in a series of unexpected events that also involve Wikus.

  Highly cerebral with great action, tremendous visuals, memorable characters and high tension, District 9 is great on all levels.  Highly recommended, although certain disturbing or bloody scenes may be more than many scence fiction fans are used to.  Although really, there's no other way they could have filmed this and had it be as effective.  Recommended for all except young children.",1265846400,,8065,4.83551673944687

3981723,5,B002SJIO5O,"This is a very good movie.

The movie is set in South Africa, and it's very easy to fall into the trap of drawing parallels to that country's history in race relations. But that is very lazy and simplistic because, in reality, this story wouldn't have been much different if it had been set in the US, Europe or Asia. The story is about one group's fear and hatred of something or someone perceived as ""other."" It's about how that ""other"" can then be degraded into something looked on as inferior, and how that attitude is accepted by the first group to justify the mistreatment and abuse of the second. This was not a phenomenon exclusive to South Africa during apartheid, but a universal issue unfolding in one way or another everywhere in the world. After all, it's very easy to suspect, fear and hate something or someone that can be reduced to a ""prawn.""

The movie does exploit the darker side of humanity, but it does so taking into account thousands of years of well-documented human history. It doesn't require much of a jump of the imagination to visualize the scenario portrayed in ""District 9"" when one takes into account the atrocities that humans perpetrate on each other every day with seemingly no end in sight. Therefore, it wasn't difficult for the creative team to imagine how we would treat an alien species that, although highly sophisticated, have suffered a tragedy during their voyage that left them extremely vulnerable.

The film can be difficult to watch because it sets up a mirror in front of viewers and forces them to confront their negative qualities and attitudes towards those they perceive as ""other."" Some viewers may find this extremely disturbing and heavy-handed. But the truth of our collective selfishness isn't pretty to look at if it has your face on it.

The movie's open-ended story (both at the start and ending) invites the viewer to try and fill in the blanks about the aliens because there is not much known and understood about them by the humans. Some published critics have suggested that the open-ended story invites a sequel. That may be so, but I hope that the story is left as is. It is far more valuable if the end is left unresolved.",1265760000,,2191,4.697916666666667

3981727,4,B002SJIO5O,"It's strange to call a science-fiction thriller eerily captivating, but first-time feature director Neill Blomkamp has somehow managed to earn that description with a most unexpected twist on the alien invasion genre of films. Based on a six-minute short, ""Alive in Joburg"", he made back in 2005, director/co-screenwriter Neill Blomkamp has fashioned a propulsive, corking adventure film that manages to be a thoughtful allegory on xenophobia, corporate greed, and due to its South African location, apartheid. What is most fascinating about the screenplay co-written by Terri Tatchell is that the aliens are not positioned to the viewer as an unknown force ready to destroy mankind, as is usually the case, but rather as an escalating socio-political ""situation"" to which the South African government respond by assigning a multinational corporation to transport them from a ramshackle, inner-city shantytown called District 9 to another area outside of Johannesburg.

Turning our expectations upside down, Blomkamp reveals an obviously powerful alien species rendered helpless on earth by their refugee status and relegated to criminal acts. In mock-documentary style, the story begins with a series of interviews explaining the back story for the aliens. A gigantic spaceship hovers over Johannesburg in 1982 (shades of Roland Emmerich's 1996&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Independence-Day/dp/B00005V9IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Independence Day</a>) where an exploratory team discovers over a million malnourished aliens onboard without a leader. They are tall bipeds with insect-like faces and crustacean-like bodies (looking very much like Jeff Goldblum's fully transformed title character in David Cronenberg's 1986 remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fly/dp/B0009X768W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fly</a>). Over the next two decades, the aliens conform to their squalid surroundings and engage in destructive behavior that raises the ire of the local residents who call them derogatorily ""prawns"". An officious Afrikaan field operative named Wikus Van De Merwe has been assigned the unenviable task of serving eviction notices to the aliens and confiscating their weaponry.

On one particular raid, Van De Merwe inadvertently sprays himself with a mysterious liquid that mutates his DNA to take on alien characteristics. He is shunted to District 9 where he relies on a more thoughtful alien named Christopher Johnson to help him reverse the transformation process. Before that can happen, the multinational corporation wants Van De Merwe for his new-found ability to handle alien weaponry (which humans cannot operate). There is also trouble brewing with Nigerian gangs eventually leading to a violent melee that decides the fate of not only Van De Merwe but also the aliens on earth. Blomkamp decided to cast a first-time feature actor, Sharlto Copley, as Van De Merwe, and he is quite effective in the role. At first, he appears to be a geeky corporate lackey married to the boss's daughter and intent on carrying forth his undesirable mission with little trepidation. Copley manages to show his character's arc in not only the manifestation of graphic effects but also through the sinking dejection he experiences as an evolving alien.

All the aliens are CGI-generated, and kudos belong to the visual effects team headed by Dan Kaufman, Peter Muyzers, Robert Habros, and Matt Aitken for giving them a scarifying look to contrast their increasingly vulnerable state. Make no mistake that despite the film's grander statements regarding the detrimental impact of social segregation, it turns primarily into a man-on-the-run (or should I say ""alien-on-the-run"") B-style thriller with eye-wincing horror elements. There is a robust set of extras with the two-disc 2010 DVD set. The first disc contains 25 minutes of deleted scenes, a strong making-of documentary, and an engaging commentary track from Blomkamp. The second disc is on the light side, offering four featurettes which detail various aspects of the production, but unfortunately, there is no sign of the original short, ""Alive in Joburg"".",1265673600,2,4213,5.847154471544715

3981729,5,B002SJIO5O,"Often disjointed, and filmed in documentary style, District 9 is a parable, a cautionary tale, and great sci-fi.  As the story unfolds, the very worst of human nature is revealed through the character of Wikas, an Everyman, whose powerful father in law runs the organization known as MUA.  Wikas is in charge of relocating the alien residents of the shantytown known as District 9 to a 'better' ghetto known as District 8, farther from Johannesburg.  Wikas is very proud of his new responsibility and hams it up for the documentary camera as it follows him around his office, in the vehicle en route to District 9, and as he and his team knock on doors, alternately cajoling and threatening the 'prawns' into signing the eviction order.  Wikas stumbles onto the prawns' secret though his patronizing paternalism leaves him blind as to its significance.

Things begin to deteriorate for Wikas, and in a lesser movie, his misfortunes would cause his evolution into a hero.  Instead, he's so hapless, MUA and Wikas' father-in-law seem twice as evil as they move to crush him and the prawns. There are lots of bad guys in this movie, and very few good guys.  Wikas runs afoul of everyone, and finds out firsthand about the life he so cavalierly imposed on the prawns. I don't think revealing this much of the plot will spoil the movie for anyone.

District 9 is thought provoking, stark and cynical.  According to the filmmakers, mankind has learned nothing from history, and will continue to marginalize and mistreat the powerless until they rebel.  It's a brilliant movie, difficult to watch. It took me two tries to get through it, but it's haunted me ever since.  THAT'S a good movie!",1265673600,,1684,4.8125

""I have never wanted to walk out of a movie so bad in my entire life.... do not ever go see district nine... id rather have a root canal... several of them...without the anesthesia... seriously... this is torture...shoot me.""

Could not have said it better. District 9 is beyond bad. It is downright offensive to anybody with an IQ over 65.

This is what other viewers said after seeing this movie:

"" This is the worst ever, and there is not even a close second. How is it even possible that this movie made it to DVD, let alone movie theaters?

. . . And for the punch line? It just got nominated for an Academy Award for--get this--Best Picture.""

""One of the worst movies I've ever actually sat through from start to finish. I hated all of the characters in the movie and wanted all of them to die. I've enjoyed those cheesy made for tv movies on SyFy channel a lot more than this piece of garbage. A total waste of my money and time.""

"" WORST movie i think i have ever seen. someone that could possibly even like this movie is a freak beyond belief. if you want to see people being blown up... go see this movie, youll have a blast. if you want to here people swearing like hell in south african accents be my guest. this is the most bizzare, and disgusting film i have ever in my entire life seen.""

""by far one of the absolute worst movies ever made the main actor was an annoying incompetent moron/geek i hated every single minute of this waste of time film ""

""District 9 is the worst piece of crap ever made! If I could sue Peter Jackson and the makers of this film I would. If I was offered a million dollars cash in a briefcase to watch this movie again I would open the briefcase, barf on the cash and politely pass! In no way is this clever film-making! This was simply a scam to rip off the general public! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

"" have just finished watching District 9 on DVD and I agree with the majority. It has to be one of the worst pieces of ""film making"" I have ever seen. The plot was a ridiculous. I know it had a moral story to tell with regards to modern discrimination, but it was done in a very silly way. What angered me the most was that at no time was it suggested in the film trailers that it was a quasi documentary. Shame on the studio for such deception! ""

Big thumbs down for the arogant pricks posing or calling themselves movie critics who dared to recommend this abomination.",1265587200,8,2509,4.2280334728033475
3981734,4,B002SJIO5O,"I recall film critic Andrew Sarris giving a lecture about the revolutionary nature of ""Night of the Living Dead,"" produced for mere thousands with amateur actors and a single ""premise"" rather than a plot.  More importantly, it started out, practically from the first frame, with terrifying shots, scaring the wits out of spectators, and seemingly going from one higher climax to another with no ultimate climax in sight.

But excise the ""action"" scenes from ""Living Dead,"" and all that's left is a lot of dead time and empty space, with nothing of consequence happening on the screen or in the viewer's mind. But not to worry. The sequels reduced the down time, with Romero taking the premise to ridiculous extremes, providing non-stop violent action from the very first frame and with little if any let-up. Then came the ""Evil Dead"" series of Bruce Campbell-Sam Raimi, which somehow managed to go even further with the continuum of violence and suspense, so much so that, like the later ""Living Dead"" films, the so-called suspense becomes so outrageous that the line between horror and humor is frequently blurred if not obliterated.  But such campiness is apparently the last thing some fans of ""District 9"" want to hear.  Even ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" a political thriller if there ever was one, would no doubt be preferred by those who see ""District 9"" as remarkably sui generis, non-intertextual, beyond comparison. There is no shortage of formulaic movies that ""District 9"" can be compared with, though one has to agree that ""Psycho"" or ""Vertigo"" isn't one of them.  The transformations of Norman and of Madeleine amount to highly disturbing moments of self-descovery to the spectator who has identified with either character, so totally that the experience is unshakeable yet unavoidable: without their metamorphoses into the hidden ""other"" persona of each, the movies and their spectators would both be incomplete.

A second viewing reinforces the conclusion that  Bomkamp deserves to be applauded for producing one of the fine films of the past 5-6 years.  He's a daredevil, a movie lover, and apparently a thinker.  Yet if risk deserves any awards, ""There Will Be Blood"" is the sort of film one doesn't expect to see produced any more.  There will always be audiences of all ages for ""District 9""'s, but you could never say the same for Hitchcock's ""Vertigo,"" Altman's ""Nashville,"" and Anderson's epic film of national self-scrutiny.  They demand analysis and interpretation; ""District 9"" plays O.K. without it.

What intrigues about the film is its ability to hold the audience' attention.  How can a roller-coaster thrill-ride be constantly engaging without pacing, without the moment of anticipation as the cart rises pending its precipitous free fall and screams?  In this film suspense and horror are largely subordinate to violence, action, revulsion (much of it reminding me of the popular medical ""freak shows"" on cable TV), and confusion (the contending parties at times become almost too many for the viewer to keep track of--which works to keep the viewer slightly off balance, as if in a tense, vertiginous state).  To suggest, as some reviewers have, that all of the engrossing action has an intricate or even broad allegorical meaning that will be apparent to the majority of viewers is merely to invite incredulity among those of us who do not find such science fiction spectacles to be all that profound, mind-altering, or even provocative.  (Kubrick invited interpretation--in fact, required serious reflection of the viewer of ""2001: Space Odyssey"" for the film to accumulate the power of serious literature.  David Lynch accomplished the improbable: making us love as a brother a fellow specimen who, alongside an elephant, is by far the greater alien; and in ""Blue Velvet"" he constructs a narrative positioning the viewer to choose between judging what he's seen as pornography or as an exceptionally graphic, modern version of ""Young Goodman Brown.""  The viewers I can find who have seen ""District 9,"" on the other hand, seem to remember little about the film in particular but recommend it in general as ""wild,"" ""over-the-top"" entertainment and inventive, resourceful film-making--which still places it short of significant art or, for that matter, fascinating storytelling let alone in-depth character study.

The film is capable of holding the spectator's interest thanks to the rapid editing, mix of film stock, shaky hand-held camera shots, and construction of the prawn-like, insect-like aliens.  Like the ""Living Dead"" films and the cold war thrillers (from ""Body Snatchers,"" ""Manchurian Candidate,"" etc.) the potential for political allegory is there but, even less than the Romero films' portrayal of the paranoia incited in the conservative establishment by the flower-child revolt of the '60s--later revealed as a new ""consumer power""), it fails to deliver on this promise.  80% of the film's dialogue is made up of a single 4-letter word, which is not sufficient to give the spectator a picture of an intolerant or totalitarian state.  To the viewer who makes the effort, the film brings out the degree to which, even as we put forth the appearance of humanitarianism and equal rights, we alienate ourselves through greed, self-interest, and a narrow, selfish pride.  The result is that we eventually become aliens ourselves, as the film's last shot so memorably discloses, allowing us room to interpret which of two creatures is the greater alien.

Creditably, even in Wikus' transformation into the apparent alien, we sense some room for sympathy for this creature of metal, steel, and electronic circuitry.  And unlike so many of his cousins in other sci-fi dystopias, he has not been victimized by technology.  Nor is the film's antagonist the evil state, bureaucracy, dictatorship, or governing institutions: it's rather the sin of Adam, as old as the very first texts and no less ""original.""  Just as ""District 9""'s protagonist becomes alienated from his garden, he, unlike Kafka's diminished and vitiated insect hero, retains the power to make his own garden.  Moreover, he has been given reason to ""believe""--the source being not some ""other"" creature but his own ""sweetie"" son--with a promise of deliverance in 3 years' time.

Anyway, it's definitely not the pure visual candy that Avatar was, but the story is much, much better.  The characters are very intriguing and complex, and the cinematography is quite creative with wicked action scenes and special effects that deserve a respectful salute.

I compare it to Avatar because it follows a similar theme: the humans, not the aliens, are the oppressors.  District 9 did it first, and, I must say, better--instead of paying lip service to every clich in the book, it threw them on the floor and stomped on them thoroughly.  The main character (note I didn't say hero because he's far from it), Wikus van der Mewe, is one of the most human and believable characters I've ever seen in a film (which is, if you watch the movie, incredibly ironic). I felt genuine sympathy for the prawns (the aliens), and actually liked them a lot more than most of the humans, despite their chitinous, buggy exterior.

Unlike Avatar, District 9 makes no effort to be pretty; in fact, I'd say it makes a point of showing the genuine ugliness of the situation.  I also liked how the story was told: the film starts out as if it were a documentary, using interviews and news clips, then shifts slowly into more traditional storytelling so seamlessly that the whole thing feels real.  Combine that with the aforementioned believable characters and in-your-face, nitty-gritty visuals, and you get a movie that is both incredibly epic and insanely close to reality.

As much as I love it, it's not for everyone.  District 9 is not a feel-good, escapist adventure, and some scenes are honestly brutal and gut-wrenching.  In my opinion, the freakin' sweet fight scenes (pig-throwing for the win) and the adorable baby prawn (ZOMG SO CUTE) make up for that, but it might not cut it for you.  Rent it first--you won't know for sure until you watch it.

3981743,4,B002SJIO5O,"As ""District 9"" opens, we learn that a mysterious spaceship has been hovering over Johannesburg, South Africa since 1982.  After years of trying unsuccessfully to integrate the more than a million aliens who arrived on it into regular society, government officials have decided to move them out of the slum, known as District 9, where they now reside, to District 10, a camp located far away from the city (the creatures are derisively referred to as ""Prawns,"" due to their crustacean-like appearance).  Trouble begins when Wikus Van De Merwe, a field operator for the MNU (Multinational United), becomes exposed to a mysterious alien substance while in the process of evacuating the camp, a substance that causes him to slowly turn into a Prawn himself.  Immediately, the MNU wants to dissect him to better understand how to operate the aliens' weaponry (for some reason human DNA renders the weapons useless in human hands).  However, Wikus escapes and becomes a fugitive from justice, finally hooking up with an alien who may possibly be able to help him retrieve his full humanity.  (Though set in South Africa, the movie`s provenance is actually New Zealand).

Shot partly in the style of a you-are-there documentary and partly as a conventional third-person narrative, this relatively low-budget ($30 million) thriller, written by Neil Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell and directed by Blomkamp, is high on creativity, raw energy and imagination and low on sci-fi movie cliches (the overused fugitive-on-the-run scenario being one of the few concessions it makes in that regard).  ""District 9"" also provides more food-for-thought than the average big-budget movie in this genre.  Like ""Alien Nation,"" it uses the arrival of outer space visitors to weave a thought-provoking parable about such relevant social issues as prejudice, governmental and corporatist secrecy and propaganda, black market exploitation of the masses, and xenophobia.  The script also deviates from the standard formula by making the aliens neither pointy-headed super-intellectuals light years ahead of us in knowledge, nor unthinking villains bent on colonization and destruction, nor namby-pamby sentimentalists reaching out a hand of friendship from across the cosmos.  They are just worker drones who happened to get stranded on a strange planet, whose generally compassionate inhabitants invited them to stay on - albeit clearly as second-class citizens, as it turns out.  The movie also captures some of the poignancy of the 1986 version of ""The Fly,"" as piece by piece, Wikus loses the one thing that defines what he is - his humanity.  Yet, ironically it is in becoming less human - in being able to more fully identify with an ""other"" to the point of extraordinary self-sacrifice - that he becomes most human (a theme not unlike the one in ""Avatar,"" actually).

Even with all its impressive CGI effects and hardware, ""District 9"" would not be half the movie it is without the extraordinary performance of Sharlto Copley who, as Wikus, provides the human heartbeat the picture needs to be effective.  A somewhat bumbling, barely competent bureaucrat is not an obvious choice for an action movie hero, but Copley makes that very tricky transition seem utterly natural and seamless.  Wikus is a good-hearted man who's forced by circumstances to perform actions he wouldn't normally perform just to survive, yet he remains true to his moral code most of the way through.  It is he and he alone who lifts ""District 9"" to the level of compelling human drama.

Excellent special effects, exciting action sequences, some subtle social satire (particularly in the early stretches) and moments of surprising tenderness all combine to make ""District 9"" a one-of-a-kind moviegoing experience.",1265068800,2,3762,5.264214046822742

I for one think this movie was the best movie of 2009 BETTER than AVATAR! Avatar was a great movie but in no means was it James camrons best (Terminator 2) but it was a fun and emotional ride. The reason i think District 9 was a superior movie is because it was much deeper and dealt with current situations and themes the world without rubbing political views in your face, I know it can seem anti big corporation and military but in no way does it have that stereotypical over the top and cheesy warmonger feel to the villains like avatar did. The Characters had depth and instead o fitting into a stereotype they were extremely complex, for example wikus  he starts off as an MNU public relations agent, when he starts transforming he abandons MNU for an alien (prawn as there called in the movie)  named christopher Wikus helps the prawn find the liquid that started his transformation but his motive are selfish and when told it would take three years to fix his condition Wikus betrays Christopher. as the movie progresses Wikus starts to realize that these Aliens need help and that they are living souls so he puts aside his selfish objective and almost sacrifices his life to save Christopher. NOW THATS A CHARACTER! Ill admit I Love Avatar and i enjoyed watching it but the story has been done a million times and the characters are the clones to the characters in camrons Aliens. Strong independent woman CHECK, military man with a heart CHECK, greedy corporate @ss hole CHECK, Butch woman BIG CHECK..... the list goes on. im just saying Avatar left me feeling like i just watch a recycled movie with blue aliens instead of indians, while district 9 made me feel like i could breath in an ocean of bad movies.",1264982400,,1875,4.511764705882353

The film starts out in documentary style outlining the landing and how the government deals with the bizarre intrusion.

The special effects are pretty good.  The hovering spaceship was pretty impressive looking.  3.  Though the film takes a serious tone, it lightly mixes in some humor which you cant tell is intentional or not.

The story is truly fresh.  After so many alien invasion stories that made them invulnerable, to use an apartheid metaphor to describe how humans might truly interact with creatures from another world was both remarkable and sobering.  It felt totally plausible, which is unique in science fiction.  What an indictment of human nature and our species shameless history in treating each other.  Of course, we'd put aliens into the same category as Jews in Nazi Germany or black townships in apartheid South Africa.

The film is filled with astonishing performances, in particular Sharlto Copley as Wikus, the company toady who becomes infected with alien DNA.  He provides the realistic center of a standout cast, none of whom felt like they were acting.

The special effects are seamless.  You really believe you are seeing humans and aliens interact in real time.

3981752,1,B002SJIO5O,"This movie got 90% positive on rotten tomatoes.  This must be because the critics are mostly left-wing progressives (aka ultra liberals).  Okay, the aliens (metaphor for undocumented immigrants, I guess.) are here because their spaceship broke down or they ran out of gas (pretty dumb for advanced super smart space beings).  They act and live like sort of uneducated/criminal/primitive subhumans. BUT, they are smarter than humans, obviously, due to their advanced technology, and they are much faster and stronger (but they're easily intimidated and bullied by humans).  Then, also, they have weapons that are far more advanced than ours, BUT Chris the alien refuses to use them to protect himself or his alien brothers.  The contradictions are many and inexplicable.  What's the rest of the metaphor here?  That aliens in our own society should be treated fairly and humanely because even though they have strange eating habits and are criminals, they are really pacific geniuses with super human strength that just want to hold hands and sing about peace?  And, finally, the evil people in this movie are weapons manufacturers.  Ironically, their obsession is with the far more deadly weapons that the aliens brought with them.  The blacks in the movie (the Nigerian gangsters) are portrayed as Voodoo, barbaric exploiters of the poor defenseless, but super strong and super smart, aliens.",1264896000,25,1393,5.262443438914027

-----------------------------------
(Mildly spoilerish review below)
-----------------------------------
A grotty but gripping sci-fi tragedy that begins with a city-sized spaceship that becomes marooned over Johannesburg, South Africa and is found to contain over a million refugee aliens.  The South Africans, having plenty of experience with apartheid, quickly move the buglike aliens into a large shanty town called District Nine, where squalor and crime run rampant.  Twenty years later, tensions between the ""prawns"" (as the aliens are derogatorily called) and humans come to a head, and a decision is made to move them onto a reservation, far off in the African bush. The evictions are under the supervision of a bland, seemingly nervous bureaucrat with a thick (and charming) Afrikaans accent, the kind of fumpfering, nebbishy functionary that proliferate in the UN and various European NGOs... But behind this seemingly innocent facade, the man's true character is soon revealed, as he heartlessly carries out thousands of illegal evictions, all held at the point of a machine gun... with full air support. The development of this central character is what makes this film fascinating -- the layers of cruelty, pettiness and glimmers of humanity, which make for one of the more interesting performances in recent years. In no small part this success is due to the script, which, while flooded with gory, disturbing images, is also quite multi-layered and skillfully crafted.  Good, solid sci-fi, with an entirely plausible scenario for how the human race might meet with a less-than-overwhelming alien invasion.  Recommended!

3981757,5,B002SJIO5O,"When the film District 9 came out to theatres in August of 2009, I heard mixed reviews.  Many poeple liked while many others absolutely hated this film.  So I became curious.  I had to see this film to find out for myself how good this film was.  Once i bought the film, not only did I love this film, I personally have hailed this film as the best film of 2009 as well one of the most important films ever.  Director Neill Blomkamp has has really crafted a work of complete originality as well as from the heart.  Apart from the underlying theme of aparthied that takes place in the film, there is yet another theme more important that.  It is quite evident that the aliens are symbolic as the various tribes in this country who look ironically enough look at each other as aliens.  It is a country that has been divided into warring nations and interestingly enough< Blomkamp doesn't treat this work with the mainstreamed-Hollywoos approach...  However, Blomkamp takes his material and makes a living documentary out of this.....Not just shot with a documentary feel, but more so that its happening right now.  District 9 takes us on a fictitious but nevertheless all to real feeling journey seen through the eyes of one man....  the main character Wikus Van de Merwe is unwillingly throw on a journey where he realizes the horrific nature that exists in human biengs.  He becomes the ultimate outsider and soon forms an uncommon bond with an extra-terrestrial named Christopher Johnson.

The film's perspective is ingenious as it focuses on humans who fear something that is unknown to them.  Because we fear the unknown, we act with hostility and therefore, cloud ourselves in denial as we believe that our actions are out of good judgement.  Actor Sharlto Copely gives a defining performance as an ordinary man thrown in extraordinary measures against his will.  First time feature film director Blomkamp Shines and executes his vision well with imagination as well as real life accounts definately making District 9 a film for the ages.",1264809600,,2042,4.824712643678161

The movie is far from what the average SIFI fan expects. Unlike many movies of the SIFI genre this one is not based on some high tech futuristic journey into the next galaxy. The film bleeds of raw, in your face, realism. Viewers just don't expect an alien movie that takes place in the ""here and now"" and not in some distant future.

Awesome movie, its a bi polar mix of social commentary, action, drama, adventure, science fiction, etc.  Its a complete genre blender.

This is also one movie, where in my opinion, the special effects are directly on point.

I find that a lot of action movies today with huge SFX, such as  Transformers, hsve action scenes that move way too fast to keep sight on, and they kind of become just a big blur of noise and colors. But maybe thats just me.

It begins with a spaceship hovering over johannesburg, however when the movie ends the question still remains - why did they come! Anyway apart from that small niggling curiosity what can I say.... Exceptional. CGI is excellent, the main actor says F**k alot, and then theres the advanced alien weapons... yes advanced alien weapons, which eventually we get a taste of what they can do....all of them. And to top it off, advanced robotic body armor, with all the trimmings.

The movies storyline is basic enough, aliens arrive, we take them in as refugees, exploit them, one man gets infected and begins mutating and it then revolves around that.  I got the blu-ray version and I have to say it is well worth it. I gave this film a 5star rating as it has all of what I could ever want.... aliens - on earth, spaceships, advanced weapons, excellent CGI and most of all, in all probability.... a sequel !!

3981782,3,B002SJIO5O,"The cinematography in this film is confused - - it switches between movie and documentary style, at will.  It didn't make me feel like I was watching a documentary or a movie - but it also wasn't a well done combination, in between.  I was more frustrated and distracted by the film making, than the ethics, topics, and situations of this film.

The film had great ethical dilemmas, was a great political commentary, and profile of humanity, but I wasn't able to connect with any of the characters.  The human characters weren't very believable, especially the main character.  The doddering main character was in a position of power, but had no control over his trigger happy cohorts.  Perhaps this was commentary on our actual state of world affairs, when this was filmed, but it just lacked the punch or present context to make the character work.

The main character is a flaccid nerd with no ethic or depth.  His fate in the movie was to develop that, but his redeeming moments were powerless, and his character does not invoke any inspiration or self reflection, in the audience.  Those who are going to see the nuance in this character's purpose are the people who are already aware of the state of humanity, politics, etc.  The point that is made with this character is so subtle and powerless, it won't affect the people in society that need to be affected in this way.

You'll probably find yourself siding with the aliens, in the end, and realizing the entire film is an analogy for cases of cultural clashes and immigration, across the world.

Otherwise, one extra star (bringing it up to three) for being a pretty cool sci-fi flick, with some great, and realistic animation.",1264377600,6,1687,4.739726027397261

They decide to confine them into a concentration camp, trying to isolate them from the outer world. But the chosen territory is overcrowded and sordid suburb, where the violence, misery and hunger are everywhere.

As the time goes by, this alien community begins to share with this people their way of living and so these aliens become part  of this enormous sector of relegated A horrid environment in which the hopeless is the only certain. The growing tension and the pressure of the public opinion force the Government to find a relative solution: to displace this alien community 200 km. from the city.

Wikus van de Merwe is a sympathetic reporter who works out as the commander in chief of the process of dislodging, interviewing the displaced aliens. It's to say the information in plain development. But when he triggers the Pandora's box, the drama will begin for this Government functionary.

Nell Blomkamp makes not only an amusing plot with hints black humor, but besides he makes a demolishing critic about the struggling dehumanization, the scandalous process of contamination produced by technological residues and the primitive approach to deal with this curious problem all the way through.

Perhaps, the only flaw of the film is the last breadth of sentimentalism that exudes the last sequence of the film which clearly weakness seriously the plot.

In sum, more than a smart sci-fi (which pays a deserved homage to ""The fly"" and a collateral tribute to ""Transformers"") is an incisive statement about the unaltered human condition.

3981791,4,B002SJIO5O,"*****WARNING:  KEY PLOT POINTS REVEALED IN THIS REVIEW*************************

The great thing about the thoroughly original and entertaining sci-fi film District 9 is the way that it takes our preconceived notions of what ""alien"" films are and completely turns them upside down.  This is no mere story about humans fighting it out with a vicious race of creatures bent on world domintation.  No, District 9 is something different.

The movie focuses on a violent slum in Johannesburg, South Africa populated by aliens who arrived on earth 30 years ago.  In order to contain any diseases they migh be carrying, the government rounded the aliens up and forced them to live in an internment camp in order to keep them isolated from the citizens of the city.  Over time the camp has grown into a ramshackle community full of crime and poverty.

It is into this slum that the film's main character, Wikus (a remarkable Sharlto Copley) enters to serve eviction notices to the inhabitants who the government plans to begin moving to a larger, less accommodating place of residence.  Things take a turn for the worse when he comes into contact with an alien substance which causes him to begin transforming into an alien himself.

The bulk of the film follows Copley's character as he goes from an insensitive, spineless buerocrat to an alien sympathizer who ends up fighting against his own government which is trying to harvest his alien body parts in an attempt to operate the creatures' weapons.  It is amazing to watch Copley as his character transforms from a cowardly self-opportunist to an angry, resourceful fugitive who does what he has to in order to survie and finally into a friend and ally of the misunderstood and mistreated aliens.

There are parallels drawn to apartheid, segregation and even the AIDS epidemic that put this film a cut above most other summer action flicks.  In the end though, District 9 is at its heart, an adrenaline filled, edge of your seat thirll ride.  The fact that it is also smart and surprising is just icing on the cake.",1264032000,14,2061,4.868194842406877

Remember the early scifi film where the astronaut comes home with an alien fungus on his arm which eventually envelops his entire body! Or THE FLY, where the man has a giant fly head! This movie, DISTRICT 9, borrows from lots of those films; but it borrows in a good way and an original way. And DISTRICT 9 is filmed in such a different way that it really does not remind us of any other film. The story has many problems, and requires huge leaps of faith to remain cohesive. But if we go along it is worth it. For me, just watching the aliens move is worth it. The alien design and the motion capture is astounding.",1263945600,5,773,4.125827814569536

Problems with the script:
1. The movie never explains how a clearly superior race of beings ""stalled out"" hovering over the Earth and almost starved themselves to death, luckily this is not important to the plot.
2. More importantly, the fact that the alien visitors clearly understand their resulting mistreatment on this planet and do nothing to change it even though they are in possession of weapon technology far superior than ours.

Other than the 2 items mentioned above, it's actually pretty good.
The special effects are mind-blowing, the viewer literally can't tell the difference between a real actor and a CG alien standing right next to each other.  A+ on this one!

3981799,5,B002SJIO5O,"I think a comparison to Star Trek XI, which appeared in the movie theaters about the same time as this movie, makes the difference between quality sci-fi and pulp sci-fi.

Star Trek XI has a rich wrap of color, effects, pretty actors & half nude actresses, and speed which cover a plotless action movie. It does nothing but entertain the viewer for the duration of the movie.

District 9 is good sci-fi. It takes creates a fictional situation, one that would have been possible only with the aid of science humanity does not have, as a tool to make the viewer think about issues that would be hard to make him think as clearly in other ways.

One such issue is how humans treat other humans. As one character says in the beginning of the movie: an alien ship came, and people expected music from heaven and bright shining lights (Close Encouters of the Third Kind ?) to be followed by humanity taking a great step forward (2001: A Space Oddysey ?).

Disappointingly, humanity stays it's old self. It treats the aliens same as it treated it's own kind, trying to trick it out of what it has for wealth and power. Appropriately, the prawns don't treat humans any better, and Christopher Johnson's first priority is to get help for his son & his people, Wikus taking a lower priority - and why shouldn't he ?

Which raises the question - if humanity develops spaceships, would we get any better ? Upon finding an alien race on another planet, would it be any different from what Europeans did with their ships when they landed on the costs of Africa or America ?",1263686400,4,1559,4.51418439716312

I was excited to see it just because it seemed like another Independance Day. So, I had no idea what to expect when it started. To summarize first, I was disappointed but still liked it enough to give 3 stars. The short version is a group of aliens come to the Earth and their mother ship gets stuck hanging above South Africa. This event happened many years ago and the aliens are now living in slum-like conditions in a prison camp. The style of this movie is to look like a news program or a documentary. Alot shot on video rather than film gives a crisp look. It seemed like a low budget film until you realize the high quality seamless special effects. So, I was not all that impressed with this movie and will give it a mildly positive recommendation.

3981803,1,B002SJIO5O,"This is a truly awful movie to watch. Although the premise behind it sounds interesting, once you start watching it, you really wish the humans and aliens would just kill each other off and be done with it so the movie would be over.

First, it's like watching a documentary. Next, the aliens act so stupid you have to wonder how they could possibly be intelligent enough to create such advanced technology. The aliens are pretty gross looking in my opinion, and as far as being sympathetic to them, it's rather hard because again, they come off as being stupid for allowing themselves to be treated as they are.

Ultimately this movie suffers from the ""B"" word: BORING. If you're having trouble sleeping though, I highly recommend it. It will definitely make you want to go to sleep just to avoid watching it.

Additional information:

When I wrote this review, I couldn't think of the right word to describe this so I used documentary. However, it's more like a reality show, or something you would see in real time.

Are reality shows edited? I really don't know because I don't watch them. I don't consider them to be interesting either.

If you like reality shows or shows shot in real time, you may very well like this movie. I don't know. What I do know for sure is that I didn't like it, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

As my mother always said, ""Different strokes for different folks."" Since all of the criticism about my review has come from supposedly adult, but immature males who still play with toys, I can only conclude that this movie was made for that class.",1263600000,21,1612,4.6749116607773855

3981808,4,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 arrived with little hype or advanced marketing but turned out to be the best action or sci-fi movie of Summer 2009. The story actually starts 20 years after the aliens have arrived in their dinged up ship. The alien ship hovers over Johannsburg, RSA while the aliens who piloted the ship are sick and malnourished. Fast forward 2 decades- their human hosts have lost interest in their plight, especially as humans are unable to exploit the aliens advanced weapons technology. This weaponry is actually linked to the alien DNA which of course we don't have. In a sign of hate and derision, the humans refer to the aliens as ""Prawns."" The aliens have become just another bothersome minority to the people of Jo burg. 'District 9' refers to the special urban (slum)zone they live in. It is in this context that the main character, Wikus van de werwe, a quiet unassuming bureaucrat, stumbles upon secrets of the alien technology, including the advanced weapons. The movie is filmed documentary style with great effect.

When I first heard of this movie I doubted that it was going to be good. The plot at first seemed vaguely reminiscent of the 80s goofball sci-fi movie 'Alien Nation.' I never could believe the premise- that Aliens advanced enough to build and pilot an interstellar ship thousands of light years to earth could then be pushed around so easily by human authorities. But this movie is nothing like that flawed and gimmicky movie- District 9 is creative, has a fresh script and great special effects. And the interaction between van Werwe and his Alien friend and young son seem genuine.

3981809,4,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is a landmark science fiction film that tells a story of incredible originality. On the surface is it about a man who is forced to grow close to an alien once he has been infected with their DNA and is running afoul of the authorities. It is also a parable for the South African apartheid that is so caustic to different races there- it's not coincidental that it is set in Johannesburg. Allusions are kept tucked away in the background, though, and what you get instead is great storytelling. The film moves like a freight train and is always inventive in its plotting and structure. It is aided by seamless CGI effects, populating the rusted shacks of the ghetto with agitated creatures that are as scared of man as they are willing to destroy them. Also of note is the film's very fine performances and screenplay. It takes a pretty special hand to make you grow empathetic to seven foot-tall lobsteresque things, but by the end of this one you'll be rooting for the alien dad's little guy. Here's hoping for a sequel.",1263340800,2,1032,4.583783783783784
3981810,4,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 was one of several big 'sleeper' hits in 2009. Made on a relatively modest budget of $30 million, it made more than six times its money back at the box office (a success that even the mighty Avatar has not yet quite replicated), despite featuring no star names and being made and set in South Africa with a large amount of subtitles. The movie's origins are also unusual. Director Neill Blomkamp had previously been hired by producer Peter Jackson to work on the Halo move adaptation after producing several imaginative short adverts for the Halo 3 promotional treadmill. Blomkamp and Jackson's work on the film was at a fairly advanced stage when the movie was put on hold due to concerns over its immense budget. Having enjoyed collaborating together, Jackson and Blomkamp decided to fill in the spare time with a new project, a (relatively) low-budget expansion of Blomkamp's earlier short film Alive in Joburg. Given the film's immense number of high-quality effects shots and the heavily action-driven last act, it is even more impressive that the movie was made for such a small amount of money (only a little more than 10% of the budget of Avatar, for example).

District 9 is a curious beast. Much of its opening half is filmed from the POV of various camera crews, news footage, documentaries and so on, introducing the aliens, their spaceship, MNU and Wikus himself. After the incident in the slums when Wikus is infected this approach is scaled back in favour of following the action in a more traditional manner. This transition is a little awkward (with Wikus asking someone to shut off a camera after a good 15-20 minutes of the story being completely told using the documentary approach and then the action continues to unfold) but aside from that this mix of approaches does work quite well. With Sharlto Copley as Wikus being on screen for pretty much the entire movie, his performance is key to making the movie work, and fortunately he is an excellent actor. He improvised most of his dialogue to keep the film feeling authentic and real despite its SF premise, and he is aided by some great prosthetic and make-up work. Jason Cope takes on the role of 'Christopher', an alien plotting to escape Earth who becomes Wikus' only ally as the story proceeds, and like Andy Serkis in The Lord of the Rings trilogy performed his role in-camera only to be replaced by CGI later on. Cope does a fantastic job, giving Christopher (clearly some kind of technician or higher-caste creature than the other, rather unintelligent aliens) real character and presence.

Broadly, District 9 is a successful and 'different' SF movie, with a clear parallel being drawn between the treatment of the aliens by humans (black and white alike) and the treatment of the black population of South Africa during apartheid. The movie's title and premise are based on the 'District Six' situation of the 1970s, when an area of Johannesburg was declared 'whites only' and the black population was forcibly moved to another location. The South African setting gives rise to a very different SF movie to what you may have expected in an American or European film. Violence is commonplace, the killing of aliens by MNU personnel or humans by the aliens is largely unremarked on (shrugged off as one of the dangers of the job) and corruption of the MNU and the law enforcement company they have hired is endemic. This bleakness is present throughout the film, and although occasionally wearying, does make the film feel authentic. The fact that the aliens have been around for twenty years and no-one is really shocked by them any more also gives the film an interesting air of realism in spite of is highly fantastical premise.

The CGI is excellent throughout. Not quite as breathtaking as Avatar, obviously, but the constant integration of the CG aliens with real human actors in real locations is clearly challenging and they pull it off pretty much flawlessly. It's so good, in fact, that you forget that these creatures, weapons and in a couple of cases weapons are not actually there at all, which is of course the point of good visual effects, supporting the story without diverting attention away from it.

One flaw I've seen noted by critics is that the movie's intelligent side, notably the exploration of the apartheid-like relationship between the aliens and humans and possible further exploration of the aliens' backstory, is largely abandoned in the third act in favour of an extended running action sequence. I didn't have a huge problem with this, as Blomkamp was clearly uninterested in making a vast epic and wanted to get in, say some interesting things, deliver an entertaining picture, and then get out again, which is fairly laudable in an age of needlessly swollen running times. Whilst there's some logic problems in the final act (the alien mecha suit that plays a large role in the climax seems to go from being invulnerable, heavily-armoured and sporting powerful weapons to being fairly fragile and unable to take down a small number of opponents in the space of a couple of scenes) it's also fairly compelling, with some great moments building up to a somewhat ambiguous ending. The movie is left open-ended for a possible sequel or follow-up, but the movie as it stands has enough closure to be satisfying.

District 9 (****) is a short, sharp and clever motion picture combining great visuals and some interesting thematic elements with excellent performances. The film is available now on DVD (UK, USA) and Blu-Ray (UK, USA).",1263340800,2,5554,4.89171974522293

This is a film (with artistic pretentions) masquerading as a action movie.
As a film? It rocks!
As a movie? I enjoyed it, but it ain't ""Alien's"".
It's got too many real world elements that make it less a fantasy then a glimpse at an alternative reality.  It does not pander to it's audience, which is where I think a lot of the angy review are coming from. This is a slow moving, totally engrossing story that builds, and builds and builds. Even when you figure out where it's going, it does not take the EZ way out.
It's ""action"" is the brutal world that the aliens live in (and military rule they live under).  You'd have to be a sociopath to enjoy watching this type of stuff for ""fun"".
I thought the lead actor was wonderful, as was his character flaws.  He slowly reveals the layers of complexity to his nature, and it's very confusing and wonderful.
You keep wondering who is the hero, the victim, etc.
I disagree with reviews that think the message is that all Military Forces are brutes or that all big business is evil.
The world is filled with heros and villians.  Sometimes they defend the flag, other times they hide behind it.
What is far more interesting here is the idea of just what it takes for something to be alien enough for we humans to turn off our humanity and decide that it's okay to mistreat and destroy another race.  Yes, it's not an accident that this takes place in South Africa and it only  the film that much more stunning.  Like the ""Twilight Zone"" decades earlier, the film uses Sci Fiction to make a larger point.

3981815,5,B002SJIO5O,"So many science fiction stories are about aliens attacking, subjugating, or exploiting humans.  In District 9, the shoe is on the other foot.

One day, a gigantic space ship comes to a stop over Johannesburg, South Africa.  After a few months with no other movement and no communication, the ship is opened, only to discover over a million aliens living in squalor.  These aliens (eventually called, derogatorily, ""prawns""), cannot explain how they came to be there, or how to operate the ship.  They are settled in Johannesburg and, after 20 years, the settlement is a massive slum.  The movie begins with the initiation of a massive resettlement process to move the aliens to a new ""settlement"" (a guarded camp away from Johannesburg and its people).

To abide by international laws affecting refugees, a mid-level bureaucrat (Wikus) is assigned the task of getting the aliens to sign a release authorizing their relocation.  The interaction between Wikus and the aliens is comical and horrific at the same time.  But when Wikus is accidently sprayed with a strange ""fluid,"" his life, and his relationship with the aliens, changes radically.

The cinematography in District 9 starts off in a herky-jerky fashion, and the viewer gets pulled into an intense story just as the cinematography, and the plot, gets more complicated and coordinated.  At the end, I suspect 99% of all viewers yelled or thought, ""What happens NEXT!""  We will never know, but it's a great topic to bring up with friends in a cafe.

I've seen this movie twice, and I wish I would have watched it on the big screen.  I really see it as becoming a classic sci-fi flick, pushing the boundaries of what is typical - humans being noble and aliens being ethically challenged usurpers.

Not this time.

Unique weapons, a novel language, the matter-of-fact way of killing alien babies, Nigerian scammers, the power of money, the power of love, the status and treatment of refugees, ... these are all introduced in this film.

3981820,5,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is easily my favorite film of 2009 and one of the best films I've ever seen. It takes an almost forgotten theme of using science fiction to explore social issues as well as deliver invigorating entertainment. It's in-your-face in it's approach but never once did I think this film was preaching. It lets the story, action and characters tell a tale without trying to shove anything down your throat.

The basic plot (as you know already) is about an alien ship arriving in South Africa and the social/political/military back-lash becuase of it. The story at first unfolds in a documentary style using mockumentary footage. This would've made a facinating story enough, but the movie takes it several steps farther and starts to slowly move behind the scenes to show the more humane story behind all the mock-interviews and news footage. I won't go into more detail but what unravels from this setup is an exciting sci-fi thriller packed with knock-out acting (particulary by lead Sharlto Copley), excellent special effects (with wonderful creature animations), and exciting action scenes.

While I'd be satisfied with just the movie alone (and it looks suprisingly good on small-screen DVD), the single disc DVD actually comes with a three-part indepth look at the makings of District 9. It's probably not as involved as the double-disc or blu-ray editions but it's more than I'd expect from a single disc release.

He also tells a powerful story about what it means to be an outsider in one's own country. The aliens have been on Earth for twenty years and they have been segregated into a slum on the outskirts of Johannesburg called District 9. The government wants to reclaim the District and move the aliens to a relocation camp. To do this they employ MNU a sort of private army organization/corporation. The story follows the actions of one of the corporate bureaucrats Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) as he attempts to evict the aliens from there homes only to be infected by a liquid that turns him into an alien.

Much will be said about the well done integration of the CGI aliens into the film but there is a human and moral story that goes beyond the action. The film was based on Blomkamp's short Alive In Joburg which I would be very interested in seeing were it to become available. The single standard efinition DVD that I viewed contained a very good transfer of the film, an excelent commentary by Blomkamp, a large number of deleted scenes and a three part making of documentary.

This is one of those films that you may not have seen on its initial release but is well worth checking out on DVD.",1263081600,3,1597,4.538194444444445

3981824,5,B002SJIO5O,"Neill Blomkamp's ambition to do something different with the timehonored alien contact theme made ""District 9"" the best science fiction film of the decade. He wanted to make a movie in which aliens visit the developing world instead of a First World metropolis. And he wanted the aliens to be neither conquerors nor enlightened idealists come to set humans on the right path. Blomkamp grew up in South Africa, so he chose Johannesburg. He lived there during the Apartheid years, so he placed the action in Soweto and, with co-writer Teri Tatchell, constructed a plot inspired by the civil unrest that inevitably occurs when the upwardly mobile segments of society must face the violence and destitution that plagues the populations of their slums, townships, favellos, shantytowns, refugee camps, etc. and spills over into middle class lives.

Twenty years ago, a spacecraft came to rest over Johannesburg. When months pass with no action, humans force their way inside. What they find is horrific: A million aliens starving, aimless, and apparently unable to operate the craft. The aliens are evacuated to a holding camp, District 9, where they are fed, but it is not clear what should be done with them. Nicknamed ""Prawns"" due to their crustacean-like appearance, the aliens seem to require leaders in order to function, like an insect colony, and their leadership perished in whatever catastrophe befell the spaceship. Now they are violent, disorganized, and a menace to society. It is determined that the aliens cannot integrate with humans. Their ship won't work, so they can't leave. The private military Multi-National United (MNU) that has been hired to contain the aliens now has the job of evicting them from District 9 to a camp farther removed from the human population.

The man in charge of the operation is Wikus van de Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a bureaucrat of little talent who owes his career to his domineering father-in-law, MNU's CEO. As we might expect, the removal of the aliens does not go off without a hitch. It turns out to be an especially big hitch for Wikus van der Merwe. Like all good science fiction, ""District 9"" is allegory. We might think we recognize the theme right away, but it turns out not to be as simple or clichd as it first appeared. That's what makes ""District 9"" a great movie. Many a Third World Marxist have made films about populations who live on the fringes of society in destitution, unable to put themselves on the road to prosperity, so instead fall victim to cycles of violence. Those films are simplistic to the point of disingenuous. They don't intend to make people think, but simply to scold the bourgeoisie. They're unwatchable.

""District 9"" is an action movie. It has a lot of sheer entertainment value. That helps. But where it departs from the standard impoverished immigrant population versus middle class xenophobia paradigm is daring: Neill Blomkamp dares to make everyone unlikable. In forcing the audience to sympathize with the characters' situation, not with the characters themselves, ""District 9"" turns the tables, not just on conventions of filmmaking, but on moral laziness.

Wikus van de Merwe is not an Everyman that Harrison Ford or Bruce Willis would play, a man who looks ordinary but takes on superhuman resilience and lofty ideals when faced with adversity. They are what the audience likes to imagine themselves to be. Wikus is a sniveling bureaucrat. He's a nice enough guy. But he's selfish. He couldn't care less about the ethics of his job, as long as he collects a paycheck and goes home to the wife he adores. He's a real Everyman. He's not what the audience wants to be; he's what the audience is. He's not admirable, but he is so real that everyone can understand how he must feel. And everyone can understand that he shouldn't be treated the way he is, even though Wikus would (and does) turn a blind eye to that kind of treatment if someone else were on the receiving end.

The Prawns are victims of countless human and civil rights violations. But the human populace has genuine reason to fear them. Whatever they might have been when they had leadership, without it they run riot. They steal; they kill; they don't like humans. They cannot be blamed for disliking humans, but neither could they realistically be integrated into human society. They're not sympathetic. They appear no better than their human oppressors, maybe worse. The alien called ""Christopher"" has some qualities that we might admire, but the Prawns generally do not. But we can sympathize with their situation, all while disliking them. They're very far from their own culture, without the means they need to function productively, and they are being treated like vermin. ""District 9"" doesn't let the audience off the hook for thinking that we can throw the concept of rights out the window because we fear someone, no matter how justified that fear may be.

Maybe I am alone in this, but I am disturbed by the facile morality-by-emotional-response that I see so often. Writers and filmmakers have the idea that the way to make people examine the ethics of a situation or to understand another point of view is to make the ""other"" population like ourselves. If we can see ourselves in them, then they must be worthy of ethical treatment, or their point of view may be worthy of consideration. Films are certainly successful in employing this technique, and people do have a natural ""like me"" or ""unlike me"" reaction when confronted with something new, but that doesn't mean it is an acceptable standard for behavior. If people can't figure out how to act ethically when faced with someone they don't like or can't understand, we have a serious problem. That's not rational or moral behavior; it's self-indulgence. ""District 9"" doesn't take the easy way out. It gets the audience to come down on the side of ethics when faced with a muddy situation and a dangerous and incomprehensible enemy.

""District 9"" presents itself in the style of a documentary made after the events take place. It departs from documentary mode into a more cinematic style for action that the documentary crew obviously wouldn't see. But a lot of the film is handheld, so if a shaky camera makes you nauseated, you will need Dramamine. I did not find ""District 9"" to be as shaky as ""The Bourne Supremacy"" or any number of low-budget ""independent"" films. At least there is a reason for the shakiness, as the documentary crew is tromping around the slums. I also liked the fact that the violent action seemed plausible (not considering the alien technology), as it is not unheard of for military or heavily armed police to enter slums, nor for the residents to be heavily armed. It's a welcome respite from trucks and airplanes engaged in high speed chases on the freeway or downtown office buildings exploding with pretty fireballs perfectly synchronized to the score.

The DVD (Sony 2009 single disc): Bonus features are 22 deleted scenes, one featurette, and an audio commentary. ""The Alien Agenda: A Filmmaker's Log"" (33 min) has 3 chapters, one about pre-production and the concept that became ""District 9"" (7  min), the second about shooting the film (16 min), and the third about post-production, including sound design and editing (9 min). Director Neill Blomkamp, producer Peter Jackson, co-writer Teri Tatchell, the creative crew, and cast are interviewed. Neill Blomkamp's audio commentary is constant and addresses the sociopolitical themes and how they relate to South Africa.

I'm not a critic, not by a long shot, so I will say that this is one of my favourite films of all time. I loved the story portrayed, first and foremost, and the gritty 'reality' behind human nature as seen in D9. The character development, while not exceedingly extensive, was more in depth and realistic than a lot of other films I had seen in the past (ie, Avatar). Loved the acting, especially on Copley's part. CGI was impressive for such a low budget film, definitely better than one would see on the SyFy channel. Oh, and no bikini clad women running from the blood thirsty monster, or any sexual content for that matter; the film gained instant respect from me by this aspect.

Maybe the reason I love D9 so much is because it inspired my writing, which would put my love for D9 in a personal light rather than from a critic's view. Said I was no critic though, eh?

3981835,3,B002SJIO5O,"Hey, this may not rival the mega block buster epic sagas of science fiction that have millions to spend on production, but it actually was done pretty well and the underdog wins. I don't know about you but I've just about had enough of cliff hangers or giant efforts to make evil industructable to the point of getting numb as a viewer not knowing what to believe. This movie (D9) ignores the stereo typical ideas for sci-fi and gives me a sense of hope that no matter what sometimes the right champion emerges against all odds. On one hand it is shameful the producer drops the name 'Lord of the Rings' as part of his work, because D9 isn't even in the same league by any definition - not anywhere even close. But it is great to see some body count happening where it should and for what little budget there was obviously used (not used), I'd still recommend this movie for die-hard sci-fi fans. Not because it is fantastic, but because crawfish prawns deserve to be heard. The unlikely alliance formed is laughable but still a great idea to base the story's plot upon nonetheless. The armored suit machine had my attention, and I couldn't help but realize I need one of those myself in real life for about a week or two (hee hee hee hee). Don't spend big bucks on this movie - get it used, single disc edition, and that way you can still enjoy it. I'm grateful Amazon dot com has those kind of options and such a variety of reviews.

3981837,5,B002SJIO5O,"What if a sick alien race came to Earth for help? Would we give them aid, only to fence them in slums and ghettos because of fear? This scenario occurs in District 9, an incredible, in your face science fiction movie that was released this past August and became a huge hit. The well known director, Peter Jackson produced this film and it is a profound, yet disturbing very psychological tale. The disturbing aspect deals with the fact that because of the fear of the unknown, a group of outsiders who look different, act and speak so strangely are treated worst then animals by human beings, who are supposed to be humane and treat living things with respect. District 9 brings all the horrors of racism and bigotry front and center. This style of film making and the lessons learned are not new, but afterwards you are left with a sense of sadness and shock.

District 9 is filmed much like a documentary. We come to understand through onscreen interviews and television footage that twenty years ago an alien ship came to hover over Johannesburg, South Africa. For three months there was no contact until humans cut into the ship. They discovered over 1 million aliens sick and dying. These aliens were treated and cared for, up to a point. Soon after the aliens, which were given the derogatory label of being called Prawns, because of the sea creature they resemble, are housed in government camps. Over the next two decades, due to overcrowding and poor conditions, this has become a slum known as District 9. There is a black market set up between the aliens and a warlord who rules without any fear, as well as inter-species prostitution and the buying and selling of alien weapons that only the aliens can operate due to their DNA.

Now twenty years later these Prawns will be moved because the human community that surrounds District 9 hates them. The Multi-National United (MNU) is a private group that has been contracted to move the close to 2 millions aliens to the District 10 camp that is further away from Johannesburg where the aliens will now live in tents. The only reason MNU is involved because they want to figure out a way to use the alien's advance weapons for the benefit of the human race.

MNU thinks the Prawns are slow witted and dumb and will do whatever they are told. A field operative, Wilkus van der Merwe, is given the task of moving the Prawns, mainly because his father-in-law is a higher up in MNU. Wilkus thinks this will be pretty easy because he's protected by a special task force who will shoot and kill the Prawns if need be. Wilkus has no clue what's happening behind the scenes, especially with a specific Prawn, Christopher and his son, who have found a way to power up the mother ship and return to their home plane to find reinforcements and bring help to his people who have been enslaved. Unfortunately for Christopher, Wilkus finds the alien device with this special fuel Christopher has been collecting over the past twenty years. Because Wilkus is a bit of a bumbling fool, the fuel spurts in his face. From that moment on Wilkus is now a target of MNU because the liquid has allowed his human DNA to mesh with his new alien DNA. He is slowly changing into a Prawn and Christopher is his last resort in keeping him human.

Had I watched this before 2009 ended, I would've said that District 9 is one of the most powerful movies I've watched that year. This is a gritty, dark, gruesome and bloody tale that left me hollow. The humans in this movie are shown as cruel, money hungry individuals who treat the Prawns much like the Nazi's treated the Jewish community and anyone different from the pure German white race during WWII. You can also see the strong comparisons to racial segregation because of the history of apartheid in South Africa.

I couldn't sympathize with Wilkus at all because he is just as biased against the Prawns much like his human counterparts. Until he walks in the Prawns' footsteps and is on his way to becoming one, is when he comes to some conclusions. But even when he understands the way the Prawns have been treated is horrendous, he still has this underlying belief because he is human, he's superior. Only when he suffers, does he begin to change his opinions.

District 9 is not some mindless fluffy sci-fi movie with only guns blazing and warfare. Even though body parts and heads are blown off, this is justified because of the warlike battles the humans and the Prawns engage in. The effects are amazing and the Prawns look so very real. One of the most telling things as I watched was that the humans come across as very one-dimensional, even in the case of Wilkus whose only salvation is the love he has for his wife. He wants to become human again to be with her. Christopher the Prawn and his young son have wonderful personalities and we see the interesting father and son relationship between the two as well as their will to survive. The Prawns have very big eyes and through them we can see every emotion and feeling.

District 9 is powerful, raw and uncomfortable. But, this movie can teach so much in regards to the universal message about the need to be more accepting and understanding. After the movie ends, you don't feel uplifted but quite the opposite and come to the profound conclusion that being different should be embraced. You never know, because that day could come when you are on the opposite side of the fence and treated without the common respect and courtesy we are all entitled to.

3981838,5,B002SJIO5O,"I'm actually shocked to see the negative reviews for this film, as if people either are not sci-fi lovers, do not appreciate a very different kind of alien film and simply expected the usual extraterrestrial flick that has the same kind of plot with alike ending.

Hats off to the writers that came up with the story line, making it a unique alien movie. It does not take place in New York or in outter space or in a different planet and how the movie develops will grasp your attention even more. What started off as one thing takes a complete turn around and the fun begins from there. What also separates this film from others with the same content is that us humans are the real bad guys, but it doesn't tell you that right away. It will reflect in many ways our true side of how hungry us humans are for science and technology growth and how we will do anything to get to that destiny. You will actually feel sympathy for the 'prawns' through out the movie.

As for the cast, I was very pleased with Sharlto Copley's performance. This man should get at least a nomination for his portrayal of Wikus, the main character.

No complaints for the special effects either. Even though this was not a high budget film it was very well made and achieved.

I recommend this movie to anyone, even if they're not into sci-fi. Definitley one of the best movies of 2009",1262736000,4,1361,4.410358565737051
3981839,5,B002SJIO5O,"It sounds simplistic, but really, in a situation that was so set up, the movie did spectacularly in focusing on the main plotline while keeping the background story adequately explained without overwhelming the main story. Never is there a point where Wikus Van Der Merwe and someone else bring the movie to a grinding halt with expository narrative like ""You know, 20 years ago when this first started...""

The trailers gave us what appeared to be a faux-documentary style, involving a modern-day Apartheid... with aliens. That alone would get my butt in a theater seat.

Holy hell. In a time period where unique and genuinely great and entertaining movies are a scarcity, this one is a welcome blessing. I hate to do this, but I feel forced to; ""Avatar"", nearly $300 million dollars to make has some of the best and most realistic CGI ever. And it has a story a 4th grader would find lame and stupid. It's story is not unique, not good, not interesting, full of stale cliche's, total lack of surprises, and a tiresome Human-bashing with a glorification of Na'vi culture that is a near perfect mirror for Native American societies before we extinguished them as the evil creatures we were.

This movie, meanwhile, is wholly unique, as much as it can be in a day and age where the audience has seen pretty much everything.

The setup is right there: Aliens come to Earth as refugees, and rather than go to the stereotypical places of New York or London or Los Angeles, they end up in... Johannesburg, South Africa. After the initial awe of first contact fades, these aliens are now universally hated among the entire local populace.

The story is right in front of it: Wikus Van Der Merwe, set up as a doofy, bright-eyed, largely average and sheepish worker for MNU, the company tasked with caring for these aliens (who are revealed to not be very bright, and thought to be proverbial ""worker ants"" of a hive-mind society, or else the slaves/lower classes). The movie begins with a documentary which right away foreshadows exactly what will happen, in a brilliant way that neither draws suspicion nor gives anything away.

Wikus seems inexplicably villainized by some of the documentary people for reasons you assume to be due to him being MNU, or being stupid, or making enemies or such. Turns out, he's married the daughter of MNU's boss, and thus cries of NEPOTISM can be raised when he's put in charge of a vast eviction of the alien inhabitants of District 9.

The eviction scenes are where the movie's only humor comes, easy and naturally, as Wikus and a co-worker, and a genial, fat MNU soldier go hut to hut trying to get the aliens (called ""Prawns"") to sign them. Rather than show us every single one, they separate some of them with convenient and brilliantly paced and placed bits of exposition, with documentary-style narrative of how the Prawns have existed, how they're treated over the years, how they've committed acts of violence, and how District 9 has attracted gangsters, primarily Nigerian, and how they exploit the Prawn's love of cat food by selling them the stuff in exchange for alien weapons and technology, though this technology is somehow bioengineered to work only for the Prawns.

By the time the end of the eviction scenes comes, you're filled in with huge amounts of information, most from these asides, some from Wikus explaining things to his co-worker buddy. The chemistry Sharlto has with the two of them is shockingly good, considering he's never acted before, save for a few seconds in Neil Blomkamp's short film ""Alive in Joburg"", which District 9 is actually based upon. His natural charm and humor is a welcome relief from even atrocities such as a Prawn ripping off a soldier's arm, then being shot to death, or a hut full of Prawn eggs being exterminated with a flamethrower, while Wikus jokes that their deaths sound like popcorn popping.

From there, the movie plot focuses on the next main character, a Prawn given the name ""Christopher Johnson"", who has a son. It's in CJ's hut that Wikus is exposed to the alien substance that causes him to slowly change into them. This isn't a spoiler, since the trailers for the DVD gave this away.

The rest of the movie becomes part action film, part survival, as Wikus is taken in by MNU, subjected to experiments (including weapons testing, as it's found that the alien arm he's grown is capable of using the alien weapons), and the decision is made to vivisect him to study his body and DNA before the transformation makes him fully Prawn.

Everything in this film is wonderfully acted, and meticulously written. Nothing is a red herring---not the documentary segments showing some of the Nigerians believing eating alien parts will cure diseases like STDs and Alzheimer's, nor the Prawn selling a mech-walker machine for cat food, nor the seemingly unimportant bit of documentary footage showing a ""piece"" of the spaceship falling out of it 20 years ago when it first arrived. All of those aspects play a vital part in forwarding the plot.

Probably one of the best things about the film is that it doesn't give us a trite, stale, and boring bit of character ""development"" or sudden shocking change or try to make Wikus perfect for the audience's sensibilities (which is exactly what ""Avatar"" does).  Wikus is just as racist towards the aliens as the average person. He regularly calls them Prawns, calls them ""Fookin' creatures"" when accusations are made that he had sex with one of them, he is mean and nasty to some of the Prawns that get unruly or uppity during the eviction, and threatens to take away CJ's son when he throws a lollipop at Wikus's head.

Even when Christopher is trying to help him, Wikus remains racist. It isn't until the end that he comes to realize that Christopher is his friend. Even then, we aren't given any ""big revelation"" moment to show that he's changed. Well... we are, but not in that way! Puns ahoy~!

It's violent, gory, has ""foul"" language, and it will make you cry. It is also one of the best movies of the year, potentially of the decade.

And it bears mentioning... Avatar put on a visual spectacle for $300 million that turned out to be a colorful Candyland version of ""Dances With Wolves"" without any of the compelling drama.

District 9 more than exceeds it at literally 1/10th the budget. And while there wasn't as much CG, it bears mentioning that the Prawns are ALL CG, and they look just as realistic as any creature in Avatar---perhaps even more so.

There's more than a dozen deleted scenes. A bunch of them are full-fleshed out scenes from the documentary bits, such as a full version of the aside showing a Nigerian explaining how a piece of alien flesh cures STDs.

The best ones are scenes of the eviction, without any CG, showing Jason Cope, who plays Christopher Johnson, standing in for all the Prawns. For the ease of dialogue, he speaks in English, but his intonation and behavior is pure Prawn. And it's just hilarious, seeing him there, physically acting like a Prawn, and saying things that the Prawns say in English. The best one to me was when they caught him stealing televisions.

There's much documentaries covering the making of the film and its various aspects, and director commentary which is of great quality of information on the filmmaking and background of it, including background of Johannesburg.

Picture quality on the Blu Ray is perfect, as expected.",1262736000,,7444,4.776653696498054

  District 9 is one of the most thought provoking movies that I have seen in years.  I'm not sure what the American viewing public has degenerated into these days, but some of the comments here sadden me.  This movie examines the human condition in a very unique way.  Yes, it is very graphic and can be disturbing.  There is no nudity or sex however.  There is no pandering to audiences.  It is powerful and pulls no punches.  I have heard comparisons to Blade Runner, another favorite to many sci-fi fans.  If that type of a movie is your cup of tea, District 9 will blow you away.  It succeeds on so many levels, please give it a chance.  Despite being an action based movie, District 9 is for intelligent viewers, not Michael Bay movie lovers.  District 9 is a strong 4/4 star movie.",1262649600,43,1038,4.389473684210526

3981842,3,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is not a SciFi movie, its a social commentary on the human condition in Africa. The movie is about the millions of displaced refugees all over the region, living in poverty and squaller, with no home to return to and no government or people who wants them. Its about the state of affairs in the camps and the abuse of the refugees by their so called benefactors. The Prawns, shrimp like alien creatures are a symbol for the way that these refugees are treated and looked at as subhuman...  SciFi fans will be dissappointed!

3981848,2,B002SJIO5O,"This movie has far too many holes in its storyline for it to be considered a good movie.  The director and producers are hoping that you only notice the good CGI work and ignore the rest.  As you watch it, you will see more and more holes develop where events happen or the main character performs a feat that should in no way be successful, but is.  Plus the fact that it is shot to look like handheld footage, this is more of a bad Cloverfield than anything else (and that wasn't a good movie either).

The holes in the storyline are obvious if you have seen the Bourne movies - these movies have very few, if any, parts of the plot where you can't believe that he got away with something, or that he did a task that didn't get him caught.  In this movie, the main character does too many things that miraculously turn out OK, although if you think about it for a minute there is no way he should have gotten away with it.

Don't waste your time, the CGI is good but not good enough to warrant watching it.  If you want to see a movie with great special effects AND a great story, watch JJ Abrams' Star Trek - now that was the best movie of 2009.",1262563200,5,1148,4.121076233183857

The combination of political intrigue, poignant views on racism, questions of ""un""-human rights, the science fiction genre (specifically about aliens), and spot on specially effects, should have made this a 5 star reveiw. The fact is, it just missed on all of these points. The set up is great, but the plot is lacking. The acting was also sub-par, save for Sharlto Copley, who I thought did a decent job.

3981851,4,B002SJIO5O,"I am as soft as melted ice cream and won't watch gory or disturbing film, and I had no problem with the level of violence portrayed in this film, so rest easy those of you with gentle dispositions.

This film could be interpreted by some as an unsophisticated look at South Africas treatment of their minorities, and I suspect part of the reason that the film plays so well in a South African setting is how easily the humans subjugate the aliens, and what an unlikable bunch of arrogant people they collectively seemed to come across as in the film.

Its nice to see Lethal Weapon 2's nice work in generating South Africans as your stereotypical evil race in films. Now we have Arabs, the British and South Africans taking the traditional role of the Russians prior to the break up of the cold war.

The fact that the central character is so unlikable, and has the name Wikus (I could only think of Michael Palins Pilate in Life of Brian saying ""Wikus Dickus"") is a masterstroke, why should films have a likeable star just to make everyone feel all warm and lovely about themselves. Sometimes, stuff happens to those who aren't Brad Pitt or Matt Damon types and they have to deal with it as best they can.

Also an interesting counterpoint is the fact that the black population is as enthusiastic as subjugating the aliens as the white, perhaps not seeing their own history reflected in the plight of the ""Prawns"", it must be remembered that the spaceship arrived in Jo'burg when Apartheid was still at its height, and some back-story perhaps integrating the arrival of the ship into the breakdown of that social system might have strengthened the story a little.

Which brings me to my biggest gripe, the lack of back-story isn't critical in this film, but would have added a lot to my enjoyment of the film, where did they come from, why did they come to earth, why were they in such a poor state when they got here, why didn't they defend themselves against the humans with their advanced weapons?

This is overall, however, a film about human nature, and could be transplanted across our globe and throughout our history when a dominant society subjugates a submissive one, and as such makes provoking and interesting viewing.",1262563200,4,2231,4.66412213740458
3981852,3,B002SJIO5O,"I admire the style of this movie.  But the first half mocumentary was very hard to watch.  Like the original Star Trek TV series, this is a social commentary disguised as Science Fiction. It browbeats you over & over again about what happened in South Africa, substituting Aliens for the Black Africans.  Yes, what happened there wasn't right, but do we have to see it dramatized as a documentary over & over again?  Even with almost 20 minutes of the oiginal documentary footage edited out, it still plays too long. Strangely the producers say they were not over preachy about their topic.

The ""hero"" of this movie is hardly anyone to like, and no characters are developed to help bring the story around.

This is pure shoot-em-up, blood spurting (& landing on the camera's lens) action with little real story or character developement to follow.  And what little story there is never really gets resolved.  Who are these people & aliens in this story?  You will never really know, they are more like players in a video game.

The producers admit that they originally gathered to produce the HALO movie.  When that fell through for them they ran across this script.  This probably explains why it feels like a video game.

Is it a bad movie?  No. But it is not something to watch over & over again.  One viewing is enough, and I was tempted to hit the fast-foward button quite a few times.",1262563200,2,1391,4.6204081632653065

The special effects are outstanding, especially with the alien visitor icky bugs. Using their real speech with sub-titles was a stroke of genius.

I keep reading some of the ""reviews"" of this movie and just don't understand why so many people placed so much ""hope"" in District 9 and then were So Let Down.  IT'S A MOVIE!  But I think when all is considered here, such as the budget, the director  ( for that matter the lead character  has No acting experience before this production), and the absolute uniqueness of the entire effort, one has to re-weigh what ends up on the screen vs how it is judged.  That being said, you also have to Pay Attention to this movie.  Oh, and don't watch District 9 at home while the kids are running around screaming for dinner as you pause the DVD player over and over again.

While the special effects were great and the sound was fantastic, both of which you would expect from WETA and Jackson, the film itself was just far too bland to be enjoyable.

Problems we had with it:
- The main character was a dud. Nothing was exciting about this guy. He was just a nerd whose life was ultra boring and we found the over focus on this aspect of the story to go on seemingly forever.
- The aliens, while looking very interesting, were anticlimactic. I suppose it is the scenario that they are put in for the movie but I found them to be very uninteresting. Too little focus on their origin, technology, etc.
- Very off-balanced mix of action and storytelling.
- Too much time in the movie where nothing significant happens - i.e. just too much 'filler' content that isn't significant.

Flashy graphics and special effects and Jackson's name just aren't enough anymore to make a movie a hit. While we love his past work, he needs to do better than this to impress us.",1262476800,14,1119,4.534653465346534

""District 9"" is indeed a novel depiction of aliens, as others have said.  Rather than coming to earth as our would-be conquerors or superiors, these aliens are mostly lower-class worker bees who lack the social sophistication you would expect of beings capable of manning, let alone creating, their massive space ship, which remains hovering over the city for decades after their arrival.  These aliens are a ragtag lot on their last leg as they stagger into our world.  After they arrive, they are housed en masse in a slum by their human caretakers, who ultimately must take on a role closer to prison guards.  There the aliens display all of the social unrest and lack of civility you might find in any slum on earth where humans reside.  The problems spill over and begin to negatively affect the local human population, which leads to the decision to relocate the aliens to a refugee camp further from the city.  We follow the human administrator tasked with overseeing this effort as he works his way through the alien slum on what seems to be the ridiculous errand of delivering eviction notices to the aliens in preparation for the move.  What's so absurd about the whole thing is that some of the aliens begin randomly fighting with and even killing members of the human security detail as this vulnerable administrator--depicted as the quintessential office-cubicle nerd--continues to make his rounds on foot.  All the while, he is being videotaped for what appears to be a news report or documentary.  Rather than retreat from what starts to feel like a war zone, the humans just pick up the body parts of their eviscerated comrades and keep up the ridiculous formality of serving eviction notices.  Eventually, a human becomes infected with something the aliens have brought, and we spend the rest of the film following his plight and the reactions of the humans and aliens around him.

""District 9"" takes a long time to get rolling, and once it does, it fails to make any meaningful statements about anything.  Set in post-apartheid South Africa, the film pretends to teach lessons about xenophobia and segregation, but the aliens make themselves such unwelcome guests among their human benefactors that they generate zero sympathy from viewers when the humans make what seems to be the very rational decision to relocate them away from the human population.  The reaction by the humans in charge when they discover one of their own has been infected is over-the-top, but if anything, their actions are motivated more by greed or concern for public safety than xenophobia.  About the only thing this film succeeds at is turning cinematic stereotypes about aliens on their ear.  Bottom line is ""District 9"" is a long way to go for much less payoff than the hype surrounding this film would suggest.  What little payoff there is largely comes in the form of action once the bullets start flying.

I'm somewhat shocked that Peter Jackson was associated with this film at all (he was the producer).  It is nowhere near the level of his earlier ""Lord of the Rings"" films or ""King Kong"" (all of which he directed).  Much of this $30-million film has a low-budget indy-production feel, in part due to the excessive use of shaky hand-held cameras, which quickly becomes annoying to watch.  There are some high-quality CGI aliens and special effects, but they are not enough to save this film from its lack of character development or a meaningful plot.  As a result, when bad things start to happen to the infected human, we're not so much caught up in the drama of his plight as we are dispassionate observers of the mayhem that ensues.  The film's resolution only raises questions that expose obvious plot holes.

If you need to find out what the buzz surrounding ""District 9"" is all about, pay your local video rental store a visit.",1262476800,13,4073,4.799426934097421

3981861,4,B002SJIO5O,"It's not often that we get a science-fiction movie, and a high-profile one for the big screen, that takes a rather unusual approach. A number of things were unique or at least from the expected - the dynamics of the situation, the aliens and their ""agenda"", intentionally de-framing some of the obvious questions one would want to see answered, and things like that (I don't want to spoil the plot for those who haven't seen it yet).

It is not often that I watch a big scifi/action movie and have no idea what is going to happen next. This was the case with D9. I simply couldn't have predicted the twists and turns. It was that outside the box. It is sort of the opposite of watching an episode of TNG where you could see things coming.

Unfortunately what could have been one of the best scifi movies ever was disrupted by what movie executives want to see in movies to bring the masses to the movie theaters - non-stop action, guns, explosions, cool-tech, deaths, etc. And it's not that these should be avoided, but in the case of this movie, they got in the way of what could have made it a very special movie.

One of the other elements that made this movie different is that it just avoided getting in-depth. It's as if they were telling the story from the perspective of someone watching it off a tangent and couldn't keep his hands (no pun intended) from changing the channels on the remote. It was filmed and framed not from the perspective we usually see. Perhaps by design, perhaps not, but it gave it a different feel.

And by doing this they avoided a lot of the cliches that make it hard to take some of the scifi-action blockbuster movies seriously. Other than the shoot-em-ups of course.

Perhaps I, as the viewer, just doesn't want to be reminded of(make that force fed) an infamous part of history yet again!

3981864,1,B002SJIO5O,"Usually I make a long and dedicated review when I give a movie a 1 star rating. I point out all it's flaws and just what makes it so bad. However, this movie doesn't even deserve that respect. I don't even know how to classify this film. The main character is highly unlikeable, the aliens are highly offensive(like you can't tell they were meant to portray minorities),The story takes too long to get going and when it does it ends up absolutely no where.

 The Back of the DVD case says that this is an ""EDGE OF THE SEAT!"" film. If you mean I was sitting on the edge of my seat to get up and take this out my DVD player you are absolutely correct.

 This is not at all what I thought it was going to be. If you could imagine mixing Mr. Bean/ID4/ALIENATION/BOYZNTHEHOOD/THELORDOFWAR/E.T./& HURRICANE KATRINA FOOTAGE, you just might come out with District9! I haven't watched a movie this bad in a very long time. The only good parts of this film worth remembering are the action sequence which are very well done (no complaints at all) but that's the only thing that salvages this movie from the ""zero star"" rating I wished I could give it. I guess I'm mad because I paid to see this film. It's more suitable as one of those SCI-Fi original flicks they show from time to time. Matter of fact it's just like those except with better special effects.

 This is a FF movie...meaning it's one that you Fast Forward through most of it just to get to the interesting parts. The ending of district 9 is open and unsatisfying as hell. When you sit through a movie like this you don't want a ""What happens next?"" ending. You want a complete ending that finishes the movie off with no questions asked (this isn't ""War of the Worlds"").

 The main character isn't at all likeable. He's more like a used car salesman. You know some quirky slime ball that just wants to smile and grin at you so he can get what he wants. The type of guy that pushes morals aside just so long as he comes out on top. That's pretty much the main character in a nut shell. You don't care what happens to him because he is annoying and you for some reason just want him to get killed off but it never happens because he is unfortunately the main guy. Other than him you won't meet anyone else that's likeable unless you want to count in the alien acquaintances that come in way later in the film.

Bottom line-

 District 9 just isn't a satisfying film to watch. A made for T.V. movie sure... but a theatrical piece... not hardly.

However I'm sure there are plenty of professional reviewers who see otherwise and would give this film 2 thumbs up, but since Tri-Star hasn't given me a wad of cash to lie through my teeth as they... I will have to tell the truth. Watch this when it comes to basic cable. Do not rent, do not buy, do not waste your money on this one.",1262304000,16,2831,4.3107344632768365
3981865,1,B002SJIO5O,"This was an unrelenting exercise in the examination of human misery--obviously based on the personal societal background of the movie's director.  The darkness at the center of this movie, so directly based in South African social and racial inequities, makes it really difficult to find anyone or anything about the film worthy of any sympathy.  A major part of the film is devoted to the misery of a petty bureaucrat who gets ""infected"" by the aliens and who starts transforming into one of them. The squalid nature of the bureaucrat and his life makes it difficult to do anything other than watch the misery of his transition in disgust and in the realization that he deserved it.

The aliens, as can be expected in exercises in self-revulsion such as this, were portrayed as being the nasty products of a nasty situation, but they were portrayed as having nobility.  However, it is difficult to appreciate the nobility of indiviudals as degraded and nasty as the aliens in this film.

In many ways, I'd characterize this movie as yet another entry in the corrupt-overlord/noble-subjugated sweepstakes.

An ending comment: as memory serves, most of the substance needed to power the shuttle and ship was destroyed in the film-ending fight.  Why did it take so long for them to get their acts together to leave?  Do they like being degraded that much?  Why was it left to a lone alien engineer and his offspring to get everything together?  In a space faring civilization, wouldn't some sort of organized effort have been made to get the substance together so that they could leave or send for help? It seems that several plot holes attack the internal credibility of the film.

One here or there I can accept as realistic, but not *that* many.

As for the violence, it's not the level of violence --- which I can see as ""realistic"" --- but rather it being so graphical.  Was it really necessary to show every single death as it happened?

That said, the film is very, very good.  I especially liked how the friendship developed between Wikus and Christopher the alien and the alien's son.

This film was very different in that it dealt with an alien invasion in a 3rd world country that is technologically not advanced and in the world's most poorest continent. I thought the story was great dealing an ordinary citizen going against the aliens, and then turning one into himself fights along side them. It's amazing the lies the media spun against him and how quick his father in law was to profit from him and his wife turn against him. I thought that was the true horror and the possible experimentation of MNU and being profited over with his body and the other aliens. In this film it was weird to see that the aliens were technologically advanced, but were dumb enough to be lured and encamped by Humans. Also it did not show the good sign of Human nature (much like the recent release of Avatar). When strangers from another world arrive at our door step how do we treat them? I also don't believe that the super powers of the world-the US, EU, China, Russia, Brazil would even allow South Africa to deal with Aliens as it has been given the track record of a slow developing country with escalating problems of it's own.

As originality has become scarce in several art fields, District 9 shines as a beacon of creativity, and undoubtedly will join the pedestal with other giant works of sci-fi such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brave-New-World/dp/0060850523/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brave New World</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fahrenheit-451/dp/B000TZ19TC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fahrenheit 451</a>. What these best of the best sci-fi works have in common is that they convey a strong critic of our society while entertaining, and their main accomplishment is that they are welcomed by all audiences, so you do not have to be a sci-fi fan or a nerd to enjoy it. Another distinct feature of District 9 is that the story is not based nor inspired by an existing novel, but on a 2005 short film created by Director Blomkamp himself.

Mr. Sharlto Copley (Wikus) performance is outstanding, and the film unfolds so unexpected that it is very difficult to guess what is coming next or how it is going to end. Be aware though that similarly to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fahrenheit-451/dp/B000087F6L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fahrenheit 451</a>&nbsp;movie, the beginning is a bit slow and even confusing due to Mr. Blomkamp's love for documentary-style filming, but bear patiently the first 30 minutes, the movie changes the rythm and you are not going to regret it. I have not watched such an excellent movie for a long time, and this probably one of the best movies of the 2000s.

I bought the film on Blu-ray Disk (BD) format but actually the fast action is limited to the last third of the movie, so it will not make that much difference if you buy it on the cheaper DVD format. However, I love the extra goodies included in the BD package (I got the film at a brick and mortar store, Amazon's description does not say anything about these extras), particularly the free digital copy that you can download and can watch in your PC or your iPOD. Also included was a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PlayStation-3-120-GB/dp/B002I0J4VQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PlayStation 3 120 GB</a>&nbsp;playable game demo. Look for the packages specially marked with this promotion (it seems this is a limited time promotion with most recently released BDs).

As the doors were left open for a sequel; let's hope Mr. Blomkamp's creativity and quality content are kept at the same level, quite a daunting task in the movie industry where money talks louder than art. Despite their completely opposite approaches, District 9 and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avatar/dp/B002VPE1B6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avatar</a>&nbsp;surely are the two best sci-fi films of the abundant 2009 crop.

3981876,3,B002SJIO5O,"I quit reviewing for a reason, so I'm reluctant to do this.  So take it for what it's worth - absolutely nothing (just like all subjective commentaries on film.)

At what point does originality become more important than actual entertainment.  District 9 is a movie made for industry types, critics, burgeoning film-makers, etc. more than the majority looking for a fun 2 hour escape.  So its critical success is understandable.  But, it's commercial success is less clear.  I wonder if the film would have lured as many people into theaters if not for Peter Jacksons name being attached to what appeared to be a big-budget alien invasion.  The trailers do a great job of not giving too much away, unfortunately, they border on deceptive advertising.

Take some annoying, self-promoting, superficial corporate type that might earn 2 minutes of screentime in a movie like ID4 and make an entire movie surrounding his exploits.  That seems to be the gist of the story.  To be fair, District 9 is a little bigger than that.  It tosses in a cliched metaphor or two, hoping people won't notice how shallow the plot.  But, it plays like a group of producers made a bet at the end of their weekly card game whether or not they could capitalize on what amounts to a 2 hour newscast on a grand scale.  As a former movie-critic, I can appreciate the technical execution of the film itself.  But, as a more humble movie enthusiast, I found the documentary style of filmmaking, the detached storytelling, and the unsympathetic characters more annoying than clever.  Just because something is fresh or new doesn't make it worthy.  I could put peanut-butter on a hamburger, but who would want to eat it?  Does it taste better because some culinary ""authority"" who's become embitterd from constantly eating the best food, thinks it's fresh and exciting?

The special effects are absolutely fantastic, though.  And it's good to see a more pseudo-intellectual type of film merit big budget effects.  But, in this case the story just didn't do it for me, nor the storytelling.  But that's just my arrogant opinion.  Please don't let it or any other sway you for or from the film.

There are many things to love about this movie, especially the genre-bending. I liked how we gain sympathy for the aliens, and how well District 9 was shot. The technology is quite convincing, the characters interesting--especially the well-played lead--and overall I thought this was almost a truly classic film.

But, I just couldn't get by the (to me) excessive gore and violence in the early going. It jarred me too much and while it did create some sympathy and antipathy as planned, it also turned me off somewhat. This became clearest towards the middle of the film when we start to really get in the aliens' heads and feel for them, at which point I realized how numb the early gore had made me.

Other than that, I thought this was a very intelligent, engrossing movie that transcended its genre nicely at various points. Jackson's involvement clearly brings world-class visual effects and feel, and that's a major plus. The blu-ray version is fine looking, quite realistic indeed. Take away some of the blood and guts and this might be almost Star Wars-quality, and a great movie for kids as well as sci-fi fans. As it stands, it's still excellent, but with caveats.",1262044800,,1187,4.8088235294117645

3981883,1,B002SJIO5O,"The biggest problem with this film is its lack of realism. For example, a lot of the plot revolves around acquiring the space aliens' weapons - yet, they aren't any better than what earthlings have. Secondly, another theme is the 'rights' afforded to the aliens - eg. notification before they're moved, along with bending over backwards to not offend them, no matter what - to the point of ridiculousness. Third, the commander's choice to lead the effort - his goofball son-in-law - hardly one likely to succeed in anything other than getting himself and others killed. Yet, that would not make the commander look good at all.

The idea for this sci-fi is somewhat original, and the special effects are amazing however gross and disturbing.  In District 9 the aliens look like giant grasshoppers, including spitting black fluid, and are attacked by humans.  The plot says they need to move further out of town and out of sight.  So a team of MNA officials go door to door having the aliens sign away their rights.  (ha-ha?)  Of course they want to stay where they are and fight humans scene after scene.  I don't think this is entertainment.  The movie also kept reminding me of the old thriller, ""The Fly"" where the main character is transformed into a fly. In District 9, the main character slowly turns into one of the aliens, which looks like a 7 foot bipedal grasshopper.

A stalled spaceship over Johannesburg, South Africa brings aliens to earth for 20 years.  The film makes a racist joke of a segregated class (this time space alien)  living fenced off area outside of town - eating garbage is unimaginative.  This has been done often and in many forms.  In the film the slang word for ""alien"" is ""prawn"" - which is insulting to the aliens.

An evil corporation, Multi-National United (MNU) is sent into District 9 to do evictions.  This makes no sense at all.  I guess this was something to laugh at.  The MNU goes to each shanty and knocks on the door asking the alien who lives there to sign a release, that they know they will be moved.  If they don't sign, they shoot them.  Huh?  The movie gets messy and messier.  It seems like the first part was more structured at least, but then the majority of the movie turns into a crazy fight that goes on and on.  Gags such as the aliens liking cat food, alien weapons can only be used by Wikus (Sharlto Copley) who plays the human who becomes half-breed.  Of course we hear jokes of making love to the ""prawns"" to start turning into one of them.  It also did not  make sense that the District 9 Slum was controlled by local Nigerian gangs.  Nothing added up other than more people to fight.

So it turned into a generic action movie with special effects, some old jokes entwined, but not very entertaining, not what I wanted or expected.",1262044800,17,2795,4.571428571428571

My reason for writing this review is to ask those who have not watched this GEM of a movie to disregard any negative opinions expressed here and just form their own after seen the movie in its entirety. My wife and I have stopped going to movies because we are tired of being disturbed by Cel phones going off despite the many warnings to turn them off and of people been noisy and walking in and out of the theater in the midle of the show (we live in FLorida and these problems are particularly seen here). We just wait and we enjoy movies at our home theater. Still every once in a while we ""sacrifice"" ourselves and try an ealry showing of a particularly interesting (to us) movie at our local theater.

Somehow we missed this one at the theaters and we found out about it when we saw the ads in Walmart (of all places) that it was ""soon"" coming to DVD and Blue ray. For some reason we both got intigued by the ad, sensing that this was an exceptional movie. We finally got it today and we were both astounded by all aspects of it. Cinematography, acting, effects and most of all STORY are first rate. The violence that so many ""nay sayers"" have a problem with was absolutely necessary for the story line. If you have problem with it then respect the ""R"" rating and avoid watching it. Please do NOT watch this movie with your own preconcieved ideas about what a ""good"" sci-fi movie should be because it is like going into a gourmet restaurant and rating it low because it did not have McDonalds Burgers... I read various negative reviews here in Amazon and in all honesty NOT ONE of them really gave me a valid reason for the low rating. Most of them came from people that walk into a movie and already know what they want to see (more or less like ""Snakes on Plane"") or from people that just HAVE to say something negative about a movie that a lot of them did not even watch in whole. Or others that did not even ""get"" the movie at all and gave it poor ratings when they gave 5 stars to movies like GI Joe or Transformers. By the way, I DID like BOTH Transformer movies but I got exactly what I expected: Great Effects and a POP Corn movie. Nothing wrong with this but every now and then (actually MOST often than not) I prefer watching movies that surprise me with their story, cinematographic approach and message. This movie has all of these elements in spades. The movie ""had"" in the first coupe of minutes it started. I immediately ""knew"" that this was a special movie and a real treat and I was not dissapointed.

My wife is NOT a fun of as she calls them ""war"" and overly violent movies but she was captivated by this one. She rates it as one of the best movies she ever saw...and so do I. Up there with Alien, The Fly and Blade Runner for me!

3981890,5,B002SJIO5O,"""District 9"" is such a great film on many levels. The first thing that comes to mind is the apartheid that hamstrung the country it takes place in, for so many years. It was disheartening to see it resurrected once more, not for the Blacks, but the aliens (which is in itself curious, because there are blacks in the film treating the aliens as they were once treated).
The aliens themselves seemed like animals at times, and being human, we tend to ""lessen"" them because of this. Of course, their societal norms are very different from ours, and because of this, they tend to be a bit shall we say....Destructive? So they are segregated.
You are immediately immersed in the film from the very start, because of the ""Live news coverage"" nature of the film. The ""live roving camera"" style isn't as bad as far as motion sickness goes, and the violence is VERY convincing. The aliens (or ""Prawns"" as they are derisively called) for being CGI, are, as well. So much so, that one would probably not bat an eye if they actually showed up in ""person""!
The secretive and subversive nature of the MNU (or ""MultiNational Union"") is also convincing, because so many nations already do these sorts of things, already. It's henchman soldiers hark back to the French Foreign Legion, because they operate in much the same way as the FFL did, in it's heyday.
I found the film touching, in some respects, because the Human protagonist, Wikus Van De Merwe, Only found his humanity, when it was finally lost, and the alien protagonist, ""Christopher Johnson"", found that not all humans are evil, but just ""misguided"".
Peter Jackson hit a homer with ""District 9"". He also left considerable room for sequels, as well, which is good, because I would very much like to see some threads resolved.

I recommend ""district 9"" not for it's SFX, or it's acting, action, or camera work. It is recommended because it leaves you thinking long after the credits (because my assessment here, is not the only conclusion you may be left with). easily 5 stars!",1261872000,,2022,4.711864406779661
3981891,5,B002SJIO5O,"Lately, Hollywood has seen science fiction films as a way to show off: look at what we can do, look at how creative and imaginative we are.  DISTRICT 9, thankfully, follows in the tradition of what science fiction set out to be: thoughtful, deep, with resonance in our contemporary culture.

The film follows a colony of roughly one million aliens (dubbed ""prawns"" due to their crustacean appearance) that have essentially crash-landed on earth.  Unable to go anywhere else, they have been restricted to District 9 in Johannesburg, a run-down shantytown typical of refugee camps.  After 20 years, the inhabitants of Johannesburg have become fed-up with their neighbors.  It is time for the prawns to be relocated.  However, in the midst of handing out eviction notices, Wikus Van De Merwe (an outstanding, Oscar-deserving Sharlto Copley) becomes infected with a prawn concoction, a substance that is slowly altering his DNA.  Wikus is suddenly forced to side with a people he has subjugated and ridiculed, and must fight to save not only his own humanity, but the existence of an entire species.

It's true, DISTRICT 9 becomes bogged down near the end in special effects.  Still, the first two-thirds of the film are phenomenal, showcasing humanity's interaction with what we don't understand.  The effects alone are worth the price of admission; the effects are outstanding, with the aliens interacting flawlessly with the humans around them.  Yet it's the story, the emotional power behind it, that will help DISTRICT 9 stand the test of time.  This will go down as a science fiction classic, another in a long tradition of sci-fi films that dig deep beneath the human skin, that aim to shine a spotlight on our human foibles.",1261872000,,1728,5.024561403508772

I find it fascinating that this movie holds up to any over-marketed and over-hyped Hollywood flotsam with a new director and fraction of a typical budget.
While it is sometimes sad to see the aliens forced to live in such squalor it reminds us that societies all over the world are capable of intolerance (not just the US).

Spoilers... See the movie before reading about it. The performance of Sharlto Copley as the bureaucrat named Wikus Sharlto is pitch perfect and the entire film was well cast. Great writing and acting here folks. Wilkus is no action hero  la Tom Cruise or Bruce or take your Hollywood pic. The alien ship, technology and weapons are very convincing. The alien weapons are freakin' awesome. Seriously. As engaging as District 9 is, this ain't no non-stop action flick but when we get to shooting people and blowing stuff up, well I felt very satisfied. The aliens, referred to disdainfully as ""pawns"" by humans, resemble our crustaceans. They are very, well, ""alien"". They're physically bizarre looking and speak in a strange ""clicking"" language. Fortunately people can learn to understand it and the pawns can understand us. These aren't your stereotypical bad guy invader aliens or our angelic Spielberg variety. In fact one of the most interesting aspects of District 9 is the depiction of aliens as very strange creatures surely from out of this world, but at the same time very down-to-earth as well. They are animals like us and have needs (some very comical) and weaknesses and it's fascinating to see the economy developed between human and alien. Some are smarter than others. Doing the film as faux documentary was a brilliant stroke and added a helluva edge. The story mostly unfolds in filthy urban squalor. Distrcit 9 is the name of the camp the aliens are contained in. This science fiction movie is set in Johannesburg, South Africa. Not New York, L.A., Washington D.C. And the setting is crucial to what this highly entertaining sci-fi tale is really about. It's about us of course and it's about what ugly creatures we humans can be. We selfish and fearful humans with our xenophobia and racism and corrupt bureaucracies and greed trumps all morality ethos of the corporate elite and ineffective, corrupt and two-faced governments. There is personal redemption in this story, but when it's all said and done we're left wondering, what next? And I love that.

To say some obvious things: Why District 9 is among the best films of 2009 and one of the best science fiction films of all time is because it has the qualities that great films posses. These of course include great direction, excellent script and original story telling, interesting setting, terrific acting, thought provoking social/political commentary, visually striking and highly imaginative sets and effects, good dramatic tension, etc...

This movie deserves to be appreciated more and I predict it will be appreciated more in the long-term like so many classic films the public was a tad slow with.",1261872000,3,2701,5.008908685968819

Producer Peter Jackson and director Neill Blommkamp have fashioned a visceral examination of social mores and intolerance that resonates even when the movie morphs into the standard shootemup.

3981896,5,B002SJIO5O,"First of all I loved, *loved* Children of Men for many of the same reasons as I loved D9. If you didn't enjoy CoM then you may not enjoy D9.

Though the beginning starts out slow, the documentary-style interviews really set up the rest of the film. The interviews with Wikus are very character-revealing and let you begin to see how and why he does what he does throughout the rest of the film. The interviews with the other experts set up a realistic environment (but only if you're looking for it, some viewers will laugh off many of the serious interview conversations) and they foreshadow a coming darkness in the story.

Throughout the film I found myself becoming more and more emotionally attached to Wikus. At different points I thought he was funny, sad, scary, and inspiring, a pretty good range for a relatively unknown actor. By the end when he was describing a picture of his angelic wife I was almost choked up, pretty good for a director's first film about aliens coexisting with humans.

Technically the film is somewhat uneven. The explosions are usually very cool to see, especially the smoke clouds with lightning in them, but sometimes the prawns aren't rendered as good as they probably could be. The human explosions are pretty intense and visually interesting but for me a bit too violent and too frequent. Definitely not a movie for people who can't handle frequent and sometime grotesque violence. The other technical aspect that may turn some people off is documentary-style shaky cam. The camera moves aren't nearly as violent as those in Cloverfield and the entire movie isn't shot by a handheld, only a small portion of it, so it may be tolerable for those who had trouble with Cloverfield.

All in all, if you want to see a gritty, original sci-fi shot in a very lived-in world that harkens back to the settings of Children of Men and even further back to those of Blade Runner, do yourself a favor and check out District 9.",1261785600,2,1954,4.688046647230321

One can detect many implications and ideas here, from racism and xenophobia to the problems of refugees, to the status that would be given to aliens who are stuck here, to the morality of using them for medical experiments, and much more.  You don't need to be a sci fi fan to understand the deeper meanings of what the filmmakers are getting across.  They also have done a fantastic job with the aliens--their look, their movements, and even their expressions.

3981902,4,B002SJIO5O,"Directed by newcomer Neill Blomkamp, District 9 opens with an introduction of the character Wikus Van De Merwe (played be another newcomer, Sharlto Copley) and a series of mock news footage compiled together imitating a documentary. The footage shows that during the 1980s, an alien vessel landed (sort of) in Johannesburg, South Africa and was unable to leave. It is never explained why the aliens are here, only that people hate and fear them. The aliens are referred to only as ""Prawns."" This is something of a derogatory term and they were labeled this because of the way they look. Anyway, these Prawns were quarantined in an area isolated from humans. This area quickly became a slum complete with crime, extreme poverty, and militarized security. Wikus is a field operative for a organization known as Multinational United (MNU) and is promoted to a position where it becomes his responsibility to inform the Prawns that they are to be evicted to a district 10, which is even smaller and more isolated that the current living conditions; while doing so, he destroys Prawn eggs and smiles to the camera. A little over half of the film is shot in the manner of a documentary and is incredibly reminiscent of footage of real life refugee camps. The film's commentary on the conditions is obvious and it becomes incredibly easy to sympathize with the Prawns, especially when we are introduced to Christopher Johnson, a Prawn who is considerably smarter than the others we are introduced to and displays more emotion than many of the humans in the film. His plan is to repair a ship that will allow him to rescue his people from the hellhole that they are forced to live in. Things get complicated when Wikus gets infected with a special fluid that slowly, in a manner reminiscent to Jeff Goldblum's transformation in The Fly (his teeth fall out, etc.), begins changing him into a Prawn.

District 9 works incredibly well in a number of ways: The documentary style portions of the film are easily the strongest, as they create a scenario that feels real and is all too comparable to actual historical situations, more specifically, the apartheid system of racial segregation that was in South Africa for many years. The title is even a reference to District 6, which was one such location in Cape Town in the 60s. The visual effects are very impressive, but with Peter Jackson (Director of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy) credited as a producer, this should come as no surprise. The film loses a bit of its steam towards the end however, and becomes more of a typical action sci-fi film, complete with robot suits (that use the inside the helmet view from Iron Man) and laser guns. It's no surprise that the governments keep the aliens on earth because of the desire for their weaponry. After seeing them in action, it becomes obvious how useful they are at killing people. This begs the question: Why haven't the aliens been using them? Granted, this would be a different film if the aliens willing to fight back, but with such awesome weaponry, you have to wonder what's been preventing them from doing so.

The action scenes are spectacular and dramatic, but cinematically, it contrasts greatly with the documentary footage than dominates the first half of the film. The action scenes and most of the film after mutant-Wikus goes on the run are shot more traditionally and this is clearly intended to personalize the story. But what it causes is a bit of a disruption. It feels like Neill Blomkamp was trying to have it both ways: a meaningful sci-fi commenting on a real world problem and at the same time, a blockbuster with people exploding and giant robots. Both of these things are fine, but together, in the way that the film is structured, it comes off as a bit uneven. That being said, District 9 is still a great film with a message, which is a lot more than can be said about other films this summer. ([...])",1261785600,3,3922,4.732456140350878

When the timid bureaucrat Wikus is charged with leading an operation to transplant the ""prawns"" (as they are called by the locals) to a new camp, he is inadvertently drawn into their plight.

District 9 represents a truly inventive and exciting new voice in science fiction, that at its best tends to exploit the ideas and resources of the genre (aliens, futuristic technology, alternate realities) in order to explore present day issues, such as how we tend to fear, abuse and exploit ""aliens"" on our own planet.  Or how our fears can make us vulnerable, and our ignorance makes us weak.  The film challenges us to ask what it means to be human, especially when we treat other intelligent beings as ""other.""  It's also a thrilling film, that kept me on the edge of my seat.  I loved that the main character was not an ""action star"" but a timid bureaucrat, both likable in his own way and betraying the prejudices of ignorance.

3981913,2,B002SJIO5O,"(since Im getting so many negative votes, I thought I'd rewrite this review for clarity)

If you watch the making of District 9, the writer and director talk about how District 9 began when the production unit that was to make Peter Jackson's aborted 'HALO' movie were put to task by Jackson to come up with an original concept.  A film taking place in the nearby slums of Johannesburg would allow a lower budget film to have some really high end visuals, since there would be little to no costs associated with set creation or transporting the crew to a far off location.

This is something that on the surface gives District 9 an exotic appeal to a western audience. The slums you see in District 9 are REAL, though you won't see real poor people in them, just CGI aliens.

Using aliens as a prop to explore concepts of segregation and racism is hardly new in Science fiction.  Movies like the 1968 Planet of the Apes, the Outer Limits episode 'the Zanti Misfits', the Star Trek episode 'Let that be your last battlefield'... Heinlein's ""Starship Troopers"", the Fuzzy books by H. Beam Piper... the books of Octavia Butler.  There are countless examples.  Science Fiction at it's best is a literature and cinema of social commentary.

Rod Serling, creator of the Twilight Zone, once said that if he wrote a story about a black man being framed for the murder of a white woman, the TV censors would hand him his hat, but if he set the story in the future and made the black man a robot, they were fine with it.

In response to Serling's comment, one could ask what a robot has to do with a black man.  The same could be said for the alien 'Prawns' who inhabit the fictional, yet very real slum of District 9.  When you 'explore' a concept, do you take any responsibility for the people that you generalize, or marginalize?

The making of documentary explains that District 9's creation did not involve a story, but rather a sequence of short vignettes and ideas that were taken from a larger group of concepts.  This viewer found the film very much felt like this.  Random.  And I don't have a problem with the technical execution of the material, it's very well done.  It LOOKS very real.  The high definition is outstanding, one of the best blu rays Ive seen.

To get at what doesn't work, and why I find this film more exploitive than enlightening, I need to get into the plot.

SPOILER ALERT:

Wikus van de Merwe is an employee of the MNU, a Multi National Arms and policy dealing organization.  He is portrayed as being dim-witted and apathetic towards the plight of the Prawns.  20 years earlier, the Prawns arrive in a stalled space ship, where presumably some virus has killed off their leadership caste, leaving only the workers, who are portrayed as being neither bright or outgoing, except in their hunger for rubber tires and cat food.
During a collection of legal signatures pending a illegal eviction of the Prawns from District 9 to a newer, more concentration-camp-like facility, Wikus seizes and is accidentally exposed to a vial of concentrated alien fuel compound, collected by one lone rogue Prawn scientist, Christopher Johnson, and his son.
Slowly Wikus begins to transform (ala the 1986 'the Fly', complete with a rehash of the fingernail removal gimmick) into a Prawn.  He soon becomes a valuable commodity to MNU, because he can now fire the alien weaponry, some possesed by the MNU, some scattered throughout the slums, which most of the Prawns have traded away to a Nigerian warlord for cat food. Humans can not fire the alien weapons because their DNA is not compatible.  Until now.
Wikus escapes his captors, forms an uneasy alliance with Christopher Johnson, who reveals that the fuel compound will power up the command module of the abandoned mothership, and that alien medicine will allow Wikus to be cured...

There's nothing wrong with the story, but the main focus is the weaponry. You're supposed to be frightened by the idea of people getting their hands on it, yet you end up cheering everytime Wikus messily explodes a bad guy with the lightning gun, because it's a cool cracked out Monty Python effect.  You root for Christopher Johnson to escape with his son, even though he leaves behind all his people, saying he won't return for 3 years.

As a black comedy, District 9 might well succeed, but it doesn't try to be one.  It seems to be more concerned with being 'hip' and not trying to fit itself into any genre.

Which is probably a good idea, since the film has no point about racism, other than showing the cut & dried bits of ugly violence you expect from any film that says it 'explores concepts of racism'.  But this isn't a film about Dachau, or the Japanese internment camps.  It's not about real racism, it's about fantasy racism.  It's about people who are willing to kill eachother over guns, and it's about Wikus van de Merwe, a man who you pity more than you like, and an inscutable alien who's motives are never made clear.

But while District 9 looks cool, and has cool weaponry, and titillates us with fantastic violent images, it exists as a facade over an all too real place that does not get a chance to speak.

There are REAL people in District 9. They are not insects and they don't have a spaceship. They are living in cardboard boxes, they're hungry and tired of a government that doesn't listen.  And they are arming themselves. District 9 does not shed any light on those people, rather it just uses their fragile condition as subtext, To ENTERTAIN the people who don't live there, who don't have to see them.

It's well done, and I don't like it.  If they donated a portion of the proceeds from the film for relief in the slum they shot the film in, I might.",1261526400,6,5727,4.606896551724138

He had everything we as people grow up wanting. With the accident that changed it all, he was even more desperate to get his life back above even other's and their lives. Even others that showed him kindness. Thats irksome.

The first part is shot in documentary style and pretty violent. But once it settles down and focuses on the main characters it when it really kicks into gear. T The special effects are good. But unlike so many films with good special effects, it is a human/alien interest story as well with well written characters too. The alien boy's relationship with his father was my favorite and something that we all can relate too in one way or the other.

Movie:  4/5  Video Quality:  5/5  Audio Quality:  5/5  Extras:  4/5  Overall:  4.5/5 (rounded up in total star ranking)

We've all seen sci-fi films and stories where aliens come to Earth and lay down their dominance through superior technology and intellect.  But in the case of ""District 9,"" we have something else entirely.  It's a rough and brutal film, portraying aliens not as the sleek, powerful, awe-inspiring beings from heaven.  Instead, these aliens are wretched, and humans are treating them like dirt.  Therein lies the strength and power of the film; it serves to showcase modern issues concerning refugee camps, shanty-towns, and social corruption, while simultaneously demonizing humanity.  With themes like these, ""District 9"" proves to be a truly unique and thought-provoking experience.

As far as the entertainment value goes, the movie is not bad.  The first half is purely rough documentary-style, with interviews and news footage cut in throughout.  Then the second half resembles an actual film with lots of action (and some very gnarly violence).  As such, the plot is interesting and moves at a decent pace.  The story is generally not bad.  Characters are alright; there are some moments where the people do appalling things or act stupid, but I believe it goes hand-in-hand with the flawed portrayal of humanity in general.  Acting and writing are adequate.  Photography is solid half of the time and a bit shaky at other times; it's pretty good all around.  Production design features some great sets, props, costumes, creature effects, vehicles, and weapons.  Music is decent too.

This disc has good quality.  Video quality is excellent for the most part; most of the movie shows strong sharpness and detail, with excellent color, contrast, and clarity.  A few parts may appear fuzzier or softer due to different cameras or film stocks used for the ""archival footage,"" but overall, the disc offers the highest possible PQ overall.  Sound quality is good (DTS-HD MA 5.1).  This disc includes a number of extras (a commentary, 23 minutes of deleted scenes, documentaries, some interactive features, trailers, and more).",1261440000,,2163,5.221574344023324
3981926,5,B002SJIO5O,"Peter Jackson may be known for his work on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and ""King Kong"" but as producer for the science fiction film ""District 9', needless to say that with his name attached to this project, many people had high expectations.

""District 9' is a film adapted from a 2005 short film ""Alive in Joburg"" directed by Neill Blomkamp (known for his visual effects work for ""Smallville"" and ""Stargate-SG1') that focused on social segregation.  This time around the film (which was budged for around $30 million) would take events that took place in South Africa in District Six, Cape Town during the apartheid era but bring a sci-fi feel that features aliens instead of humans in a camp located in District 9.

Needless to say, TriStar Pictures marketed the film virally on the Internet and despite not having any big name actors in the film, Peter Jackson's name and the teaser trailers featuring the film's awesome special effects would help in creating interest and hype a for the film  and in August 2009, ""District 9' made $37 million in its opening weekend and eventually making over $204 million worldwide.  Now the film makes its entry to Blu-ray and comes loaded with many Blu-ray exclusive special features and also a digital copy of the film.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""District 9' is featured in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and what a gorgeous film does this film turn out to be on Blu-ray.  The film is not only vibrant and colorful, the amount of detail scene is incredible.  From the grime and dirt on Wikus and the surroundings around District 9, to the detail of the clothing and alien and human skin is incredible.  The detail of the broken down, dilapidated slums are brought to life on HD and if anything, this film looks incredible on Blu-ray!  Definitely one of the most amazing looking film to come out on Blu-ray this year from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.  This is a film that is literally ""visual eye candy"", ""District 9' looks fantastic!

As for audio, the lossless audio soundtrack is featured in English and French DTS-HD MA and also features an English audio description track.  And similar to the picture quality of ""District 9', the lossless audio is also fantastic!  There are many action scenes in this film, so from the radio control communications which you hear on all surround channels, gun shots and alien weaponry blasting to the LFE kicking right when the spacecraft starts to move, I was very impressed.  The soundtrack really creates an immersive soundscape and the fact that all surround channels are being utilized, people who own a 7.1 or higher setup will love how ""District 9' will sound on their home theater system.  Absolutely fantastic!

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Hindi.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""District 9' comes with the following special features featured in High Definition and in English Stereo.  Included are:

But overall, good insight from Blomkamp and overall an informative and entertaining commentary.
  * Deleted Scenes - (23:26) A total of 23 deleted scenes.  The deleted scenes are actually quite good and could have added more info. to the film.  But I can understand that they were trying to reduce the time for better pacing but definitely worth watching after the film.

  * Alien Generation: Visual Effects - (10:18) Creating the visual effects for the film and working on a budget.

Note: Before the film starts, you get a menu which you can choose human or alien.  As far as I've seen, the changes are just menu driven - one featuring humans with a red color scheme with the other featuring aliens and blue color scheme.  I have not found any easter eggs or anything at this time to show anything significantly different by choosing a certain menu.

JUDGMENT CALL:

The trailers for ""District 9' may showcase the film a human vs. alien type of sci-fi film but once you start watching the film from beginning to end, you realize how many layers this film has.  It was not meant to be a political film but yet, the film uses the aliens and the segregation that took part in South Africa and so there is a deep underlying tone to the film.

Typically when I see a Summer film or any film that is pushed virally, films such as ""Cloverfield"" have left me felt that there was over-reliance on CG and special effects and at first, before watching this film, I was thinking that ""District 9' would be a film with not much substance but all visually eye candy.  ""District 9' is visual eye candy but it's the good kind of candy that you want from a Blu-ray release.  Awesome picture and audio quality, a lot of special features and for the most part, a film that goes beyond the average ""popcorn-flick"" flair.

Sure, Peter Jackson's name is attached to the film but in truth, you have to hand it to first time director Neill Blomkamp (and also screenwriter Terri Tatchell)  who adapted his short film and was expected to take that short film and make this monstrous sci-fi film with only $30 million dollars.  In contrast, to other 2009 films ""G.I. Joe - Rise of Cobra"" cost $170 million to make, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" cost $200 million to make and here is a film that was shot by a first-time director, features no major stars, shot in a hazardous area, dialogue that was improvised and yes, they director and crew had to cut corners but what an amazing film ""District 9' turned out to be for its low budget, considering how immense this project and film actually came to be.

Actor Sharlto Copley (who plays Wikus Van De Merwe) who has never really acted in a major film was incredible and almost like an Ed Norton who got his first big break with ""Primal Fear"", ""District 9' definitely puts Copley on the map and will be a talent to watch for more and more in the near future.

Overall, ""District 9' turned out to be a pretty smart and deep sci-fi film.  It definitely was not what I was expecting and that's good because it turned out to be much more fulfilling.  Is it a great film?  No.  But it's a pretty solid, thought-provoking sci-film that features a gripping screenplay, awesome special effects and also solid acting.  All from a director, crew (aside from producer Peter Jackson) and cast that we have never heard of.  An ambitious film that looks and feels like it should have cost a lot more to make but in the end, Blomkamp made it happen with a low budget.  The Blu-ray release of ""District 9' actually enhanced my appreciation for this film  and in the end, I feel that this ""District 9' is just too awesome of an HD  release on Blu-ray and definitely earns my recommendation!",1261440000,11,9073,4.793947198969736

I don't mind documentaries but why would someone make one up about alien trailer trash. The aliens were left to die in their UFO by their leaders and when the people of earth finally break in to see whats up, they discover aliens that are starving and in extremely bad shape. All this is shown as a documentary. Interviews with different people giving their take on the aliens. (BORING!!!) Finally a nitwit is assigned to move the aliens to an area that is away from the populace. Like that would happen in real life. Wake up people. If something like that was to happen then we sure as hell would not of picked a complete incompent moron to do the job. After he starts having them moved there is a lot of shooting of the aliens and of the soldiers that are trying to move them. I can't tell you more as I walked out of the theater. I felt my intelligence was insulted.",1261440000,13,966,4.313186813186813
3981928,4,B002SJIO5O,"Sometimes the best way to describe a situation is to come at it from the side. Rather than comment directly on what is happening, use an allegory to describe a situation and discuss it. Such is the case with DISTRICT 9.

Set in the not too distant future, the story is pieced together at first via news footage and interviews, later on depending on the standard filmed story. An alien spaceship hovers over South Africa, motionless in the air. A team is dispatched to enter the vessel and they discover a breed of alien that seems a cross between an insect and a crawfish.

Called prawns due to their bottom feeding nature of scavenging for food, the folks of Johannesburg treat the aliens with a combination of fear and resentment. The story continues as we learn of the aliens settling into an encampment of their own, a shanty town that houses both aliens and a group of Nigerian thugs who trade weapons and run their own crime ring out of District 9.

Enter Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), an employee of MNU (Multi National United).  A Halliburton type group of weapons dealing/mercenary styled executives, they've employ both soldiers and Wikus types, office workers who believe in what their doing with no clue what goes on behind the scenes. Wikus is put in charge of a plan to relocate the ""prawns"" from the shanty town they're in to a new location built with huts for them all.

Going door to door to get their required signatures for the eviction notices, Wikus and his group face everything from attack to verbal confrontation with the ""prawns"". Unbeknownst to him, one alien is in the midst of formulating fuel to power a shuttlecraft to leave the planet. Wikus confiscates the fuel but accidentally is exposed to it. As the film progresses, Wikus personal DNA begins to alter and he starts to take on the aspects of the aliens, watching as first his hand changes into a claw and moving forward.

Of course MNU sees this as an opportunity since the weapons they confiscated from the aliens won't work when held by a human. It seems there is something in the genetic make up of the aliens that causes the weapons to work. Wikus becomes a guinea pig of sorts, used to make the weapons work and kept away from friends and family in a science outpost.

Fearing for his life, Wikus escapes and seeks out the alien he encountered with the vial of fuel for help. He discovers what it was that changed him but also the fact that the only fuel left, the only way for him to receive help, is to recapture the fuel container at the research station he was in.

Should the pair be successful, Wikus may be able to be changed back, the alien return to his home world with his young son and the ""prawns"" finally be treated as something other than outcasts. A battle between the mercenaries employed by MNU and Wikus in a souped up mechanical suit add some action to the tale as we wait to find out what the future holds for all involved.

The story about the mistreatment of those that are different from us is universal to every country in the world. Perhaps that accounts for the popularity of this film when it was released. As Wikus becomes one of them, he is exposed to their treatment and how they are perceived. By becoming one with them, he learns in the process and his outlook on his life and the world around him changes.

As with all great science fiction films, the story is the centerpiece but the surrounding portions add to the whole. The special effects are magnificent, offering us a look at an alien life form that looks as if it is right there, shot on camera without the use of effects. It makes the story all the more believable. And the performances by stars that are relatively unknown in the US make them seem real as well. While grounded in sci-fi, the film makes it seem as if it's taking place now.

Slow going at first, we are given a look at a world we think we known inhabited by creatures we do not. It takes a bit of time to learn about them as well as about ourselves. And in the end, the story we witness makes us think a little bit more about how we react to others. At least let's hope that those who see the film do.",1261353600,9,4158,4.436435124508519

3981932,5,B002SJIO5O,"I think it would be a bit bold to say that this was the best film of the year. However, I did enjoy the sci-fi aspect of it. It has a great underlining story as it is set in South Africa, one of the racial hot spots of the world. But honestly, I felt like the movie was the product of smashing Independence Day with Slumdog Millionaire. There were aliens that could talk and a lot of tin shacks.

One of my biggest questions after watching the movie was ""How can the aliens understand English, but cannot yet speak it?"" To me, that didn't make any sense. The language barrier kept bothering me as I watched the film until the very end. It seemed like no one could understand them, except the main protagonist. And when he responds to them, he doesn't speak in their language, but his own. Eh, perhaps there is a great explanation, but I didn't see one.

It's an interesting film that I enjoyed, but probably wouldn't watch it again. Great themes of racial tension and love, but I prefer Kafka's Metamorphosis.",1261267200,,1009,4.419354838709677

3981935,5,B002SJIO5O,"This movie will blow your mind away -- it truly will. ""District 9"" is the action movie that Hollywood wants to make, should be making, but doesn't seem to find its way or the formula to do so. It is smart, with little known and unknown actors (at least in the USA), awesome special effects, and very entertaining. Add to this a subliminal message to mankind, delivered in an intelligent way.

The story takes place in Johannesburg, South Africa, presumably during present times. It all begins when a huge spacecraft descends from the sky and stays suspended over the city, without completely landing.  The spaceship doesn't move an inch for a long time, and it appears that it is going to remain like that indefinitely. The people in the city get tired of this situation, and the government sends a crew to get access to the spacecraft. They successfully do so, and, to their surprise, they find a million or so starving aliens inside. They are transported to an aid camp for temporary housing.  However, after a while, the aid camp becomes a permanent housing location. In turn, due to the segregation and lack of resources of its inhabitants, this location slowly becomes a slump. After some time, this slump becomes an inconvenience to the population of Johannesburg, who complain about the nature of the ""foreigners"" and the crime wave and additional problems that they generate. A decision is made in which all the extraterrestrials will be relocated to a different location, far from the city. This is an almost impossible task, because the slump has about 1.8 million inhabitants. For this purpose, the government names Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a nerdy-looking employee of MVV (the agency that handles the extraterrestrials) to be in charge of the relocation. At first, Wikus, with the aid of the military, seems to be handling the assignment really well. However, many unexpected problems arise which will determine not only the future of our planet, but Wikus' personal life as well.

Ably directed by Neill Blomkamp, who has a strong background in animation and visual effects, and produced by maverick Peter Jackson, ""District 9"" is an unexpected surprise that will captivate you from beginning to end. It is fun and fast, honest and smart, penetrating to the end. Sharlto Copley shines in his role, and I can bet you that there will be a new installment of this very fascinating saga. The 2-disc DVD set includes deleted scenes, commentary by the director, a filmmaker's log, several making-of segments, and much, much, more.

3981937,4,B002SJIO5O,"The best way to view this film is without knowing anything about it. Truly, it is best going into this completely blind. If you love watching something with an original spin on things, I really think this film has what you want. I mean, how often is it that you see a film where the aliens are the ones kept underneath the humans, treated like the lowest of the low, basically forced to live in their own filth? And that is just the setup to this really cool film. The actors are complete unknowns- and do a fantastic job, especially the lead. The movie itself, filmed quite inexpensively compared to just about anything nowadays, is filled with ridiculously awesome and realistic effects that makes Transformers 2 look like a video game.

The reason I fell in love with District 9 is because this particular brand of Sci-Fi isn't just about effects and aliens and coverups. It actually has a plot, and a heart, so to speak. The humans you learn to despise and the aliens you completlely sympathize with. It's not a common occurance. I don't wish to give any of the plot away, so I will just say that the reason I did not give this film 5 stars is because of how it ended. I wasn't dissatisfied, per se, but I thought it a tad predictable, and is clearly screaming for a sequel.

3981942,5,B002SJIO5O,"After The Lord of the Rings trilogy and King Kong, Peter Jackson was handed the keys to a Halo movie. But work starting on The Lovely Bones (due out December 11, 2009) and the possibility of The Hobbit in his future, Peter Jackson opted to produce and wanted to pass directorial duties to an unknown South African director named Neill Blomkamp. With an unknown director known only for his short films, commercials, and special effects work and a reported $150 million budget for Halo the producers and studio balked at the idea of Blomkamp directing. After Halo fell through, Jackson offered Blomkamp a $30 million budget to direct the film of his choice. The result, a feature length version of Blomkamp's first short film Alive In Joburg called District 9.

District 9 starts as a documentary. Thirty years ago an alien ship came to a halt over Johannesburg, South Africa. After emptying the ship of it's inhabitants, the government segregates the aliens from the humans into a dirty third world camp called, you guessed it, District 9. The aliens who looks like a cross between insects and crustaceans and are referred to as prawns are forced to live in squalor and filth in rickety shacks and have to dig through trash for food or trade their advanced weaponry to Nigerian gangs for cans of cat food (their preferred food). Unfortunately, everything in District 9 isn't as it should be as the humans want them moved even further away from society, so a plan goes into effect to move the prawns even further from society into District 10. A group of officials from a government contracted firm called Multi-National United (MNU), led by Wikus Van De Merwe (newcomer Sharlto Copley) is sent into District 9 to give the prawns eviction notices stating that they have 24 hours to vacate District 9. During the course of their project, though, Wikus accidentally has some mysterious liquid sprayed in his face which has some devastating effects.

District 9 could quite possibly be the best movie I've seen all summer, my only regret is that it didn't come out sooner. It starts out as social commentary dealing with apartheid, the humans take great pleasure in treating the prawns as less than human, shuffling them around, berating them, and even burning down shacks that contain their eggs. It's this sociopolitical relevance that really causes this movie to rise above it's sci-fi peers. On top of that, the movie is shot with a real documentary feel, this adds to the gritty reality of the movie. You believe this is happening because it feels like a documentary you'd watch on the History channel.

On top of that, the acting is superb as well. A special shout out must be given to Sharlto Copley who has no acting experience and had no previous acting experience and had no intention to be an actor prior to Blomkamp's short film, Alive In Joburg. His character Wikus is seen in nearly every scene of the movie and you really feel for him despite his early despicable acts in the movie. You always feel for him and you always root for him, and while that can be attributed to great writing, it takes a great actor to really pull that range off.

The real winner in this movie, and what really blew my mind, though, are the special effects. I don't normally mention budgets when reviewing a movie, but here I think it's important. To give you an idea if you were to look at the other action movies to come out this summer you would see that X-Men Origins: Wolverine cost approximately $160 million to make, Terminator Salvation cost about the same, and Transformers 2 cost about $200 million. On the other side of the spectrum, if you look at comedies, Funny People cost $75 million, and last years Zack and Miri Make a Porno cost $25 million. Hell, back in 1991, Terminator 2 was originally budgeted at $77 million but went way over budget. The point: this movie had as many special effects as, say Wolverine, and cost less than a third of that to make and looks 10x better. Remember, all of the prawns, except the dead ones laying out on tables, were shot completely with digital effects and they all look photo-real. This movie easily looks like a $150 million plus movie.

All in all, I'm really hoping this movie starts a new trend among studios: more original movies. I highly recommend you check it out in theaters, but before you decide to take your kids remember that this movie does earn it's R rating. It has way more than it's fair share of cursing, and exploding bodies (that alien technology will get ya every time). If you have a chance to go alone, or don't mind your kids seeing gore and hearing multiple f-bombs, I suggest you see it now and not just wait for this movie to hit DVD.

On a small TV it may be less intense.. as for the movie itself ( now I am not by any means a sci-fi buff...) I enjoy a good movie.. that's it.. this movie SUCKED.. storyline was simplistic but at the same time I expected some real action to unfold which never did.. the ending, which left me ready to set the screen ablaze, left you and the movie unanswered with the hollow feeling of maybe the next movie would be better... which apparently worked for many who thought it was good.. but for me... and that's all I care about and I believe many think as I do...This Movie= very little action, poor storyline! made you constantly feel something was getting started and you are left wanting when it never does! NEXT!

The viewer will ask these questions... how if the humans brought them down from the ship did they have and keep their weapons to trade with the cat food dealers..? ( which was a absolute joke )They were supposed to be timid... and that was the reason for them to not be worried about them using the weapons, yet many fought the police... why not with the very superior weapons they had.. no leader? not 1 to lead any to revolt ( which is what I waited for the hole time)... I could go on, but who cares.. movie had too many holes to be interesting. Add that to no real action and you get a real lame movie.",1260144000,5,1499,4.2596491228070175

However, after about 15 minutes of watching jittery hand-held, fast-panned, jumpy  movements on the screen, the only sense of urgency I had was to leave the theatre, right away.

The aliens inhabitting it got out of the ship with the help of humans only to be living afterwards in a huge slum area called District 9. One human working for the MNU (multinational united), which is an organizaiton responsible for communicating with aliens, gets infected by an alien substance that causes his body to gradually transform into an alien being. By that happening to him, he is the only human being able to operate on the aliens weapons and machines, and therefore became a  target for all human organizations and companies interested in learning alien technology. He became their target, at all costs.

This movie is different in the sense that it makes you side with the aliens against humans. You see the world through their eyes.
You also see that they are so fragile and weak without their technology, like humans.

3981948,5,B002SJIO5O,"My initial reaction to the segregation trailers of District Nine was a resigned sigh. Here we go, I thought. Another cheezy movie with one gimmick and a bunch of special effects to carry it through the cinemas.

I couldn't have been more wrong.

D-9 is a film of surprising depth, particularily in character development, something not seen often in modern movies. I don't think I've ever seen a film where I have throughly disliked the main character, only to find that by the conclusion I'm completely engrossed in their fate.

In case my first paragraph was misleading, there still are wicked graphics in this film. The film even includes a gravity gun, perhaps a gamer nod to the fact Peter Jackson (producer) ended up working on D-9 instead of the Halo movie.

The only criticisms I have of this film is that, although excellent at establishing the setting the documentry style intro is drags out too long. Also the main badguy is a little too one-dimensional and spends the film stating just how much of a dick he is: ""I love killing prawns."" ""I'm just going to kill you.""

3981950,4,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 (Neil Blomkamp, 2009)

There is heavy-handed, and then there is District 9, a movie that goes so far over that line it's not even funny. Worse, the second half of the movie devolves into the most predictable buddy-cop flick you've ever seen, despite the fact that neither of the buddies involved is a cop. So given all this, why on Earth did I love this movie as much as I did? Part of it, of course, is the phenomenal effects work (the same reason I get so much enjoyment out of the even stupider Alien vs. Predator), but there's something more to it, and that something is Sharlto Copley, a South African actor making his feature film debut, and who manages to outshine everyone else in this cast.

Quick synopsis: aliens came to earth twenty years ago, choosing to land in South Africa, of all places. The government immediately set them up in a section of the city that rapidly became a slum, District 9. The human natives of Johannesburg are restless, and the government has come up with a solution to pacify them: move the aliens, derogatorily known as ""prawns"", to District 10, two hundred fifty kilometers north of the city, and thus two hundred fifty kilometers farther away from humans. Wikus van de Merwe (Copley), a bungling but likable bureaucrat who happens to the the son-in-law of the director of the company that runs alien affairs, is put in charge of serving eviction notices. Things rapidly get out of hand, due not only to the inherent racism on both sides, but because there really are some things going on in District 9 that the humans should probably have been wary of. At the core of those things is Christopher (no actor; the aliens are entirely CGI), an alien who just wants to repair their spaceship and go back to their home planet. Wikus and Christopher start off in a weird kind of colorless antipathy, but after a horrible accident causes Wikus to be shunned by the human population and smeared in the media, Wikus and Christopher find a need to work together to get what each is looking for.

What really makes it work, despite the transparency of everything, is Blomkamp and Tatchell's layers of understanding of innate racism. Underneath the painfully obvious exterior and the reactions of the outright racists is the sort of everyday prejudice rampant in the world today, and often not considered as prejudice. More to the point, the screenwriters don't try to pull their punches at the end and offer some sort of facile new-age ""can't we all just get along?"" mumbo-jumbo. (Come on, you know that would have happened in America.) Copley is able to pull off everything asked of him, both in this regard and in the wider role of reluctant action hero, and that's a pretty amazing thing for a first-time actor. He brings a fine sense of nuance to the role that really allows us to empathize with Wikus, as much as that empathy might make us feel uncomfortable at times.

And the effects! Forget the explosions and big aerial shots of Johannesburg and all that sort of thing and just look at the aliens. Who aren't really there. There's no guy in a rubber suit being augmented by CGI applications here and there; everything you see is CGI. That's an absolute boatload of work, and messing up any single frame could have done the illusion in. Doesn't happen. This is masterful work, certainly the equal of anything done by the top animation studios found in America or Japan, and it's magical. That alone is reason enough to see the movie. (Oh, yeah, and a lot of things blow up.)

So, yes, it does have flaws, and it's certainly not the second coming of Star Wars that so many have proclaimed it to be, but is it enjoyable and worth seeing? Without doubt. *** ",1259539200,24,3703,4.628614916286149

Yes, yes, I know all that, I just wanna be entertained- that theme's been done, then done again, then again ..ad nauseum. I was thinking the only way to save the plot line was to have the aliens relocated to Chicago as new Obama voters. Then I was pleasantly  surprised.

So what does save this movie and transcends it beyond the predictable racism-is-bad, apartheid-is-bad ""message"", what saves it is that ultimately it doesn't take itself seriously, at which point the movie becomes immensely entertaining. The matter of fact story telling absorbs the viewer to accept the premise despite one's common sense. Looking like something I ate at last summer's clambake, the alien CGI is nearly flawless.

Best of all, the witty screenplay has such wry humor that it leaves nothing and no one unscathed. From the Afrikaner elites, to the S.A. Blacks ( who, themselves victims of cruel apartheid, display the same sentiments to these new arrivals), to the aliens themselves portrayed more like insects with a gusto for cat food and tires, advanced technology notwithstanding. Not to mention the proverbial military-industrial complex (always a good villain). Even political correctness is mocked as we follow that dolt of a protagonist's rise via nepotism to a position of authority. His adventures inspecting the District is a rich example of irony as mockumentary.

Of course the tired apartheid-alien message continues throughout the movie: segregated slums, Nazi inspired experiments, sham laws, forced mass evacuations, one from the ""majority"" transforming into one of the ""minority"".  But as the movie progresses this theme becomes so cliche that it barely rises to consciousness and renders it meaningless. And that is a good thing. There's a world of serious cinema dealing with that subject more worthy to explore than a movie such as this. At best, maybe use it as a teaching tool on your middle-schooler about the lessons of apartheid.

3981959,5,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is a refreshing break from the slew of mediocre big-budget sci-fi action flicks produced by Hollywood every year. Made on a tiny budget of $30 million by South African director Neill Blomkamp, it's amazing what he and his crew have been able to accomplish for so little money (comparatively speaking). The story is tightly woven and wonderfully acted by Sharlto Copley, a South African actor who plays the protagonist, Wikus van de Merwe. Blomkamp knows that the story drives a film, not the CG. The CG aids the storytelling, but shouldn't take center stage, something that many of the $150+ million Hollywood CG stinkers forget (ahem...&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/G-I-Joe-The-Rise-of-Cobra/dp/B002NXSRX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">G.I.

In D9, the CG (provided by Vancouver-based SFX house Image Engine) is perfectly blended into the environments and feels natural and realistic. It never sticks out or takes you out of the sense of immersion.

The story is about an alien ship that came to Earth 20 years ago and stopped over Johannesburg, South Africa. There it stayed motionless until the government sent in cutters to open up the ship, where they found a race of cricket-like beings huddled in squalid conditions. Leaderless, malnourished, and numbering over one million, they are given refuge on Earth and confined to slums on the outskirts of the city. Rife with crime, poverty, and violence, District 9 is policed by a private military contractor called MNU (Multinational United) and controlled by a profiteering Nigerian warlord/illegal arms dealer and his thugs. At the beginning of the film, Wikus, whose doofy appearance and demeanor is reminiscent of a young&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Sellers/dp/B0009IW8OE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Sellers</a>, is tasked with evicting the alien residents of District 9 and relocating them to another settlement. During a search for contraband, without giving away too much of the plot, Wikus makes a discovery that changes his life, turning him from an MNU agent into a reluctant hero.

Visually, the film has a very coarse look. As widely publicized, the story is based on South Africa's struggle with apartheid, and was filmed in an actual township in Soweto to give the film a dirty and gritty sense of authenticity, using handheld Red digital cameras to heighten the documentary feel. The story is smartly written and the themes of corporate greed, racism/xenophobia, poverty, and corruption are not hard to believe. Replace the alien refugees with humans and you can find this kind of squalor in many parts of the developing world, like we saw in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slumdog-Millionaire/dp/B001P9KR94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slumdog Millionaire</a>&nbsp;(India) or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-of-God/dp/B0000D9PNX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City of God</a>&nbsp;(Brazil). Crime in South Africa is rampant and it's one of the most dangerous places on Earth in real life. Some of the alien weaponry is very cool and people explode like watermelons. Limbs get severed and there is a good amount of violence and gore in the film, so be forewarned if you are sensitive to such imagery. The climactic showdown at the end is also very exciting and well done.

Stated influences for the film include the Alien and Terminator series, Robocop, Predator, and others, so if you enjoyed these films, you'll probably enjoy D9. Highly recommended for the sci-fi fan.",1258502400,13,3850,6.192523364485981

""District 9"" isn't a movie about aliens from outer space, though it does feature them.  It is a movie about xenophobia, Apartheid, corporate greed, and other real-life issues.

""District 9"" is a movie directed toward your social conscience and, in the end, your heart.  If you only see it as just another shoot-'em-up, blow-'em-up action film, then you are missing the point.  You may enjoy it for those elements too, but if you enjoy it JUST for those elements, then you probably need to learn a little bit more about the world around you to take this film in its proper social context.

******  December 23 addendum *********

The Blu-Ray contains many bonus features, but not all of them are easy to see/read.  There are ""MNU Files"" on the aliens and the District 9 project, but the font is so small in the detail work that you can't really read them unless you put your face right up to the television.  If my Blu-ray player had a ""Zoom"" feature like my regular DVD player then I could manage, but it does not.

Also, the subtitles are in white and superimposed on the film image itself.  That makes them hard to read sometimes.  Had they been in yellow they might be easier to read.  In the days before 16:9 TV sets, everyone watching a letterboxed film had black bars at top and bottom of screen, and those were where the subtitles usually were.  Less black bar space with 16:9 sets.",1258416000,5,1779,4.455108359133127

Now that I have had some time to think about the subject, I am not quite as excited about it, but still thouroughly impressed.

This movie is not your classic sci-fi. It is more of a political movie with some aspects of exploring the human mind, and there are aliens too, so why not try to explore their minds as well? There is absolutely NO comparison to movies like serenity, which is more of your classic story with introductions, climaxes, and resolutions, so it might take a little getting used to if thats what you are expecting.

Many people rated it low because of language, adult themes, gore, shakey camera etc. I was actually suprised to realize that none of it really bothered me. I think that the main reason is that most of it was relevant for the image the director was trying to portray (except, perhaps, one or two exploding humans). Additionally, this movie made no attempt to glorify any of it, just point out how weird people can be especially when they are placed in crappy situations. I don't entirely agree with the opinions presented in the movie, but did not find any of the views presented to outlandish (people can be very gross and mean, its sad, but true). I think this movie was supposed to be a realistic (for lack of a better word, perhaps pessimistic realism would work better) sci-fi, which dosn't happen very often in hollywood, so I commend the effort.

I did not think that any of the characters were underdeveloped. But I could see how some people could think that, because the movie did not go out of the way to explain the characters, you just sort of have to figure it out. I thought the acting was good enough that I was able to watch the characters think and evolve without feeling like any particular behavior was out of place (even of the aliens).",1258156800,4,1902,4.520348837209302

But that is not the case. Indeed the movie does start out as a kind of documentary. But the shaky camera is a welcome absence. The movie then quickly evolves into a well shot, well acted, thoroughly enjoyable action/sci fi film.

Copley plays a bureaucrat tasked with relocating the colony of stranded aliens. This ""colony"", that's actually more like a slum, is discriminated against and the aliens don't get much better treatment than if they were in a concentration camp. So it is Wikus Van De Merwe (played excellently by Copley) who must politically persuade the aliens to ""peacefully"" agree to move to a new camping ground. Yeah...good luck.

When I went to see this I fully expected it to be a typical sci-fi movie about man vs. an alien invasion with special effects being the dominating trait. And usually one can then only hope it has a good story too. And, in fact, this movie does live up to all those qualifiers. But it turns out to be much, much more.

This IS a story about an alien 'invasion', but only in the sense that a group of sick aliens need to have a place to live, so they are intruding on our space and economy. It shows how when any group that share a bond are forced to live geographically together in poverty, that gangs become the norm. This makes sense, since it truly is a(t first) just a step towards organizing to make productivity of the group increase due to the more efficient nature of organizaton. But then it gets out of hand due to power struggles and greed. Weapons become very important.

As such, they have, amazingly, been able to represent at least three different existing real-life 'factions' in one alien race. Apartheid is the most obvious and blantant, especially when you consider the geographic location the majority of the movie takes place in. I've already mentioned gangs. And finally, there are the homeless. When the officials early on are evicting aliens, the absurdity of how we deal with homeless people is made crystal clear. It is common to tell them they can't stay 'here', when obviously their only alternative is to find another 'here' they will eventually be asked to move on from. Aliens make it clear such people have no way to get home. They are truly homeless (short of the goal of the movie to reactivate their ship).

Also, it is a very sfx dominated movie. But in the very best way. They spent most of their effort on making the aliens real, and it definitely works. Christopher is, in my humble opinion, THE best CGI character in any film ever. Yes, I know they use live actors to act as placeholders, but the end result is pure CGI in that nothing visual of the actors remain in the final cut.

It is NOT your typical sci-fi, but has some typical elements. It is much more sophisticated than most of what is out there. This movie proves sci-fi can have great depth and still maintain all the things we tend to love in such movies (e.g., action sequences). It has a very obvious message. Though it gives no solution, it is merely observational. But this is fair, if a movie could solve such world problems, then the world problems would not exist to make the movie about!

In that sense, this movie is more like 'Bladerunner' than it is 'Alienation', the one it seems to be compared to the most. The story is more of a vehicle to let us observe the conditions of District 9. Both D9 and 'Alienation' do have the same premise, but that's it. They both are about the derelicts of an alien race being dumped on the doorstep of a sympathetic people, and the conflicts this can cause when the honeymoon is over. But beyond that, they are completely different. There is no 'master race'. No 'drug' that slaves are given. But more to the point, 'Alienation's message is 'don't do drugs', while D9's message is 'the world has prejudice and stereotyping issues that seriously need to be dealt with'.

I knew almost from the beginning this movie was going to be special. The documentary approach they took was a great way to give us the info we need, and remain constantly entertaining. The way they mixed documentary-like footage with typical movie production scenes was done wonderfully. Like I said, it keeps us more involved, since we tend to enjoy change over monotany. The integration of the aliens into the movie is virtually seamless. Except for the fact we know these aliens and their spaceship and technology can't actually exist, it doesn't take long before one forgets they aren't real. While this movie has a lot of elements that many people might find offensive (e.g., parents), the gore and language and violence is actually used quite appropriately. That all this was done for a significantly lower budget than your typical sci-fi sfx movie is cause for one big 'bravo!'.

I will end with my favorite aspect of the movie. The guy who played the protagonist did an AMAZING job! Especially considering this was the first time he ever acted (except for a short film done to sell the D9 concept). He was just suppose to be a producer on the film! His ability to go from the nerd-like personality he had in the beginning, and then show how self-preservation always dominates as an instinct, was almost seamlessly.

Personally, I'd put this movie up for best picture and best actor. And if it existed, best CGI character. It should still win some awards We'll see!

The movie does have a point that makes a sequel almost a must, and I can't wait to see it if this becomes a reality!",1257206400,7,4824,4.566473988439307
3981968,2,B002SJIO5O,"I had been hearing positive things about this movie for the whole week prior to going to see this, things like ""The best sci-fi movie since Bladerunner"" and ""amazing story with great looking scenes"". To these things I have only one thing to say ""HaHaHaaaaaaa""! If ever the term over-hyped can be used this would be a good place to start. I'd be lying if I said it didn't have it's moments, but getting there wasn't really worth it. I'm probably just not in sync with most of the world at this point in my life, G.I. Joe wich I had a fun time watching is getting trashed but this movie which I will probably never see again is being praised.

  The story is done documetary-style which right there might be my problem with it, the only movie done like this that I have liked so far was Cloverfield and even then I feel these kind of movies are only good one time as they lose there realistic feeling for me. So when the movie opens we se a series of interviews that explain what happened twenty years ago when the alien spacecraft landed floating directly above Johannesburg, South Africa. A couple of months after the arrival of the craft the humans decide to cut their way inside, where they find a group of sickly looking alien beings that look like giant bug men. The creatures are referred to as ""Prawns"" which is not a flattering name and referrs to the Parktown Prawn Cricket species. At first these beings are treated and taken care of but eventually get thrown into a single slum like area know as district 9. A private company known as MNU takes over control of District 9. Wikus Van der Merwe played by Sharlto Copley is an employee of MNU and is assigned the task of giving the residents of District 9 24hr. eviction notices as they are being relocated to a new District 10 camp. During the evictions Wikus gets sprayed with some kind of Alien liquid he finds in one of the shacks and becomes sick. Personally Wikus was a total d$ck the whole time doing things such as burning the baby alien eggs for no real reason and tricking the aliens into signing the eviction papers, that I felt no sympathy when he fell ill. The exposure to this liquid changes his DNA and his body starts to transform into that of a Prawn, justice if you ask me. Wikus ends up working with the Prawns he once treated like crap to find a way to cure his body and get them home.

  The best parts of the movie don't occur until the last half hour and by that time I had already made up my mind this movie kind of sucked, however there were some pretty good action sequences in the last part of the movie worth watching, but like alot of movies these days the ending was left open. I'm going to give this movie a 2 out of 5 don't believe the hype, this may be ""The best sci-fi movie of the decade"" to some, but for me I'll save that tag for movies more like the new Star Trek movie, the rest of you can keep this.",1257033600,11,2896,4.275547445255475

3981970,2,B002SJIO5O,"First point, this is a review of the movie only in it's theatrical release. Don't blame me if you're reading this to get a description of the Blu-ray or DVD version. You should know by now that the numbskulls at Amazon throw together all movie reviews into one steaming pile. Speaking of steaming piles... have you seen District 9?

I went to see this movie against my better judgment. Thankfully I didn't pay to see it. Moviegoers were raving about a new terrific science-fiction film. A bad sign! Many critics were jumping on the bandwagon and giving this one too easy a pass with glowing reviews. Another bad sign! My family and friends were recommending this movie to me. Yet another bad sign! As much as I love sci-fi films, especially the intelligent variety, not the blow stuff up variety, District 9 turned out to be a waste of time since not only does it fall into the blow stuff up variety, it puts the audience through that in a most deplorable fashion. It masquerades as an intelligent premise with perhaps even a social conscience, addressing issues like race and apartheid. But apparently all the film really wants to do is turn into a Michael Bay flick and blow stuff up. Yes, the action did look like it belonged in a rapid fire cut-up and hideously edited Michael Bay extravaganza. Michael Bay movies have a lot of sheen and slickness about them and instead District 9 goes for the dirty, grimy, greasy, ugly look but the action and editing style is right out of Transformers.

All the characters are hideous and dehumanized beyond any consideration. I understand you have to have villains in such dopey movies but here everyone is a villain. Just like in real life, right? Ugh. Why is the father-in-law of the main character turned into a cartoon Nazi instantly? Why are the bald-headed goons in this movie all the same? Why are the aliens so reprehensible? Let's not forget the native South Africans who are all insane criminals. There is not a single likable character in this entire cheesy videogame, I mean movie. District 9 continually reminded me of any numbers of recent videogames. The latest Halo, Killzone 2, Resident Evil 5. The action and frenetic camera never stops and there are constantly shootouts throughout the entire running time. I know some people love this kind of entertainment but please watch Michael Bay instead to get your lowlife kicks. Instead of a film showcasing our civilization colliding with another, we get unintelligible action sequences that seem to have been ripped off from some generic first-person shooter!

The CGI in the film is fairly awful but you'd better get used to it as the CGI is showered over this movie's running time wall to wall. The only CGI I liked were long shots of the alien spacecraft. The alien creatures themselves are the most derivative design one could possibly come up with. Basically huge bipedal cockroaches with disagreeable manners. This is director Neill Blomkamp's first feature film and it shows on many levels. He has no idea how to direct a compelling narrative, work with actors or orchestrate an action sequence. This film is a total mess. It did make a significant amount of money seeing as how mainstream moviegoers will feed at the trough of slimy entertainment. The budget was $30 million and it made $115 million in domestic grosses, so be on the look out for an annoying cash in sequel. This kind of sleazy, badly put together entertainment is merely the norm nowadays and not the interesting premise, nor the name of Peter Jackson as executive producer can save this CGI laden gimmicky mess. It's still not as heinous as the usual Michael Bay flick but mainstream audiences gobble up that dreck with even more glee. Transformers 2 amassed $400 million in domestic grosses alone! Take that, you stupid people who actually care about cinema as an artform! Garbage rules. Garbage served up hot and fresh is what the people, ( mindless prawns ), want and delight in. I still have hope that good science-fiction films are possible even in today's gutter movie culture. This was a missed opportunity by all involved.",1256774400,11,4113,4.806497175141243
3981971,2,B002SJIO5O,I don't understand why this has so many positive reviews. This movie is so bad i could not finish it. Thats saying alot because i sat all the way threw Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. There are no big name actors in this movie. I'm not saying you need a Will Smith or Tom Cruise but maybe it would have helped. These actors seem like complete amateurs. The main character is this realy boring little man. I read a 5 star review that admitted that the main  character was very hard to like. If you believe that then why would you give it 5 stars?  Even the aliens don't seem very intriguing. I gave it 2 stars because it does try to tell a decent story. It just fails everytime that it tries. Watch this at the risk of being bored out of your mind!,1256774400,6,743,4.152777777777778

3981973,5,B002SJIO5O,"I hate when reviews turn into wars between two different kinds of customer.

This is an excellent movie - but it is not a standard sci-fi blockbuster. If you liked Independence Day or Aliens /and/ you want more of the action and 'freaky evil aliens' themes of those movies, District 9 will be a one star experience, even a zero star experience for you.

If you don't know where South Africa is, or what 'Apartheid' is, it will also be a confusing experience.

No rush to judgement, there are plenty of good movies that you can watch without needing to enjoy a weird alien-filled allegory about how humans treat each other. Because that's what District 9 is, it's first and foremost about humans and how we treat each other. Like some of the best thoughtful science fiction out there, it uses the aliens as an allegorical vehicle to describe the way our world is, and how badly we treat each other sometimes. It's not always fun to watch, there are sometimes pacing issues, but all in all, an excellent movie for a certain kind of audience.

ALSO: Can we please get spoiler warnings?? Or a way to tag the reviews of others that are spoiler-filled? I find it offensive when someone drops a one star review on a movie, but essentially gives away the whole movie. Be kind, its possible to explain why you hated something without ruining it for others who may enjoy it.",1256688000,2,1364,4.555102040816327
3981974,5,B002SJIO5O,"Most obviously, District 9 presents an effects-fest as good as any on the screen these days. The aliens, referred to as ""prawns"" in a derogatory slur, are clearly not just people in rubber suits - they're built, they move, and they speak in utterly unhuman ways. They also act on unhuman motives, for unhuman reasons. The disaster that leaves them as refugees on Earth appears to have no equivalent in human psychology or biology. Still, they come to life as thinking, feeling, and caring people of a sort. The directorial alchemy that brings these beings to life really drives this movie, by making us want to suspend disbelief while the story plays out.

Plenty of hard reality helps carry us along, too. It might be a bit heavy-handed that this parable on racism takes place in the country that institutionalized apartheid. I'll take that as a placeholder, though, one that represents any country that has or has had its own tensions between different groups - in other words, just about anywhere. This creates a cinematic lab in which the many cruelties of forced segregation can be examined.

The central character, Wikus, acts as the focus of this study. Cynical leaders set this simple-minded character up as the public face of the atrocities. Wikus, with puppy-like loyalty and eagerness to please, sees only the TV-star glory of the role. He willingly blinds himself to the policies of hatred, even genocide that he emcees for the viewing public. The most wrenching example might be when the relocation forces burn out an alien nursery, and Wikus cheerfully narrates the sounds of their eggs bursting in the flames: ""like popcorn, pop-pop-pop!"" This ability to dehumanize the subjugated people (alien people, but people) has appeared again and again in the worst chapters of human history, and appears with wrenching vapidity in Wikus.

Then, when Wikus finds himself on the other side of the color line, he becomes one of the un-people. He becomes material for sadistic medical experimentation, just one more component to be bolted into the oppressor's war machine. For all this, the movie's creators never forget their duty to the summer-cinema audience. Spectacular effects, bam-pow action, chases, and explosions keep the popcorn crowd happy, at the same time that it satisfies the thinking viewers. This movie's brilliance is that it addresses the viewers who want both.

3981975,5,B002SJIO5O,"This movie I regard as brilliant, and yet I cannot give an unequivocal recommendation to any one of my friends. Why? Well it breaks all kinds of barriers, including some that many people hate to have broken. It depicts a wide variety of horrors, some of which are:

1) Several scenes of extreme violence, including edged instruments to remove parts of a living body.
2) There is a clear theme of racism, comparable to Hitler against Jew and Gypsy prisoners, comparable to South Africa in apartheid years against blacks (but it is rather witty that S.A. black citizens are now with the oppressors).
3) Are you squeamish about a scene depicting ritual cannibalism? It's in there.
4) Are you squeamish about the F-word? It's used dozens of times in several languages.
5) Are you squeamish about all the Nigerians in the film being violent thug warlord/robber types? We know Nigerians are not all like that, but the film knows we know and does not bother to be ""fair and balanced"".
6) Want to see a scene of abortion on an alien? It's in there.

That is a fair list of the type of thing that might spell ""deal killer"" for intelligent adults, and legitimately so. But if you can conceive that such scenes might be used in a smart film, and are willing to give it a try, then you really should. I thought it brought together a bunch of themes from The Twilight Zone, from Cronenberg horror films, from left/right political thinking, and yes even from the best of shoot-em-up alien movies. To my thinking this has been the best movie I've seen all year.",1256256000,7,1546,4.5978260869565215
3981976,5,B002SJIO5O,"This is a testament that shows with a low budget, no major Hollywood backing, a movie can be made that has the power in story telling, character development, and action. I believe this film was budgeted at 30 million? That is what I had read. Peter Jackson was going to have this new comer Neil Blomkamp direct the Halo movie then that fell apart, he felt bad and basically told this young maverick I'll back your next movie... low and behold we have District 9.

I couldn't believe the production values here, if this movie were made for 30 million, it looked like 100 million on film, top notch special effects, no name actors, a great story that pulls in the viewer, and the Aliens, giving them almost a Human element. So the film starts off with an alien race stranded in Johannesburg South Africa for like 30 something years, where the Aliens known as Prawns are herded into these slums and kept under a watchful eye of the MNU, a UN type agency. Then there is the protagonist named Wikus who at the beginning of the film, you get a sense he's a man way over his head, but yet a nice guy, never associate him to be the hero type but your average Joe. He get's a promotion at the MNU (MultiNational United) Wikus is a man who just follows orders, kinda nerdy, xenophobic, has a fear of the unknown, maybe too ambitious, selfish, conniving, his job is to relocate the  Prawns to a new location away from human population, being more isolated from human contact. Wikus is a character the audience would balk at... In the film we see him going around District 9 evicting the Prawns using intimidation, force, lies, one particluar scene he discovers a shack with dead cow carcasses and prawn eggs, which is illegal to have. So he demonstrates an abortion and he doesn't feel sorry, he doesn't view the prawns as an equal. So Wikus doesn't think twice as he kills the prawn eggs, and they torch the shack and hear the eggs popping and he casually says, ""You hear that, that popping? It's the eggs, sounds like popcorn"" one would argue he is just doing his job for the MNU.  BUT then as the film progresses Wikus is being hunted by the same Company he worked for. He holds the key to what the MNU really want from the Prawns---- their futuristic weapons. I think it is believable that any Nation who would come in contact with another race and they had the technology and advanced weaponary we would want it. Let's face it, Humans have been at war for 1,000s of years, it's a natural order, of course a Government would want to harness that power and use it on their enemies and show who is the Super Power. Anyways Wikus still seems manipulative, conniving as he transforms, his DNA bonding with Alien DNA thus metamorphosing into a Prawn, and his only hope is the Prawn Christopher. I think we would all do the same thing if we were in Wkius' shoes. He's desperate, scared and really just thinking about himself and how to turn back to human again. What drives him is the fear of the unknown.

Then there is Christopher the alien Prawn who has found a power source that can ultimately send his race home--- what they had always wanted to do in the first place. Ironically it is Christopher even though being ""alien"" has human traits, has emotions. He wants to help Wikus. There is a nice scene in MNU headquarters where Christopher finds out what really is happening to his race, they are being dissected, tested on, being used essentially as guinea pigs. Wikus never knew that this is happening, it's MNU's dirty little secret being kept under wraps. Wikus realizes the Prawns never meant no harm, they ultimately didn't do anything to the Humans, it was the MNU cleverly disguising their real intentions in the form of supposedly Humanitarian efforts. One scene Wikus tells Chris and his young Prawn that the reolcation spot would be worse that District 9.

The last 30 mins or so is astounding not just visually with the special effects but the action sequences. There is one scene where Wikus who towards the end runs away and we as the viewer feel a sense of anger maybe because he Leaves Chris to his fate which is certainly death but then Wikus comes back.... his ultimate redemption. He Realizes his fate is sealed and he must live with it now and that it's not about him, and ultimately finds sacrifice, he wants to help Christopher get to the mother ship, ultimately Wikus knowing that it's the right thing to do.

 This is what drew me into this film, the humanity, it wasn't just mindless action, if you want that go see Transformers II. I think we know that under the surface there is the allegory of Apartheid in which happened in South Africa, The War on Terror, the War in Iraq happening now. All cleverly disguised in a Sci/Fi movie.

It isn't made for the kiddies, it's rather violent at times, down right gory at others, and actually makes you think about humanity.  The movie isn't about aliens. It's about Apartheid, and instead of blacks and whites in South Africa, it has a different race completely. The director, Neill Blomkamp grew up in South Africa and understands how to make this story work. So, instead of blacks being mistreated by whites, we have an alien ship composed of the (for lack of a better term) working class portion of the race that is fairly docile and prone to following directions.  Throw in the social commentary and some thought provoking images of how poorly we would probably treat these visitors, with a little bit of Dr Mengale, and it makes for an outstanding and truly intense movie rarely delivered these days.  There is no Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie, in fact, there isn't anybody most people in the States would recognize, but they all deliver an outstanding performance within a fantastic plot.  If you thrive on the types of movies with idiotic violence, no real story, characters with no emotion/ acting ability/ or development, then go watch the Transformers series and clean the drool from your shirt and attempt to recover your hearing at the door.

3981982,5,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 makes no apologies for being a straight-forward heavy-handed allegory for South African apartheid, hence the probability of a malfunctioning extraterrestrial mothership that just so happens to appear hovering in the skies over Johannesburg of all places on Earth and marooning a non-human race of aliens which are quickly given the derogatory slur ""Prawn"" because of their resemblance in appearance to our planet's indigenous crustaceans and are quickly ""relocated"" from District 9's shantytowns and slums as history begins to inevitably repeat itself. The film starts off as a mockumentary with realistic brilliance and abruptly shifts gears toward a conventional plot-driven science fiction story that recalls sociological themes of racial prejudice explored in past science fiction films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Nation/dp/B000059HAD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Nation</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enemy-Mine/dp/B000059HAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enemy Mine</a>. There really aren't any likable humans in this film at all, not even the ""anti-hero"" Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) who comes off as a complete bureaucratic tool only interested in (literally) saving his own skin... and that's really the whole point, isn't it? That from the alien's point-of-view their impression of the human race is one of a predominately vile, greedy, despicably self-serving species whose ulterior motive is profiting from the knowledge and technological ""acquisitions"" that contact with an advanced alien race might bring us and the consequences when first contact goes horribly awry and Director Neill Blomkamp explores these shameful and seemingly unredemptive human character flaws with profound existential brilliance.

The ""Prawns"" are the most ""Alien"" looking aliens in cinema this side of H.R. Giger's Alien or Stan Winston's Predator and refreshingly features some of the best use of seamlessly integrated CGI seen in cinema in recent years. The more inhuman they appear only reinforces our irrational fears and anxieties to their seemingly non-hostile intentions and our tendencies towards racial animosity. They communicate to us only through a strange audible clicking sound that constitutes their linguistic structure similar to the native South African Bantu and the apparent semantic language differences, cultural customs and communication barriers rapidly deteriorate any hope for peaceful coexistence between our species. For example, the Prawns don't understand legal jargon like ""eviction"" making their ignorance to our common laws easy targets for bureaucratic exploitation and authoritarian subjugation.

It would be interesting to see if the Prawn who identifies himself only as Christopher Johnson would keep his promise to Wikus. After all the deplorable things we did to his kind though why should he? Perhaps that is what ultimately separates them from us and in spite of his race being atrociously segregated, brutally tortured and inhumanely experimented on comes back in three years to District 10 to free his people and help poor Wikus out of moral sympathy and compassion, universal traits that are seemingly lost upon the native human inhabitants of this planet.",1255996800,22,3327,6.15268817204301

Cameras following one person and this person talking to audience. There you have it. Now, include some liberal politics and agenda into this mix, you have district 9!!!
An alien ship comes and parks over Nigeria. It turns out bug like aliens, their ship broke and they need refuge. They are placed in an isolated camp!!! called district 9. And many humans do not want them there, but socialist government( you will discover this as you watch) wishes to offer eaual opportunity to these aliens. So, plans are drawn to move aliens from district 9 to another location but this move CANNOT be done, unless aliens agree and sign moving documents!!!! A group of government employees are assigned to go in district 9 and get aliens sign these documents. Mind you that all these are happening in reality show style. During this operation, lead person( same guy is talking to cameras), finds a can of liquid and this liquid sprays on his face. This starts a genetic mutation on this guy. I can't even type this, soo bad...Well, as this guy slowly becoming an alien, plot thickens and he befriends with another alien who is trying to fix their broken ship and go home. Meanwhile, government is very much interested in this guys mutation into alien from human form. So, they are after him, while he is trying to help this one alien to fix his ship. Aliens has superior weapons and huge fire power. Easily they can over power humans but no alien ever touches any gun. Some reason, they are extremely peaceful, yet have those deadly weapons!!!!, our guy, who is muating into alien can now use alien weapons since these weapons bio-genetically locked. Anotherwords, you must be alien to use them. Again, some reason, our mutant boy is also hesitant to use these weapons against anyone. he cries alot, becauase his feelings get hurt and he is in distress when he faces crisses. Take my word for it, RENT IT first from redbox for a dollar to see if you like it. Horrible movie....By the way, at the end, he turns into full alien and the only alien who he help to fix the huge ship rest of the aliens came in. This alien fixes the ship and takes off. He does NOT take any other alien with him. And remaining aliens moves into another camp, their number increases in a decade form 200K to 2.5 million.",1255910400,8,2458,4.588636363636364

They seem to randomly start in the middle of the story, go really nowhere, then end the film. I just don't get it. Are we supposed to simpatize with the aliens while they are ripping off the limbs of humans, making weapons, and turning humans into aliens? Was that the point? Are we supposed to cheer that one alien was able to leave on a ship that carried tens of thousands, stranding the rest here?

3981986,5,B002SJIO5O,"It's rare at the moment to see a science fiction movie that isn't a remake, a cash-in, an adaptation, or a spinoff of another big success.

But ""District 9"" is not that kind of movie. Instead, the rarest kind of film -- a unique and original idea, handled in an intelligent manner, with no big name actors or flashy special effects. Director Neill Blomkamp instead creates a truly captivating sci-fi movie -- and by inverting the whole alien-invasion trope, Blomkamp also forces his audience to think. Hard.

Almost thirty years ago, an alien ship appeared over South Africa -- but it brought neither global destruction or salvation. When soldiers cut their way in, they found starving refugees who are now nicknamed ""prawns.""

Currently the aliens live as outcasts in District 9 while nations argue over them, and the company Multi-National United is selected to make their weapons work... which is not possible, because only alien DNA can activate them. Then during forced evictions of District 9, a typically callous MNU field operative named Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) accidently sprays himself with a black alien fluid in a little lab. Unfortunately, it starts turning him into one of the aliens.

Unsurprisingly, the MNU wants the secrets of Wikus' changing body, and the corporation is not terribly picky about how they get it. He manages to escape into the only place where he has a chance of surviving -- the very alien slum that he was trying to empty, District 9. And his only chance of surviving and becoming human again lies with an alien scientist who is trying to reactive the hovering ""prawn"" mothership.

Segregation. Blatant discrimination (including a racist nickname). Poverty. Shanty towns. Large companies and countries who care nothing for the despised minority population. It's painfully clear what would probably happen if spooky insectile aliens were to land on humanity's doorstep -- and Neill Blomkamp pulls no punches in his allegorical examination of apartheid, alien-style -- with the poor ""prawns"" as the universal victims. It's a hard, gruesome story with painfully graphic violence (Wikus gleefully bombs alien eggs) but it really needs to be that way.

Blomkamp also presents his story in a unique way -- much of it is filmed like a documentary, though thankfully it has none of the sickmaking shakiness of movies like ""Cloverfield"" or ""The Blair Witch Project."" There are plenty of spliced interviews, documentaries and news footage, which are cloaked in a feeling of gritty, dusty realism -- the dark industrial mothership with its slimy interior, the dusty slum, and the poor aliens who basically scavenge through garbage to survive.

But the last quarter of the movie also evolves it into a slam-bang explosion-riddled action flick, without losing its focus -- there are some brilliantly gruesome scenes where the aliens turn against some human attackers, and Wikus even gets to kick butt anime-style in an alien battle-suit. If there's a flaw with this movie, it's the whole idea that humans wouldn't be at all afraid of aliens who are clearly technologically superior to us -- they have a freaking SPACESHIP that's been sitting over Johannesburg for thirty years!

It also has the virtue of the most alien aliens seen in ages -- they move, look, speak (click click!) and think nothing like humans, and they're slimy and kinda creepy looking. They have no grandiose plans or pretty sparkly technology. Yet Blomkamp infuses them with a sense of nobility and strength, and despite their insectile faces he makes you feel what they do after awhile.

It's hard to believe that this is Sharlto Copley's first acting role, because his performance is so strong: Wikus is a pretty despicable human being, who has fun killing aliens and ejecting them from their homes. It takes a physical transformation into an ""other"" to change his spirit as well. And Blomkamp lets us see the pain of his transition even when we don't like him (including a heartrending phone call to his wife). The supporting actors also provide excellent lesser performances, but Copley rules this one.

As for the single-disc DVD... well, it's pretty skimpy, honestly. It will have a director's commentary by Blomkamp, which is pretty much guaranteed to be awesome -- I would love to see how he conjured the aliens and their hovering ship. There's also the ""Koobus Big Gun"" featurette, a three part ""Filmmaker's Log,"" and a sequel log called ""Refining District 9."" The downside: The original short film ""Alive in Joburg"" that this movie stems from is NOT included. I don't know why -- it's certainly short enough to fit.

""District 9"" is a brilliantly original, hard-hitting movie that wraps a timeless human failing in an alien skin. It's one of the best movies of the year thus far, and certainly a classic in the making.",1255392000,9,4836,5.002487562189055

3981988,5,B002SJIO5O,"""District 9"" is a sci-fi movie by description but far more than that.  A word of caution - the R rating is fully deserved - this film is extremely brutal both in graphic images as it is in emotional concepts.  It seems that the only thing that makes it possible to actually show what it shows - i.e. persons pulverized to bloody mush - is the fact that good half of those persons are aliens - and not very likable aliens at that.  They are not really threatening - they are mostly mean, ugly, prone to mindless vandalism degenerates of a race fallen to an unknown calamity.  The movie starts as a fake documentary of sorts - summarizing the alliens' arrival some 20 years ago, subsequent discovery that the visitors are really a pathetic group of physically exhausted and mentally incapacitated survivors huddling on a disabled ship, goverment's efforts to house them on Earth in what quickly becomes a ghetto town, increasing civic hostility toward the uninvited visitors, and the subsequent action to move them all into a new facility - a tent city in the middle of nowhere surrounded by barbed wire.  Enter the main protagonist - dorky  bureaucrat put in charge of this operation.  He is as clueless as he is terrifying - shyly showing the wedding picture of his wife for the camera (""my angel""), and then cheerfully providing a running commentary as shacks containg ready to hatch alien younglings are being incinerated with flame torches by the special forces (the eggs popping from heat sound a lot like popcorn, he says....).  All this is frequently punctuated by testimonials and comments from experts - and provides a very scary view of how media can put an acceptable spin on just about anything in the name of science and reason.
Of course, things do not go as planned - the main character gets inadvertently exposed (mostly due to his rigid assumption of superiority over anything alien) to alien DNA, and starts to evolve into, yes you guessed it - an alien.  Humans betray him, as they all want to kill him and dissect his organs to advance military and medical science.  He is forced to make a leap of faith and turn to the very aliens he abused for a chance of an unlikely alliance.  A lot of very gory scenes, shootings and suspense ensues... See it for yourselves - I will not give out the ending.
The movie is good and chilling to the bone not because of ugly aliens or intergalactic conflict.  Most critics drew parallels with South African apperheid (the ship happens to crush land over Johannesburg) but I think that there is much more to it.  It shows how so many things were made possible:  Hitler, the slave ships, gulags and extermination of half of Asia and Eastern Europe by Stalin, concentration camps, the gradual destruction of Native Americans, what the Conquistadors did to the native peoples of South America, and what Ceasar did to Gallic and German tribes... It shows how easily, when it comes to those different, fear and prejudice can eclipse the need to understand and connect.  How there are people eager to play officials with guns - not for a cause but for the pleasure of seeing those different suffer and die.  How many average people will resort to bestiality to assert their ""normality"".
Watch it at your own risk - it is not pleasant to view but truly extraordinary...",1254700800,,3315,4.689655172413793
3981989,5,B002SJIO5O,"Every once in a BIG while, perhaps only a few of times each decade, that rare film comes completely out of left field to let us know that there are still some original ideas out there, and that cinema can still be fresh and exciting. DISTRICT 9 is just such a film. And how.

Historically, science fiction has been a special genre of choice for socially conscious tales that put our struggles into perspective through fantastical storytelling; The Day the Earth Stood Still did it with nuclear weapons, Planet of the Apes did it with race relations, and now District 9 does it with the topic of refugees. These are the kinds of films born of a storyteller's concern for humanity, and because of that, they resonate beyond our usual selfish childish hopes for sci-fi thrills. Don't get me wrong, I love sci-fi and everything that it implies like, in this case, extreme violence, gore and extraterrestrial paraphernalia. But strong, disturbing, deep drama is essential in any genre.

Compelling, captivating, occasionally hilarious, and refreshingly unpredictable thanks to a smartly structured script that builds impressive momentum, District 9 surprises at every turn while holding a mirror to society in a way that will likely find the film ranking favorably amongst the best of the genre. Perhaps it's a blessing in disguise, but let's not go too far. It has its flaws despite the sheer innovations. In order to give this monumental task the precise and necessary touch of realism and credibility, the documentary style mixed with the straight line real-life focus can be, let's say, uncomfortable. Quick and fuzzy  images proper of the portable camera tend to loose that visual focus, but NEVER the interest despite the slight annoyance. I tell you, nobody will leave their seats, and my suggestion is to buy popcorn and soda in advance, every minute is precious and important.

Going back to this new born masterpiece, let's get to the plot: It's been 28 years since an giant alien spacecraft came to a standstill over the city of Johannesburg, South Africa. After cutting their way into the ship to find a million malnourished extraterrestrials, authorities ushered them down to  and set them up in District 9, a makeshift refugee camp that quickly became a junkyard, replete with crime, vice, and overcrowding. The locals want the aliens gone, and a private firm called MNU (Multi-National United) has been assigned the task of evicting them to what is, essentially, a concentration camp. Heading up this mission is Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a bumbling bureaucrat who essentially serves as a figurehead for MNU, which is more concerned with harnessing the visitors' highly advanced technology and weaponry than looking out for their well-being. While evicting the aliens, referred to as ""prawns"" due to their resemblance to humanoid shrimps, Wikus is inadvertently exposed to their biotechnology, prompting a strange metamorphosis that makes him the most wanted man on the planet.

For me the most remarkable aspect in this movie was the perfect balance between an insightful review of the human condition and the astonishing display of special effects, not to mention the constant wild speculation. Director Neil Blomkamp  never lets  one to go on top of the other, and just when we're starting to hope for a mood switch ...BOOOM! There comes the old fashioned in-your-face sci-fi action. Things never start to get grim anyhow, and the real thrill is guessing where the story goes. But in order to project a full quality product, I must say the movie smartly satisfies our needs by disarming humor and blowing us from our seats. The south african underground guerrilla atmosphere is just perfect, and I totally agree with the extreme polarization of the characters, making it more digestible with effortless efficiency.

The creature and tech design may not exactly escape the regular standards, but makes perfect sense because its not the main issue here. I mean come on, sci-fi design is not going through an enlightenment period these days. Besides, we obtain way more than we can possibly expect, if artful realism is indeed the goal here. But like i said, the faults of the visual style combined with a subjective vision of traditional narrative may disturb. It makes you wonder about the Blu-ray version of this film.

My strongest recommendations for sci-fi artists and movie lovers in general. A solid four and a half for this turning point of the genre in this early century.",1254614400,28,4502,5.030872483221477

3981993,3,B002SJIO5O,"See this movie before you buy the DVD.  I love si-fi but was very disappointed with this.  I didn't like the jerky ""documentary"" style of filming.  It doesn't work as a metaphor for racial injustice because the aliens really are sub-human, and the humans aren't very bright either.  The Nigerians are cast as the bad guys who exploit the aliens, so what have we learned?  The racial angle may have more significance for South Africans, but it didn't work for me. The biggest problem with the movie was that there was no character to connect with.  The lead human character reminds me of the ""upper class twits"" in Monty Python sketches.  Again, South Africans may have another take on this but I don't have their context.

The movie is full of logical inconsistencies such as needing to forcable get the aliens to sign a piece of paper before moving them and the fact there there is one super smart alien (and his son).

The idea of aliens showing up and not trying to attack us is intriging, but wasted in this movie.  The only show I remember covering this subject was the movie and TV show Alien Nation.  Bits like an alien openning his door and saying that nobody is home were the best parts of the movie.  The action scenes at the end were good but it was just a shoot'em up.",1253923200,5,1280,4.446351931330472

3981995,3,B002SJIO5O,"As I had mentioned in my review of Moon, the science fiction genre has been going through quite a change the past few years, and it hasn't necessarily been a change for the better. Intelligent scripts, interesting plots and most importantly, coherent story lines are a rarity nowadays in sci-fi films. It seems that big explosions and hot girls are being simply acting as eye candy to distract the audience from the fact that these movies have little to no substance behind them. This is why films like District 9 are a breath of fresh air, as Producer Peter Jackson and Director Neill Blomkamp prove that you can still make a smart and compelling popcorn-flick without having Megan Fox be half naked (not necessarily a bad thing) throughout the whole film or spending millions of dollars on special effects (I'm talking to you Michael Bay).

  The film centers around the event of large alien space craft that has come to earth and halted, hovering over Johannesburg, South Africa. Weapons research company, Multi-National United has taken over the area and has secluded the aliens and their space craft in an area known as ""District 9"".  The movie's strength lies in its ability to take socially and politically relevant issues such as Apartheid and treatment of illegal aliens and apply them to the classic sci-fi concept of extraterrestrials coming to earth and how we interact with them.

  What makes this film unique is that it raises an interesting question about humans having contact with aliens from outer space; what if they're not sadistic, bloodthirsty creatures looking to take over our planet? What if they're just a bunch of relatively mild-mannered, cat-food loving buffoons who don't have a place to go? My first guess would be something involving a reality-TV show (eg. ""So You Think You Can Dance with an Alien?"", or ""Alien Idol""). Realistically, however, one would be hard-pressed to argue against the approach that this film takes. We encounter a life-form who appears to be non-violent and has technology that we don't have, so we exploit them in whatever way possible to learn more about them and how we can use it.

  While being a very good film, what prevented it from being a great film for me was that I felt it dragged a bit in the middle after starting out with a very engaging pseudo-documentary type approach, as well as the choice to use a more comical protagonist, Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), who is shown to not be suit at all to handle the situation he has been put into and not really fit into the intense and dramatic approach this film was taking.  Despite this, District 9 is an original and thought provoking science fiction film that should resonate well with moviegoers this summer.

Grade: 7.5/10

3981996,1,B002SJIO5O,"I'm such a major scifi fan that I even enjoy some B-movie scifi's, so I'm not that hard to please. However this movie was disturbing and dull. There was not one character in the movie that we could care about. The lead character was kind of unlikable and uninteresting. The aliens were repulsive, base and the majority were stupid. The one smart alien was undeveloped as a character, and not very interesting. The human criminals were just as repulsive as the aliens. The rest of the human characters were equally shallow, unlikable and unbelievable.

A good scifi takes you into another reality and lets you believe it for a couple of hours. A good story makes you care about something. This movie did neither of those things. There was plenty of disturbing gore and violence which I would have overlooked if the movie was good, but it wasn't. The word that came to mind for us when we left was ""creepy"". If you're very curious, wait for the DVD rental.",1253404800,29,954,4.6117647058823525
3981997,4,B002SJIO5O,"The start of this film really presented somewhat of a unique challenge for first time feature film director, Neill Blomkamp as it adopted a realistic documentary story telling style for the majority of this bizarre Sci-Fi picture. This was a unique style and for the entire time that was maintained I found myself being utterly enthralled by the whole ordeal. Something went wrong however, and in the last 45 minutes or so, Blomkamp abandoned that cinematographic method for a generic action sequence that, although still successfully told the story, took a lot away from what the first half of the film worked so hard to build up.  The curious but strangely inspired choice of Johannesburg, South Africa as the setting for this film really worked on a lot of levels and as I think more about it, I struggle to really believe if this film could have been set anywhere else and work just as well. Focusing on the main theme of racism, this film has a really powerful message to send and Blomkamp purposely does not try to gloss over the truly harsh nature of the events being depicted in the film.

In 1982 a large alien mother ship was stranded hovering over Johannesburg unable to leave as some suspected the ship had lost its navigation device which was apparently seen falling from the mother ship but was never found. As exploratory team cuts their way into the ship to find a large number of insect-like aliens, malnourished and leaderless they are contained within a government district known as District 9. 20 years later a mass public hostility has grown towards the derogatorily labelled Prawns and a decision is made to move them to a new camp which would be safer for both humans and aliens. A private military contractor called Multinational United (MNU) is brought in by the government to move the now 1.8 million alien population to a new camp, District 10, placed 240 Kilometres outside of Johannesburg. Leading this mass relocation campaign is MNU field operative Wikus Van Der Merwe. During the time of him serving the eviction notices and inspecting the alien huts, he discovers an alien device which sprays dark liquid into his face and infects him with a virus that is slowly transforming him into a prawn. In order to be cured Wikus must team up with a prawn to help get the device back from the MNU and help the aliens return to the mother ship.

Although the character of Wikus has a pivotal part in this film, the triumph of the whole feature is the alien species more affectionately named, Prawns. The creation of New Zealand based Weta Workshop, famous for their work on the Lord of the Rings films, they made the conscious decision to create a creature that we could both be intimidated by and feel sympathy for. A lot of the latter emotion has to do with the eyes of the creature as they are truly the eyes inspired by a puppy dog. The creatures interact and behave exactly the same as humans do in the conditions the aliens have found themselves confined in. It comes across as a film about the third world conditions and the aliens as a metaphoric representation of how we treat things that are ""alien"" to us which I found to be quite an endearing aspect of the film. Wikus is the loveable loser who's faced with a massive obstacle that he really struggles to overcome and that is the largest part of his charm. He's a real person and although he does display a truly despicable side, his redeeming qualities outshine the evil nature we first see.

The setting of Johannesburg, as mentioned before, is a truly inspired choice of setting for such a movie as is the general consensus with alien movies we would usually expect to see them set in some major US city. Johannesburg is a perfect choice to tell such a story as the desolate, detritus landscape of the alien slums is the only real setting that can tell this story and if set in an American city or state, I think this film would have struggled to achieve the same impact. Setting the alien story parallel to the true conditions in which the South Africans live allows for that additional element of terror and sympathy not just for the South African people but for the alien characters also. The gore and language of the film is smattered with 80s and 90s Sci Fi nostalgia, reminiscent of the likes of Robocop and Starship Troopers, which creates a more aggressive feel to the atmospheric tone of the film.

Out of everything in this film that can be both praised and condemned the overall film works superbly to allow for one very enjoyable experience. Being the first major acting job of Sharlto Copley (Wikus), this is without a doubt the stepping stone that will lead onto an immensely successful career for this very talented actor. I won't spoil the end but it is open ended and there is certainly room for a sequel which I hope we will see at some point. I am especially optimistic with the news of Blomkamp expressing interest in creating a sequel. I would say you should really see this film in any way you possibly can as it's genuinely worth your time. It may not be the best film you will ever see in your lifetime, but it will definitely be one that you will have a fondness for.",1253232000,6,5180,4.595675675675675
3981998,5,B002SJIO5O,"I finally seen this a week ago. I am glad I caught it before it left the theater. I cannot believe it cost only 30 Million to create. It sucks you in from start to finish. It seemed like it was over before it started. I can only hope for a sequel in 3 years. Why in 3 years? Watch it and find out why!
The aliens speak their own language, not English. This is a major plus! It seems fake that an alien race would speak English, but how many times has it happened in movie land? Also, the alien effects are the best I have EVER seen. They look amazingly real and move with a unique body language.
The alien weapons are bad, bad, bad ass!
The main character is played by a virtual unknown, at least here in the USA. No one could have done a better job with the role. He carries most of the film on his back and he delivers!
Some reviews complain that there are scenes of graphic violence and language, but there is nothing worse here than anything you have seen before. The action/fighting scenes are ""graphic"", but real-life war is bloody. That's what happens when weapons are involved in fighting. It is R rated also.
Peter Jackson endorsed something that blows away all 3 of his LOTR movies! If you have not seen this, and are a fan of Sci-Fi/Alien movies, this is a must see. The best film I've seen this year, bar none!",1253232000,7,1322,4.208661417322834

If THE DARK KNIGHT brought superhero movies into the real world, DISTRICT 9 brought sci-fi films into the real world. To describe it...it's ALIEN NATION meets BLACK HAWK DOWN (with a little ""V"", ALIEN, INDEPENDENCE DAY, TRANSFORMERS, ENEMY MINE, and WAR OF THE WORLDS thrown into the mix). The film is an allegorcial tale concerning refugees (from another planet) shot partly documentary-style. It is gut-wrenching and not for the squeamish.

3982000,3,B002SJIO5O,"We had not done our research on this movie and merely bought a ticket and went in. We expected a SCIFI (which I like but my wife does not) and from this perspective she was positively surprised and I a bit less. It is really a movie with a story disguised behind SCIFI and action... and as there is quite a bit of this disguise the movie at times seems a bit chaotic and losing its audience.

The underlying story behind clearly is our (mankinds) inability to deal with extreme poverty, refugee's and opposing cultures and values and for highlighting this the team behind the movie should be applauded but it seems at times they got a bit carried away in their 'cover theme' being SCIFI Action scenes. So it ends up being a quite decent action movie (for those who like this) while still being a movie with a message..... It would probably come up a notch if it somehow attempted to raise suggestions for a solution.

3982001,5,B002SJIO5O,"Four years ago, a short 6.5 minute documentary appeared - a criticism of apartheid titled, ""Alive In Joburg.""  However, instead of using apartheid between blacks and whites to illustrate his criticism, the producer chose to demonstrate apartheid between humans and an alien species.  One thing led to another - and this short documentary found its way into the hands of studio execs at Sony/Columbia & TriStar.  They contacted the ""Alive In Joburg"" producer and convinced him to expand this into a full-length feature film (with studio funding).  And, four years later, out came ""District 9.""

I might not have understood the full force of this film had I not recently seen another documentary film - ""The Betrayal"" - showing the life of a Laotian family relocated to New York during the Vietnam war.  In ""District 9,"" and on its face, the lifestyle of the aliens forced to live in slum-like conditions seemed barbaric.  But, it was no different than the lifestyle of the Laotian family forced to live in the slums of New York.

In short, the aliens were no different than humans - reacting similarly to the conditions they were forced to endure in order to survive.  Yet underneath the surface, the aliens were just as ""human"" as their human hosts.  And, it took an incident I won't discuss (a spoiler) to convince the lead protagonist (played brilliantly by Sharlto Copley) that this was the case.  What followed was a physical as well as emotional transformation - and an ending scene that left very few dry eyes in the theater where I saw the film.

It may be science fiction.  But Sharlto Copley deserves an Oscar for his performance.  The film, itself, deserves similar recognition.  It transcends the genre and becomes a testament to the way humans treat each other - and would likely treat a vulnerable alien race.

P.S.  It would not be a spoiler to say that an alien ""mothership"" is seen during the film.  However, in its original incarnation as a short documentary, there were three seen near the end.  Perhaps a ""District 10"" sequel will show us more than a single mothership (grin).  In any event, when the DVD is finally released, I suspect ""Alive In Joburg"" will be an included special feature.  And in watching it, you will see how the germ of a great idea became THE science fiction film of the year.",1252454400,6,2317,4.7425
3982002,4,B002SJIO5O,"""District 9""', the new film from director Neil Blomkamp and producer Peter Jackson (""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) is action packed, filled with great special effects and even has a bit of a message, all things we rarely, if ever, see in a summer blockbuster. But the film is a bit all over the place and this dilutes the power of such an original project. It's a lot of fun to watch, but it meanders a bit too much.

A while back, a huge spaceship entered the atmosphere over Johannesburg, South Africa, basically coming to a stop over the sprawling city. Anxious to find out what was going on, the authorities send some people up to the spaceship and they cut into it, revealing a bunch of aliens who were sick and in need of attention. Their solution is to set them up in a segregated community called District 9. The place quickly becomes a slum and the authorities spend most of their time trying to keep the aliens inside the confines of the District and their crime to a minimum. We get all of this information through a documentary film crew who are giving us a recap. The government has decided to reclaim the district, because they have no more room and the aliens have to go. Wikus Van Der Merwe (Sharlto Copley), the poster boy for the MNU (Multi National United) is awarded the task of providing eviction notices to the 'prawns"" as they are commonly referred to. He is extremely proud and sets off for District 9. Soon, they meet some resistance and Wikus is accidentally exposed to their biotechnology. He begins to sense strange things happening and his body starts to change, taking on some of the appearance of the 'prawns'. Now a fugitive, he eventually decides to hide out amongst the rest of his new people. When he learns some secrets about the MNU, he decides to help one of the alien's resistance leaders fight back against the oppression they have been facing.

""Distrct 9"" came about because Peter Jackson and Neil Blomkamp were going to make a film based on the video game ""Halo"". That was delayed, so they decided to work together to make this film which is based on a short film the director made a number of years earlier. It is an unusual, inventive film and shows great promise for this director. It is easy to see why Jackson was so keen to make this film with the director.

The film is presented as a documentary and opens with a selection of newsreel footage bringing us up to speed. What we quickly learn is that an alien spaceship is sitting above Johannesburg, South Africa and all of the inhabitants have been segregated into a slum called District 9. Shortly after this happens, a piece of the spaceship falls to Earth and the authorities have never been able to find it. Now the government wants the land back and the aliens have to go. Wikus, a clueless government plebe is excited to receive the opportunity to be the face of the eviction effort. If successful, he knows that his career will really take off, this despite the fact his father-in-law is in charge of the MNU. He sets off, complete with a security force, and they make their way to the slum. They quickly run into resistance and Wikus gets separated from his team. He seeks refuge with a male prawn and his young son, but gets exposed to their DNA, causing him to begin to transform. Scared out of his mind, he tries to hide it, to keep away from people, but his secret quickly becomes known and the MNU starts to hunt for him, because he could hold the key to some very important questions they have been trying to answer.

As the film progresses, we watch as Wikus tries to navigate through the various landscapes, both alien and human, adapting to his new life. During these moments, the film leaves the documentary format behind, returning to this narrative style throughout, flowing from one format of the narrative and back again seamlessly.

Sharlto Copley, a native South African, plays Wikus and he does a very good job with the role. A virtual unknown, Blomkamp cast him for his short film and he plays the same character in both films. I was impressed by his work and how well he handles all of the different emotions and situations his character experiences. In the beginning, his hair slicked back, his white button down short sleeve shirt complete with a pen sticking out of the pocket; this guy could not be anything but a bureaucrat. He is filled with fresh-faced optimism at his new position and even excited about the new responsibility. As he goes through his day, and the situation deteriorates, his optimism remains throughout. He never willingly says a bad word about his employer, even when he discovers some shocking secrets about them.

Only when the situation becomes dire, does he truly realize the gravity and danger he is now in. Only then, does he switch his alliance and start looking to new people for help and assistance.

I like the fact it takes a long time for Wikus to change, to see the light. If he starts to doubt the MNU, the people he works for, that means he has to accept that his body has become infected. It also seems completely natural for his character to offer his help to the alien father in return for his help. He has a lifelong bias toward these creatures and that isn't going to change overnight.

The CGI (Computer Generated Imagery or effects) work in the film is truly remarkable. From the moment we first see one of the aliens, they seem real; every movement is flawless, everything they do seems to work. In a way, I think it was a daring decision for Blomkamp and Jackson to create a film about aliens existing in our world. They have to make the creatures seem even more realistic, even more alive, because they are living in a real world, a world we recognize. It would have been a little easier for them to have the aliens living in their world, to make them seem real because they are in a fictional world. Because they would have to create the background for these creatures, they can hide some flaws and movements. In our world, they have to work extra hard to make everything fit, to make them seem real in a real world.

It is also interesting to see the huge spaceship floating above the city in newsreel footage, more so because the footage is from different times and places, the quality changing greatly from one clip to the next. The spaceship appears all the more convincing because in some clips we don't even see all of it. It is that big. Then, when we finally get some close looks at it, it appears menacing and ominous and frightening. But then we remember a key fact. The ship appears to be broken down.

The action is also great. Blomkamp has a real no-holds-barred style and really puts us in the thick of the action. One of the key plot points in the film is the aliens have all of this advanced weaponry with them, weaponry the MNU wants to learn about and get hold of. The corporation captures some weapons, but they only work when operated by the aliens, so they learn little and don't get the results they want. During some of the battles, Wikus gets his hands on some of these weapons and his evolving DNA allows him to use them. And they prove helpful to him, but also frighteningly deadly.

But ""District 9"" is too unwieldy a film. It revisits locations, putting Wikus through the same situations a few times and this only makes the film seem repetitive. For instance, he journeys to MNU twice and has to fight his way out each time.

There are also a few plot points that don't mesh as well as the others. As soon as we learn about the aliens who have been segregated to this slum, we learn about a band of Nigerian gangsters who have opened up a black market with the creatures. The Nigerians want the weapons these creatures have and considering the prawns are willing to trade the weapons for cans of cat food, everyone feels like they have made a deal. When the Nigerians learn of Wikus, and his special new skills, they want him as bad as the MNU and everyone else. So their paraplegic leader sends bands of his men after him.

This storyline just seems extraneous. Quite frankly, the MNU is a more menacing villain, so the Nigerian gangsters seem like time filler.

But ""District 9"" has a lot to offer and a lot of originality we don't often find or experience in a summer blockbuster.

Regarding the cat food... The aliens find they have a taste for the feline staple and willingly trade for cans of the stuff. When everyone learns this, the cat food takes on a new currency in unscrupulous hands.

""District 9"" is definitely worth a look. It is worth your time and money. And see it now, so when ""District 10"" comes out, you aren't scrambling to rent the first film. Or waiting impatiently for Netflix to send it to you.

And I am definitely interested to see what else Neil Blomkamp brings to the silver screen. I get the sense he is someone to watch.",1252368000,4,8861,4.50747198007472
3982003,4,B002SJIO5O,"After viewing District 9 today, I can only conclude that this film is Peter Jackson's attempt at social commentary concerning South Africa's past apartheid system. I say this because of the obvious similarities between the treatment of South Africa's black population and the aliens living in District 9.

During the 1960's to early 1980's, the South African government implemented a policy whereby South African Blacks, Indians, and Coloreds were forced to ""resettle"" into separate homelands. As a result, the government segregated education and public services to name a few. This is no different to what the aliens in District 9 had to endure. Of course, it didn't hurt to have an entire South African population that was, for the most part, xenophobic, which is not surprising because humans in general are ""speciesist.""

The film will, hopefully, force the viewer to question his own beliefs and his sense of morality when it comes to the treatment of other racial groups and how our views should be evaluated and changed, if possible. One only need look at the Native Americans of the United States to see how man's evil against his human brother exemplifies Jackson's critique of South African apartheid. The Native American are considered by sociologist to be living in a ""Fourth World"" within a ""First World"" nation!

Viewers who seek mindless entertainment provided by excessive CGI should look elsewhere for their entertainment. I say this because I've already spoken to a few individuals who fit this type and they were mostly of the opinion that District 9 was a ""boring"" film.

In the end, I think the movie is worth seeing at least once, but not at current ticket prices. Wait until it becomes available for rent. You won't miss anything by not seeing it on a big screen.",1252108800,4,1786,4.963210702341137
3982004,5,B002SJIO5O,"I cannot name another film requiring special effects that does not make gratuitous superfluous overuse of them.  Mr. Bloemkamp is the careful kind of writer/director who's dual role keeps himself in check.  This is not Peter Jackson fantasy, though the main prawn sports his last name.  Jackson's folks at WETA have done a splendid job of transitioning from Tolkien-land to hyper-realism.  The use of the Red One Camera is a brilliant choice for capturing this action.  More people walked out than I have seen since Pulp Fiction.  But not for gore, for ""a little too-good"" realism.

The story is set in Joburg, Soweto and environs with apartheid rhyming loudly.  The slums, shacks and carcasses are all real.  District 9 itself is real, newly evacuated just before filming began.  Mr. Bloemkamp's genius balancing of the public point of view for the camera as a sort of news and documentary approach with the behind the scenes look into the prawn ghetto is greatly difficult made to look easy.  One way he deftly manages this complex approach is the bright idea of having separate units for documentary and interviews, keeping their own integrity from being lost in the big picture.

The story line has a simple enough outline.  An ship of aliens, given the name ""prawns"" in the best traditions of racism made intergalactic, arrived for unknown reasons a score years ago.  The inhabitants, seeming sickly and without organization, are moved to a Joburg hell hole.  The dicey situation has been under the management of a combination of Cheney's Haliburton and his buddies at Blackwater, but more disciplined, competent and empathetic.  There is the more honestly criminal presence of the Nigerian Racketeers, who remind me of the ones we have been dealing with for decades in global fraud rings as seen in credit card applications, and mail/email scams of the familiar ""We have need for you to take our deposit of $10 million...""  They have all been state sponsored for generations.  Here, they are the local purveyors of meat.  Prawns have a taste for canned cat food, which is reminiscent of a sadder but more real scene I see every week in the supermarkets as the poor, especially the elderly poor buy cat food cans for table use.

The central figure is a prototypical corporate shlub cum aparatchik, Wilkus.  He is straight out of Dilbert and other corporate functionary nightmares.  This is his journey.  He bullies his way in and battles out.  He encounters things that would stop even the Swedish Home Guard.  He slogs through games of base skull.  Mr. Copley is a brilliant actor in this difficult role.

Anymore would begin to give away more of the film than should be.  The City of Prague Orchestra does a fine job with the score, especially in contrast with the lonely solo voice of the slums.  Interestingly Mr. Jackson's uses the improbable name Wingnut Productions for his company.  This film is strong medicine, but of high value and never cheap.  We see that we have come to such a state that our real alien is truth itself.",1252022400,8,3039,4.85408560311284
3982005,2,B002SJIO5O,"What a shame. Another almost complete waste of time, reminiscent of the drab failure that was Children of Men. Here is a movie with so much potential, made with vast resources, whose more thoughtful scenes are completely eclipsed by the maniacal militaristic behaviour of the film's most poorly cast characters. In other words, whatever story might have been trying to come out of this meeting between aliens and humans was submerged more or less completely by all the bang, bang, bang arising from some truly mediocre scriptwriting. Or am I being too hard. Perhaps the moronic interactions of the tough guys in this film is exactly what the modern audience requires? If so, I wish there was some way of warning viewers who would like to see a film with some content, minus the blood, gore and guts produced by the hyperactive Hollywood nincompoops who make this kind of movie.

On the high side, the lead character is excellent as far as he is allowed to go, but the positions in which he finds himself create outlets for some truly disturbed thinking, in spite of the basic premise (the film did have potential, yes), which was not without interest. Yet are we really being asked to reflect on the meaning of human/alien relationships, which thought is mooted ever so gently near the beginning; are we really being asked to consider how much we have changed since the bad old days of the Johannesburg townships in the apartheid era (which are perhaps not really over, even yet)... No. In fact, we are simply blasted out of our seats and any value (or values) that the film set out to conjure with (or define) disappears in the vapid meanderings of an endless chasse  l'homme, which I'm sorry to say, we have all seen too many times before. I could go on to point out how the display of what is supposed to be advanced alien technology is really being used to show how clever the film's special effects people are, and so on, but I won't. The film could be dismantled further but it is hardly worth the effort. Truly unimaginative celluloid muck at its very best. As I say, what a shame.",1251763200,9,2088,4.62533692722372

3982009,4,B002SJIO5O,"I won't repeat what's said in the 60 reviews preceeding this. Doubtless you realize that it's a relatively low budget sci fi thriller set in South Africa that's had generally positive reviews by the critics--especially compared with Hollywood's usual crop of conceptually stale by-the-numbers action thrillers.

However, my wife found the violence and language too off-putting for her. I didn't mind that, but after seeing it in a theatre and going home and reading a bunch of reviews on the Rottentomatoes website, I was surprised to find that not one of them mentioned that this film was designed to be watched on a big screen TV at home.

To wit: it uses 16:9 big screen TV formatting rather than the normal movie theater widescreen ratio. And it's filled with tight close-ups and medium-range shots, which again optimizes it for TV viewing. Something like ""Master and Commander"" was great in a theatre, with beautiful, crisp, cinematography and shots that really exploited the movie theatre scale and format.

I'm not complaining about the director's choosing to optimize this film for DVD. Many films are, and that's fine. It's a good format, and I've enjoyed watching many films on our 46"" Samsung LCD TV. I am complaining about all those movie critics missing this fact, which was glaringly obvious in the first 5 minutes. If I'd known this I would have waited for the DVD.

BTW some critics didn't like the performance of Wikus, the central character. I thought he was fine, though, and so did my wife, and both of us are film buffs who love Kurosawa and other high art directors. He plays a doofus who's hamming it up for the documentary crew. But the actor isn't hamming. It's the character who is.

Some of these critics really should be working in a shoe store or something.

As sci fi films go, this isn't as fully realized as, say, ""Serenity."" OTOH the script is vastly better than anything George Lucas ever ""wrote.""

Really this is in the Hollywood B movie tradition, with both that tradition's faults and virtues. It's gritty, downbeat, morally complex (think Todd Browning's ""Freaks""), with an efficient plot and some very effective, somewhat grainy (purposely so) visuals. The image of the giant floating spacecraft is iconic.

So I'd say see it on your wide screen when it's released that way; warn those with queasy eyes and ears to leave the room; and don't expect one of those everything-neatly-tied-with-a-bow endings.

3982010,2,B002SJIO5O,"I just got back from watching this film on the big screen. I went into it with reasonably high expectations, as most everyone I know told me it was great, and the professional critics tended to agree. But after having seen it, I must say I am very disappointed. It began strong, with a documentary style: talking-heads discussing the events about to unfold in the film. But at about a little less than half-way through the film, it takes a nose-dive into the never-ending annals of generic film history. Yes, it invariably transforms into just another action flic at this point. It tries very hard to be thought provoking, but its delivery is a confused and inconsistent mess. And I also fault the film for creating very mixed feelings about the protagonist. First he seems one way and we feel this way about him, and then he acts in another way, then another, then another, and so on. Now, in more capable hands, that could very well make for a complex and engaging character, but after wards one is left with a troubling mixed and confused feelings about him. In the end, this only serves to separate us from him, as it is so very clear that such character-changing isn't very realistic. I couldn't relate to him at all.

This film tries to be thought-provoking and emotionally engaging, but it fails at both. Nearing its end, it gets ever so painfully cliched, not helping its purpose whatsoever. All in all, it was a very ridiculous film. Great sci-fi immerses you in a fascinating world to which you can relate, regardless of how far-fetched the world may be. Ironically, this is one of the least far-fetched sci-fi movies I have seen, and maintains no connection to reality.

There's definitely more I can fault this film for, but it was a late-night viewing and I ought to go to bed. My point remains:

As far as I am concerned, a movie either becomes a classic or adds to the heap of films ranging from utter crap to mediocrity. This film is not a classic. 3 stars for the first 50 or so minutes, 1 for the rest. I hope Moon, the next supposed ""great, faith-restoring sci-fi"" film on my viewing list, is better than this. Tentacles are crossed.",1251504000,14,2152,4.569948186528498
3982011,5,B002SJIO5O,"For a movie that was slated as 'Plan B' (after Peter Jackson's original Halo project was shelved indefinitely), this movie, in my opinion, certainly deserves to be placed in the 'A List' category.  It's a rare thing, especially with the current trend to go mega-budget for special effects, shallow plots and 'gosh-wow' explosions on screen in science fiction, to see a diamond peek out through the pile of charcoal.  This is one such movie.  It has something to say and says it in no uncertain terms.  What it does not do is say it in a preachy way.  You see it as it is and it's left up to you to decide how to take that message.

You can't really call D9 a sleeper hit, because it was advertised well enough and they smartly put Peter Jackson's name on it as part of the title to prick people's ears up when they saw the previews, but it conveys the same feel as an indie movie with a controversial theme.  Now, the theme in this movie is not so much controversial anymore, in that the points it discusses are well-known and have been documented for years, BUT,

it still hits a nerve for those with the sensitivity to see it, and does it with a new twist.

For those people who are in it only for a little bit of escapist fun, who think action is what a movie is all about, no, you're NOT going to 'get' District 9 and I would advise you to pass it by on the way to the alcove showing Transformers 2.  For those of you who are so de-sensitized to the evils of the world that you're bored to death when watching the national news, I would also suggest not spending your hard-earned cash to watch this movie.

For those who can (or want to) look at what's left unsaid in a story, I would HIGHLY recommend seeing District 9 at least once, even if you're not that into science fiction.

STORY-5 Stars
The story in D9 takes place in an area of the world known for it's historic inhumanity to man; Johannesburg, South Africa, and was filmed in a gritty documentarial style by director Neill Blomkamp, who grew up there and saw the cruelty firsthand and that in itself lends a dark authenticity to the project.

About twenty years prior, a spaceship of huge size descended to hover over the city of Jo'burg amid worldwide attention.  To Earth's surprise, all that happened afterward was a small shuttle that detached from its underside to land and bury itself in the ground.

And that was it.

Finally the world got tired of waiting.  Security forces under the aegis of the MNU drilled a hole to the ship's interior to find a host of millions of malnourished, nearly dead extraterrestrial creatures.  These were promptly ferried down to the surface, nursed back to health and cordoned off into an area outside the city dubbed District 9.

There were no shattering revelations from these beings.  There were no miracle cures for disease, no blueprints for clean unlimited power sources, or higher-order philosophical treatises on how we could improve our lives here on Earth.

There WERE weapons that they'd brought with them, but their usage was dependent on having the DNA coding possessed by these visitors, and these VISITORS showed no interest whatsoever in sharing the secret with us, so that was of absolutely no help.

These others, aside from their green exoskeletal covering and antennae, addiction to cat food, and rasping, croaking language, were in effect, JUST LIKE US.  They showed no ambition to better themselves, no desire to get their ship back in working order, nothing but simply surviving from day to day.  Just normal everyday living beings.  They were eventually given the derogatory label of 'prawn' and quietly relegated to becoming the new underclass of society, given only menial jobs for survival, the District 9 slum to live in, and no hope that things were ever going to get better.

The population of Johannesburg now becomes fed up with the prawn's proximity to the city and elects to forcibly evict them to the more concentration camp-style 'District 10'.  If the prawns are not going to help us out, they need to go away.  MNU's head of security appoints his son in law, Wikus Van De Merwe, to head up the relocation.  Happy sap that he is, he eagerly complies (even though he is clearly in over his head) and begins his trek through D9, smiling for the news cameras and displaying all of the illegal 'contraband' that turns up on a day-to-day basis in the encampment, from radios to computers to incubating eggs that he promptly orders destroyed.

In investigating one shack, he discovers a vial full of a strange dark liquid.  The seal breaks, spraying him in the face...

...And then the adventure begins.

For a supposed budget of just 30 million dollars (small potatoes for the U.S. but likely considered a HUGE budget in South Africa), the effects are some of the best I've seen and they're integrated with masterful skill into the real-world scenes.  The violence is graphic, but it's not gratuitous.  As a former Marine, I know what happens to a body when struck by a bullet, and the action sequences realistically portray the consequences of what occurs when someone is shot.  They're not pretty, nor should they be.  People should be made to understand in no uncertain terms what happens when you forcibly end a life.

SOUND-5 Stars
The musical score ain't rock and roll, but there are beautiful percussive riffs mixed in with ethnic vocals and these work to bring home the feel of the warm laid-back desolation of the continent of Africa.  I plan on buying the soundtrack for when I run my tabletop sci-fi gaming sessions.

In a nod to the regional dialects, the conversations are at times hard to understand, but there are subtitles placed at strategic locations throughout the movie for those unused to the non-human and the thick english accents.

OVERALL-5 Stars
The manner in which this film is laid out PERFECTLY conveys what happens when someone is pushed to reexamine all of their preconceived notions of life and then finds those notions lacking.

On the sci-fi side, it also asks the question:  If there is actually the possibility of life out there (like I truly believe there is) and our neighbors decide to come and visit, are our needs better served by extending our hand in friendship, or in force?...

...ESPECIALLY if they're technologically more advanced than we are?

3982012,5,B002SJIO5O,"Just watched the movie at the opening night and I am spellbound! Firstly, I am living in Johannesburg and was absolutely amazed at many a subtle hints and glances at history this movie gave. There were too many moments that only living in Johannesburg will make one truly understand what the director was hinting at, and all done and put together brilliantly in a way I haven't seen done much before. Secondly, I simply loved the way Neil (btw never heard of him before) didn't conform to the traditional and all too cliched Hollywood sci-fi recipe, and wasn't scared of breaking lots of Hollywood cinema 'laws'. Alien ships always land somewhere in the US, aliens are always here to kill us with no reason, we always are the experts in solving any issues in the end - none of these were followed. I read some reviews of the film being too racist, xenophobic, sexist etc. which were issues that I believe the director was actually trying to highlight to us, rather than capitalise on them. And these are real issues well and alive in many countries outside of South Africa, not sure why people pretend to see past and overlook them as if life is all perfect. In conclusion, a very thought-provoking movie for me that combines great elements of sci-fi action and storytelling - and maybe the message is, sometimes to be human again we have to think like and become alien.",1251417600,154,1370,4.6419753086419755
3982013,5,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is something that perhaps no one saw coming, and ends up being the absolute best movie of the summer hands down.  Produced by Peter Jackson and helmed by Neill Blomkamp (the director Jackson hand picked for the shelved Halo movie), District 9 depicts an alien race that came to Earth on an emergency basis a couple decades before hand, and have since become refugees in a violent slum in Johannesburg.  Bureaucrat Wikus (Sharlto Copley) is charged with serving eviction notices to the alien ""prawns"", and through a mishap, ends up undergoing a horrifying transformation that makes him a wanted man by everyone.  As he and a prawn dubbed Christopher Johnson become unlikely allies, things begin to really kick into high gear.  Beginning as part mockumentary and part satire on apartheid, District 9 takes its time to become a bloody full-blown action/sci-fi opus that stays with you long after the credits are done rolling.  What also helps make District 9 so good is that you truly never know what is going to happen next.  The sheer unpredictability of the film helps make it so magnetic, and newcomer Copley manages to be hateable, likable, and sympathetic all at the same time as his character continues to develop and change (literally) as the film goes on.  All in all, District 9 is an incredible science fiction film that features equal parts action and heart, and in a bloated summer full of empty blockbusters like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, G.I. Joe, and the like; it is indeed refreshing to see something like this on the big screen.  Do yourself a favor, don't miss out on District 9.",1251331200,10,1617,4.833333333333333

3982015,4,B002SJIO5O,"While the South African film industry hasn't exactly achieved the international prominence of those of more prolific nations such as the U.S, the U.K., and Japan, Neill Blomkamp's political allegory/action thriller District 9 seems poised to get the country at least a taste of cinematic notoriety.  It's certainly safe to say that those accustomed to American action films will have seen few (if any) movies quite like it.  District 9 is practically an indie action movie, relying as much on story and ideas as on set pieces and effects, but that's not at all to say that it can't bring the destruction when necessary.  It rides its ingenious premise, accomplished and distinctive visuals, and the impressively naturalistic performance of the completely unknown Sharlto Copley to an all-hell-breaks-loose conclusion that easily ranks among the most memorable of recent years.  If you've grown bored with mainstream cinema of late, this movie could well hit you like a shot of adrenalin jammed Pulp Fiction-style into your heart.

Since much of the movie relies on surprise it's tough to talk about the plot without giving away too much, but viewers with even a cursory knowledge of the history of Apartheid in South Africa will recognize the central allegory pretty quickly.  Taking place in the modern day, the film shows a South Africa that's partly populated by a race of insectoid aliens known as Prawns, whose bedraggled, malnourished remnant arrived over Johannesburg twenty years earlier.  As the faux-documentary footage in the beginning illustrates, the arrival of the Prawns has turned greater Johannesburg into a landscape of strictly enforced segregation, massive economic disparity, and barely-disguised bigotry (interestingly, from both black and white South Africans).  The allegory is hammered home in the opening scenes with all the subtlety of a Michael Bay movie, but that doesn't prevent it from having a few moments of cleverness, and it's actually handled pretty tastefully as the plot progresses.  The parallels the movie is making to racism in general and apartheid in particular are obvious, but after the beginning they're mercifully kept just beneath the surface, adding a layer of depth to the story without overpowering it.

Besides, once the uber-cool high-tech weaponry comes out and people start exploding, it won't matter what your politics are.  District 9 works reasonably well on a thematic and dramatic level, but it works extremely well on a tail-kicking level, serving as the kind of well-made action thriller that Hollywood rarely produces these days.  The action scenes are astonishing in their immediacy and visceral impact, and the special effects easily compete with those of far more expensive movies (suffice to say that every cent of the 30-million-dollar budget is evident on screen).  The visual genius isn't limited to the action either: the Prawns themselves are believably unpleasant looking without being too far removed from humanity, and the bodily corruption that becomes a key plot element as the film goes on is depicted with some legitimately unsettling imagery that wouldn't seem out of place in Alien (or Aliens for that matter).

Holding it all together is the compulsively watchable work of Copley, who's pretty much asked to carry the film as hapless mid-level functionary Wikus van de Merwe, by far the most significant human character.  At the start of the movie Wikus is a genial enough sort, skating by at least partly on his marriage to the incongruously attractive daughter of the CEO of the shadowy mega-corporation he works for.  When he's tapped to oversee the relocation of the Prawn population to a new slum farther removed from humanity, the operation starts out innocently enough, but when events take a turn for the worse, they go bad very quickly and very severely.  Even as Wikus's situation becomes increasingly nightmarish, though, Copley keeps his performance grounded and relatable, giving the movie a compelling intensity even before Blomkamp ramps up the pace of the action.  If this movie had been made in the U.S. there would almost certainly have been a big-name actor in this role, and he almost certainly wouldn't have been anywhere near as good as Copley is here.

Despite the rather fantastic plot, the movie still takes place in a world that very much resembles our own, with real-world touches ranging from the cartoonishly evil Nigerian gangsters that relentlessly profiteer in the alien territories to the brutal, ultra-racist soldiers who enforce the quasi-apartheid (presumably modeled on the real-life race police from the days of actual apartheid).  In the end District 9 is a pretty odd mix of realism, escapism, action, and emotion, but you'd be hard-pressed to deny its originality or its intelligence.  ""Scrappy"" is one word I've seen used to describe this movie, and I'd have a hard time coming up with a better label--it doesn't have a huge budget or big-name stars, but it keeps hammering away until there's little choice but to be caught up in its vision.  District 9 is definitely not for everyone, but those who can appreciate Blomkamp's imagination should be more than pleased.",1251244800,9,5190,5.190419161676647
3982016,4,B002SJIO5O,"""District 9"" is as much social satire as it is a sci-fi thriller, and this multi-layered approach results in some horrifying comments that would be hilarious if you didn't think about what they meant.  Shot in part-documentary (a la ""The Office""), part-adventure-movie style, ""District 9"" is set in Johannesburg, South Africa, in a future where aliens have been stranded on Earth and their enormous mothership is hovering, disabled, above the city.  The aliens, called ""prawns"" by the humans because of their appearance, have been moved into a gigantic slum where they are, for lack of a better word, de-humanized by the atrocious conditions -- famine, filth, and laws meant to oppress them.  When the government agency overseeing them decides that they should be moved out of the city to a more convenient location, the conflict is set in motion.  Wimpy, over-eager, and (at first) unsympathetic Wikus (Sharlto Copley) becomes the unlikely protagonist as the film thrusts viewers in the midst of the horrifying reality of Wikus's fate in the alien slums and his interactions with Christopher, an alien who knows more than the rest.

The satire here is dark and deep, with moments like Wikus gleefully pointing out the popping sound of alien eggs exploding in a fire.  That Wikus can love his wife so deeply and yet feel no remorse when aliens are blown away serves as a powerful contradiction.  While the parallels to apartheid are heavy-handed, the film moves forward with such speed that that realization doesn't linger or spoil the overall effect.  In fact, this link between human race relations history and the situation of the aliens gives this film its context.  Without it, the audience might be cheering for the destruction of the aliens instead of experiencing discomfort or, in more pointed moments, horror.  This is not your typical aliens-from-outer-space flick.

The cinematography uses dingy hues to evoke a desperate world, with humans at their cruelest.  The looming mothership is frightening, even though it is disabled, and it reminds the audience of who is usually the aggressor in such films.  This makes the alien violence against humans both expected and sad, because if we were in their position, we would rebel as well.

Be forewarned: this is a violent, disturbing film.  The end of the movie points toward a sequel in three years, so expect ""District 10"" to surface in the near future, especially given the commercial success of ""District 9.""

3982018,4,B002SJIO5O,"There is a tendency to view science fiction films that deal with ordinary problems of human existence under a prism of allegory.  Thankfully, DISTRICT 9 does not go that route as it takes an undercurrent of racism and uses it not to suggest a subtext of meaning beyond the film but to internalize it as yet one more gripping ingredient in a film loaded with them.  Director Niell Blomkamp uses a narrative that mixes interviews from the past and present of the film with a plot that begins in moral confusion but ends in ringing clarity.

Twenty years ago, a huge spaceship appears over Johannesburg, South Africa. After a waiting period, the authorities cut her open to discover its occupants, a race of beings that have faces that remind the viewer of Schwarzenegger's Predator and a lizard-like lower torso that smacks of grim reality even though it is a computer generated series of images.  These aliens are a ragged bunch, hungry, sick, and leaderless.  Their leaders all have died in transit.  The South African government places them in a quarantine that rapidly becomes a slum, where they are forced to live a squatters' filthy existence.  At this point, the viewer might think that Blomkamp is using his craft to make a statement about the Meaning of Racism.  Such a blunt appraisal is premature.  What gradually emerges is the story of how one ordinary government worker is faced with the reality of one small group of immigrants (even in the millions) is faced with hostility from a much larger group that prides itself on open dialogue but still is replete with those who see the newcomers, called Prawns, as nothing more than a subjected minority that must be endured or exploited.  This government worker is typical of the ""good citizens"" of white South Africa.  He is full of prejudice but thinks he is not.  Slowly, he grows in moral stature as he comes to see the Prawns as distinct individuals with rights that must be respected.  These rights are not respected, and a race is on to exploit them in ways that will benefit the white majority.  Without giving too much of the plot away, I came to see things through his eyes and the eyes of one of the Prawns, one who began as an adversary to the worker but quickly began to co-operate in a way that requires co-operation as the means to survive.  There is plenty of racism to go around.  The film presents Nigerians as loathsome gangsters and government security forces as racist thugs.  All senior government officials are slimy in their self-serving oiliness.  The government worker who is the lead and the Prawn who befriends him emerge as the moral centers of the film.  If one overlooks the science fiction rationale and the CGI effects, what remains is still a terrific film that uses racism not to beat up a racist society but to hold up a movie that can stand on its own in a manner that all quality films can: gripping directing, solid acting, and a respect for the viewer's intelligence.",1251072000,6,2965,4.700193423597679
3982019,4,B002SJIO5O,"This movie was pretty good once it actually got the story line going, the beginning is rather boring however, because all they are doing is interviewing people, which didn't have to be a bad thing, but how they started it i didn't even know it was the movie at first..and the people they interview go on rambling for some time.

The story line and everything was pretty good but it kept leaving me hanging at certain parts with unanswered questions.. what happened to the dude at the end? Did he die or get captured? if he died how would the alien be able to keep his promise?

Another thing that kind bugged me was how Humans were able to understand what the aliens were saying, how did they learn that language? Did they just learn it over time? I don't know maybe i think too hard into things, to me it just seemed like there were alot of events that led to unanswered questions.

3982020,5,B002SJIO5O,"Were this movie directed and produced by Hollywood brand names, it would have failed on all accounts and would have burned a very big black hole in their pockets.  This movie has received more hype and critical acclaim than The Matrix and has proven that this is the little movie that could and has - come so far out of left field that it has knocked all and sundry for six.

Sharlto's portrayal of Wickus is spot on - it takes another South African to recognise the performance and the satirical nuances and cheeky slap at how a typical Afrikaner bureaucrat may act in reality. He is naive, unsophisticated and gormless like Mr Bean.  He is self serving to the end and his moral compass operates in a very large grey area but the fact that he remains true to character right to the end and does not transform into a Bill Pulmanesque (Independence Day)type freedom fighter feels real and the audience automatically buys into this. He has no hesitation in aborting an alien egg but refuses to test fire the alien weapon against the helpless 'prawn'.

Johannesburg is as cosmopolitan as New York and London on the one hand and as riddled by squalor and shanty towns as any other 3rd World country on the other.  The Nigerian factor in the movie also rings true, despite several critics who questioned their significance in the movie.  Generally, South Africans across the racial spectrum have a very dim and suspicious opinion of Nigerians.  Nigerians have been in the news for all the wrong reasons - cheque fraud scams, drug and prostitution rackets and being, justly or unjustly, involved at all levels of crime in South Africa.  That they operate a cat food scheme in District 9 among the aliens is also a testament to the corruption and maladministration in the security (MNU in this case) forces that patrol the camp.  This is an accurate parallel to the South African Police Service that is riddled by corruption and incompetance and is wholly understaffed.",1250985600,6,1962,4.730205278592376
3982021,5,B002SJIO5O,"Note: For those who have not seen the film, there are no ""spoilers"" in the review. The plot details I list have little to do with the focus of the story aside from providing exposition.

""District 9"" is one of those rare gems that immediately immerses you in its world. Beginning in medias res with stark images of a massive spacecraft hovering over Johannesburg, the audience quickly discovers it's been there for over thirty years by the time our story picks up. For months after the craft appeared the Earth waited for a response. When none came, the decision was made to send special teams to board the vessel and finally get some answers. What they got, instead, were more questions.

The aliens inside were malnourished, unhealthy and their intelligence appeared to be below that of most humans. Labeled ""prawns"" due to their appearance, the aliens were removed from the ship and placed into a temporary encampment known as District 9, which has rapidly deteriorated into an outright slum. Enter Wikus van der Merwe, a seemingly naive yet likeable fellow employed with Multinational United (M.N.U.), the pseudo-U.N. organization tasked with handling the prawns. He's just received a promotion and is ordered to relocate the prawns to a newer camp set up in an area more isolated from humanity.

While the scope of ""District 9"" seems initially epic, the film wisely follows a very focused tale centered on Wikus and a prawn known as Christopher. As the story unfolds, the development of these characters is outstanding - particularly for an action-oriented film. A lesser film would've transformed Wikus into a more compassionate person as the events transpired, perhaps even culiminating into some sort of freedom fighter for the prawns. With this film, however, we're finally presented with a very real, very flawed character.

Even at his best, Wikus is a wholly self-serving individual and stands as a damning indictment of humanity as a whole. His most selfless act in the film is tempered by the fact that it's still in his best interests to do so. Christopher is, ironically, the most human character here and is unquestionably the most deserving of sympathy. Yet it's interesting to note how many still think Wikus is the true victim of it all. Watch how cunningly manipulative Wikus is when he's attempting to evict the prawns. His demeanor is slick and polished. He uses bribes, lies, and outright threats against them - not to mention the intimidating image of armed soldiers and armored vehicles surrounding the prawns.

The documentary format in which the film is shot is a phenomenal aspect and one which is very original and innovative. Technically this technique has been used before, but it's typically in something like a Christopher Guest comedy and nothing substantially riveting aside from humor. Some have critiqued this film for dropping the documentary style mid-way through and becoming a more action-oriented film. However, had they paid closer attention, the reason for this is quite evident. It's made clear at the beginning of the film that the persons providing the commentary have no idea what happened to Wikus, or indeed what really happened in District 9. M.N.U. predictably covered it all up and only the audience is privy to what really occured. Their commentary mid-way through the film would've been precisely what it is at the end - mere conjecture and thus useless to the audience.

Further, some have felt the film draws large plot elements from a myriad of other films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enemy-Mine/dp/B000059HAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enemy Mine</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robocop/dp/B000QQH4YS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robocop</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Nation/dp/B000059HAD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Nation</a>. This can hardly be a criticism, because ""District 9"" incorporates elements from these films in only the broadest sense possible. It's akin to declaring that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-History-X/dp/6305313687/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American History X</a>&nbsp;is influenced by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Kill-a-Mockingbird/dp/0783225857/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Kill a Mockingbird</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hart-s-War/dp/B00005JKTP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hart's War</a>&nbsp;is influenced by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Escape/dp/B0001GF2EM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Escape</a>. While there may be a modicum of truth to this, the respective narratives are much too wildly divergent to be categorized in this manner. I can agree, however, that it seems very unlikely (even for a science fiction film) that the fuel/fluid could perform both the uses it does in the film. Still, this plot device provides an excellent catalyst for what transpires and is entirely forgiveable.

I've read some critics believe the themes are a bit on the nose, and while I definitely concur that occasionally a subtle route is best, ""District 9"" is so thematically rich and the narrative is complex enough that this rings as a hollow criticism.  ""District 9"" is, on the surface, an action film. Yet this film has more to say about human nature than any film in years. If this weren't so, how else could a film about alien creatures on Earth feel so real?

The polarizing opinions and wildly diverse interpretations of this film are precisely what writer/director Neill Blomkamp was aiming for.  It's been labeled as both a brilliant allegory of apartheid and of the Iraqi war, it's been accused of somehow being a 'racist' film, while others simply see it as violently offensive rubbish. Many watch ""District 9"" and cannot see the forest for the trees, they simply cannot see past the gore and violence to the core of the film.  Further, they want the film to provide answers and solutions, when the truth they're unable to face is that there are no viable solutions.

These spirited debates, in a sense, mirror the ones in the film concerning the handling and treatment of the prawns. Ultimately, whether you like or dislike this film, it'll almost certainly have you talking about it for days afterwards. This can be credited to the fact that, once the smoke clears, there is a very real beating heart at the center of ""District 9"" (provided you're able to look beneath the surface). In the end, these are the true marks of a lasting, important film.

* The text hereafter refers to the features included on the 2-Disc DVD of ""District 9"". As this assumes you've already seen this film, fair warning, there are spoilers below. The disc has two menu screens, one in an M.N.U. design and one in a prawn design, the difference between the two being entirely cosmetic. It's a nice touch to a fantastic home video release. The first disc contains three special features: a fine selection of deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, and a commentary track with director Neill Blomkamp. There are roughly twenty-three minutes of deleted scenes that shed a little more light on Blomkamp's vision. Almost all are little more than a minute each and a few have incomplete special effects (much like the ones from the recent ""Star Trek"" release). A handful are uninteresting filler, but the best ones range from a scientist explaining the reproductive habits of the prawns to one which depicts Wikus forcefully stealing the vehicle he drove to the M.N.U. headquarters. While I enjoyed the scenes immensely, I feel it was a wise decision not to offer an ""extended"" version of the film. The pacing of ""District 9"" is lighting quick without feeling rushed, something that the addition of these scenes would've ruined entirely.

Next is a thirty-four minute making-of featurette which offers a generalized overview of how the film was conceived, shot, and edited. I'm not typically interested in this sort of thing, but a film like ""District 9"" is anything but typical itself, so I found this highly entertaining. It's precisely what one expects from a feature of this sort - plenty of interviews with the cast & crew along with some great behind the scenes footage. Watch for an amusing scene where Sharlto attempts to eat his lunch using his alien hand. Rounding out the first disc is a commentary track which is also excellent, well-stocked with Blomkamp's wealth of tales and comments about the genesis of the film. If he at times spends a bit too much time describing rather personal details, they still only serve to provide deeper insight into the film, especially considering Blomkamp was such an integral part of the film's creation. There are plenty of details covered here that aren't mentioned in the other features, though some of it could be considered a bit extraneous. (All of the above is also included on the single disc version.)

The second disc contains four featurettes which in toto run approximately forty-five minutes. These are focused on a specific aspect of the film's production, as opposed to the more generalized feature on the first disc. The first is called ""Metamorphosis"" and highlights how the makeup crew gradually transformed Sharlto Copley's character from human to alien (if you liked seeing how the ""Benjamin Button"" crew transformed Brad Pitt, you'll love this one too). The second is ""Conception and Design"" which details the inspirations and ideas that led to the creation of the film. It's interesting to watch Blomkamp acknowledge previous sci-fi films that served as templates for the themes he wanted to flesh out with his own film, while simultaneously illustrating how brilliantly original the mechanics of ""District 9"" are. The piece begins with some great photos and information on how Weta Workshop created the unique alien weaponry. The third is ""Alien Generation"" which delves into the special effects work. This primarily focuses on the mechanics of creating the aliens and making them interact seamlessly with the human characters. The fourth is ""Innovation"" which details Blomkamp's approach to directing the actors in the film, along with how he felt improvisation was the key to making the film feel more organic. All of these features have tons of interviews and comments from the cast & crew (including Blomkamp & Copley).

The Blu-Ray version includes all of the above as well as the ubiquitous digital copy and an exclusive feature called ""Joburg from Above: Satellite and Schematics of the World of District 9"". This is a unique feature which allows the user to explore sensitive locales on both the alien and M.N.U. sides with an interactive map. Also included are a couple of newish features popping up on all new Blu-Rays: the ""CineChat"" feature, which allows users to chat with friends while watching movies; and ""MovieIQ"" which provides a large database of technical information about the film. For those who are interested in this sort of thing, there's also a demo for a video game called ""God of War III"" for the Playstation 3 which includes a making-of clip once the demo is completed. I don't own a PS3 so I can't comment on the quality of this feature. A final note: the one feature that many hoped would be included is absent on all versions, which is the original ""Alive in Joburg"" short that inspired the film. However, the short can easily be located and viewed online.",1250812800,515,11609,5.430393788130893

District 9 is an enjoyable, sci-fi action movie about aliens on planet Earth. Typically these humans vs. aliens movies are the majority through the aliens being the bad guys. However, this movie is opposite of that. Humans are the bad guys and their target are aliens. Aliens land on earth malnourished and near death. They are ""rescued"" by humans but eventually displaced in Johannesburg, Africa. Essentially living as prisoners, refugees (whatever you want to call it). They are held in District 9. However, strong resentment of the aliens leads the public to once again call for the aliens to go elsewhere.  This story reminded a bit of the X-MEN comics in that humans hate the mutants (who are not evil and bent but nonetheless are targeted as such) and mutants have to fight for themselves against a lot of prejudice and hate.

Back to the movie, the aliens are evicted by their homes by MNU agent  Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley).  Wikus is hard to describe. He's a corporate geek, a yes man, and he is part ass as he kicking this aliens ""prawns"" around like their nothing. Then Wikus is the victim of an alien fluid which transforms him into one of the aliens he realizes he must help them out as they are the only chance he has to be human.

District 9 strikes a lot of home runs for its original plot, the great acting, comedy, and ideas it presents on the screen. The aliens essentially if you want to break this movie down are all passing for human...in other words what happens to the aliens is indicative of how people often treat a group of people who are different. It's no wonder as well that this took place in Africa with its troubling history. The movies special effects are top notch. The documentary style used in the movie fits it perfectly.

The movie, however, by the second half after presenting so many complex issues decides to follow the direction of so many  alien movies before it turning into one giant shoot em contest with blood and guts with nothing thought provoking left.

Despite this though it's a good movie. It has everything you could want from the alien genre with the way it's presented and told. It does try to distinguish from the genre by posting to the audiences the themes of prejudice, apartheid, empathy, hate, and of course one's self-preservation no matter what they have brought on themselves or others have brought on them. With names like Peter Jackson involved it does deliver the goods.

This was Neill Blomkamp's remake of Alive in Joburg also worth your time watching.

Anyhow, I enjoyed District 9. I think you'll enjoy it too.",1250812800,7,2602,4.673960612691466
3982023,3,B002SJIO5O,"I viewed this movie alone in an audience of 95% male. I chose not to read reviews before going so I did not know what to expect. The movie right from the start belts you in the face with a political premise. As stated before, there are a lot of questions to be asked about the nature of the film.  Aliens getting stranded here, possible, but not probable.  Since humans have not made it to other planets, it would seem the more intelligent species would have a way to extradite themselves from our society with their superior weaponry, intelligence, and viable resources to achieve these goals.  Instead, they choose to subjugate themselves to the human race by living as illegal aliens fighting over cat food.

Come On Really???

I have an aversion to gore as most females do but even the men in the audience gushed a few yucks, I covered my eyes over most of the gore, so as not to lose my popcorn, as food was often done in the movie.  As stated there were no likeable characters in the movie except Christopher which Enemy Mine comes into thought. The main character was a jerk until a little bit of moral heroism at the end only came into factor when he realized his options of retaining human qualities were shortlived. His wife was a total bimbo so they were equally yoked.  I ended up rooting for the aliens (I often do) especially in getting rid of the pesky mercenary that would not stay down (excuse the pun) until he was eaten.  Christopher promised 3 years-to return - is that when we are to expect the sequel.  Don't get me wrong guys - I stayed with the movie all the way through but do all aliens have to be ooey gooey insects.
Final take, I thought it was ok but it saddened me to see such inhumanity displayed, because I know it was all too real. Atrocities have been implemented all throughtout history regardless of the color of ones skin, religous beliefs etc etc.  so those who are stating prejudice need to study history (accurately) not CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC tripe. The sad thing is we never come up with a solution to stop it - not even in the movies where the writer,producer,director, has the power to create just that- a solution. Long story short - just take it as it is and watch - when it is over -  go see another.",1250726400,9,2243,4.380722891566265
3982024,5,B002SJIO5O,This is a truly incredible film that I enjoyed thoroughly.  The story is very creative and the way it plays out visually is a wonder to behold. The aliens(prawns)are presented painstakingly well and anyone who talks about how cheesy they look has little idea of how much hard work and care goes into breathing life into characters like this in film. I was greatly impressed with this movie and look forward to more from this director.,1250640000,5,434,4.7105263157894735
3982025,5,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is the freshest movie I have seen this summer. It's also the best sci-fi film to come along in years. It's about a government agent (Sharlto Copley) assigned to evict aliens from their home. But things go horribly wrong for him when he exposes himself to alien technology that starts turning him into one of them. The government wants to run tests on him, rather than help him. In order to survive, he has to put his life in the hands of one of the aliens who claims he can help.

  I found Sharlto's character to not be too likable until the middle of the film. Before that, I found him to be a little annoying. But his performance and the movie get better as it goes on. The documentary parts of the movie are fresh and I haven't seen anything like them in a science fiction film.

  While the action is very entertaining as well. I have to say I was more into the action in this film than I was from most of the big anticipated summer movies I've seen this year. The director was also more talented than most of the directors that got hired to make those movies. I liked Star Trek, but this movie was better written and directed than every other film.",1250640000,6,1165,4.2727272727272725
3982026,5,B002SJIO5O,"For those of you expecting an unsatisfying, empty calorie, popcorn fest you better check your appetite at the door.  District 9 is a slow cooked, flame kissed, filet of science fiction that is unlike anything I've ever seen.  It's fills you up, leaves you satisfied and surprisingly doesn't give you the ""Hershey Squirts"" the next day.

District 9 is the bizarre love child of first time film director Neill Blomkamp and mega director, Peter Jackson.  Way back when Halo was supposed to become a major motion picture, Jackson was signed on to produce and Blomkamp was tapped to direct.  The film eventually fell apart and Jackson decided to turn Blomkamp's amazing short film, ""Alive in Joburg"" into a summer blockbuster.  Alive in Joburg was a fake documentary about Aliens living among us in the slums of Johannesburg, South Africa.  District 9 is more or less the full length vision of that short film.  It deals with a race of aliens derogatively known as ""Prawns"" who are struggling to survive in a man made slum of Johannesburg known as District 9.  The aliens are called ""Prawns"" due to their resemblance of the sea creature with the same name (that's shrimp to us Americans).  I personally think they look the twisted offspring of a cockroach after it received the evil seed of The Great Cthulu.

The whole film is heavy with its social commentary and leave it to the sci-fi genre to make one of the most eye opening films in the past decade.  It effectively deals with issues such as political power, corrupt corporations, biological weapons, racism, xenophobia, the poor class and much more.  Surprisingly, the movie deftly packs its dime-bag of sticky-icky knowledge drug into your pipe without ever smelling like a heavy handed propaganda film.  District 9 is effectively chilling with its sledgehammer to the skull portrayal of these dilapidated alien slum dwellings, yet don't be surprised when it causes you to genuinely smile or laugh.  Leave it to a disciple of Jackson to make it easy to relate to a CG creature.  I haven't felt this much empathy for a home stricken alien since E.T.

If there is but one flaw it's the heavy use of CG in the film.  For a sci-fi flick that wears its realism on its sleeve, the aliens come across as hokey.  They are finely detailed and superbly animated but they can still rip you out of the experience.  However, they are so perfectly developed as sentient-beings through excellent exposition that they eventually become remarkably believable.  This helps keep things grounded which is important since the film is filled with many far-fetched devices such as high tech weaponry that looks like it was ripped out of Unreal Tournament or Ratchet and Clank.

The documentary storytelling is driven by handheld camera shots, security cam footage and even mock interviews.  It all feels as cohesive as something you would watch on CNN or the Military Channel.  This approach does cause the pacing to be very uneven and some people might get frustrated with this.  I however was fully entranced with Wickus van der Merwe's (Shartlo Copley) startling voyage that shakes the pillars of his every belief and changes his life.  His genuine depiction of an average Joe caught up in extraordinary circumstances is highly believable and surprisingly relatable thanks to the flawed nature of his character.  You will ride his emotional rollercoaster right alongside him and it gives the movie soul which elevates District 9 above the typical dreck that infests the cinemas during the swamp-[...] inducing summer months.

District 9 is one of the best Sci-Fi films I've ever seen and I wholehearted suggest that you see it.  Just see it so that you can support such unique and brilliant filmmaking because I for one want to see what Blomkamp can do after this.  I've done my part and now you need to do yours.  Go watch this movie.

3982027,1,B002SJIO5O,"I'm starting to truly believe that a large segment of the human race (mostly male) has a defective gene. This defective gene causes a love of gruesome violence and a total lack of concern for the suffering of others. This gene also promotes binary thinking - the guy with the white hat is good and the guy with the black hat is bad. There's no in-between. And if there is - who cares!

A certain segment of Hollywood knows how to precisely exploit this genetic weakness and billions of dollars pour into their bank accounts. Telling a good story is a lost cause for this segment of the population. Show as much blood, guts, torture and torment as possible. It's such a formula recipe, it could be written on the back of a matchbook cover: Blood, guts, action = BILLIONS, year in, and year out! Why didn't I think of that?

If you love oceans of blood, vomiting, heads and limbs popping off of bodies with regularity, a graphic torture chamber used for medical experiments and repeated attempts at cutting off someone's arm - then District 9 is for you! And there is also ZERO sexuality in this film. (Why am I not surprised?)

The only reason I didn't walk out was because I wanted to see if the good guys were going to win in the end. I did actually care about the main characters and the gruesome violence made watching District 9 all that much sadder and annoying to watch.

THIS NOT A FILM FOR CHILDREN!! If the images shown do not disturb your children, I suggest they need to get some help. THIS IS A WAR PORN MOVIE! It exploits the audience, plain and simple!

Beside feeling sad, I felt empty when I left the theater. Lucky for me I was able to sneak into another movie and watch it for free. It showed only a single act of serious (and accidental) violence and that story was an absolute delight! Too bad Hollywood doesn't make more great movies that actually entertain instead of making films that are so depressing and annoying!

3982028,5,B002SJIO5O,"This summer it seems that Science Fiction is finally returning, after an extended leave of absence while the audience was fed pop-corn science fantasy.

District 9 is a gritty and deeply disturbing film that is also incredibly timely.  In a moment in history when we are actually debating if it is alright to let people die because they cannot afford to pay us for health care or food, this movie grimly follows one man's life as he becomes simply a commodity for others' profit.  It exposes our sometimes thoughtless cruelty.. and sometimes deliberate cruelty as a species and leaves the viewer to ask themselves if thats what we really want to be.

One warning: This movie is graphically brutal.  I think it was necessary in order for it to accomplish what it set out to do, but it is often not an easy movie to watch.

This might be the most important movie of the year... if its not too far over the heads of those it needs to reach.",1250553600,8,937,4.482352941176471
3982029,5,B002SJIO5O,"While searching for alien encounter videos, I discovered a little clip titled ""Alive in Jo'burg"" on YouTube by Neill Blomkamp.  Fortunately for us, Blomkamp's ill-fated Halo movie was delayed, so he went back to his roots with the film that started it all: District 9.

If you've seen Alive in Jo'burg you know much of what's going on in District 9 (this review contains spoilers!). In essence, a giant alien saucer lands on Earth and its citizens are repatriated in Johannesburg. However, the aliens are ugly, uncivilized squid-like monstrosities and thus integration attempts (when they happen at all) go poorly.  The movie begins with a battle with a telekinetic mech and ends with riots in the streets.

District 9 adds meat to the bones of this highly original film. The aliens are no longer blurry actors in masks but crustacean-like beasts in fully-realized CGI. The ship and the conflict in Johannesburg is still a major plot point, but it is explored through Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley). Wikus is a bigoted but cheerful company man who just happens to be married to the daughter of the head of Multi-National United (MNU). He documents the task of relocating the ""prawns"" (a racial slur for the aliens) to a concentration camp through video, with frequent asides asking the producer to remove particularly embarrassing shots in editing.

In this tightly scripted film, every detail is important: the fact that the aliens have powerful weapons technology only they can use; that the Nigerians take advantage of the prawns by selling them prostitution (and all that implies) and cans of cat food in exchange for said weapons; and that the Nigerians believe they can acquire the power of a prawn through cannibalism.

Blomkamp quickly achieves a sense of rising dread through documentary-style clips where various experts expound on ""what Wikus did."" The special effects used in creating the prawn are a critical part of making them utterly alien. This is counterbalanced by a horrifying scene where Wikus destroys prawn eggs by setting them ablaze, comparing the popping sound of the roasting babies to popcorn.  As a new parent, when Wikus threatens a young prawn, I flinched.  And just like that, I was now on the side of the aliens.

An important but unlikely plot twist brings Wikus around to the alien side of life. Betrayed by his company and his father-in-law, he has no choice but to work with Christopher Johnson, an alien who knows more than he lets on. Together, they unveil the depth of corruption in both the squalid slums of Johannesburg and the clean corporate offices of MNU.  No organization or race walks out of this film unscathed.

3982031,2,B002SJIO5O,"I went into this film expecting to see a movie about aliens attempting to come to Earth in a peaceful way, but then being greeted by aggressive humans, and prevented from leaving.  Then, I expected to see the aliens be forced into an aggressive stance, thus, wiping out the humans when everyone could've gotten along swimmingly if only the humans would behave and not be so hostile.  How ironic a movie that would be right?  Humans natural aggression causing their own demise??  I wrote a better film in my own head....then I walked into this mess.

I awarded two stars simply because some of the action sequences are exciting and well done.  Now, I can pretty much see good action in any run of the mill film these days so it's hardly worth a star.  To start with, why are the humans and aliens able to communicate so easily?  Why are the aliens so strong in one scene then weak and feeble in the next?  Why are the aliens able to read and write English?  How can the main charactor operate the alien machines so easily simply because he has only just begin his transformation?  Why is this film so obviously racist against blacks/Nigerians?  Why was this such a pathetic rip off of E.T.?  i.e. they want you to root for the baby alien to get home safely and the bad scientists won't let him leave.

There is a scene in this film in which the agents find a gun inside an aliens hut, and the alien actually says ""It's not mine.""  Am I watching a bad episode of cops here?  I thought Peter Jackson would do a good job with this after King Kong, but my goodness the stupidity factor was insulting here folks.

3982034,5,B002SJIO5O,"DISTRICT 9 works spectacularly well.  There, I thought I'd just sum it all up right at the beginning.  You can stop reading now.  It's simply one of the very few movies of this year (which has not so far been a great year for movies) that I can call an unqualified success.  Does it have a few little problems?  Of course it does.  But there are too many things that go so very right to spend much time nitpicking.

There are two primary reasons the film works.  First, it has a wonderfully original premise.  And second, it has the best leading character I've seen in a film this year, with perhaps the most compelling character arch I've seen in a long time.  So a great story with great characters...WOW!

About 20 years ago, a gigantic spaceship came to earth.  It stopped directly over the city of Johannesburg...a large city known very much for its squalor and slums.  And there the ship stopped...basically ""broken down"" in a bad neighborhood.  The aliens on board were starving and without leadership...so in a well-meant fit of compassion, a massive rescue effort began to bring the well over 1 million aliens down to earth, where they carved out an increasingly uneasy co-existence with an increasingly hostile human population.  They were the ultimate unwanted refugees.  These aliens, nicknamed ""Prawns"" because of their resemblance to giant, walking shrimp were scavengers on the fringes of society, living in horrific conditions and with personal habits that didn't sit well with humans.

They also brought with them some pretty interesting weapons, but sadly, the human corporations that dearly want to make use of them can't, because the weapons only work when handled by aliens.  The Prawns willingly trade their weapons for cat food (their favorite food), because remember, these are the ""simple"" prawns who have no real leadership.

Finally, a frustrated populace contracts with a big conglomerate to relocate the aliens to a distant camp, some 200 miles from the city.  Because ""human rights"" (ah, the irony) are watching, the company decides to relocate the irksome aliens in a very ""legal"" way, so a mid-level bureaucrat named Wikus van de Merwe (best movie hero name in a long time) is charged with leading a militarized group of paper pushers into the alien slums to serve all the aliens with eviction notices.  The logistics of this stagger the mind.

Wikus is seen in the earlier parts of the film through documentary footage, shot by a crew who are recording the events leading up to the eviction.  He's a mild-mannered nerd...a career bureaucrat who has been given the chance of a lifetime to prove himself...but he's also painfully aware that his boss is his father-in-law...and that the man almost wants Wikus to screw up so he can finally prove his son-in-law is the waste of time he always thought he was.  So we sympathize with poor, sweater-vest wearing Wikus right from the start.

But it turns out that while he's a nerd among humans, he also has a casually cruel contempt for Prawns.  He readily insults them, pushes them around and has very little good to say about their habits or their intelligence.  He's a racist...or whatever the word would be for creatures from outer space.  (Although, frankly, most of the Prawns DO seem like blithering idiots.)

The events of this eviction are interesting enough, but they serve mostly to lead to the moment where Wikus unwittingly sprays himself in the face with some ""alien gunk"" and the course of his life, and perhaps human history, is forever altered.

I hate to spoil too much, but I must say that Wikus goes through some physical transformations that lead him down the road to some character changes.  As his value to his company changes, he finds out some grim truths about the company and the man he's been working for.  He also realizes just how much he values his humanity and just how much he loves his wife.

Wikus also spends much of the film in abject fear.  Yet through that fear, he manages to pull of some pretty brave stuff, out of desperation.  He forms an oddly touching alliance with a Prawn and that Prawn's young child.  Yet almost every time we find him being admirable, he pulls something cowardly or self-serving.  It takes him a VERY long time to understand that not all Prawns are morons, and that perhaps they do share some common ground.  Yet we wonder throughout, will Wikus give in to his weak side, or will something heroic emerge?

For such a big, loud, bloody film...the track that Wikus' character follows is surprisingly nuanced and touching and frustrating and uplifting.  Dare I say, Wikus was one of the most credible action-movie ""heroes"" I've seen in a very  long time.  And unknown Sharlto Copley, a long-time friend of writer/director Neil Blomkamp, does a fabulous job.  Copley plays Wikus as an open book...a man not accustomed to lying and hiding his true self.  When he's feeling unsafe, we see it.  When  he's missing his wife, it's there in plain sight.  When he's pulling himself up by his own bootstraps to confront a Nigerian gang lord, we see the change in the way he holds his face.  It's a performance as unpolished as the film...and yet it is nearly perfect.  When, near the end of the film, we see a film clip of Wikus that was taken right after his promotion but before anything had hit the fan...it's nearly heartbreaking to contemplate all the man has been through.

The film uses the documentary style that's becoming so common (think CLOVERFIELD)...yet even that is too simple.  The camera is steadier, the editing is more controlled.  It FEELS like that kind of low-budget, hand-held style...yet it IS more formal.  It evoked another fine recent film, THE HURT LOCKER.  The special effects are nearly seamless...producer Peter  Jackson once again shows how his special effects group, WETA (created for LORD OF THE RINGS) can run circles around most of the work being done today.  The movie was made for $30 million, but feels like a $100 million Hollywood film in its production values.

I mentioned flaws earlier.  I wish the film had clarified just a little bit better what happened to the leadership of the alien craft.  And a couple of the action sequences were a little disjointed...occasionally, I wasn't sure where people were in relation to each other.  But these are really minor flaws in the scheme of things.  The film gets all the important things right.

It is R-rated, because the f-word is used with GREAT frequency, mostly as a reaction to fear, rather than as an insult.  It is violent, and believe me, the alien weaponry is bloodily effective when leveled at a  human!  Yet to some extent, I believe the film would be okay for ages 15 and above.  It's so nice to see a thoughtful action film, that I'd love to expose a kid who thinks TRANSFORMERS is the height of great moviemaking to something with a bit of a heart.

FINALLY, many people have written that this film is sly commentary on South Africa's own apartheid, or a dig a corporations like Halliburton, or even a comment on immigration.  Yes, feel free to read what you like into it...I was having too much fun to bother.",1250467200,7,7143,4.7669111654441725

3982036,2,B002SJIO5O,"""District 9"", directed by Neil Blomkamp and produced by Peter Jackson.

Present day; a gigantic alien ship appears is the sky and comes to rest over South Africa. It is determined that the visitor's intentions are not hostile, in fact they appear to be in need of help. 20 years pass and the novelty has worn off and people are beginning to wonder why the visitors are here and when they are going to leave and who is supposed to pay to maintain them. The Multi-National United (MNU) has been tasked with maintaining order and have recently been given the go ahead to move the aliens now numbering around 1.8 million from their current location to a another location and the operation is to be headed up by Wikus Van De Merwe  (Sharlto Copley). He and a team head into the slums to hand out eviction notices. All goes as expected until Wikus finds something he wasn't intended to find and the results makes Wikus' life take a turn for the worse...

District 9 is not at all what I expected from the trailer and would have to say at the very least that the advertising is misleading. It sells itself as something of an action / Sci Fi and it is this but not necessarily in the conventional since. The story focuses almost completely on the Wikus character and his dealing with the condition he develops. He eventually begins an interaction with one of the aliens but it is almost like the aliens are an ancillary part of the story. It felt like the aliens were used only to introduce the condition and so that there weaponry could be showcased. The weaponry is impressive however I found it strange that this supposed passive race of creatures had such advanced weaponry.

The Good: The performances from all the actors were all well done. The special effects for the most part were great to look at though I do find myself becoming weary of CG aliens/monsters/etc. The alien's weapons and the effects of using them were great and definitely the highpoint of the film.

The Bad: It felt like the story opened up on one giant plot hole and someone continued working with a script hole puncher. The audience is supposed to believe that after 20 years no clear reason for the alien's arrival or their long term plan for leaving has been given? None of their technology has been able to be deciphered after 20 years? The humans don't have teams working around the clock on a giant spaceship just hovering in the sky to unlock its technological secrets?

I found myself asking why the aliens needed to be served eviction notices. Also there are 1.8 million aliens living in these slums. They are given eviction notices and then within 48 hours when the main character is back in the slums there are almost no aliens to be found. Just a few scattered about here and there. Were we supposed to believe that the majority of 1.8 million aliens had been moved over 200 kilometers away within 48 hours?

To me it felt like there was a technology continuity gap as well. This alien race that has the technology to fly across the galaxy somehow doesn't have the tools or resourcefulness to erect themselves better living conditions than some bad shacks? They couldn't manage to farm or produce anything? I'm sorry but a race intelligent and motivated enough to build a massive ship is going to cross the stars so that they can live in some shacks in a desert all while scavenging through our trash and eating out pet's food? It just doesn't make since. Why wouldn't they just live on their ship and travel back and forth for supplies? I could continue to poke holes in the story but will leave it here.

Overall: It's a renter if you must see it. Don't race to the theatres for this one.",1250380800,19,3673,4.537764350453172

Sharlto's performance was great enough to pull this original story/movie from a Very Good level to a Great level.  Fantastic performance and well worth consideration at Oscar time.  The only downside of this fim is the excessive use of shakey cam.  We all know it's to help create intensity, stress, and confusion in the action sequences, but it also hides imperfections and gives viewers a migraine.

3982038,5,B002SJIO5O,"I saw this film today. And it hit all sorts of notes for me.

Sure, the 'bad' guys are unrepentantly bad. They practically twirl their mustaches, but this is a Peter Jackson film. His name might be only listed as Executive Producer, but he has literally infected every frame of this Neo Classic.

I knew what to expect from the script. No real surprises. Folks who were Grade A assholes are transformed. Other folks, those with dollar signs in their eyes, or cruelty in their souls, are headed for some heartache.

I laughed. I cringed. I screamed in horror, shock, and delight as the amazing special effects literally take you into the darkest places in the human psyche.

There are a number of digital characters. They are so seamless, so emotionally transparent, that you don't question their reality. The practical effects are particularly gruesome and believable.

Lots of kudos to whoever cast this movie. Maybe some of these folks are well known in New Zealand, but they're just human beings here. Thus keeping the documentary feel intact.

This movie is a great idea for anyone who wants to have a blast at the movies. And is something best seen at a first class theater. The sound design is probably never going to be repeated on your home theater (unless you've spent $[...]k and have no close neighbors). The visuals are disturbing and well worth the price of admission alone.

And there is deeply human story happening up on that screen.

I can't speak for everyone, but it was a very moving picture for me. It spoke to me as someone who loves good movies. Someone who loves a film that follows through on its own rules. Someone who appreciates a movie that hits the camera lens with the splattered remains of a 'bad guy' as you cheer in delight. And a person who loves that there are still good films out there.",1250380800,5,1824,4.642857142857143
3982039,4,B002SJIO5O,"This is a solid science-fiction film. It's not as earth shatteringly awesome as all the Net buzz would have you believe, but it's a solid film definitely worthy of a trip to the theater. The CGI is rock solid and the aliens (""Prawns"") are some of the most unique to come out on film in a while.

As for plot, it's Alien Nation meets The Fugitive lightly covered with a fun amount of gore-n-violence and topped with a dollop of social commentary. It blends a lot of familiar elements from other films and ends up coming out as something fairly original. The story has a great ending, and it begs for a sequel.",1250294400,5,608,4.380530973451328
3982040,5,B002SJIO5O,"Peter Jackson does it again!

In a documentary style (without the major shaky-cam of Cloverfield, thanks very much!) film from Peter (Lord of the Rings) Jackson and Neill Blomkamp. Great story with no-name (to us) actors filmed in New Zealand and South Africa. In some ways the story reminds me of Alien Nation, [Alien Nation - Ultimate Movie Collection] another tale of aliens incorporating themselves (or trying to) in human society. District 9 though is much darker!

In this tale, we find what happened to a race of aliens whose mothership somehow stopped functioning and hovered over Johannesburg, South Africa.

The humans burned their way inside and found aliens: they look like a cross between grasshoppers and lobsters and were later dubbed the degrading nickname, ""prawns."" They were brought down to District 9, which some saw as humanitarian and later degenerated into a slum.

after twenty years of inhabitation, the humans began to riot and wanted none of them. The parallels with the Prawns' fate and the now-defunct apartheid in South Africa are very clear, but Jackson and Blomkamp don't beat you over the head with it.

The aliens are indeed disgusting. Some forage, some try to get by, and some even engage in sex with prostitutes, which we are fortunate not to witness.

Our protagonist, Wikus, the son-in-law of a prominent administrator for MNU (Multi National United), is a clueless guy who is put in charge of moving the aliens out of District 9 and move them to another internment camp in District 10.

He is clueless and at times heartless, as when he sets an alien egg pod building on fire and gleefully tells the film crew that the popping you hear are the alien babies dying, and ""it sounds just like popcorn""! Geesh...

During his clueless tour through District 9, he gets infected by an alien liquid that the Prawns have been secretly creating over the last twenty years to power their command module, which is buried beneath on of the ghetto shacks.

MNU sees Wikus as a biological weapon and wish to ""harvest"" him. Wikus himself becomes hunted and now knows what the Prawns feel. A particularly poignant scene is where one of the Prawns, ""Christopher"" discovers his race is being used for experimentation -- he slumps in a very human gesture over one of his charcoaled comrades. Quite intense.

The last third of the movie is more of a plain action/adventure shoot-em-up and though exciting (humans go *splat!*) does not end as I would like. The ending does make one ponder, however.

I read that District 9"" is based on 29-year-old co-writer/director Neill Blomkamp's youth in South Africa during apartheid, influenced by the real former inner-city District 6 in Cape Town.

Fingernails falling out, black blood and a weapon that can gather bullets and fire them back are some of the highlights.

Highly recommended!

3982042,5,B002SJIO5O,"No name director. No name actors and actresses. A measly $30 million budget. A producer (Peter Jackson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000X9FLKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>) who's most recent film disaster -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Kong/dp/B001KZVQJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Kong</a>(remake) - didn't instill much confidence. All of these strikes were lined up, ready to kick DISTRICT 9 to the curb. But did they?

The easy and obvious answer is ""no."" In fact, I dare say that this is probably one of the best science fiction films to emerge from Hollywood in the last decade. Yes, even better than the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B001AVCFK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>&nbsp;redux. Although comparing this film to STAR TREK is like comparing apples and apple peels.

Filmed with the ever-popular hand-held cameras, DISTRICT 9 starts out slow, feeling very much like another ""aliens stranded on Earth film,""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Nation/dp/B000059HAD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Nation</a>(1988). But DISTRICT 9 takes a few more twists and turns. Where ALIEN NATION had the tough-cop grudgingly becoming friends with the alien, DISTRICT 9 doesn't really seem to have a protagonist. Everyone and everything is out for themselves.

And the film starts off showing us Wikus Van De Merwe (complete unknown Sharlto Copley) as he gets assigned as the lead agent in Johannesburg, South Africa to move a group of one-million-plus insectoid-like aliens from a slum to ""a nicer"" slum (district 10). Wikus is a very bubbly guy but as soon as he moves into District 9 with his security force, things get ugly. Prostitution, murder, weapons, and every crime known to man or alien takes place here, and Wikus is smack in the middle of it. But when he gets exposed to an alien liquid, strange things start to happen.

Wikus is soon the center of attention for all the factions warring inside and outside the district. His own agency wants to dissect him. A slum-lord wants to cut him up and eat him. And the Prawns (as the aliens are called because they look like prawns), could care less about him as long as he doesn't bother them. But bother them he must as Wikus takes to the road, hoping to find something resembling a friend.

I'm not going to give much away here, simply because I don't want to spoil any of this amazing film. And it is amazing. The film starts out pretty slowly, and I was beginning to worry that this was going to be another fanfare and fizzle sci-fi show. But the film gradually engages the audience by getting us in tight with Wikus, and an alien and his son. There are some shoot `em up spectacles that will make the action junkies out there drool. And for those who want a really, really great story with believable characters, well, there's that too. You often hear that a great movie MUST start with a great script, and DISTRICT 9 was blessed with that. But it wasn't blessed with any star power or a large budget. Which, apparently, was also a blessing.",1250294400,3,3270,5.611336032388664
3982043,5,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is not for the weak at heart or the casual viewer. It is a powerful movie that should be seen for what it is; a glimpse at true human nature. The ""aliens"" are just a metaphor for any race of people be it indians, black, jewish, middle eastern,... whoever is the escape goat of the minute. The director does a wonderful job of first displaying the welfare/imigration department as working for the ""benefit"" of the alien. However, the alien isn't really smart enough to know what is good for them so we are going to have to use some force. Then a racist slur is dressed up (Prawn) along with some twiking of what humans would consider ""crazy"" behavior and we have groomed our follower/audience.
The audience was completely quite during this film. I really wonder how many people got the message of this film? I hope is was a lot. Definately worth going to see and I will purchace the DVD. As far a a sequel I hope that it's something that has an answer for all of us. Because leaving the theater I overheard several young boys people say there wasn't enough fighting.

3982044,4,B002SJIO5O,"After reading all the glowing reviews I expected one of the greatest Sci-Fi films in years. While District 9 is truly interesting and very unique, I don't quite think it's a masterpiece. It is good, very good at that. The visual effects are very well done thanks to Peter Jackson's Weta Digital involvement. The movie has almost a documentary look and feel most of the time, much like Cloverfield, but without all the shakey camera moments. The sense of realism really adds to the experience here. This is probably what would happen if a disgusting looking alien species happened to breakdown on our planet. There are also some great action scenes, especially towards the end. Body parts fly left and right as the alien weapons inflict some massive damage. The amount of gore surprised me and I loved every second of it. By the way, the robotic mech suit at the end would even make Iron Man jealous. If you're sick of mindless action flicks like Transformers: Revenge of th Fallen or G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, District 9 will please your brain as well as your eyes.",1250294400,3,1068,4.656084656084656
3982045,5,B002SJIO5O,"District 9 is nothing short of a masterpiece. A taught, original and superbly paced story that maximizes it's modest budget and demonstrates that action/SciFi movies can be so much more than just explosions and the destruction of landmarks. The achievement is all the more impressive when you realize this film was really made by novices. Sharlto Copley stars in his first film role (literally FIRST) and gives a solid performance showing range, depth and authenticity that you'd expect from a veteran of stage and screen. Even more impressively Neil Blomkamp is directing his first feature film (he also cowrote the screenplay) as well and it's simply hard to fathom that fact when you see how well structured, paced and shot this film is. Despite having a small $30mil budget the effects in this film are superb. The film flies through exposition at breakneck speed that's a little dizzying at first and you wonder why they are going so fast -- until you get to the unforgettable third act of this film that is absolutely thrilling, edge of your seat excitement. The action is not just for action sake either. The film does a great job of getting you emotionally connected and invested in the well being of the characters.

The film is presented in a documentary style format that utilizes handheld camera shots augmented by cable newscast type coverage that helps the viewer get immersed in the unfolding drama. There are political undertones of segregation, immigration, police brutality, genocide and human rights but the movie handles them subtly and this does not come across in a heavy handed or preachy way. At it's core this is a sci fi action film anchored by a dramatic story that will have your head spinning and your hands clenched as the third act unfolds.

I saw this movie at a crowded opening night showing and was struck by how quiet the audience was during the movie. It was the quietest, most intensely focused audience I've been a member of in years. I credit that to the pacing of the film and the efficiency with which the story is told. There are no wasted moments of this film. No scenes that could have been cut. No special effects just for the sake of special effects (yeah, I'm talking to you Michael Bay). I believe that District 9 will become a classic film in the genre that generations from now will hold up and be a must see",1250294400,2,2358,4.707021791767555

2) Thought-provoking themes: Animal testing, racism and xenophobia, loyalties, the reach of big corporations, questions of humanity...and how do we treat others who look differently from us?

3) High quality production: No cheesy aliens-- it's entirely believable and fresh. The integration of the aliens and space ship(s) in the scenes are seamless, as well as the fight scenes.

One negative:  I was disappointed only by the acting of the father-in-law.
