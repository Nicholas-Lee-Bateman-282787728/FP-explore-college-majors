1558662,5,B00005JP8O,"Okay, just watched the movie and am utterly disgusted by the fact that they were trying to market this as another ""grudge"" type movie which is perhaps one of the main reasons why it didn't do so well at the box office.

The only similarity between ""the grudge"" and this movie is that they both feature Sarah Michelle Gellar in the lead role. The way the movie was promoted before it's release with respect to the trailer as well as the poster fooled quite a number of people including myself (who is a die-hard Gellar fan) into thinking that this was going to be yet another ""ghostly cheap scare"" flick.

It wasn't until today that I had the chance to view the movie and realized that this movie was wrongly promoted and what a great movie it truly is. It has a solid plot backed by substantial performance from Sarah Michelle Gellar and Peter O'Brien. The chemistry between the two is undeniable and really did carry the movie far.

Important thing to know is that I didn't sit through the film hiding behind a cushion hence proving my point that this isn't some random ""ghostly cheap scare movie"". In fact they kept the annoying ""jump out of nowhere and scare the pants off you"" scenes to a minimum and the ones they have wasn't that scary either.

Yes, for the first twenty minutes of the film, it was difficult to follow due to the pacing of the film. However, as the movie progresses the pieces started to fit together and the final scene whereby they reveled how the connection between Joanna and terry's lover was established was truly emotional and provided a satisfying finish to the film.

If you're looking to scare yourself silly go get ""the grudge"" DVD but if you are looking for something that has depth with actual storylines, this movie is for you.

Bottom line, this movie has potential but this potential was sadly trampled by the tactless marketing.",1172275200,8,1868,4.594594594594595
1558663,5,B00005JP8O,"Definitely one of the best horror/supernatural thrillers I've seen.  On the edge of my seat.  Chills the entire time.  Not to mention that there's a great story in there too.  Multi-layered, cool ending.  Even Sarah Michelle Gellar was good and to be honest I'm not a huge fan generally.  But if you like a movie that will keep you guessing and scare the hell out of you, it's a great ride, definitely worth a watch.",1171929600,4,416,4.48
1558664,1,B00005JP8O,"This film is deceptive. It is packaged as if it is similar to The Ring or The Grudge or another of those stunning Japanese horror films, but it is nothing of the sort. This film belongs to the chiller/thriller genre of dead person trying to contact the living to help them find the murderer. Yawn. This plot has been played to death in other films such as What Lies Beneath, The Ring, Dark Water etc etc etc. It really has become terribly cliched. At least in films like The Ring, the visual effects and the scares are frequent and good. In this offering, there are little or no special effects. The film has a surreal effect which is very very annoying as nothing is explained. Sarah Michelle Gellar literally sleepwalks her way through the role. It's a bad film in all honesty. A mind numbing bore from start to finish. They could have edited it down to 30 minutes from its 85 minutes and not have lost a jot of the storyline or what flimsy plot that there is. There are little or no scares either.

This film probably spells the end of Sarah Michelle Gellar. She has blown it big time after the success of The Grudge. I'm afraid it's back to teen chick flicks and comedies. She cannot cut it in this genre, especially with such a bad choice of film as this. I feel really really annoyed now. I wasted 85 minutes of my life on this rubbish. I could have done something much more worthwhile like wash the cat instead...",1171929600,4,1420,4.378787878787879
1558665,5,B00005JP8O,I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS GREAT.  IT WAS VERY WELL ACTED.  I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY TO ANYONE WHO LIKE DARK SUSPENSE MOVIES.,1171584000,,119,4.363636363636363
1558666,3,B00005JP8O,"Good movie overall. Like mentioned, it is good to see a ""horror"" movie that is not about a masked killer walking and somehow catches up to the girl whos running for her life.

The good parts:

-Plot. Well, this can either be in the good or bad. It's obvious from the beginning of the movie that this little girl is going to grow up and try to find out something that happened to her when she was little. Reliving the attempted murder of a different woman is not really an incredibly unique plot.

-Few actors. It was good to not see 15 different actors without a story behind them. It focuses on a couple characters and builds the plot around them.

-Good length. It doesnt last 2 hours. It's slow at first but it gains a little speed afterwards.

The bad things:

-Resolution. Some parts are left a little hazy. Almost everything is resolved and put into place, but there are some parts which leave you thinking ""now how does that fit in?""...if you really don't pay attention to every single detail it might slip, but if you do, you'll catch that some things are iffy.

-Dull beginning. It is a little hard to get interested at the beginning of the movie. Nothing starts falling into place until much later on.

Overall an ok movie. So-so acting and an ok plot. I recommend it, but its a movie that won't keep you thinking about it for long.",1166140800,,1342,4.4048582995951415
1558667,1,B00005JP8O,"Boring, pretentious and completely lacking vision.  That pretty much sums up the snoozefest that is ""The Return.""  This movie doesn't know what it wants to be.

The cinematography is weak with the colors being almost completely washed out at times.  The rest of the images are bleak and dreary.  Sarah Michelle Gellar and Peter O'Brien had NO chemistry whatsoever.  I also had a very hard time believe Sarah Michelle Gellar to be this no-nonsense saleswoman.

The writing and the pacing are weak.  The producers knew this movie would bomb, hence the numerous release delays which ultimately was strategically planned to shamelessly ride on the coattails of ""The Grudge 2.""

Did I also mention the poster artwork is a complete rip-off from that of ""The Skeleton Key?""  This movie is unimaginative and will soon be forgotten by cinemagoers.",1165276800,5,838,5.0510948905109485
1558668,3,B00005JP8O,"This review has plot spoilers:

 ""The  Return"" concerns a young woman, Joanna Mills, who is driven by unexplained memories to re-enact, and ultimately to avenge, another woman's violent death.  The link between Joanna and the dead woman is revealed to be an automobile accident years before in which the dying woman was in one car and Joanna, as a child, in the other.  An alternate ending included on the DVD release explicitly supports the notion that Joanna is the reincarnation of the dead victim.  In the original, theatrical ending Joanna's relation to the dead woman is left unresolved.  In the final scene a silent Joanna seems to have reached an inner understanding, but what that is the viewer is not told.  The ambiguity of the original ending is more interesting, if less susceptible of easy explanation.

The film is a failure.  The pared down 85 minute run time suggests a desperate attempt to makes less become more, but it does no good to cut when what's left isn't any better.  There is nothing new in this move: not one line of dialogue, not one plot device, not one camera angle, not one dumbed down, faintly Buddhist idea. (In fact, the film's only plausible claim to Eastern religiosity is that it is itself the reincarnation of a half dozen better movies.) Direction is alert and competent but derivative.  The writing is mundane.  On the plus side is a somewhat compelling score, whose moodiness matches that of the film.  For reasons hard to explain, the whole thing does work somewhat better on DVD than in the theater.  Perhaps a film so small in so many ways belongs on the small screen.

Sarah Michelle Gellar, however, shines, turning in a captivating performance in this uncaptivating film.  This is not a breakthrough role for her, or one in which her talents are stretched, even modestly. But she shows once again that she can hold attention in a feature film, if that needed showing, and not just by her beauty, though she is movingly beautiful here despite the film's washed out color and her character's dreary persona. Her performance is a hint of the career she is seeking to carve out for herself, in which she will perhaps become the actress we know she can be, one whose performances deepen our lives. There are several films that are NOT supernatural thrillers or horror films that she has chosen intelligently and rather courageously and that should be in theaters this year. It may not be ""Southland Tales"", but perhaps it will be ""Air I Breathe"" or ""Girl's Guide"" or one of her other gutsy choices that will demonstrate the full scope of her talents in a movie worth watching. The time has come for her to slay the ghost of Buffy (great as that show was) once and for all, and to abandon supernatural thrillers, especially ones as dull as this one.  The upcoming ""Addicted"" shows, though, that she has not shaken the genre quite yet.",1163462400,3,2877,4.72
1558669,5,B00005JP8O,"I have read several reviews from different sites, claiming that this film was confusing. Why it is confusing to people completely eludes me, because the end of the film explains everything perfectly. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

The film starts at an amusement park. A father (Sam Shepherd) and his daughter Joanna have just been in a car accident. Almost immediately, the girl begins acting strangely, seeing a mysterious man who isn't there. All he wants to do is talk to her. This may seem bizarre at first, but it gives you the first clue to an unfolding story about a woman running from her past.

As an adult, Joanna (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is a salesperson. She likes her job because it keeps her ahead of whatever evil seems to be chasing her. Even though she has sworn off territory in Texas, she changes her mind. This trip brings her into contact with an old friend and her father. The longer she remains in Texas, the more her strange ""visions"" or dreams take hold of her. She eventually finds herself pulled to La Salle, Texas, where she encounters a man whose wife was murdered years before.

I won't reveal the ending, but suffice it to say that the reason some viewers may be having trouble deciphering this film is because it is rooted in Eastern religion. Life isn't linear, but cyclical.

I found the film to be deeply moving. Sure, the pacing is languid like the Texas heat, but it allows the story to unfold. There also isn't a heavy metal soundtrack and young photo-perfect pin-ups crying while some masked madman tortures and then kills them.

Horror film fanatics seem to fall into two camps: those who like axe wielding maniacs and those who like atmospheric ghost stories. I prefer the latter. To be honest, my stomach was in knots throughout ""The Return,"" because the director creates an undeniable sense of doom.

If you enjoy Japanese or Korean horror films - heavy on atmosphere and unsettling imagery - you'll enjoy ""The Return."" If your cup of tea is ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", you'll do yourself a favor and skip this one.",1163289600,48,2060,4.692520775623269
1558670,3,B00005JP8O,"""The Return"" is the kind of supernatural thriller you have to force yourself to sit through. Already this isn't a good sign. There were a couple of moments when I felt ready to leave the theater, not because the content was disturbing, but because the plot was needlessly confusing. The first hour of this film made absolutely no sense; it drifted from one scene to the next with nothing stringing them together. It was like watching the reedited fragments of various ghost stories. It's a good thing the ending connected most of the missing pieces by validating the previous scenes. I can say with complete honesty that I didn't leave the theater feeling as if I had been ripped off (not completely, anyway); what started out as a complete mess ended up as a definite story.

Unfortunately, this doesn't make the film worth recommending. Despite the fact that many of the plot's loose ends were eventually tied up, I still felt that it went a long way for very little. It vaguely resembles a ghost story, one in which otherworldly powers are used on a living person in order to warn and/or help another living person. Furthermore, the characters are defined by cliches so well established that one wonders how the story would survive on its own. You won't find anything original or inspiring about ""The Return,"" which I suppose wouldn't have been so bad had the filmmakers attempted to reinterpret some aspect of the genre. Then again, that may be asking too much, especially when you consider how successful many of the more formulaic ghost films have been.

Apparently, the filmmakers tried to poke the audience along by presenting them with small snippets of information, hopefully enough snippets to peak their interest. This method has worked before in other such films, but it didn't work too well with this one. I certainly wish it had; it would have made the initial randomness seem more like an opportunity for us to use our heads as opposed to a self-serving excuse for cryptic imagery. Sarah Michelle Gellar--fresh from her appearance in last month's ""The Grudge 2""--plays Joanna Mills, a young businesswoman who, for as yet unknown reasons, has terrible visions of a man and a murdered woman. It would seem that she's had them ever since she was a little girl, as first seen during the opening flashback sequence of her and her father, Ed (Sam Shepard), at a local carnival.

In present day, she's an ambitious businesswoman working for an oil company based in St. Louis. One day, she's given the opportunity to make a sale in her home state of Texas, specifically in a town called Salle. It's intriguing that she made this decision; before this job opportunity, she had never considered stepping foot into that city. This is because she's had visions of it, much like those of the unknown man and woman. What's worse, her visions force her into acts of self-mutilation, such as cutting into her leg or forehead. Why, I'm not exactly sure; the connections are never fully developed, even by the end of the film. I did get the sense that the filmmakers tried to make the connection crystal clear; because Joanna left Texas under dubious circumstances, and because her family and friends have remained there, tension exists between everyone involved.

But the idea never got off the ground, and that only made the ensuing mystery unnecessarily confusing. Upon entering Salle, Joanna checks into a drab hotel/slaughterhouse (a combination only possible in a supernatural thriller). She then investigates an unnamed local bar, the same one she's been having visions of lately. It would seem that the visions are getting more and more frequent, and for some reason, they all connect with her personally. She struggles to find out why, especially when loner Terry Stahl (Peter O'Brien) comes into the picture. He introduces himself by saving her from her jealous coworker, Kurt (Adam Scott). While Joanna was grateful for Stahl's help, the locals respond with utter disdain. His girlfriend, Annie (Erinn Allison), had been murdered some years earlier, and everyone is convinced that he committed the crime.

Whether or not he did, I dare not say. What I do dare say is that the relationship between him and Joanna is growing, as are her visions, which are gradually becoming more understandable. Consider the fact that she had painted several seahorse pictures as a child; is it any coincidence that Annie had painted something very similar on the inside wall of her barn? Of course it isn't, and neither is the fact that other such visions are leading up to the revelation of Annie's killer. But the question remains: why is Joanna involved at all? Furthermore, why has she been plagued with these mental images for the past fifteen years? How is she to know what to do if she acts on her instincts?

Interestingly enough, these are the exact same questions that ran through my head. Even when everything is explained at the end of the film, an adequate reason for her involvement remains elusive. I didn't feel as if anything had been gained by it, and I should think nothing much would have been lost without her. This is a bad thing; Joanna was created as a heroine figure, yet she's included in a story that doesn't really need one. I say this because the ultimate purpose of ""The Return"" is to give a grandiose message about something that's relatively miniscule. To be perfectly honest, there was no reason for this story to be told at all; while it wasn't particularly bad, it's still a mere blip on the cinematic radar, one that hardly deserves any special attention. Too bad for Sarah Michelle Gellar; that's what she gets for starring in two ghost movies released less than a month apart.",1163116800,4,5706,4.841188524590164

1558794,3,B00005JP8O,"The Return (Asif Kapadia, 2006)

Everyone loves a good mystery. Unless, that is, it's marketed like a horror film. Sarah Michelle Gellar was coming off the commercial successes of The Grudge and The Grudge 2, so I guess someone in The Return's marketing department decided hey, we should come up with a poster that will draw the Grudge crowd.  Bad idea. The movie was excoriated by the press (16% at Rotten Tomatoes critical) and the public (32% RT public, 4.8 at IMDB) alike. I...didn't think it was all that bad. It wasn't anything new, but we're talking about Hollywood here. What is?

Kapadia (Senna) and screenwriter Adam Sussman, turning in his first feature, give us the story of Joanna Mills (Gellar), a saleswoman who heads back to rural Texas, where she grew up, to try and score some business for the shipping company she works for. When she gets back near where she grew up, she starts seeing things that are...out of the ordinary. We know from the opening scene, which takes place when Joanna is young, that she was emotionally unstable as a child thanks to a terrifying car accident, and we can assume the visions she sees have to do with that; she beings to put together the events of that night with some help from a local, Terry Stahl (X-Men Origins: Wolverine's Peter O'Brien), who is embroiled in a mystery of his own; the rest of the town he lives in believes he killed his wife Annie (Fast Food Nation's Erinn Allison). He proclaims his innocence. Hey, two mysteries are better than oneand the more Joanna is drawn into Terry's story, the more she begins to feel as if she were somehow related to it.

Sure, it's contrived, and some of it is downright ridiculous, but it's not like you haven't seen this done worse dozens of times. (Hundreds, if you watch Lifetime or Hallmark.) You'll get a lot more out of it, I think, if you just dispense with the supernatural aspect of the movie altogether (that's the most contrived part) and just think of it as a straight mystery. It works that way, and it works well enough to kill and hour and a half with if you just want to turn your brain off and have a good time. Not timeless cinema by any means, but not as bad as you probably heard it was. ** ",1401926400,,2214,4.497512437810945

I don't recall ever seeing Peter O'Brien in anything before and I was very impressed with his acting, as well.  He had an angry intensity that was barely subdued just under the surface. I hope to see him again.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the cinematography was truly awesome and effective.  I loved the mood set by all the different lighting techniques and the sepia tones in much of the movie. I had no trouble following the story and I  was intrigued from start to finish.

A horror movie that stars Sarah Michelle Gellar screams teen flick, I know, I know. But to be honest this s well made pretty good little thriller/ghostly flick that is good for a rental. To be honest when this first came out I had no interest in seeing it. For the trailer I could just tell I wasn't about it. But every one in a while we all still meet up and watch a flick at my Grandmother's house when some of us can make it. She loves ghost, horror, thrillers, and suspense movies like crazy.

Joanna Mills is having trouble at work since she is having visions where she can see a woman being murdered. She takes these visions on the road with her to a Texas town where the answers to her questions may or may not be answered. This town has everything she has been seeing in her visions. From the settings all the way to the people she is seeing. And even people from her past may or may not show up.

This was surprisingly better than I thought it would be, my own fault I guess. I thought with the star here and just the look of the thing it would be, well not so good. To my surprise it is really well done and the atmosphere of the film is great. Still it is not a classic and you should know that right now. The acting is good but there is just that special something missing. It could be that it feels like we may have seen this flick before, or at least some like it.

Sarah Michelle Gellar is well cast here and really fits the role well, in fact every one is well cast here. Like I said it is kinda like you have seen this movie before. I do like that this is not you typical horror flick from the past couple of years. This really was not made for the teen audience, thank goodness for that. Not to say that those films are all bad because some are actually good. Any way this is a good movie that I would recommend as a rental first.",1318118400,,1860,4.059945504087193
1558884,3,B00005JP8O,"There's more than enough reviews for this film, but I will add to them by saying that while this film isn't incredible, it's also not a terrible film either.

The whole film has this dreary autumn vibe to it, as a woman haunted by visions of her past that she doesn't quite remember seeks out to find what really happened in the small town of La Salle, TX (which, ironically, is a very small non-governmental community that many people don't know much about).

""The Return"" of course suffers from the usual repetitiveness and cringe factor that most modern ""horror"" movies suffer from, i.e. static on the radio hearing voices, faces in the mirror, screams in the dark...all that stuff that almost every horror film in the past 15 years has incorporated and overdone. (It's been done so much, in fact, that when watching a horror film I give uber kudos if it doesn't happen and instead incorporates something original.)

The plot twist is very nice, as is the alternate ending (although I think they cut it so that Terry didn't appear old enough to be the girl's father, which might have been creepy considering their mini make-out session at the end of the alternate ending).

Ultimately I was left desiring more. If the film had not omitted the deleted scenes, it would have been a much more enjoyable movie. The omitted scenes provided a maturity and a deeper insight and texture to the life of the character and the thickness of the plot. It would have made the movie so much better, but instead they cut it down to some cheap thriller with no texture. Doesn't that make you angry?

Oh well. Am I angry I spent $1 for a rental? Nah. I just wouldn't spend money to own it.

Again, I'm being candid. If they left the deleted scenes in the movie, it would have been a much better film. More than the cost of admission.

My advice is, if you can find it for a cheap rental (Redbox, Mr. Movies), rent it some night. If you have nothing to do it will fill up your time quite nicely. Otherwise, skip it.",1298419200,,1999,4.490358126721763
1558885,3,B00005JP8O,"From what I have read this movie is suppose to be a supernatural thriller; however, I didn't find it very thrilling.  JoAnna gets flashes of a life that isn't hers and tries to find out why and ends up solving a murder.  However, the way the plot unfolded left me bored and arguing with my friend about fast forwarding thru it.  I kept hoping it would pick up the pace; but it never really did.  The flashes she gets are from a woman's life about 15 years ago (or something close to that) and when she finds the murderer it was by complete accident...since the flashes are from so long ago she doesn't even recognize him when she comes face to face with him.  JoAnna also finds the murder weapon but how did she know to look there...oh yea cuz she recognized the car but where she found it on the car is not where I would think one would hide it.  So due to the slow pace and some unexplained and unreasonable actions it is an ok movie if there is nothing else on but not one I would recommend if you want creepy, supernatural, edge of your seat type story line.",1295827200,,1062,4.206896551724138

This is not a typical horror movie. It is a drama with supernatural elements. And as such, it succeeds admirably.
Think of it as going out on a dark night alone then hearing, in the distance, a long mournful wail. It frightens but at the same time, one detects great sadness in the sound.

We do not know if the trauma to her head has given her visions of a man who is constantly stalking her that no one else sees. And when he appears, she actually hurts herself. But then, except for the damage she has done to herself, all is back to normal.

We flash forward to her adult life and getting reading to head home on business. But her true motive is to try and get some answers to her disturbing visions or memories. And as she enters her home area she starts to experience these episodes in increase frequency. The more visions or memories we see the closer we start to understand what is transpiring. And make no mistake; this is a mystery that you can try to solve before the answer is shown to you at the climax of the film.

I was pleased to see a true suspense movie that has an eerie feeling that makes you feel uneasy with no blood and gore that is so popular today. The use of shadows to enhance the suspense is reminiscent from the Alfred Hitchcock's methods. As another reviewer mentioned, Sarah Michelle Gellar carries the movie well.

As part of her job, she travels to Texas, where the flashbacks become more frequent and turn into a strong feeling of deja vu. Did she really witness a woman's murder and is someone now trying to kill her?

Pity also the viewer of this movie. As I saw this movie, I too was overwhelmed by a strong feeling of deja vu. I was certain that I had seen this film before, and yet, I can assure you, I hadn't. Perhaps it was under a different title, like, say ""A Stir of Echoes""?

""The Return"" is neither original, nor is it a well-made film. For the most part, this film is a one-woman show and Gellar is not a strong enough actor to pull this off. This film merely serves to demonstrate why she has never managed to rise above B-grade horror movies. The story is often hard to follow and the payoff at the end is not adequate to compensate the viewer for the confusion that they are forced to experience.

Right away, I wanted to see this movie because Sarah Michelle Gellar stars in it. That fact alone is worth one star. On the positive side, the actors in this movie a very good. Gellar plays a salesperson who visits Texas and suddenly becomes overwhelmed with visions about a murdered woman. The spirit of this murdered woman seems to manifest itself within Gellar's visions.
On the negative side, the movie fails to actually ""show"" the spirit. In addition, there are many unecessary long dull scenes which should not have been included in the movie. Director Asif Kapadia tries too much to build suspense but fails to ever ""shock"" the audience with any surprises during the movie. The DVD itself does offer some alternate scenes that were deleted and it also offers a rather interesting alternate ending.
During most of this movie, the camera would languish and focus on the ground or a road for what seems to be minutes at a time. Then, nothing. No surprises, no shocks. This movie is very, very, dull.
I believe the director tries to emulate some Japenese horror movies which tend to have a ""dream like"" setting, but, unfortunately, Asif Kapadia spends too much time shooting dull and boring camera angles and not nearly enough time shooting the exciting scenes that made Sarah Michelle Gellar popular in the first place.
In conclusion, the actors are great. However, the writers and director Asif Kapadia fail miserably to deliver enough action in this movie.
I rate this movie three stars only because Sarah Michelle Gellar stars in it and due to the supporting cast. Basically, this is a movie with good actors and a so-so director who does not not create enough suspense and action to keep most of the viewing audience interested.

Everything's so dreary it's almost like the film is in black and white.  While Sarah Michelle Gellar is a great actress and really fits the roll for any kind of suspense or horror storyline (not to mention one of the hottest women I've ever seen) something was missing in this movie.

The main story was really not that interesting, or intense.  It was good enough to keep me watching, but in the end, I'd rather see the Ring or the Grudge again.  Watching Sarah Michelle explore a nearly deserted town for an hour and a half wasn't as scary as it probably sounds.

She's basically going around trying to find clues about a murder, and while this is happening, strange things start to happen to Sarah.  Throughout the film, she sees things that aren't really there.  While that's not really the problem I have with the movie, it's not as suspenseful as I had hoped.  I can't figure out why either.

Most of the time thrillers such as this one have a complex story that makes me want to come back and see it again.  However, the plot was so obvious in this film, I don't know if I will return (no pun intended) to it again any time soon.

Fastforward to the present. Joannna is an upwardly mobile adult in sales, constantly on the road and the fast track to success. She makes a business trip in another city and  sees an old friend. While there, she has a series of strange visions and blacks out. Her friend finds her later, passed out on the bathroom floor with a large self-inflicted wound on her forearm.

While trying to make sense of this disturbing behavior and the visions, Joanna ends up in La Salle, Texas. In La Salle, she finds the same buildings and places that she has already seen in her visions, giving her an unsettling sense of deja vu.

I won't reveal anymore, but THE RETURN is well worth your time. It is 90 minutes of suspense, the supernatural and ultimately, a ghostly love story that defies time. The theatical ending was good, but check out the alternate ending on the DVD special features.

As some have remarked, this is not unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense</a>, but that movie's twist was propelled by the plot, and the meat of the movie had enough drama to keep less astute viewers interested.  ""The Return,"" on the other hand, spends ninety minutes making very little sense at all and taking its sweet time to do so.

An oddly aged Sarah Michelle Gellar plays our lead, the tormented Joanna Mills.  Gellar is filmed in harsh, unflattering light and spends much of the film looking confused (and rightfully so).  It turns out that the decision to frame her in such ashen tones was deliberate and, given the movie's twist, well-advised.  Not so smart was the decision to have her walk around in an ineffectual daze while she sees people who aren't there, revisits locales she's never seen before (?), and watches her eye color flicker from brown to blue.  Gellar's Joanna is hardly there at all.

Also absent in the film are any elements of suspense or tension.  The story tries to use things like an aggressively lecherous coworker (the shrew-faced Adam Scott) and a repeated bar from Patsy Cline's ""Sweet Dreams"" to spur the suspense.  It's hard, though, to prickle the spine when a viewer has no idea what exactly they're supposed to be afraid of.

Movies with the requisite twist only really work when the audience is led to believe something erroneous and then has that misconception yanked out from under them.  ""The Return"" leads you to believe nothing, asking instead that the well-executed ambience be enough reason to stick with the script's senselessness in the hopes that the pay-off will be enough to justify over an hour of quiet confusion.

The pay-off, to be clear, is well-done.  It brings to the story a cohesiveness that is almost enjoyable.  It is the sort of ""Ohhhhh!"" moment that gives meaning to every mystifying element that came before it.  The story, in light of this, is well-written.

But it is not well-done.  The movie is only good in retrospect, but not from front-to-back.  The presence of an always-excellent Sam Shepard and the excellent closure of the conclusion don't make up for the mind-numbing (and confusing) clap-trap that makes up 95% of the viewing experience.

It just doesn't have enough creep to make it suspense, but it doesn't really have enough meat to be a drama. With that, it's almost like two half movies that don't really add up to anything great.

The plot doesn't really make a lot of sense, but of course some are going to claim that you just ""don't get it"" if you don't like the plot. It's not a strong plot, and there are major holes. Still, it's interesting, and it's something that we haven't seen over and over and over.

It is well shot, and has a nice feel throughout. The creepiest part of it is the look, which is much appreciated.

My overall grade would be a 2.5 for this movie, but I rounded up because I think this movie is too harshly criticized. It's no Friday Night Watch a Scary Movie with your Friends, but this will appeal to certain people -- and for that, it's worth it.",1176595200,5,1693,4.294670846394984
1559179,2,B00005JP8O,"Ok, so I'm a half hour into the movie, and I'm falling asleep here on my couch. I rented ""The Return"" as part of a usual Saturday horror-film fest. The PG-13 rating was the first thing that caught my attention...however, there have been a few good PG 13 horror films, at least in my opinion (What Lies Beneath, The Ring), but they are somewhat of a rarity. I guess I should have figured that this one staring Sarah Michelle Gellar probably wouldn't stand the test of taste. So what's missing?

A good horror film is like a good speech, book, article....what not. You have an introduction, a body and a conclusion. Well, we start off with an introduction. It was good, nice set-up, good acting, great environment. However, the introduction never seems to end. When you're 45 minutes into the film and so far all you've seen were a few flashy images, loud smash cuts, and eerie music, as the main character walks around in circles, it's just time to start something new. The scariest part had to be when I ran out of ice cream! In element we've gone from horror film to drama, with little to no plot advancement. Then we start a romance which seems way out of character to me for a career obsessed traveling sales-woman. If anything, this movie is more of a drama about strange stalkers who all seem to specifically go after Sarah (well, she is hott...).

Reality: The film seems pretty real, all except for one spot where she reaches for a knife on the stairs after being cornered, yet she caries a switchblade in her boot...what?? Yet the rest of the film seems to be pretty realistic and the characters act somewhat reasonable.

Plot: Ok, so it's not very intriguing. The story is a drama, not a horror film. Don't expect to be scared, but you'll probably jump at a few of the smash-cuts. Most of the plot carries Sarah around as she tries to figure out her past and why she's connected to this small Texas town. The creators gave a bit too much away too early and you figure most everything out before the third act. Nothing new, nothing interesting....it's just as it is. There's an interesting final twist at the end, but that's going to just about cover it. The final scene is just a simple fade to black. Everything comes together, and all is as it should be in the world.

Effects: Yeah, um...virtually, there are no effects. So if you're looking for monsters, blood, gore, that sort of thing, don't rent this guy. There are a few vehicle wrecks which were pretty exciting, but that's about all the icing on this cake...

Film elements; Acting, camera, lighting, sound, music....the rest is all about what you'd expect from a common drama. It's all placed together pretty well in a nice coherent manner. It's definitely a budgeted film, and lives up to hollywood standards by all means. Definitely technically sounds. A slight desaturated color scheme spills over the film's ""style,"" and some strange quick zoom in, blur, quick zoom out type camera work adds to it. I'm not sure I particularly enjoyed this, but it's something I haven't seen to often.

All-in-all, it's you average film, nothing new, nothing exciting, but it should please the drama or thriller fans. It's definitely no horror film and will provide little excitement to the die-hard horror fan. I might rent this on a rainy day with my girlfriend, but I wouldn't add it to my collection.",1176163200,3,3361,4.640336134453782

1559184,2,B00005JP8O,"Sarah Michelle Gellar stars as a trucking company saleswoman who goes from town to town to visit potential clients. Joanna (Gellar) has been having recurring visions and waking nightmares about a woman being murdered. Guided by the visions, she goes to La Salle, Texas to seek answers about the woman and her killer who might just be after her next. We learn that Joanna and her father have been in a car accident when she was eleven years old that changed her completely. Who is the woman she sees in her visions? Is everything related?

The trailers for this film will have you think you're gearing up to watch a supernatural horror film; make no mistake, this film is a thriller, and not a horror film. The first half-hour is extremely slow-paced and quite uninteresting. I just couldn't get into this movie. As the story unfolds, I became curious to see how things would turn out, desperately hoping there was more going on than what was on the surface. Sadly, there wasn't much behind the shell of this film. The twist ending disappointed me terribly. Go in the special features on the DVD and watch the alternate ending, which is, in my opinion, a much more satisfying ending. By changing a few details in the plot, that ending could've been used and would definitely have been a more powerful way to finish the film.

On the up side, the director shows promise with stylish compositions, shaky cam shots that put you in the middle of the action (and manage to make you jump once or twice). Gellar gives a subdued performance appropriate for the part. The supporting cast is also effective in their roles. The score was subtle, the cinematography made you feel Texas in all its glorious heat and Joanna's nightmares at their seedy best.

If you're looking for a horror film, look elsewhere. If you're a fan of Gellar, you might enjoy it more than I did. Other than that, I can't recommend this film; it just didn't make the passing grade in my book.",1175385600,,1955,4.628242074927954
1559185,1,B00005JP8O,"How can so many people rate this as a good movie?!?!?

It was downright horrible. It took over thirty minutes for any action to take place, if you want to consider her continuously walking to a bar as some action. Then a co-worker tries something with her, mind you, a CO-WORKER, whom she WORKS WITH. That just seemed like someone threw that scene in to show people that the main hero can fight.

The characters seem to not have aged in 15 years since the accident, her father, and the hero she ends up sleeping with. Come on, absolutely no reason why anyone with good movie tastes should rent this. I did and it was an absolute waste of time.",1174780800,,643,4.35
1559186,2,B00005JP8O,"This is NOT a horror movie. At best it's a thriller. In reality it's simply a vehicle for Sarah Michele Gellar. The movie is slow and convoluted. Except for a few moments of forced panic, Gellar walks through the movie with a clueless, zombie-like expression, reflecting the boredom I was experiencing. The ending has an interesting twist, but the build up, such as it was, was hardly worth the wait.  As much as I like Gellar, this is a movie I would have gladly passed on.",1174348800,3,474,4.511627906976744
1559187,4,B00005JP8O,"I didn't expect much from this relatively low-budget, unpublicized film. But I was very pleasantly surprised. This turned out to be quite an engrossing thriller.

Sarah Michelle Geller rushes through some of her lines, especially in her establishing scenes where she is shown making her sales pitch as a broker/salesperson of agricultural machinery. But she is better as the terrified victim of strange stalkings.

The photography is particularly good at adding to the tone of apprehension. The Texas landscape is shot across its eerie, earthen expanses. There is a reaching quality to many of these shots, reminiscent of some of Andrew Wyeth's sere landscapes. Abandoned autos dot the roadsides, and Geller often has to walk across shiny shards of gravel. There's an unusually glimmering, cutting quality to this hardscrabble. These are things you might really encounter throughout Texas, but in this case, they're subtle clues to the mystery of Geller's apparitions.

The movie's end ties all these fragments together and brings the action to a remarkably satisfying conclusion.",1174262400,,1080,5.416666666666667
1559246,4,B00005JP8O,"If you enjoy a good supernatural movie with moments where you will jump in your seat and where it is a while into the movie before you really know what is going on, you will love this movie!  Sarah Michelle Gellar stars in this shocking, non-stop supernatural thirller. It is a bit reminiscent of What Lies Beneath with Michelle Pfieffer.

Joanna Mills (Gellar) is haunted by increasintly terrifying visions where she can see and feel the brutal murder of a woman she's never met. With her life spiraling out-of-control, she follows the relentless nightmares to an eerie small town in Texas - a place where secrets can't be buried, a spirit seeks vengeance, and the horrific murder from Joanna's visions may just be her own.

A great performance by Gellar. You will be with her every step of the way, wondering what the heck is going on! But beware, if you like massacres, this movie isn't for you.  This movie is about dramatic tension, jump out of your seat, emotional and thoughtful scares.

I highly recommend you purchase this on DVD where you will get bonus features of an alternate ending that is ""Too Shocking for the Big Screen"" and some\ terrifying deleted scenes.",1174089600,2,1174,4.735294117647059

1559248,2,B00005JP8O,"Call me biased. Go ahead because I'm only going to write this review as a huge fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar. Okay, don't call me baised, actually, because I really didn't enjoy the movie.

 I don't know what it was about The Return that just never drew me in. It had Sarah Michelle Gellar. She was beautiful. Her turn as Joanne - the work obssessed, hallucinating, very confused young woman - was pretty mild comparer to other characters I've seen Sarah portray. I was actually bored while watching her. She seemed one dimensional. Pain was her only drive, and she just kept putting more on herself (character-wise and acting-wise).

 The story of Joanna - that being she keeps seeing visions of a murdered woman that somehow connects to Joanna's past - wasn't even that interesting. While it could have been played out to make the story interesting, nothing ever happened. We just got drawn out scenes in which Joanna would mope or explore (and never find anything), or we would get a small chase / scare scene that never really resulted in anything but trying to draw up suspense. It failed.

 One thing I did enjoy about The Return was the bleak color filters that were used throughout the film. A mixture of browns, oranges, and greys joined the tone of the film, or rather the tone that should have been with the film. And the whispering of ""Sunshine."" That was the only thing that twirked my horror nerve.

 Most people consider Simply Irresistible (aside from Harvard Man which we won't talk about) to be Sarah's biggest dissapointment. I disagree. I love Simply Irresistible. I fail to love The Return.",1173744000,3,1610,4.725

1559250,4,B00005JP8O,"Sarah Michelle Gellar is very good at the scary movies. And that is so in this movie also. Her acting is excellent for the role... a good match. Her career seems to be in the thriller/supernatural/horror genre now and that's okay because it suits her.

This movie is quite a good movie. Great plot with lots of intrigue and suspense. It plays out very well in the places it was filmed, which sometimes doesn't happen. The characters are real and easily identified with.

The story seems a bit disjointed and jumbled at first. We get to see fragments of moments that splinter along the way. As the plot thickens, those pieces come together in a good fit to complete the story.

But never is it too disjointed that you lose interest. The interest is built layer upon layer very nicely. There's no gratuitous gore or blood, just a really good, strong story with good acting.

What I didn't like was the sped-up shoots and the flushing of colors, or fade into black and white. That's way overdone lately and not necessary in this story. In fact, I think that this story line is so effective that it could have been all filmed in black and white.

All in all... definitely a must see, despite the film tricks.",1173398400,,1204,4.529953917050691

Gellar plays a sales rep who returns to her native Texas and discovers that there are some nasty skeletons in her closet that are haunting her.  She reunites with her father (Sam Shepard)and fslls for a local hunk and soon discovers what's terrifying her.

The disc offers an alternate ending that really isn't any more effective than the original, and a few deleted scenes.

1559253,5,B00005JP8O,"Sarah Michelle Gellar must have known that The Grudge 2 was going to be a total flop, so she probably begged to be killed off early so she could move on to better projects.  One of those projects must have been The Return.  No, this isn't a horror movie.  It's a psychological thriller that does an awesome job of challenging the mind.  It will keep you guessing till the end!

Think Six Sense meets What Lies Beneath.  Both were brilliant supernatural films that pulled you along, teasing you with just breadcrumbs of plot, making you beg to know how it was going to end...only to offer up a twist that denounced every guess you'd made so far.  The Return ranks way up there with the best of these mind-teasing films.

Backwoods La Salle Texas offers up a creepy backdrop to this easy paced thriller, although I kept thinking it should have been Arkansas with its rusted out cars in the yard and livestock auctions.  The creepy big houses in the middle of nowhere were a bit Texas Chainsaw-like and I half expected Leatherface himself to tear out of the barn at any minute.  An old dank bar next to a silo, the eerie lifeless hotel with raw meat hanging from hooks, the county carnival in the middle of a wheat field...all of these spooky places serve up interesting imagery to this story.

Darker hair and all, I believed Sarah standing there at the country crossroads in the middle of nowhere.  Her fear and terror were real, and not B-movie scream queen like.  And I never thought a Patsy Cline song could be so creepy!

The Return is simple, but well thought out.  The alternate ending at the end of the DVD would have changed most of the beginning of the movie.  I liked the one they stayed with better.  But there is one deleted scene that offers up a bit of explanation for a disgruntled fellow employee having followed Sarah to town.

All that aside, see The Return for what it is destined to be...a cult classic thriller that suits this genre so well.",1172793600,2,1961,4.491525423728813

The movie is very slow building up the plot - I think too slow.  The first 30 minutes drag along so slowly.  Only toward the end do things come together, and with few surprises.  Too many things in the film's script are just entirely too coincidental and too planned out to add to the suspension of disbelief.  Like horror films, it has the idiotic elements in it - going into dark houses uninvited, sudden visions meant to frighten, etc.  The movie isn't horrible, just slow and a bit boring.
