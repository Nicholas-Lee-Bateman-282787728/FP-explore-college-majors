3631634,4,B001HN697M,"First off, let me just say that I am a fan of the ""Underworld"" franchise and I do think that Kate Beckinsale is one of the most beautiful women on the planet. Plus, I am also a sucker for tales about vampires and werewolves. That said, this newest installment of the franchise ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" doesn't have the previous two films' director, (although Len Wiseman still has credits for the story) and the absence of Beckinsale is of course to be expected (she is also married to Len Wiseman) considering that this film is a prequel and has taken place before Selene's timeline. Seems like Hollywood have listened to the ""cries"" of die-hard fans of the franchise, and delivered a fun installment in a gothic period.

In an undisclosed time in the past, the coven of vampires ruled the land, using slaves in the form of Lycans to protect their empire. Lucian (Michael Sheen) may well be the first Lycan to be able to turn into human form at will, and for reasons of his own, vampire leader Viktor (Bill Nighy who reprises his role from the first film) decides to spare him and keep him as his ""favored"" slave. However, things get a little complicated when Lucian develops an undying love for Viktor's daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra) and dreams of freedom for his Lycan brethren. Now, the lines have been drawn, and the war between Vampires and Lycans is about to begin....

Patrick Totopoulos is now in the helm as director of ""Rise of the Lycans"" and while I'm not very familiar with his work, I have to say that Totopoulos does know how to make an effective monster feature. The werewolves looked very nasty and feral, even downright dirty, while the vampires have those blue contact lenses and wears fancy medieval armor. The screenplay does stay true to the mythos of the original, but it also nicely blends hyper-kinetic violence, with a Shakespearean ""Romeo and Juliet"", medieval backdrop in quite a modern fantasy film about the roots of the struggle between the mythological creatures. This prequel does take a life of its own, and while fans are in very familiar territory, the film doesn't exactly alienate new viewers.

The filmmakers does stay within the style and feel of the original film with the gloomy cinematography, bluish muted color schemes and the action sequences carry quite a bit in blood and gore elements--and those scenes are nicely placed. The action in ""Rise of the Lycans"" consists mostly of swordplay--beheadings are aplenty, limbs are torn and bodies are mutilated. Amid the CGI generated set designs, I was somewhat pleased that this prequel didn't exactly build upon the franchise's past mistakes but it develops a fresh angle on the ""Underworld"" mythos. There are familiar characters to be seen in the film, and there are subtle hints of things to come. The film also enforces a gothic element that wasn't fully realized in the first sequel, and the screenplay does give room for its performers to have touches of melodrama, complete with very cool, moody posturing.

I supposed the film's main strength will have to come from the effective performance of its cast. Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy does give a very heartfelt performance. Their chemistry as leaders of opposite sides are very nice to be privy to, as their interactions prove to be the film's central focus--a good move by the director since it proves to be a credible plot device to get the franchise's established formulas and romantic tragedies' groundwork. Rhona Mitra is a refreshing presence and proves convincing enough as Sonja, the one major catalyst for rebellion of the Lycans. Of course, fans of the franchise knew exactly what happened to her, and the film just fleshes out her relationship between Lucian, her father and the other vampires.

The film also touches on the vampires relationship with the humans living during this time, and as to how the humans managed to become the dominant species in our present time. The Vampires coven's ""Death Dealers"" were supposedly the guardians of the human populace, who protect them from the beastly werewolves. Apparently, werewolves are those infected with no ability to change back to human form, and in this manner the commentary on social status is reinforced. Werewolves are to be killed on sight while Lycans are used as slaves. There is also some commentary on the politics of this mythical world, vampires rule, Lycans serve and humans provide silver. Werewolves are the outcasts. The vampires would do anything to hold onto their power base.

""Underworld Rise of the Lycans"" may indeed be better than ""Evolution"" and the film does succeed as being a passionate period horror adventure. There is very small window of opportunity to further build on its mythos and it does do so quite well. The film's weakness may well be that being a prequel, it is difficult to offer that many surprises, if there are any at all. The film is a fun experience and highly entertaining to fans and even to those not familiar with the franchise. ""Underworld Rise of the Lycans"" is a bloody, stylish, visceral, melodramatic installment to further develop the war between vampires and werewolves. It awakens the senses that this franchise is very much alive, and left me wanting more.

Recommended! [4- Stars]",1232841600,103,5262,4.8923766816143495
3631635,5,B001HN697M,"I so loved another powerful woman having a key role in an Underworld movie!
It was also ultimately exciting to see how Lucien became what you saw of him in the first movie. My favourite character is Lucien and it is nice to see the Lycan side of the story--with being a lifetime vampire person, the Lycans really turned my head with these movies.
Will see it again in the theater and definitely purchase when it comes out on DVD!",1232841600,,429,4.375
3631636,4,B001HN697M,"""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" was a pretty good movie. Despite lacking in plot, it had excellent direction and amazing scenes. It was an action packed movie from beginning to end and this is what made the movie so good.

This is a prequel to the Underworld movies and tells the story of the enslavement and revolution of the Lycans, led Lucian, and his love affair with Sonja, Viktor's daughter. The movie did not really add much to the Underworld story, only visualize the story of Lucian.

As I mentioned, the scenes were amazingly shot; the dark hue of the movie is what makes it so alluring and raw. The camera work is excellent and the direction was precise. The performances were pretty good as well. The movie was very entertaining and left me wanting for another.",1232755200,,774,4.642335766423358
3631637,3,B001HN697M,"If you enjoyed the other two films in the Underworld series you will probably find more to like than hate with this prequel. Bill Nighy and Michael Sheen are back and elevate even the most lackluster dialogue, while Rhona Mitra makes a good replacement for Kate Beckinsale. The CGI and pratical effects are blended nicely, but this movie is just so dark and edited with so many quick cuts it's hard to see what's going on during most of the fight scenes. We also know who is going to live and die, so there is little suspense or wonder at all when swords clash between main characters who we know are around in the other movies.

While Underworld: Rise of the Lycans doesn't break any new ground, it was nice to see the back story played out. If you are a huge fan of the series, it might be worth a trip to the theater, otherwise I recommend you wait for the DVD.",1232755200,3,864,4.300613496932515
3631638,3,B001HN697M,"Rise of the Lycans is the prehistory of the Underworld series, where the genesis of the vampire/werewolf feud is revealed. This fraught mythology is classic fare with no surprises. Still the gloomy tale provides cheap thrills and lots of action from special-effects-expert-turned-director Tatopolous. The ornate blue and black gleam of the murky Underworld universe is beautifully portrayed.

Die-hard Underworld fans beware--the only prominent character from the first two movies of the trilogy is Victor, the patriarch of the vampire clan, played with intensity and stamina by Bill Nighy.

Critics are complimenting the performance of Michael Sheen who plays Lucian, the rebel leader of the werewolves and secret lover of Sonja, the unruly vampire princess,played by Rhona Mitra. Sheen's rasputin-esque good looks contrast nicely with Mitra's austere alabaster beauty. These unkempt lovers are the vortex around which this thriller revolves and their chemistry carries the story. Fans of Beckinsale may miss her leather-encased pulchritude but I found Mitra's fiery energy a welcome change that provided a more textured and muscular characterization of a female vampire psyche.

In a movie season devoid of good fantasy movies and in particular vampire/werewolf tales, Rise of the Lycans provides a welcome diversion!",1232755200,7,1319,5.685279187817259

3631672,2,B001HN697M,"Alas, Michael Sheen may be a very capable character actor, but he can work-out until he's blue in the face (which he obviously did) and he'll never look like or project the charisma of a heroic, romantic leading man. [He looks like an accountant with a really kick-ass personal trainer.]

The lack of a real leading man and a veritable orgy of repetitive CGI werewolf transformations make this the least interesting of all the UNDERWORLD films so far. If it merits any creative awards it would be for the single stupidest love-making scene I've ever witnessed. I would say, ""It has to be seen to be believed!"" but then I would have to quickly add, ""On second thought, don't bother!""",1508457600,,682,4.683333333333334
3631673,5,B001HN697M,"I was leery about buying this movie. Friends warned me that it wouldnt be worth watching because Selen isn't in it, so I started to skip this one and move to Awakening. Im so glad I didnt. Quite frankly, Rise of the Lycans is my favorite in the series. Michael Sheen puts on a stellar performance as Lucian, a Lycan who falls in love with a vampire.

3631674,3,B001HN697M,"This might almost have made it on its own, it's good enough for that.
It also works as a prequel, setting things up for the first Underworld film -- and would do so even without the inevitable but nonetheless idiotic tie-in bit at the end. As if we couldn't figure it out on our own.
The female lead was also slightly better than in the others; but then, it is a different character.",1507248000,,383,4.260273972602739
3631675,4,B001HN697M,"Another history lesson, this time it concerns Lucian (Michael Sheen) the first werewolf capable of retaining human form, the first Lycan.  He is coveted by Viktor (Bill Nighy) as the first of many Lycan slaves that he hopes to press into service as their daytime guardians.  At night he expects them to labor, no rest for the wicked.  Sadly, things do not go according to Viktors plans, as noted in the very first Underworld film.  This installment is therefore plagued by a foregone conclusion already known.  And unfortunately, Sonja (Rhona Mitra) is not a compelling character.  Instead, this film is Michael Sheens from beginning to end, with an able assist by Bill Nighy as the conveying vampire elder with Lycan issues he cant overcome.  Viktor makes a dandy grim reaper.
This movie is definitely black and blue and dead all over.

As an action/battle/exploit in the darkest of night, its not half bad.",1507161600,2,908,4.888888888888889

It sets up who the main characters are, especially Viktor (Bill Nighy) and how cold hearted his character really is (no pun intended after all he is a vampire and I suppose he would have a cold heart?). Michael Sheen gives a great performance as Lucian and Rhona Mitra is beautiful as Sonja; Kate Beckinsale who plays Selene in the Underworld move could be her twin. Truth be told the fist time I saw both movies, about seven years ago, I thought they were the same actresses. I think they look a lot alike, but that's me. Both woman are beautiful and both give excellent performances. Rhona Mitra in Underworld: Rise of the Lycans and Kate Beckinsale in Underworld.",1481241600,2,779,4.735294117647059
3631939,4,B001HN697M,"This prequel tells much about the major character from the original.  What was just a few flashbacks in the first movie, becomes a full story in this movie.

It begins with the birth of Lucian.  Before him there'd only been full Werewolves, William's breed; savage beasts never able to take human form again.  From Lucian's bite, Victor spawned the Lycans - shape shifters , werewolf but also human.  Victor used them as a peasant class of immortals - slave labor and guard dogs.

The story is about Victors daughter, Sonja,  and Lucian falling in love, ultimate forbidden love.  Lucian escaping and starting revolution against the Vampires.  Recruiting human peasants, and turning those who chose into Lycans.  Lucian being captured, and forced to watch Sonja's execution.  Then the wolves massacre most of Victors people, and take over his castle. With that the Lycans would never again be Slaves to Vampires; they'd risen to the level of the Vampires Mortal Enemies.

The parts I admire most are the execution, Lucian's near escape, the attack, and the final battle.

Execution:  Lucian was chained and silver kept him from changing.  He was forced to watch, as the skylight was opened.  He couldn't reach Sonja.  He couldn't use his own body to shield her from the light, or hold her and burn with her.  He valued her beyond everything, including his own life, and he couldn't save her, couldn't die for her,  couldn't even die with her.

Near Escape:  Victor came to the execution room.  The sight of Victor instantly transformed Lucian's grief into pure hate.  Then Victor ordered his men to fetch his knives, he planned to torture Lucian.  Victor actually believed he could hurt Lucian more than he'd already done!

That delay bought Lucian the time he needed.  Lucian soaked up the Power of the Full Moon, and used it to expel the Silver. His wolf form attacked Victor, took Sonja's Pendant, and made for the Castle Walls.  Only to be hit with arrows attached to chains at the top tower.  He let out a primal howl and roar as his escape was foiled.

The Attack:  Every wolf who'd heard Lucian's call answered it.  Hoards of his Breed and William's rushed to castle.  Ran right up the wall and tore the Death Dealers apart, then massacred the Vampire Council.  Victor had created the Lycans to use against William's kind, and Lucian united both breeds against a common enemy.

Final Battle:  Lucian and Victor faced off. Each blaming the other for what had happened to Sonja, each trying to vent their grief.  Lucian didn't resume his wolf form.  He fought Victor Sword to Sword - Man to Man.",1479254400,,2599,4.7725225225225225

This being a fitting prequel to the first two, it fills the story line in fine where it gives you a complete background to what happened before Seline comes on the scene. Special mention to Bill Nighy, a fave actor of mine. He always puts 110% into every role he plays, and as Victor there is no exception. Highly recommended.",1462147200,,367,4.492537313432836

3632287,5,B001HN697M,"I've read reviews for this film on several websites, and I can't give any nod toward the critics that bash this film. I've seen all of the Underworld film series, but hadn't caught this one due to life events around the time of its release. I watched Underworld, and Underworld: Evolution, just prior to viewing this, and it has the precise DNA as the others. I'm am a huge fan of the other 3 installments, so seeing this was a genuine treat. We'd seen and heard much of this story in the previous two installments, but actually watching the sequence of events unfold in the same silver screen experience as the others was fantastic.

I believe the casting was superb, bringing back as many original cast members as possible, and the scene matching to the flashback of the other films was also done very, very well.

I must admit that Underworld Rise Of The Lycans is not a bad movie, for anyone who has seen the original Underworld, then i'll just say that its a more in-depth telling of the flashbacks from that movie so don't be expecting a difficult plot to follow, in fact if you've seen underworld you pretty much know the whole storyline.",1438128000,,557,4.626262626262626

Lucian leads a revolt which starts the centuries old war that goes on until Underworld Evolution and Awakening.

3632601,4,B001HN697M,"They say this movie ruined the Underworld series by taking the focus off of Selene and focusing entirely on Viktor and his relationship to his daughter and Lucien. I disagree, I like how this movie is a prequel that explains the beginning of the conflict between Viktor and Lucien that we see in the original Underworld. I'm also a huge Bill Nighy fan so personal bias there. There is a bit of an issue with Sonja since she was blonde in the Underworld flashback but has black hair here (black hair makes more sense since it was said that Selene reminded Viktor so much of her). It is a movie that does not require you to have seen Underworld to watch (except for the narration in the beginning and end).

Overall, it's a great addition to the Underworld Saga.

3632718,4,B001HN697M,"Underworld series prequel earning 4 of 5 mainly because it is a roller coaster ride that was fun for me. As the third in the series I expected forward with Selen and Michael, but the Underworld producers went back to the beginning.  Here you have the story of Lycans and Vampires that led to the original Underworld movie.

This one embraces the Romeo and Juliet plot and converts it to fit in the world of vampires and werewolves.  Much more info and too much is revealed, I think.  You still have all the action and excitement well known for the Underworld series.  No Kate Beckinsale as Selene to drool at, as Rise of the Lycans is actually a prequel to Underworld. Enter the beautiful Rhona Mitra as Sonja. Folks may know Rhona Mitra was Claire Radcliff in the wonderful TV series, The Gates: A vampire and werewolf TV series that was sadly canceled after the first season.  Rhona is not a step down from Kate, so those who come to drool, you've not been forgotten.

Lucian, a new kind of Lycan, plays Romeo to Sonja, a princess Vampire as Juliet. All the emotions you might put in any adaptation of Shakespeare's play you can invest in this outing.  Except, in my opinion, you should wear a seat belt as well.

If you haven't watched these Underworld movies the watch order should be Rise of the Lycans, Underworld, Underworld: Evolution, Underworld: Awakenings. #3, #1, #2, #4. These movies had good writers and among the action, excitement, and gore are good stories that should entertain more than just an adrenaline fix.

J. Michael Stracynski was my motivation to watching the series.  JMS screenplays are always good.  When I heard he wrote ""Awakenings"" I jumped in and watched the earlier movies first.",1382918400,,1714,4.695652173913044
3632719,5,B001HN697M,"loved the entire series. I wouldn't purchase a digital only copy again, but a blu-ray or DVD combo. Good if you don't have a player and only watch online",1382745600,,153,4.310344827586207

3632747,1,B001HN697M,"unless you are a diehard ""underworld"" fanboy, and you are under 18 years of age and don't have a driver's license to prove it ... don't do it. just back away from the preview and click away to something better.

the acting here is straight out of the 19th century. it's the first film in which bill nighy actually flares his nostrils. and that's the *subtle* aspect of his acting. rhona mitra looks like kate beckinsale but punched in the mouth (or with rilly bad botox). the action sequences are toss offs and the plot was written with crayons. the sets are low budget dungeon and the supporting cast inconsequential. the computer graphics are actually not that convincing or creative. it's a breadcrumb movie, something shaken out of a cardboard can onto a slab of fishy meat.

ask yourself: why isn't kate beckinsale in this thing? she launched the franchise, she's gorgeous, she's smart, why doesn't she ride this juggernaut to its triumphant prequel? maybe she smelled something fishy.",1376784000,,990,4.85207100591716
3632748,4,B001HN697M,"Although I enjoyed the film, I have one comment to make that is negative. Like so many of the movies of its kind, the dark scenes are sometimes a hindrance to the action going on. There should be a way to convey the darkness without destroying the action.

3632859,4,B001HN697M,"This is one movie I held off buying at first, as I thought the female role of Selene was being played by another actress.  After watching it I found this was not the case at all...but rather the movie is pre Selene chronicling the rise of the Lycans; and the forbidden love between their leader Lucian (Michael Sheen) and Victor's daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra).  The special visual effects used in this movie are outstanding to say the least...making you feel like you're right there running with the Lycans through the forest or part of a Vampire-Lycan battle.  Great acting by all, though I believe Michael Sheen and Rhona Mitra pretty much stole the show!

We saw already the fate of Victor's daughter and her story with Lucian in flashbacks, so why make a film about it. After these opening words you ask yourself, dear reader, why three stars. I can tell you why: I'm a big creature movie fan and this film has plenty of those and I do have a soft spot for vereything that is set in medieval times and I'm a big fan of Patrick Tatopoulos work.

3633078,3,B001HN697M,"Humans live under the protection of vampire warlords who have managed to keep the surrounding territory's murderous werewolves at bay through sheer brutality. Once bitten, mortals transform into mindless beasts without the ability to return to their former form... until Lucian is born, a powerful hybrid who can control his shape-shifting at will. Using his genetics, Viktor (Bill Nighy) creates a new breed of werewolf known as Lycans, who serve the vampires as daylight guardians. Enslaved and heavily guarded, the Lycans dream of freedom and a privileged few are trusted intimately by their masters. Among them is Lucian (Michael Sheen), whose loyalty is proven and whose love belongs to Viktor's beautiful daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra). Spirited and rebellious against her father's authority, Sonja constantly bends the rules and places herself in peril.

In order to prevent her from being killed, Lucian commits the cardinal rule of his race -- he removes his slave collar, transforms into a beast, and defends her. Viktor is infuriated with this obvious contempt for the rules and condemns him to be punished and his privileges revoked. This prompts Lucian to make a bid for freedom, little realizing what -- and who -- is at stake. Audiences familiar with the original films and characters will know various plot twists before they transpire on-screen, but it's also a reasonable introduction to the franchise for new fans, as it establishes all the main threads and individuals who become important later on. I love that we were allowed to see into an earlier era before the Lycans obtained freedom from the vampires. Lucian has never been a favorite but watching his story unfold gave me greater compassion for him. It was also a pleasure to see Viktor in his element, since he makes only brief but impacting appearances in earlier productions. My only disappointment was that while Marcus' storyline was fleshed out in the second film, the other Elder has not been fully explored. Amelia does not even make an appearance, which is a shame.

The purpose of the franchise is to create a surreal existence in which two immortal forces are locked in eternal warfare. This film is the origins of that notorious rivalry and while there are moments of inconsistency with the sequels, it is arguably the best of the franchise. Its setting in the middle ages is more compelling and epic than the modern day interpretation where vampires run around with silver bullets. The costume design is somewhat overlooked but if you care to watch for details you will see some exquisite examples of period work in the luxurious coats and rich fabrics. One friend commented that in some respects, it is the werewolf version of Bravheart and there is a mild resemblance in Lucian's stirring speeches and underdog battle against the establishment ... but the vampires are not one-sided either. Everyone has motivations and reasons for their actions and so it's very difficult to completely choose a side. The look of the film in particular is magnificent -- very gothic and ghostly, from pale vampires to darkened forest lanes. There are no automatic weapons here, just broadswords and a few mean fighting sequences.

This film has the strongest script of the three and the most memorable performances. The true gem is Bill Nighy, whose steely, blue-eyed performance never wavers in the role of a ruthless warlord who would sacrifice anything to maintain power. He might make light of his ""hissing"" scenes in recent interviews, but it fantastic on-screen. Whatever you think of the franchise in general, you have to admit that overall it's just plain cool.",1332892800,,3644,5.059900166389351

Lucian the Lycan leads a Lycan uprising against the Vampires because they no longer want to be in servitude to the Vampires.

No plot spoilers from me; this follows the story line show in ""Underworld"" where the werewolf slave Lucian (Michael Sheen) has a forbidden relationship with the vampire coven leader's (Viktor, again played by Bill Nighy) daughter, Sonja (Rhona Mitra). There are a few interesting subplots, including how Lucian becomes the leader of the lycans and the origin of one of the more memorable werewolves from the first movie.

The cinematography is excellent, making the mood of the movie very ""Gothic"" and is very much reminiscent of ""Underworld"". The action is much more intense and the special effects are even better this time.

Once again, some liberties were taken with the vampire and werewolf mythologies but nothing too far out of bounds. Like the first movie, my only real complaint is that the average vampire is portrayed as far too weak compared to the werewolves.

Fans of the original movie, like me, will likely enjoy this one as well.

3633205,1,B001HN697M,"Vampires vs. werewolves seems to be the popular supernatural conflict in movies right now, but I'll give credit where credit is due -- ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" actually provides some backstory for that war. This prequel to the other two ""Underworld"" movies is a grimy, gloomy affair that has some good acting, but is drained dry by choppy direction, a flimsy plot and a love story that never quite convinces.

Lucian (Michael Sheen) was the first of the Lycans -- rational lycanthropes capable of taking human form. Born from a savage werewolf, he was made into the personal slave/protege of the vampire lord Viktor (Bill Nighy). But things began to go wrong when two things happened: Viktor began breeding a new race of Lycans by infecting humans with Lucian's curse, and Lucian fell in love with Viktor's lovely daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra). The Lycans are treated like beasts of burden by the vampires, and rebellion is starting to stir among them -- and especially in Lucian, who sees them as his people now.

But when Lucian is savagely punished for removing his slave collar (so he could save Sonja from werewolves), he decides enough is enough -- he and a small band of Lycans break out of the fortress and escape into neighboring lands. But he's determined to return for Sonja, whose affair with Lucian has been discovered by a horrified, grief-stricken Viktor -- and as the armed, organized Lycans clash with their former masters, someone will lose everything.

""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" is sort of a werewolf ""Ten Commandments"" crossed with a bit of goth ""Romeo and Juliet"" -- basically it's about a rather straightforward slave uprising, and a forbidden love that obviously isn't gonna end well. The entire movie is bathed in gloomy shadows, rain and lots of pale anemic light; everybody wears weird pseudomedieval armor and lives in grimy stone fortresses that would drive most people to suicide.

The plot also isn't terribly complex -- there are no twists or unexpected moments in either the slave uprising or the forbidden love affair. Both subplots go from A to Z with brain-melting predictability. What's more, the romantic angle is painfully unconvincing-- Lucian and Sonja start boinking out of the blue about five minutes after meeting each other, and they do it in a sewer. Apparently this is supposed to convey eternal true love... but it just left me thinking how gross it was.

It also helps to ignore the choppy direction, frequently pompous dialogue (""Do you not realize that what I am giving you is a gift?"" ""It's a curse!"") and dense melodrama (""We can be slaves, or we can be LYYYYCAAAAAAANS!""). Fortunately it isn't half bad at action scenes -- we've got big brutal werewolves, anemic noble vampires, lots of leather and metal armor, and plenty of necks being torn out with big bloody teeth.

Sheen and Mitra both do good jobs as Sonja and Lucian, although Sheen yells a lot and Mitra looks terminally ill (would it have killed them to give the poor woman some lipstick?). While they do solid jobs throughout the movie, they are genuinely moving during their last scene together. Bill Nighy manages to bring some extra dimensions to a flat villain, by conveying his grief over his daughter's betrayal of her vampire kind, and Kevin Grevioux brings a lot of life to the smallish role of Lucius' second-in-command.

""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" is a simplistic movie riddled with gothic gloom, goofy melodrama and a very flat love story. Sheen, Mitra and Nighy are its main saving graces... but they're nowhere near enough.",1261785600,2,3570,4.900662251655629

This movie takes place in the middle ages of Europe, where we see the vampires create a race of werewolves to serve them as slaves inside their castle.  By the end of the movie, the werewolves have freed themselves, starting the blood feud between the two that is captured in the first 2 Underworld movies.

The movie is a mix of horror, action, romance and some drama.  The acting is fairly good, with multiple characters getting in some lines of dialogue.  The action is also good, with lots of blood but minimal gore.  The special effects are spot on.  My only caution is to watch this movie in a darkened room; as most of the scenes take place at night, a bright room will flood the viewer's eyes and diminish much of the detail of the movie's images.",1259798400,,1423,4.537254901960784

3633211,1,B001HN697M,"Vampires vs. werewolves seems to be the popular supernatural conflict in movies right now, but I'll give credit where credit is due -- ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" actually provides some backstory for that war. This prequel to the other two ""Underworld"" movies is a grimy, gloomy affair that has some good acting, but is drained dry by choppy direction, a flimsy plot and a love story that never quite convinces.

Lucian (Michael Sheen) was the first of the Lycans -- rational lycanthropes capable of taking human form. Born from a savage werewolf, he was made into the personal slave/protege of the vampire lord Viktor (Bill Nighy). But things began to go wrong when two things happened: Viktor began breeding a new race of Lycans by infecting humans with Lucian's curse, and Lucian fell in love with Viktor's lovely daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra). The Lycans are treated like beasts of burden by the vampires, and rebellion is starting to stir among them -- and especially in Lucian, who sees them as his people now.

But when Lucian is savagely punished for removing his slave collar (so he could save Sonja from werewolves), he decides enough is enough -- he and a small band of Lycans break out of the fortress and escape into neighboring lands. But he's determined to return for Sonja, whose affair with Lucian has been discovered by a horrified, grief-stricken Viktor -- and as the armed, organized Lycans clash with their former masters, someone will lose everything.

""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" is sort of a werewolf ""Ten Commandments"" crossed with a bit of goth ""Romeo and Juliet"" -- basically it's about a rather straightforward slave uprising, and a forbidden love that obviously isn't gonna end well. The entire movie is bathed in gloomy shadows, rain and lots of pale anemic light; everybody wears weird pseudomedieval armor and lives in grimy stone fortresses that would drive most people to suicide.

The plot also isn't terribly complex -- there are no twists or unexpected moments in either the slave uprising or the forbidden love affair. Both subplots go from A to Z with brain-melting predictability. What's more, the romantic angle is painfully unconvincing-- Lucian and Sonja start boinking out of the blue about five minutes after meeting each other, and they do it in a sewer. Apparently this is supposed to convey eternal true love... but it just left me thinking how gross it was.

It also helps to ignore the choppy direction, frequently pompous dialogue (""Do you not realize that what I am giving you is a gift?"" ""It's a curse!"") and dense melodrama (""We can be slaves, or we can be LYYYYCAAAAAAANS!""). Fortunately it isn't half bad at action scenes -- we've got big brutal werewolves, anemic noble vampires, lots of leather and metal armor, and plenty of necks being torn out with big bloody teeth.

Sheen and Mitra both do good jobs as Sonja and Lucian, although Sheen yells a lot and Mitra looks terminally ill (would it have killed them to give the poor woman some lipstick?). While they do solid jobs throughout the movie, they are genuinely moving during their last scene together. Bill Nighy manages to bring some extra dimensions to a flat villain, by conveying his grief over his daughter's betrayal of her vampire kind, and Kevin Grevioux brings a lot of life to the smallish role of Lucius' second-in-command.

""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" is a simplistic movie riddled with gothic gloom, goofy melodrama and a very flat love story. Sheen, Mitra and Nighy are its main saving graces... but they're nowhere near enough.",1259539200,3,3570,4.900662251655629

Michael Sheen returns as Lucian (the head lycan from the first movie), and the amazing thing here is they actually made him look younger in this, the prequel. Aside from those things, however, the movie offers absolutely nothing new to the story that's already been laid down in the first two movies, a fact that culminates in one of the worst endings to a movie I've ever seen, structurally speaking. The rule of thumb for storytelling is, the ending should be inevitable but unexpected. Guess what? You saw the ending coming, from about 2 movies ago.

Underworld: Rise of the Lycans however just barely ends up being the best of the film series, in least in my eyes, considering I've never been too bowled over by the franchise to begin with.  The film details the beginnings of the war between the vampires and the Lycans, with brutal vampire lord Viktor (Bill Nighy) using the Lycans as slaves, including the special Lucian (Michael Sheen).  Viktor doesn't know of the ill-fated love affair between his daughter (Rhona Mitra) and Lucian however, and it doesn't take too much to see where everything leads.  Predictability aside, Underworld: Rise of the Lycans works well thanks to some rousing battle scenes, and mostly thanks to the performances of Sheen and Nighy, whose appearances in the Underworld films always managed to elevate them to being better than they should be.

Making the transition from ""The Damned United"" to the damned in general, Sheen really is quite good in this movie. Perhaps as Brian Clough, instead of moving from Leeds to Nottingham Forest, someone suggested that he might like a spell in charge of Wolves. (English football pun, don't say anything).

Anyway, penology apart, this film really is quite a good prequel. Kate Beckinsales bum was Oscar nominated in Underworld, and possibly only Carry-Anne Moss's bum in The Matrix could match it, bums aside.. Rhona Mitre was excellent casting in the film, as she indeed looks like Ms Beckinsale and has the all action pedigree to bring something to the role, Bill Nighy is of course, all nasty as Viktor, and the whole thing comes together nicely through a series of set pieces to end rather wonderfully at the start of the first Underworld, which is exactly what I want of a prequel. In fact as prequels go, it is one of the best I have seen with regard to building in the existing elements into the story.

You can compare and contrast with the Terminator series where the story and continuity has been managed so completely, it makes the Star Wars septulogy (Is that a word?) look like historical documents in comparison.

So, in summary, Rise of the Lycans is well cast, well realised, pretty well acted and like the best Ikea furniture, all the bits are stuck in the right places, the right way and with no box of screw left over at the end.

In any case, I was utterly disappointed with this DVD edition.  No inside booklet, no pictures, no DVDs with extras.  The only extras you get to see are the Director's and Producers' comments, 2 ""how it was made"" documentaries and 1 music video.

I always watch the movies with the comments, as directors usually have loads to tell about the scenes, how they manage to do this and that, and such.  After 15 minutes I stopped watching, as the track was quite a boring exchange between the director and the producers of how awesome this and that actor was, and how fortunate they were to have them.

The 2 documentaries were actually interesting, but very, very short.

The music video was just that, a music video with built-in movie scenes.

I ignore if they went far in creating the Blu-Ray edition, but certainly the DVD turned out short on everything we fans crave:  no interviews, not behind the scenes, not out-takes... Not even the B-rolls that are available on You Tube.  If you want extras, go there to watch them.

I just hope they'll release a special edition with time.  If not, it's obvious they are pushing so everybody switches to Blu-Ray format.",1245283200,,1277,4.622222222222222
3633341,5,B001HN697M,"Third of the Underworld series, Rise Of The Lycans takes place in the medieval Dark Ages, hundreds of years before the first Underworld and the bulk of Underworld: Evolution, and perhaps a (human) generation or two after the flashback portion of Underworld: Evolution where we witnessed the dawn of the vampire and werewolf (or Lycan, in Underworld terminology) races.  The vampires reign supreme over a fair-sized swath of territory in Europe, existing as feudal overlords to the frightened humans (who only suspect what the land's masters really are) and have enslaved almost all the remaining Lycans.  The Lycans at this time are bestial and aggressive, never taking human form and assumed to be incapable of actual thought (although this is called into question later in the movie).  History reaches a pivot point with the birth of a new kind of Lycan - born human, and later capable of transformation back and forth.  This is Lucian (Michael Sheen), familiar to viewers of the series, and although the reigning vampire lord Viktor (Bill Nighy, also a familiar face from the previous chapters)'s first instinct is to kill the newborn infant, he hesitates - whether out of compassion or out of seeing the potential in a new breed of slave, one's never quite sure - and lets the child live.

  Lucian grows to an adult and, as viewers of the original know, falls in love with the vampire Sonja, daughter of Viktor, which viewers also know is going to be the catalyst for war between the races.  We know in advance that their love is going to end tragically, but, as with a movie like Titanic, knowing things are going to end badly only amps up the emotions and the tragedy.  Without going into too much detail, Lucian, who's favored among Lycans but still a slave, is already moving down the path of being a potential liberator/semi-messianic figure for his terribly-treated brethren; the horrors of what happens when Viktor uncovers the relationship between his daughter and what he considers a 'beast' seal the path of fate and flames Lucian into leading a full-out insurrection, not only of the slave Lycans within the fortress walls of the vampires' domain, but of the 'wild' Lycans outside.

  I initially didn't know how well a third Underworld was going to turn out without Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and Michael (Scott Speedman) in it; as it turns out it worked great.  The roles of Lucian and Viktor in the Underworld mythos became even larger, and both actors (who did great jobs in the original) give tour-de-force, multi-facted performances.  Sonja (Rhona Mitra)'s resemblance to Selene in both appearance and temperament isn't coincidence: it was established in the first movie that Selene's resemblance to Viktor's deceased daughter was why he made her a vampire in the first place and why he favored her over the centuries.  The three leads - Lucian, Viktor and Sonja - anchor the movie so well (and the performers play their parts so well) that the abscence of Selene and Michael doesn't hurt the movie (although I still wouldn't mind if they returned for Underworld 4).  The character of Raze (Kevin Grevioux) from the first movie is also present, and his role is greatly expanded on.

  Underworld: Rise Of The Lycans is a highly stylized (the most so of the trilogy), grand-scale, effectively gory, horror epic with terrific visuals, action, and a beautifully captured world of iron and stone, forests and labyrinths, ferocious werewolves and icy vampires.

  I hope they follow this up with a fourth chapter - whether it takes place somewhere between this one's ending and the start of the first movie, or whether it takes place after Underworld: Evolution (and actually, they could even go back to before the flashback from Evolution, either in an entire movie or in little slivers as just part of a movie); this is a mythos that could continue to expand for a while longer, and could even bring in other creatures/elements from folklore and legend to play a role.",1245110400,2,3985,4.907600596125186
3633342,4,B001HN697M,"Sometime before the original film, vampires ruled. Their labor came from lycan slaves. Lucian (Sheen) was the only lycan who was able to transform to human shape. Lucian is the favored slave of Viktor (Nighy) the vampire leader.  He's also the undercover lover of Sonia (Nitra) Viktor's daughter.

Lucian leads the Lycans against Viktor and the vamps when his love's destroyed.  The fight, in true ""Underworld"" fashion takes place mostly with archaic weapons and a lot of blood and gore.

It's difficult for me to review a prequel film, because I know what is going to happen.  Still, ""Rise of the Lycans"" has well earned the right to stand on its own. The film's continuity is excellent with a strong look and feel like the original ""Underworld"" episode: very eerie bluish lighting and dark, even sounds the same.

Too many CGI lycans not enough practical effects. It was a distraction.

Perfect casting though...I mean really! Except for the obvious, Craven (Shane Brolly)  missing, he would have added some edge to the story.  Besides he was so much ""brooding"" fun in the first movie.

3633467,4,B001HN697M,"Ok, I'll admit it.... I'm a vampire lover from waaaay back.  I always hated it when Dracula got it in the end.... oh the angst of watching him die time and time again.  However, I also suffer from the ""Rocky Syndrome"".... I always pull for the underdog!

Was this movie necessary to make?  No, not really.  Been told and retold.  However, I'm pleased they did.  It's a rehashing of the old story of two kids from opposite sides of the tracks, she of the ruling class (vampire) and he of the down trodden, (lycan), who indulge in forbidden love, a definate no no. It's also a bit of ""Braveheart"".... ""FREEEEEEDOOOOOM"".  Woven into this illicit affair is the long overdue upraising and rebellion of the oppressed Lycans from their masters the Death Dealers.

I couldn't help but root for Lucien, aptly played by Michael Sheen, and his brothers in their bid for freedom.  Sheen portrays emotion very well and actually looks kinda hot as the long haired and scraggly Lucien.  Who'd have thunk it, as he usually looks dweebie in everything else I've ever seen him in.

Bill Nighy is superb as the steely eyed, hard hearted Viktor, who won't allow even his own daughter to interrupt his iron fisted will in governing of the coven.  He doesn't even seem to be phased in the least when he sentences her to death for her indiscretions with a mongrel.  Way to rule Dad!!!

If you are an Underworld fan, check this one out. I think you'll enjoy it.  The reason for only (""4"") stars is that the movie is a bit dark in some places, not theme wise, but visually.  Also some of the fight scenes were a little bit too frenetic.  It was a little hard to keep track of who was who.

Lucian (Michael Sheen), is leader of the werewolves.

The only good thing about this move is the love between Michael Sheen and Rhona Mitra. It provides a couple of touching scenes. But they are too few to make the film worth while.

3633470,2,B001HN697M,"Maybe because it was filmed in New Zealand, maybe because the good guys have pointy ears, and definitely because 92 minutes felt like 3 hours, I think a more apt title would have been ""Underworld: Lord of the Borings.""

The whole movie is blue and dark and everyone speaks in those flat, expressionless English accents that seem to be a requirement for acting in films set in the old-timey days, no matter where or when. I think this story is supposed to take place in medieval Hungary. So would it have been so bad for Sonja - the female protagonist - to talk like Zsa Zsa Gabor? ""I vant to suck your bloooood, dahling!""

Anyway, ""Rise of the Lycans"" is just kind of dull. The fights aren't particularly exciting (a lot of half-a**ed sword swingin'), the special effects (i.e. rubber suits and cheap CGI) are pretty lame, and it doesn't follow the ""rules"" established in the first two movies. Vampires and werewolves killed by swords and arrows? Whatever, man. Still, it's slightly better than ""Underworld 2,"" but only because it has a clear beginning, a middle, and an end.

3633506,5,B001HN697M,"RISE OF THE LYCANS, like its predecessors, is another slickly made movie (which looks and sounds great in the disc's 2.40:1 widescreen and Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation) that is, once again, heavy on the digital FX, but its simple ROMEO AND JULIET/SPARTACUS story works in its favor. Like EVOLUTION, it explores the Lycan-vampire history, but unlike the second movie, RISE isn't impeded by unnecessary overcomplications and entanglements. With Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and Michael's (Scott Speedman) story concluded in EVOLUTION, RISE OF THE LYCANS goes back in time to tell another tale of interspecies amour that causes conflict between the warring tribes. This time, the forbidden love is between Lucian (Sheen) and Sonja (DOOMSDAY's Rhona Mitra, looking very Beckinsale-ish). You may recall from the prior films that Lucian is the Lycan leader who fought against the vampires and their chieftain, Viktor (Bill Nighy), who is also Sonja's father. RISE takes place during the ""Dark Ages,"" in which Viktor and the coven reside in a castle where enslaved werewolves protect them during the day; the bloodsuckers also have a deal with their human neighbors in which they defend them from the wild creatures in the woods. Lucian is Viktor's favored slave, and the first Lycan (humans who can change into beasts and vice versa). But when Viktor learns of Lucian's love for Sonja, he imprisons Lucian and uses him to create a new line of Lycan slaves. This heightens Lucian's animosity toward his vampire rulers and ignites him to lead a SPARTACUS-esque Lycan revolt. Patrick Tatopoulos (the creature designer and supervisor on the other UNDERWORLDs) took over the directing reigns here from Len Wiseman, who served as one of RISE's producers. The pair are joined by producers Richard Wright and Gary Lucchesi and executive producer James McQuaide on the disc's audio commentary--which, given Tatopoulos' background, unsurprisingly places the emphasis on the various practical and visual FX and how they were used throughout the film. The discussion is of the adequate sort that I've come to expect from most DVD talk tracks. One thing you learn is that the movie was initially going to start off with the plague's origin and Corvinus' story, but that had to be cut for budgetary reasons. The group also spends a good deal of time talking about how RISE connects with the other films and the importance of making sure this prequel properly and legitimately tied in with them. Why Wiseman vacated the director's chair and how Tatopoulos was chosen as his replacement is one of the behind-the-scenes topics covered in UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS: From Script to Screen. This featurette runs only nine minutes, but also covers shooting the movie in New Zealand, the visual FX and how the filmmakers sought to make a bigger sequel on a smaller budget. The Origin of the Feud explores the beginnings of the popular Richard Dawson-hosted game show... Actually, this 20-minute segment concentrates on why the filmmakers wanted UNDERWORLD's backstory to be the ""forestory"" in this entry; it also breaks down the film's major characters and interviews the actors who played them. Production design is a highlight of the UNDERWORLD series, so it's only appropriate that Dan Hennah's contributions are praised in Re-creating the Dark Ages: The Look of UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS. The talking heads here discuss the werewolf suits, CGI and sets--most importantly the vampire castle, whose Romanesque, 11th-century design is a departure from the Gothic architecture on view in the earlier movies. UNDERWORLD fans will probably appreciate this prequel more than the average moviegoer.",1242345600,,3674,5.228813559322034
3633507,1,B001HN697M,"First of all, the actor playing Lucien doesn't seem right for the part. In the first movie, when he started growling while transforming in that flashback scene, it looked silly rather than frightening. I think it's because the way he's made up, his forehead is too big, and his face is scrunched up under it. He doesn't radiate power or danger but looks more like a brainy type. I don't know if that was intentional in the casting, but it's weird.

Second, it's just boring. Although it was nice to see Tannis again, in his former glory. The plot moves too slowly, and the Victor chews the scenery with every line - always looks like his face muscles are about to pop out of his skin.

I got to where Lucien is waiting for whatshername at the clearing and I simply didn't care anymore. I hope it didn't get better after that, because I sent that DVD right back.",1242172800,3,861,4.408805031446541
3633508,3,B001HN697M,"I was pretty excited to finally see this after missing it in the theaters, but now I'm just disappointed. The back story of the Lycans is interesting and does shed some light on the feud between them and the vampires, but it seemed to me that the higher ups focused too much on special effects (which WERE rad) and not enough on plot substance. Some of the fight scenes had such quick camera and angle changes that they were hard to focus on, but I have to give them props for not having gratuitous nudity. The few scenes between Sonja and Lucian were kept in the same vein as the one between Celine and Michael in the last underworld. Overall, a ho-hum prequel that could've been a whole lot better but worth watching if you're an Underworld or fantasy fan.",1242172800,,758,4.421428571428572
3633509,4,B001HN697M,"I found the first Underworld picture to be a boring, derivative slight action picture with mild interest.  The sequel was an improvement due to it upping the excitement factor and unmuddling the storytelling.  Neither films were particularly memorable or original.  I always thought the idea of clashing these two mythic movie monsters was a novel idea.  Underworld was the first major picture in recent years to set it in motion, but was ultimately lackluster.  Unfortunately, the unforseen popularity of this series will prevent the story of Vampires vs. Werewolves from gracing the screen for a long while.

Now we come to the third Underworld sequel, a prequel, and we get what I've always longed for, a full on werewolf and vampire war by the hundreds.  We get gothic castles, swords and horses and leave out the pleather-clad super heroes that owed more to The Matrix then the concept would initially conclude.  Is this film great or wonderful?  No, not really.  It's by-the-numbers in it's origin tale and delivers the action the trailers and promotions promised.

One thing this prequel gets right that the previous films couldn't is the romance factor.  I really believed the two star crossed lovers in this film, unlike Beckinsale and Speedman's in the previous films which just seemed labored, and the two stars had no chemistry together.  You wanted less love and more action.  This film makes the relationship real and grand, and makes it worthy of a full-on war, as opposed to the film Troy which never really made you believe any war would be started over Helena.  The scene where the lovers are ultimately and permanately parted is truly well done and dramatic.  Good job.

The special effects, the real reason for these films to exist, are not up to par though.  There are some scenes and shots of fast moving hords of werewolves that just don't work.  They look animated and unrelated to the natural space they occupy.  Some of the slower motion CGI werewolves look convincing enough.  The practical on-set werewolves, like the previous films, are awesome and truly work.  No surprise there, the director of this sequel is Patrick Totopoulis, the prouduction and creature designer of the previous films(and many others including The Cave, Stargate, Independence Day, and Dark City).  He does a good job of directing here with what appears to be a much smaller budget than the last sequel's.

We get more traditional, and  ultimately appropriate gothic imagery and costumes that are really fun and effective.  The pallette, like the previous films, is monotone and chrome-blue.  The photography is dark, and since the film isn't going for scares, not too dark to muddle the images of action.  The action sequences themselves aren't that innovative.  They're the typical hack and slash and arrow penatrations we're used to seeing in these type of films, but I welcome them over the laborious task of sitting through one more bullet timed, slow-motion gun battle that instantly makes me want to go to sleep.

So, I give this film the highest rating of the Underworld series.  A series of films that isn't that good to begin with, and has somehow wormed it's way into the hearts of every 13 year old in America.  The story is clean and to the point.  The action is fun.  Most the special effects work.  The acting is all on spot.  Surprisingly, Rhona Mitra(Sonya) is very good in this film.  This actress started her career as the body model for the video game Tomb Raider and Kevin Bacon's rape victim in The Hollow Man, but she never really showed any real acting chops(including her lead role in last year's derivative Doomsday).  In this film she is quite good and hits the mark.  Bill Nighy is wonderfully evil and cold in this film.  Thankfully, he learned from his performance in the original Underworld to rope it in.  He was terrible in the first film, but is great in this one.  Go figure.

A definate rental.",1242172800,3,3933,4.851127819548872
3633510,4,B001HN697M,"I've read some critics' reviews of this prequel to the Underworld franchise that the story is redundant, yet I felt the story had enough substance in it even though much of the mythology of the feud between vampires and lycans had been touched upon in the previous Underworld movies.

In ""Rise of the Lycans"", the time period is possibly sometime in the Middle Ages, and set in some European country, in the wilds [with an intimidating vampire stronghold set against the backdrop of mountains and forests]. Viktor [a perpetually scowling Bill Nighy] reigns as vampire commander-in-chief over his coven, with his beloved daughter Sonja [Rhona Mitra] as a fiercely independent and strong-willed vampire who also happens to be in love with lycan Lucian [Michael Sheen, lately seen in Frost/Nixon]. The vampire-lycan relationship remains secret because it is forbidden, and for much of the movie, viewers are repeatedly made aware of this social stratification, i.e. vampires rule over everything [providing humans safety from the werewolves], hold lycans as slaves [Lucian is the first lycan, a human who is able to change into a werewolf and back into human form again], and the werewolves [who cannot assume human form] are the social outcasts or pariahs.

The love story of Sonja and Lucian is credibly portrayed [well, excepting one particularly wacky mountaintop sex scene] and Rhona Mitra plays an impressive Sonja for the most part, no small feat considering she's filling in the shoes of Kate Beckinsale [I know, they both portray different vampires, but one can't help compare them]. Rhona Mitra is gorgeous and fiery, but does get a bit passive towards the end, which kind of disappointed me.

Michael Sheen plays the angry lycan Lucian with competence and verve, and more than holds his own against vampire boss Viktor [Bill Nighy]. Their stand-offs are part of the high points of this instalment.

The weapons used in this prequel lack the sophistication of the previus Underworld movies but given the time frame, giant crossbows, and hands-on combat are inevitable and I must say, did not really disappoint.

The movie aside, the extras on this DVD are pretty impressive:
- Filmmakers' Commentary
- Underworld: Rise of the Lycans - From Script to Screen
- The Origin of the Feud - which includes interviews with Michael Sheen, Bill Nighy and Rhona Mitra about their respective roles in the film.
- Re-creating the Dark Ages - The Look of Underworld: Rise of the Lycans
- Music Video: ""Deathclub [Wes Borland/Reinholder Remix]"" by William Control Featuring Matt Skiba
- Previews [The Taking og Pelham 123, The International, Blood: The Last Vampire, 2012, Fixed Up!, Waltz with Bashir, The Informers, The Sky Crawlers, Quarantine, Resident Evil: Degeneration, What Goes Up, The Art of War III: Retribution, The Shield: Seasons 1-7, The Da Vinci Code:Extended Cut, The Devil's Tomb, The Grudge 3, and Messengers 2: The Scarecrow]

The audio options come in English, French, Spanish and Thai with subtitle options as well.

For what it's worth, I thought ""Rise of Lycans"" added more substance to the plot compared to the other two Underworld movies, which were bigger on action than actual story, and the acting in ""Rise of Lycans"" was credible and above average. I'd rank this as my second favorite Underworld movie after the first, and I look forward to seeing how they create a new story arc in the next instalment, if any.",1242086400,3,3433,5.044091710758377

I thought the story was good, yet the ending was disappointing. They should have come up with an ending that offered something new. Instead, they chose to bridge the ending (adding overdubbed dialog) with the first movie, Underworld, regarding Viktor and Selene's relationship.

3633512,4,B001HN697M,"The only people who seemed to be upset with this movie are the ones who obviously hadn't seen the previews. It was advertised as the prequel to the Underworld movies. It was advertised as the movie about the events before the other two Underworld movies. So there was obviously no real surprises if you have seen the other two movies. But that wasn't the point. It was meant to bring the story around full circle and give you a personal view of Sonja and Lucien. I loved it, personally. It was visually stunning and it did have a good plot and characters development and I was very pleased that they got the same actor to do Lucien. I was very impressed how they made events and timeline the same because it would have been noticeable if they hadn't (if you've seen the first two movies). I liked the actress that played Sonja and to those who complain that Selene wasn't in the movie...duh. It's a prequel, BEFORE Selene. BEFORE Michael. The only reason I gave this movie four stars instead of five is that the one sex scene in the movie was horrible cheesy and that Sonja wasn't blonde (like in Lucien's memories in the other two films). Small things, I know, but I am picky with particulars.  But all in all, I think it is a movie worth seeing. But I suggest not seeing it first. You should see the other two films before this one or else there are no surprises and the ""first"" Underworld movie, the one released first, would seem highly boring.

3633544,2,B001HN697M,"I would like let fellow reviewers know that I do not think this film is actually ""bad"". If I had to rate it as a film itself, without taking the series into consideration, I would rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 as maybe a 7.

But as a fan of the series, I was very disappointed to see that this film had no surprises. The point of a series prequel is to show you how the events in the film before were set in place. You are supposed to want to watch the prequel in order to solve these mysteries and know what happened. But unfortunately, that is not what you get in this case.

By the end of the first Underworld: here is what you already should know about the history of the Vampire vs. Lycan War:

1. The Lycans were slaves to the vampires, serving as manual labor or their ""daylight guardians"".
2. Lucian, the leader of the Lycans, fell in love with Sonja, Lord Victor's daughter, the leader of the vampires at the time. This was forbidden. Victor had a deep prejudice of Lycans.
3. Sonja and Lucian developed a relationship, resulting in Sonja's pregnancy.
4. Victor, believing this to be an abomination, sentenced his daughter to death by massive exposure to sunlight, and Lucian was forced to watch.
5. And then, Victor decided to kill the Lycans, and Lucian rallied Lycans to his cause, and therefore, a war started.

With few details omitted, that is essentially the plot of ""Rise of the Lycans"", and you've only seen the first ""Underworld"".

It is unfortunate that the makers of this film would follow this type of formula in order to spend little money and make a quick buck. Of course if you like the series, you're going to be drawn into seeing this movie, not to mention the ""goth-crowd"" that loves these films. And hey, if you don't like the plot, there is always the action.

Reportedly, this to be the third film in a trilogy. Since we all knew how the war started, why not continue the story from ""Underworld: Evolution""? I'd rather see what happens there.

3633546,2,B001HN697M,"Okay, so the first two UNDERWORLD movies weren't gold; in fact, I didn't like the second one at all.  But at the least first was what you expected of it: pure popcorn entertainment, with dazzling special effects, little in the way of real acting, a predictable plot, and a bunch of action (with some gratuitous sex thrown in for good measure).  It's not gonna win Oscars, but damned if it will ever bore you.

Well, UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS doesn't bore, either...but it's never what it could be.  Or, rather, what it SHOULD be.  We won't discuss the acting too much; Bill Nighy does the best with what he's given (talk about a great actor in a limited role), and Michael Sheen doesn't even seem to be trying much (can't blame him; watch FROST/NIXON to see this actor at his best).  Again, it's nothing to lament; you didn't expect Shakespeare, did you?  We even get the gratuitous sex, the dramatic violence, even a final ""hell yeah!"" moment between Sheen and Nighy.  And there's definitely a good story here, the clash between vampires and lycans.

The main default here are the special effects, or lack thereof.  This movie seems like it was made in the 80s, mid-90s at best.  It's such a disappointment; with better effects, the movie would at least have been engaging to an extent.  As is, UNDERWORLD: RISE OF THE LYCANS can't even seem to muster up that main prerequisite of horror/action shlock: dazzling special effects.

This third Underworld movie does it in a magnificent way: from the heightened feelings of love and hate, the pairings of life and death, to the escapist medieval setting with its castles and woods and ominous presences lurking in the shadows. It's a gothic story at its prime.
Performances are more than satisfactory; especially Sheen, who does a great job as our new-found hero Lucian. Special effects are stunning, especially considering the relative low budget of the production.

3633549,3,B001HN697M,"For ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans,"" Michael Sheen and Bill Nighy (both top-billed) come back as Lucian and Viktor, leaders of the two feuding clans - the Vampires and the Lycans, or werewolves. Being a prequel to the previously released ""Underworld"" (2003) and ""Underworld: Evolution"" (2006), the third installment of the ""Underworld"" saga will show us the origin of the century-long conflict between them.

Besides the fans of the ""Underworld"" franchise, those who haven't seen the previous installments can also enjoy the film as a stand-alone film. Set in medieval times, the story follows the Romeo and Juliet-like romance between Lucian (Michael Sheen), a young werewolf and slave of the aristocratic vampires, and Sonja (Rhona Mitra), daughter of Viktor (Bill Nighy) the leader of the Vampires. And of course there are actions, too.

Steven Mackintosh as Tannis and Kevin Grevioux as Raze reprise their roles in the previous installments. Kate Beckinsale, who played Selene, appears briefly as a cameo.

The fans of the ""Underworld"" series may not agree with me, but the story of ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" falters at times, due to the confusing relations between the Vampires and the Lycans, and some scenes that drag on (Sonja's ""love scene"" for instance). Once the film sets up the storyline for Lucian, Sonja and Viktor, however, the film becomes easier to follow with several decent battle actions.

""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" is helmed by first-time director Patrick Tatopoulos, who is better known for his works as creature designer. Though he is not bad as film director who can shoot action scenes very well, he is not the best storyteller either. Overall, the film is fairly entertaining, but with better storytelling this could have been much better.",1239062400,3,1781,5.173611111111111
3633550,4,B001HN697M,For all the fans that love Underworld and Vampires this will be an enjoyable movie.  If you are a stickler on the little tings like me you will find some inconsistantcies in this movie and the flashbacks/stories told in the first two. They should not have used Kate Beckinsale as Victor's daughter. She could have been in the movie but she looked nothing like Victor's duaghter from the clips in the other movie. Also the flashbacks about the capturing of William in the woods from the first movie was different from the tale told in this the latest installment.,1238198400,,562,4.6767676767676765
3633551,5,B001HN697M,"This was a good prequel, but it wasn't a great one.  There should've been more info on the love affair between Lucian and Sonja...but there wasn't.  Sonja's character should've been developed more...but it wasn't.  Lastly, they killed her too quickly.  Her death should've been more tragic than it was...but it wasn't.  Still in all, I liked the movie and would recommend it to any fan of the Underworld franchise.",1236643200,,414,4.942028985507246
3633552,5,B001HN697M,"I adored the first Underworld because of Lucian, played by Michael Sheen and of course Selene, played by Kate Beckinsale. To see Lucian's story in its entirety is such a treat, and the story, direction and acting was genuinely moving. Michael Sheen is brilliant in this film, and I must say whenever he plays Lucian I love the way he looks! I was in tears watching this one play out, well done and I cannot wait to own it!",1235001600,,422,4.3544303797468356
3633573,4,B001HN697M,"Seeing current movies these days is a challenge with a very active toddler.  When Valentine's Day came around, we dropped our son off with my parents and I let my wife pick the movie.  She of course picked the ""vampire movie."" Which is why I love my wife.

As a big fan of Kate Beckinsale and the World of Darkness role-playing game, the Underworld series quickly became a favorite.  It featured big budget special effects, lots of PVC and leather, and plenty of pouty vampires.  It also featured a battle between vampires and werewolves, a concept that was so prominent in White Wolf's World of Darkness series that it sparked a lawsuit.

Despite the lawsuit, Underworld continues to forge its own path, such that it now has prequels.  You know your movie franchise has made it when executives are willing to pay to produce what is essentially a history book.  Fortunately, this bit of history is actually worth watching.

Werewolves and vampires have always been a bit of a mixed bag in Hollywood.  The fact that Dracula could turn into a wolf seems to be one of the less plausible aspects of vampirism that were dropped in favor of the Ricean pouty goth. Thus the ability to transform into a wolf is exclusively the domain of the werewolf.  But it wasn't always this way.

The vrykolakas, draws its name from ""vryk,"" meaning ""wolf"" and lakas, meaning ""fur"" in modern Slavic languages clearly meant ""werewolf.""  Vrykolakas in other countries, however, is used to describe vampires.  This is because of the aforementioned ability of a vampire to turn into a wolf, which can be strictly interpreted as meaning that all vampires are actually werewolves.

Underworld: Rise of the Lycans turns this confusion into a plot.  In short, vampires and werewolves are descended from the same bloodline, but the vampires have risen to the role of aristocrat while werewolves are little more than beasts.  Or at least, that's what the vampires believe.  To that end, Viktor (Bill Nighy) the vampire lord treats domesticated werewolf Lucian (Michael Sheen) as his foster son, giving him blacksmith duties that ensure werewolves don't transform with inward-pointing spiked collars.  But Viktor's benevolence has limits, and when he discovers that Lucian is having a dalliance with his daughter Sonja (the delectable Rhona Mitra, who still isn't quite Beckinsale but comes pretty darn close), he teaches Lucian a terrible lesson.  What Viktor underestimates is the kinship that Lucian has with his wilder brethren, a kinship that will spark class warfare.

Rise of the Lycans is basically what you get when you give a serious goth injection to the elves from Lord of the Rings, rehash the plot from Romeo and Juliet, and steal the feudal arrangement of vampires and their human ""cattle"" from the World of Darkness series. Nobody speaks in contractions.  Everything is viewed through a dark blue lens. And lots of limbs get hacked off.

The real story here is the werewolves.  It's their class struggle, after all, and the movie never shies away from the dire consequences of the characters' actions.  There is a high enough body count on both sides to make Shakespeare proud.

Vampires.  Werewolves. Vampires and werewolves killing each other. Two star-crossed lovers bound by their family allegiances and the curse of their blood.  What more could you ask for in a Valentine's Day date movie?",1235001600,60,3378,4.962633451957295
3633574,5,B001HN697M,"We all know from previous Underworld movies, that Viktor killed his beloved daughter, Sonja because of her relationship with a Lycan, Lucian (Michael Sheen). So, while this installment didn't offer anything new in terms of storyline, it did allow us to see Sonja through Lucian's and her father's eyes.  It also allowed us the opportunity to see Lucian's rise to be ""pact leader"", but we saw some of the other characters that appear in later Underworld movies (Raze & Tannis), and came to a greater understanding about the divide between the species.

Viktor, the leader of a Vampire clan is determined to use the ""werewolves/Lycans"" (who he believes are savages and just need to be controlled) as slaves, protectors and workers, all while controlling the humans and remaining one of the most dangerous leaders on the counsel.  Viktor believes that controlling these mindless creatures and imprisoning them will strengthen his rule. His favorite ""pet"" is the strong minded Lucian, a Lycan, who can control his turns from human to werewolf, and who is secretly in love with his daughter, the very independent Sonja. Believing that she has betrayed him (by mingling with the Lycans) and their kind (Vampires), Viktor decides that her demise is the only answer. Of course, Lucian fuelled by revenge, sorrow and regret responds with a swift attack, and soon learns that he has control over both those who are deemed wild and those who welcome leadership.  We are soon privy to a battle between the two species that will go down in vamp/were history and prove to be foreshadowing for the Underworld series. And of course the movie ends with the beginning of the Underworld series and a glimpse of Selena (the very beautiful Kate Beckinsale), revisiting the tale.

I enjoyed this prequel to the Underworld series. I thought that Rhona Mitra's portrayal of Sonja was brilliant (and she definitely favors Beckinsale), and what isn't there to love about the brooding Bill Nighy who is all too real in as Viktor (I think he is the best vamp ever) and the long suffering Michael Sheen, who is the only person that I could see ever playing Lucian. I am even hoping to visit Underworld one more time. After all, I am sure that Selena and Michael could fight evil one more time.",1234915200,3,2264,4.8549222797927465
3633575,5,B001HN697M,"I really liked this movie a lot I liked how they explained Lucian's story I think they need to make one with Selene's story and Also one with how William and Marcus became a lycan and vampire.

There was a lot of action which was a good part of the movie the war starting was really neat to see also I also liked how they kept the movie in the med evil times with the castle and people dressing like knights.",1234569600,,408,4.037037037037037
3633576,5,B001HN697M,I am a big fanatic about werewolfs and This is another movie to add to the classics I think.  it gives another look at werewolves that is not mentioned or thought of in most stories and movies.  I love the lighting throughout the whole movie.  it was beautiful.  I was driving home after watching it the moon lit everything just like the movie and I just was hopping to hear some howling!!,1234137600,8,389,4.361111111111111
3633577,4,B001HN697M,"Hundreds of years before the first ""Underworld"" movie, werewolves were slaves to the vampires, led by Viktor (Nighy).  The werewolf Lucian (Sheen) is the favored slave of Viktor.  They maintain a respectable relationship despite their differences.  Unbeknownst to Viktor, Lucian and Viktor's daughter Sonja (Mitra) are in love.  They sneak off to be together even though relationships between vampires and warewolves  is forbidden.  Their relationship prompts Lucien to remove his collar and go after when she is in danger.  Despite saving her, Lucien is punished like the rest of the warewolves.  This plants the seeds for their uprising.

""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" is a movie that probably does not need to be made.  The story was laid out quickly in the first ""Underworld"" movie.  That being said, ""Rise of the Lycans"" is surprisingly entertaining.  Nighy and Sheen are doing the overacting that fans of the series have come to love.  There are plenty of actions scenes.  And, this time, the film is a bit of a period piece.  Shakespeare this ain't, but I do not think that fans of the series will be disappointed.",1233446400,,1124,5.0
3633578,4,B001HN697M,"There have already been many reviews on this movie complaining about this, that and the other and if you wanted to dismember it piece by piece, I'm sure you could also find a lot to pick fault with. Instead though, let's look at what the movie achieves for its targeted audience. A presquel? Seems to be the popular way these days with a good franchise, if you can't move the story forward, move it back, and give us some history. Strange that I thought that had been covered in some detail in the 1st and 2nd movie, but I digress.
Those thinking they will be disappointed by the exclusion of the lovely leather clad Kate Beckinsale as Selene, will not be too unhappy with Rhona Mitra (Doomsday/Shooter). She smolders more than sizzles, but definitely adds some sexual tension, as Viktor's hard to control daughter Sonja (remember the one who Selene reminded him off in the first movie?). Also back is Michael Sheen (fresh from playing David Frost, and English PM Tony Blair) with washboard abs, tight pants and AC/DC's old stage wardrobe as head of the Lycans - Lucien. Best of all of course, is we get lots and lots of Bill Nighy as Viktor. Machiavellian, brutal, sadistic and full of charm. You get a real sense that he loves playing the villain, with an almost campy panache. Visually, it's a little tighter, Patrick Tatapoulos takes over as Director from Len Wiseman. Not that this matters much, as neither of them have much sensibility when it comes to monsters and Sfx.
So anyway, the story - well you don't need to know really, Vampires, Werewolves, Swords, Sex & Action. This was not intended to test the grey matter and usually a movie franchise gets weaker with each installment, but that's not the case here, as there is an almost fresh feel to the story, even though we're retreading old ground so to speak. It IS entertaining, and it will do just that if you can suspend your disbelief enough.
Great fun 4 stars, just ask yourself 3 questions as the credits roll:
1) Why don't the Lycans attack while the sun is shining
2) How come all these immortals seem to be easily dispatched with swords?
3) And how come there is a full moon EVERY night?",1233187200,,2157,4.576227390180879
3633579,5,B001HN697M,I won't go into great detail as some previous revewiers did an excellent job. Underworld Rise of the Lycans is a must see for any Lucian fan like myself. I can honestly say I like this one just as much (maybe a bit more)then the first Underworld movie. Great Love scene between Lucian and Sonja and great fighting scenes as well. Excellent movie!  I can't wait for it to be on DVD!!!,1232928000,,383,4.319444444444445
3633580,4,B001HN697M,"Anyone who has seen the previous movies in the Underworld series will be pleased with this prequel.  It competently adds flare to the story, and fills in details that do nothing but accentuate the action and plot of the Underworld timeline.

Covens of vampires were once the dominant species.  They were the upper tier in a social structure that placed humans as secondary, and werewolves, animals incapable of controlling their transformation to and from human form, as wild, untamed beasts.  When Lucian (Michael Sheen) was born, however, he became a new breed, a missing link between human and werewolf, a sentient being capable of reason as well as controlling transformation; he was the first Lycan.

Eventually, Lucian is thought of as a hybrid pet/soldier.  The vampires' great plan, in large part due to their leader Viktor (Bill Nighy), is to utilize the Lycans as soldiers, intelligent guard dogs.  When Lucian and his brethren grow weary of their third-class status - not to mention Lucian's budding romance with Viktor's daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra) - rebellion is afoot.  And by rebellion I mean all out war, bloody battle, beheadings and deadly accurate mega-crossbows that create Lycan-skewers.  The sword combat comprises the majority of the inter-species hostility.  Each vampire carries an Arthurian demeanor as they kill and decapitate with Claymores and Zweihanders, while showing nothing but stoic countenance.  The Lycans' fighting style, on the other hand, is more visceral, nearly feral, as they attack with ferociousness verging on animal instinct.

Aside from the nonstop action that comprises the majority of this film, the underlying tones of racial and social status are perhaps the most powerful.  All the vampires are ghostly white, with overtly beautiful features.  The werewolves are clearly the darker species - growling, snarling, mindlessly rampaging.  In the racial middle are the Lycans - humans make up the social middle - determined to rise above their imprisonment, their slavery, and prove their equivalence.

All vampire aficionados will love this movie.  It's dark, foreboding, and saturated with violence, despite missing some of the orthodox vampire lore.  The lighting and coloring are superb, dark blues complimenting the castles, forests, and cave dwellings of the socially inequal species.  Additionally, the connection to the other movies is seamless.  Great addition to the series.",1232841600,3,2433,5.403183023872679
3633581,5,B001HN697M,"Rise of the Lycans is over the top and filled with high drama.

It is slightly different than the first two underworlds and dare I say superior. This one takes place in the middle ages.

If you enjoy time period movies and non-stop action and drama then you should really like Rise of the Lycans.

During the movie I wished for more character development of the Lycans.  Like in the other underworld movies you see the werewolves attacking haphazardly at random times. You also see a lot of focus on the vampires.

I think Rise of the Lycans is a bit more entertaining and dramatic than the first two and therefore deserves a 5 star rating.",1232841600,,640,4.482758620689655
3633582,4,B001HN697M,"For those who actually wanted to see some of the back-stories alluded to in the first two ""Underworld"" films, you should find ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" to be very helpful. This prequel not only visualizes the beginning of the blood feud between the Vampires and the Lycans, it also tells the story of Lucian (Michael Sheen), a Lycan of unknown parentage who would become the most powerful leader of his clan centuries later. For those who were never into the films to begin with, you might find that this new film actually has something to offer. It's not a masterpiece by any means, but it delivers exactly as it promises: It's a supernatural action film that gives us no more nor less than a vampire underworld and a Lycan uprising. If you were hoping for a fable that's just as complex as it is frightening, might I suggest you stop reading this review?

One of the reasons I enjoyed this movie is that it takes place in the Dark Ages. The first two films took place in the present day (respective to when they were theatrically released), where vampire and werewolf clans coexisted with concrete structures, high-tech guns, and subway stations. It was a blending that was too bizarre for its own good. But in the context of immense stone fortresses, no electricity, filthy dungeons, medieval weaponry, and dense forests populated by peasant folk ... well, it just feels right. It helps that practically every scene is engulfed in shadow, effectively muting the visuals to shades of blue and gray. The color scheme establishes mood so well that it's hard to dismiss it as mere eye candy.

The back-story: Centuries before he became obsessed with the bloodline of Alexander Corvinus, Lucian was unceremoniously born in a dungeon. The cruel Vampire elder, Viktor (Bill Nihy), spared Lucian but killed his parents, making him the first second-generation Lycan allowed to live. When it flashes forward to Lucian's teenage years, we see him defeating a number of ruthless Death Dealers. This impresses Viktor so much that he immediately devises a plan: He will create a new generation of Lycans to guard the Vampire coven from outside forces. With the help of a silver-barbed collar, they will be ""civilized"" Lycans. They will not be like their ""wild"" counterparts that roam the forests as wolves, unable to assume a human form.

Now we get to the story proper. Unbeknownst to Viktor, his headstrong daughter, Sonja (Rhona Mitra), has fallen in love with Lucian. Complicating matters is the fact that Lucian is planning on escaping, and he wants Sonja to run away with him; she loves him with all her heart, but there are times when she feels duty-bound to secure the legacy of the coven. She's willful and independent, much to the chagrin of her father, who relies on his conniving right-hand man, Vampire historian Andreas Tanis (Steven Mackintosh), to keep a close eye on her. As he stealthily observes Sonja and Lucian, it becomes clear that a Lycan uprising is in the works, Lucian having won the support of his fellow slaves.

Now that I've described the plot, I realize that I've been writing under the assumption that you're familiar with the ""Underworld"" series. If you're not, if you've never heard of Lycans or Alexander Corvinus or any other character I've mentioned, chances are ""Rise of the Lycans"" will not do very much for you. That's the inherent problem with prequels: They assume audiences are familiar with will happen later in the story. But since I am familiar with the film series, I was able to enjoy this film, mostly for its stylistic approach. The story, I admit, is fairly run-of-the-mill, giving us nothing new in the way of character development or theme. Consider the fact that the feud between the Vampires and the Lycans is essentially a commentary on intolerance and cultural understanding; I've seen such commentaries before, even as recently as another werewolf fable, ""Blood and Chocolate."" Still, ""Rise of the Lycans"" makes the most of what little it has, so in that sense, the film succeeds.

Noticeably absent from ""Rise of the Lycans"" is Kate Beckinsale, whose character apparently wasn't born when the story took place (or maybe she was--I can never tell when it comes to Vampires). Rhona Mitra does a fairy decent job assuming the female lead, however, and this is despite the fact that she isn't given much to do other than be Michael Sheen's love interest. Sheen himself does an adequate job as Lucian, a character I could never quite put my finger on in the previous two films. Bill Nighy doesn't stretch too far for his role, but then again, he doesn't have to; for the purposes of this story, Viktor need not be more or less than a classic, uncomplicated villain. One look into his obvious, piercing blue eyes will convince you that the writers never wanted to delve too deeply. The same can be said for the film as a whole. ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" is a film meant to be enjoyed at face value. There's no point in trying to look past its gothic atmosphere when that's all you were meant to see.",1232841600,,5056,4.793577981651376
