6454718,4,B00KZJX8KU,"It's pretty good!  Really! I like the dialogue and the places the movie takes the audience.  If you are looking for a scare without investing any time or thought, then this is not really the movie for you.  If you watch it and feel like thinking a bit then you probably will like it.  Think David Lynch not Eli Roth :)",1488758400,,318,4.163934426229508
6454719,1,B00KZJX8KU,I would walk out of this movie on an airplane. This one really put the X in SUX.,1482796800,3,80,3.5
6454720,5,B00KZJX8KU,Shame it seems so rare; it's nice to find a film that has a grand uniqueness to it!  I read about it in Fangoria and it really grabbed my attention; I was not disappointed!,1440979200,2,172,4.0588235294117645
6454721,5,B00KZJX8KU,"The special effects are a concentrated and respectable blend of standard CGI paranormal visuals and practical effects. The fact that the story sets a tone similar to the awesome Japanese paranormal horror films makes this palatable. The scares are definite, undeniable moments that get you. The atmosphere is a creepy mix of giallo styled dark and light balance with soft glows of color leaking into the frames. The creature effects is impactful, with some truly disturbing aesthetics begging for your nightmares. Who cares about that girl in the well, this b*tch on the highway is the real horror.

""Devil's Mile"" is a definite must watch movie that shows just how perfect O'Brien's choice to make this his directorial debut was, not only for him but all us horror fans. If it wasn't for the beginning feeling stereotypical, and slow, then this film would have been a masterpiece of modern horror. Still this is one d*mn good movie. The ending is expected but not in the way that you really expect to see. Can't really detail anything because it would only spoil the experience.",1431475200,2,1079,4.896174863387978
6454722,1,B00KZJX8KU,stupid effing movie avoid this crap at all  costs .......i was not that lucky,1426982400,2,77,4.5

6454724,5,B00KZJX8KU,"I was skeptical at first, but when I finally watched the film I thought I was great in it!

David Hayter",1410825600,9,104,3.9523809523809526
6454725,3,B00KZJX8KU,"Toby (David Hayter), Cally (Maria del Mar) and Jacinta (Casey Hudecki) have kidnapped 2 students (one is the wrong one) and have taken a short cut down a highway that seems endless. They stop at a store, not run by Sid Haig, but it becomes apparent we are in for another Hell's Highway, Purgatory Road, Twilight Zone episode with elements of Dante and Japanese horror tossed at us.

Unfortunately they couldn't improve on the basic formula and used witty dialogue like, ""Can you get sunspots at night?"" The cast and special effects weren't bad, it was just that the story didn't go anywhere by design.

Should make due as a Redbox rental.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1409961600,3,681,4.705882352941177
6454726,2,B00KZJX8KU,"A man and two women embark on a dark, lonely road with two women they've kidnapped, who are tied and in the trunk of the car. The road seems to never end. Sound Familiar? Well, then things start happening when some start getting killed. There is plenty of blood and the ""f"" word, They even realize they kidnapped the wrong girl! I took a wild guess at the ending and was wrong, but take it from me, this movie is not worth the price.",1407888000,4,433,4.166666666666667
6454736,4,B00KZJX8KU,"""When things go badly, we tell ourselves God is testing us""! Great horror flick with a surprise ending... well worth the watch!",1508371200,,127,4.818181818181818
6454737,5,B00KZJX8KU,well done for a budget horror/suspense movie. good acting and well thought out. worth the time.,1507680000,,95,5.0
6454738,3,B00KZJX8KU,"Because that was half of the dialogue. Nonetheless, if you stick through to the end, there is a nice payoff",1507680000,,107,4.4
6454739,5,B00KZJX8KU,"I expected a cheap horror thrill, wasn't sure even in the beginning, but as time went on and plot thickened - my interest intensified. In the end, being on the spiritual side, I can say that this film is a masterpiece. Scary and with meaning. For optimal results, as with any horror film - watch alone at night in complete darkness ;) I don't rate five stars easily, even with the biggest budget a movie can be totally empty and uninteresting.",1507248000,,443,4.481481481481482
6454740,4,B00KZJX8KU,Started out a little cheesy but if you really pay attention the movie turned out to be really good better than I thought,1507161600,,120,4.260869565217392
6454741,5,B00KZJX8KU,"Definitely not what I was expecting: something lame to pass the time. Low budget to be sure. Still, I enjoy'd it as much as I enjoy'd Seven Pounds and Memento.",1507161600,,159,4.333333333333333
6454742,5,B00KZJX8KU,Good movie. Went five stars to counter the one star retards.,1506816000,,60,4.545454545454546
6454743,5,B00KZJX8KU,"So not what I expected.  Was expecting a slasher/ paranormal flick with a final girl ending.  However there were so many twists and ""oh yea now that makes sense"" moments.  Grabs your attention and keeps it  I was impressed by the acting, directing, and effects.  So often what could be a good movie is missing something and makes it an epic fail instead of a hit! Definitely would recomment this movie for lovers of horror, thrillers, and the paranormal! Enjoy!",1506556800,,461,4.7125
6454744,4,B00KZJX8KU,"I'm fond of horror ""road"" movies, even the horrible ones (they make good white noise while I do other things). Although not perfect, Devil's Mile was much better than I expected: I enjoyed the little twists and turns they added to a familiar trope. It's low-budget, of course, but the cast and crew clearly tried hard to make something of quality and didn't just phone it in like so many other of these flicks. I recommend this to anyone who likes deadly road movies and/or fans of the paranormal.",1505433600,,497,4.595505617977528
6454745,2,B00KZJX8KU,I am only writing this review because it was listed on my recommendations list. I am not watching anything at this time with a horror designation.,1504310400,,146,4.653846153846154
8662838,5,B00KZJX8KU,great,1521676800,,5,5.0
8662839,4,B00KZJX8KU,"Starts slow then pulls you in.
Proof you don't need to spend the gross national product of a small country to create a good movie.

Maybe a little rough around the edges but overall an excellent horror flick with a satisfying twist ending.",1510963200,,239,4.558139534883721
8662840,2,B00KZJX8KU,the other movie grudge or the ring. Heck they prob used the same creeper girl. But the movie just wasn't good. Had it been better written and better acting... maybe.,1510617600,,165,4.533333333333333
8662841,4,B00KZJX8KU,It was a 3 star up until the ending. Not bad but not spectacular. The ending though...pretty good. Twist with a twist. This is a hidden gem. The reviews are legit for this movie. It's pretty good.,1510617600,,196,4.324324324324325
8662842,4,B00KZJX8KU,"Brutal and bloody, so if you don't like that move on.  I liked this movie.  I didn't think it started out slow.  The acting wasn't that bad a little stilted here and there but the two main actresses were really good.  The story was also good.  I enjoyed this horror/syfy. Low budget but good.  It was worth a watch.",1510617600,,315,4.254237288135593
8662843,3,B00KZJX8KU,"Actually not overly bad, acting left a little to be desired and it was low budget so the visuals aren't all that great, but the story was interesting and a very nice plot twist!",1510531200,,177,4.235294117647059
8662844,5,B00KZJX8KU,"Well done! Great atmosphere for just a stretch of pavement, two vehicles, and one really dark night. The monster effects were very unsettling. Glad I gave it a try, thanks previous reviews!",1510358400,,189,4.9375
8662845,4,B00KZJX8KU,"Short and sweet, yes, this is a low budget film. Yes, it can be cheesy at times. Yes, I believe that is THE David Hayter of MGS: Solid fame. But if you watch the film through to the end, it has one doozy of a twist. The casting isn't bad either, Maria del Mar is good but under used. Amanda Joy and Samantha Wan are believable for what the film asks of them. Casey Hudecki is really good to the extent that I'm surprised I haven't seen her in more lead roles and Frank Moore definitely played his part well being the resident crime boss/scumbag. Those two characters alone could warrant a sequel/prequel to explain a few things left out of this film as well as explain the wall. But it's the ending in combination with the casting that takes a pedestrian horror film and transforms it into something worth watching. I don't think I'd watch it again though.",1509667200,,856,4.389937106918239
8662846,1,B00KZJX8KU,"I like Suspense, Thrillers, Action/Adventure, and even SciFi. I do not care for Horror unless it's REALLY good. This was not remotely good, in my opinion. It was contrived and predictable. I mean gosh, the Japanese girl turns into the monster from The Grudge, complete with creaky door sound effects. Who could've seen THAT coming? But really, Amazon could have spared this poor movie my opinions, if only they would learn to put them in the correct category. Another 90 minutes I'll never get back. Thanks again, Amazon.",1509494400,3,521,4.931818181818182
8662847,5,B00KZJX8KU,"Damn! This film is almost every genre- horror, mystery, drama, psychological thriller, sci-fi, perhaps documentary lol. Definitely not romance-comedy. It's unique, well scripted, terrific actors, especially since I'm personally tired of the pretentious, contrived and banality of Hollywood and over-rated celebrities. Possibly believable- if one believes in karma, and justice well-deserved. I recommend this with 5 stars, because so many Oscar winning movies can be over-rated.",1508889600,,478,6.257575757575758
