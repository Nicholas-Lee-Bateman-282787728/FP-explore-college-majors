1350249,2,B00004TITO,"Despite the two stars I enjoyed this paranoiac whodunit that says a lot about how we are still haunted by Big Brother conspiracy theories, yet enjoy revenge on the puppet masters.",1425081600,,179,4.806451612903226
1350250,3,B00004TITO,Johnny Lee Miller  is  very  watchable  as  usual.  I'm  not  a  big  mystery fan  but  this  was  interesting  with  good  character development,1410912000,,145,4.863636363636363
1350251,4,B00004TITO,"Interesting story-line, complex plot, thoroughly likeable but somewhat reprehensible anti-hero, the sex was there to shock not to add to the story and it was a bad decision by the director, the language was a bit rough, all in all much to criticize and much to like I enjoyed the movie even while wincing at some of the content.",1387152000,10,328,4.576271186440678
1350252,3,B00004TITO,"'Complicity' may have been a great book, but the film leaves something, it drags at times. There are great performances by the actors, but the film lost my interest midway. I forced myself to finish viewing the film so I would know what is was all about.

Cameron Colley, played superbly by Jonny Lee Miller, is a journalist for a Caledonian newspaper. He is an anti-hero, using illegal drugs and sleeping with his best friend's wife. Within the story of Cameron's personal life there are a series of murders of well known men of questionable character.

It's difficult not to give too much away but as Cameron follows leads given to him by a Mr Archer, a man who calls him with clues to these murders, he becomes too involved in the murders and the police start asking questions. Gratuitous sex scenes, so not applicable for anyone under 18.

This was a convoluted and complex film that lost my interest partway through. I am an Iain Banks fan, but somehow missed this particular novel.

Read the book, skip the film. prisrob 07-05-13",1372982400,7,1035,4.670329670329671

1350254,2,B00004TITO,"No opinion, since it's not in region 1, but it takes time to convert regions, I guess.  I'm sure it's a great movie, once I get to view it.  If I don't buy it somewhere else and it goes to Region 1, I'll give another review.",1336089600,,224,3.847826086956522
1350255,4,B00004TITO,"While any film adaptation of a novel necessarily loses scenes and condenses characters, Complicity (or Retribution in the US) stays true to the heart of the story told by Iain Banks back in the early 90s. Jonny Lee Miller (of Trainspotting) does a fine job as Cameron Colley, a cynical leftist investigative reporter in Scotland who becomes linked with a series of deaths which have occurred across the country after he had written a scathing article which called for the violent deterrence of so-called white collar criminals such as corrupt politicians, arms dealers, and corporate raiders. Is Colley the killer or has he been framed? This film is a stylish mix of suspense, mystery, humor, and a little bit of kink, and I highly recommend it and the novel it was based on, Complicity by Iain Banks.",1180828800,19,801,4.854014598540146
1350256,2,B00004TITO,"Aside from the difficulty in understanding the Scottish dialogue, and what turns out to be a slightly forgettable, muddled plot, the performances are what carry this movie forward. Jonny Lee Miller, as always, is incredible. Though he's lost some of his thin faced freshness, he still has an appeal that remains universal. He and his co-stars do an admirable job with less than great material, but in the end (and at the end) what good's a movie unless you're kept interested. An unexpected, fairly dumb ending. 2 outta 5.",1062547200,3,522,4.876404494382022

1350259,2,B00004TITO,"The story line was complicated, a little interesting, creepy with some gross scenes, and it wasn't easy to follow. The movie made some points about the immoral actions of business worlds. There is some quality to much of the film, so if a viewer doesn't mind gross blood scenes, molesting scene, and kinky sex, and a generally difficult to follow plot, this film might deserve a higher rating than a two. But, if you find those things disturbing, well then this movie shouldn't be considered entertainment and the rating could be lower.",1466294400,,536,4.836956521739131

1350263,3,B00004TITO,"When a man's past comes back to haunt him, bodies start to pile up. Not your usual British mystery (and definitely R rated for language, nudity and sex), but intriguing nonetheless. Johnny Lee Miller (currently on TV as Sherlock Holmes in ""Elementary"") is a Scottish reporter who gets anonymous phone calls with hints and leads about a string of mysterious deaths. Eventually he is framed for some of these but manages at the end to help the police solve the serial murders-disguised-as-suicides. In between these activities, he drinks, does drugs and has dangerous, somewhat freaky sex with a married woman. If you like your mysteries hard boiled, gritty, and a bit sordid, but still British, this one's for you.",1463011200,,713,5.0

1350283,3,B00004TITO,"I had some time to kill one evening when my husband and I were out of town and he was watching a game on the hotel TV, and I had finished the book I had been reading, so I thought I'd give this a try on Amazon Prime. It really wasn't that good, but I was curious to see Johnny Lee Miller in a different role than the one he plays as Sherlock Holmes on TV.  In this movie, he is much younger and plays a journalist being  contacted by some wacko who is killing people.  Of course, the wacko is setting him up so the police don't believe him and it begins to look as though he, the journalist, is behind the killings, etc.  So, I guess if you like murder mysteries and you don't mind heavy Scottish and English accents (I used the cc in order to understand them), and you're not looking for the perfect murder movie (it's very far from perfect), then you could give this a try. Otherwise, you may want to spend your time on more worthwhile endeavors.",1446249600,,948,4.135869565217392
