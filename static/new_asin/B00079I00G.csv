8046263,4,B00079I00G,Adorable video.  The story is sweet.  The only issue I have is the part where the mother is extremely angry at the dog.  The aggressive dialogue was upsetting to some of my students.  I had to skip that part when showing it a second time.  The rest is lovely and held a beautiful lesson.,1524787200,,287,4.2407407407407405
