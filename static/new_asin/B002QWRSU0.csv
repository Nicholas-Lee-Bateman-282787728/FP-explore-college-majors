3968993,5,B002QWRSU0,"Shaahin Cheyene's film ""Serpent and the Sun"" really blew me away.

I have always been interested in the ancient mayans, toltecs and aztecs civilizations and had no idea that their culture is still alive today although rarely seen. This documentary explores the life of the Medicine Man from ancient times to the present in a really interesting manner, by using the story of an apprenticing toltec priest.

The editing is stellar and the use of graphics and visual motion is amazing!",1265068800,3,482,4.938271604938271

3968995,3,B002QWRSU0,This is not the kind of film for someone that would like to know more about the old shamanic tradition of the aztec.  It is not a documentary but more like an acted out documentary.  Even though it has some interesting things to offer it is treated in a very superficial way and the actors suck.,1428624000,,295,4.25

3968999,5,B002QWRSU0,"Very original ! I really enjoyed the fact that Miktlan explained the virtues needed to become a true Mexican Healer. Miktlan's additional tool's; the language, the spiritual exercises, the breathing excercises and physical excercises are also essential to the apprentice becoming a conscious healer. The observations and participation the apprentice needed to experience his own healing and clearing his own body, mind and spirit before healing others are an important fact for being a healer.",1389657600,,493,5.586666666666667
3969000,5,B002QWRSU0,If Informational and amazing. It tells a different tale on the people who are Aztec healers doctors. It made me wonder more about the healers and there life's the live,1376006400,,167,4.6
3969001,3,B002QWRSU0,"First of all let me say that this documentary does break the mold. It is not your average documentary. The filiming is beautiful and it really does create a doorway into what Carlos Casteneda would call a ""non-ordinary reality"" however it is heavily focused on the last living Aztec medicine man and does not nearly talk about all of the great Mayan elders and their wisdom. It's  one of the better 2012 Aztec films out there but don't expect it to be a Mayapolooza.",1352160000,,466,4.5476190476190474
3969002,5,B002QWRSU0,"Very inspiring and profound movie!

I never looked at darkness as a positive aspect within us and have usually run away from it - your film helps me to realize the gifts you can find from it and the power of looking within at all times.

Thank you!!!",1317600000,,250,4.1875
3969003,5,B002QWRSU0,"Shaahin Cheyene's Serpent and the Sun captivated me in the first five minutes and didn't let me go until the credits rolled - at which point my mind was racing with emotions and thoughts.

The story told is both important and fascinating, and serves as a refreshing reminder that while Western culture has physically manifested itself on the land and society of the North American continent - in the form of buildings, technology, political and medical systems etc - just 13 generations ago this expanse was home to an equally respectable Aztec nation-state. And while Spanish imperialists destroyed that state, the nation - a concord of people unified in blood and culture - remains.

The film, to my surprise, revealed that today, in 2011, while culturally overlooked by most of the world, there are over 1 million genetic and cultural descendants of the Aztec Empire living in Mexico City - embedded their hearts and minds a highly-enlightened and authentic worldview whose perspectives on life, medicine, spirituality, the human body, nature, the universe, math, science, logic, morality, and religion seem to form a more complete understanding of the universe than contemporary western culture permits.

Director Shaahin Cheyene brilliantly takes the viewer into an otherwise overlooked people, and shares the wisdom of the Aztecs, particularly on health and wellness, as told through their voices. Medicine, shamanism, herbalism, spirituality, morality, balance, and laws of life; the Aztec culture has much to teach, and Cheyene lucidly presents some of their ways in this treasure of a film that left me in a state of elation - pondering the innate subjectivity of my own worldview that has been shaped by my life in America, and rapt by the enduring Aztec ethos.

While science, materialism, capitalism, industrialism, and urbanism have provided for a high per capital GDP in America, I walked away from this film thinking that our entire culture may simply be missing something - missing a collective awareness that we came from the Earth, and our bodies are made of cells just like trees and birds; that nature, spirit and the human body are intrinsically connected in a vast harmonic order, and if we choose to see beyond the psychological and spiritual fog of material obstructions, we will find a pure and near-flawless system that far exceeds man's capacity to fabricate.

This film's illumination of the Aztec culture, particularly their awareness of a cosmic-like power flowing through nature and man, triggered a rousing sentiment in me - that if we tune out the noise and tune in to ourselves, our fellow humans, and our Earth, we will find that sustainable human happiness, health, longevity and sustenance not only can be achieved to a degree that boggles the Western mind, but can be achieved quite simply in comparison to traditional western methods. When we open ourselves to the possibility that nature was not created by or for man to serve as a raw materials supplier in our quest to alchemize the Earth - when we mentally and spiritually open ourselves to the reality that we, like all other beings on this planet, are part of a fluid natural system that works - we open ourselves to channel that system's immeasurable power to nourish and heal our bodies, and bring purpose, contentment, joy and love to our spirit.

Suffice to say this film is worth seeing, sharing, and seeing again - for unveiled in it, through the voices of the ancestral descendants of Moctezuma and kin, is a glimpse into the collective wisdom gained by a people during the birth, life, and death of their civilization, whose buildings may have been destroyed, but whose cultural torch has been quietly passed from one generation to the next for nearly half a millennium.",1304553600,3,3773,5.0288
3969004,3,B002QWRSU0,"You can read the reviews here on why this is a good video.  For the aspects of keeping alive authentic Aztec traditions you have to agree completely.  So this has really good information you won't find anywhere else.

However, in the first part of the video there is a scene with brujos (black magicians) that goes on way too long.  They are performing a ritual for dark magic and sacrificing a chicken and there is lots of blood. This is clearly either real or depicted cruelty to animals. There should definately be a content warning about this at the front of the film.  So as it is this video is very inappropriate for children.  Even adults will find that scene very distasteful and like I said it goes on way too long.  It does spoil an otherwise very good video.",1296259200,3,769,4.45
3969005,5,B002QWRSU0,"The film explores the cultural ways of Aztec shamanism and concurrently the coming of age of a young man in search of himself.  The film is fascinating in that it is really three films in one: a literal exploration of Aztec customs through interviews with scholars, researchers and anthropologists; a narrative account of a young man named Taachi as he travels a journey from anger and rebellion to personal and cultural awakening; and a documentary thread with imagery and voiceover explaining different elements of Aztec history.

Taachi begins with rage, frustrated at his position in society and the heirarchy offered by his work and the ruthlessness of his boss.  He goes in search of a curse to put on his boss but quickly learns that the way to personal salvation is not through his rage but through his culture (which he had previously been unfamiliar with) and his love.  A perfect quote onscreen describes his inner journey as he is taken under the wing of a shaman who explains simultaneously to Taachi and to us as viewers the details of the path that Taachi then follows.  ""Only in the quiet of our own darkness is our inner light revealed""

I had no previous direct interest in Aztec history or culture, and regardless, was fascinated by this film.  Its pacing is methodical, consistent, and quite engaging.  The visuals and graphics are revealing and interesting.  The narrative structure is engaging and very informative.  I was entertained and educated all at the same time.

I recommend it highly both to individuals seeking to learn something new, and to classrooms as well: instructors and historians, anthropologists, and sociologists should buy a copy and show it to their students in order to broaden their class offerings and more importantly the global cultural awareness of their students.

Well done!",1292889600,9,1827,4.993399339933993
3969006,5,B002QWRSU0,"I came across this film quite by accident; I was doing some research on shamanism and came across the trailer & the making of documentary on YouTube. I was impressed by it so much that I went to Amazon. UK to buy the DVD but unfortunately it wasn't available here so I had to purchase it from the American site. Although I had to wait an additional week to receive it and it cost me a bit more I must say it was WELL WORTH it! I watched it on the same night that I received it. I was definitely blown away, I've seen it now 3 times and will watch again tonight with friends. As a documentary/film the subject matter of present day Aztec descendants, their beliefs and shamanic practice will intrigue any one that is open minded to alternative interdimensional realities. This is a mind expanding film that incorporates beautiful cinematography, deep dialogue, intelligent commentators, entheogenic vistas, great music, inspired quotes and a subject matter treated with great love and respect. My favourite documentary of the last few years bar none..A BIG well done to the director and production crew.",1288915200,7,1102,4.744791666666667
3969007,5,B002QWRSU0,"Cheyene understands the art of film-making inasmuch as it can be a vehicle for story-telling in the ancient sense.  Vision quests were once the calling cards for the shamanic set, but today, in a world depleted of its natural frontier, the paths to our visionary selves are barren and difficult to identify in the dreaming realm of a post-industrial world.  So it is left to artists like Cheyene, who use filmic devices to dislodge us from our waking lives and teach us about the road that leads us to the collective soul.

This is a film about a forgotten history which has more to do with our present and future than anything on Huffington Post or Politico.  If we are to pass into the next world, we need a crash course in healing and identifying those aspects of our selves, and our communities, which are eternal.  Follow the young apprentice (Tachi) and listen to his guides, and we'll all be one step closer to the kind of destiny that I want for my children.",1277942400,,966,4.528735632183908
3969008,5,B002QWRSU0,"hey there, i'm still watching this film right now and it's already clear to me that this is a step forward to my own spiritual center. it' a step back from a direction that's now obviously wrong, it's a closer look into the mirror.
I don't know who you are, reading this right now, but I knew something was calling me, when I first heard about this film. sometimes things, people, voices are calling us. i give much respect and love to shaahin cheyene for making this film. i haven't read his book yet, but i definitely will.
there are so many lies out there surrounding us. and very often our first reflex after realizing something is wrong is to go and fight whatever it is. but thats not the solution and we know it. we gotta go and look for the better. go fight for something, not against and then take the next step and stop fighting altogether and focus on healing. it's the light that we seek in darkness. its not the other way around. we gotta face ourselves and except ourselves before can start to change.
this movie reminds me of a lot of great things i already learned in and from life, dreams, inspirations, earth, space, darkness... this film tells me more than words. it's like a reminder. it shows a peek into a tradition thats never been lost but hidden, older and also much fresher than everyday western cults, that we as europeans and americans grew up with.
i always knew there was something wrong with our culture and i always knew there was something good and redeeming to find in ancient traditions. i tried lots of things and it all kind of started with reading a book by carlos castaneda. my mind and spirit travelled all around the globe and now it all comes down and back to where i started my spiritual search, back to mexico, back to the ancestors, back to the aztecs, toltecs...
i can already recommend this film to every light-, truth- and selfseeker. a great honest journey made obviously with love and respect.",1269043200,,1943,4.491525423728813
3969009,5,B002QWRSU0,"Serpent and the Sun offers an interesting and unique glimpse into the world of Shamanism. Beautifully shot, with a story that keeps you wondering just what will happen next right up until the final scene. Do not miss this movie!",1268956800,2,228,4.725
3969010,5,B002QWRSU0,"An absorbing documentary feature, Serpent and the Sun depicts a young Latin rebel's spiritual healing after he enters an apprenticeship with a real life Aztec healer. The film's positive emphasis on life creates a motivational outlook on the darkness that sometimes engulfs us in our lives. Taking a natural approach to achieving self enlightenment and healing, Tachi, the young rebel, learns to rediscover his roots and himself with the help of his teacher. Shot entirely in Mexico, the filmmakers created a visually interesting collage of Mexican terrain and culture.

Recommended for anyone who enjoys self-help, spiritual and motivational books and movies.",1266969600,2,660,5.534653465346534
3969011,5,B002QWRSU0,"This movie blew me away!
I have now watched it 3 times and will see it again.
There is so much relevant and mind opening information and wisdom in regards to spirituality and life in this movie.  I have recommended it highly to my friends and family.

The cinematography is very good and the scenery beautiful which also makes Serpent And The Sun a pleasure to watch.",1266537600,2,367,4.462686567164179

3969013,5,B002QWRSU0,I saw this film for the first time about two weeks ago and can honestly say it is one of the best documentary films I have seen in a very long time. It kept me thinking long after the film was over about all the ancient medicine subcultures that still exist today and how beneficial they could be to mainstream society. The journey is beautifully shot and there is never a dull moment .,1265328000,,386,4.22972972972973
3969014,5,B002QWRSU0,"Serpent and the Sun is an sensitive, authentic and beautifully done story of shamanic initiation and transformation. It honors the wisdom and dignity of ancient Meso-American healing ways and their relevance to the social and environmental challenges of today's world. It is definitely a ""must-see"" for anyone interested in healing, shamanism, indigenous spirituality, responsible usage of psychedelic power plants and learning how to live more responsibly with the sacred cycles of life.

8378045,5,B002QWRSU0,"The Serpent and the Sun: Tales of an Aztec Apprentice is such an inspiring story about a culture that has been fetishized and turned into a caricature. It was really refreshing to see an honest story told about a young man's journey to spiritual healing in his cultural roots. The best way to understand a culture and a people group is to hear from its members. This documentary includes information from several experts in the Mayan race and culture, so I appreciate that the information is verifiable. Truly an enjoyable and educational film.",1525651200,,544,4.860215053763441
8378046,5,B002QWRSU0,"I study all paths in search of the commonalities and universal truths. A lot of good tidbits in this one, and it held my  interest.  I am a die hard Edgar Cayce follower, to me he has the highest truths explaining the Bible and more. He says find where regions meet or agree.
  One exception I would mention here is that Cayce explains 2 Biblical quotes.  Cayce explains that ""He who climbs up by another path is a robber and a thief"" refers to the use of various drugs, mushrooms etc is not the proper way to seek enlightenment. Also he explains ""Blessed are the poor in spirit"" refers to people who don't have/use familiar spirits  or use animal spirits are on the correct path.  I don't know if that pertains to plant allies.  I am sorry, excuse me here, I REALLY DISLIKE PREACHING CHRISTIANS !  Most are clueless, lie, worship 1 hour a week etc.
  True Christianity is about having the Holy Spirit or Holy Breath was the original way it was written, becoming Saints, having the kundalini, yogic powers, etc.
  Still there are many truths presented in this film, you must heal yourself first, all is energy and life.  I just wanted to staunch those who may get enthralled by the idea of using mushrooms or peyote to seek enlightenment.  To me many paths contain various truths, and many paths contain errors, especially the everyday Christians full of hate, lacking compassion and basic understanding of what Christ taught.  So forgive my bringing up Christianity that has hurt so many peoples of the world by the IGNORANT Christians in name only.",1522886400,,1550,4.643382352941177
8378047,5,B002QWRSU0,If you want to learn more about Mexico and what it takes to me an Aztec medicine man then watch this. The views of Mexico are breath taking. The story is about a 21 year boy who crosses paths with a medicine man and there the boy learns his roots and what his purpose was in life. An inspiration and a well filmed documentary.,1522627200,,326,4.109375

8378051,5,B002QWRSU0,"What a movie/documentary! Its hard to explain, but it really sucks you in. I wasn't sure I would enjoy this type of film but I did! You just have to see for yourself so you can fully understand the greatness!",1520812800,,208,4.225
8378052,5,B002QWRSU0,"This is not an easy film to characterize. It is, at times, a work of fiction although steeped deeply in the Aztec heritage. At other times, it is more of a documentary of Aztec history and the essential journey of the shaman. Throughout, it is a stunning film with breathtaking cinematography of the Mexican countryside. It is also a deeply moving film for those of us on a spiritual journey.

On the surface, this is the tale of a young mans journey to his authentic self, but peppered with a documentary style narrative explaining Aztec history and culture. The main character is guided by a shaman who helps him and the viewer discover an inner journey toward healing and redemptionnot just personally, but for a forgotten and marginalized people. Ultimately his journey mirrors the journey we all just make if we want to live fully.",1520553600,,836,4.76551724137931
