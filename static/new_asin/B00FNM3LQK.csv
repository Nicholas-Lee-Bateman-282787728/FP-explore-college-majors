6015601,5,B00FNM3LQK,"In July 2012 I discovered this a fabulous Scottish television series called Transatlantic Sessions  that is only came to the US (in NTSC video) last year. It certainly ranks as one of the best music-related DVDs I've watched this year and is a true must-see for folk music fans (both American and Celtic) and anyone who enjoys good music, played by experts in the field.

Though this is the SIXTH volume in the series, its only the FOURTH released on US-compatible NTSC format. (Volumes 1 and 3 are still only available in the UK PAL format, though Im told that 2014 should bring those volumes which ARE available on Audio CDs  three separate CDs to a season.

It took a bit of research to understand why the first DVD release in the US was Season FIVE of the program. I'll try to share the info in order to avoid confusion as you check out this DVD and the series.

In 1995 Scottish fiddle player Aly Bain (best known as a founding member of the seminal Celtic band The Boys of The Lough), had a great idea for a TV series for BBC Scotland. He invited Nashville-based dobro player Jerry Douglas to invite some of his fellow musicians to come to a hunting lodge in the Scottish Highlands for a week and perform with some of the best Scottish and Irish singers and musicians, blending the acoustic sounds of both cultures as the played together and accompanied one another. The series - consisting of six 29-minute episodes was a success and, in 1998, a second season was recorded. It was another nine years until Series 3 and then two more years till Series 4 and, finally, in 2011, Series 5. The shows were released in the UK on DVD by Bain's record company, Whirlie Records, but only in the PAL format, which cannot be played on US TVs. Because they need to go back to the master tapes for NTSC, they decided to release the series in the US in non-chronological order. Series 5 was the first, to be followed by Series 2 and 4 and finally Series 1 and 3. And  right on schedule  Series 6 was released in late 2013. Thats this one.

I reviewed the earlier sets here on Amazon (you can find my reviews there) and Ill refer to this quote from Season 5:

During the five seasons 245 performances captured by 179 different artists! While many are familiar to American audiences, because they are US-based or have toured here, there are wonderful new discoveries from the Scottish performers that Bain brought to the ""party"".

The two-DVD set for Season 6  contains 40 songs (including five never air on TV) by 24 artists in various combinations. Bain and Douglas are on many- but not all - of them. They are part of the 10-piece all-male ""house band"" which also includes guitarist/mandolinist Russ Barenberg, bassist Danny Thompson and fiddle/flute player John McCusker. Among the ""guests"" this time are Americans Mary Chapin Carpente and Tim OBrien. (A much smaller US contingent than prior seasons). From the other side of the ocean come Phil Cunningham, Julie Fowlis, Teddy Thompson, Maura OConnell, Andy Irvine and Aoife ODonovan, amoung others. The women vocalists often provide backing vocals for one another. I felt that there seemed to be more slower songs on this set than the previous ones  especially the vocal numbers. And there are no outtakes, bonus tracks, or featurettes this time either. Just the six programs.

Another change is that they moved from the hotel resort used in past seasons to a cottage on Loch Lomond  and it appears to be Spring as the only snow is on top of the mountains.

The camera work superb and captures the interaction between the musicians who all seem relaxed and - as Krauss states at one point - thrilled to be part of this once-in-a -lifetime experience. Director Mike Alexander separates the performances by shots of the beautiful countryside outside the lodge. And, while these are not Bluray, the images are HD.

While the following performers are not in Series 6, I wanted to give you a taste of those on the earlier series - which are forth coming. There we will get to see: Kathy Mattea, Dick Gaughan, Ricky Skaggs, Michael Doucet, Kate & Anna McGarrigle, Dan Tyminski, Joan Osborne, Rufus & Martha Wainwright, John Martyn, Nancy Griffith, James Taylor and a bunch of Celtic performers who I'm sure will surprise us.

One final word: As I said earlier Whirlie has also released AUDIO-only versions of this show on CD but, honestly, watching the musicians play adds so much to the enjoyment that I'm sure I'll be popping these DVDs in my player on a regular basis,

If I could give these sets six stars (or more!) I would. Theyre  that good!

6015603,4,B00FNM3LQK,"Still good, still worth the money, but not as good as the first four sessions in this series. No longer playing mostly traditional music, they have left this poor old geezer behind to cater to the millenials, boomers, zoomers, whatever they're called this week.",1423872000,4,261,4.954545454545454

The setting is perfect, the passion is unbelievable and the music is exquisite. There's Irish,ballads,country all beautifully done in the acoustic fashion,except for Jerry Douglas using lap steel guitar on some cuts(if you know Jerry Douglas, it doesn't matter what he plays, it's great)! Believe me ,you will enjoy this video many times over! The video and sound quality is excellent.",1419120000,2,544,4.797872340425532

6015608,5,B00FNM3LQK,"I've never run across this series till I saw 3 clips on PBS last week. I HAD to get Series 6! I am so happy I did. I'm rather new to folk and never really was drawn to Celtic music, but these performances have made me see what magic it is. Series 6 is an experience for all the senses.  The musicians are absolutely brilliant, the scenery from the location filmed is beautiful, peaceful.  The recording of the voices and music is perfect. I can't rave enough about it.  This is a must have.  You absolutely will be captivated.",1402790400,7,526,4.282828282828283
6015609,5,B00FNM3LQK,"A DVD with Mary Chapin Carpenter, Maura O'Connell and Aoife Donovan; how could you go wrong. Beautiful songs, harmonies and musicianship. Jerry Douglas works his magic again and once again I was able to watch this in total awe and with goosebumps. Did I mention teddy Thompson and Tim O'Brien. please hurry up and start on Session 7",1390176000,5,332,4.741379310344827
6015610,5,B00FNM3LQK,"I previously bought and loved seasons 4 and 5 of this superb series. Season 6 is, in many ways, my favorite. It was shot in a beautiful house overlooking Loch Lomond, and the new scenery and lighting are striking. The camera work and audio engineering are, once again, first rate.

Aly Bain and Jerry Douglas have put together a superb house-band. Mike McGoldrick on pipes and flutes, Russ Barenberg on guitar, and Phil Cunningham on accordion are three of my favorites, but saying that misses the most essential thing about this band, which is how brilliantly they all play together as a group. Their guest musicians are extremely lucky to be supported by such a generous and accomplished band.

Every season I have seen has introduced me to guest performers that I knew nothing about before, or that I had not been exposed to enough to really appreciate. This season is no exception. My favorite ""discovery"" this time around is probably Maura O'Connell. What a magnificent voice! I don't know how I made it this far without hearing her, but I'm already trying to catch up with her career. Cara Dillon is another belated find. Aoife O'Donovan, Julie Fowlis, Karen Matheson, and Mary Chapin Carpenter are all in excellent voice, and in addition to their solo turns also provide rich harmonies for other performers (including each other).

My only regret for Season 6 is that there are no DVD bonus performances this time around. Season 4 had 4 bonus tracks, and Season 5 had 5. I would have really enjoyed another song or two by Maura O'Connell, at least, but that's a small gripe because what we have been given is so consistently excellent.

Bottom line: Season 6 of the Transatlantic Sessions is a treasure.",1390089600,10,1710,4.786440677966102
6015611,5,B00FNM3LQK,I love this series of recordings and this latest version is no exception.
