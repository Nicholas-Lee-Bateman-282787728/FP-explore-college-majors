I love this.  First got it from my church, later bought it from a christian book supply company.  I bought it several years before I went to Israel.  This video shows many of the sites the christian tours take you to like the Jordan River, the Dead Sea, the Sea of Galilee, the Temple Mount and wailing wall.  I mostly bought it though for the music.  I watched this the other day, warned my mother that I'd be singing along and hoped she wouldn't be bothered.

I love how the whole video has arranged the scenes of Eretz Israel, the songs, the narration etc.  There are also scenes of The Passion Play which is held in Eureka Springs, Arkansas every Easter.  It's a protestant church flick so of course the gospel story is herein.  The funny thing about my trip to Israel is that thereafter I really longed more than anything to become a jew.  I didn't purchase this as a preparation for the trip, but I relive that trip now years later when I watch this.

Anyway,  it's obviously a keeper, I'm not tossing this one out.

'Sh'ma Yis'ra'eil Adonai Eloheinu Adonai, Adonai echad.  Barukh sheim k'vod malkhuto l'olam, l'olam va'ed.

My soul wait thou only, only upon G-d, for from Him is my expectation.  He is my defense, I shall not be moved.  My messiah only, He only is my Rock and the horn of my salvation.'  ""He is My Defense"" is sung by Marty Goetz and is one of my favorite songs sung on this video.  I also love ""Oh Come, O Come, Emmanuel"", my favorite Christmas hymn and ""What Wondrous Love is This"" which is a southern folk hymn.

'When I was sinking down, sinking down, sinking down.  When I was sinking down, beneath G-d's righteous frown, Christ laid aside His crown for my soul, for my soul.  Christ laid aside His crown for my soul.'",1208736000,3,1860,4.451038575667655

I promised, took it home, and later that afternoon sat down for what turned  out to be one of the most surpisingly awesome journies of my life.  This is  not a documentary, but rather a divinely holy experience.  For those who  have had the joy of actually visiting this land, it awakens precious memory  and reveals places missed in travels.  I shared this video with friends who  had gone to Israel and they were as profoundly moved as I was by it.  As  for me who has only just dreamed of such an adventure, this glorious  presentation is now among my most priceless treasures. Anytime I want I can  just sit back, relax, and be transported as if by the wings of angels  through landscapes, into sheep filled valleys, over rivers and seas, around  cities, as if walking right beside the people of that land.  As I delight  in the skillfully presented simple beauity of Israel, my soul is lifted to  heaven by music which sounds like it is being sung by angels.  The better  your sterio system, the more you can drink in all this blessing of a video  has to offer.  And if you have never heard the music of Marty Guetz, get  ready for an extrodinary bonus treat.  All in all this pleasure beyond  measure will be a very special free gift I myself will enjoy over and  again. And I will give it to others who I know will be as blessed as I am  by such a profoundly passionate pilgrimage.",962236800,4,1512,4.284697508896797
