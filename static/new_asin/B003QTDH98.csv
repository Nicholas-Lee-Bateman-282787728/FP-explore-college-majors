It made me feel sympathetic to these women but at times they also made me cringe. In my non professional opinion, it isn't that they love cats too much, but rather they can't control their impulses to ""rescue"" these felines. I also wanted to see if I could become a cat lady. It seems not since my one cat keeps me busy enough. Too many would be overwhelming, as you can see in this documentary. I knocked off a star because I would have liked to get some perspective from licensed psychotherapists.",1396396800,,667,4.430894308943089
