8101984,4,B000CSTKH4,"We open this film with the scene of a young girl being vulgarly violated, and if that's not shocking enough, we immediately find out she was deflowered by her own father. Her mother strolls in, says nothing to dear old dad, but accuses her daughter of being a slut, and they banish her to a nunnery. (Egad, Watson, these villagers are fiends!).

 The film is prefaced with the statement, ""What need has Christ of so many virgins and the human race so many victims?"" (I love it when an exploitative flick gets esoteric). This movie is another example of what's defined as 'Nunsploitation', yet it's too artsy to be truly classified as such, though it more than qualifies as nunsploitation. This is true of most of these films - they're too classy and artsy to be puerile trash, and too trashy to be considered art. That's why the other reviewer's disliked this one.

Unless you're referencing 'The Devils', 'Alucarda', 'Images In A Convent', 'Sister Emmanuelle', 'Killer Nun',  The Nun Of Monza' or 'Sacred Flesh', all of which are straight-up nunsploitation flix, and I own and enjoy every one of them except the 'Monza' remake by that hack Bruno Mattai (forgive me for speaking ill of the departed), these flicks all suffer or are abetted (depending on your outlook) by the director or producer being deluded into thinking that they're making an artistic statement.  Even the fantastically wicked 'Satanico Pandemonium' and the supremely filthy 'Images In A Convent' are art-house porn, for chrissakes. (It's as close to art as Joe D'Amato ever got, that's for certain).

And sometimes they are art - take 'Flavia The Heretic', 'Story Of A Cloistered Nun', 'Love Letter To A Nun' and 'The Nuns Of Saint Archangel' - all of these flicks are transcendent insofar as they are Art house and exploitive at the same time. I like `em that way, but most of my 'naughty nun' brethren just want nudity, group or self-flagellation and lupine lesbo-lunacy... whatever floats your boat. In truth, I live for these elements as well. Most women think ""There's no such thing as being too thin"", and most men believe ""There's no such thing as too much nudity"". I feel ya, brother. But too often these films get trashed just because the film didn't meet the viewer's exploitive expectations. That's where I come in - I like my sleaze peppered with a little art, otherwise you might as well watch porn, right?

That said, does this film qualify as nunsploitation? Hell yeah. Absolutely. There's enough radical religious extremism counter-balanced by contradictory earthly lustful behavior and greedy conspiracy to earn the mantle. There's a bunch of naked Eurobabes in all the right compromising positions, but the portions are doled out and not gluttonous. Is it great nunsploitation? Not really and that's why. The sexual elements are more implied than exposed, too much fondling over the clothes, not quite enough nudity to gratify its audience. Opportunities for envelope-pushing eroticism abound, but are neglected and ignored, but I feel this was a deliberate decision, right or wrong.

After all is said here, I still enjoyed this flick for what it was, rather than what it wasn't. By the way, Joe D'Amato, credited with this film, did not direct it, he was the cinematographer. Now get thee to a nunnery...",1282780800,4,3296,4.926126126126126
8101985,1,B000CSTKH4,"I bought this based on Joe D'Amato making ""Images in a Convent"" which has to be the HOTTEST movie ever made.  ""Convent of Sinners"" completely misses the mark.  It starts off on the wrong foot with a stepfather raping his daughter and that is why she ends up in the convent. (I don't get it either.)  She wants to leave, but they won't let her because she is possessed by the devil. (I don't get it either.)  It tries to appeal to Catholics, but there is too much nudity and implied sex for that, and shows priests lying to save their careers and nuns conspiring.  It tries to appeal to porn addicts, but there is too much history and religious overtones to satisfy us.  The one good scene of a group bath is brought down by a ranting Mother Superior.  I keep thinking I got the wrong movie.  If you're still watching at the end this is about some real person who is not a Saint yet.  (I don't get it either)  I wish I had not got this one.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.  It's such a disappointment after Images in a Convent.",1184371200,7,1039,4.191919191919192
8101986,2,B000CSTKH4,"A proper wic (women in convent) flick should at least contain lots of nudity of course, plenty of nun-to-nun action, flagellation to drive those bad stains on the soul away, and then something extra, maybe a nice inquisition scene, with a nubile nun stretched on the rack while some robed dude sits at a bench with a feather pen taking down her confession. Oh yes, and I haven't met a nun yet that didn't enjoy taking a long soapy bath with another nun, and maybe helping each other out in cleaning those hard to get places.  And since the nuns can hardly walk around in skimpy clothes like in a wip (women in prison) movie, there needs to be a minimum of plot so they can dispose of those bulky penguin costumes as frequently as possible to keep the NTRL factor up (nudity to total running length).

So how does this awful (in any other context) film stack up?  Well, it starts with a bang, an R rated semi-rape with carpet grabbing, and then swings right into a nude convent entry scene of the ""victim"", who's apparently been told, ""get thee to a nunnery"", I guess, I had the sound off.  Can't say much for the underwear, I'd have preferred some thorns, but you can't have everything.

A wasted putting the new girl to bed scene follows, a little self-examination in the hall, and then we're right into a bathing scene, but hey!  It's a dude, that's not right.  Never mind, because for some reason two young topless nuns get their backs striped, and it's not bad, but could have been more graphic.  Then we get a proper bathing scene, although the darn nun hood she's wearing kinda spoils it if you ask me.  Well, let's go to bed, eh?  Only, another lez scene is wasted in the young girl's room, no fair.

A scene of penguin kissing follows - is it just me, or would you prefer nun lez scenes to have less clothes? - but it's wasted when one of the lezzer nuns gets sick, or something.  Darn it, that's three wasted opportunities for action.  We get a self-flagellation scene, but it's kinda short and not graphic enough (at least it's mono topless), and then one of the nuns (with the darn hoods it's hard to tell which one) cops a self-feel while sniffing a stable boy's clothes, but even though he's in the next room, another sex opportunity is let go.

Finally we get a really proper multi-nun bathing scene, fine except for those darn hoods, don't they ever wash their hair?  Must get kind of greasy under there.  Another bedroom lez scene comes up short, a little foaming at the mouth follows (no, I don't know why) and another self-flaggelation scene that's also too short and doesn't show the back, that's breaking the rules in my book.

A decent multi-nun whipping scene follows, but again no back shots, and then . . . nobody expects the Spanish inquisition!  Some church dudes show up and let the torture begin.  They inject her with holy water, somewhere down there, and . . . hey, where's the confession?  There's a brief nude apre-lez scene, also not fair, and then some trial plot, wherein the young nun takes off her clothes, flops on the ground in front of the judges and it ends!  Dang, no marshmallow roast.

They should re-title this film ""Interruptus"", the whole thing is a series of lost opportunites.  All the basic wic ingredients were there, and it failed miserably to take advantage of them.  The best I can come up with is three sleaze stars for nudity, abuse and lezzing, with one redacted in revenge for ending up with blue stones.  In spite of the multiple sleaze scenes, it just never kept you interested long enough. It's also kind of expensive for what you get, not sure I can recommend it at all.",1152662400,39,3632,4.491628614916286
