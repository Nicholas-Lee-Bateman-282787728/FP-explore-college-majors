694860,5,6303632769,"Audrey Hepburn is charming, Michael York narrates, and the filming is stunning.  Features gardens of the world.  Favorite sections are the roses and public gardens.  After watching several times, didn't realize that the DVD flips over to play the opposite side.  You can also play the classical music that is used in the filming.  Highly recommend this DVD.",1017446400,6,357,5.086206896551724
694861,5,6303632769,"I've watched the DVD several times and cannot find a link
to purchase the followup DVD:  Penelope Hobhouse, The Art and
Practice of  Gardening...Has anyone found this DVD? help....",1012608000,,180,5.172413793103448
694862,5,6303632769,"Beautifully conceived and beautifully executed, this is truly and amazing DVD! The two-sided disk contains eight half-hour visits to the world's most  beautiful gardens, plus eighty minutes of great music-only tracks, and two  great behind-the-scenes segments showing Ms Hepburn at her most charming  and personable.
I bought this DVD because I'm a Hepburn fan and her  participation in this project certainly lends the entire undertaking a  touch of class. She introduces each segment, reads poetry (and Anne Frank),  converses with gardeners, and makes observations of her own--usually as she  drifts in or out of the picture wearing elegant Ralph Lauren outfits and  swinging a straw basket or plucking a bloom or two. (Watching the episodes  in quick succession, I realized how true it is that she always favors her  left profile.) In some episodes, however, she is barely on screen at all.  As these shows were taped the year before her death, I suspect her  participation was limited by the state of her health and that she was not  able to fly to every location.
Although the shows would have been much  poorer without Ms Hepburn, they are substantial in their own right. I found  the episode on ""Tulips and Spring Bulbs"" especially informative.  The bulk of the script, it should be noted, fell into the lap of the  narrator, Michael York. He rose to the occasion as best he could, but some  of the text he was expected to read was surely not written to be read aloud  by any human being. (One amusing moment occurred when Mr. York, using his  best Oxonian English, referred to George Washington as ""OUR founding  father."")
The theme that seemed to run through all the episodes is  that gardening is a delicate collaboration between man and nature. As Ms  Hepburn states, quoting gardener Anne Leighton (?), ""A garden, to be a  garden, must represent a different world, however small, from the real  world....Gardening offers man a chance to regulate at least one aspect of  his life--to control his environment and show himself as he wishes to  be.""",966470400,53,2058,4.906976744186046
694863,5,6303632769,"This program offers maximum value. Not only are all the features of the original broadcasts on PBS and the set of tapes present, extras are included as well, including a profile of Audrey Hepburn, a promo for  Penelope Hobhouse, and separate audio tracks for the major music used as  backgrounds in the shows.
The DVD production is impeccable (and cheaper  than VHS to boot). Color is wonderfully pure, and images crisp and  sharp.
But above all, it is the many gorgeous gardens (worldwide) and  Audrey Hepburn's appreciations of them that will hold you entranced. The  scope is broad, and the loving care used in photography, presentation, and  production are always evident. My own favorite is Monet's garden, but there  are wonderful shots of many other spots as well.
This comes highly, and  unreservedly recommended!",949449600,83,821,5.067164179104478
694864,5,6303632769,"However, I recommend to buy it on DVD which has all the 8 installments, at the cost of just one of this tape.  Each installment is about 30 minutes, while the DVD comes with all of them and a lot of extras such as never seen  interviews with Audrey and her crew.  It has over 4 hrs of video and  separate audio tracks.
The commentaries are superb that flows like  poetry.  If your are interested in details what you need is a specialized  book.  The commentaries have enough descriptions to keep the viewer  interest and not overwhelm.  It is a real treasue for your senses.  Even I  recommend to watch it or even listen to it with headphones after a busy day  frequently. If you don't have a DVD player yet, you are missing great  pleasures for your senses like this DVD.  The difference in video and sound  quality is enormous.",940377600,2,829,4.3907284768211925
694865,5,6303632769,"THIS IS MY FIRST TIME TO WRITE A REVIEW OF ANY KIND IN ANY MEDIUM.  I GUESS I NEVER HAD THE TIME OR THE INTEREST TO WRITE ONE.  BESIDES, SO FAR NO ARTIST HAS CREATED IN ME THE SUFFICIENT URGE TO WRITE A REVIEW.  HOWEVER, THERE IS ALWAYS A FIRST TIME AND I FOUND IT IN THIS COMPILATION OF  WORKS PRESENTED BY MS HEPBURN.
THE PRODUCTION OF THESE DOCUMENTARIES IS  EXCELLENT IN EVERY ASPECT OF IT, FROM VIDEO QUALITY AND CONTENT, FUNCTIONAL  WORLD CLASS MUSIC INTERSPERSED PROPERLY WITH THE NARRATIVE, DVD MENU  DESIGN, TO PHOTOGRAPHY.  THE IMAGES OF THE GARDENS AND FLOWERS ARE REALLY  AMAZING.  THE CONTENT OF THE NARRATIVE IS VERY INFORMATIVE, PROPERLY  BALANCED WITH DETAILS BUT WITHOUT BEING TOO BORING, JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP THE  VIEWER INTERESTED, AND AS MRS HEPBURN SAYS ""...HOPEFULLY TO SOW THE  SEEDS OF LOVE FOR THE FLOWERS AND THE THE GARDEN...AND LIFE...""  WHETHER ONE IS AN EXPERT OR NOT, THIS IS FOR EVERYBODY TO ENJOY AND ELEVATE  ONE'S VIEW OF NATURE AND ADD A NEW DIMENSION FOR A BUSY LIFE.
HAVING  CREDITED THE PRODUCTION, IN THE END WHAT RAISES EVEN TO HIGHER LEVELS IS  THE HOST.  MRS HEPBURN IS AS GRACEFUL, ELEGANT, AND CHIC AS EVER BEFORE, OR  MAYBE EVEN MORE, BECAUSE AS SHE AGED, SHE PORTRAYS AN IMAGE OF A PERSONA  WITH HUMILITY AND HUMANITY THAT ONLY EXPERIENCE IN LIFE CAN MAKE IT  BELIEVABLE.  SHE IS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE THAT CAN DELIVER A SPEECH ABOUT  FINE ART, GOOD TASTE, SOPHISTICATION, AND STILL GRAB THE ATTENTION AND STIR  INTEREST IN THE VIEWER SO EFFECTIVELY BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WITHOUTH BEING  PRETENTIOUS.
WHEN ONE LISTENS TO HER IT IS A PLEASURE FOR ALL THE SENSES,  NOT JUST TO THE EAR THROUGH HER UNIQUE VOICE, BECAUSE THE VIEWER IS LEAD TO  PAY ATTENTION TO HER DEMEANOR AND EXPRESSION AS WELL, AS IF SHE HAD A  SPECIAL KIND OF MAGNETISM.  ALTHOUGH SHE COULD HAVE BEEN MY GRAND MOTHER, I  CONSIDERED HER A BEATIFUL WOMAN EVEN IN HER 60'S; THIS SHOWS THAT THE  CONCEPT OF BEAUTY IS NOT BASED JUST ON A PHYSICAL ASPECT BUT RATHER ON THE  WHOLE PERSONA THAT EMANATES FROM WITHIN THE BRAIN AND THE HEART THAT  REFLECTS ALL ASPECTS OF BEAUTY INCLUDING THE ONE THAT IS PERCEIVED BY THE  EYES.
THESE WORKS PAYED A FINAL HOMAGE TO HER BEFORE DEPARTURE FROM THIS  WORLD, WHAT THE FAIREST LADY OF THEM ALL DESERVED.
I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT  I HAVE BECOME A FAN OF A HOLLYWOOD STAR, BUT WAS SHE REALLY A TYPICAL  HOLLYWOOD STAR? FAR FROM IT, SHE WAS A STAR IN HER OWN UNIQUE WAY.
I TOOK  NOTICE OF HER VERY RECENTLY, ALTHOUGH I HAD HEARD OF HER BEFORE, BY  WATCHING ""MY FAIR LADY"".  FROM THAT FILM ON, I BECAME A FAN AND  AM STILL IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING ALL OF HER WORK.
EVEN IF YOU ARE  NOT A FAN OF AUDREY THESE WORKS ARE A FINE PIECE OF ART THAT WILL ENRICH  YOU MORE THAN ANY MOVIE HOLLYWOOD IS PRODUCING TODAY.  AFTER WATCHING THIS  DVD, YOU WILL FEEL MUCH BETTER YOURSELF, FEEL CURIOSITY FOR NATURE AND ITS  BEAUTY, MUSIC, POETRY, TRAVEL, AND IN GENERAL THE NEED TO LEARN MORE SUCH  AS LANGUAGES, AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I FELT.",934761600,22,2967,4.419294990723563

Interestingly, the special advertisement on the The Art & Practice of Gardening by Hobhouse looked much better than the other main video segments. The dvd appears to be a copy from a VHS. Although I don't have full HD, I do have a component tv displaying at 720 and a dvd with upconverting which makes the movies I watch look great. Can only assume the other positive reviews are from people with inferior systems who can't tell the difference or were planted by someone with a financial interest in selling it.

695076,4,6303632769,"Anyone who loves to see peaceful gardens with soothing music in the background will enjoy these.  They were presented on public television as a series around 1993.  Both Audrey Hepburn's portion and Michael York's narration are very soothing and pleasureable.  I was disappointed that Monet's garden and George Washington's garden were repeated in two different programs.  I thought some of the photography could have been better, but overall it was very good. I'm comparing it with the wonderful ""Britain the Garden Kingdom"", a program that I also love and think is superior to ""Gardens of the World"" series.  In my opinion there could have been less dialogue on Miss Hepburn's part and some of the interviews weren't as good as others.

This series features 1) Country Gardens (Cottage) 2) Flowers 3) Roses  4) Formal 5) Public and 6) Tulips.  The viewer is taken to famous places such as Britain and France and a gorgeous bulb garden in the Neitherlands.  There are some spectacular scenes of gardens established 200 to 300 years ago.  I felt there were some gardens that could have been featured that might have been better than some they showed.  Each vhs tape is about 27 minutes.  With the enjoyment I'll gain they were worth the money I paid for them which was about $15.00 plus around $8.00 shipping.  I am the sort of person who will put these on frequently to unwind with a hot cup of tea and my feet up, a great stress reliever.",1287619200,2,1440,4.734939759036145

We have been watching a couple at a time so the whole thing will last longer for us.  We are avid gardeners so this is especially a pleasure.  Just makes you want to get out there and create a garden worthy of those shown, which mostly is impossible even though we have ten acres.

695197,2,6303632769,"While the original TV release of this series in 1993 was beautiful to behold, both in content and picture quality, both the earlier and latest DVD presentations leave much to be desired.  The original 2000 release by Perennial Entertainment was just OK, as far as picture quality goes, and the latest September 2006 release from Kultur is certainly no better.  I would say they are both from the same video tape master.  The series was shot on film, and then transferred to either 1"" video tape or SP Betacam for world-wide TV release, and by the look of the picture quality of both DVD versions, they could have been transferred from a poor quality VHS tape.  When enlarged onto a front projection screen, the picture quality deteriorates badly.  Be warned, the latest edition is no better than the previous version.

I was expecting and hoping for much more information and insight on Audrey Hepburn and the making of 'Gardens of the World' in the 'newly' included documentary ""In Pursuit of Beauty - Audrey Hepburn's Gardens of the World Grand Tour"" which is included on disc 3 in the new release.  This is NOT a documentary in the true sense.  It is a series of very poor quality ""on location"" shots complete with a few outtakes, several bloopers and many clapper boards, and a few scenes from the completed sequences thrown in for good measure.  The interviews with Miss Hepburn are also featured in the earlier version.  The picture and sound quality of this 45 minute ramble is terrible.

All in all, in my opinion, this new version is a waste of money IF you have the 2000 version in your collection.  Such a disappointment because it was truly a remarkable and visually beautiful series with a most elegant and serene Audrey Hepburn.  I'd give it 5 stars for Miss Hepburn's presentation and its content, but only 2 stars for video quality.",1160092800,51,1848,4.719626168224299

I especially loved the rose garden segment and watch it whenever I need to have a calm break from the world.  Hepburn is very passionate about the need for gardens and appreciative of all the beauty found in them.  I recommend this for all nature lovers.,1079481600,6,343,4.590163934426229
695202,5,6303632769,"Yes! Yes! Yes! I just got it, and it is wonderful! It is good and it is worth it coz you see Audrey being herself. And there is a great special feature about her...on location in UK behind the scenes, which is at least 20 min long. You get to see her wonderful and infectious personality and she wins you over all over again. She does an episode about Rose Gardens, and little does she know that she outshines the Rose. She also quotes a line from a poem: ""O Rose! who dares to name thee?""
Well, I say...""O Audrey! who dares to name thee?""
Is that enought to tempt u...?
Lol. Well, I am not a huge gardens fan, but i enjoyed this series alot coz she made it fun and interesting to watch",1068595200,11,686,4.088888888888889

7851993,5,6303632769,"Which is more beautiful and filled with true grace? A rose or Audrey Hepburn? Thankfully, viewers need not make a choice. Near the end of her charmed life, Audrey Hepburn took viewers on a world tour, historical and geographical, of the world's great gardens. The result is splendid. The history of gardens is of special interest. They were important to Ancient Egyptians, to the followers of Christ, and onward to today. The photography is the equivalent of natural technicolor. The music is sublime. The episodes are just long enough for a spell of needed calm in a busy world. Hepburn is so very gracious as she reads poetry inspired by flowers and trees and also readily explains botany. Lots of fascinating ""new"" information for many viewers such as the fact that George Washington was an avid and well-schooled gardener and Mount Vernon is one of the world's great gardens 200 years after he designed it.",1495152000,2,910,4.877419354838709

7851996,5,6303632769,"These are some of the most beautiful gardens in the world, and to have Audrey Hepburn be the guide is perfection. It takes a gardener to know and truly appreciate gardens in all forms - growing vegetables to palatial estates and from different parts of the world.

The bonus features are rich: Music tracks, the filming with Penelope Hobhouse, and Hepburn's personal comments.

This is for those who truly love gardens, and Audrey Hepburn, who was an avid gardener herself, was the perfect guide for these gardens.

I have watched this over the years, so when I lost my previous copy of this dvd,  I knew I had to replace it.",1478995200,2,625,4.603603603603603
