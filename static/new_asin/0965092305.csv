172481,4,0965092305,"I have an extensive yoga video collection, and this one is truly different from the others. The music is haunting and beautiful, the voiceover is nice, and the yoga is challenging yet soothing. The practice is set up differently from most videos, starting with warm ups I haven't seen before. There are a lot of balancing postures included here which may be challenging for beginners, but modifications are shown so that anyone can work up to it. It really left me with a nice feeling of stillness, and I enjoyed it very much.",1001030400,24,526,4.666666666666667
172482,5,0965092305,"I have recently been introduced to the Yoga Challenge routine through both video and audio formats.  Since I have been practicing the Bikram routine for over a year, I was familiar with a majority of the poses.  The Yoga Challenge routine includes all of the Bikram poses (save two) and introduces additional poses: standing splits, inner thigh work, ab strenghtening and twists.  IMHO, it manages to accomplish in one hour more than the Bikram routine does in 90 minutes.  Further, one does not need a sauna in which to perform the poses (ala Bikram), just and warm quiet place.  This is very practical for the home practitioner.
The practice is considered beginner/intermediate, but if you are new to yoga it will be challenging.  It is a complete body workout that one may steadily improve upon over time.  The video has three people peforming the poses, with one person doing modifications for the beginner.  Remember to always practice with attention/awareness and an much easiness as possible.
Any fixed yoga routine is not for everyone, but this particular routine works well for those who are athletic (albeit stiff).  With a knowledgable teacher it can be modified to fit almost anyone.
The convenience of this practice focused into one hour makes it very easy to build a daily practice.  I thank the originator ,Tony Sanchez, from bottom of my heart.  Thanks to Yoga Challenge, I am now a daily practitioner of yoga.

172483,5,0965092305,"I purchased this DVD because I wanted to be able to do Bikram yoga at home.  Some of the poses are different from my class, but I like the poses.  Good stretching and extra ab strengthening poses.  The DVD doesn't hold the poses long enough as my class, so I will press pause.  Worth the price and good workout.",1359763200,3,311,4.220338983050848
172484,5,0965092305,Easy to follow. Really like being able to choose the level of difficulty from the 3 people demonstrating the postures.,1359504000,2,118,4.95
172485,5,0965092305,"I was happy to find this video. I was going to the expensive hot yoga classes, putting up with a multitude of different teachers, some of whom were annoying. This video is perfect for me. The instruction is quiet, flowing, as yoga should be.",1356825600,4,241,4.5
172486,4,0965092305,This is perfect for those of you who don't want the hot yoga but love the postures of Bikram Yoga.,1337904000,3,98,3.95
172487,5,0965092305,"I'm a beginner yoga practitioner, but I'm not an out of shape person, in fact I am a long time practitioner of martial arts, and I gotta tell you, this DVD is amazing. Half way through the challenge and I'm drenched in sweat, and that's a very good thing. It is a workout, yet it's soothing. You can make it harder as you get better at it too by staying in the poses for a longer time, doing deeper stances, or stretching your body more. Interestingly enough, I'm finding yoga to be ""addictive"": you really feel good after it, and find yourself making time to practice it more, and you look forward to the next time you'll be doing it.

This series and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yin-Yoga-The-Foundations-of-a-Quiet-Practice/dp/B000B5871I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yin Yoga: The Foundations of a Quiet Practice</a>&nbsp;are excellent choices and they complement each other. Do not hesitate, buy this program if you were on the fence deciding weather to buy it or not. It's worth it.

Also, if anyone knows the name of the song by David Darling played on this challenge dvd, please let me know. The music is beautiful and goes perfectly with the video.",1336953600,6,1200,5.212435233160622
172488,3,0965092305,"I was trying to save myself the $150/month I'm paying to practice Bikram in my local studio, so I bought this DVD based on the positive reviews. If you're just looking for a ordinary yoga DVD, you may be pleased with this. But if you're looking for a Bikram substitute (and I mean real Bikram, not ""hot yoga""), you may be disappointed -- as I was.

I know Bikram has a stronghold on the Bikram sequence and dialogue, so I understand that some variation was necessary, but I was thrown off by a few things. 1) Triangle was the second or third posture, and my hamstrings weren't ready for it. 2) Not every posture repeats, and some are grouped in a sequence before the whole sequence repeats. 3) As someone else mentioned, there is no Fixed Firm, which is my favorite posture so that's doubly unfortunate. 4) There is the addition of some peculiar pilates-like moves throughout. And I didn't even finish the DVD, so there may be more distinctions to draw.

I was also less than thrilled with the narration. There's virtually no setup for a lot of the postures, so if you've never been to a Bikram class and are not familiar with the postures, be careful not to hurt yourself. I also found the woman to be too mellow. Fine if you want to relax, but she didn't really inspire me to push myself -- or even to stay conscious.

On the plus side, it's only 60 minutes. As a consequence, however, you also don't hold the postures very long.

I hate to rip the video to shreds based on a comparison to Bikram, because it's not marketed to be a substitute. But let's face it, that's why most people buy it, and I wish someone had deterred me. That being said, if you don't care about Bikram, or if you aren't a strict practitioner, you may enjoy it. I, however, will return to paying my $150/month and will likely never watch this DVD again.",1313539200,8,1830,4.405325443786983
172489,5,0965092305,This is a very good yoga practice. You can feel the improvements in flexibility after 3-4 sessions. I try to simulate the hot room enviroment at home by wearing a sauna suit and this works well. I get a good excercise with the dvd and the sauna suit helps increase my body temperature.,1312416000,4,285,4.39622641509434
172490,5,0965092305,"I've tried many different Yoga videos over the years, believing Yoga is good for me and wanting to succeed at doing Yoga. This is only one that appeals to me.  It's quiet, the person giving the directions has good timing as far as the step by step procedure for getting into and out of the poses, as well as giving hints like ""remember to breath"" just as I am starting to hold my breath. The modified versions done by the other 2 are also very helpful.

 I had the book by Bikram, ""Bikram's Beginning Yoga Class"" for a couple of years before purchasing Tony's Yoga Challenge on VHS. I would highly suggest getting both that book and this DVD. (No difference between VHS tape and DVD, I just needed it on DVD now) The book is funny, and gives lots of encouragement with pictures of others doing the poses starting out, and how they look later. Also explains why you are doing the pose, and what the benefits are.  The exercises are NOT in the same order on this DVD, and a few (really hard ones) are not on the DVD. Tony is a student of Bikram Choundrey. (sp?)

This is not exciting to do, and you do need an hour+. Don't let that turn you off from buying this DVD.  It very easy to get addicted to doing something so quiet. By just listening to the directions, and concentrating, the time goes by faster than you would think.  I do admit to sometimes skipping all the laying down between some of floor exercises, but I know I shouldn't!

When I do this at least every other day, (I do weight training the other days) I feel energized, and sleep better.  My chronic aches and pains, like an achilles tendon injury, lower back injury, as well as upper back area that knots up, all disappear.  I can tell if I skip 2 days, I start hurting.

My husband has started doing it also, he has degenerative back pain.  He is also finding relief.

This type of Yoga has the emphasis on the spine functioning at it's best.  If your spine is strong and in alignment, the rest of your body will be healthy too.

It does work your whole body, it is NOT easy, but anyone can do this, just do the poses the best you can.

Try it.  Give it an honest try, do your best, and start feeling better.",1275782400,17,2175,4.253041362530413
172491,5,0965092305,"I've taken Bikram's Yoga for a couple of years and I love it.  I've been searching for a Bikram's Yoga DVD so I can practice at home but have been unable to find one.  This DVD is great!  Although this is NOT a Bikram's Yoga DVD, the instruction/practice is VERY similar to Bikram's.  What I especially like about this DVD is it's almost like being in a Bikram's class (minus the heat); no bright lights, fancy backgrounds, and the people in the DVD look like actual students--they aren't glammed-out with fancy make-up and hair.  It's simple and to the point. This DVD has three different levels.  If you're a beginner, I suggest taking a couple of Bikram's classes or a yoga class that's similar in practice because the instructors will make sure you're practicing proper form, which is essential in getting the maximum benefits to all the exercises (plus it'll help prevent injuries and strain). My advice is start slow and know your limitations. You'll notice improvement in your flexibility and balance after about 4 workouts. I'm glad I found this DVD!",1224806400,48,1058,4.785714285714286
172492,5,0965092305,"This video was recommended to me by the people from Amazon and I'm truly thankful for that. I own several yoga tapes, from the Living Arts series to the power yoga of Brian Kest, B. Baptiste and others. After a year of daily practice I was getting bored with the same routine and stuck with the same sequence of poses. I found this tape to be refreshing and challenging even for my intermediate level. This is hatha yoga pure and simple, with no gimmicks or trendy stuff. Mr. Sanchez performs the poses flawlesly and in the advanced stage while the other two students show a begginers or intermediate level. I heard that this is a typical Bikram yoga sequence which I'm not familiar with, been used to Iyengar style of yoga, so that to me is a challenge in it self. I truly recommend this tape and the entire series to anyone who wants to commit to a serious yoga practice at home.",1029110400,11,881,4.411042944785276
7793775,5,0965092305,"I really like this DVD, however, some of the standing poses are rather challenging.  I am glad we started with Challenge 1 even though we didn't consider ourselves beginners.  There is a lot of room to make improvements with this routine and we will be using it for quite some time before moving up to the next challenge.  I recommend this DVD for those interested in practicing Hatha yoga.",1459382400,,390,4.6231884057971016

7793777,1,0965092305,"So I got the Yoga Challenge I and 84 Asanas Level 1 to see which I would like best and they were exactly the same.  In fact, in the intro to 84 Asanas Level 1, it has the same intro calling the video Yoga Challenge 1.  It is a good video and sequence overall but I feel ripped off.  I would suggest the Yoga Challenge 1 over 84 Asana because it has an actual menu at the beginning with modifications listed and 84 Asana 1 just goes straight into the postures.",1446163200,2,459,4.021978021978022

7793779,5,0965092305,I love the bikram series as it is the yoga series my body does best with- I never leave with any aches or pains or things just no trfeeling quite right. I don't really adhere to doing the random yoga series that any yoga teacher picks out of the air- this one is tried and true and you can feel it! I highly recommend it.,1394496000,,321,3.953846153846154
7793780,5,0965092305,"I like everything about this video.  Instructions are clear,  music and speech is calm and relaxing and Tony Sanchez is inspiring.  Also a good length, the entire workout is about an hour.",1382745600,2,188,4.8125

7793782,5,0965092305,Love this video and use it twice a week! I have done hot yoga in the studio and now I can at home without the price. Great buy!,1374883200,2,127,3.5714285714285716
7793783,5,0965092305,This is a good all around yoga CD based around the postures common in Bikram Yoga. I got this DVD to go beyond the 26 classic Bikram Yoga postures and to have yoga workout when I cannot do Bikram Yoga at my local studio. I will probably be getting the other Yoga Challenge DVDs in the near future.,1370131200,3,297,4.137931034482759
