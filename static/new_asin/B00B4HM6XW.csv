5555053,1,B00B4HM6XW,"Movie don't have any real plot and Kidman who supposedly a singer don't have voice. Everything goes at it supposedly should go in mainsteram movie--smooooothly.

5555054,4,B00B4HM6XW,"I'm usually sceptical about DVD-r recordings (had bought some in the past that were so bad I sent back), but this one is very good. It is widescreen, but no other frills. Mono sound, but good quality video. I'd say it was worth the price.",1364774400,,238,4.311111111111111

5555061,5,B00B4HM6XW,"This is a really good wind surfing movie.  It shows some design concerns and some really good wind surfing shots.  It is about a young man who loves wind surfing and who is the son of a successful business owner who is also a British Lord and a girl who is a musician.  The young man is sort of spoiled; but not as spoiled as he seems, a dad who loves and respects his son and is proud of him and his accomplishments; but with a son who doesn't see it.  The son is aggravatingly persistent in pursuing the singer (Kidman).  This seems to be one of her first roles.  It's a little staid in the dialog delivery.  The story is excellent. The acting is pretty good.  There is no bad language; but a nude scene so it is probably only for tor teens and older.  Some pretty good wind surfing scenes and some pretty well developed characters.  I liked it and bought it after renting it because I want to see it occasionally.  (I've watched it twice in the last month or so.)",1434585600,4,966,4.195652173913044

5555065,3,B00B4HM6XW,"I'll keep this movie on my shelves for the 'archive' value, it being Kidman's ""first adult movie"", but I can't imagine ever being so lost for something better to do that I'll watch it again.  Nicole Kidman has grown to be a superb actor with a good range and some few sparks of her genius show here and there throughout this ""help her boy to become a man"" flick, but so what.",1427500800,,375,4.208333333333333

5555073,1,B00B4HM6XW,"I watched only about 1/3 of it, if that and turned it off. I do not appreciate all the sex scenes - it like they do not know how to make good movies without that or filthy language. I only tried it because I liked Tom Burlinson's acting in ""Man From Snowyriver""  (1 & 2).
I would have liked to see if his acting stood up to that in this movie but couldn't stomach the other.",1403568000,4,374,3.9210526315789473
5555074,4,B00B4HM6XW,"This story line has been done over and over, but anyone who loves the surf will appreciate this movie. I was very impressed with Nicole Kidman's acting. It's like she was born to be an actress. This movie is about a windsurfer who gets shaken up, and the people who love him get him back on track. Unlike other movies of this kind, where sometimes the main character wins the competition, or doesn't but is considered a hero anyway (like Karate Kid), there is no ending to this movie. It's like the director was told at the last minute that the movie time had to be shortened, so they just cut the end off - a real injustice to an otherwise fun movie.",1380585600,3,651,4.300813008130081

8562305,3,B00B4HM6XW,Great movie really fun and just entertaining. Only reason I gave it a 3 star is because it has just such an abrupt ending and leaves a few questions unanswered. Other then that good watch,1488240000,2,187,4.371428571428571
