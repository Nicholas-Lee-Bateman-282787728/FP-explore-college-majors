6578634,4,B00MHS5G16,"I'm a long-time kickboxing enthusiast. I started with a live class in the early 2000's and then moved to collecting workout DVDs when my live class was canceled as my fitness center closed. My favorite instructors include Janis Saffell, Guillermo Gomez, and Keli Roberts. As a plus-size athlete, I would challenge myself with 5-10Ks and sprint distance triathlons, but my real love was kickboxing.

Fast-forward 15 years and I now find myself out of shape and my heaviest ever, following the birth of a baby and two major surgeries. I needed a place to start over, so I turned to walking workouts (Leslie Sansone). While they are excellent workouts, I craved the challenge of kickboxing. I went searching and found Debby Mack. I have been doing the Plus Size Cardio Kick workout for a few weeks now, interspersed with Jillian Michaels' Beginner Shred and lots of outdoor walking. I feel great!

The first time I did the Plus Size Cardio Kick workout I didn't really like it. My biggest turn-off is the hip-shaking/dancing segments. If I wanted a dancing workout, I would have purchased one! I really wish she had opted for a boxer's shuffle (which is what I substitute) or other kickboxing-related move, so minus one star.

Debby's cuing is excellent, but she could stand to give more instruction on how to do moves properly and she also calls the moves incorrectly in two places, so minus half a star for that. I love that she has plus-size workout partners with two different body types (apple and pear). I can relate to them, so I'm giving back the subtracted half star for using real people I can relate to. Yes, they do seem rather grim, and I do wish that they would smile a time or two (say at the beginning and when they conquer a tough move) but I'm sure that I too look less than thrilled for the majority of my workout. I also wish that Debby had introduced the two ladies. She didn't have to stop the video; she could do that during a repetitive sequence.

The production values aren't the best (e.g., reflections of the lights in the windows), but the video gives me a sweaty, muscle-fatiguing workout. I miss some of the more challenging kick-punch combos from my fitter days, but this workout will help me get back to those. I'm giving it four stars for being a good starting point; the video isn't without its flaws, but it's just what I need right now.

EDIT 02/10/16 - I must correct my earlier comment about the ladies in the back not smiling. If you watch very closely, you can catch a couple of fleeting smiles. I also have more fondness for the hip-shaking segments after doing the workout with my 6yo son. He loves the dancing, which made it much more fun for me.",1454371200,14,2686,4.5875
6578635,5,B00MHS5G16,So fun!,1452038400,,7,3.0
6578636,4,B00MHS5G16,"Not just for plus sizes...good for re-entry into exercising and post injury.  I do this with custom insoles (severed tendon), knee brace.
I chose this and the basic DVD by Mack because there is minimum stress on the knee, foot and no severe jumping.  One does move back and forth alternating feet, and pivoting which gives one the aerobic workout needed; can be modified.  Towards the end there are knee squats and bounces which can be modified, depending on your needs.  One can up the momentum as shown, as well.  I thought that the mid-way hip shaking was ridiculous, when previewing, but this is one of my favorite parts, where I can just have some absurd fun. There are enough upward arm movements to help to strengthen the shoulders and upper body.  Mack's instructions are clear and announced in a timely manner.
All in all it is a very good, low impact routine.  The basic DVD by Mack, is even lighter and I do it on alternate days. If just starting or post injury, you will probably break a sweat.  There is another exercise DVD site that shows previews of all exercise videos, which you might seek out, to get a better idea as to whether you want this or not.",1438387200,6,1169,4.507109004739337

6578638,5,B00MHS5G16,This workout is really good. I really like when they use other plus sized people in the DVD's (If they can do it so can I). That being said those other two gals really needed to smile a little and act like the workout was worth while.,1434326400,,234,4.0
6578639,3,B00MHS5G16,"Was disappointed in the ""dance time"" during the workout. Felt like that time could have been better utilized.",1431043200,2,109,5.111111111111111
6578640,5,B00MHS5G16,Love this dvd. Great workout for plus size people. Not hard to do and you really get a workout! I will be looking for more Debby Mack dvd's.,1427673600,,140,4.035714285714286
6578641,2,B00MHS5G16,"Pros: Plus size women working out, very easy to follow, decent music, excellent instruction.

Cons: Its one movement done forever, then another move done forever, and on and on - moves aren't combined and made into a routine. It wasn't at all fun or engaging. Even the background exercisers looked like they wanted to be anywhere but there.

I really wanted to like this video - but its so boring I almost fell asleep on my feet.",1419292800,6,429,4.558441558441558
6578642,5,B00MHS5G16,Nice and very refreshing to find a workout for plus size ladies that still had a fun young feeling.  With beautiful real ladies working it.,1417996800,2,139,4.56
6578643,4,B00MHS5G16,"I was pleasantly surprised with this DVD.  The cardio portion gave me a good workout and was very easy to follow.  I quick liked Debby and her format.  She was easy to follow and always gave ample ""warning"" before she switched steps.  There is minimal pivoting in this, which is good if you work out on a carpeted surface as I do.  I was less impressed with the toning section, but that's okay...I'll just stick with the cardio.",1415923200,5,428,4.435897435897436
6578644,5,B00MHS5G16,"Get up and move! This DVD allows me to feel like part of the class. I still lag behind some, but at least I can participate, unlike the videos with Jane Fonda and other fortunate people to have flexibility. I recommend keeping water nearby to drink between moves, as you will sweat.",1498694400,,282,4.4423076923076925

6578646,5,B00MHS5G16,This workout video is the best. I love that it's not super skinny instructers doing it. It's everyday people like me working out. Great variety of workouts in the video. I bought anoither one since I liked this one.,1487462400,3,215,4.538461538461538
6578647,4,B00MHS5G16,"Good for the true beginner. I struggled with parts of it, but agree with the other reviewer that the hip-shaking seemed a bit pointless.",1485475200,,136,4.708333333333333

6578649,5,B00MHS5G16,"I purchased this and the Back 2 Basics as well. I have a good 100lbs to lose and was looking for something easier I can follow, yet still get a good sweat going. I have some other higher intensity workout DVDs but I was getting so winded early on that it was a struggle to keep going and I would get discouraged. Since I'm just getting back into exercising, I was happy I came across this on Amazon! At first I thought it might be too easy, but when I was a few minutes in I could did feel the sweat and burn!",1470873600,3,509,3.9514563106796117
6578650,5,B00MHS5G16,"The video was received in excellent condition.  The workout is easy to do and I lik the music.  The toning exercise at the end is good.
Just don't do the squats the way the video instructs.  Put your back and shoulders against a wall to keep them straight while you squat.
If they are not straight, you will put a great deal of strain on muscles.",1464652800,,346,4.212121212121212

8672432,5,B00MHS5G16,Very doable workout for an out of shape 50 year old.  Can work up a sweat without wanting to give up in the first five minutes.,1520985600,,127,3.8846153846153846
8672433,2,B00MHS5G16,not crazy about this workout. It's a little fast paced for a beginner. There's a lot of twisting and my knees kept going out. It's not bad if you are in somewhat good shape then I would recommend it.,1515542400,,199,4.128205128205129
8672434,4,B00MHS5G16,"Most people gave this workout a good review, but didn't like the fact that the background exercisers didn't smile.  However, I did not have a problem with this.  It made the workout seem more realistic.  I know I don't smile when I workout.  I love to workout, but I would feel very odd if I smiled during it and it would probably look creepy to others if they saw me doing that.  I also only gave it four stars because nothing is perfect in life.  Anyway, that is my two cents.",1514592000,5,478,4.197802197802198

8672436,5,B00MHS5G16,Not too much and not too little workout. It fits just right for beginners. It's not too long either. The program fits for a good morning quick workout so you can go on about your day feeling energized.,1502064000,,201,4.315789473684211
8672437,5,B00MHS5G16,"This video is very fun. Perfect for Curvy girls who want a good work out but cant do the high kicks. Its a great motivator as well. Debby Mack does a really nice job encouraging women throughout the video. Nice to see curvy girl work outs bc not all of have the Body of Barbie. If we did, we wouldn't need to work out. I love this video, because it promotes excersize for people of all shapes and sized, not just the already thin people. Debby also does a nice job breaking down the steps for those of us with 2 left feet. Great job. I'll Definately recommend this to family and friends.",1500681600,,587,4.20353982300885
