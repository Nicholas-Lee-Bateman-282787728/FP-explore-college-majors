It focuses on Gurdjieff's struggle, despite the socio-political issues of the time, to establish the teaching in Russia, Turkey, and Europe, as well as to find and train helper-instructors to disseminate his teaching.  Of interest, Mr. Patterson once again goes `on location' to visit the cities traveled and the sites where Mr. Gurdjieff met with and taught his pupils.  This installment focuses quite a bit on the relationship between Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, and really gets to the heart of the how and why behind Ouspensky's eventual split away from Gurdjieff, establishing his own separate `school.'  I personally found this latter part most interesting.  The reasons Mr. Patterson presents I think are very plausible and extremely illuminating.  The background in this DVD, as with the first, is filled with a variety of the music that Gurdjieff himself composed, and lend yet another added emotional element and dimension to the video.",1190160000,5,1062,5.291666666666667

A riveting recounting of what Gurdjieff's purpose was! The tale is told in an entertaining fashion while retaining all the factual evidence available.

I was taken to many places and introduced to those who played a part in the gripping story of how a great teacher worked to establish the teaching he brought. The footage both live and archival varies in presentation so that my interest was peaked. The on scene videos from New York to Russia interspersed with period and contemporary photographs give a real sense of the places Gurdjieff lived and worked.

The narrative and music combined to give me a feeling of what Gurdjieff went through. Factual and interpretations of what information is available, and what is missing, are artfully woven through the pictorial journey. The speculation is made clear, and supporting reasoning given so the bare facts are given greater depth and wider meaning.

I highly recommend this video.",1190073600,4,954,5.135483870967742

Gurdjieff; Gurdjieff's Mission begins with Gurdjieff's entry into

most interesting DVD documents Gurdjieff's efforts to establish an
esoteric school in the West. While this portion of Gurdjieff's life is
fairly well documented in literature it has never before been explored
in this medium.  Patterson has used the video medium to give one a
taste of what Work and life would have been like as Gurdjieff
struggled to set up his school first in Russia then Constantinople,
Germany and England before finally succeeding for a period of time in
France.

The difficulties particularly his relationship with PD Ouspensky and
the dangers presented by the Russian Revolution as well as his
successes, such as the first trip to America, are explored in depth
and looked at from a Work point of view.  This DVD would be valuable
for anyone seeking a better understanding of this remarkable Man and
his mission.

For those who have knowledge of and interest in Gurdjieff and his
teaching, the Fourth Way, I would highly recommend the entire trilogy
of DVD's, collectively titled The Life and Significance of George

The teacher-student relationship, relating to Ouspensky, Orage, and Bennett is examined and explained.

It looks at how and why such a brilliant and well-meaning man as Ouspensky could grasp so much of the essential, while being unable to bring it into his being, and what the results of his decision to teach on his own brought him.  This previously unknown information is due to the director's persistent scholarship.  For anyone who has the longing, the sense of wonder, and the good sense to acknowledge the otherworldly contribution of this seminal figure, many questions are answered.

Gurdjieff's Mission, Part II
Introducing The Teaching to the West 1912-1924

Reviewed by Ann Lark,  Half Moon Bay, CA  (5 stars)

G. I. Gurdjieff, the great 20th century Greek-Armenian esoteric teacher, was determined to keep true to his vow to establish the teaching of The Fourth Way in the West.

Convinced that the esoteric knowledge present in the teaching could save humanity, and despite the upheaval and aftermath of the Russian Revolution, Gurdjieff worked with some of the great intellectual and literary minds of the time to find an initiate available to help him  ""step down"" or disseminate the teaching.

Rich in detail, this second video in the trilogy, records Gurdjieff's unique relationships with the brilliant P.D. Ouspensky, J.G. Bennett and A. R. Orage.

This documentary has outstanding value as a teaching tool and offers an introduction to the Gurdjieff/de Hartmann music.

Gurdjieff's 20th  century words sound again  with a new  urgency in our 21st century:  ""Unless the wisdom of the East and the energy of the West can be harnessed and used harmoniously the world will be destroyed.""",1192838400,2,1168,5.176470588235294
2835151,5,B000QBW7L8,"Gurdjieff's Mission:

After watching ""Gurdjieff in Egypt"", I could hardly wait to see the next part of this trilogy - ""Gurdjieff's Mission"".

This video is far more superior in technical quality. The footage is top-notch and the graphic composites are like none I've seen in other documentaries before!

The host, William Patrick Patterson tells the story of Gurdjieff's mission to bring his teaching of the Fourth Way, a way of self-transformation, to western culture. Overcoming incredible difficulties with war, revolution, governmental red tape and financial crises, he finally established his ""Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man"" near Paris.

I am impressed. This documentary doesn't have all the syrupy, concocted drama that is common fare on the History and A&E channels. I get the feeling that this is a true story, told without embellishment, by someone who knows his facts.

2835152,5,B000QBW7L8,"Gurdjieff's Mission begins with the premise from ""Gurdjieff In Egypt"" that ""prehistoric Egypt was Christian many thousands of years before the birth of Christ, that is to say, that its religion was composed of the same principles and ideas that constitute true Christianity."" William Patrick Patterson then raises the challenge brought by Gurdjieff, ""What is the sense and significance of life on earth, and of human life in particular?"" Intriguingly, Patterson expands the themes of his earlier book, ""Struggle of the Magicians"" to explore a parallel question: What was Gurdjieff's mission?

Patterson provides a context, illustrated by extensive historical footage, for the challenges faced and overcome by Gurdjieff. He explores the relationships, and disconnections, with those to whom Gurdjieff looked to step down and transmit these ideas to save humankind: P. D. Ouspensky, John Bennett, and A. R. Orage. Largely ignored until now, there is a mythological quality to these relationships, which will inform any teacher-student commitment.

It portrays the effort made by Gurdjieff to establish the teaching of the Fourth Way in the West. I found it very entertaining and educational at the same time. The principal students of the Work are portrayed along with their individual relationships with Gurdjieff. Well represented are the circumstances under which Gurdjieff and his followers contended in the effort to find a location that allowed for an institute to be established.

This film documents Gurdjieff's struggle to introduce a teaching of consciousness into a world of sleeping humanity. Amidst economic collapse, lawless social upheaval and bloody revolution a small group of seekers meet in Essentuki to receive the principles and practices of the 4th Way. The film effectively communicates what Mr. Gurdjieff and his early students had to endure so that civilization might receive this teaching. We experience the struggle between two forces: 1) Mr. Gurdjieff's active and determined aim to introduce the teaching, and 2) the denying force of unpredictable world events. The struggle between forces is also examined on a personal scale between teacher and student. The immature or inexperienced Gurdjieff reader/student is often confused and divided in their allegiance to Gurdjieff or Ouspensky. Thoroughly researching this question, uncovering the details of the relationship and examining the psychodynamics between Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, the film removes all doubts and clarifies who was the teacher and who the student.

2835156,5,B000QBW7L8,"In the middle of his life, having amassed a significant fortune to support his work, G. I. Gurdjieff appears in Russia with an aim to bring this ancient teaching to the West. His struggle is thwarted by the Russian Revolution, which drives him and his students from St. Petersburg and Moscow to his homeland in Armenia and then West through Turkey to Europe.

Shot in Russia, Constantinople, London, Paris and New York, the video retraces his movements and introduces many of his early pupils, including P. D. Ouspensky, J. G. Bennett and A. R. Orage.

It begins to examine the critical breaks in his relationships with these men. This early period, when the ideas began to be introduced in the West, were marred by Ouspensky's taking on the role of a teacher without permission -- and in competition with Gurdjieff. Many later misunderstandings among students stem from this break, which is here examined in a new light.

The quality of the production is high and the video received a significant award at the Houston International Film Festival. It has recently been issued in DVD format with some revisions and updating. It is an invaluable contribution and will bring much understanding to the enigma that George I. Gurdjieff represents to many present-day students of the Fourth Way and it will appeal to those with just a general interest in the subject.",1190937600,2,1360,4.904347826086957

The narrator, William Patrick Patterson, weaves a dramatic story from the lives of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, while at the same time exploring the relationship between a spiritual teacher and a brilliant but rebellious student. The film also followed the two men to Constantinople, London, Paris and New York after their escape from Russia.
