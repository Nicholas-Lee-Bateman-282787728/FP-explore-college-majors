8125511,5,B000FQISSA,One of my favorite anime.,1423785600,,25,4.2
8125512,5,B000FQISSA,"Abel Nightroad is a Cruznik. A vampire that feeds on the blood of other vampires. He is also a clergyman that fights to protect the humans. A organization is out to start a war between humanity and the nations that are ruled by the vampires. Abel and his friends must fight to protect humanity and the vampires from a war that could wipe out both races. Like it almost did 900 years ago.

This anime is beautifully done. The animation and voice acting are great. The soundtrack is pretty cool too. Like all the great animes this story has tons of great characters and very compelling story. There's nothing bad about it. I am shocked to see that there are people out there that didn't like this series. It's certainly different, but not one you'll soon forget.",1354752000,,760,4.547445255474453
8125513,2,B000FQISSA,"This is one of those animes that you watch once and hope never to see it again.
 Story:  There isn't much of a story to it.  Not exciting, dull, and the ending is completely stupid.
 Characters:  Main character is lame. Why would you make the main character a clumsy fool.  There is not one character that is likable in this story.
 Animation:  The only thing this anime has for it is the graphics.
  I wouldn't recommend it.
  If you want vampire action: see Vampire Hunter D, Hellsing, Blood: the last vampire and the Blood + series (only sub-titled at the moment or cartoon network Midnight on Saturdays)",1183766400,,607,4.570093457943925
8125514,5,B000FQISSA,I highly recomend this anime to other anime fans. It is a great addition to any collectors collection.,1168300800,,102,4.722222222222222
8125515,5,B000FQISSA,"If you're a fan of the hit TV anime ""Trinity Blood"", you'd love this Starter Set. The beautifully designed box is meant to store at least 5-6 DVDs, but it is worth buying by itself as a unique collection. The set includes a booklet describing the main characters in the anime, important information to know to understand the TV series. It also includes 4 tarot cards using characters in the anime.",1168300800,4,397,4.605633802816901
8125516,5,B000FQISSA,"When I first got the first two volumes of ""Trinity Blood,"" I wasn't sure that I will like it but I got hooked as soon as I saw the opening theme. The opening theme is awesome and then when the first episode began, it wasn't boring as most of the anime nowadays. It really got me hooked from the beginning, though I had a difficulty understanding the plot at first.

Father Abel Nightroad is a member of the Vatican's Ax special-operation unit. He transforms into a Kresnik - a vampire that preys on other vampires when push comes to shove and when the situation needs him to transform. On normal days, he is the bespectacled bumbler and when you see him for the first time, he hardly seems the most likely candidate to handle the extreme situations faced by Ax members (much less fend off vampires) but it seems that there is more than meets the eye. He is the main character of the anime and the most loved one, I assume.

Father Nightroad is my favorite character and he does seem indifferent sometimes especially when it comes to women and love. There is a story behind this but it is not clear yet. It is about a woman from his past and someone he loved but they didn't tell her story yet. Maybe we should wait for the upcoming volumes to know the truth.

I always liked paranormal and immortality, so this one grabbed my attention from the start. The opening and ending themes are awesome.

For those of you who are into paranormal, vampires, and immortality, what are you waiting for? Go and get your copy NOW!! It is worth every penny. It is a shame that I didn't get the starter set, though. I will get the starter set for the upcoming volumes.",1164931200,6,1652,4.388888888888889
8125517,5,B000FQISSA,"Trinity Blood Chapter 1 Starter Set is great. These 4 episodes are very intresting and they keep you thinking. Most mysteries surrounding Abel, the Vatican, vampires, and pretty much everything else don't get resolved in this volume, but I really didn't expect them to.

Now for the box, its beautiful. Its not one of those cheap boxes that you just slide the next volumes into whenever you buy them, no this box is shut on all sides and the top opens just enough for you to drop the dvds in and take a look at the beautiful artwork that is on all sides of this box. Overall I think that this is without a doubt worth the money. If your debating on if you want to buy the starter set or just the standard volume 1, my advice, splurge a bit and get the starter set.",1160265600,7,764,4.232876712328767
8125518,5,B000FQISSA,"If you're looking for a show with beautiful design, some blood and violence, and solid action look no further than Trinity Blood. This show is in spirit, a mix of Trigun with Vampires and it succeeds much like Trigun in starting the show off slowly. Not many shows can pull off slow while maintaining the audience attention. Trigun did it well, by slowly introducing us to wonderful characters and brief backstory. The same thing happens here, so do not expect your full on story arc to begin right away. Shows that start with a bang like that seem to fizzle out towards the end. This release features the first 4 episodes, a beautiful art box which promimently sits on the top shelf of my collection and a set of wonderful tarot cards. If you are looking for a solid start to a series or want to give this show chance, take a shot at Trinity Blood. It's something different and familiar at the same time.",1159401600,8,905,4.490909090909091
