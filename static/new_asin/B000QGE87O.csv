8417902,5,B000QGE87O,"This DVD is great for young kids.  My bedbugs are the three characters on the cover (Gooby, Toofy and Woozy) and their big red vacuum caregiver, J. Edgar.  It contains 3 My Bedbugs cartoons: J. Edgar Goes to the Doctor, World of Foods, and Rock Stars.  It also includes bonus features, such as still photographs of the characters and 3 music videos (if you buy the DVD brand new, it also includes a poster of Toofy).  The bedbugs sing fun, catchy songs throughout the episodes and have the same problems that young children face sometimes.  The content is age-appropriate for preschool and elementary children",1315008000,,609,4.8173076923076925
8417903,5,B000QGE87O,"We got  the My Bedbugs Let's Play video after reading an article describing the education research that goes into developing the episodes.  I showed the video to my three year old, one time and then asked her what she learned from the characters.  Her adorable answer warmed my heart and made me feel so good about my purchase!  She said, ""Get a hug, brush your teeth, clean up your mess, get a cuddle.""

I love the fact that routine, personal responsibility and lots of love were all conveyed in one simple and entertaining message and that message hit its mark in one viewing.

I'm off to order more My Bedbugs!",1205884800,,613,4.527272727272727
