7935051,4,B00005A1TG,"This hour-long video is the first part of a two-disc series on the history of Jews in the United States. This part covers the period from 1654, when the first Jews arrived in North America, to 1820, the beginning of the massive wave of Jewish immigration from Germany and Central Europe. (The second part, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taking-Root/dp/B00005A1TH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taking Root</a>,"" covers the period from 1820 to 1880.) Both parts are informative and interesting.

One complaint: Like another reviewer, I found it strange that the film refers to North America prior to European colonization as ""empty"" and ""unexplored."" Also, one commentator in the film says that ""there was very little anti-slavery sentiment in the colonies,"" but I imagine there was plenty of anti-slavery sentiment among the slaves, who constituted something like fifteen percent of the population by the time of the Revolution.

Chapter titles:
- 23 Brazilian Jews land on Manhattan

- Rhode Island welcomes Jewish settlers
