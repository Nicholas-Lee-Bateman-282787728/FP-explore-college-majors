5072171,2,B007AIVQIA,Did not go into detail about what he ate and over all he didn't seem to get that much better.,1364515200,3,93,3.7
5072172,1,B007AIVQIA,"When I saw the film the first time I was so inspired. I had just gotten into eating vegan for health reasons and this really got me interested in raw food. And when Frank came out after the film, with this major physical transformation, I was just blown away.

A couple months later I read his blog, in which he wrote how he never ate raw after the movie, gained back all the weight and tried to kill himself. He ended up losing the weight a couple years later, after joining a gym and avoiding carbs for a year.

I did confront the film makers and was told 'well, we never actually say that his transformation is through raw eating. But you can lose that kind of weight with raw food.'

By showing him skinny after the film, it's implied that his transformation is through raw food. That's what everyone assumes and they're not doing anything to change that perception. Cafe Gratitude is supposedly about living an authentic life, yet, this is not authentic to me. Can the film stand on it's own without showing think Frank after? That's what the real question is. The film has such a big impact, because of the obvious physical transformation and the false assumption that comes along with it and to me it's 'selling out' , if you're willing to perpetrate a 'fraud' in order to get more attention for your film",1363824000,111,1312,4.481171548117155
5072173,3,B007AIVQIA,"This film was emotional and sad and wanted a little more happy/inspirational at the end.  I wish it had been longer and a little more info on the relapse and the apparent happy ending.  I also wish it wasn't so vulgar and the language wasn't so bad but understand that it's real life language for Frank Ferrante.....but man does he need to ""cleanse"" that mouth.  ;)  Those three young men are angels!!",1363737600,,401,4.527777777777778
5072174,4,B007AIVQIA,"Given that it's made by filmmakers who had no previous experience making documentaries, this film is very well done.  It follows Frank Ferrante for 42 days as he attempts, with the help of the young filmmakers, to transform his mind, his body and his life.  Although I don't subscribe to the same spiritual philosophies as the filmmakers, I did find the changes Mr. Ferrante made inspiring, as was the support he received along the way from the filmmakers.  I would have liked the film to pay a little more attention to the actual nutrition aspect, but as the filmmakers note in the post interview, they basically just followed the story where it led.  A worthwhile watch to be sure.",1362873600,,683,4.714285714285714
5072175,4,B007AIVQIA,"I found out about this movie via the folks who made ""Hungry for Change"", and was looking forward to watching Frank's growth and transformation.  However, there is only so much that can happen to someone over 42 days, and the movie admits this near the end.  Frank's larger than life persona and courage to admit the loneliness and emptiness that his life has become as a result of his addictions and, I believe, the rage and shame that comes from sharing this.  His willingless to bare his body and soul is somewhere between courageous and the act of a desparate man.  It was serendipity that he wandered into Cafe Gratitude and met the young men who agreed to help him.  In the end, I don't know if it was the colonics and raw foods as much as it was their love and attention that he craved.  Frank manages to set some boundaries in his life for the first time in a long time.  This makes the viewer hopeful; until he reconnects with family members and you see the rage that he still needs to deal with.  How that happens is left as a mystery, and I wish the film had the time to explore that- or to come up with more of an 'afterward' that explains it better.  The good news is that Frank does appear to be doing well, following a relapse that the film mentions in passing.  I wish Frank could have explained for us all how and why it happened, and how he got back on track...",1360540800,8,1378,4.265384615384615
5072176,5,B007AIVQIA,"We saw this at our local raw food cafe, it is very inspiration. Frank was the perfect guy for the project, he's intelligent, funny and just regular human being .... thank you for baring your soul.",1359849600,,196,4.472222222222222
5072177,3,B007AIVQIA,"It's a decent film with a neat premise.  For me, it was much too obvious how low-budget and amateurish the production was.  It seems like a bunch of 20-somethings with little experience or cash took on this project and did their best.  I definitely prefer ""Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead,"" but this is a fair addition to the collection.",1349222400,2,332,4.593220338983051
5072178,4,B007AIVQIA,"Frankly I enjoyed watching the movie... Frank is really a piece of art. He is so genuine that he is really the star, even though I think the movie was made to show out Cafe Gratitude Philosophy and so. The end should be better, I really didn't like the legends telling about what have happened to Frank after the 42 days, there must have been much more care in the end.",1347408000,7,369,4.211267605633803
5072179,5,B007AIVQIA,"I decided to purchase this because I couldn't seem to find it on Netflix or Blockbuster and it wasn't being shown anywhere near me.  It was a little hard to bite the bullet and pay for it, but I'm glad I did.  Not only because I enjoyed it and found it inspiring, but because my husband ended up watching it several times and has since then begun to work with a trainer and is changing his eating and drinking habits (he's quite overweight, and nothing I could say to him has helped him change).  The most powerful thing about this film is that the transformation of Frank is not just a physical one - and in fact the physical transformation is the least important and the most unexpected.
Read the other reviews to find out what its about.  All I can say is, if you find this subject of transformation interesting, buy this film. You won't regret it.",1338681600,61,851,4.367088607594937

5072182,5,B007AIVQIA,"This is a great movie. It seems like the makers of this documentary held nothing back. The reviewer who said that Frank gained his weight back, according to his blog, is a false statement. I have read every line of Frank's blog and found no such reference. This is a story of determination, redemption, health and love. I highly recommend it!",1465430400,2,342,4.622950819672131
5072183,5,B007AIVQIA,"I Liked the movie cause it showed the true healing journey necessary to get back to your healthy self. It is a realization that your life has to change. Change on an eating level, hydration level, mind level, and spiritual level. All of these levels interconnect as you realize things about yourself. You must come to terms with whatever is limiting you. It is like peeling an onion, we can't dive into the center first. We must first address these levels like layers of an onion. Yeah, sounds deep but it's true. I've gone thru a similar healing journey myself. So I can totally relate to Frank's journey.",1462406400,3,606,4.62037037037037

5072190,5,B007AIVQIA,"I stumbled across this documentary and just fell in love with the whole experience (watch and you'll understand) Since I have a lot in common with Frank I thought maybe it was just me- not so, as I have shown this to friends who also shed a tear when he gets the girl.
This is just good stuff in an often misguided world-
God Bless all involved with this project-  Thank You!",1453420800,,375,4.208333333333333
5072191,5,B007AIVQIA,Really enjoyed seeing the transformation. A great story for the health-conscious and anyone wanting to be more aware of how processed junk foods and sedentary lifestyle wreak havoc on our bodies!,1452988800,,195,5.32258064516129
5072192,5,B007AIVQIA,Great Movie!!,1452643200,,13,6.0
5072193,5,B007AIVQIA,"This documentary was inspirational to me because I'm undergoing my own transformation right now  -- about to embark on 90 days of Phase 1 Rainbow Green Cuisine, which is even more restrictive than the Cafe Gratitude diet.  I will likely watch it several times over the next three months and purchase a copy  of The Expanding River Workbook.  The film really drove home how important the emotional transformation is in order to achieve lasting physical transformation.  It also makes me miss the two Cafe Gratitude restaurants in San Francisco and sad that their experiment in Sacred Commerce led to them needing to close the SF restaurants and sell others off.  The first one in the Mission District had such an incredible vibe to it that you could not help but grin from ear to ear the minute you walked in the door.  Thank you Frank for being so open and vulnerable on your journey!!!",1451606400,,886,4.714285714285714
5072194,5,B007AIVQIA,"By turns funny, heart wrenching and very empathetic, if not down right familiar.

5072202,3,B007AIVQIA,It's basically a home video movie of his journey towards health.  Not a lot of new information and more personal drama than I was interested in.  It was just ok.  There are more informative videos available if you're looking to change your lifestyle... Hungry for Change would be a good one to start with.,1436400000,,305,4.611111111111111
5072203,5,B007AIVQIA,"Wonderful film, great story, you really root for Frank. Warning if you don't like swearing, he does a LOT of it. To me, it was worth it to see the story. I even use the daily affirmation that the boys gave to Frank to repeat every day :)",1434326400,,237,3.9583333333333335

5072212,5,B007AIVQIA,"Great Movie! Really inspiring and real. I had the fortune to see a world premiere in Ithaca with Frank and some of the cast and crew. Highly recommended. (I disagree with some moments of the raw food diet explanation, and it might have been wiser to bring in a psychotherapist early in the process too.)  Cleansings are also debatable. Overall, an amazing and inspiring glimpse into a person's journey with the help of love and care.",1426723200,,433,4.697368421052632

5072214,5,B007AIVQIA,"A tad bit rough on the language but he's at least honest. Was wonderful to see the average American go from 100% S.A.D. (Standard American Diet) to TOTALLY Healthy. I got the book he used and it wasn't that great... a little to new age-ish for me. I'm using the Vitamineral Green and LOVE IT. The Cafe Graditude cookbook is good too. For the most part I think of all my new Healthy Eating movies I've gotten, this one had the most impact on me. I'm making lifestyle changes that are sticking because of this movie.",1424908800,,514,4.364583333333333
5072215,5,B007AIVQIA,"A compelling documentary about a man who begins taking necessary steps to take control of his weight, his health and his life.

5072223,3,B007AIVQIA,"Interesting character whose life is followed for a few months as he is coached towards a healthier life style.  There were some gaps in the story , which were probably due to the guy wanting the cameras out of his face for a while.  There was a tragedy, ( no spoiler here) for which there was no explanation.

5072227,4,B007AIVQIA,"For anyone struggling with weight issues, health issues, and addiction ""May I Be Frank"" is a very honest look into one man's struggle to beat addition and restore health with the help of supportive people that were in the right place at the right time. Regaining health and beating addition is not a smooth road and Frank shows us that even with setbacks, we can still move forward towards healing. Frank learns to love himself, lose weight, beat his addictions and now is an evangelist to others who were once in the place he was.
As a holistic health practitioner, this movie showed me that beating addictions and changing lifestyles is not about will-power but so much more. It really gave me more empathy for people with addictions.
Viewer beware: There are some graphic parts in this movie!",1409616000,,795,4.768115942028985
5072228,3,B007AIVQIA,"I liked the documentary and accept it for what it is.  But as is often the case, the naivete of thinking that the most important challenges of life can be resolved by what one easts is rarely the case.

Each era has it's own niche and the 2010s are definitely about Raw Food living, which is also the only reason this video is relevant.

While there's really nothing new here in that raw , living, chemical free, minimally processed, plant-based foods are ideal for human health, many of Frank's struggles are common.  Frank is really rough around the edges, but like-able and even attractive (check footage of him once he continued his journey on his own terms).  There's really nothing ground breaking here.  But it's his story and how he began a journey that was sort of thrust upon him.  Hope Frankie is a healthier man these days for it.",1408060800,,842,4.573333333333333
5072229,2,B007AIVQIA,"I love a good transformation story, but it was a bit heavy on ideas like ""detoxing,"" eating raw/vegan food (in general, but does NOT go into details), colonics (MAJOR emphasis on the colonics) and other questionable practices done in the name of health.  Agree with the other reviewer about the slight cultish vibe that the young guys gave off, but the movie could be really great for folks who are interested in or agree with this line of thinking.  If you don't, you may need several eyeroll breaks during the film.  Anyway, I'm happy for Frank, but not sure if the movie effectively told the story of his ultimate turnaround, as evidenced by the postscript at the end of the film.",1407542400,,683,4.628099173553719

The physical transformation does play a part in it, but it really doesn't mean much if you don't tackle the underlying cause of the malady. Anything other than dealing with the root cause of the problem is just window dressing.
Frank tackled his demons head-on.

He never had the life-changing benefit of meeting three loving, enthusiastic adults who stuck by his side to help him through his metamorphosis.  My dad died in his sleep on his couch, at the same age that Frank was just beginning to live.  This fact alone made the film so bittersweet for me.  Frank, you changed your life from the inside-out without changing a drop of your delightful personality.  I cannot stop telling people about this film, and I don't want to spoil any of the 'Aha!' moments for anyone by telling them why I loved this film so much.

5072279,4,B007AIVQIA,"This is an inspiring story of transformation, no doubt, but I did not enjoy it as much as ""Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead"". I have watched FSND more than once, and would enjoy watching it yet again.  I am glad I watched ""May I be Frank"", but once will be enough for me.  I found the liberal use of the ""F"" word to be tiresome (no, I am not a prude, nor am I morally offended, I just get tired of hearing it repeatedly).  Additionally, the emphasis on affirmations was pretty cringe inducing for me, and the colonic scenes and bowel movement details were a bit nauseating for me. But, hey, that was all part of the program that helped turn Frank's life around, so I understand why it was included. I would say it is worth watching for anyone who is looking to change his or her life/health/relationships, and looking for inspiration to make a change, but if you are very sensitive, or looking for something you can view in a family setting, try Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead - just as inspiring, and you can watch that with anyone. Plus, there is a website set up with a free forum that guides and supports you in how to actually make changes yourself. Interestingly, I have viewed several recent (past 6 months or so) YouTube videos of Frank Ferrante speaking about the changes in his life.

One reviewer stated that Frank did not lose the weight on a raw food diet because after filming he relapsed on drugs and gained the weight back. This is true, but this experience gave Frank the tools to get back on the horse and try again. He lost the weight by being 60-70 percent raw, limiting carbohydrates, and eating some chicken and fish. He also joined a gym and started working out. The film was shot in 2006. I love raw food and eat plenty of it but I'm not a vegan. For some reason there does not seem to be numbers on former vegans or vegetarians. People go back to animal products for the satiety of fat.

I've watched ""hungry for change"" and saw Frank, therefore my interest to see ""may I be Frank"". Obviously the coaches planted many seeds during this 42 day period, even though Frank ended up collapsing after the movie, those seeds had ""germinated"" in him, thus he soon found his way back to life in a healthy way. As far as I know, Frank is thriving, and I am sure it's all because of his experience during this documentary. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Great job everyone.
