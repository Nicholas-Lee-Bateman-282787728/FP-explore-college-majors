8067646,5,B0009VPFMS,"This movie is funny. It takes place at a university and it is a collection of funny short skits, mostly slapstick comedy. It is in Tagalog though and there are no english subtitles. So it is more a product for the Filipino community and not a typical foreign film with subtitles.",1130716800,,279,4.490196078431373
