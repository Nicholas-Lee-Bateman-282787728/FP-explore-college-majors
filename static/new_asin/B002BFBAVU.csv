3893731,4,B002BFBAVU,"""American Son,"" a nominee for the 2008 Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Award, spotlights 19-year-old Marine Mike Holland (Nick Cannon) who, after completing basic training at Camp Pendleton, spends a four-day Thanksgiving leave with his family and friends in Bakersfield, California.  Mike can't bring himself to tell them what comes next for him:  deployment to Iraq for his first tour of duty.  As Mike attempts to reconnect with his Mom (April Grace), stepfather (Tom Sizemore), and sister (Erica Gluck), and say goodbye to his troubled best friend, Jake (Matt O'Leary), before shipping out, he becomes distracted by the uncertain future he faces.  Instead of spending time with his disintegrating family or the lifelong friend he will leave behind, all he can think about is seeing Cristina (Melonie Diaz), a young woman he casually flirted with on the bus into town.
 ""American Son"" shows the conflict young people face as they undertake a mission they know will present daily life-or-death situations.  It's about taking stock of what is really important and acting on it, rather than sticking with an unfulfilling status quo.  Cannon is very good as Mike and we sympathize with him having to make decisions without enough time to think them through completely.  We know what Mike will be facing overseas. Though there are no tanks, mortars, and roadside bombs, the war is already taking its toll.  Bonus features include a behind-the-scenes featurette, audio commentary with director Neil Abramson, and deleted scenes.",1251244800,4,1527,5.251028806584362
3893732,4,B002BFBAVU,"In 2008, the film ""AMERICAN SON"", directed by Neil Abramson (""Defining Maggie"", ""Without Air"") and screenwriter Eric Schmid submitted their film to the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for the ""Grand Jury Prize"".  The film eventually was picked up by MIRAMAX films and now makes its DVD debut.

The film stars Nick Cannon (husband of Mariah Carey and appeared on the show ""All That"", ""Men in Black II"" and ""Drumline"") as Mike Holland, a 19-year-old who wanted to do something with his life but with no money to pay for college, elected to join the US Marines.  After completing boot camp, the young soldier is told that his squadron will be sent to Iraq and have a 4-day vacation (96 hours) before leaving.

So, Mike decides to use his 96 hours and go back home to Bakersfield, California.  While on the bus, Mike meets Cristina (Melonie Diaz, ""Nip/Tuck"", ""Be Kind Rewind"", ""Feel the Noise""), a college student who is also returning to Bakersfield to meet with her family.  Immediately spending time at the bus, Mike becomes smitten with her and manages to get her phone number.

When Mike arrives home, he is greeted by his good friend Jake (Matt O'Leary, ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"", ""Live Free or Die Hard"" and the ""Spy Kids"" films) who is happy to be reunited with his buddies and plan for a night out with friends in celebration of Mike's return home.

Mike meets with his own family members which include his mother Donna (April Grace, ""The Nine"", ""I Am Legend"" and ""Ghost Whisperer""), his step father Dale (Tom Sizemore, ""Crash"", ""Black Hawk Down"", ""Pearl Harbor""), his little sister Tricia (Erica Gluck) and also his real father Eddie (Chi McBride, ""The Nine"", ""Boston Public"" and ""Pushing Daisies"") and all the while he spends family time, he does not mention to them that he's being sent to Iraq.  All they know is that he's home for a few days.

While Mike spends time with family and friends, he also finds time to spend with Cristina.  The both hit it off so well that he is introduced to her family (which her father is not so supportive of because he wants her to finish up college and not be hooked on a guy) and eventually enjoys his time with her.

But Cristina makes a request to Mike and that is to visit a family friend named Junior (Jay Hernandez, ""Six Degrees"", ""Friday Night Lights"" and ""Lakeview Terrace"") who was a Marine but as injured in Iraq and lost his leg.

Cristina hopes that Mike can help with Junior's depression but after Junior finds out that Mike has the same type of job, same type of squadron, he insists that Mike will definitely go to Iraq.  But Mike lies to Cristina that he isn't going to Iraq.

The film ""AMERICAN SON"" is about the fears of a young soldier, like many young soldiers who join the military in order to find themselves or to get a paying job but soon discover that going to Iraq, you worry if you will ever come back alive.  For Mike, he knows that the US Marines have given him a job but now returning home, meeting a wonderful young woman and to see how much his family and friends care for him, he knows that if he never comes back from Iraq, he needs to make things right.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""AMERICAN SON"" is presented in Widescreen 1:85:1 (Enhanced for 169 Televisions).  For the most part, ""AMERICAN SON"" features cinematography by Kris Kachikis which didn't always involve an elaborate setup, just handling of the camera on a bus, in a home or section in Bakersfield and really, no sets or anything in a Hollywood big budget type of sense.  But for the most part, the film is well captured on film and really good stylistic choices in capturing that lifestyle and area of where Mike once lived.  Granted, filming in a certain area of Bakersfield is not the focal point but it's about covering that genuine emotion on the faces of Mike, his family and friends.  You do get a breathtaking scene with Mike and Cristina at Pismo Beach, which was cool to see.  Overall, picture quality and cinematography for this film on DVD is good as with the editing.

As for the audio, the film is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  ""AMERICAN SON"" is primarily a dialogue-driven film.  So, a viewer can expect the sounds coming from the front and center channels while there are some use of surround sounds with Jake's revving of the engines of his vehicle to a stage where Mike and Jake go to the junkyard and shoot at targets.  But other than that, aside from the hip hop soundtrack, the film is a dialogue-driven film and for the most part, dialogue is understandable and clear.

Subtitles for the film are in Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""AMERICAN SON"" includes the following special features:

  * Audio Commentary by Director Neil Abramson and Producers Daniell Renfrew and Michael Roiff - Commentary for the film is pretty good.  Especially if you are a film student as the three are really good at setting up the scenes and how they were able to accomplish certain shots.  Also, intriguing is during a fight scene, in real life, Nick Cannon accidentally elbows Percy Daggs III (who plays his friend Shawn) and Percy was bleeding a lot and how Nick who felt so badly, bought him a get well present.
  * Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary - Two deleted scenes with commentary are included such as ""Beach Talk-Extended"" (2:08) and ""Be Safe"" (1:07).
  * On Leave in Bakersfield: Behind the Scenes of American Son - (11:37) This featurette details the 20 days of filming and shows us clips from various ""making-of"" segments of the film from arriving to Bakersfield to shoot, seeing the talent act to the final day shooting.  Also, interviews with some of the talent of the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""AMERICAN SON"" is an emotional, gripping and intriguing story about a young soldier who signed up for the military, not to fight a war but to get away from bad influences (since his brother who had a promising life got caught up with narcotics and became hardcore drug addict) and make some money.  But during the 96 hours before he leaves to Iraq, chooses not to worry anyone and realizes for himself that he has a lot to live for and people who care for him but knowing that going to Iraq, he may never come back.

This a story that many soldiers face and the film could have been political but it never goes that direction.  The film pretty much focuses on a guy who tries to hold everything in and not worry his family and friends about him going to Iraq but of course, the pain he feels knowing that in 96 hours, he has found a young woman he cares about but knows that his happiness is only temporary.

It's a film that is very natural.  Especially during a scene when Mike has to meet a marine who didn't fare so well in Iraq and despite the discipline he learned in the Marines, there is still fear of the unknown.

For the most part, the film was well-directed and Nick Cannon and Melonie Diaz definitely had working chemistry and again, everything felt natural and makes the viewer feel that you know someone like Nick, Cristina and the various characters of the film.  And I wouldn't doubt that many viewers probably know someone who is in the military and has fought in Iraq or have heard of the many stories of families in anguish when they hear of a love one who died in the Middle East or those fortunate to come back to their families and have survived the ordeal.

""AMERICAN SON"" is an entertaining film that doesn't need to involve politics or the negative aspect of war or even the promoting why we are at war.  It is simply a true to human nature type of film that captures genuine emotion of a young soldier, the people who care for him and doesn't give off the feeling that this is some Hollywood military film.  It's a film that doesn't need exotic shooting locations nor does need a ton of action, it's a film based on emotion and fortunately, the talent in the film pulled off their emotional scenes quite well.

I did enjoy the film and the DVD features a good amount of features to keep fans of the films glued to the TV set for another hour after watching the film.  Granted, ""AMERICAN SON"" is one of those films that I can't foresee myself watching again and again but I did enjoy it.

Overall, ""AMERICAN SON"" definitely is deserving of a recommendation!",1251244800,5,8267,4.556833558863329
3893733,5,B002BFBAVU,"I first saw this film at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with an enthusiastic crowd, and I highly recommend it.

Nick Cannon gives an honest, top-notch performance as a young soldier during his final four days before shipping out to the Middle East. The acting is excellent, the dialogue is real, the relationships are believable and the direction is tight.",1251158400,2,355,4.916666666666667
3893734,5,B002BFBAVU,"This movie was one of the most talked about at the Sundance 2008 Film Festival.  It's a funny, heart wrenching, realistic depiction of a Marine during his last 72 hour liberty and dealing with the impending reality of actually shipping off to war for the first time.  Nick Cannon's performance and his chemistry with sweetheart Melonie Diaz is hot.  In time, this movie will sit alongside the classic films depicting our men and women in military service.",1251158400,3,455,4.883116883116883
3893735,4,B002BFBAVU,"I saw this film at the 2008 LA Film Festival. I thought it was a great depiction of a soldier going off to Iraq. It was very moving to see how he interacts with his family, friends, and new acquaintances. I was disappointed that this film never made it into theaters, because I thought it would have definately been a successful and popular film. I highly recommend it.",1251072000,4,369,4.4411764705882355
8361194,5,B002BFBAVU,Thanks!,1427932800,,7,7.0
8361195,5,B002BFBAVU,I gave it 5 stars because it was a very good movie to watch the first time and I wanted to watch it again.,1400371200,,106,3.4583333333333335
8361196,5,B002BFBAVU,Great movie I really loved it and Nick Cannon did a great job in this movie. I must admit this was one of Nick's best roles,1380585600,,123,3.769230769230769
8361197,4,B002BFBAVU,"I have to be honest, I have never been a big fan of Nick Cannon as a actor, not having much to go on except maybe ""Drum line"" and that silly America's got Talent. I picked this up as one of those dvd's in the $5.00 bin at your local Walmart. You know the kind.. 10 movies on 3 discs, half you never heard of and maybe 2 movies you have. I have to give Nick props for his portrayal of a soldier heading to Iraq. This movie shows his depth as an actor. I wanted to hate this movie but I couldn't. I was mesmerized by his quiet, cheerful demeanor that over time engrosses you and you actually ""like"" the guy. It's a moving story that sometimes seems jumpy and disjointed but overall it settles down and makes it's case. If you get a chance, see it. If you think you knew Nick Cannon, this movie will change your mind.",1376956800,2,814,4.062111801242236
8361198,4,B002BFBAVU,"I know, I know! Nick Cannon, right? It must be bad. But in all honesty, this is like one of those movies you would watch one early morning and end up being amazed by how wrong you were about it. Of course it's not going to be on a ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Hurt Locker"" rank, but it is definitely one of the best indies I've seen.

So Nick Cannon plays Mike, a confused, lost soul from Bakersfield, CA -- he returns home after his training with some disturbing news about his future, but he chooses not to sully his (last) remaining moments with his family and friends. He discovers the beautiful Cristina (Melonie Diaz) who falls for Mike's wit and fearlessness. Mike also catches up with some of his friends, including his no-good friend Jake (Matt O'Leary) who still manages to flare Mike's temper.

Ultimately, this story is about choices. We all have them. Why do we make stupid decisions? Why do we fall in love? Why, why, why? This movie is not a snore-fest, guys. Seriously, let's see you try to make one better.",1318550400,,1020,4.478494623655914
8361199,1,B002BFBAVU,"This is the slowest, most predictable movie ever. Though it has a couple of redeeming features, the acting is okay, and the cinematography was okay, the incredibly dull story line that pretty much goes no where interesting unfortunately smothers anything that was good about this movie. I watched the clock the whole movie, and then washed the dishes, which was a heck of a lot more fun.",1306368000,,387,4.791044776119403
8361200,2,B002BFBAVU,"This was probably the most boring movie I have ever seen. The plot was not bad but the way it was put together was. If they had made it a ""feel good"" happy ending or a ""that was so sad"" story it would have had a better response. I was very disappointed. This film could have been much better. And that was the saddest ending of all.",1273622400,,332,3.970149253731343
8361201,4,B002BFBAVU,"Good movie, very good performance by Nick Cannon. I can relate to this movie so it hit very close to home.",1258070400,2,106,4.095238095238095
8361202,5,B002BFBAVU,"Well, As a true Nick Cannon fan... for no reason other than he is a great actor and has a slew of Indie films under his belt, I feel in this film, he definitely delivered as a true soldier.  His Chemistry with Melonie Diaz is cute, pure, and fun... It really does remind me of where I grew up, with not too much to do but party, drink, sell drugs or even do them.  He's just another Brother who made it out of a ""swallow-you whole"" environment... the movie is beautifully executed throughout.  I'm glad that towards the end of the film, it finally hits (Cannon) on what's about to go down. Please believe it folks, it's real!...

P.S... I cried watching this movie too. :)",1251676800,2,672,4.309523809523809
8361203,5,B002BFBAVU,This movie provides a modern depiction of a soldier's last few days before heading off to war. It is both a love story and a buddy movie with broad appeal. So glad it is finally available on DVD! I caught it on Starz network sometime ago and have been watching the shelves. Cuddles up with someone you love (and get a tissue or two....),1251417600,,336,4.265625
