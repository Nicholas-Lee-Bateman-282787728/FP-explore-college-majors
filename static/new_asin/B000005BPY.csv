8363831,4,B000005BPY,"This film, which is actually nothing more than a retitled VAMPIRES AND OTHER STEREOTYPES, shows the energy and creativity that thrives in the low-to-no budget horror field. Director Lindenmuth, making his directorial debut here, brings quite a bit of freshness to what is an otherwise pedestrian affair. Anyone watching this should go into it not expecting Interview With The Vampire part 2. If you do, it's all over. But if you look at it for what it is, you should enjoy it greatly.",971481600,2,484,4.843373493975903
