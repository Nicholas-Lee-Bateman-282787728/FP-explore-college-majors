4653814,1,B005CRDG8E,"What audacity to name this film ""Incredible""!  The only truly incredible aspect of this movie is how much of it is actually shot... in an aquarium.  Not to mention... in an aquarium with species that DON'T live with these turtles in the wild!  Didn't you think at least SOMEONE out there would take notice?  The endless irritating shots of these turtles supposedly sharing an environment with brine shrimp (""Sea-Monkeys""), which only occur naturally in still-water salt lakes as in The Great Salt Lake, which are so saline, only these brine shrimp (hence their name) and a few fly species can survive, was shameful to relate to the public.  There is an old saying in motion pictures which is proven time and again:  If you aren't believable from the start... you are guaranteed to lose the audience.  No amount of slick cinematography or sweeping soundtracks can erase the ill-gotten taste of ""phony"".",1324684800,6,901,4.927152317880795
4653815,5,B005CRDG8E,I adore sea turtles and purchased this documentary to witness the life of the Loggerhead.  It is amazing and the underwater photography is spectacular.  A must see for everyone.,1322784000,5,177,5.068965517241379
4653816,5,B005CRDG8E,"Turtle: The Incredible Journey is simply the best film depicting the natural history, trials and tribulations, and the lost years of sea turtles to date.

The focus is a female loggerhead, hatched off the coast of Florida (Miami area?), past the ghost crabs and seabirds, into the Gulf Stream and the Sargasso Sea, traveling to Newfoundland, then the Azores, then a Caribbean island, before heading back at age 21 to make her own nest on an altered Florida beach. The film depicts the effects of storms and gyres, discusses navigation, shows threats from oil spills, plastics, and long-line fisheries, and discusses the evolution of a loggerhead's feeding habits over time. Yes, there are additional things that could have been included, but the director put together a nice overview of loggerheads. And with noted sea turtle biologist Jeanette Wyneken as a consultant, the film is about as ""correct"" as a film depicting the life of a loggerhead can be. I knew that the same turtle wasn't being followed for 21 years, and I was amazed at how the film was edited to carefully merge the various sea turtles and locations into one coherent story.

Excellent, excellent film of loggerhead sea turtles. This is a must see for the sea turtle enthusiast!",1322265600,,1247,4.933333333333334
4653817,5,B005CRDG8E,"Wow.

I've reviewed most of the sea turtle films and books that you'll find on Amazon, even some that you won't find here (most recently ""Last Journey for the Leatherback,"" by the Turtle Island Restoration Network).  All films have pluses and minuses, strengths and weaknesses.

4653818,5,B005CRDG8E,"This is one of the best nature documentaries I've ever seen, due in part to the filmmakers' insistence on visual clarity in telling the story.  In order to show the amazing migratory path of a Loggerhead Turtle, director Nick Stringer employs ""A"" level graphic elements (such as a 'zoom' shot from the Gulf Stream all the way out to low-Earth orbit in order to show the scope of this journey).  Yes, some ""purists"" will cry foul in that dry documentaries rarely make full use of the visual palette that modern technology provides. This same absurdist thinking would suggest that using special cameras -- or even artificial lighting! -- perverts the genre. But Stringer understands that clarity of communication, and audience rapture combine to make a more rewarding, more education and more entertaining piece.  I believe that most progressive documentarians will follow Stringer's lead by utilizing such graphics (although ""An Inconvenient Truth"" also made use of visual effects to present its case).  Absolutely terrific film!",1322006400,3,1028,5.25
4653819,2,B005CRDG8E,"I saw this movie in the theater it is quite a poor ""documentary"".  They are constantly trying to push their ""green"" and conservation agenda to the point where they constantly stage fake situations.  Even the credits say many scenes were re-created and staged in tanks, and even before I read the credits stating this, I could tell many of the shots were faked.  Some of the shots are pretty, but I have to take off marks for it not being a credible documentary.  There is a scene of turtle sex though, and I guess it is worth watching for that.",1322006400,3,544,4.41
4653820,5,B005CRDG8E,"What an amazing documentary that truly should be seen by everyone. For 200 million years the Turtles have roamed the oceans, even before the current continents were formed. The importance of this film is more than just a story of a turtle but a story of what we should be doing to protect the environment. Turtles have dealt with ice ages and other disasters but how can they compete with man/woman overpopulating the earth. This movie should be seen by everyone on the planet.",1321401600,3,477,4.690476190476191

I recently learned that in fifty years our oceans are said to contain more plastic than fish. Whether this prediction is accurate or not seems irrelevant. The bigger picture, that we are destroying the sustainability of entire ecosystems, is a far more profound ominous warning. So, when my child I learned about the amazing ancestral journey of the loggerhead and the 1:10,000 rate of survival while watching the amazing cinematography in Turtle: The Incredible Journey was invaluable.

If you are a turtle lover already and want to indoctrinate your small child, you will LOVE this film. If you are a harsh realist who would rather see the other 9,999 turtles get offed in many varied and gory ways, go find one of the Walking with Dinosaurs series.",1437523200,5,610,4.554545454545455

I adored it, the treacherous journeys these little turtles have to make is incredible I was so very sad to hear that very few of the hatchlings actually make it all all.
From the moment they poke their little heads out of the sand they are in imminent danger, I watched  a lot of the movie with the hands covering my eyes when it was obvious what was going to happen..

4653930,4,B005CRDG8E,"The documentary Turtle: The Incredible Journey (2009) follows the life of a female loggerhead turtle, who against great odds, manages to survive and grow to maturity, and continue the cycle of life for the species.

Directed by Nick Stringer, and narrated by Miranda Richardson, the journey begins with the birth of the turtle on a beach in Florida, followed by a harrowing and mad scramble to reach the ocean, as predators like crabs and seabirds prey on the tiny and relatively slow moving baby turtles, as they travel in droves across the sand.  Even upon reaching the sea, the danger is far from over, as birds swoop in and dive into the water, to snatch the young turtles in their beaks.

Those turtles that survive, must swim until they find a patch of seaweed they can find refuge in.  Fish and other sea creatures also make the seaweed their home, as it drifts into the Gulf Stream and is carried north.  Life changes dramatically, when a passing ship scatters the seaweed patch, however the hardy turtle manages to survive, feeding on jellyfish.

Over time, the female turtle matures, and leads and eventful life, including spending time in the Sargasso Sea, surviving a brutal storm off the coast of Nova Scotia, travelling across the north Atlantic ocean, and spending some time in the Azores.  Guided by instinct and an internal guidance system, the turtle eventually migrates to the Caribbean, where the seas are abundant with all kinds of life.  The turtle stays there for many years, until it is ready to reproduce.  Returning to the waters of Florida, she mates, and completes the circle of life, by returning to the same beach where she was born, to lay her eggs.

After the thrilling and brutally impactful opening sequence, the remainder of the film is more calm and even.  There is some cause for concern, when the turtle is caught in a storm, or becomes hooked on a fishing line, but in general, events are not hyped up to create a contrived drama.  The narration is also rather calm, understated, and natural, as the focus is mostly on viewing the animal functioning in its normal environment.  The preaching of any message, is kept to a minimum.

Nick Stringer is an experienced wildlife documentarian, and his film features some terrific camerawork and wonderful images, of the unique life cycle of the loggerhead.  You cant help but feel some appreciation for what an achievement surviving to an advanced age is for these turtles, which are apparently capable of living beyond 60 years, but because of their low numbers and reproductive rate, are considered an endangered species.

Turtle: The Incredible Journey is an educational and uplifting film that is highly recommended to children, and anyone who has an appreciation of the ocean or wildlife.",1362009600,,2775,4.884861407249467
4653931,2,B005CRDG8E,"The cinematography is beautiful, but set up at times, to further the story along. The announcers statements border on the ridiculous at times, saying things such as, ""200 million years ago the turtles were initially land animals, until the dinosaurs showed up and drove them to the sea. But the dinosaurs would have their revenge, as the land would not forgive them, and make them come back every year.""  How ridiculous is that? When they later make attempts at authenticity, they have made so many lame-brain statements that you cannot trust their story. I would not subject a child to this film unless he/she were warned that this is a fairy tale.",1361577600,2,649,4.794642857142857

It is an amazing story of survival that should be required viewing for everyone who goes to any beach. Today only 1 in 1000 hatchlings survives to reproduce. At this rate the oldest visitors to our beaches will soon just be a memory. This movie had me rooting for the little hatchling from its emergence from the nest until the end when it returned to lay its eggs only to find the natural habitat it was born in was developed.

  If it was used advanced technologies to reach its final quality, it doesn't matter.  What is really important is the message behind these pictures, it made me think... Will it be possible that Homo Sapiens will be alone, watching as the principal agent and cause of the destruction of our beautiful planet?",1336953600,,455,4.9605263157894735

4653946,2,B005CRDG8E,"Watched this on a whim on Netflix streaming and liked it for the most part.  Significant flaws with this file, however.

Pros:
- great story, following a turtle from hatching, across the Atlantic, in the Azores, off Nova Scotia, in the Carribean, and finally mating and laying eggs on the Florida shore.
- Beautifully photographed

Cons:
- The filmmaker readily admits that portions of the film were shot in tanks and used special FX and blue screen technology.  (Search New York Times film review and turtle for details)  So, not everything we saw was real.  Is this still a documentary?  Not in my book.
- The voice over cannot contain her love of everything green and dislike for human endeavors like ships, buildings, etc.

Given these flaws, I cannot recommend this film.

I would like to see a marine biologist review this film and comment on the special effects.",1329523200,6,869,4.778523489932886

The scenery is amazing and beside turtles is includes whales and dolphins. Its unbelievable what a turtle has to go through to survive and is amazing that they have outlasted the dinosaurs. We really do need to take much better care of the oceans. The movie is not preachy but very enjoyable and informative. We especially liked it because we live in Florida and often visit Gumbo Limbo Nature center where they rescue turtles. One of our favorite turtles Pheobe, who was released back into the wild, was the star of the movie.

4653950,4,B005CRDG8E,"I watched this with my kids, ages 5 and 7, who watch a lot of nature documentaries and generally enjoy them. This is the amazing story of a loggerhead sea turtle, which makes a 25 year migration from its birthplace on a beach in Florida to the North Atlantic, Africa, the Caribbean and back to the place of birth to lay eggs. It is based on the real migration patterns of these turtles, although obviously this is a fictionalized account - in real life only 1 in 10,000 make it. This particular turtle encounters every possible danger a young turtle can encounter, both natural and man-made. The narrator Miranda Richardson tells it like a story, and there is a lot of other animal and environmental facts woven in.

Overall, that should make for a great family film, and it almost does. It is just a bit long and slow though, for elementary-aged children, and my own wandered off several times. I enjoyed it, but also started getting restless in places. So I still recommend it, but know in advance that it might not keep young children fully engaged for the full running time.",1325203200,12,1078,4.585492227979275
