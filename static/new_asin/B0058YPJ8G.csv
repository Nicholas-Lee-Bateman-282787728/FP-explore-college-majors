4605203,4,B0058YPJ8G,great episode very interesting had me on the edge of my seat. I was sad to hear Catherine was leaving the show,1332288000,,110,4.045454545454546
4605204,5,B0058YPJ8G,"I hated that Petersen left and while Fishburn is a fabulous actor, I think he wasn't right for the part or the writers did him a disservice.  Ted Danson took over and it really was a great fit.  Then Marg Helgenburg left and I thought oh now CSI will suffer a significant loss until I saw this episode with Shue and I thought, it is a different show but a better one than it has been in years.  I look forward to each episode and was thrilled to find out it has been renewed for another season.",1331510400,,494,4.072164948453608

4605338,3,B0058YPJ8G,"The DVD played OK no issues with any episode. DVD has subtitles and some extras.  Just to let you know if you wish to finish the last episode you will need to buy the next season 13, 12 ends with cliff hanger episode again.  One last thing so does season 13, Series may have benefited from this type of ending not sure, but I am reluctant to buy the other season 14 for any price over $12.00 it cost too much in my opinion because Shue killed the show for me.

If you only wish to know DVD information read no further.  The following information is just opinion stuff and everyone has one.

If you like the new cast then I guess it is worth buying.  I do not like Elisabeth Shue's, character because she was annoying. The character seemed be smiling or have a smirk look constantly in nearly every scene. I guess Shue forgot to act or was poorly directed.  She seemed to be the primary person of the series being in too many scenes.  The other CSI original cast seemed to have been written into the background and series has begun to feel like the Elizabeth Detective Hour.",1456358400,,1073,4.303482587064677

4605442,1,B0058YPJ8G,Danson hasn't gotten any more believable in this role than in others that had me questioning Y him in this role.

I always allow a little time to become used to a new character in a show, particularly when they are replacing a long standing cast member, but please.... Do something. Elizabeth Shue just doesn't cut it it, I'm so sorry to say this, but her acting doesn't come up to scratch at all, not for a leading role and certainly not for one following Marj/Catherine. Shue has some very odd facial habits, like frequent quick grimacing, oh I don't know, she just can't play a big role. Get Sandra Bullock!",1431388800,,559,4.490196078431373

4605473,5,B0058YPJ8G,"What can I say other than CSI (the original series) is one of my favorites.  I was amazed at how well Ted Danson would be in this type of non-comedy series.  I think of the show ""Cheers"" any time I see him and was very surprised at how well he has brought his D.B. Russell character to the show.  My opinion, Ted has done the best job in the leadership role second only to the great job William Petersen did as Grissom.  When ""Grissom"" left the show I was sick as I didn't think they would find anyone to bring to the show what he (William) did.

4605617,4,B0058YPJ8G,"I just finished season 12 and am moving on to 13.  Mostly positive feelings especially about the episodes and some times wonder
how the writers keep coming up with interesting stories.  Initially I was not excited about Ted Danson (from past shows) but after
watching ""MOONBEAM"" operate, I became impressed with his performance, especially his toughness: I always thought of him as
a leftie wimp, but he is  good here.  Willows who I have had trouble deciding if I liked her or not left the show and was replaced by
a even more harder-to-understand (or like) female.  We shall see.  Fishburne was a good replacement for Grissom and left the series
a hero in my mind, ridding the world of that maniac serial killer very decidedly.  But I still miss  Grissom.  The episodes are fine; so
many good ones I will leave the decisions to the viewers.  It is amazing, though, to see all the murders and mayhem rising about
in a relatively small city (I live in NYC) but since the first season the city seems to have blossomed in size and energy.  I have no
real reason to visit it since I don't like gambling, but it does have some interesting sights.  A nice place to visit, but I would not
want live anywhere near there.  I am amazed how much the writers can put into the programs to keep it going for 14 years (at
least).  I am a big BONES, CASTLE & MENTALIST fan as well as a CSI NY and CHICAGO PD lover and I like stories that
deal with the personal lives of the characters as well as crime dramas. .  And they have all of that here, though things goeth slowly,
VERY slowly!  And yes, no Dr Sweets or Martha..Yeah!  If you liked the earlier seasons, you should like this one.  I only gave it
four stars because of the changing of the cast; but the stories hold up well.  I got all my DVDs from Amazon, of course.  Enjoy!",1409011200,,1816,4.332344213649852

4605652,4,B0058YPJ8G,was glad to buy this as I missed several episodes of the season.  can't wait for more to come out,1397606400,,97,3.85
4605653,5,B0058YPJ8G,"Love CSI!  Ted Danson makes a great addition to the CSI cast... Wish they'd give the ""good old"" characters more screen time though, and not always the new ones... Not a fan of Elizabeth Shue in this role... She needs to go.",1397001600,,223,4.309523809523809
4605654,5,B0058YPJ8G,Watched all the season first day she had it.  Will add to the rest of the seasons in the collection.,1396742400,,100,4.0
4605655,5,B0058YPJ8G,I love CSI and I so excited by how quickly my season 12 came to me and it was in perfect new condition,1396742400,,102,3.4782608695652173
4605656,2,B0058YPJ8G,"It's understandable that she would wish to quit and spend time with family...but her replacement, Elizabeth Shue, has always got the same mocker's smurk on her face, same things with her eyes, whether she's joking or looking at a corpse, plus she's constantly fidgeting/jerking herself left and right all the time - VERY POOR ACTING! CANNOT EXPRESS SENTIMENTS! Ted Danson is passable, though William Petersen was truly outstanding and an excellent non romantic match with Marg Helgenberger, perfectly expressing respect for each other positions as subordinate and supervisor. The best team indeed.",1396396800,,597,5.5
4605687,5,B0058YPJ8G,I have always liked the suspense in the CSI shows and I was not let downs in this season.  There was some twist in it that I had not expected but it made it more enjoyable.,1395360000,,172,3.7777777777777777
4605688,4,B0058YPJ8G,"After Grissom left and Langston came in, the show felt tired and forced. To be honest, I bought these discs because I had all of the previous seasons and I wanted to give it ""one last shot."" I am pleased to say I was glad to find the writing was crisp again and the episodes worth watching.",1394064000,2,290,4.105263157894737
4605689,5,B0058YPJ8G,I loved Gil and was hoping he would make an appearance. Love this series and always will. I think the acting is great and the evidence is always found. Good work bought the 13th season so will enjoy more.,1393372800,,204,4.256410256410256
4605690,5,B0058YPJ8G,As the season's go on and characters come and go... each season keeps on getting better and better! I am glad Ted Danson has joined the cast. He has made the lead character easier to swallow. His character is willing to learn from the rest of the team. Doesn't command allegiance right away.,1393286400,,291,4.509433962264151
4605691,5,B0058YPJ8G,"This show always impresses me. I have bought every season. The acting is always good, the twists and turns are great and the addition of Ted and Elizabeth and the always wonderful George Eads makes this show the bomb!!",1393286400,,218,4.615384615384615

4605693,4,B0058YPJ8G,"I wasn't thrilled when Ted Danson joined the cast and very sad when Laurence Fishburne left the show, but I've been surprisingly sucked into this season.  The story lines are very interesting and the backstory of D.B. Russell (Ted Danson) (Seattle connection, having a family, quirky stories, etc) are making for a MUCH better season than I anticipated.",1391558400,,353,5.086206896551724
4605694,5,B0058YPJ8G,Adding to my collection to all CSI DVD's.  It's a good show and I am hoping it continues.  Good Bye,1390694400,,99,3.9

Too bad Catherine left the show, too.",1388620800,,290,4.490566037735849

4605734,5,B0058YPJ8G,I thought Ted Danson did an outstanding job of stepping into some mighty big shoes left by William a couple of seasons back.  He has made it his own and it is nice to see a committed family man's take on this very stressful job.,1386547200,,228,4.066666666666666
4605735,5,B0058YPJ8G,"I have been a diehard CSI fan since it first aired.  I wasn't sure I could accept the star of Adventures in Babysitting as a blood expert, but her character has grown on me with each episode.  Same with Ted Danson; I wasn't sure I could deal with him in this role, but he's been great.  I miss William Peterson and Laurence Fishburne who were just classy beyond words.  I love having CSI marathons!",1386028800,,398,4.337837837837838

4605772,3,B0058YPJ8G,"I like Ted Danson as the replacement for William Peterson, and the writing is good enough, I just find the overall affect of the show rather depressing.

4605848,1,B0058YPJ8G,"As much as the CSI series has been a worldwide success, I seriously can not bare to watch it.
Firstly, just about EVERYTHING the CSI team do is forensically WRONG!  I cringe when watching the actors doing anything at all.
Generally, the story lines are quite creative, and really do get the viewer sucked in.  However, in real life non of the processes are correct at all.
It has got to the point in many continents that the CSI effect is now written in law.  Jurors are now informed about this effect, as too many of them have watched CSI and expect results ect quickly.  In reality this does not happen.

If you want to watch something slightly more scientifically correct may I suggest that you watch Bones.",1376438400,2,710,4.515625

4605852,3,B0058YPJ8G,"I haven't watched all of season 12 yet just about half the season. When they started season 12 I was already sad, Grissom was gone, Sara was stumbling along and now they wanna throw in two more characters? Well I like the new girl but I hate Ted Dansa's character. It seems he has taken all the heat out of it, since Catherine left I'm even more bummed! Will any of the original characters be on the show when it ends?!",1372636800,,419,4.185185185185185
4605853,2,B0058YPJ8G,I became a fan this year and have been watching the episodes as often as I can.  I became addicted...pleasantly so.  And then they brought Larry in...speaking of sucking the air from a room.  He was awful...so one dimensional...so boring in delivery of lines.  And they named him over Marg.  How rude.  But I became excited because he was leaving.  YEAH...but alas they brought in Ted.  The man has no depth of character...and his idiosyncrasies are like a tooth ache...UGH.  I will not be watching any more.  Watcher beware.,1371686400,,525,4.797752808988764

4605856,5,B0058YPJ8G,CSI has always been a fabulous show but this season showed how amazing they really could be! I was worried that Ted Danson would be too well known for other characters he's played; I thought I wouldn't enjoy it. But OMG! They brought it! This is my absolute favorite season since Grissom left - the standard is so very high - I cannot pick a favorite episode!,1368835200,,359,4.373134328358209

4605899,1,B0058YPJ8G,"Literary tributes took a turn for the overlooked in the Edgar Allan Poe themed TELL-TALE HEARTS, where the killer was haunted by the crime, where the ghosts stalked the killer thru-out the killer's daily life.

MAID MAN-ignored a BIG, BIG, BIG Las Vegas name, 0scar Goodman, the city's former mayor who appeared on the show for a second time. Goodman became the Faye Dunaway of Season 12.

C.S.I. DOWN, chock full of character development for new castmember Elizabeth Harnois'. The first episode centered around Morgan with her life in peril, taken hostage, with dad back at the police station in mortal fear. C.S.I. DOWN really played at the heart of the relationship between Morgan & Conrad Ecklie. A father's love was on full display. So character development for both Morgan & Ecklie. The events had a profound effect on their estrangement & father & daughter would begin the path to reconciliation. Where was the commentary from Harnois & Marc Vann? Why does character development end up so consistently ignored?

BRAIN DOE-the team is investigating the theft of brains, NUFF SAID!

CRIME AFTER CRIME-after having committed suicide in THE LIST in Season 11, Geoffrey Rivas got to make 1 final turn as the late, lamented Detective Sam Vega. This like THE LIST should have been a shining moment in the sun for Rivas who performed with aplomb for the 10 years Vega carried a badge.

GENETIC DISORDER-the first Robbins centered episode. We meet his wife Judi after she's arrested on suspicion of murder, Robbins has his private life upended. Their was a real chemistry between Robert David Hall & Wendy Crewson. They looked like a believable couple. You saw the unbreakable bonds of love between Judi & Robbins. Pamela Reed had a memorable turn as genealogist Donna Hoppe who was researching Robbins' family tree on Judi's behalf as her birthday present to him. Hoppe also shed's light on Greg's ancestry. When they finally do AFTER 11 YEARS OF NOTHING, an episode with Albert Robbins as the central character, they f()<k it up. Commentary was warranted from Crewson, Hall, Reed & Eric Szmanda. Think about this C.S.I. fans, 13 years into the show & WE STILL DO NOT KNOW HOW ROBBINS LOST HIS LEGS IN THE FIRST PLACE. They gave Paul Milander a family but what made Robbins an amputee is still a mystery.

STEALING HOME, an episode about the literal theft of a house, another round of gallows humor & the Special Guest Star Pair of the Sklar Twins, Jason & Randy. The twin comedy duo seen on BEST WEEK EVER, several shows on Comedy Central & the like.

C.S.I. UNPLUGGED, a thunderstorm rages in Las Vegas subjecting the entire city to power outages. With the lab even without juice, they must resort to unconventional means to solve a child kidnapping before fate takes a turn for the worse for the child in question.

ALTERED STAKES-a doctor murdered by triplets who were the result of the theft of their embryos who were born 10 years after each other as part of the doctor's twisted research. Quite an off-kilter episode that deserved some kind of notice.

HOMECOMING-the Season Finale & the return of Jeffrey McKeen. After McKeen murdered Warrick, it seemed as though we would never, ever again see his filthy, corrupt, treacherous scumbag face ever again, but we learn that even from prison McKeen in still the same worm he was when he was in Gedda's back pocket. The murder that brought McKeen back into their lives would dovetail into Season 13 & no commentary from Conor 0'Farrell after having been away from the show since before Barack 0bama was elected president, before Lauren Lee Smith & Laurence Fishburne joined the cast & long after both had left the series.

MS. WILLOWS REGRETS & WILLOWS IN THE WIND did not need commentary as Marg Helgenberger's departure from C.S.I. was sufficiently discussed on the Special Features. Here the producers screwed the pooch again, If they were gonna have commentary on these episodes, why not on ZIPPERED which began the entire Gabriel storyline? INCONSISTENCIES ABOUND!!!!!

The producers continue to show they just don't get it. Instead of making the DVDs better, they get worse & they still commit the crime of usuary by charging top dollar for very little in the way of content.

The final inventory of commentary. What we get versus what we DESERVED all along. Season 1, the director's cut of the pilot(BLU-RAY ONLY) Season 2-3, Season 3-6, Season 4-7, Season 5-10(C.S.I:TARANTINO STYLE discusses GRAVE DANGER), Season 6-5, Season 7-7 & ever since Season 8-only 2. The Grand Total-50 since Season 10 discussed on the Special Features the Season Premiere FAMILY AFFAIR. 50 out of at the time nearly 300 episodes. This is the total had the producers chose to give a sh!+, Season 1(BLU-RAY ONLY) all others DVD-15, Season 2-14, Season 3-15, Season 4-16, Season 5-17, Season 6-13, Season 7-18, Season 8-15, Season 9-9, Season 10-10, Season 11-14, Season 12-10, the GRAND TOTAL had the producers cared to give a sh!+, 166.

166 is more fitting for a television series that by the end of Season 13 will have WELL OVER 300!!!!! 0VER 300 EPISODES & ONLY 50 HAVE COMMENTARY OR A SPECIAL FEATURE THAT COVERS THAT PARTICULAR EPISODE. 50, that number is an embarrassment!!! It's a disgrace, a sign of laziness on a grand scale!!!!! What a disproportionate figure-50 for a show with over 300 episodes! THE SIMPSONS has commentary on ALL of the 233 episodes on DVD that premiered before C.S.I. debuted on television. Where THE SIMPSONS has been ported over to Blu-Ray, very little has to be added because Matt Groening & his team already threw in everything including the kitchen sink on the DVDs. THE SIMPSONS on all DVDs has commentary on EVERY single episode & C.S.I. lowballs us with 50. THE SIMPSONS is also cheaper, you pay less & get more. With C.S.I. it has always proven to be the opposite. THE SIMPSONS doesn't f()<k over Its fans. I have so much more respect for Matt Groening. Like Joss Whedon on FIREFLY alone, cares about his fans. Ann Donahue, Carol Mendolsohn & Anthony Zuiker rape us in the wallet & put less & less on the DVDs as the years go by. 0ver 300 episodes & only 50 have any kind of notice. THE PEOPLE BEHIND C.S.I. SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES. Another thing to bear in mind, they actually CHOSE not to honor their 100th episode!!! BITCH PLEASE!!!!!!! Tomorrow I begin sharing my displeasure with C.S.I. MIAMI.",1365724800,,6383,4.823583180987203

4606048,5,B0058YPJ8G,I was all ready to dislike Ted D.  I read the negitives thought they made sense...then I got the dvd and guess what...ive enjoyed the first 4 episodes and especialy Mr. Danson. He's quirky..up beat...which im thinkin this wonderful series could use.. and even tho some of the scenerios are ??? raunchy...gritty...well even shocking...i mean this 60 yr old gal thought nothing could surprise me after 11 years with these folks but that octopus scene was a jaw droping laugh out loud shocker... I still miss Grissom...wish he would come visit more often..how bout just to see Sara S...Him and Dansons character together would be a hoot.. maybe. At anyrate...i cant see...if you are really a fan of the whole series .. how you couldn't enjoy this latest chapter... Grissom would tell you..change is good..

4606049,4,B0058YPJ8G,"This season started the run of Ted Danson after the departure of Laurence Fishburn.  It also saw the departure of Marg Helenburg and the arrival of Elizabeth Shue.  Despite the massive upheaval of the cast, the thread of CSI solving crimes by following the evidence pulls the story and the series forward.  Danson's role as the leader harkens back to when Grissom was running the lab and is a more comfortable scenario compared to Laurence fishburn's sort of awkward ""lead"" as a new CSI.  I thought the abrupt departure of Fishburn's character arc...Played off as ""he was railroaded by internal affairs"" and ""went back to Baltimore with his wife"" were poorly contrived talking points to explain away the absence. I would rather say he was reinserted into the Matrix...  Fortunately, the departure of Katherine Willows was given much more careful attention in a three-part set of episodes which gave the fans a little better closure.  The advent of new characters gives the writers new avenues to explore.  They have set up a cryptic back story between the Danson and Shue characters which will be an intriguing aspect as the series moves forward...",1352073600,,1148,4.947916666666667

4606053,4,B0058YPJ8G,"This is one of the few shows that has stayed strong after 12 years! I've loved CSI since the beginning, and the show continues to grow strong.

After 2 and a half seasons, Laurence Fishburne has left the show as Langston. I love Laurence Fishburne, I think he is a great actor. BUT, although he seemed to be a logical choice to replace Grissom, he just wasn't that great. I mean, he was OK, but now I missed Grissom even more. This season, Fishburne is out, and his replacement? Ted Danson. Im not gonna lie, I was REALLY skeptical about this decision. So, is Ted Danson a good new addition to the cast?

Fortunately, the answer is yes! Sure, he is still no Grissom, but, he still gives a great performance as the new character Russell. He has that strange, fun quality, yet, different from Grissom. I love this new character, and he fits in nicely with the cast. A big surprise this season is, unfortunately, the departure of Catherine Willows. It's very emotional, but well written, and her character had a good departure. A few episodes after her departure, we get another new character this season: Elisabeth Shue as Julie Finlay. Overall, her character is OK. Im not saying anything bad about her character, we just don't know much about her yet.

As for the writting, it continues to stay strong. Sure, there are hits and misses, but, there is more good here than bad. Overall, I only have two little problems with this season: I REALLY wish Laurence Fishburne had a special guest appearance in the first episode. Although the first episode is written good and introduces Ted Danson well, you don't see Laurence Fishburne on screen to welcome Ted Danson.

My one other complaint, is that the final episode ends with (obviously) a cliffhanger. The only problem with the cliffhanger is that it just isn't as emotional and intense as it should be. Specifically, we needed AT LEAST one or two more episodes just to get to know Ted Danson and Elisabth Shue's characters, we just don't know enough about them yet. BUT, the season finale is still written very well, and also brings back an old enemy from several years ago (one that I was NOT expecting).

Overall, although the only things THAT special about this season are the new cast members and departure of Catherine Willows, this is still a solid (and a little emotinal) season. I LOVE CSI :)",1350172800,,2348,4.648192771084338

4606055,4,B0058YPJ8G,"After a rough couple of seasons, CSI has finally returned to near full strength....and most of the credit has to go to Ted Danson's character.  I'm not convinced about Elisabeth Shue's character.  I think she's a good actress but why do female forensic scientists need to be ballsy and tough....just let her be a good criminalist and not try to be 'one of the boys'.  Jorja Fox is always good and has become even better since her return as Mrs Grissom.  Marg Helgenberger was a loss but her character was pretty tired by the end. George Eads really needs to lose the tough guy thing.  In the early episodes, his sensitivity and lack of being a typical tough guy was endearing.  I get that Nick has had his tribulations over the years, but now he's just way too gung ho and John Wayne-ish....I find it just annoying now. But, for me, DB Russell was the stand out this season.  Danson is a terrific actor and his character is wonderfully understated this season.  Looking forward to season 13.....oh, and how about a change of scenery for Horatio Caine.  Caine in Vegas......could work......",1347840000,2,1089,4.659685863874346

4606087,4,B0058YPJ8G,"I actually had stopped watching this show when Grissom left as the only other character I really liked was Warwick Brown. I'm a fan of Laurence Fishburne but wasn't enamored when his character joined the show (the character seemed a little too gloomy for a weekly show). At any rate, I decided to give Ted Danson (D.B.) a shot and was pleasantly surprised. His character is slightly offbeat, like Grissom, but in a very different way. It actually spurred me to go back and watch the seasons with Langston and I found them to be better than I had anticipated. Langston was still a tad bit bleak, but not as much as I expected. I was glad to see Catherine go, so that also made this season better.",1346803200,,695,4.4375
4606088,2,B0058YPJ8G,"I have always been a huge fan of CSI so don't look at this review like I hate change because I embrace change. I found the first episode to be the WORST season transitioner ever. It took them half of the episode to explain everything we wanted to know after the events of season 11 so I find I could not really enjoy it. After that weird stumble, it got better and I grew to like Ted Danson's character. As sad and hard as it was to say goodbye to Marg(Catherine Willows), her last two episodes were the best and most memorable ones of the season. I commend the writers on doing her character justice and sending her off well. The episode ""tressed to kill"" I found really creepy in a good way. After that episode the rest of the season(except for the finale)wasn't even worth watching. At first I thought Elizabeth Shue might be okay in this and it would take a few episode for her to grow on me. However after watching her performance three weeks in a row, the only thing I was convinced of was that she is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. Nothing is genuine about her acting and she acts like she's better than everyone else. You can also tell that while George Eads(Nick) tries to get along with Shue's character ""Finn"" Jorja and Eric(Sara and Greg)could care less about her and want nothing to do with her. If you're fans of the original characters on the show then don't go out and waste you're money on this season. They push Shue and Danson's characters to the foreground so much that you see maybe 2 minutes of the original characters per episode or they are cut out alltogether. CBS should really listen to their fans more because with Shue's extremly bad acting and Sara, Nick, and Greg getting pushed to the backround it is highly likely that season 13 will be their last. Way to sink an awesome show CBS =(",1341964800,14,1827,4.360703812316715
4606089,4,B0058YPJ8G,"CSI is the long-running CBS procedural drama about a group of crime scene investigators in Las Vegas.  The show was a big hit for most of it's run and eventually became one of the most watched TV shows in the world.  However, the show had to go through some changes after original star William Petersen left midway through season 9.  They brought in film star Laurence Fishburne as the new lead and the transition appeared to go smoothly.  However, I think most fans can say the show eventually went into a rut creatively and viewership started to drop in seasons 10 and 11.  It was no longer the top show on Thursday nights.  After Fishburne decided to leave after a low rated season 11, CBS brought in long-time TV star Ted Danson as the new lead.  He played DB Russell, the new night supervisor and a former Seattle CSI.  Honestly, after I heard that Danson was cast, I wasn't in love with the choice.  But, to my suprise, Danson brought new life to an aging show.  I think the Russell character added some fun and quirkiness that had been missing in the Fishburne years and I think he gelled immediately with the cast.  I also think some of the stories in season 12 felt really fresh and the cast appeared rejuvinated.  The show also made the move to Wednesdays at 10pm and ratings were up.  It performed quite well against Law and Order SVU and was neck to neck with the new ABC drama Revenge for the top spot in the timeslot.

Unfortunately season 12 also marked the final season for long-time star Marg Helgenberger, who played CSI Catherine Willows.  Helgenberger left the show midway through season 12 and I think the writers did the character justice and gave Catherine a proper and memorable sendoff.  The Producers managed to work their magic once again and brought in veteran actress Elisabeth Shue as Marg's replacement.  She played CSI Julie Finlay, a former colleague of Russell's who has a conflicted past with him.  I also think Shue gelled right away with the cast and made the transition very smooth.

I'm not going to go into lots of details about the plots in season 12.  I will say this, it's a solid, well-crafted season and they utilize Danson and Shue really well.  There's a few multi-episode arcs and a very exciting cliffhanger to wrap up the season.  If you haven't seen season 12 yet, I highly recommend it.",1341100800,34,2338,4.583132530120482
