7333437,5,B011KG2JW4,Arrived in good condition. The Daniel Craig Bond fan we gave this to is enjoying. We like to buy older movies in sets to help keep discs organized and easy to locate.,1451779200,5,166,4.21875
7333438,5,B011KG2JW4,We love Daniel Craig's work and the Bond series seals his reputation as one of Britain's leading actors.,1451433600,2,104,4.833333333333333
7333439,5,B011KG2JW4,"Initially I balked at Daniel Craig as James Bond.  He's blond, he's short and he's not the classic handsome (at least in the early publicity stills) as I thought Bond should be.  Boy was I wrong.

Craig is as old as Connery was in Diamonds are Forever, but he shows that doesn't mean he's got to be paunchy and winded.  Craig is the first Bond in the entire series even including classic Connery to look like he could actually do the things he's doing on the screen.

This collection features all of Craig's Bond work with the exception of SPECTRE (and he says he's doing no more after that).  These are much more akin to the original Fleming books.  Gone are the quips-- Craig doesn't fire off a punchline after killing someone, he takes this business seriously and the series is refreshed and better for it.",1450137600,28,809,4.5

7333463,4,B011KG2JW4,"Something very unusual happened to the James Bond franchise when Daniel Craig and the writers and directors took over the reigns to this historic run. They created a James Bond who was human and vulnerable, the story lines fresh and almost believable. No longer the handsome, loveless agent with over the top story lines. This is what this series desperately needed. Like a shot of adrenaline to the heart of a long dying patient. I had given up watching the Bond installments long ago until my wife made me rent Skyfall due to the feature song by Adele. We were so impressed with the film that we immediately rented the two previous Daniel Craig films Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace which were also realistic and exciting. We were very excited to view the final installment Spectre as all four films run together. Although not quite as good as Skyfall, but very well done none the less. I highly recommend this collection. Hopefully they will add Spectre to the set to complete it as I have heard that Daniel Craig has decided to cease his affiliation with any future James Bond films (truly a travesty).",1480204800,,1110,4.697435897435898

A little disappointing, but had registered all before discovering, so didn't bother seeking return/exchange.  Otherwise, packaging and quality very good for the price ($14.99 for three).",1471046400,3,300,5.361702127659575

7333485,5,B011KG2JW4,"A James Bond Fan? These are a very inexpensive way to go Blu Ray with 007. While the packaging is not as fancy as some collectible series it is nice non the less. Almost did not buy it because when I first saw it listed it was listed as a single disc. Figured it had to be a really cheap version. But it does come as a separate disc for each film that is in a plastic case that slips into a white cardboard outer sleeve. I have not only the Craig set but the Pierce Brosnan set as well and plan on adding the rest of the Bond's as well. Three or four Blu Ray discs for under 20 bucks, not a bad deal at all.",1456272000,,607,3.7874015748031495

8724423,3,B011KG2JW4,"This seems like a great idea for the price, but you have to redeem the digital copies on VUDU and the sound and video quality on that service is super messed up.

On each digital download of the movies included, the sound was messed up beyond belief. Even after trying to download the movies multiple times to see if maybe there was an error in the download, the sound was still tinny, artifacted, lacking any low end or mid and in general was in places of louder volume, completely unwatchable. The picture quality was also super washed out and looked horrible. All this is fine if you don't really care about the digital stuff cuz the disc's are awesome and look and sound great, but if you're planning to get this because of the digital copies, I wouldn't bother, just get them on itunes and save yourself the trouble of being stuck using VUDU.

Thankfully this is a disc set and those look and sound great, but the digital sounds terrible! I think this is a problem with VUDU as I've had the same problems with other movies on that service while the same movies on itunes look and play fine.",1522195200,5,1095,4.442786069651741
