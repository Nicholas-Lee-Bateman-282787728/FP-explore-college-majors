3474453,5,B001AYWY7C,"Once again, the 10 Minute Solution series adds another fantastic workout to its library (and hopefully yours, too!).  I was really excited to try this workout and it did not disappoint.  I was curious to see how it would differ from the other pilates workouts in the series.  I really liked each section.  They do not repeat the same exact moves as others, though they do have different variations of some of the moves, like the classic ""One Hundred"" ab move.  I love the new moves that I have never tried before.  They are effective and fun.  I could really feel my muscles the next day, even though I work out almost everyday.  I am so glad to have been able to add this to my workout routine.  It is a must for any pilates or exercise fan!",1217203200,11,742,4.318840579710145

3474461,5,B001AYWY7C,"This is Suzanne Bowen's best workout DVD for beginning/Intermediate--(After two years of workout routines I still feel like a beginner.) Each session works a particular body part and is great for a total Body workout. Not only that but i felt the burn even though we only did three repetitions of many of the exercises. Generally Bowen and Sarago work in units of 8 which I like because it hearkens to the eight notes in a scale of music, and the moves keep a good rhythm. If any thing the moves are performed a little too fast sometimes, but I suppose younger folks and stronger people will find the speed fine.  It is a nice change up from the free downloads of Rebecca louise fitness. Still love her best.",1472601600,,708,4.488372093023256

3474481,5,B001AYWY7C,"I'm a long time 2-4 / week exerciser of everything from running to step to kickboxing. I've loved the Boot Camp series in the past, and this was my first time trying the 10 min solution. After a foot injury I've had to move away from all high impact stuff. After doing this video this morning- I'm hooked!  I'm amazed at the tightness I feel in my abs and concentrating on how a 'dancer' moves and holds posture made a huge difference in my movements.  I have a slight (very) sweat, not like kickboxing, but I honestly feel more in my body than I ever have w/ the others. Before today I didn't think Pilates was 'hard enough'- I've changed my mind.  The instructor is perfect in calmly speaking, keeping movements and exercises fluid, all the while reminding you of tight abs and posture.  This was perfect for the beginner, as the movements are precise, sometimes very hard- but you can see yourself working up to them perfectly if you stay at it. Self modifications are easy. Music in the background was almost unnoticeable- which is a good thing in that it's not distracting or pounding, but not too soothing where you feel like going to rest instead. By the end, I had those shakes in my thighs, my triceps feel a tad sore and I feel an incredible full body stretch. I'm excited to find a series that work the body w/out the jarring of high intensity types!",1433203200,5,1361,4.453815261044177

3474483,3,B001AYWY7C,"I really enjoyed the arms&elegant segments on here,the other segments not so much. I usually do the arms segments as an add on to my other toning workouts. I used to lift heavier and often did Jackie Warner&Jillian. Now that I'm 48,my body seems to be rebelling and I find my regular strength training moves are making my arms look too manly. I have been doing more Barre style dvd's and using light weights,which make my arms look toned,not bulky. I love the arms segment on here so much and usually do it more then once",1428710400,,521,4.4375
3474484,5,B001AYWY7C,"I love this workout.  It's effective and fun and the instructor gives thorough instructions and cues.  She's upbeat without being ""too perky"" or insincere.  I love the matrix menu so you can customize your workout based on time or needs - if one muscle group is sore from previous workouts you can skip that one for a day.  I wouldn't suggest doing just one 10 minute segment a day...I don't think you'll get much results.  But combining two or three or even all five and doing that several times a week, if you stick with it, you'll feel great!  I enjoy most of the 10 minute solutions workouts, and this one is at the top of my list.",1428451200,,635,4.338983050847458

I think Suzanne does a great job explaining each exercise before moving into it so you're not caught off-guard.

I love that I can pick how many 10 minute segments I have time for each morning, and it's absolutely ideal for the days that I'm not sure I really feel like doing any exercise.  I can always convince myself to do 10 minutes, and usually by the time 10 mins are up I'm up for another 20 or 30, just needed that initial push :).",1418688000,,411,4.1125

When she went to use it, there was this weird swirly ""film"" printed all over the cd and the cd does not play. Very disappointed. It was past the point of being returned and I could not figure out how to contact the company through Amazon for a replacement.

The video itself is very good. The arm and ab are my favorites",1395792000,,398,4.102564102564102
3474518,5,B001AYWY7C,I have been doing this Pilates DVD for over a year now. It got me toned for my wedding and I really love the instructor. If I slack and only do a couple segments a few times a week I can maintain...but to really see results do all 50 minutes 5x a week. I was a runner forever but Pilates really got me toned. Now it's all I do and I purchased 2 other Pilates DVDs but this is still my favorite.,1394236800,7,394,3.817073170731707

3474523,3,B001AYWY7C,I feel results and this is a good workout.  It just isn't my favorite and I don't use it much.  This instructor is just a little late when teaching workout moves.  She starts to do something and begins to tell the viewer afterward.  Some stumbling on words and exercises makes one feel as if she didn't rehearse.,1389139200,,312,4.421052631578948

3474548,5,B001AYWY7C,"I truly love this workout. I was seeking a challenging Pilates workout that actually works up a sweat, and this one does. In the past I was a cardio junky but got frustrated that I body wasn't being shaped the way I wanted it to. Pilates was my answer to actually making changes to my shape. Thinner thighs and belly, more shapely hamstrings, and chiseled arms. I usually do it in conjunction with about 30 minutes of cardio, but even done alone, it is a workout to be proud of. Some reviewers have commented on how it's not ""true pilates"". I can explain that it has plenty of true pilates moves, with variations of calisthenics added in, that makes it even more challenging and effective.
  After a few weeks of doing this video, my smaller muscle groups were being toned, which in turn, tightened up my thighs and waist, drawing them closer to the bone. I love all of the segments, and usually do them all together. Suzanne is very easy to understand, does not talk to much, and is a great example of a fit and healthy instructor. I would recommend this for intermediate to advanced. But even a beginner can get started on most of the moves.",1381276800,9,1143,4.464114832535885

3474550,5,B001AYWY7C,"I also own another Suzanne Bowen dvd and I love it. However, I was a little skeptical about buying another one as I thought perhaps the moves would be the same. The moves are not the same, and I like how she explains the moves before she jumps into them. I enjoy this one just as much as the first one. Sometimes I mix and match them so that I'm not following just a workout from one dvd. It's so much fun!",1377216000,,406,3.9634146341463414
3474551,5,B001AYWY7C,"I bought this DVD as I liked the idea that you could either do the whole 50 minutes or break it down to 10, 20 ,30 mins a day etc. Its great when you have a super busy life , but lets be honest everyone has ten minutes. Ive noticed some good results and ive only been doing it for 2 weeks. I tend to do the Perfect arms, Perfect thighs and perfect abs as they are my favourite.

3474564,5,B001AYWY7C,"I bought this pilates video along with the Lara Hudson ones. This girl is WAY better and easier to follow. I'm a beginner at this whole 'working out' thing and these moves pushed me. She gives you modifications to do so you don't hurt yourself trying to do something you shouldn't. If I put everything I have into this, I'm pretty sore the next day. I don't use 1lbs weight like she does, but 3lbs, which really make a difference.  After just a week of doing these I felt STRONG. I have a terrible back and for me to feel strong is a very big deal. I love that I can do one or two of these if I'm running low on time or I can do the whole video.

3474566,5,B001AYWY7C,"I'm a pretty lazy person, but the scale had been going up and my pants had been getting tighter, so I had to do something. I purchased this video after having some success with other home workout videos. I had heard of pilates, but never actually tried it before. I needed something low-impact because I have a medical condition that prevents me from doing vigorous activity. This workout is perfect for me.

Suzanne Bowen makes it easy to understand what to do during this workout. She breaks it down and goes at a relatively easy pace. In fact, after having this video for a month, I think she's going a bit too slow for me now, but I did appreciate it in the beginning when I was learning. The workout is broken down into five 10-minute sections, which is great because I can customize my workouts.

Since receiving this DVD, I've incorporated it into my workout routine and use it about 2-3 times a week. I'm definitely seeing a difference in my abs and thighs. I can feel muscle forming in my thighs and around my lower abs, near my hips. I'm definitely pleased with this video, and I'm glad I purchased it.",1363651200,4,1112,4.472906403940887
3474567,1,B001AYWY7C,"I don't if this is a 10 min solution thing, but this is my third workout with 10 min solution and it's once again so ineffective and a waste of time. You are better off looking for 10-15 min workouts on youtube or find other real workouts.",1363392000,2,239,4.1063829787234045

This one works very well for me because it concentrates on all the areas that needs toning - my arms (using 2 lb weights), my belly, buns & thighs.  The instructor is Suzanne Bowen.  What I like about this DVD is that Suzanne devotes an entire segment on stretching, not just something most instructors do at the end of a program.  This dvd is broken into five 10-minute workouts.  If you don't have 50 minutes to do the entire program, find at least 10 minutes a day to workout.  Like many things in life, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.

During and after this workout I felt great - as though I had a great workout, felt toned and as though my posture immediately improved, without feeling super sore or fatigued. I really enjoyed the workout, and felt that the pace was spot-on. I had also purchased the 10 Minute Solutions Quick Tummy Toners and felt the pace was way too fast to be able to do exercises effectively and get set for the next set. This workout has some great sections that differ in a few ways, but I felt that my whole body was engaged after doing them all. My favorite part was the last section, the Pilates Perfect Stretch. I believe this section could be done every day and would make you feel great. I also think this type of section should be at the end of all workouts. This stretch really calmed my muscles down from the workout and I felt stretched and toned.",1359244800,4,981,4.414364640883978

I first tried using three pound hand weights, but that was much too hard, so I ended up using full bottles of water (which equals one pound a piece) because I don't have one pound hand weights and that worked perfect.

I really enjoy all the sections, but my favorites so far are the abs and legs and thighs.

The stretching section is great too, but she does forget to stretch the arms.",1354406400,3,689,4.3858267716535435
3474579,5,B001AYWY7C,My favorite Pilates DVD. This is great for sculpting; it's challenging but easy enough for someone new to t to try out. I always feel it the next day paired with some cardio (or not).,1353110400,,183,4.257142857142857
3474580,4,B001AYWY7C,"This DVD is led by Suzanne Bowen, previously of Lotte Berk fame (under the name Suzanne Cook, she led the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lotte-Berk-Method-Hip-Hugger-Abs/dp/B00008DDVP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lotte Berk Method Hip Hugger Abs</a>&nbsp;workout).  Like all of the offerings in the 10 Minute Solution series, it features five 10-minute routines.  It also has a nice programmable option which allows you to ""Play All"" or to custom-create your own workout by mixing and matching 1-5 different segments.

In the introduction, Bowen states that these workouts fuse traditional Pilates with some ballet dance moves as well as hatha yoga for stretch and flexibility benefits.  I have provided a brief overview of each segment below.

PILATES PERFECT BELLY
Here Bowen begins with a brief overview of Pilates breathing.  She then introduces the mermaid legs, and keeping the legs in this position, she performs the Pilates 100, alternating the legs every breath series.  She continues with the legs in mermaid for the chest pull, adding a rock on the second set.  Next comes criss-cross with a 3-2-1-hold pattern, adding a leg raise.  She performs corkscrew with the ankles crossed, doing a set with the head down, then with the head up.  She does the same for the crossing straight leg stretch--i.e., head down for the first set, up for the second.  Coming onto hands and knees, Bowen moves through a brief plank/up dog, child's pose flow, repeating just a few times.  She concludes on the stomach with the Pilates grasshopper, crossing her bent legs behind her.

PILATES PERFECT BUNS & THIGHS
Bowen starts this routine on her side for some of the classic Pilates side series moves, including the up/down, passe, and 3-point.  Moving to bent legs, she performs leg raises, hamstring pulls, and circles; she then switches to an inner thigh focus with lifts and circles before repeating the entire series on the other side.  Moving to her back, Bowen does one legged pelvic lifts.  She then comes to her knees for what she calls ""deep knee bends""--in the Lotte Berk videos, they called this ""thigh dancing.""  Bowen finishes with a quad stretch.

PILATES PERFECT ARMS
For the first part of this routine, Bowen suggests using 1-3 lb. weights.  Starting in Pilates stance, she performs shoulder rolls, side raises, hug-a-tree, scissors, chest expansion, and several different positions of small circles, both slow and fast--because of this, I found this segment to be overly hard on the shoulders.  Bending forward, she also performs triceps push backs, bug, side bicep curls, and lateral lifts.  For the last four minutes of the workout, Bowen goes down to the floor for what she calls the ""plank series.""  She starts in a traditional plank position for push-up variations.  Next, she moves into a side plank position for sort of a star with a leg raise (this felt more like leg work than arms work to me!).  She concludes with reverse plank work.

PILATES PERFECT SILHOUETTE
Bowen states that this workout combines Pilates with ballet moves.  She begins standing in plie position for a standing version of the spine twist, then moves into plie with hug-a-tree.  Next comes front leg lifts with the thigh pointed forward and then out.  This is followed by the standing see-saw.  Bowen then goes to the floor for the Pilates push-up, doing a one-leg version.  Next comes reverse plank with a side passe and reverse push-ups.  She concludes with a half roll-down with a twist and then full roll-ups.

PILATES PERFECT STRETCH
Bowen begins on her knees here, moving into a stretch similar to gate pose in yoga.  Next comes saw and then seated hamstring stretch to either side.  This is followed by seated spine twist, moving into a hip stretch (a.k.a. firelog pose).  Bowen then performs a seated thigh stretch.  She transitions from child's pose into cat/cow stretches.  Next comes a series with down dog, 3-legged down dog, and low lunge with a hip flexor stretch (repeat on other side).  Bowen concludes the stretch segment with thread the needle, twisting child's pose, and a wide-legged seated forward bend.  This was quite a nice stretch series overall, BUT Bowen goes just a bit too fast for my liking; I really wish she had maybe included a few less exercises and held the moves for a little longer.

I found this DVD to be a pleasant surprise, as I enjoyed the routines more than I thought I would.  I particular liked the Belly, Buns & Thighs, and Stretch segments; the Arms felt more unbalanced, with its over-emphasis on the shoulders, and the Silhouette lacked focus.  Thanks to the DVD's programmable feature, however, I can just focus on the segments I like and skip the ones I don't.  I would say that this DVD is probably most appropriate for Pilates practitioners at the low intermediate and above level.  Other than briefly reviewing breathing at the start of the Belly workout, Bowen gives very little instruction about Pilates basics, and many of the exercises are definitely beyond beginner level.

So, if you are an experienced Pilates practitioner who enjoys adding interesting twists to traditional Pilates exercises, I would recommend this DVD.",1351382400,5,5214,5.096698113207547
3474581,4,B001AYWY7C,I always add this to my workout routine at least once a week and 20 minutes is really all you need to begin noticing a difference. Most importantly is not to rush through the workouts and pace your breathing. Once I started adding Pilates (at least this dvd )to my workout.. about 2 weeks later people mentioning how good I looked.,1349913600,,331,4.442622950819672
3474582,5,B001AYWY7C,"This was my introduction to pilates and it made me a HUGE fan. Suzanne is really good at explaining each step. The ten minutes are not wasted and you feel it the next day, especially the core exercises.",1342310400,2,202,4.342105263157895
3474583,5,B001AYWY7C,"I am an avid exerciser but consider myself an advanced-beginner when it comes to Pilates. That being said, I find ""beginner"" Pilates workouts too easy and have been looking for a Pilates workout that is physically challenging for a fit person, but not too advanced because I need the queuing and find it helpful to have the instructor talk me through some of the moves. I have another Suzanne Bowen abs DVD that I absolutely love, so I immediately bought this DVD when I saw her on the cover. I love this DVD! Every one of the five 10 minute workouts are fun, interesting and very challenging - yet not overwhelming to a newbie and are easily modifiable. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone that wants a fun and challenging Pilates workout.",1337644800,2,742,4.586466165413534
3474584,5,B001AYWY7C,"I was recommended this by my sister as I could no longer use a gym.  I have never stuck with DVD's before as I find them a little tedious, time-consuming and (being rather inpatient) they take too long to show a real differnece.  Not this one!  The muscle tone you achieve in just 3 workouts is amazing!  I lost an inch in a week and my bottom half is now smaller than my bust...after 2 weeks!  The mix of excercises from pilates, yoga and even ballet techniques keeps it interesting and the instructor is clear, concise and has a fabulous body so is a real inspiration.  There are 5 10minute sections and you can mix-and-match all of them or select 1 or 2 per day depending on time available and fitness level.  Because each area actually works the entire body you don't need to do the entire 50mins.
The instructor gives easier alternatives for most exercises, however, this is not for someone looking for an easy workout...it's pretty tough! Most people I speak to who have done pilates classes or DVD's say they didn't feel like they'd had a workout, but this is different. It makes you sweat quickly and continuously and keeps heartright at fat-burning level. I literally felt like I couldn't take anymore of an exercise when she switched to something else.
Buy it and I'm SURE you won't regret it!",1336694400,5,1303,4.5665236051502145
3474585,5,B001AYWY7C,"Ok I JUST finished doing this DVD and it is the first time I have ever even done pilates. Well, I AM HOOKED! I absolutely loved this DVD. You can pick which 10 minute workouts you want, so totally customizable to your needs, or you can do a full 50 minute workout (I am NO WHERE near that!) The first time doing it is a little intimidating because she moves quick, but that is part of the workout and the part you don't even notice is work. 5 minutes into my first 10 minute block I was already sweating. At some points, I was forced to stop. But the time flew by! When I say I HATE TO EXERCISE I wasn't kidding!!!
Soooooooo.......
If I can say ""I love this!"" you will too! I promise! Just do it! Order! Besides, if not now, then when?!?",1334966400,3,737,4.089655172413793

3474587,5,B001AYWY7C,"This is my favorite workout DVD ever, I alternate between this and Pilates for Beginners by Lara Hudson. They are both good DVD's but this one is a bit more challenging and most effective IMO. I love the fact that I get results without spending tons of time and afterwards I feel refreshed, revitalized. When done consistently 3 to 5 times a week at 20-30 minutes each time it really firms things up. I am tall and naturally somewhat of a full figured girl - Pilates keeps my curves sleek and defined, not puffy. It lifts, tones and sculpts the chest, upper arms, abs, buns and thighs. When I feel I've put on a pound or two, or I have an event I want to look extra good for, I do the whole DVD a few times a week. Highly recommended!",1334620800,2,734,4.212765957446808
3474588,5,B001AYWY7C,"There are so many things I love about this dvd. For one thing, Suzanne is an amazing instructor. It's fast-paced but with good coaching on breathing and proper technique, and it really makes your muscles burn! I do all five workouts at the same time, and it feels amazing. Caution: don't use this as a beginner pilates workout! I really benefited from learning the basics beforehand. This dvd is perfect for the next step up. There are interesting modifications on basic pilates moves, modifications that make the workout much tougher and much more fun! Wear something stretchy and light, easy to move around in. There is also a segment with moves inspired by dance. I used to work out hard at a gym 6 days a week, for years, but this 50 minute workout targeted all of my muscles in ways that I've never been able to do before. They're not just one-dimensional exercises; they really target everything. The stretches are great, too, and definitely important to do after every time you go through the dvd. I'm noticing definite improvements in muscle tone and balance after just one week. I highly recommend this dvd!",1334534400,2,1116,4.757731958762887
3474589,4,B001AYWY7C,"I have several of these dvds and use them daily. However, this one contains too much pause between exercises. Instructor needs to talk while doing the workouts.",1326499200,,160,4.962962962962963
3474590,5,B001AYWY7C,"I'll be short and to-the-point: the instructor is friendly, the pilates is legitimate, and you'll feel the burn. A great total-body workout for anyone who wants to lengthen and tone their body but doesn't have enough time (or money) for a pilates studio or full-immersion pilates program. I use this DVD regularly, and it's a must-have addition to anyone interested in the 10 Minute Solution lineup, or just looking to explore/expand their pilates repertoire!",1325203200,,459,5.216216216216216
3474591,3,B001AYWY7C,"Honestly the only parts of this video I liked were the ab and arm workout. Everything else was too easy for me. I wasn't sore at all. I guess I'm used to working out my legs and butt a lot more than this! Since I never work out my abs or arms this definitely worked for me. If you exercise every part of your body very frequently, I suggest you look into other videos, something harder!",1322438400,2,386,4.092105263157895

3474594,5,B001AYWY7C,"I use this DVD twice daily. I'm very busy and love that it only takes 10 minutes in the morning to get my day going, and 10 minutes in the evening to end my day with useful stretching. I do a different 10 minute Pilates Exercise each morning. After several weeks, they are still challenging. Suzie is has made a wonderful DVD which is challenging and user friendly. People with all levels of fitness could use this DVD and find it useful.",1314662400,,438,4.353658536585366
3474595,5,B001AYWY7C,"I just got this DVD a few days ago and decided to try it out this morning. I wasn't sure if I would do the whole thing, but I had so much fun with it that I didn't want to stop and I went straight through the video all at once. I have lots of experience in Pilates, I've taken lots of classes when I used to have a gym membership, so I was familiar with all the exercises. I definitely would say that this video is for the intermediate exerciser- there are some pretty intense exercises in this video, I even had to sit one out because it was just too intense for me. That said, if you have experience with Pilates and are an intermediate exerciser you will not get bored with this video and it will challenge you.  My muscles were shaking and I am definitely sore tonight! If you want a challenge and some new twists on some old moves this is the workout for you! My favorite segments are the abs, thighs and buns, and then the stretch. Sometimes I am disappointed with stretching segments in videos because they fail to stretch your entire body. I didn't feel that way at all with this one- my whole entire body felt stretched and refreshed by the end of the 10 minute segment, it was wonderful.  I would highly recommend this video- it is now my new favorite!",1312156800,3,1262,4.232365145228216
3474596,5,B001AYWY7C,I never have done Pilates before and this DVD really is fast paced! It does give you an incredible workout.  If you have never done Pilates before (like me) it will take awhile before you do the moves correctly. I will continue to do workout with this DVD but I'm also going to purchase a beginning pilates DVD.,1311897600,,311,4.362068965517241
3474597,5,B001AYWY7C,"With Suzanne Bowen's Pilates Perfect body, i have seen faster results (especially my arms) and most importantly, new and fun challenges. Suzanne cues perfectly and gives you the right amount of encouragement. No nonsense, yet understanding, it makes you just want to work harder. Of course, having her amazing body in plain view is pure motivation. I can honestly say I don't have a single favorite segment. They are all equally fun and engaging.

3474598,3,B001AYWY7C,"I got this dvd to do some pilates post pregnancy. I do like the set up of 10 min increments so that you can choose your workout and spend as little or as much time as you want.  However, the teacher goes a little bit fast and so it's hard to initially keep up with her but it's important to get the posture right in order to get the benefits. I got a pregnancy pilates dvd similar to this one before and liked it much more. The teacher was different. Some of these exercises are also too difficult for me and she does not really provide a good alternative (a step down to start you off before you can do the really hard poses).",1309305600,,627,4.056451612903226
3474599,4,B001AYWY7C,"I was doing the 10 Minute Solution Rapid Results Pilates video which was incredibly challenging at first, but because boring and routine after a while. This DVD is a great step up and definitely gets a lot of work done in a short amount of time. As far as the instruction goes, my only complaint is that some of the positions hurt my wrists.

The DVD setup is great because you custom pick which of the five workouts will play and in what order. I think it would be great if the music were optional because sometimes I'd like to turn up the TV and hear the instructors voice over my own music. That way it would take a lot longer to get old.",1306972800,,641,4.169354838709677
3474600,5,B001AYWY7C,"This will be my third DVD with Suzanne Bowen as the instructor.  While her instructions can use a little work (she needs to work on her transition), I still enjoy her routines.

I bought this DVD solely for the buns and arm workout.  Most of my DVD workouts supplement my main workouts and I needed a new buns routine as well as a light arm workout.  I haven't done her arm workout yet; however, I LOVED the buns segment.  Most were moves I have already done.  However, particularly in the case of the bridge move where you extend one leg in the air, Wow.  I know for some, it's probably nothing, but I LOVED it and it was seeing that quick snippet from the video clip that caused me to buy the DVD.  It's 10 mins so some may feel like they're being cheated.  However, for me, it will make me do this workout because I love the moves and I feel the benefit.

Even if the other 4 routines don't work out, this DVD was still worth it just for the buns routine alone.",1306195200,,964,4.162162162162162
3474601,4,B001AYWY7C,"As the title to my review says, I'm new to pilates. Prior to this DVD, I wasn't even entirely sure what it was. I'm a slightly overweight girl who has recently become a fitness enthusiast and decided 10 Minute Solutions was a good way to get started with pilates, as I've loved most of their DVDs that I've purchased.

While I'm still not *entirely* sure what pilates is or how it's different from traditional workouts, I have enjoyed this DVD a lot so far. I thought the moves would be difficult with the extra weight I have, and while it's definitely a challenge, it's doable. I really enjoy the burn and the growing strength I feel every time I do these workouts.

As always, I love the way 10 Minute Solutions breaks up their DVDs. I've gone straight through this DVD and got an amazing total body workout, but I also have tacked on one or two segments following cardio to get a little extra toning in. Either way, you can feel this working.

Not a big fan of the instructor, something about her kind of rubs me the wrong way, and I feel like she could be a little more clear about positioning and breathing in some segments, but overall I feel like she gives a good introduction to pilates.",1306022400,,1195,4.398190045248869

3474603,5,B001AYWY7C,I love this DVD and use it almost every day.  I live in Florida in the winter and forgot this DVD in Canada when we came down a month ago.  The first thing I did when I got here was get onto Amazon and order another copy.  The workout is challenging and not boring.,1291248000,,265,3.8703703703703702
3474604,5,B001AYWY7C,"There's a lot that I love about this workout DVD. I love the 10 minute format because it's so much easier to get yourself to do 10 minutes than 30 or 50. And usually, once I start doing one I end up doing another. I also like that you can pick and play each segment one at a time or tell it what order to play them in.

While I love Pilates, I like that this DVD doesn't just focus on abs--she incorporates some good upper body work and pretty good lower body work too so you can get an all over workout.

And when I had a broken foot, this workout turned out to be one of the few things I could do (although I had to adjust a few positions and skip the one all-over segment that does more on the feet). In short, I've thought about getting other 10 Minute Solutions because I like it so much!",1290124800,,793,3.95

Some of the moves are a little complicated, and even though I've been doing pilates almost every day for months I still found some of them very challenging.  You can definitely feel the burn in your core and legs just after one workout!  A lot of people on here were raving about her stretching segment, but I didn't think it was anything fantastic.  Not to say that it wasn't good, because it was, but I was expecting something more after reading the reviews.  I would say that overall, great workout to supplement other pilates workouts you've been doing, but choose something a little simpler if you are just starting a pilates routine (try her Slim and Sculpt Pilates DVD with the exercise band).",1283644800,,865,4.548387096774194

3474609,3,B001AYWY7C,"I have done several of the 10 Minute Solution DVDs, including 3 or 4 pilates programs, and have found them all to be well done. Cueing is good, instructors are easy to understand, and you get a good workout in 10 minutes. This one meets all but the last of those criteria and that is why I gave it only 3 stars. The 5 programs on this DVD are nice but are very, very easy especially if you are an intermediate or advanced pilates practitioner. The arms segment uses a couple of different moves, and the stretch segments are nice stretches but it moves very slowly-compared to other pilates programs-reps are low, and it just isn't challenging. At the end of it I didn't feel like I had done anything. It may be a great place to start for those who are new to pilates, want a gentle introduction, or have mobility issues that might make the approach used in this program more appealing. If you are an advanced pilates person and you want a 10 Minute Solutions program that is challenging try the 10 Minute Solution Quick Sculpt Pilates with toning ball.",1280102400,4,1052,4.455958549222798

The stretching section is excellent for keeping your muscles flexible and I like doing that one at the end of my workout.  I like the instructor she explains what you are doing in each exercise well without being too chatty.

The moves are easy but extremely effective. I have 3 kids at home so I love the 10 minute solution DVDs because i can do one segment then pause when i need to take care of the kids and come back later. this is PERFECT for people pressed on time or new moms. Just because it's a 10 minute solution doesnt mean it doesnt kick your butt! The first day i only did 2 segments ( belly, and stretching) and the next morning my stomach was so sore i couldn't hardly breath! all that in 10 minutes? yes its true! I started this 6 months after having my third child (after having GREAT results after my 2nd baby) and in one week i was feeling tighter and firmer and within 2 weeks the ""jiggle"" was gone and by the 4th week so was my cellulite. After 4 weeks of doing at least 3 segments 5x a week ( thats 30 mins a day) I had lost 15lbs of baby fat and could see definition in my tummy and had the tightest perkiest butt ive ever had! ONE MONTH of this DVD and my post baby body was ready for a bikini! and i'm not talking ""sort of okay"" im talking really bikini perfect. I build muscle pretty fast and most workout DVDs bulk me up but this one SLIMS you. tight firm and slim and even more flexible. This video is for you. don't think about it anymore just buy it!

3474616,5,B001AYWY7C,"I just did the Silhousette workout today, and my arms are still feeling it.  Pilates is a change of pace for me as I usually lift weights.

I love being able to just do 10 minutes if I'm pressed for time and I can pick which body part I feel like working, and on the occassions that I have time to do the whole thing, I'm dead afterwards - complete workout.  I also have the one with Pilates Bands and the 10 minute upper body workout is killer - just doing that 10 minutes every other day has toned and given definition to my biceps/triceps and shoulders.",1260057600,2,502,4.0606060606060606
3474620,5,B001AYWY7C,"I didn't get this from Amazon, but it is one of my favorite pilates videos.  This is great for beginners as she tells you alternatives but it's also good for someone who has been doing pilates for a little while and wants a new challenge.  I have a few other 10 minute solutions pilates videos and none of them compare to this one.  She goes rather quickly, so it was hard for me to keep up the first couple of times, but now that I'm used to it I'm thankful as I don't feel like I'm wasting time to listen to instructions.  The arms section is still very difficult for me.  She recommends using 1-2 lb weights but I just do the motions empty handed.  The stretch section is a great way to either cool down or do a relaxing workout when you're really not in the mood for a heavy workout.  She does a small warm-up at the beginning of each section, which is nice if you like to do them one at a time but she keeps them short so it doesn't hinder the workout if you're going through all 5 of them.",1258675200,3,995,4.0717948717948715

Easy to follow, and no extra equipment needed (except a light pair of hand weights, if you like).  All 5 segments equal a perfect 50-minute workout.

It is super challenging and pushes your muscle groups to the limit, but you can actually feel yourself getting stronger and progressing.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE that you can pick your own workouts and the DVD allows for a super transition between vs. other DVD where if you do 2 of the workouts you start all over form the beginning with warm up - this is seamless.  I will be getting the rest of the 10 minute solution DVDs.",1247184000,2,557,4.226415094339623
3474634,4,B001AYWY7C,"I really enjoyed this workout, I almost gave it 5 stars and wish 4 1/2 was allowed.  This is my first 10 minute solutions DVD and I'm definitely hooked. The first time I did only the arms section because I was pressed for time and since then I've done the whole 50 minutes.  Being able to split it up like that is really convenient.

A little about each section:
Abs: This wasn't the most intense abs workout I've done but it was good enough. I liked that it introduced pilates breathing as I am unfamiliar with it. Also doing abs first helped me remember to keep my abs engaged through the other segments.

Buns and Thighs: This section was enjoyable and challenging.  I had some trouble following because the instructor says something like 'we're going to do a pilates second pose stretch"" and expects you to know what that is.  But she explains it a bit and then it's easy to catch on by watching her.

Arms: This section was hard!  I couldn't do all the moves because my arms aren't strong enough yet.  I really felt it from the parts I could do and look forward to growing into the rest.

Silhouette: This was my least favorite section and I still liked it, so that says something about how good this DVD is. I found it a little confusing because she refers to dance poses but it easy to see what she does.  I also just didn't find this section very difficult, but it was nice since I was a bit tired from the rest already.  Also I think this section would be a good choice if you only had time to do one because it works a little of everything.

Stretch: This was fantastic!  One of my biggest problems with workout DVDs is that the cooldown/stretch section is too short.  A full 10 minutes was fantastic.  After this section I felt fully stretched out and only added one stretch of my own to finish it off (and that's only cause I'm working towards doing the center splits).

Overall, I definitely recommend this video if you're into pilates or want a sculpting video to balance cardio.  It's definitely one I'll continue working with regularly.",1246492800,7,2052,4.426666666666667
3474635,5,B001AYWY7C,"I'm really liking this workout - the instructor gives clear instruction while moving it along, encouraging but not tooo perky or intrusive.  I like the option to do any one segment or combine into custom workout.  I've been just hitting ""play all"" and feel downright virtous for getting a very good 50 minute pilates workout, with little strain to the knees, some good ab work,great lower body work, challening arm work, with a little yoga stretching included.",1246233600,,460,4.961038961038961
3474636,4,B001AYWY7C,"I like this video because Suzanne Bowen incorporates some classic ballet moves so that you really feel like your muscles are getting long and lean. It's definitely a challenging workout and requires a good sense of balance and focus.

However, there are several things that bother me about this video. First are the cues. Once Suzanne tells you what you'll be doing it sometimes take her a while to actually get to it, and there are several false-starts throughout the video where she'll go, ""Ready? Deep breath...and..."" By then I've already been holding the starting position for what feels like forever!

I also don't like how many pushups there are in this workout, both regular ones and ones done in a reverse plank position. If I do the arms segment of this video, I wind up repeating a lot of the same moves in the ""Perfect Silhouette"" segment, and that's a LOT of strain on my shoulders and wrists. I think that there are better ways to tone your arms without doing versions of pushups over and over and over again.

As I've said in other reviews, I have four of the 10-Minute Solution Pilates dvd's, and this one is probably my least favorite of the four. I still do it just to mix things up, but I don't look forward to it like I do with the other videos by 10-Minute Solutions.",1245801600,2,1288,4.51931330472103
3474637,4,B001AYWY7C,"Along with a diet, this 10 Min. Solution DVD is very helpful.  I have lost 2 pant sizes so far.  I did not feel as if I were getting anywhere in the beginning, but I quickly discovered after watching the DVD a couple more times, that breathing is an important key to Pilates.  Some of the moves were impossible for me at first, but I've worked up to it now and it continues to get easier as I go along. I do see and feel results in my strength, toning and flexibilty.  Susanne Bowen is great, and not annoying at all.  She explains the moves in easy to understand language and is a great movtivator without being a drill Sgt.  FYI I'm in my 40's and I think this DVD is good for anyone no matter your age.",1244505600,7,705,4.072463768115942

I love that the importance of stretching and flexibility is stressed in this dvd - this is an impact of exercise that people often forget about, even though it will help to maintain better posture throughout the day and will ultimately offer substantial benefits to how toned your body looks.

I particularly enjoy the 10 minute solutions dvds because you have one trainer on which to focus throughout the workout. Suzanne Bowen modifies the moves herself and there isn't anything else to focus on as you go through the workout segments. I've found in the past with other workout dvds that each person on the dvd is performing the moves slightly differently, which causes me to doubt my own form. With the Pilates Perfect Body dvd, I feel that Suzanne Bowen explains and illustrates the correct form quite well.

I've already begun to see and feel the results of these workouts. I do all 5 segments and feel invigorated after each workout.",1243987200,,1145,4.743718592964824

I bought this dvd a few weeks ago and finally started using it about 2x/wk in the last three weeks and I am very impressed with this dvd.  The instructor is very charismatic and to the point with directions.  The exercises are challenging but addictive; I can't stop with the first segment.  I feel empowered when I'm done.  I could already see my muscles toning up.  I also notice that my posture has improved without trying.  I also bought the other pilates dvd by ana caban, the beginners mat workout but I definetly prefer the 10 minute solution.  It is more challenging and trains the entire body.

The 10 minute segments go by so quickly that you don't feel that you had to ""take time"" out of your day to exercise.  The coolest part is that the DVD allows you to program your workout - so instead of playing with the remote control half the time, you can pre-program that you want to do the arms, belly and stretch workouts for a 30 minute exercise session.  The instructor is face paced, but gives good directions, and just when you are feeling like you can't do anymore - she gives you a quick stretch before the next round.  And combining the yoga moves with pilates makes you feel like every muscle is being attended to, stretched, and strengthened.

3474676,4,B001AYWY7C,"This DVD was my first introduction to Suzanne Bowen and I was impressed with her style - she is not in the least bit annoying and for the most part gives clear instructions, except they're a little rushed. The production values are top notch and you feel like you are in a living room with your own personal trainer.

If this was intended as a way to help you build on your existing Pilates routine by adding more ""oomph"" to your toning and sculpting efforts, or as a way to just grab some quick fix ten minute exercise breaks here and there, it delivers well. Especially on the arm section, which classic matwork doesn't do a lot for. I am planning to use this as a complement to the classic matwork, and probably won't do the whole DVD from start to finish.

Now for the flaws. Since you can mix up your own segments in any order you want, it's easy to overlook the stretching segment altogether. Mistake! None of the individual segments includes a warm up or cool down -which given the ten-minute format makes sense, but you still need to do it anyway or your muscles won't be warmed up and you could easily pull something and hurt yourself - especially if you have not excercised for a while and are out of shape.

I think this DVD is appropriate for all levels from beginners who have been exercising for a while on through to advanced exercisers as there are quite a few challenging moves. However, in performing a couple of the more challenging exercises in some routines, the instructor says ""if you're up for the challenge - do this."" So if you are not up to that particular move, you'll either be sitting there doing nothing or fast forwarding as there's no modification for those. Also, the instructor goes through the moves in each segment very quickly. Even the stretching seems a bit rushed, rather than fluid. The importance of stretching and warming up is only mentioned there, and not in the other segments.

From what I observed here, aside from some of the abdomonial and  legwork segments - particularly the ""sidekick"" series of leg moves - much of the work bears little resemblance to classic Pilates moves and offers virtually nothing in the way of philosophy on the importance of breathing, keeping the right form during movements (such as turning the legs out in the Pilates stance when standing and aligning the ""box""  - shoulders over hips - when lying down) and these oversights may offend Pilates purists. I think the issue could be resolved if DVD's like this one were referred to instead as Pilates-inspired exercises.

All in all, I liked it for the boost it will give to an existing Pilates routine. If you are looking to learn about the philosophy behind Pilates and get a good introduction to the matwork, I would recommend Ana Caban's DVDs highly - particulary beginning Pilates Matwork or Easy Pilates to start out with, and as a next step, her intermediate matwork DVD. I would also recommend two books - Pilates - Body in Motion by Alycea Ungaro and The Pilates Body book by Brooke Siler, two of the most informative works on the subject with great illustrations and photos on getting the technique right.",1231977600,14,3143,4.631956912028725
3474677,5,B001AYWY7C,"I considerd myself pretty well-versed in Pilates after mastering Lara Hudson's two DVDs and Suzanne's other ""Slim and Sculp Pilates"" DVD.  I was excited when I found this DVD because I loved Suzanne in ""Slim and Sculpt"" and ""Belly Blast.""  She is cute, fit, and gives GREAT instruction on form, timing, and breathing.

This DVD is nothing short of an amazing workout.  My only caution is... don't use this as a beginner or if you are not familiar with Pilates moves.  This is a fast-paced, high intensity workout.

The belly section is cool because it's not all the same tired pilates moves, and you can definetely feel it working.

The arm and shoulders uses not just the hand weights, but also just your own body weight to challenge you.  Again, some new moves, and some variations on old ones.  VERY EFFECTIVE.  I can still barely keep up with it after months of doing it.

The Buns and Thighs is just as fast and just as effective.  My husband likes watching me do the last move, where you are on your knees and you have to circle your hips.  It may seem like a come on, but trust me, it's a great way to tone your thighs.

Silhouette is probably my favorite segment because you get to work all the muscles in your body at once.  It's actually very fun and the 10 minutes is up before I know it.

The Stretch is quite beautiful.  Suzanne moves so gracefully in this segment, you can't help but want to mimick her.  It also leaves you feeling great.  It will help you relax and ease any sore muscles.  I would suggest isolating thi segment for use after ANY workout.  Continuation of this stretching will help you become more graceful.  The entire practice of Pilates has improved my posture, balance, coordination, and grace.  Not to sound sexist, but that is why I love Pilates because I feel it was designed for women to help us stay sexy and still hold up that air of refinement at the same time.",1231632000,80,1903,4.452173913043478
3474678,5,B001AYWY7C,I thought this was tougher than Suzanne's Slim & Sculpt Pilates.  She increases the intensity by shortening the rest between exercises and putting a new twist on pilates classics to make them more challenging. Suzanne is a great instructor.  She's friendly without being annoying and cues well.  There are some new exercises that I don't have in other DVD's.  The reverse push-up was tough.  It's done in table top position and you bend at the elbows and lift and lower your body while one leg is raised. The abs sections had familiar exercises but you varied your leg postion to make it more interesting. I preferred working out with light weights and my own body weight instead of the band as in her other pilates workout.  The stretch was very thorough.  Overall I thought it was a great workout and I definitely thought it was intermediate/advanced.,1230422400,5,853,4.801369863013699
3474679,5,B001AYWY7C,"I found these 10 min. exercises to be a little tough - but that's good. Maybe it's just me. But everytime I use this DVD it gets a little less difficult. The stretches are very good & most of the spots are a little different than usual. That's good also, because it could get repetitous at times. All in all this is a good dvd. I use it often.",1228348800,4,343,3.9855072463768115
3474680,5,B001AYWY7C,This dvd is great! It works you out and you can really feel that it is firming you up.,1227398400,2,86,3.5789473684210527
3474681,5,B001AYWY7C,"I've got two other ""10-Minute Solutions"" pilates workouts, and found this to be a great addition.  The exercises combine ballet and pilates movements and are completely different from those on Suzanne's other 10-Minute DVD.  You can build a customized workout using any combination of the five workouts, focusing on upper body, lower body, abs, etc.  The fifth segment is a nice stretch sequence that balances the workout well.

Suzanne Bowen is a terrific instructor.  She explains the importance of form while still maximizing each 10 minute set.  This workout is best suited to intermediate or higher exercisers.  I would particularly recommend it as a way to balance weightlifting workouts, as it tones the body without stressing joints and enhances core strength.",1224115200,2,768,5.297520661157025
3474682,5,B001AYWY7C,"Wow! I don't usually buy short workouts because I tend to think of them as ""easy""... well recently I have been very busy as a full-time college student working part-time so I decided to try this. I love it! I can honestly say that I look forward to my 10 minute workouts and can definitely feel it!",1222732800,5,298,4.245614035087719
3474683,5,B001AYWY7C,"To be honest, I must say that Pilates isn't my favourite type of workout and I normally avoid it, but I thought that buying a dvd like this where the pilates is 10 minutes long per segment, would be a great way for me to get to like it more and get better at doing it.  I was right.  This is a fantastic workout that anyone could do - even if you're like me who doesn't always enjoy it.
Suzanne is a great instructor - not intimidating in any way and instructs really well.  She leads you through classic pilates mixed with dance and even strength-training to mix it up and make your results amazing.  There is standing and floor work and a really good stretch at the end (or beginning if you play it that way).  Overall, this is a routine done at a faster pace than normal with a little more intensity but it's fine if you are beyond a beginner exerciser.  I think you need to already be familiar with Pilates to avoid getting frustrated that you don't know how to do the moves.  My two favourite segments are the arms workout and the stretch.
I really enjoy this and as always, love knowing that I can do as little or as much as I'd like, or can fit in, and I know this is very effective.  I really recommend it to intermediates and advanced exercisers.",1219708800,56,1255,4.2217573221757325
3474684,5,B001AYWY7C,"This pilates workout had my muscles shaking and burning in the first few reps. I loved every segment- It was very intense, easy to follow, and flowed very well. There are no fluffly moves in this workout- you can feel every exercise working.  Suzanne is upbeat and keeps the workout moving...there is no room for boredom- this workout is so unique and creative.  Every segment is so effective so you don't have to do the entire 5 segments. I was pleased to finish the workout with a great stretching segment, and trust me you need it after working so hard!!! This workout is definitely for all levels because she offers modifications. This is such a well-rounded workout. You will feel every muscle in your body worked!! My muscles felt stronger, more toned, and lengthened after doing this DVD.
