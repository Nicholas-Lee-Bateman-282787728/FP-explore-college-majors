4235789,5,B003ZVJFEI,received promptly.  I gave it as a present to parents.  They raved about it and passed them on to me.  Very enjoyable stories.  Was sorry that they did not produce more in the series.  I would recommend to young and old alike.,1298851200,2,226,4.285714285714286
4235790,5,B003ZVJFEI,"The children and I really enjoyed the series. We were disappointed though that we were left wondering what became of the characters. The series lasted one season. Well, I guess the rest is left to our imagination.",1294876800,23,213,4.783783783783784
4235791,5,B003ZVJFEI,"I saw this show when it was originally shown on The Animal Planet.  I believe it was their first drama series, but not positive.  The show isn't actually the same as the book Call of the Wild, but is an old fashioned western type series like some of us oldies used to watch as kids.  Miles is a 15 year old boy with his mother and stepfather, John Thornton.  They moved to the Yukon where John Thornton and his wife run their own store.  John was a hero back in the days before he married and still is.  The story centers on Miles trying to become his own person outside of the shadow of his stepfather and of his adventures with his dog and other characters from the town and strangers as they come in.  Some of the shows were humorous and some serious....you slowly got to learn more about each of the characters throughout the series and all of the scenery is breathtaking.  There are a lot of good scenes with John Thornton and his wife and she was one of the first career women.  In one scene a man tells John and his wife that when he comes back he'll take him up on that homecooked meal he promised and Mrs. Thornton quickly remarked that as soon as John learns to cook then he can offer the homecooked meal.  It's too bad it ended after only 13 episodes, but what a treat to have it all on dvd.",1284508800,48,1302,4.172

4235803,3,B003ZVJFEI,Although a very nice show the sound quality is so bad that conversations are impossible to hear - so you have to turn volume way up - then immediately down if music or action takes place. Makes for most uncomfortable viewing.,1438646400,,225,4.512195121951219
4235804,5,B003ZVJFEI,"It was a great copy of the movie, no issues and came earlier than expected",1436054400,,74,4.0
4235805,5,B003ZVJFEI,"This was Animal Planet's first scripted series, and it's an excellent one.

This adaptation of Call of the Wild is inspired by Jack London's classic novel, updated here to focus on Myles Challenger and Buck.  The quality, acting, scenery, pacing, cinematography and ensemble cast are all excellent.

As the show progresses, all of the characters' complexities are revealed slowly but steadily, like the layers of an onion.  Much like the Yukon miners panning for gold, the dust falls away to reveal the characters' hearts of gold.

This show is a refreshing character-driven series with equal amounts of adventure, suspense, action, drama, tenderness, and humor.  And while it is a family show, there are some scenes which may be upsetting to sensitive viewers (although interviews and articles about the show indicate that the distressing scenes were simulated and no harm came to the animals, thankfully).  Some of that is to be expected since this is a story that takes place in the harsh wilderness of the Yukon, after all.

Special mention must be made about Kavic, the Malamute/Wolf hybrid who plays Buck.  This dog is magnificent.  Buck's interaction with, and fidelity to, Miles are the show's emotional core.  And Kavic's eyes are so soulful and expressive.

I was saddened to learn that only 13 episodes of this series were produced.  The thirteenth episode ends with a bit of a cliffhanger, and the ensemble cast works so well together, so it would have been wonderful to have seen this series continue on to a second season and beyond.

Don't miss this one.  Kudos to an excellent cast and crew for making this series.",1434412800,2,1630,4.96309963099631

4235821,4,B003ZVJFEI,Awesome series for the boys in my family. Just skip the last episode which was meant to be a cliff hanger for the following season that was never filmed. It has the star of the show rebel and run away which is a very disappointing ending to a good series. My nephew was so into the series but HATED the ending!,1416268800,,310,4.098360655737705

4235833,5,B003ZVJFEI,"Don't expect this to be a film of the classic book.  Although, some of the characters in this series are loosely based on the Jack London book.  The spirit of the time of the gold rush is there.  There is no profanity but depicts the hashness of the life.  It is family friendly for older children.  Anyone who appreciates American history should appreciate this.",1394928000,,363,4.609375

If you do not own this particular version of the show, please try to get it and watch it. More of the earlier episodes will make more sense and have a completion to them. Not all of them but, a good many of them do. It is wonderful.",1380844800,,340,4.0
4235841,5,B003ZVJFEI,"Have not watched this yet, but I think this was a real bargain.  This is the type of show families should watch together,
