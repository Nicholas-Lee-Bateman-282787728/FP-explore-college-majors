7841575,2,6303201393,"I have been doing ab classes at my gym 5 days a week, then i moved and I have been looking for a good ab workout to do at home. I am fairly intermediate, and i found this tape boring, and not challenging at all!!! I kept waiting for the exercises to get harder, but they never did and I barely worked my abs. okay for beginners, BAD FOR INTERMEDIATES...",1066867200,4,353,4.057142857142857

7841578,5,6303201393,"this is a great abdominal routine, Hart is superb at giving great instruction and this video is very fun and safe...I use it as part of my choroegraphy in my Abs class I teach, and this is video good stuff, I highly recommend anything Leisa Hart stars in, her videos are by far the best of all the instructors out there, and its great to know that she still teaches in clubs and stays in touch with her consumers, unlike some of the other goofy instructors(Tony Little, Denise Austin, Richard Simmons). Hart is the best!",1056412800,5,520,4.484210526315789
