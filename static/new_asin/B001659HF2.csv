8260964,2,B001659HF2,"this is a film about a day in the life of a mildly egocentric, narcissistic, over sexed yuppie who is vaguely unhappy with his job. there, i just summed up the entire film for you... i give this 2 stars because it is fairly impressive that the guy made the entire film for less than $300, but overall it felt like a waste of an hour and a half...",1327276800,,346,4.028985507246377
8260965,4,B001659HF2,"Boxes was definitely a well conceived original concept that hits very close to home, in the factor that we live in boxes from day to day, and it is so true. Time from this project has not diminished the message and entertainment value of this story. For the factor that it cost $300 to make was and still is a testament to the independent spirit of filmmaking where some of the best ideas are conceived and brought to fruition, even when the big studios don't take notice. The work speaks for itself with the ""everyman"" in the new millenium named Wren Hannah. Vollman put in a very good performance as that everyman in corporate america that everyone can relate to in one way or another. I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to look at life from a different perspective that everyone in society can relate to...""From the cradle to the grave...we all occupy a box in one way or another...from our homes, to our offices, our beds, our cars..."" This is a film that must been seen to believe about the life and boxes we live in.",1216598400,,1036,4.457894736842105
