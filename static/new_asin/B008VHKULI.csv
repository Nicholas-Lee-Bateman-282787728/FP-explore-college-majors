8530898,1,B008VHKULI,"i rented this movie and it was dissapointing to say the least since the story lacked the reason and wisdom of the supposedly violent life of asiong salonga. i just could not follow the story since it was presented in fragmented sections of this saga. i could not find a compelling conflict in the story, if there was it has lost its significance because of the shallow dialogue and sennseless and non stop shooting.  i think the story really revolved in the boyish romance between grown men with their pistols and tommy guns. the flow of the story is like a drunken person wobbling around looking for words to be coherent. the screenplay lacked tempo and progression to make the movie to be compelling to watch. i expected the story would tell me details of asiong's life, his beginnings, his rise to power and his demise. it could have been helpful if there was some kind of running narration of the story to bridge every scene and introduce crucial players in the story. i cant form my own assumptions or speculations of the sequence of events since i was not born during that period. it could have been very informative and entertaining if this movie evolve into an action/docu-drama. i have seen public enemies with johnny depp and the story was succint and well written and carried a nice tempo through-out. there was progression of the story and the main focus really was the man and  his struggles and that said, also serve the purpose of anchoring the whole story into a tighly knit action/drama. in asiong salonga, i have to ask myself WHY? HOW? after seeing the movie. it seems the story was not written to tell the story but the movie was made to show the life of action salonga which was a bad mistake. i came out of this movie experience asking more questions than finding answers to the life and times of asiong salonga. again, a good story material written haphazardly. anyway, this movie brought very little excitement and 2 dollar hole in my pocket. for the philippine cinema to succeed....we need excellent storytellers, screenplays and writers.",1352678400,,2063,4.71191135734072
