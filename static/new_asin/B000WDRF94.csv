2967074,5,B000WDRF94,We have several of the Cedarmont Kids DVDs and I think the best review is how my kids react to them.  They love them.  I have a 10 month old who will immediately stop fussing when they are turned on and a 3 year old who asks them to be played over and over again and has most of the songs memorized.  I enjoy the variety and creativity they use for the videos which seem to be well suited for younger kids.  We will continue to buy more of their videos as they are a staple in our DVD collection.,1346716800,4,496,3.93

8222777,5,B000WDRF94,"These kids are really really good.  Great for toddlers and children  in bringing up good wholesome American patriots.  They have the usual, America the Beautiful, etc., though they did not include ""God Bless America"" to i could be wrng.  Included are Yankee Doodle, Bicycle Built for Two, etc., and all the old American kid songs.  Every toddler or young kid should have a copy.  Cedarmont also has a lot of Christian DVDs.  One for toddlers is ""Sunday School Songs for kids"" which include subtitles.  Same with ""Songs of America.""  Be careful to avoid the DVDs that are cartoonish.  The toddlers like the 'real kids.'",1498953600,,618,4.855769230769231
8222778,5,B000WDRF94,"Been searching for this DVD for awhile after finding  it all over YouTube.  This is a great way to teach kids patriotic, and folk songs of America.  I like the singalong version so that the students can see the words on the board and easily sing along. The videos are good to, with kids doing the performing, other kids appreciate that because they can identify with it.",1462147200,2,370,4.492537313432836

8222781,5,B000WDRF94,"If you are looking for enjoyable entertainment for young children with no violence, profanity, sexual overtones, and other disturbing elements of today's music culture, Cedarmont DVDs are the answer.  The songs are well done, the kids are adorable, and the scenery is wholesome.  I purchased these for my two year old granddaughter and she loves them. . . .will ask to watch even over the Disney movies, cartoons, etc.  She has always enjoyed watching real people and not animation.  Money well spent.",1400198400,3,501,5.073170731707317
