8154063,3,B000K2UEWM,"If you are looking for country, barn-style west coast swing, this may be your cup of tea. But don't expect the nightclub or ballroom versions of west coast swing here. Think more cowboy boot and less Saturday Night fever, more yee-haw and less smooth moves.",1376611200,,257,4.733333333333333
8154064,5,B000K2UEWM,"This DVD is 90 minutes long. I would guess that a leader should have at least one to two years of dance instruction and practice to enjoy this DVD. Some of the moves are easy, but some are hard, and may require a professional instructor to learn the pattern correctly.
Some patterns covered: advanced starter steps, tucks, rolling passes, advanced wraps, advanced whips, shoulder rolls, stops and freezes, and much more. The list of patterns can be found at Dancelovers web site. Or do a search for the Grant Austin DVD for sale, and eventually you will find the site that has the list of patters.",1248912000,,597,4.6415094339622645
