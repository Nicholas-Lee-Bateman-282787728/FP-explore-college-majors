The video is well informed about problems facing mature persons and works to address those problems.  This is not a generic workout but one that is soundly research and well produced.",1218412800,,360,4.650793650793651
8268891,5,B001892KUK,"I have been taking Pilates with MaryBeth for the past two years both as a personal trainer and in specialized classes.  This video demonstrates exactly how she interacts with all of her clients to obtain the best results for each individual.  The color coding in the video gives everyone, regardless of their condition, a chance to obtain the results they want at their own pace.",1214179200,,379,4.815384615384615
8268892,5,B001892KUK,"This DVD is the best that I have ever used.  I currently own about 8 different exercise DVD's and have been using Mary Beth's exclusively since I obtained it.  She takes time in explaining the why's and how's to accomplish results.  Even though I'm 60+ with limitations, I have been able to maintain a good level of exercise and have seen RESULTS. Most other DVD's leave you laying on the floor thinking ""Are you kidding me, I can't do that, I'm not 25 anymore!""  Mary Beth presents her program as a Personal Trainer in your home, one on one, and I like that.  I also like the color coded categories to target certain areas.  She has certainly planned and thought out a perfect exercise plan for the mature body.  Thanks so much, Mary Beth for helping my cousin, Pat, and now myself.

8268893,5,B001892KUK,"MaryBeth is just the best.  You won't be disappointed with this DVD! I have had the priviledge of training with her personally.  She also helped my husband enormously when he was very physically compromised. She has the best credentials and is very in tune with the needs of adults of all ages, especially those over 50.",1209945600,,320,4.696428571428571
