4188073,5,B003SF4G7M,Burt Wolf is extremely entertaining and very informative.  The videos are fun to watch and give a great overview of Europe.,1341014400,5,123,4.857142857142857
4188074,5,B003SF4G7M,"My family and I enjoyed this set of travel videos very much.  The quality of photography was good, the narratives excellent.  We didn't want them to end.",1328659200,19,153,4.62962962962963
4188075,5,B003SF4G7M,"Great DVDs for those who like to travel and want to travel.  The most beautiful sceneries in the European countries, their cities as well as their country sides. Also, the greatest information on hotels and restaurants also.  The greatest information on restaurants and their cuisines.",1320969600,17,285,5.311111111111111
4188076,5,B003SF4G7M,"I'm not great at writing professional sounding reviews, but I did want to take a moment to share my opinion of this dvd set. I really enjoy Burt Wolf's style. He is respectful and knowledgable, and manages to keep things fun at the same time. I purchased this dvd set at the same time as a Rudy Maxa set, and I enjoy Burt Wolf much more! I'm pretty much done with the Rudy Maxa set.

In this dvd set, Burt Wolf takes you to a variety of places all over Europe. He shares historical details throughout each episode and also explores achitecture, culture, art, food and more. I especially enjoy watching this in the winter months as it is warm and inviting, and gives you the sense that you are traveling to beautiful places. It leaves me wanting to find more of his programs!",1316217600,37,774,4.375
4188077,2,B003SF4G7M,"This was disappointing. I expected more interesting sites and commentaries. I will not
be interested in purchasing any of these items again.",1385769600,,140,5.409090909090909
4188078,5,B003SF4G7M,I only caught one of his shows on PBS in the past. I really am a fan of Rick Steves. Burt puts a different and delightful spin on world traveling. I have to say that I will be purchasing more of Burt Wolf's travels.,1378339200,,215,3.909090909090909
4188079,5,B003SF4G7M,I would highly recommend these travel DVDs to any armchair traveler interested in Europe.  Burt Wolf tells you the history of the region with beautiful scenery.  He has a good sense of humor which comes across in each DVD.,1376956800,5,222,4.666666666666667
4188080,5,B003SF4G7M,"Burt Wolf shows that originally aired on PBS are casual, funny, and filled with valuable travel information. After seeing several episodes of Art Wolf's journeys we decided to purchase the Boxed collection of 6 DVD's. Some shows are ""dated"" however, the photography and basic information is still valuable. We found his descriptions and suggestions to be so helpful that we booked a 30 day trip to Austria, Germany, France, and Amsterdam and also booked a Rhine River and Danube River cruise per his documentary on a certain brand flatbed cruiseline. Burt jokes often during his presentations, he is quite a character. You won't be disappointed.",1375660800,2,645,5.152380952380953
4188081,4,B003SF4G7M,The quailty of the content was good but the film was not as clear as it should be at times.,1375142400,,91,3.6
4188082,1,B003SF4G7M,"This show would have the potential to be marginally interesting if Burt Wolf could only focus on something other than plugging the local church(es) then plugging the local alcoholic beverages followed by plugs for his other favorite businesses followed by some more church-ing with lengthy expositions on various saints or their relics. Then again, making infomercials is what he's good at. [...]

Almost every show starts with some exposition of a local church. It then proceeds to some establishment which serves alcoholic beverages and maybe some sort of food or snacks. Invariably this is followed by a visit to some business, preferably a four-star restaurant owned or run by a 'friend', to elaborate on its 'glorious' provenance and outstanding selection of wines - or - by a stint on one or another group-touring firm's services or hotels (preferably a four-star hotel), with some of the favorite businesses (because he's got a promotion deal with them) being the river tour (cruise) operators - with a plug for the great selection of alcoholic beverages available on board; then there are more churches or vineyards with the requisite wine tasting as you make selected stops.

Then, of course, there's more about 'The Church' and its 'traditions'.  The 'Milan' episode takes all of 60 seconds to get to Saint Ambrose and his church.

Oh yes, he also has a yawner of a program on stamp collecting. I suppose that show falls under the category of 'traditions' as well - who knows?

This approach might be engaging once or twice but it gets stale at lightning speed.",1374451200,9,1571,4.980916030534351
4188083,5,B003SF4G7M,We play this at work so prospects have something to watch while waiting for us to finish up with customers. They love it!,1370649600,,121,4.304347826086956
4188084,2,B003SF4G7M,Sounded like a scratch but was continuous throughout the producrion. Ithe interuption in the dialogue was very distracting. Would like replaced,1361750400,,143,5.857142857142857
4188085,4,B003SF4G7M,Burt Wolf gives a different perspective on traveling & we enjoyed this very much. What we did not enjoy was the cruise DVD's. You really do not get to see much of the countries he is visiting. It is more about the cruise ship & shows how limited you are at what you can expect to see when traveling by ship through Europe.,1361664000,10,322,4.126984126984127
4188086,4,B003SF4G7M,"Very well done! I learned some interesting things about the culture and the traditions of Germany, France and Italy. I hope that one day I will be able to go and visit these wonderful places.",1356912000,,191,4.485714285714286
8404225,5,B003SF4G7M,We enjoyed his sense of humor. We also liked the background information that we learned.,1457222400,,88,4.933333333333334

8404228,4,B003SF4G7M,"While I really enjoy Burt Wolf and Travels and Traditions, I am a little disappointed that there are only 2 episodes (average) per disc.  I have several Rick Steves travel discs that contain a minimum of 6 half hour episodes per disc.  I would like very much to have seen more episodes per disc in this set.  Just like Rick Steves, I enjoy watching Travels and Traditions daily and learn a lot.  I also enjoy Burt's presentation so for the money there should have been many more episodes per disc.  Two is not nearly enough, considering Burt's body of work.",1430438400,3,557,4.53

8404233,5,B003SF4G7M,"These are great CDs--and what a fantastic price!  It gives another look other than Rick Steve--who is also very good.  It's just so helpful to actually SEE the places you are going, rather than just reasing about them.",1390262400,5,218,4.7105263157894735
8404234,5,B003SF4G7M,"While the competition between travel shows is heating up -- there's Rick Steves, Rudy Maxa, and others -- Burt Wolf consistently impresses.  The shows are so good that even after you go European cities he visits, you'll still enjoy the shows.  Just like other major travel show hosts, he visits people and places that few regular tourists will ever meet or experience.

The episodes have a delightful mix of city and country sites, history, dining, interviews, and clever jokes.  These videos and the ongoing broadcasts about Burt Wolf's American tourism and food stories make for great viewing.  This box set counts as one of my best Amazon purchases.",1386374400,5,652,5.0
