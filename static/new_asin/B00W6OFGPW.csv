7125512,5,B00W6OFGPW,"The best film of 2012 (in my opinion) is now in the Criterion Collection. Packed with new features and a new transfer supervised by Wes Anderson, this is an odd tale of young love as only Anderson can tell. This film just had everything I wanted and more from Wes Anderson. I don't know what else to say.",1442707200,24,304,4.258620689655173
7125513,5,B00W6OFGPW,Very good movie. I loved the story. Very outlandish childhood love story. The kids in this can really act. Especially Jared Gilman. Great direction and cinematography.,1483920000,2,167,5.461538461538462
7125514,5,B00W6OFGPW,Awesome film... and a beautiful digipak.,1472688000,,40,5.833333333333333
7125515,5,B00W6OFGPW,"I was amazed. I mean, I hoped and expected to like it. And I was already familiar with the Wes Anderson style. But I wasn't prepared for such a tour de force. This is an awesomely satisfying film, delicately balanced between irony and romance, despair and hope, adolescent and adult. And, of course, delightfully stylish and playful in its camerawork and writing.",1472342400,,363,4.870967741935484
7125516,5,B00W6OFGPW,"This is an amazing master of a really fantastic film. The Criterion Collection really went pretty far out there, as always, to make sure the film was presented at the very best it can be. If you're reading this review, you are already aware that Wes Anderson is one of the greatest directors of our generation. He worked with Criterion to master, and provide the supplemental materials for this film. The included paper items are stunning and awesome as well. The supplements include an issue of ""Indian Corn"" Magazine, as well as the map of the island in which the film is set. The story will intrigue you. You will laugh, you will feel sad, and you will think about your own while you watch this film. Bill Murray, Ed Norton, and Bruce willis all turn in fantastic performances here.",1458259200,5,785,4.614285714285714

7125524,5,B00W6OFGPW,Great!!!!,1446076800,,9,9.0
7125525,5,B00W6OFGPW,"Ok let me preface this review by admitting that I wasn't really the biggest Wes Anderson fan before I saw Moonrise Kingdom. Owing more to unfamiliarity than anything else. Now that Ive seen most of his movies I can see why he provokes such an emotional response. You either think that his films are meandering, boring and pretentious or you love his whimsical storytelling, the quirky dialogue, an Buster keaton-esque film making style. Either way most people familiar with his work feel passionately one way or the other.  Now to the film. I saw Moonrise Kingdom about 3 years ago. The fact that I feel compelled to write this review shows how the film stuck with me long after the viewing. Real art does that to you.

SPOILERS

Set in  Rhode,the story is about an orphaned boyscout and a beautiful young girl who have been pen-paling each other throughout the coarse of the summer. One day , after a tumultous fight with her parents the girl decides to run a way and finaly rendezvous with our precocious scout sting into motion a hilarious turn of events that youd really have to see to believe. Ed norton plays the hilariously inept, but caring troupe leader, and Bruce Willis, in what might be his best role since Looper gives a standout performance as the clueless , local sheriff whose also having an affair with the girls mother. throughout the course of one eventful weekend we find half the Island trying to catch up with or star crossed couple, while they alternate between trying to elude their pursuers. and get to know one another as well. The theme of young love is handled with class here, though make no mistake this is a comedy before any thing. The 1960s East Coast setting also plays a huge role in the film and is perfectly captured here. Watching this film i felt a little pang of regret, like one does when glimpsing scenes from a bygone era. Im a product of the 70's and 80's but I watched a lot of oldies with my grandparents and the nostalgia that I had while watching this film was palpable. Excellent acting should aslo be noted , with Cate Blanchet showing up in a scene stealing cameo as the stern, by the book, child welfare agency administrator. Harvey Keitel also makes a hilarious appearance.",1445990400,14,2226,4.613636363636363

8712338,5,B00W6OFGPW,"This is a review for the Criterion Collection edition as I assume if you bought it you enjoyed the movie. This edition was a great surprise, the packaging is great ,and in keeping with the tone of the film, and the inserts are unique and well thought out. Along with the film you receive a picture of the characters, a fold-out map of the island, and your own edition of Indian Corn (the scout magazine), which includes reviews of the movie written by kids (a great touch in my opinion). If you are a fan of the movie and want something a bit special to add to your collection this is a perfect choice.",1504828800,2,602,4.2894736842105265
