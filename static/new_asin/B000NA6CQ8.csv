2763902,5,B000NA6CQ8,"One of the best movies I have ever seen,too bad we don't make movies like this in the USA. You cant go wrong on this one.",1213833600,7,121,3.6923076923076925
2763903,5,B000NA6CQ8,FOLLOWING SUCH A SAD STORY IS NOT EASY BUT WELL DONE AND CAPTURES YOU FROM BEGINNING TO END.,1209254400,,92,4.166666666666667
2763904,5,B000NA6CQ8,The movie never mentions a Yeti as someone else had mentioned possibly being in a book. This film was full of action.  Unbelievable story.  He crosses from near Alaska all the way to Iran.,1206748800,,188,4.5
2763905,4,B000NA6CQ8,"This film is the story (based on one man's true experiences) of a German POW who is sent to the far reaches of Siberia in July of 1945.  Says a Soviet officer not long after his arrival at Cape Dezhnev prison, notwithstanding the end of the war:  ""You'll never leave this place.  You're going to be buried here.  All of us.""  & ""this place"" is a lead mine near the Bering Straits that resembles what hell would be if it was characterized by extreme cold as opposed to fire.  Determined to escape and return to his family in Germany our protagonist herein (by the name of Clemens Forell) struggles to survive as fellow prisoners drop dead around him; whether from a bullet to the head for hesitating a moment upon a Red Army officer's instructions, or from simply being worked to death.  The first hour-plus of this albeit long film is thus devoted to the Soviet Gulag aspect of this film---the bitter cold, the harsh landscapes, cruel Stalinist treatment; in sum, all that is the farce of Communism's ""Workers of the World Unite"" claptrap as bodies are treated as animals.

Say, how many times have you seen on film any visualizations of a Soviet Gulag/concentration camp?  Take all the time you need, I'll wait as you count the numerous films about Nazi Germany trying to name but one that shows up Stalinism for what it really was; ie., more akin to Nazi Germany than Hollywood would like you to believe.  This is a rather well made film, mind you, but it is also significant for its portrayal of this aspect of Soviet brutality.  The rest of the film concerns the triumph of the human spirit as this German escapes from Soviet Hell and attempts to make it all the way back, over barren rugged land, through Siberian ice, over dangerous rivers, to Germany to see the family who thinks him dead.  Do give it some of your time (well, it's a little more than some, as this film is rather drawn out and a bit long) should you get the chance to view this film.  It's a story worth seeing.  Cheers!",1200787200,102,1994,4.487534626038781
2763906,4,B000NA6CQ8,"My region 3 Hong Kong DVD of the film is in German DTS 5.1 with English & Chinese subtitles, presented in anamorphic widescreen 1.78:1 aspect ratio with 158 minutes !  Do try to find a decent version of this DVD by all means !  You won't regret it !",1195862400,4,249,4.061224489795919
2763907,3,B000NA6CQ8,"This is an entertaining movie, don't get me wrong.  But as the old cliche goes, the book is definitely better than the movie.  Read the book first, THEN check this movie out.  Regardsless, the story (which is mainly true) is incredible.  It deals with a former German POW who escapes from Siberia back to Germany.  The original book was written after Josef Bauer, an author, heard that a former POW, Clemens Forell, had seen a Yeti in the Himalayas.  There must certainly have been some creative license when Bauer recounted the tale, but it is still an amazing story.

Unfortunately, the movie glosses over or removes many central characters to the book which probably would have bogged down or considerably lengthened the movie.  Regardless, the move is still entertaining. My only complaint is the cheesy love scene between Forell and the native Central Asian girl.  It is Harlequin romance on film.  Blah...

Otherwise I recommend it.",1193788800,14,938,4.948717948717949
2763908,5,B000NA6CQ8,"very good drama. I have seen it for several times on TV before I got my own DVD copy. Unfortunately, the DVD contains cut version. The scenes that are cut are not substantial, but really helps to keep the track of a story line",1192752000,5,226,4.159090909090909
2763909,2,B000NA6CQ8,"I think this movie could be OK if it wasn't portrayed as a true story. The story is a complete fiction and absolutely non believable. A guy escapes from a prison camp at Dezhnev cape - that's the farthest tip of Chukotka peninsula, right across the bering strait from Alaska. He has nothing but a backpack, a handgun with a handful of shells, a compass and no map - and he starts walking in the mid of North Siberian winter! After a few hundred miles he would have to cross Kolyma - the harshest place in the Northern hemisphere, where average high in January is around -40. The guy would be dead after the first night in the open. By the way, if he traveled in winter he would only have from 0 to just a few hours of light each day.  What did he eat every day in that limitless white void? Where did he spend the nights? How could he keep himself warm when there is nothing to burn? He wouldn't last more than a few days in a winter forest in Siberia, let alone crossing 1000 miles/km of tundra.
At the and he re-appears in Turkemenistan. During those years a white guy with an accent, no documents, no knowledge of Russian customs would be arrested immediately at any railway station, at any transport junction. And he crossed thousnads of miles or km and nothing happened to him! Pure fantasy and nothing more.
A KGB man that once in a while materializes out of nowhere in front of the main hero no matter in what place of the huge country the main hero is, is another completely unbelievable character. Apparently, the escapee had a GPS tracking device imbedded into him, otherwise how would the KGB guy know where to meet him in this huge country? Why in Turkemenistan rather than Azerbaydzhan or Estonia or whatever?
In addition, the author did not have a clue about Russian/Soviet realities at all. The main hero gets a false passport with a name Petr Ivanovich Ulyanov - fine, but what about the accent? Just tell them you are Latvian! Yeah, Latvian with this name. It's like John Irving Smith saying he's got an accent because he is Russian!
If you want to know more about Gulag, read Shalamov's stories, in particular, ""Kolyma Tales"" by Shalamov.",1457049600,,2156,4.486005089058525

2763913,4,B000NA6CQ8,This movie kept my interest.  The main character was a German soldier who was sent to a prison in Seberia. Russia.  How he escaped and survived is the main idea of this story.  It was well told.  The will of the human spirit to want to survive is clearly depicted in this movie.,1433376000,,278,4.188679245283019

2763916,4,B000NA6CQ8,"After watching this film which is based on a true story, I realized that the really great German heroes of the Eastern Front were not the Knight's Cross winners or the super aces, but men like Clemens Forell: this diehard soldier endured the harsh Soviet captivity and the backbreaking work as a POW in Eastern Siberia's mines, escaped in an almost deadly and frightfully forbidding environment, survived in central Siberia for 3 years helped sometimes by local tribesmen, and finally managed to cross the Iranian border to come back to Germany and reunite with his family. This is an amazing film about a man of incredible willpower.",1428969600,,634,4.934579439252336

2763926,3,B000NA6CQ8,It is really too bad they had to deviate so far from the book.  The book was magnificent.  The movie was OK.  I am not a fan of subtitles and somehow missed that the entire movie was in German.  There is nothing worse than reading subtitles as fast as you can to your children who can't read that fast--it gets to be a little tedious.,1413676800,,334,4.092307692307692
2763927,5,B000NA6CQ8,My husband really enjoyed this film.,1411603200,,36,5.166666666666667
2763928,4,B000NA6CQ8,Grim reminder of the cruelty of the Soviet Communists'. Story was a little too long although interesting. I think pursuit by the Soviet officer was a little unbelievable. You have to admire the endurance of anyone who could survive through the conditions that this person experienced.,1407369600,,284,5.195652173913044
2763929,4,B000NA6CQ8,Very interesting -  should have requested the Book (English) at the same time.  Oh well next order I will correct that mistake,1406937600,,126,4.681818181818182

2763931,4,B000NA6CQ8,"If I had not had to wait a long, long time to get a copy of this DVD, I'm sure I'd have rated it higher.  It IS very good.  But I think when a prisoner went missing from the Gulag in Siberia, it was reasonably assumed that he would die in the wilderness, and I doubt that so much time, effort, and money would have gone into tracking done one man.",1401753600,,347,3.8732394366197185
2763932,5,B000NA6CQ8,What a great story of courage and determination. It is amazing what a human being is capable of when necessary.,1400284800,,111,4.6
2763933,5,B000NA6CQ8,"This movie brings to light Russia's brutal treatment of WWII POWs. One can certainly sympathize with Adolph Hitler's view of the Russian mentality as that of a brute. In light of today's politics between Russia and the rest of the world, specifically Putin's schemes to annex foreign soil to Russia, one can see the veneer of Russia civility is indeed very thin. This is a great movie demonstrating some people can overcome all adversity when they are challenged.",1398384000,,463,4.948717948717949
2763934,5,B000NA6CQ8,"Let me state first off that ""As Far as My Feet Will Carry Me"" has, on Amazon.com, subtitles, but the movie is so captivating that within a few seconds of watching it, I forgot that it was subtitled. The lead character (a German soldier captured and imprisoned by the Soviets) is so humanly mesmerizing that It is easy  to identify with his plight, i.e., to put yourself in his shoes. His eyes, body language and attitude portray the horrible events of his new experience, pain, anguish, etc., as he begins his existence as a prisoner in a labor camp, forced to work in the mines in a bitterly cold climate in a remote environment making escape extremely difficult. This is a far cry from his former life as a family man and well-thought of German soldier. Again, I loved it.",1397001600,,774,4.5285714285714285
2763935,4,B000NA6CQ8,This comment only holds true if you can read German and get your hands on the original work. The movie does it justice but the introduction of characters who did not appear in the book was a spoiler for me at least. The acting and photography are great. If you have never read the book then you will certainly enjoy this unbelievably true story of perseverance,1396483200,,360,4.46969696969697
2763936,5,B000NA6CQ8,Excellent historical movie.  Awesome cinematography and acting.  I will watch again.  It is an Inspiring and empowering story covering three years and 8000 miles.,1396051200,,162,5.666666666666667

2763938,1,B000NA6CQ8,"A pretty wild tale.  So wild, in fact that I did a bit of internet research on the guy.  I leave you to your own conclusions.  There is quite a bit of info about person that is quite contrary to his stories.  Parts may be true, but my belief is that this is pretty much a tall tale.",1394841600,,282,3.810344827586207

2763941,5,B000NA6CQ8,"It is astounding what the human mind and body can do and endure  when it sets its mind to it. The story of Oberleutnant Clemens

Didn't like the depiction of intimacy with the Native woman although there may have been some truth to it, that's the only part that would lower the rating when watching w/ children.",1389139200,,230,4.634146341463414
2763946,5,B000NA6CQ8,This is an epic movie.. Can't believe this poor guy the troubles he has gone through to simply go home. Deserves ten stars,1388793600,,122,4.3478260869565215

2763949,4,B000NA6CQ8,"A well made film that showed the cultural differences of a post war american vs Inuit natives, you travel along with the 2 stars of this film and feel a love or bond building through their attempts of mutual survival only to be met with tragedy. A solid performance by the main Actors, some of the supporting roles were a bit weak.",1379462400,,331,4.354838709677419
2763950,5,B000NA6CQ8,"I have just finished watching the movie and my eyes are still watery after this amazing story.

2763951,3,B000NA6CQ8,The story ends abruptly when the central character crosses the border and arrives back in Germany. You never find out whether he reunited with his wife or what happened after he returned. I found this lapse disappointing. Well written and interesting story. An epilogue on what happened to the remainder of the German slaves in the Soviet Union would have been nice as well.,1374537600,,374,4.859375

First in Italy, later sent to the Eastern Front,at war's end Clemens finds himself 'guilty of crimes Russia' and is sent to Siberian prison camp, where conditions are intolerable.  With the aid of a fellow prisoner, a doctor, Clemens manages to escape.  Through various encounters along the thousands of miles he travels, Clemens does indeed arrive before Christmas several years later.

2763962,4,B000NA6CQ8,"I read many of the reviews before ordering this movie.  I bought it so my son could hear real German (takes German in HS).  I found the clarity of speech was exceptional - we could clearly hear everything spoken during most of the movie, and having the English subtitles was great.  I thought the acting was ""just OK"" and I also felt the film lacked continuity in places.  But, having said that, our whole family really enjoyed the film and I would recommend watching it for the great story, beautiful scenes, and pretty good action.  Also, I feel this movie is very appropriate for young adults (e.g. teenagers) - there wasn't a lot of gratuitous swearing and killing.  The biggest weird thing about the movie is the camp commander trying to hunt down the escapee for years - that just wasn't credible.",1328400000,,803,4.619718309859155
2763963,5,B000NA6CQ8,"What a well done film! as usual, a foreign film that takes the time to develop the charactors and let you see and feel what they do....not all visual stimulating action.  This is a true story,(how close to the facts, I don't know), filled with quality content.  the main actor does a fantastic job, as do all of the supporting actors. One of the best films I have seen.  being a foreign film, it does have subtitles, but the acting is superb and would have lost so much if dubbed in English.  Not slow moving, but done in such a way, you'll get lost in the film, much the same as with a good book.",1327795200,,597,4.165217391304348

2763966,4,B000NA6CQ8,"An incredibly inspiring account. It sort of makes me want to read the book because of certain questions I have like a Soviet Army officer chasing Forell all the way from where he escaped solely focusing on him seens unreal & then then meeting him has he crosses the brifge into Iran & standing aside to let hin pass seems definitely ridiculous. Then after the very dramatic encounter with his uncle Forell tentatively approaches his house, peeks in the window THEN RUNS & HIDES WHEN HIS WIFE & CHILDREN LEAVE FOR CHURCH???!!!??? That seems totally unbelievable after travelling all that distance giong through all those hardships to return home. The very brief reunion in the church was totally unsatisfactory & nothing is stated as a postlude to the film about Forell or his family which again seems very unsatisfactory. So maybe I'll read the book.",1308700800,,850,4.86896551724138
2763967,4,B000NA6CQ8,"Very interesting story about the conditions of the POW's that were kept in Siberian internment camps during and after WW2.
Working in a lead mine makes the prisoners start to go crazy and in a last ditch effort to not die in the mine the story details
an escapee as he makes he way across Siberia.  With the help of many natives he overcomes tremendous odds.  The book is not
as good as it could be (in my opinion) but still a very interesting read.",1307664000,,449,4.270588235294118
2763968,4,B000NA6CQ8,"Having watched this DVD twice I decided to find and buy the book to try to get the answers to some unexplained facets of this remarkable story -- parts of which, as depicted in the film, are simply unbelievable.
Most importantly I wanted to understand, how 'Forell' (the name used to disguise the true identity of the subject of the film and book) got from the point where he left the train carrying him east into Siberia to Cape Dezhenev.

From my personal knowledge of the Trans-Siberian Railway (and the BAM Railway, constructed well AFTER the events depicted,) the nearest railroad siding would be SEVERAL THOUSAND, perhaps FIVE THOUSAND, KILOMETRES from the Cape, a near impossible distance for any fit and experienced person to walk in good weather let alone a half starved and freezing prisoner in mid-winter.
According to the book, written and published in 1955, his journey after de-training was continued in 'convoy', (that is under strict regime by brutal guards hell bent on weeding out those unfit for slave labour at the final destination,) by reindeer drawn sled, each one of which carried twenty prisoners plus guards.
This phase of the journey took TEN WEEKS and saw the continuing decimation of the original contingent of 3,000 that left Moscow down to just 1,600 by the time they reached their final destination -- almost within site of Alaska.

Apart from getting the answer to this intriguing question I found that the epic adventure as related in the book, ghost written for 'Forell' by an author of considerable experience and repute, and who was also a veteran of The Russian Front, bears almost no resemblance to that depicted in the film. Whole incidents shown in the film are not mentioned in 'Forell's' authorised account of his time in the GULAG or in Siberia as a whole. On the other hand many incidents detailed in the written account, which is likely to be more factual, are not shown in the film ---- for which it is all the more a poorer depiction of this epic tale of survival against remarkable odds.

I understand that film-makers must be selective about what they can depict in a given amount of time, and that a 'Love Interest' is almost mandatory, but the divergence between the original book, and the cinematic version, from beginning to end, is breathtaking in the extreme.
How 'Forell' arrived in Russia in the first place is not as depicted in the film. It seems, according to the book, he got there in a much more interesting fashion. Also the relentless pursuit of 'Forell' by an individual officer of the KGB (MVD) appears to be 'cinematic licence'. No such individual is even hinted at in the book, the only brushes with authorities who might return him to The Cape are very incidental and shortlived.

In short the book is MUCH MORE rivetting, entertaining and believable. If the film interested you then the book will leave you SPELLBOUND. !!!!!!!!!!!!! Once started it almost demands to be read to the conclusion without a break. Sadly at the end of it will you probably ask yourself, as I have, why did the film have to be at such variance with the facts as related by ""Forell"" ?????????.

Next I must hunt down a copy of the 1950's German TV miniseries which told the story (in 6 parts ?????????) to see how they handled this epic tale.
But for the casual viewer a great tale.",1305072000,,3329,4.72289156626506
2763969,4,B000NA6CQ8,"An entertaining film about Clemens Forell, one of the very few people that manage to successfully escape from the Gulag. A German soldier in World War II, Forell was made prisoner and sentenced after the war to 25 years in a labor camp in the most remote patch of Siberia, near the Bering Strait, north of the Arctic Circle. Amazingly, he not only escaped the camp but made it all the way from there to Iran mostly on foot (if you don't understand why this is an amazing feat, you can look at a map).

The film is more sentimental and melodramatic than it should be, but is still a worthy and entertaining movie, even if at more than two and a half hours is a bit long. One of my favorite parts is when after escaping from the camp he joins a couple of gold prospectors (the no-good prospectors seem almost out of a Western) and they sail through a remote uninhabited river that crosses beautiful conifer forests (that part of the movie, though, was apparently filmed not in Siberia but in Belarus). Even though the movie is based on a real story, some scenes shown here are hard to swallow, like the idea that the camp commander in Siberia followed him all the way to the Iranian frontier only to let him go at the international bridge. My guess is that while the main story is true, the filmmakers embellish it quite a lot.

Few known actors in the movie (at least to me), though I recognized Andre Hennicke and Michael Mendl, who played Generals Wilhelm Mohnke and Helmuth Wiedling in Downfall. Also, beautiful international model Irina Pantaeva (who is originally a Buryat, a Buddhist ethnic group in Southern Siberia) plays one of the Chuckchis that shelter Forell for some time after he escaped from the camp (another good section of the movie). Hennicke plays a fellow prisoner while Mendl, even though he is a German is one of the camp doctors (why he was allowed that role is never explained).

Some viewers might object that the movie shows the Soviet guards brutality toward the German prisoners, while not explaining that the German soldiers during the war probably engaged in far worse atrocities. Up to a point, this is a fair objection. But one should be mindful that a movie dramatizes a part of reality (whether is based in a real incident or not) and is not necessarily a newspaper article trying to cover all points of view.",1301616000,,2343,4.5738095238095235

2763984,5,B000NA6CQ8,"There have been a lot of great movies about incarceration, escape and people defying incredible odds to survive, and this excellent movie based upon true events and the book by Josef Martin Bauer rates among the best in my opinion.
I have not (as yet) read the book, and understand that the movie takes some liberties with the story. At face value this was probably essential to add some distraction to what would have otherwise been probably a slow plodding story.
This notwithstanding, I found the film to be tense, absorbing and emotional as you follow the character of Clemens Forell through his epic, and amazing journey.
The story is essentially straightforward, an enlisted soldier in the German army bids his daughter and wife (expecting their unborn child) farewell at a train station toward the end of World War II, heading for (one assumes) the Russian front.
The story moves quickly forward to his arrest and trial, and imprisonment and transfer by train to a Russian Gulag (along with many other German soldiers) for crimes against Mother Russia.
He arrives at Cape Dezhnev on the far eastern peninsula of the Asian continent by the Bering Sea, a forced labor camp to mine lead for the Russians.
If you want to get a flavor for his mammoth undertaking on foot, I urge you to map this location online.
The first half of the movie deals with this, and the brutality and inhuman conditions he and his fellow soldiers face under the guard of the base commander Kamenev, who tells him to forget all chances of ever leaving this wintry hell.
The second half of the movie deals with his escape, and 3 year 8,000 mile journey to try and reach Germany and home.
It is at times a little slow, but visually stunning, and emotional charged and tense throughout.
I read some reviews ask why the viewer should feel sorry for a German soldier after ""What they did to others in the War"" but would ask that you watch this, and see it for what it is. An enlisted man, taken from his family to fight for his country, perhaps blindly, but a million miles removed from the politics and atrocities of his superiors.
He could have been wearing a uniform of any nation.
Failing to feel for his plight and story for these reasons is a churlish take on humanity.

Although you may know how the story ends, it is no worse in the telling, and although the film is in German with subtitles, the movie contains minimal dialogue, and relies on a visual depth of storytelling.
Excellent performances all round, not least from Bernhard Bettermann as Forell, and Anatoliy Kotenyov as his relentless pursuer, this is a movie that shows the depth of the human spirit, and a love that drives a man to impossible ends.
Release in on an unrated Region 1 DVD.

1. Love affair with the tribal lady - This NEVER happened but they put it into the movie for some stupid reason. The whole motivation for him making this journey in the first place was to get back to his wife and kids.
2. The jew that ""saved"" him at the end - While he did receive a place to stay from a jew at one point towards the end of the book, he never provided any papers and as much help that the movie tries to push. There were never any moments where they discussed the holocaust as they did in the movie. You have to think about it and ask yourself; ""Why would a Wehrmacht POW know anything about the holocaust?"". Clearly the people that did the movie had an agenda and it's why they pushed the part about the jew, fabricating it to great extremes. It made my stomach turn to watch this part of the movie.
3. There was never any showdown between the Russian slave camp officer and Clemens as the movie tries to claim. This flat out NEVER happened in the book.

Basically, this movie is nowhere near the real story! I don't know why they decided to massacre what really happened but they did. They obviously had the rights to the story and could do whatever they wanted - and they did. Stay away from this garbage and read the book.
Too bad because I really enjoy Michael Mendl (Dr Stauffer) and Bernhard Bettermann (Clemens) as actors and find it difficult to believe they took part in this travesty.",1259280000,41,1683,4.25625

They totally made things up & some of these make the man look very, very horrible, in my opinion. A horrible injustice.

If you know or knew nothing of this story past what you have seen in this movie, please, go read the book that was approved by the man himself. Do not view history through the tainted eyes of this film at all.

As example: in this story of a man whose main purpose was to return home to his wife, his family, these film-makers have the audacity to throw in some totally farcical ""relationship"" he has along the way with some young, pretty native girl. Sick and disgusting and totally made up. Why make the man look like that type?

2763990,5,B000NA6CQ8,"This well executed film was based on the late-1950s work written about Clemens Forrell by Josef M. Bauer. The plot follows the plight of Clemens across thousands of miles of terrain - from his shipment by Soviet forces to a labor camp in Siberia following World War II, through to his eventual escape and return to his wife and daughter several years later. Unlike most films, the German in this piece is seen as the victim, even though he had been in alignment with the German political structure during the war. Up to this point, this reviewer has been engrossed in works about Germans who suffered following the war who had no connection with the German state (see my reviews for ""Bread on My Mother's Table: A Danube Swabian Remembers"" by Ingrid Andor, ""Barefoot in the Rubble"" by Elizabeth B. Walter, and ""A Terrible Revenge, Second Edition, Fully Revised and Updated: The Ethnic Cleansing of the East European Germans"" by Alfred-Maurice de Zayas). But this foreign film takes a different approach, viewing Forrell simply as a human being who was torn from his family, stripped of his dignity, and starved and worked to near death. The story has a happy ending, as Forrell's perseverance to escape his imprisonment is rewarded time and time again, including escape assistance provided to him by a German physician in the work camp, and later a Jewish civilian, in the most uncertain circumstances (and aided throughout his journey by the continued memory of his wife and child, with whom he desperately sought to be reunited). One of the most moving scenes in the movie shows Forrell bowing to say the Lord's Prayer. Some of the scenes are quite painful to watch, especially those showing torture, and the result of subzero temperatures on the human body. The scenes of Forrell travelling through the Siberian wilderness caused this reviewer to ponder the plight of the Donauschwabens in his own immediate family (descendants of Germans who had immigrated to an area that was later Yugoslavia, far removed from the political climate of the time who shared similar fates following the war due to their ethnicity), and as such the stoicism that helped many survive the post-World War II period was not present while watching this film. Be aware that this film is in German with English subtitles.

2763994,4,B000NA6CQ8,"I'm giving this movie 4 stars because I basically liked it. The positive aspects are an interesting story based on a true story, understandable German (good for students)and a likeable main character. Unfortunately there are a number of aspects that detract a bit from the potential of the movie. The first thing you notice is that there seem to be big gaps or jumps in the movie. It goes from the main character leaving for the war and jumps to him being a POW on a train with no indication of how when or where he was captured. Similar jumps take place frequently. Once the main character escapes from the prison camp, a strange years-long chase starts in which the prison commander pursues him across Russia. I ask myself how in the world one escaped prisoner could be so important as to be pursued for years and how the prison commander has the freedom to chase him halfway across the country. Many of the characters are not developed very well. A number of them seem to come into the story, take part for a while and then depart without being developed. There isn't much development of the survival aspect. After the initial scene when the main character escapes, there are big chronological and geographical jumps that gloss over all the difficulties one would find in trying to survive. Finally, the ending is a bit odd. The main character shows up at his own house almost like an unannounced stalker. However, in spite of all these little things, this is still an interesting story and an interesting movie. If you are looking for a good German movie that you might be able to understand as a non-native speaker, this isn't a bad choice either.",1241136000,,1652,4.6416382252559725
2763995,4,B000NA6CQ8,"This is film is based on a true story of a German soldier Clemens Forrell who is sent to the Russian front and taken captive at the end of the war.  He's sent to a labor camp where death seems much more appealing than staying alive.  What keeps him going is the memory of his wife and a promise he made to his daughter that he'd return.  He's able to escape with the help of a German doctor who has stashed away supplies and provisions for his own escape, but when he finds out he's got a cancer he knows he won't make it himself.  He also knows Clemens has the endurance, smarts and toughness to make the journey.  So he gives him the provisions, gun, clothes and everything he stashed away and sends him off on his way.  Clemans takes 3 years and 8000 miles before he makes it to Iran, only to end up in a prison there as a Russian spy.  Luckily he's rescued from there and able to return to Germany to his family who haven't given up hope.

Not that I'm a fan of Germany in WWII, but this movie makes you feel some empathy for the German POWs who were hauled off to Siberia to labor camps for the rest of their lives.  Their treatment by Russians is truly deplorable, which is hardly surprising.  First of all, the Germans were ruthless and brutal toward Russian civilians during their initial invasion of USSR.  Besides that the Russians did not treat their own people any better let alone show any respect for their captives.

It's a great story and I give it four stars. The thing that made me take a star off the rating is that it is a bit too melodramatic.  More than it needs to be in my opinion.  Specifically, I'm referring to the movie-long chase of the prisoner by the camp commander.  There is no way a prison camp commander would be allowed to travel across Russia to chase after an escaped prisoner.  A commander who had a prisoner escape on his watch would be careful not to report it in order to avoid repercussions.  He'd do a search for him for a while no doubt, given there were any tracks or any way to follow the escapee. But he would not worry about it beyond an initial unsuccessful search assuming the cold, hunger and wolfs would take care of the prisoner sooner or later.  After all, Siberia is a pretty vast country and pretty unforgiving too.  Chances of survival for a lone escapee who knows no local language, has no map or compass would be pretty minimal. Neither were the Russians in the late 40's sophisticated enough to have radios and communication systems in remote areas of the Siberia (native Siberian villages) to receive news about escaped prisoners.  Undoubtedly, these things were added to ""dramatize"" the story and keep the viewer on his toes, but it takes away from the authenticity.  I personally like real life stories told ""as they are"" without any embellishment.

2763999,5,B000NA6CQ8,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)

This is a German language film with English subtitles based on the novel by the same name which was based on a true story about a German POW in the aftermath of WWII who escaped a Siberia work camp and made an amazing 8,000-mile trek home to Munich to be reunited with his family.

I haven't read the novel, but of course it was a novel and so much of it was made up.  It doesn't matter however, since what counts in a movie is simply the movie itself.  I am always a little put off when the blurbs for a film scream out: ""Based on a true story!""  So what?  Sometimes that's significant and sometimes it isn't.  In this case the fact that there actually existed a German POW who managed such an amazing escape is important.  The exact details of what happened to him would be wonderful to have.  But in lieu of that, we do have this wonderful movie.

Bernhard Bettermann stars as Clemens Forell, and he is perfect for the part.  To survive such an epic adventure the person has to be strong of body and strong of will.  Bettermann looks as though he could actually do something like this, except for the fact that he is so tall and pale I suspect he would stand out and be easily identified as a foreigner in those strange lands through which he trekked.  Also a bit not so realistic is the Soviet camp commander who personally chases Forell all the way to the Iranian border (although that resulted in a nice ironic scene on the bridge at the border between Iran and what--I think--is Turkmenistan).  In reality there were probably several Soviet officers who played that part.  And I would also liked to have seen a little more about how he found enough to eat.  And finally it is clear that the last parts of his journey were sped up a bit as though the filmmakers were in a hurry.  But these are small quibbles.

I don't know if this ""coloration"" (as I will call it) was in the book, but what director Harvey Martins does is make the tall and ""Aryan"" Forell experience some of the same horrors that the Jews experienced.  In the beginning he is in a cattle car and nearly starved to death as he is taken to the Siberian lead mines.  He is in rags and nearly frozen and gets kicked around by sadistic soldiers.  If you saw just this part of the movie you would swear it was about the Jews being sent to a concentration camp.  In the camp after Forell is caught in an early escape attempt he is shown being beaten by his fellow soldiers, who of course, were punished because he tried to escape.  This was exactly the sort of thing the Nazis did in the occupied countries during WWII--if a single German was killed, that killing would be revenged many times over.  Later, one of the people who helped Forell is a Jew who lost relatives to the Nazis.  Nonetheless he helps Forell, and in doing so demonstrates not only a superior morality, but the kind of courage that is rare.  And why did he do it?  Because that is the kind of person he is, and that is the kind of persons we all should be.

While Forell is a positive, even a heroic figure, and a nice change for Germans who have to endlessly read about and see Germans portrayed in a most negative way throughout their whole lives, the movie itself tends to be neutral politically.

The scenes of the snow and the forests and the various places that Forell travels through are nicely done.  The ending is exquisite and brought me to tears.",1215561600,15,3549,4.3252647503782145

Two - having grown up in the USSR on horror stories of the World War II I find it extremely difficult to feel for the protagonist and his friends as their story pales in comparison to what my people went through in that war.",1478304000,,436,4.178571428571429
8176401,5,B000NA6CQ8,"It is not in English, but it doesn't matter.  This is a powerful movie with
a wonderful message about never giving up and not giving in to revenge.
Also, a really strong ending about 'letting hatred go' and thinking about
what is really important.",1466121600,,247,4.613636363636363
8176402,4,B000NA6CQ8,"Very good, mostly credible story of German POW in USSR during and after WWII, and his long escape across  Russia and beyond.  Ending was old fashioned good.",1461024000,,156,4.7407407407407405
