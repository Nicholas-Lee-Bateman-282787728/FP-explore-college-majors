8254241,4,B000NJ6FOI,"OK early 70's Mexican-made, Spanish-language (sub-titles available) El Santo crime adventure.  No monsters.  This time Santo is sort of a government agent after some organized crime type of criminals.  The best part of this whole fandango is the very beginning.  A sweet-singing singer (Jimmy Santy) warbles his heart out around rather beautiful Mexican scenics.  He is backed up by some bikini-clad beauties shaking their tail-feathers to his beat.  Along for this wobbly ride is Santo who mostly stands around.  At one point he slightly sways to the beat while standing at a fake ship's wheel.  All this before the credits.  The eyes goggle and the brain boggles.  That alone is worth getting the film.  The DVD is excellent quality.  Recommended for El Santo fans.",1443312000,,767,5.096774193548387
8254242,4,B000NJ6FOI,"When I bought the movie, I expected a lot of thrills.  I was completely right.  Since I discovered this explosive wrestler, he downrightly put Hulk Hogan to shame in many ways.  This is coming from someone who grew up on Hulkamania.  This foreign spy movie has a lot of Bond elements.  It is one of main reasons that I love it.  The 5'9 Hispanic wrestler seemed like over six feet tall with his strength, courage, and heart. Please check this movie out.",1320710400,5,453,4.463414634146342
