8143993,5,B000FP2RUQ,"This has been one DVD that I have been looking for, for about 3 years now. I recommend this for both new and die hard fans. This documentary goes through the entire history of Knotts Scary Farm. It runs a bit long, but it is so worth it. This is a must for any Halloween enthusiast. The special features go into further details and add more history to an already fact filled movie. I know its getting harder to find the DVD cause they stopped making them and I'm so very glad I got mine.",1353283200,2,487,4.136842105263158
