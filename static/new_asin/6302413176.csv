I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1512864000,,87,3.888888888888889

7825234,5,6302413176,"When researching our history of B we have left a trail of all genres including big to low budget and everything in between. However the true root of our love for B lies in only the poorest of films known to man. While searching for something of this caliber we stuck gold with an extremely unknown 1992 beauty called Armed for Action starring one of our favorite B pioneers; Uncle Joe Estevez. He captivated us in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Money-to-Burn-1996-VHS/dp/6303945457/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Money to Burn (1996) [VHS</a>] and left us speechless in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Werewolf/dp/6304737866/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Werewolf</a>&nbsp;but this may be his finest most hilarious attempt at acting yet. 1992 was one of those great years in life and so were the low budget B classic that came from the same wonderful decade.

Right off the bat you know where this one will stand by the opening music and<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked-Games-VHS/dp/B0006SSQRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked Games [VHS</a>] ending dream sequence. We follow a cop as he transports a mob hitman turned stool across country to stop for lunch in some Texas hick town. Here they meet a major town stud Jake, that wears his acid washed elastic waistband jeans up to his chest, and his buddy Alex that looks like Ronald McDonald. Together they must unite once Joe Estevez and some mafia guys try to capture the stool and finish him off. They attempt to recapture their town with plastic guns and a cardboard box of grenades. What doesn't make sense (well actually none of this movie made sense) is that Joe Estevez is a detective yet working with the mob without any explanation to why. In addition to the confusion of that aspect is the mafia guys themselves who are the biggest gang of Mary's ever seen. It looks like a bunch of accountants posing as mafia hitmen. Just one of the most hilarious things witnessed in a long time.

Armed for Action is an iconic B in the realm of what we used to always look for when choosing a movie. It easily had one of the lowest budgets yet to date along with the least amount of credited actors at a grand total of 11! Even Death Ring more then doubled that amount at 25, yeah Death Ring! Joe Estevez is someone very deserving of a lifetime achievement award for his 100+ resume of some of the worst films ever made. The guy can't step on a screen without bringing a cloud of B with him. We just have to thank the genius that found this movie and posted it on youtube allowing Sid to get it under his belt. If you have the chance and love poorly made laughable movies then this one should be your vehicle.",1267228800,2,2781,5.164079822616408
7825235,5,6302413176,"No movie has ever been as unintentionally funny as this one.  It is so poorly acted, written, and directed, I didn't stop laughing the whole way through. I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy B-grade kitsch movies. It is AWFUL..but funny as hell!",1040256000,2,251,4.704545454545454
7825236,5,6302413176,"If you want to laugh, cry, or maybe just enjoy a true work of amazing writing and acting then i have to suggest this fine film.  Armed for Action describes this movie exactly.  No better movie is available for the entertainment and price that this one has to offer.",1028678400,,265,4.387755102040816
