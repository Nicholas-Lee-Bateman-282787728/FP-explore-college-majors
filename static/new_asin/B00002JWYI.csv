A fun story about three roommates who head to Vegas in search of Mr. Right Now, and what they learn about themselves along the way.  I highly recommend it!",1000944000,6,295,4.214285714285714
1253871,4,B00002JWYI,"This was actually a movie I caught on cable half way through, and then I rented it. It was worth the rental fee!  This is a story of three single women all hoping and wishing to be married before they are old and gray.  Ileana Douglas is my fave in the movie, and the other women are charming  too.  a good cast, some interesting insights into marriage, relationships,  and sex. Also, good writing!  a very well rounded film, which was never  released widely.  catch it on video if you like romantic comedies with an  attractive cast.",950140800,11,534,4.479166666666667

7915790,5,B00002JWYI,"Wedding Bell Blues was released in 1996. Interesting to see Debbie Reynolds playing herself at her Las Vegas hotel. You get to see her act. It looked like when I saw her there in 1994. Also Stephanie Beacham in the mother role of one of the featured girls who look for Mr. right now. Pretty funny at times, a fine romantic comedy. Fans of the cast will like this the most.",1496534400,,372,4.253521126760563
7915791,2,B00002JWYI,"I really like the movie. I just had a problem with the DVD itself. It would play fine then it would have periods where there was no sound, almost like it had been muted. Then it would go back to being fine again. I couldn't finish watching the movie & I will be returning it.",1493078400,,275,4.0181818181818185

7915794,4,B00002JWYI,I love this movie but was somewhat disappointed with the quality. It was listed as very good quality by the seller but there was a 10 minute section that was completely unwatchable.,1466726400,,181,4.6875

7915797,3,B00002JWYI,"Wedding Bell Blues, from the late 90's, is about three singles ladies on the verge of becomming 30 who go to Vegas and plan to marry for one night, to break the 'stigma' of 'never being married.'

At the start, Micki is dumped by her boyfriend because he wants more passion in his live,'he want to ache'. Tanya gets some heat from her family for still being single and Jasmine has her own problems as well, with a fickle boyfriend who won't commit. Although Micki is a quiet girl they give her a 'blonde makeover' and she becomes the most out-going of the three.

The three head off to Vegas to find someone to marry for one night and then divorce the next day. Micki meets a hot cowboy and has her first real 'experience'. Jasmine marries an older man who is jilted by his ex-wife and Tanya marries a guy who seems to really like her. These three relationships play out over the course of a night and, suddently the next day, they leave, with Tanya's guy sadly looking after them over a balcony.

This is about two-thirds the way through the movie and it's quite interesting up to this point. But after they leave Vegas, things become a bit convoluted and I didn't really know what was going on. Jasmine is still on-again off-again with her boyfriend, Tanya's Vegas husband files for divorce before telling her he loves her, while Micki seems to come home late at night in a really good mood. But what was actually going on wasn't that clear. Overall I'd give it a 6 / 10, worth watching, for the most part enjoyable, but won't amaze you or anything.",1353888000,,1551,4.435087719298245
