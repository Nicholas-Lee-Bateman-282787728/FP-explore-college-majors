3445791,5,B001A5REB2,"""Tannhuser"" is a relatively clunky early opera from Richard Wagner (as he himself would probably tell you).  It is not as dramatically cohesive as his later masterworks (or even the opera that succeeded it, ""Lohengrin"") and the matter is not helped that the Paris version (which this DVD performance basically is), written about fifteen years after the original premier contains almost completely different music as Wagner had matured massively as a composer in that time (as he himself would probably tell you).  The experience is akin to watching an old sci-fi or fantasy movie (not naming any names) and seeing new special effects pop up out of nowhere every so often to rudely remind you that they were added later.  The effect *here* isn't rude however considering that the new music that Wagner wrote for this version - especially the Venusberg music - is soul meltingly *gorgeous*.

This performance from Bayreuth is gorgeous as well.  It's funny reading now how this production was considered controversial back when it debuted in the seventies.  Nowadays Wagner is almost unwatchable with all of the weirdo staging - I don't mind a little bit of interpretation with my opera (I'm not completely stodgy) but I don't want to see Valkyries in clown wigs and gas masks cavorting around nude spraying fire extinguishers into the audience in order to symbolize the apathy in our everyday lives, thank you.  Okay, except for the naked part.  Anyways, this production of ""Tannhuser"" isn't even that weird: it is still recognizable as being set in the middle ages (the costumes are semi-medieval mixed with some later period dress) and the locations are not out there at all.  The castle hall looks like a castle hall.  The Venusberg looks appropriately supernatural and unearthly.

The music itself is first rate.  Conductor Colin Davis is known more for his Mozart but that doesn't hurt here as ""Tannhuser"" is closer to ""Die Zauberflote"" than The Ring anyway.  He is brisk with his tempi and never lets the performance flag.  The singers are all great too.  Spas Wenkoff is an excellent Tannhuser, both good of voice and believable dramatically.  Bernd Weikl is likewise an excellent Wolfram, the guy that's in love with the girl that's in love with the bad-boy loser.  If you are male you can identify with this dude and have probably been him, unless you are the aforementioned bad-boy loser in which case hie thee to the Venusberg, baby.  The real star of the show though is Gwyneth Jones, taking a double turn as both Venus and Elizabeth.  I love Jones in this for two reasons: one is her dramatic commitment to the roles and the strength of her acting - if the lady had wanted to she could have been a theater or film actress had the opera thing not panned out.  The second is the outfit she wears as Venus in Act One.  In the immortal words of Wayne and Garth: schwing!  Oh, and she sings pretty too.

The picture on this DVD is good overall, although there is a lot of grain in the very beginning of the overture (the black levels are pretty bad).  The sound is excellent, with both stereo and DTS available for your listening pleasure.  This set comes with two discs and a booklet inside a double disc case.  Unfortunately there is nowhere to hold the booklet so it just sort of sits in between the discs (there is no flap or ""page"" for the second disc) which is extremely awkward.  Other than that this set is great.  I recommend it highly.",1355270400,6,3451,4.725752508361204
3445792,1,B001A5REB2,"The production is of variable quality.  Davis provides lackluster leadership.  Wenkoff if OK but sounds like a baritone with high notes.  Jones wobbles her way through both parts atrociously.  She can act as long as she's not singing.  I still cannot understand how this horrible voice maintains a career for a quarter of a century more, destroying more Wagner productions than I can count.  Recently Sirius Met broadcast a Gotterdammerung from the mid 90's with her and William Johns.  Easily, the worst Gotterdammerung I ever heard and probably the worst in Met history.  He sounded like Siegfried's grandfather and she like some barnyard or jungle animal imitating a dramatic soprano.

I remember her when she was a wonderful lyric-spinto soprano.  Her Desdemona with Barbirolli ranks with the best, her video of Elizabetta in Don Carlo IS the best.  But something horrible happened to her in the late 60's and early 70's.  Probably the desire to do the ""big roles"" pushed her voice into its depressing condition.  Her Ortrud on the Kubelik Lohengrin was one of the biggest operatic shocks of my life.  I don't think I've ever heard such a perpendicular drop in a former great voice...no youthful or appealing tonal quality remained and a grotesque wobble that grew to a point where it swallowed up any of her dramatic intentions.  And thus she remained...a grotesque caricature of an dramatic soprano for the next twenty five years.",1316131200,8,1436,5.0
3445793,5,B001A5REB2,"This staging seems to be very interesting in terms that despite being more of director's theater category,  it still shows how the proper way of interpretation of the major opera work should be done. The vision of director greatly suits the innermost idea of the work, abstractions made are of very creative type, the dramatic acting of the leading singers is fantastic, the costumes are of highest quality, with some reservations on stage design, which seems to be lacking the brilliance and is a bit too minimalistic, though not that inharmonious to distract the whole performance. The orchestra playing and singing are also remarkable and the video footage is also masterful. To conclude my review this is really a must have work for Wagner enthusiasts.",1286064000,3,756,5.048
3445794,5,B001A5REB2,"This DVD has a special meaning for me. It was my first Tannhauser! Those who are Opera buffs like myself (besides being a professinal singer too)know what I'm talking about. Gwyneth Jones is the best!!! Her Venus is sexy, voluptuous, vengefull, seductive etc, etc, etc. Her Elizabeth is the embodiment of youth, penitence, sacrifice and faith! Tenor Spass Wenkopf has a great Wagnerian Lyric voice that fits like a glove for the part. His caracterization of the unfortunate(?) LOL - ""hero"" is commited and matches the display of talent that Jones has. It's extremely difficult to find a tenor with a full package like that: musical, stage presence, and a wonderfull last ACT besides knowing how to sing OPERA and not this thing that the modern Theater directors and Stage Directors have been trying to do lately. I actually could not agree more with an article on Opera News about Dolora Zajick when she says that by doing that they are doing a ""disservice to the Opera as a Genre of music"" Opera has to be grand and its language requires that. Too much minimalization of gestures and action on stage make it not to work. Thus people get shocked with some of the absurd plots... Anyway... this is another story.
Back to Tannhauser... the staging direction makes everything focus on the singer having very little on stage (that's only good because  IT WORKS!)It makes highlight the talents of Jones, Wenkopf, Weikl, and Sotin. The supporting cast is great too! Cunductor Colin Davies lead the cast in a correct manner and does not compromise the piece. One would prefer a Solti or a Bohm but... Can't have everything.
Anyway, BUY IT! YOU WILL ENJOY!!!",1251763200,10,1650,4.809859154929577
3445795,5,B001A5REB2,"With four well written five-star reviews (which convinced me to buy this video) already posted, I didn't think it necessary to toss my chapeau into the ring. I am entirely in agreement about the greatness of this performance and its cast, conductor and director. But there seems to be a lot of confusion about the performing version in use here, since the booklet included says nothing on the matter. For detailed descriptions of the variants refer to the libretto of the Solti recording of the 1860 Paris version. These days, most performances use the Dresden version with some bits from the Paris revision, which mostly serves to make things un-needfully longer.

This performance begins with the Overture and Bacchanale from the Paris version, and, with the entry of Venus and Heinrich in scene two reverts to the original Dresden version of 1845 with the fairly minor emendations Wagner made to the beginning and end of the third act orchestrations for Vienna in 1875. There are two exceptions: the english horn solo for the shepherd's scene in act one is the longer version from Paris. And in the Act Two ensemble before the Landgraf's ""Ein furchtbares Verbrechen"" solo, there is a variant in the score which Wagner sanctioned after the premiere; for eight pages the male chorus and seven other soloists drop out so that Tannhaeuser sings alone. I believe this was to simplify a particularly difficult passage and to give the tenor another solo . I had only heard it done on the Sinopoli/Domingo recording, and a Bayreuth broadcast in the early 90's when the tenor canceled and was replaced on very short notice. I can't say I like it much.

Colin Davis make an excellent compromise and cuts the ensemble for only two of the eight pages. The transition is seamless and the re-entry of the ensemble makes better musical sense than Wagner's cut.

As to the nearly unknown Spas Wenkoff? I vividly remember staying home from work to hear and tape the 1976 Bayreuth broadcast of Tristan with Wenkoff and Ligendza under Carlos Kleiber's baton. It was, after seeing Vickers with Nilsson in '74, the most exciting Wagner experience of my life. Alas, my open reel deck only survived another few years, and that tape, along with some other treasures, dissolved into techno-oblivion.....Until last year when I discovered it as three free podcasts at Unnatural Acts of Opera. Go find it quick. Enjoy. There is also a Berlin Tannhauser under Suitner on the Gala label, and a Tristan on Bella Voce with Hans Vonk conducting Netherlands Radio with Roberta Knie. I sang a Die Walkuere 15 years ago with Roberta as production advisor (she spent about twenty summers at Bayreuth.) She said that she didn't enjoy working with him much, but he was surely exciting to watch. He had studied voice along with his brother, but became an attorney, and didn't perform outside Bulgaria until he was 45 years old! In or around 1980 he replaced Jon Vickers as Tristan at the MET, but got almost no mention (maybe a column inch) by the NY Times critic, who dwelt at length on Vickers' irreplacability. He dropped off the opera radar soon thereafter. I think you will agree after seeing this DVD or hearing the Tristan, that the loss was entirely ours.

If you love Wagner, buy this set. If you love opera, buy this set. If you love great theater and great singing, buy this set.",1250467200,13,3353,4.795847750865052
3445796,5,B001A5REB2,"Time to celebrate!  Finally this memorable production comes on DVD!  What made the folks at DG wait such a long time?  There were so many other sub-par DVD performances of this opera available out there long before this version was available.  This is perhaps the only version of the opera that I have seen where I have not been bored or just turned off by some director's ""vision"".  And boy does this opera need all the help it can get-which is exactly what happens here!  First is the production itself which successfully combines (mostly) the traditional directions of the composer with a good jolt of the modern perspective.  Of course nowadays this production would probably be seen as tame compared the the Munich production (w/ Rene Kollo and Waltraud Meier), although nowhere near as traditional as the Met's.  Second, this production would only succeed with strong, visually believable singers in the principal roles.  In Gwyneth Jones and Spas Wenkoff we have two such singers.  Yes, they are not exactly in the first flush of youth, but good grief, has any Wagnerian soprano displayed such physique as Dame Gwyneth (Venus) in her prime? Waltraud Meier (Venus) certainly matches her in Munich, but Dame Gwyneth goes one step further and performs the role of Elisabeth with even more distinction since it is vocally better suited to her.  Spas Wenkoff of course has to be mentioned since Tannhauser is such a murderous role.  He more than holds his own, and while his acting is respectable, the overall combination of vocal stamina and dramatic concentration makes him an interesting Tannhauser (how often can you say that about a Wagnerian tenor?).  Bernd Weikl and Hans Sotin lead the distinguished supporting cast while Colin Davis leads a reading of lyricism devoid of sentimentality and cheesiness.  The chorus is of course superb, and the videography is good for its age (1978).  Don't expect any HD-like visual quality.  Highly recommended.",1220745600,15,1956,5.027950310559007
3445797,5,B001A5REB2,"There are many videos of Bayreuth performances, but this was the first. For that reason alone, it's worth watching; fortunately it isn't the only reason.

Unlike later recordings, this one includes curtain calls. I think this was an excellent decision, since it evokes the thrill of being part of a Bayreuth audience. Only in Bayreuth will an audience remain absolutely silent until the last note has faded, and then erupt in a paroxism of emotion - good or bad. Listen carefully, and you'll hear the point where the audience begin to stamp their feet, causing the wooden structure of the Festspielhaus to resonate with a sound like thunder. They obviously liked this performance.

And why not, indeed; it's excellent.

Gwyneth Jones performs both Venus and Elizabeth, as Birgit Nilsson did, back in the sixties. There were some difficulties - her lower register wasn't quite up to the essentially mezzo part of Venus, and her diminutive stature meant that she had to stand on a box throughout act I (somewhat limiting her range of movement). That's her on the cover of the DVD - you can see the corner of the box if you look closely.  However, her acting ability, stage presence and total commitment to her roles more than compensated for these minor, er, shortcomings.

Spas Wenkoff's Tannhauser was full of manic glee (although this might have been a combination of close-ups and operatic acting). Wonderful strong voice, with none of the whiny edge that I've heard in other Tannhausers.

The unbelievably young Bernd Weikl was a splendid Wolfram - a role which he was to play many times. You might like to contrast his performance here with the one in the 1994 Munich performance, with Waltraud Myer as Venus.

The orchestra, chorus and other performers all lived up the normal Bayreuth standards of perfection. Colin Davis maintained a lively and expressive tempo.

This is the Dresden version (not the Paris version, as I said before), complete with a somewhat prim Bacchanale, filmed in 1978, when this originally controversial production had been accepted by the Bayreuth audience.

Technical issues? A few. After all, the film was made thirty years ago. The sound is almost perfect, but there are a couple of occasions where background noise intrudes. Thankfully they're brief. The image quality is somewhat variable, particularly in the darker passages. Again, this isn't obtrusive - I'm just being picky.

Strongly recommended.",1219449600,61,2438,5.057356608478803
3445798,5,B001A5REB2,"There is usually something special about a first recording, and this Tannhauser was the first complete opera video from Bayreuth, in 1978. It indeed is most compelling, graced by the elucidating and dramatic staging and direction of the highly acclaimed Gotz Friedrich. Ironically, for a first recording, Friedrich's original 1972 production raised holy hell in Bayreuth, booed in the house, criticized by politicians (!) and raising only medium levels of praise from the critics.

Today, it seems positively conservative. Banners than hang in the Act 2 song contest were criticized as too militaristic. Today they look positively traditional and inviting. When Tannhauser is about to sing his radical song, knights with swords lunge to attack him; hardly a stretch of imagination. The final chorus, on a darkened stage, was thought, incorrectly according to the set's notes, to be clad in a pedestrian outfit of red, apparently indicative of the East German Friedrich's Communist tendencies. Puhlease!

The Tannhauser is the unknown Spas Wenkel, a Bulgarian who was 50 when this was recorded. Apparently, from a Google search, he had a quick rise to acclaim and disappeared soon after. Here he joins the original cast from 1972 and they are a seasoned group. Wenkoff, besides possessing a very expressive stage presence, is a splendid singer, full of ardor with a ringing tone. His short career is our loss.

Gwyneth Jones tackles the roles of both Venus and Elisabeth, and portrays both superbly, in fine voice. Her Venus is not only vocally outstanding but a sight to behold, clad in a see-through outfit that does her and the audience, ahem, great justice. Yet, her dedicated Elisabeth, the flip side of Venus, is also spot on, full of reverence. Bernd Weikl, who made Wolfram a specialty, does the part superbly, bringing his refulgent baritone to excellent use. Venusburg is suitably (by today's standards) erotic. Maybe the Bayreuth regulars weren't used to this.

Colin Davis's conducting is outstanding. He has passion, drive, detail. A terrific achievement. It's as great a reading of this opera as I've heard.

Friedrich was renowned for his being an actor's director and getting the most out of his actor-singers, and Tannhauser is a terrific example, as are his live videos of Lohengrin (Peter Hofmann, Bayreuth, 1982), Meistersinger (Wolfgang Brendel, Deutsche Oper, Berlin, 1995), Manon Lescaut (Placido Domingo, Kiri Te Kanawa, Covent Garden, 1983) and films of Elektra (Leonie Rysanek, Karl Bohm, 1982) and Salome (Teresa Stratas, Karl Bohm, 1974).

I have see most of the Bayreuth productions on DVD and this is the only one I've seen that includes applause and curtain calls, a welcome addition. I've always felt less connected to an opera performance that lacks them, even though I realize that Bayreuth productions seem never to have been filmed live. Still, I like the illusion of an audience clapping and singers taking their bows. Sadly, it is done poorly here, with an obvious lack of coordination between the level of applause and the appearance of the singers, especially after Acts 2 and 3. Still, a nice touch.

The DG production is sharp, especially for its age, but too often plagued by bits of snow or white spots. DG could have done better. Overall, a magnificent performance.",1219363200,38,3309,5.139405204460966
3445799,5,B001A5REB2,"This is a recording of a live performance out of Bayreuth in 1978. Like most (though by no means all) Bayreuth audiences, this one is extraordinarily well-behaved, so coughs at inappropriate times aren't an issue and one gets all the benefits of a live performance without any of the drawbacks. There are curtain calls at the end of every act, but with the advent of the fast-forward button, these are not annoying.

As a warning, the production isn't strictly ""traditional"": Landgraf and the minnesingers are dressed in Faschist/Nazi style and the Venusberg is reimagined as a sort of opulent prison (Tannhauser looks through the strings of his harp during the overture as if they are prison bars.) Most of the time, though, the production makes sense: the minnesingers carry harps, the singing contest is in the grand hall of Wartburg, the Venusberg is underground and has its scantily clad nymphs, etc. Given what Wagner operas are turned into these days, this is as traditional a production as one is likely to get, unless one opts for the boring and generally poorly sung/acted Met version.

Now, to get to the *real* reason for buying this version: the cast. It's far superior to the Met's version and the other Bayreuth version in terms of both acting and singing. Bernd Weikl sounds and looks much fresher here (being 4 years younger than in the Met version) as Wolfram. If you don't like Gwyneth Jones, stay away: she plays both Venus and Elisabeth. I like her fine (though I don't love her), and though she tends to be a bit wild vocally her acting ability more than makes up for it. In the third act, she literally crawls across the stage and cries real tears during her prayer to the Virgin. When she goes offstage to die, you believe it. That said, I prefer the Met's Troyanos for Venus, because Jones' fach is not quite right for the part (I like my Venus a bit more mezzo-ish), and the Venus (can't remember her name) from the other Bayreuth Tannhauser was just plain bad. However, Jones stands head and shoulders above the Met's Eva Marton as Elisabeth (even if she can't match Cheryl Studer), and as Venus she doesn't give much to complain about, either.

And Tannhauser himself? Spas Wenkoff (who?) does a fantastic job. The role of Tannhauser is one well known for being a voice-killer, but Wenkoff manages not only to sing the notes but to inflect them properly for the drama. That his voice and appearance are more attractive than the Met's Richard Cassilly's are also major pluses. He's not a wonderful actor (too much weird, creepy smiling) but he's good enough to start out with and only gets better from Act One on. His Rome Narrative is Wagner candy, and his voice never shows any signs of tiring.

This a a very well-balanced production, which is why I think it works so well: the performers interact convincingly (unlike in the Met's), conducting by Colin Davis is sensitive (unlike Sinopoli's, whose major cut in Act 1 confuses me), and the singing standard is generally high--for the '70s, which were dark days for Wagner singing, the standard is very high indeed.

The technical details are as follows: There are subtitles in German, English, French, Spanish and Chinese, along with two options for audio: PCM Stereo and DTS 5.1 Surround sound, all of which can be accessed by the DVD menu. There is also a little booklet detailing the production's origins/interpretations.",1218758400,50,3404,4.792163543441227

3445803,5,B001A5REB2,"If you have to choose one DVD Tannhauser, this is the one. Colin Davis was not known as a Wagner conductor, but he leads a great reading, at turns reverential, erotic; certainly more suitable than the bombastic Solti. The production is dark but more than watchable. It may have been revolutionary at the time, but it's positively conservative now.

I don't know why there's confusion among other reviewers: the overture and baccanal are Paris 1861, the remainder is Dresden 1845 with a few adjustments. The role of Venus changed most from Dresden to Paris, going from soprano to mezzo with additional new 'Tristanesque' music. When the ballet is over, it's Dresden here, and Venus doesn't sing any Paris music.

Gwyneth Jones, who could be variable from one day to the next, is towering here. Her Venus is beautiful, erotic, yet frightening. Her Elizabeth is pure innocence. Her singing is bright and even, and she manages to make each role vocally different. Spas Wenkoff had a short career, but he is the best Tannhauser I've seen, with accurate unflagging singing. The bonus is to have great artists like Bernd Weikl, Hans Sotin, and Robert Schunk in smaller roles.

3445805,3,B001A5REB2,"Several earlier reviewers have stated this is the Dresden version. They are incorrect. You will be extremely disappointed, if you know the difference and are looking for Dresden.

I bought this because I wanted the Dresden version (which I prefer) on video, and because several reviewers stated (in typical authoritative, knowledgeable-reviewer style) that this was the Dresden version.  It soon became apparent, as the overture began swirling its way into the Venusberg music, that those particular reviewers didn't know what they were talking about.  (Update:  I notice the reviews have mostly been repaired, thank you :)

A brief primer for those who would like one. The Dresden overture begins and ends with the chorale called the Pilgrim's Chorus. The first notes or melody heard (in either version) is the Pilgrim's Chorus, played by horns. In the Dresden version, this chorale tune returns at the end of the overture, played by full orchestra with rousing counterpoint in the strings. In the later Paris version, the chorale does not make its reappearance, rather at that point the music starts modulating into a frenzied bacchanale known as the Venusberg music, the backdrop of an extended, usually erotic ballet.

The Venusberg music was written some 15 years after the opera's premiere and is noticeably in Wagner's later, more chromatic style. Some listeners prefer it for that advanced harmonic style. Others, including myself, think the contrast is bizarre, sort of like inserting a big chunk of Puccini into Donizetti. (That is an exaggeration of course, but not a huge one.)

There are a handful of other touchups Wagner made for the Paris version. They make up for a few bars here and there and do not call a great deal of attention to themselves.  They do not stand out like the Venusberg music, which is the main distinguishing feature of the Paris version.

Now, for Tannhauser, Bayreuth has historically played the Paris overture and Venusberg music, and then, for reasons I do not know, reverted back to the Dresden version for the remainder of the opera. And yet, this production does not totally follow that rule either.  For example, Venus physically appears at the end of Act 3, whereas in Dresden she is supposedly only heard off-stage. So it is slightly mongrelized (what opera performance nowadays is not slightly mongrelized??)  If one therefore wants to say this is not the TRUE Paris version either, I'm fine with that also (and I might respond, the TRUE Paris version had better be sung in French :)

So as far as I know, there are no Dresden Tannhausers on video, although there are several on disk (Konwitschny, and Gerdes, highly recommendable).  As for Paris Tannhausers ... I believe the Levine Met DVD is true blue Parisienne, as are the Domingo/Sinopoli, and Solti on CD.  (None in French, however :)  And anything from Bayreuth is going to be the mongrelized version, I believe.

Now as to this recording, disregarding the version, it was very enjoyable;  Gwyneth Jones was very touching in my opinion, there were no weak links in the singers.  Other than the ballet which I will get to shortly, I would have to say this a surprisingly traditional and enjoyable production of Tannhauser. The singing and orchestral playing are first-rate. The production was filmed rather than videotaped, which also brings out better color and detail.

I was quite turned off by the ballet and its setting.  First of all it looked like the old Fantastic Voyage movie set, with strings of gooey pink rubber.  And, it was just too over-the-top in gratuitous content.  If the undraped male posterior is what lights your fire, I'm sure you'll be delighted. Otherwise, be prepared for some pictures of an exhibition (and I don't mean Mussorgsky).

In short I am still awaiting a Dresden version on video, and in the meantime I would first recommend (before this) the traditional, full Paris version from Levine and the Met:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-Tannhauser-remastered/dp/B000EQHHK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner - Tannhauser (remastered)</a>.

I definitely did not look forward to anyone interpreting Der Ring Des Nibelungen trilogy because, try as anyone might, they will be insipid when compared with Solti. Tannhauser is one opera I wanted to try out Colin Davis and I was not disappointed. It was electrifying from the very first strains of the overture. Colin Davis has the definitive performance on record for Berlioz's Les Troyens and for Mozart's Die Zauberflote. No conductor has done a better job than him on these two operas. This is the Paris Version which was revised fifteen years after the Dresden original. The Venusberg music is soul stirring. Davis is superb in his reading. My personal favourite is Zubin Mehta and the Munchen Oper. When I saw it on the DVD, the Venusberg scenes look supernatural. The singers have also done a great job. Spas Wenkoff has done admirably as Tannhauser. He is dramatic and also has a good voice. Bernd Weikl is also an excellent Wolfram. Gwyneth Jones is the scene stealer as both Elizabeth and Venus.

From the first strains of the ""Pilgirm's Chorus"" to the end of the opera, the Christian note is definite--I was stunned at the finale to see how ""orthodox"" Wagner could be--if ""Parzifal"" made Nietzsche despair of Wagner's crypto-Christian sympathies, then this opera must have seemed impossible.

3445809,4,B001A5REB2,"First, the limitations: the sound was not at all good in Act 1, and it's hard to know how much to attribute to singers not yet warmed up and how much to engineers.  The ensemble in which Tannhauser is recognized by the Landgraf and his knights is sonically a mess, and that can't be the fault of the singers.  Fortunately the sound is much better in Acts 2 and 3.  It just has to be admitted, though, that the Cassilly/Marton/Levine (1983) and Versalle/Studer/Sinopoli (1989) are sonically much superior, and are both honorable efforts at this difficult opera.  It also has to be said that in none of these recordings is the singing of the major roles without some problems, but in the nature of things, that's almost inevitable with ""Tannhauser.""  In this recording, Gwyneth Jones sounds much better as Elisabeth than as Venus, and Wenkoff, the Tannhauser, while firmer and heavier of voice than Cassilly or Versalles, lacks lustre and ease.  Bernd Weikl is good as Wolfram, but even he has his rough moments.  The loveliest bit of singing as singing comes from Robert Schunk as Walther von der Vogelweide in Act 2.  The late Sir Colin Davis's pacing is fine, but the recording doesn't do full justice to the orchestral richness.

But all these reservations are put in the shade by the power of the acting, the imaginativeness of the production, and the generally very effective video direction.  The singers are fully committed here, and the intensity is palpable.  Given that the singing, while not perfect, is certainly good, you have the makings of a memorable production.  The better-sounding Levine and Sinopoli versions are static by comparison, though Cassilly's final scene is intense and moving.  The outstanding performance in the recording under review is that of Gwyneth Jones -- her acting is detailed, specific, and powerful by movie standards, let alone opera.  As Venus, she looks sexy and scary as hell, and as Elisabeth she catches the sexual responsiveness to Tannhauser's advances (physical and musical), and also the full horror of her recoil from them -- horror because on some level she knows that it's wrong to respond as the other minstrels have done -- they seem all to be incipient Klingsors, hating the body and any acknowledgement that love might be anything other than Platonic!  The whole of Act 2 is a triumph, and Jones's acting as the self-starving, self-hating Elisabeth in Act 3 is so powerful that Wolfram's Evening Star song seems an inadequate response to her plight, that of a nice guy who is out of his depth with the complicated emotions roiling Elisabeth.

Spas Wenkoff brings intensity to Tannhauser too, though it doesn't seem to come quite as naturally to him as to Jones, but his work in Acts 2 and 3 is very fine.  Gotz Friedrich has a fine conception of the opera, with a Venusberg that catches from the get-go the moral and spiritual desolation of the place.  Gotz Friedrich's triumph in this production, though, is to get us to realize that Wartburg is no less morally and spiritually desolate, as Jones's performance as both Elizabeth and Venus in Act 3 makes clear.  Where Troyanos (for Levine) is too maternal and Sinopoli's Venus too kittenish, Jones has power and she exerts that power and knows that her ""relationship"" with Tannhauser is all about power.  She's scary in Act 1 and even scarier in Act 3, and it doesn't hurt dramatic credibility that she's a terrifically sexy woman.  Bottom line -- whatever other Tannhausers you have, get this one too and don't worry too much about the sound: it gets better as it goes on, and the ear adjusts.",1366848000,7,3604,4.827642276422765

marred by bad cinematography. How can you video a bacchanal with continuous close-ups? You have no idea about the choreography at all. And the sound is not exactly very clear. The staging is bare and very dark. Disappointing.",1524700800,,367,4.75

The now familiar device of casting one artist as both Venus and Elizabeth is used -- and with a singer of Gwyneth Jones's stature -- why not?  If there has ever been a better Wolfram than Bernd Weikel, I don't know who that would be.  Even the leaden and  interminable Rome narrative captures one's attention.  And the Venusburg ballet is enough to melt your dentures.",1471132800,,493,4.682352941176471
8276225,5,B001A5REB2,"This was the first complete opera filmed in the Festspielhaus (some faulty lip-synch and the proliferation of camera angles betrays the bits-and-pieces approach to shooting) and it still stands out among video presentations of ""Tannhauser."" Gotz Friedrich conceived of a repressed world in which Venus is the carnal side of Elisabeth, whom Tannhauser cannot even bring himself to touch, and the Landgraf's court is clearly enraged that Tannhauser has done what they dare not -- sampled the delights of the Venusberg. John Neumeier's ballet depicts the latter as a whirlwind of stylized copulation and spiderweb-like garb. Venus is almost motionless -- shades of Wieland Wagner's 1961 production -- while Tannhauser abases himself at her feet. (She makes her final appearance wearing a death mask.) The edition, by the way, is the Bayreuth-favored conflation of Dresden with the Paris ballet.

Doubling Elisabeth and Venus, the adversaries for Tannhauser's soul, Gwyneth Jones must take pride of place. Her involvement is always 110% and she is in splendid voice, despite the marathon demands of her assignment. Jones' Act III penance is operatic acting taken to a place that is so real one is almost abashed to watch it. She has a suitable Tannhauser in Spas Wenkoff: sturdy, dark-toned, tireless and a feverishly intense actor. Indeed, everyone in this staging seems fired by a sense of purpose, for instance, Bernd Weikl in the first of three video preservations of his Wolfram von Eschenbach. Anyone preferring this to his later interpretations will get no argument from this quarter. Hans Sotin is fearsomely authoritative Landgraf (what a sonorous voice!) and Franz Mazura's proto-fascist Biterolf stands out amongst the minnesingers. Top marks, too, to the Tolz Boys Choir soloist who plays the Shepherd in Act I and returns for an unscripted cameo in Act III. Even though the Dresden edition of the score is employed, one not lament any loss of Wagnerian richness, as Sir Colin Davis plumbs the score for one treasure after another, all the while keeping a sense of momentum. Do not pass ""Go,"" do not collect $200, just get this eloquent exposition of Wagner's first masterpiece.",1450742400,2,2186,5.192634560906516
8276226,4,B001A5REB2,"I have been watching this video on YouTube, and I agree with the positive assessments posted here.  Two good points the reviewers seem to omit: the camerawork is excellent, with many closeups on the singers' faces which allow the viewer to observe, and learn from, their technique; also, the reviewers here are almost all omitting to appropriately praise the imposing, golden-voiced basso Hans Sotin, whose masterful technique and understated performance are far and away (IMHO) the best thing about this performance.

One other singer deserves special mention, although his part is small: up-and-coming superstar character-baritone Franz Mazura, who plays Biterolf, and would later distinguish himself as Alberich and as Gunther and as Klingsor and as Dr. Schn.

This would be a five-star performance if not for Jones' occasional grittiness of tone and deviation from correct pitch.",1442707200,,883,5.477941176470588
