2959364,2,B000W07EL6,"A not very scary Omen rip-off. Tons of loose ends. The only redeeming feature is getting to look at Josh Holloway of ""Lost."" Get somebody else to rent it for you. Best when viewed through beer goggles.",1203120000,,201,4.45945945945946
2959365,4,B000W07EL6,"If you know the SciFi channel, you know of some of the horrible, B-rated, terribly acted, bad CGI feature films that they love to show. However this one was one of the better ones. They relied more on plot than fake gore to achieve the creepy mood of the film. Far from the best horror film I have ever seen, but not the worse by any stretch. Not bad at all when bored on a Wednesday night. Give it a try.",1202947200,,405,4.012345679012346
2959366,2,B000W07EL6,"Wasn't too impressed by this movie.  It was almost boring.  A woman adopts a child who turns out to be the devil; the little boy gets kidnapped for a ransom, but when the kidnappers start dying off the head kidnapper decides the boy should be killed.  Turns out, the kidnapper wanted the boy killed anyway.

It's called ""Whisper"" because the devil in the little boy whispers to people, compelling them to do crazy things.  The movie is quite boring up until it's climax.  The climax was great, the storyline twist took me by complete suprise.  I can usually figure a story out before it's climax but this twist kind of rocked me....and then it got boring again.  In fact the ending was ridiculous!!

I'm glad I saw this on tv.  I wouldn't even rent this let alone buy.  As someone else has said it's just a really good Omen knock-off; however,the Omen movie's are much better.",1201392000,2,876,4.551282051282051
2959367,1,B000W07EL6,"The movie moved along slowly with a fairly predictable plot.  The boy slowly turns the kidnappers against each other.

There were few special effects and not the graphic scenes one might expect from a ""horror"" film.",1200614400,3,215,4.944444444444445
2959368,4,B000W07EL6,"I'm not sure who wrote the blurb on the DVD box which described this movie as a tale of ""Bone chilling terror"" but all I can say in reply is that the writer must be very easily scared and should probably stick to Disney movies. The movie isn't scary at all and it lumps together any number of tried and tested horror movie cliches such as an out of season summer camp, a spooky kid and a lone girl chased through the woods. There are moments which bring to mind other horror movies, such as The Shining, Damien: Omen II & The Blaire Witch Project, all of which may have influenced the director. However despite these short comings the movie worked, at least for me it did. It was entertaining, well acted, well cast and although many of the themes have been used before the movie as a whole was sufficiently different to hold the attention and the ending came as a total surprise. Michael Rooker and Josh Holloway played their parts well and with conviction but newcomer Blake Woodruff as the boy, David, was perfectly cast and played the part with relish and surprising maturity for one so young. In short an entertaining movie that I'd happily recommend but if you're looking for something to scare your socks off look elsewhere.",1200182400,17,1231,4.54954954954955
2959369,3,B000W07EL6,"In this terror film, the most inept band of kidnappers in world history abducts the child from hell, an eight year old adopted boy from a very wealthy family in New England, who's in fact the antichrist or something. One by one, the kidnappers will pay for their deed. The film looks like an unauthorized knock off of The Omen, and while mildly entertaining, is hardly a great film. Made with a no name cast (except perhaps for Michael Rooker, who twenty years ago has a cult hit in Henry, Portrait of a serial killer) the good scenery from New England in winter and a good hand in the directing adds a little to this passable movie. Just don't take it too seriously.",1197158400,12,667,4.430894308943089

2959392,5,B000W07EL6,"I was surprised that this movie did not get more five star reviews. The script could of been written better. Casting Blake Woodruff as David was brilliant. He added some scintillation to his character. I thought the rest of the supporting cast was average. One of the best lines that Blake Woodruff said was when Santa asked him what he wanted. His reply was, ""What do you want Santa."" David played one kidnapper against the other killing off nearly all the kidnappers. Blake's character David was a mixture of sweet and devious. I think this is a great movie if you don't mind watching some killings.",1507507200,,601,4.679245283018868
2959393,3,B000W07EL6,"3 stars, because this is just o.k.  I found it funny that the two leads were Josh Holloway and Sarah Wayne Callies who are teamed up again for the tv show ""The Colony"". I guess people like seeing these two together. Anyway, the acting is fine, but others are right in their reviews comparing this to ""The Omen"". The story is not the same, but it's like the lost chapter where Damien was kidnapped as a child. And speaking of the child in this, I really didn't like him. Now, I know that we aren't supposed to like his character in this, but he just annoyed me regardless. I'm a horror fanatic, and most of my reviews are for these movies. This one just didn't do it for me. It was just an average film that wasn't quite scary enough, and I got a little bored from it. It's not terrible though, and some of you might like it if it's free on Prime. Guide=some foul language, no nudity and some minor gore",1504396800,,902,4.213872832369942

2959413,5,B000W07EL6,"A very different ""horror"" story, more a diabolical Home Alone combined with The Omen.

Unable to get a loan to open a diner, an ex-con lets a friend convince him into a kidnapping. He and the others soon discover their victim isn't what he appears to be and disaster follows.

This movie is filled with familiar faces, even if the audience won't be able to put names to a good many of them.  It seems a great many TV series participants are represented, with Josh Holloway from Lost leading the way.  Blake Underwood, as 8-year-old David, is a fantastic little actor, handling the adult dialogue the kidnap ""victim"" delivers with just the proper menace and unnerving stares. It'll be interesting to see what this youngster does if he continues as a actor after becoming an adult, for his portrayal of David is restrained and eerie.

No mention is made of why David is the way he is or exactly what he is, though there is a climactic scene toward the end of the movie in which it's disclosed he's already killed his father and nanny.  A little background would've been good though it wouldn't necessary do anything for the story other than giving some explanation to the audience. One might also wonder about the odd appearance of the ""wolves,"" if such they are (whoever saw a black wolf with white markings?) , but there again, clarification isn't really necessary in the general scheme of things.

There are a few shock moments, making one jump, and more than enough psychological ones as when Roxanne is trapped in a shower with a wolf sniffing outside the open bathroom door. Other scenes are foregone conclusions, however, and one can see them coming as per cliches...frozen lake, walking on it causes ice to crack, take it from there.

All in all, an expected good shocker of a psychological drama.

It was smart with a pretty good story and decent, believable acting. All in all I would say it is a solid 4 star movie for the genre.

2959459,4,B000W07EL6,"I chose this rating simply because I was a step ahead of the story all the way through. Otherwise I'd have given it a 5  It's a good one, none the less.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat to see how the demon manipulates the things that happen.
Blake Woodruff is a good little actor, just hope this doesn't type cast him to always act in horror shows. He's too good for that.
Of course Josh Holloway is complete eye-candy for the ladies but macho enough for the guys.  Sarah Wayne Callies can keep the guys interested while we're looking at Josh.
The acting is pretty good and the spooky old lodge I was sure was going to fall down on them all!  Good shooting site.",1395273600,,666,4.1796875

2959463,2,B000W07EL6,"Another anti-christ child story with bland characters, sluggish pacing and a completely predictable twist at the end.  The gimmick with this particular story is that the child has been kidnapped and then proceeds to torture his kidnappers.  Through the whole film, I never got the sense that there was any real conflict.  The child is simply all powerful, knows everything and can do anything.  The kidnappers are desperate, baffoonish and easily corruptible.  Whisper has all the entertainment value of watching someone shoot fish in a barrel with a bazooka.  The last 5 minutes or so take a turn that makes no sense, and left me feeling completely unsatisfied.  If you're a fan of horror movies, you should know that this flick has not one second of dread, fear, suspense or even a startle.  There are plenty of other movies far more deserving of your time and money.",1392595200,,869,4.863945578231292
2959464,4,B000W07EL6,"I was just thinking about Josh Holloway and what he's up to these days and flashed back to this movie. And then, whaddaya know, suddenly it is suggested to me by Amazon!

This movie is great fun and the spoiler in the reviews are going to kill it for you. The fun was all in the discovery of what the deal was with the boy (not going to spoil it, just in case you missed the hundreds of other people's reviews that do- even right in the title). Inconsiderate much?

Once again, I am forced to take issue with people's weak thinking/analysis that stops immediately after the first strong association (this movie is a ____ rip off/version/etc.) Uh... the horror genre is full of recycled thematic content. So what? There hasn't been a truly original idea since maybe Shakespeare's era, but I'm sure scholars would be able to  tie those back to Ancient Greek and Roman philosophy and art. Its time to get over this. The issue is not 'is an idea novel?' but 'how is that idea translated into film (or fill in the medium blank)? Does it work? Is it effective?

What I recall about this film is that it was a fun ride. I enjoyed ""Sawyer"" (my fave character) on LOST, so I was excited to see JH in something else. I liked his character here as well, and I thought the drama surrounding the kidnapping, the relationship conflict that emerged, generated good tension for most of the ride, and to set up the end. 3/4 of the film is that. The big reveal happens toward the end and that was surely entertaining.  Hell, I think I'll watch this one again. Tho, to be fair to my other 4s, I'd have to say this one is more of a 3.5 on my meter. This one's fun, but its not one I'd necessarily add to my collection. So adjust your expectations. That always helps when going into a movie.",1392508800,,1770,4.335347432024169

(David) who played the young boy, was once an angel, but soon became evil,he whispered tempted evil acts, in the ear of his victims in order to kill. This was no angel; nor was David fighting between good or evil he was evil. During most of the movie he persuades and conveniences you to either kill or choose to die; by his hand in a sense.

2959488,2,B000W07EL6,"I chose this little known film for two reasons. First, for a B-Movie, the cast is terrific! Second, the best horror films are the ones with evil, sadistic, kids. What's scarier than a kid who goes around killing people? In Whisper, David is a kid of fortune, but very introverted. At his birthday party, he's kidnapped and held from ransom, but he's not really the prisoner, they are! I tried to like this movie, but honestly I didn't. The cast was excellent, but the film moves very slowly, very little actually happens, and when it does, you already knew it was coming. It wasn't an awful movie, and this cast is certainly appealing, but something just doesn't click. I'd avoid this one if I were you.",1361577600,,703,4.587301587301587
2959489,4,B000W07EL6,"This is very honest B-movie, which clearly borrowed a lot from ""Omen"" (a much better film), but is definitely more than just a pale copy of this already legendary pillar of horror cinema.

""Whisper"" is the story of 8-years old David Sandborn and four people who kidnapped him for ransom. The leader of the four is an aging bank robber Sidney (Michael Rooker), a dangerous criminal who spend half of his life in jail and who has blood on his hands. His wingmen, thieves Max (Josh Holloway) and Vince (Joel Edgerton) are younger and less dangerous, but they are also career criminals. Max girlfriend Roxanne (Sarah Wayne Callies) was co-opted to take care of the kidnapped child.

Well, as it is signaled on the back cover of the DVD, pretty soon it will become clear, that David is not an ordinary child - and in fact it is not him who is in danger, but the people who abducted him... I will not say more here to avoid spoilers.

The scenario is not bad at all and almost of the film makes for a nice watch. The ending could be a little bit better, but it is not half as bad in most of horror films. The one big hole in the plot is the abysmal idiocy of a policeman who drives to a distant and isolated location without any backup and without even signalling where he is going - but I have seen much worse in B-movies (and not only B-movies)...

All actors performed well, but it was the young Blake Woodruf (he was 12 at that time) who plays David who really impressed me, because unlike Damian in ""Omen"", David speaks a lot and well. And if this young actor can play something else as well as in this film, well, he has a great future before him... Another strong point in the cast is Sarah Wayne Callies, a very beautiful woman but also clearly a very good actress.

I liked this film and I think I will keep the DVD for a rewatch one day. Recommended for all horror amateurs. Enjoy!",1354752000,,1885,4.313559322033898

2959511,4,B000W07EL6,"Whisper is a definite sleeper movie that will have you wondering while watching just what the heck you've gotten yourself into.  An 8-year old boy steals the show in this thrilling supernatural horror. Don't read any detailed reviews, don't even read the back of the cover for a synopsis.  Simply get the movie and settle in for a suspenseful tale full of wonderful twists and turns.  Great story, better than average acting and a damned smart kid sporting a preppy sweater-vest over a crisp white shirt buttoned to the hilt. And You know what that means.

If you know your horror, you'll sense the signs of evil lurking at every turn as you savor the tension. If you're not a horror movie buff, the soundeffects alone might cause you to jump out of your skin. But do watch, there's little if any blood splatter and no flesh eating zombies.

The man, Max, and his 'associates' think this plan is straightforward and foolproof. They sure have a lot to learn. This film is definitely not your typical 'formula' Adventure/Horror film. The various plot twists keep the film one step ahead of the viewer. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time wondering what was going to happen next. The young director, Stewart Hendler, does an excellent job with this movie. He has a clear vision of where he wants the story to go. Josh Holloway gives a very strong performance, and young Blake Woodruff plays his character to perfection. (I think this kid has a great future in acting.) If you are hesitant to watch this movie because you think it is just a ripoff of every other horror film you've seen, then you will be missing out on something spectacular. I would call this film unique, creative and definitely thought provoking. I'm glad this film is on DVD. It is a treasure among films.",1300320000,3,1077,4.556701030927835

I see people comparing this to the Omen, but the only similarity is that there is a boy involved. The story is nothing like the Omen and slowly works its way to a surprise ending. The story really centered around an abduction and ransom for money.  The horror end of it is revealed over time as it becomes apparent that the boy is something more than the average kid. I thought it was very creative.  As far as similarities to other horror movies, there are only so many settings one can create. It is easy to compare this with many movies but I did not find it cliche' in any way. It was quite unique since it was an area that hasn't been covered exactly in this way. The boy was not represented to be the ""devil"" but something else. If you like religio/horror types of movies you will like this one.

2959518,4,B000W07EL6,"My father and I bought this mainly because it has Dule Hill in it and we wanted to see what he would be like outside of Psych.  Well we got more than we bargained for--the movie also has Josh Holloway ('Sawyer' from Lost), Teryl Rothery (from Stargate SG1) and John Kapelos ('Skanky' from Forever Knight) running around in it.

What was the most entertaining in this film was the little boy, David wasn't just creepy, but unintentionally funny as well.  The young actor really sold the 'demon spawn' act.  Even when he was acting 'innocent' he had this underlying evil intent behind his words that made my skin crawl.  Also, the little smile of triumph each time something bad would happen, was downright chilling.

As far as a story goes we have Max and his fiancee agreeing to kidnap a rich little kid in order to make some easy cash to start their new lives.  Max calls in two associates from his days before he went behind bars--both of whom I wouldn't have trusted with a pencil let alone a kid--and the foursome gets the kid.  It shouldn't be hard to guess who began the kidnapping plot, but some confusing things happen.  Along the way they pass by a tow truck driver and we see flashes of him committing a violent act.  Later they pass by a couple engaging in some fun in the back of the guy's truck and again we see some violent acts.  At first my dad and I weren't certain if David was psychic and he saw these people committing these crimes in the future or what was going on.

That was cleared up pretty quickly.  David is a mind-screw in the highest order.  He manipulates, connives, and seduces with his words and insinuations.  As the movie unfolds the foursome begins to splinter and one by one bad things begin to happen.  Dule Hill plays a newbie detective while John Kapelos plays his commanding officer.  Really their parts are small and inconsequential--just kind of there for when we need to remember this is a kidnapping plot.

The movie moves at a slow pace, almost crawling really, as it sets up that a) Max and his fiancee are not BAD people, just people that do bad things, b) David is the creepiest kid this side of the grave and c) don't grow attached to anyone.  It starts to pick up speed when one of the first kidnappers is dealt with, but it has such dragging moments it can be a chore.  I often found myself really not caring for the fiancee and wondering why she was brought along.  Between doing stupid things (like showing David her face), nagging Max about just letting David go (I think she wanted to go to prison. I really do) and protecting David despite the really bad feelings she was having, I wanted her gone.

The DVD comes with an alternate ending, deleted scenes (which fleshes out some of the 'how the heck did you know THAT?' moments in the film) and extended scenes (none of which are particularly interesting).  There's also a making of featurette, which is cool if you like that sort of thing but nothing spectacular.

Overall this was a much better movie than my dad and I thought originally thought it would be.  As compared to The Omen, I think David is heck of a lot more resourceful and competent.  He gets the job done and then some (what he does to mess with Max's head at the very end is just...yow).",1278201600,,3261,4.447811447811448
2959519,5,B000W07EL6,"I rented this movie from Netflix without knowing anything about it. Yet, I had seen a preview and that whetted my appetite and when I got it, I wasn't expecting much.

Wow, was I wrong!

This wonderfully made chiller is brilliantly done in every category. It looks great and its backdrop of a snow-covered landscape and shadowy old house is a perfect setting as a demon child turns the table on his kidnappers in the worst way possble.

Director Stewart Hendler and writer Christopher Borrelli are to be applauded for trying to do something fresh with the ""Demon Child"" genre--and they more than succeed.  The grisly deaths are innovative and chilling.

But much of the credit for the triumph of this exercise in terror goes to the outstanding cast who give it their all.  Newcomer Blake Woodruff as the creepy, unnerving child monster deserves top accolades and he's matched all the way by handsome, troubled Josh Holloway as the reluctant villian who somehow makes his character vulnerable and tragic. Michael Rooker turns in his usual excellent take on a human monster along with Australian thespian Joel Edgerton.

The best death sequence--and I'll try not to give anything away--takes place on the frozen lake. It's a masterpiece of acting, editing and terror.

I've long got sick of the ""devil child"" genre, thanks to the never-ending stream of Asian horror flicks and their remakes where we're supposed to be terrified by Asian children covered in white make-up, black mascara with their mmouths contorted into a growl.

""Whisper"" does away with all those worn-out devices and you won't soon forget little ""David"" in this memorable chiller by a cast and crew of true artists at the top of their game.",1272240000,,1707,4.919860627177701

2959521,5,B000W07EL6,"Skillfully made horror flick distinguished from its genre companions primarily by Dean Cundey's superb cinematography. Some memorable and powerful overhead shots of Maine. One shot was almost a still with only images of cars moving, very affecting.

Clever touches throughout in the direction. For example, there is a match cut from three cards on the wall, two of them clubs, to blinds with with clover silhouettes.

Very good scoring through much of the film, although the score and the sound design falls off substantially in the last hour, where there is much too much stock foley effects and also stock creepy horror music. But the ""Carol of the Bells"" montage is spectacular, and the Cash ""Ring of Fire"" very apt.

Acting is quite good throughout. Plot somewhat marred by the ""lone cop syndrome"" that so many movies rely on, and an ending perhaps a bit long with some cliched expects, but here again, it was really the sound design and the score that marred it.

Overall, though, a deft film.

As to the DVD, transfer was good quality. Deleted scenes (usually overrated) were not entirely useless here. Some reasonable background on the cop, for example. Making of feature was interesting and frankly surprising in many respects (for instance, that a child stunt double hanging 40-feet above the ground doing acrobatics was used for some of the stunts), although it was missing a description of how they got all those aerial shots (CG? helicopter? some kind of remote dolly?), and not much on the lighting.",1261699200,,1512,4.937007874015748

It doesn't have graphic violence, gore, sexual scenes and nudity, and for the most part is campy by comparison of many other horror movies. However at the same time I will say i love it, if for nothing else the psychological suspense it offers the viewer.
The movie starts off staright forward enough, four kidnappers, two of which don't seem to be that bad as people go, get the idea to kidnap a rich kid. Problem is they have serious judgment issues with the kid they choose to kidnap, and I mean serious. Throughout the movie this kid is more calm and calculating tha Hannibal in either the 'Silence of the Lambs' or its sequels. Without practically raising a finger he manages to get into each of their heads and drive them to their deaths in truly maniacal ways.
Personally as far as suspense thrillers go I give it two thumbs up, too bad Stephen King didn't think this one up, because it fits his style to the letter, but don;t take my word for it, see for yourselves.",1206230400,,1082,4.415

There are moments which bring to mind other horror movies, such as The Shining, Damien: Omen II & The Blaire Witch Project, all of which may have influenced the director. However despite these short comings the movie worked, at least for me it did. It was entertaining, well acted, well cast and although many of the themes have been used before the movie as a whole was sufficiently different to hold the attention and the ending came as a total surprise.

3193910,5,B000W07EL6,"A very different ""horror"" story, more a diabolical Home Alone combined with The Omen.

Unable to get a loan to open a diner, an ex-con lets a friend convince him into a kidnapping. He and the others soon discover their victim isn't what he appears to be and disaster follows.

This movie is filled with familiar faces, even if the audience won't be able to put names to a good many of them.  It seems a great many TV series participants are represented, with Josh Holloway from Lost leading the way.  Blake Underwood, as 8-year-old David, is a fantastic little actor, handling the adult dialogue the kidnap ""victim"" delivers with just the proper menace and unnerving stares. It'll be interesting to see what this youngster does if he continues as a actor after becoming an adult, for his portrayal of David is restrained and eerie.

No mention is made of why David is the way he is or exactly what he is, though there is a climactic scene toward the end of the movie in which it's disclosed he's already killed his father and nanny.  A little background would've been good though it wouldn't necessary do anything for the story other than giving some explanation to the audience. One might also wonder about the odd appearance of the ""wolves,"" if such they are (whoever saw a black wolf with white markings?) , but there again, clarification isn't really necessary in the general scheme of things.

There are a few shock moments, making one jump, and more than enough psychological ones as when Roxanne is trapped in a shower with a wolf sniffing outside the open bathroom door. Other scenes are foregone conclusions, however, and one can see them coming as per cliches...frozen lake, walking on it causes ice to crack, take it from there.

All in all, an expected good shocker of a psychological drama.

Through the whole film, I never got the sense that there was any real conflict.  The child is simply all powerful, knows everything and can do anything.  The kidnappers are desperate, baffoonish and easily corruptible.  Whisper has all the entertainment value of watching someone shoot fish in a barrel with a bazooka.  The last 5 minutes or so take a turn that makes no sense, and left me feeling completely unsatisfied.

3193961,4,B000W07EL6,"I was just thinking about Josh Holloway and what he's up to these days and flashed back to this movie. And then, whaddaya know, suddenly it is suggested to me by Amazon!

This movie is great fun and the spoiler in the reviews are going to kill it for you. The fun was all in the discovery of what the deal was with the boy (not going to spoil it, just in case you missed the hundreds of other people's reviews that do- even right in the title). Inconsiderate much?

Once again, I am forced to take issue with people's weak thinking/analysis that stops immediately after the first strong association (this movie is a ____ rip off/version/etc.) Uh... the horror genre is full of recycled thematic content. So what? There hasn't been a truly original idea since maybe Shakespeare's era, but I'm sure scholars would be able to  tie those back to Ancient Greek and Roman philosophy and art. Its time to get over this. The issue is not 'is an idea novel?' but 'how is that idea translated into film (or fill in the medium blank)? Does it work? Is it effective?

What I recall about this film is that it was a fun ride. I enjoyed ""Sawyer"" (my fave character) on LOST, so I was excited to see JH in something else. I liked his character here as well, and I thought the drama surrounding the kidnapping, the relationship conflict that emerged, generated good tension for most of the ride, and to set up the end. 3/4 of the film is that. The big reveal happens toward the end and that was surely entertaining.  Hell, I think I'll watch this one again. Tho, to be fair to my other 4s, I'd have to say this one is more of a 3.5 on my meter. This one's fun, but its not one I'd necessarily add to my collection. So adjust your expectations.

What's scarier than a kid who goes around killing people? In Whisper, David is a kid of fortune, but very introverted. At his birthday party, he's kidnapped and held from ransom, but he's not really the prisoner, they are! I tried to like this movie, but honestly I didn't. The cast was excellent, but the film moves very slowly, very little actually happens, and when it does, you already knew it was coming. It wasn't an awful movie, and this cast is certainly appealing, but something just doesn't click. I'd avoid this one if I were you.",1361577600,,703,4.587301587301587
3193986,4,B000W07EL6,"This is very honest B-movie, which clearly borrowed a lot from ""Omen"" (a much better film), but is definitely more than just a pale copy of this already legendary pillar of horror cinema.

""Whisper"" is the story of 8-years old David Sandborn and four people who kidnapped him for ransom. The leader of the four is an aging bank robber Sidney (Michael Rooker), a dangerous criminal who spend half of his life in jail and who has blood on his hands. His wingmen, thieves Max (Josh Holloway) and Vince (Joel Edgerton) are younger and less dangerous, but they are also career criminals. Max girlfriend Roxanne (Sarah Wayne Callies) was co-opted to take care of the kidnapped child.

Well, as it is signaled on the back cover of the DVD, pretty soon it will become clear, that David is not an ordinary child - and in fact it is not him who is in danger, but the people who abducted him... I will not say more here to avoid spoilers.

The scenario is not bad at all and almost of the film makes for a nice watch. The ending could be a little bit better, but it is not half as bad in most of horror films. The one big hole in the plot is the abysmal idiocy of a policeman who drives to a distant and isolated location without any backup and without even signalling where he is going - but I have seen much worse in B-movies (and not only B-movies)...

All actors performed well, but it was the young Blake Woodruf (he was 12 at that time) who plays David who really impressed me, because unlike Damian in ""Omen"", David speaks a lot and well. And if this young actor can play something else as well as in this film, well, he has a great future before him... Another strong point in the cast is Sarah Wayne Callies, a very beautiful woman but also clearly a very good actress.

Simply get the movie and settle in for a suspenseful tale full of wonderful twists and turns.  Great story, better than average acting and a damned smart kid sporting a preppy sweater-vest over a crisp white shirt buttoned to the hilt. And You know what that means.

If you know your horror, you'll sense the signs of evil lurking at every turn as you savor the tension.

I see people comparing this to the Omen, but the only similarity is that there is a boy involved. The story is nothing like the Omen and slowly works its way to a surprise ending. The story really centered around an abduction and ransom for money.  The horror end of it is revealed over time as it becomes apparent that the boy is something more than the average kid. I thought it was very creative.  As far as similarities to other horror movies, there are only so many settings one can create. It is easy to compare this with many movies but I did not find it cliche' in any way. It was quite unique since it was an area that hasn't been covered exactly in this way. The boy was not represented to be the ""devil"" but something else. If you like religio/horror types of movies you will like this one.

3194015,4,B000W07EL6,"My father and I bought this mainly because it has Dule Hill in it and we wanted to see what he would be like outside of Psych.  Well we got more than we bargained for--the movie also has Josh Holloway ('Sawyer' from Lost), Teryl Rothery (from Stargate SG1) and John Kapelos ('Skanky' from Forever Knight) running around in it.

What was the most entertaining in this film was the little boy, David wasn't just creepy, but unintentionally funny as well.  The young actor really sold the 'demon spawn' act.  Even when he was acting 'innocent' he had this underlying evil intent behind his words that made my skin crawl.  Also, the little smile of triumph each time something bad would happen, was downright chilling.

As far as a story goes we have Max and his fiancee agreeing to kidnap a rich little kid in order to make some easy cash to start their new lives.  Max calls in two associates from his days before he went behind bars--both of whom I wouldn't have trusted with a pencil let alone a kid--and the foursome gets the kid.  It shouldn't be hard to guess who began the kidnapping plot, but some confusing things happen.  Along the way they pass by a tow truck driver and we see flashes of him committing a violent act.  Later they pass by a couple engaging in some fun in the back of the guy's truck and again we see some violent acts.  At first my dad and I weren't certain if David was psychic and he saw these people committing these crimes in the future or what was going on.

That was cleared up pretty quickly.  David is a mind-screw in the highest order.  He manipulates, connives, and seduces with his words and insinuations.  As the movie unfolds the foursome begins to splinter and one by one bad things begin to happen.  Dule Hill plays a newbie detective while John Kapelos plays his commanding officer.  Really their parts are small and inconsequential--just kind of there for when we need to remember this is a kidnapping plot.

The movie moves at a slow pace, almost crawling really, as it sets up that a) Max and his fiancee are not BAD people, just people that do bad things, b) David is the creepiest kid this side of the grave and c) don't grow attached to anyone.  It starts to pick up speed when one of the first kidnappers is dealt with, but it has such dragging moments it can be a chore.  I often found myself really not caring for the fiancee and wondering why she was brought along.  Between doing stupid things (like showing David her face), nagging Max about just letting David go (I think she wanted to go to prison. I really do) and protecting David despite the really bad feelings she was having, I wanted her gone.

The DVD comes with an alternate ending, deleted scenes (which fleshes out some of the 'how the heck did you know THAT?' moments in the film) and extended scenes (none of which are particularly interesting).  There's also a making of featurette, which is cool if you like that sort of thing but nothing spectacular.

Overall this was a much better movie than my dad and I thought originally thought it would be.  As compared to The Omen, I think David is heck of a lot more resourceful and competent.  He gets the job done and then some (what he does to mess with Max's head at the very end is just...yow).",1278201600,,3261,4.447811447811448
3194016,5,B000W07EL6,"I rented this movie from Netflix without knowing anything about it. Yet, I had seen a preview and that whetted my appetite and when I got it, I wasn't expecting much.

Wow, was I wrong!

This wonderfully made chiller is brilliantly done in every category. It looks great and its backdrop of a snow-covered landscape and shadowy old house is a perfect setting as a demon child turns the table on his kidnappers in the worst way possble.

Director Stewart Hendler and writer Christopher Borrelli are to be applauded for trying to do something fresh with the ""Demon Child"" genre--and they more than succeed.  The grisly deaths are innovative and chilling.

But much of the credit for the triumph of this exercise in terror goes to the outstanding cast who give it their all.  Newcomer Blake Woodruff as the creepy, unnerving child monster deserves top accolades and he's matched all the way by handsome, troubled Josh Holloway as the reluctant villian who somehow makes his character vulnerable and tragic. Michael Rooker turns in his usual excellent take on a human monster along with Australian thespian Joel Edgerton.

The best death sequence--and I'll try not to give anything away--takes place on the frozen lake. It's a masterpiece of acting, editing and terror.

I've long got sick of the ""devil child"" genre, thanks to the never-ending stream of Asian horror flicks and their remakes where we're supposed to be terrified by Asian children covered in white make-up, black mascara with their mmouths contorted into a growl.

""Whisper"" does away with all those worn-out devices and you won't soon forget little ""David"" in this memorable chiller by a cast and crew of true artists at the top of their game.",1272240000,,1707,4.919860627177701
3194017,5,B000W07EL6,"When it comes to eeevil kid movies, there are some fabulous examples. WHISPER is one of the better ones. It's up there w/ THE OMEN, JOSHUA, THE BAD SEED, and BLOODY BIRTHDAY. This time, our devil-child is kidnapped by a gang of ne'er-do-wells who have no idea that they have abducted the instrument of their doom! David (Blake Woodruff) only appears to be an angelic 8yo boy. In reality, he is far more! David has many supernatural surprises in store for these kidnappers. They will regret their crime and pay for it dearly. WHISPER delivers the shivers, along w/ some suspenseful thrills. There's even a nice, wicked twist toward the end! Awesome stuff!...",1263427200,3,657,4.823008849557522
3194018,5,B000W07EL6,"Skillfully made horror flick distinguished from its genre companions primarily by Dean Cundey's superb cinematography. Some memorable and powerful overhead shots of Maine. One shot was almost a still with only images of cars moving, very affecting.

Clever touches throughout in the direction. For example, there is a match cut from three cards on the wall, two of them clubs, to blinds with with clover silhouettes.

Very good scoring through much of the film, although the score and the sound design falls off substantially in the last hour, where there is much too much stock foley effects and also stock creepy horror music. But the ""Carol of the Bells"" montage is spectacular, and the Cash ""Ring of Fire"" very apt.

Acting is quite good throughout. Plot somewhat marred by the ""lone cop syndrome"" that so many movies rely on, and an ending perhaps a bit long with some cliched expects, but here again, it was really the sound design and the score that marred it.

Overall, though, a deft film.

As to the DVD, transfer was good quality. Deleted scenes (usually overrated) were not entirely useless here. Some reasonable background on the cop, for example. Making of feature was interesting and frankly surprising in many respects (for instance, that a child stunt double hanging 40-feet above the ground doing acrobatics was used for some of the stunts), although it was missing a description of how they got all those aerial shots (CG? helicopter? some kind of remote dolly?), and not much on the lighting.",1261699200,,1512,4.937007874015748
3194019,2,B000W07EL6,This movie was actually better than I had expected. I bought it not knowing quite what to expect and was pleasantly surprised.  I am a fan of Josh Holloway and was pleased to see he made more than just a cameo in the film.  The plot is pretty easy to predict but overall not bad.,1244592000,,279,4.054545454545455
3194020,4,B000W07EL6,"To start of with that Blake Woodruff shines in this movie. I say that because I saw him in both Cheaper By The Dozen movie but he bairly was in those and he was in Whisper fully and he is a really great actor.

I love this movie yes its kind of a rip off The Omen but The Omen sucked. I like every character in this movie execet Roxanne because I just found her really annoying. This movie has some pritty great deleated scenes and extended scenes not to mention behind the scenes. Its not for a bad price either.",1233100800,,513,4.079207920792079
3194021,4,B000W07EL6,"I saw the preview for this movie in some movie i rented then  thought looked very interesting. In the vein of ""The Omen"" and ""The Good Child"", This movie really pulls it off. Very entertaining and well acted film. The movie moves well and the characters are interesting. The little boy's powers are all through his mind, suggesting thoughts for his own ""evil"" pleasures. It seems as if it's a game for him. Several twists to the movie that make it interesting. The child was kidnapped and held for ransome in a closed down summer camp in the middle of winter in Maine. From that moment, the ""games"" begin. The movie is  entertaining and is well worth to watch at least once! B",1223424000,11,676,4.487804878048781
3194022,5,B000W07EL6,"This was a good flick, yes it was a bit predictable...it been done before. However, it was still a interesting movie,  little horror/action good acting. Its worth your time.",1215388800,,173,4.9655172413793105
3194023,5,B000W07EL6,"First of all I have to agree with the others and their reviews, this isn't the scariest movie in the world. It doesn't have graphic violence, gore, sexual scenes and nudity, and for the most part is campy by comparison of many other horror movies. However at the same time I will say i love it, if for nothing else the psychological suspense it offers the viewer.
The movie starts off staright forward enough, four kidnappers, two of which don't seem to be that bad as people go, get the idea to kidnap a rich kid. Problem is they have serious judgment issues with the kid they choose to kidnap, and I mean serious. Throughout the movie this kid is more calm and calculating tha Hannibal in either the 'Silence of the Lambs' or its sequels. Without practically raising a finger he manages to get into each of their heads and drive them to their deaths in truly maniacal ways.
Personally as far as suspense thrillers go I give it two thumbs up, too bad Stephen King didn't think this one up, because it fits his style to the letter, but don;t take my word for it, see for yourselves.",1206230400,,1082,4.415
3194024,4,B000W07EL6,"This film had a lot of potential but was cut short.  The choice of using Blake Woodruff as the child seems odd to me; however, it turns out that he was perfect for the job.  His innocent looks and ability to adjust his tones of voice to suit the situation was the main reason I gave this a 4 stars.  A Whisper II is a possibility given that we never do exactly what David is here for or who/what he really is.",1203206400,,409,3.9634146341463414
8220877,3,B000W07EL6,"Not bad but not great. When a character is pretty much all-powerful, there isn't much suspense. The ending is somewhat contrived and there is no real explanation. Will not say more to avoid spoilers. Main actors do pretty well with the material they are given, but the story really needs some work.",1526947200,,298,4.75

8220881,4,B000W07EL6,"Great and eerie performances Josh Holloway id a great job as did the rest of the cast. This, I have to explain, it is without a doubt a slow movie. Lots of story and when something happens it is almost overlooked. The kid is spot on for sure. Scary wee guy. The story is nothing new so don't expect any surprises. This is one of those rainy Saturday afternoon movies that I have no doubt will entertain you but don't specifically look for it. ;I don't have a lot to say there are some predictable things so just roll with it.",1523232000,,525,4.207920792079208

Really slick production quality too with beautiful scenery. Special effects were great as well-never cheesy. My family hit the nail on the head comparing it to The Omen and I agree with them that it had a very ""X-Files"" feel to it. I highly recommend this film.",1523145600,,388,4.63768115942029

And then that ending happened. Had I known the film was going to end like that, I would not have watched it. I will still give it 3 stars because I enjoyed the journey, but the destination sucked.",1515110400,,438,4.341463414634147
