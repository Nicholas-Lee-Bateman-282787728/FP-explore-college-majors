4658586,4,B005DETYX2,"And coming from me, that's saying something bc Lifetime movies in the last 8-9 years have been ridiculous with all the man=hating, sex, death (oh excuse me MURDER) movies. I used to watch Lifetime in college, but now I don't even bother except for Frasier reruns. But I digress.

I saw the preview for this on Hallmark (I think) and as a fan of LL's from back in the Ally McBeal days, and this movie seemed light and fun, so I made plans to tune in. I was verrry pleasantly surprised! The writing was great, the actors were great (very rare that not a single character irritates me), and it was just a great miniseries to watch.

From the previews, I thought it was going to be fantasy-based, but it wasn't. One thing I liked about this romance is that they acknowledged that everything was happening fast. One thing I hate about TV movies/romcoms is that everything usually happens in less than a week, so it just seems weird, but even though this one probably took place in 3 months, that fact was lampshaded enough...and then... SPOILER.....Lucy's character still waited a year to get married. So you can imagine that whichever of the guys she married, she still took the time to get to know him. Another pleasant surprise was that, it was only 50/50 percent predictable. I had my #1 guy, but I honestly thought they were going to switch it up...so I was somewhat on the edge of my seat.

This could become a Lifetime classic, and I prefer movies like this one and The 12 Men of Christmas to all the killing movies they show. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I could have done w/o the subplot with the frog boyfriend.

P.S. If I may have a shallow moment: I really loved Lucy's wardrobe! Whomever styled her did a fantastic job",1331251200,,1747,4.45

4658588,5,B005DETYX2,"Noticed this movie from a local rental kiosk. Lucy Liu being a favorite actress. Intrigued by the storyline on the description of the video; I was more than pleasantly surprised by the content of the movieafter viewing.  So taken by the story, characters and acting - that I had to add the movie to my DVD collection. ""Marry Me"" instantly became one of my favorite movies!

4658589,1,B005DETYX2,"I could not stand the main character in this movie, all she did was stomp around and whine about every little thing. If this character were a real person she would have been dumped repeatedly,she is extremely overly dramatic and irritating. I normally love sappy movies like this one, but I just couldn't get past her personality it was terrible. Side note: Men will hate this movie.",1319155200,5,383,4.731343283582089
4658590,5,B005DETYX2,"Finally!  I've been checking Amazon ever since last December when Marry Me first aired to see if it was released yet.  I'm thrilled it's out.

Watching it was a truly unexpected pleasure.  Marry Me has the snappy, witty, rapid-fire dialogue in the tradition of the Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant screwball comedies of the 30s and 40s.  '('Okay, Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd, if you've never seen Hepburn and Grant.  I assume you've all seen Moonlighting.')'  It was thoroughly enjoyable, never slowed down, and yes, she did make the right decision in the end.

Now I can finally zap it from my DVR and not have to worry about accidentally deleting it.  Whew!",1318118400,21,664,4.8053097345132745

4658592,3,B005DETYX2,"This is a feel good light hearted movie. It isn't big drama, or a twisting plot, it is just a sweet romance story about indecision and very believable.

4658621,5,B005DETYX2,"I love this movie.  The film depicts an unrealistic social work office and social worker life, but otherwise it is relatively easy to accept the crazy stuff that happens to the protagonist Rae.  It is perfect for anyone wanting to watch a farfetched romantic movie, the best kind of romantic movie, and additionally perfect because it is almost three hours of men fighting over Lucy Liu (sort of like what happens in When in Rome to Kristen Bell but on a smaller scale).",1424563200,,470,4.650602409638554

4658647,5,B005DETYX2,"Lucy Liu's character has to pick from three men that are after her heart and hand. This is a great movie. It has all the elements that defines a romantic chick flick, but still not too girly that your guy can't watch with you. It is a long movie but not too long. The length is needed to fully bring out the story. There are side plots in the story that have to do with Lucy Liu's family members and her job, but they enhance the movie and don't take away from the main romance. This story grabs you with its reality of life and takes us along until all the situations for all the characters are worked out, including Lucy Liu's character choosing the man to marry. There is beautiful scenery in the movie and even a castle. What more could a chick flick have to peak our interest?",1398124800,2,781,4.213333333333333

4658658,4,B005DETYX2,"This was just too much of a rom com movie for me but I can see where lots of women will love it.  Thus, it would lead viewers astray to give it any less than four stars.  It is about a woman social worker-artist, played by Lucy Liu, who dithers over three men that she may or may not wish to marry.  Actually, I think this film is a remake of a film from the fifties starring Jane Powell called The Girl Most Likely (1958).  In that she too was debating over three guys including one rich one, just like in this film.  That is the jist of the movie, she goes from being dumped at the start to having three guys who want to marry her. One is played by dramatic acting powerhouse Bobby Canavale who is wasted in this film. The guy who had a big role in the firefighter show RESCUE ME plays Luke, a clear frontrunner but almost too good to be true. There are some sideplots involving a troubled teenage girl and a sister with a cheating husband but the best supporting role is her mother played by Annie Potts.  If you love romance, chick lit, etc., then this is probably for you.  If you want to see Liu present day in something even better, catch her in ELEMENTARY, where she is Sherlock Holmes's partner, Dr. Joan Watson.

4658672,5,B005DETYX2,"I watched this when it premiered, and I think I must have watched it several times before deleting it from my DVR. I didn't even think about it being released on DVD, so when I stumbled upon it here on Amazon, I jumped on it and bought two copies! One was for me and the other copy I gave to one of my older sisters for Christmas. She's 34 and loves a good fun, romantic, fairytale chick flick as much as I do, and I am such a sap for anything even remotely romantic.

Lucy Liu is a great leading lady. She plays Rae - a smart, funny, quirky, beautiful and hopeless romantic. I think that is one of the main reasons I like this movie so much, because I'm a hopeless romantic as well, and I can totally relate to Rae. I want everything she wants, and I don't think it's fair for people to tell you that you can't or won't have the fairytale romance of your dreams. Not only is she a dreamer, though, she is a do-gooder, and she plays the role of a charming social worker with ease. It's hard not to like a caring, giving person.

The chemistry between the lead characters is undeniable, they seem to fit so naturally together. I kind of thought there might be something going on off screen, that's how good they are at making me believe they are really in love. The character of Imogene is very likable, and she keeps the movie grounded in reality. I liked her jokes and her meddling. Her story is the source for some tears as well, though. Lifetime movies gotta make you cry, right?

This movie is filled with good jokes, good romance, adventure, little bit of mystery, those what-will-happen-next moments, attractive characters, tearful moments, a cute little dog and much more. It's great! Highly recommended.",1356480000,17,1711,4.425396825396826

4658676,3,B005DETYX2,I like this movie though I find the guy she eventually picks very annoying. I want the hero to be likeable and I just found his chatter very annoying but then again if he'd be sauve and well Matthew McConaughey or the hero's best friend. Also he didn't seem to get her yet the young girl under her charge seemed way smarter.,1342742400,,324,4.241935483870968
4658677,3,B005DETYX2,"It seemed incredibly long.  I liked it at first, and the romance between Lucy Liu and her new boyfriend was sweet.  Then the producers just kept complicating it.  I realize that this is part of the romantic comedy formula.  The couple falls in love and then there is some obstacle that they have to overcome in order to be together, but this was too involved and ultimately tedious to watch.  It would have profited from a simpler storyline without the old boyfriend coming back.  For Liu's character even to contemplate giving up the new guy, who is wonderful to her, for the old guy, who treated her shabbily, makes her look like a simpleton.  By the end of the movie, I was so tired of it all that I barely cared which guy she chose.  She's supposedly smart as a whip on her job, but in her love life she's so dumb and indecisive it's annoying.  I wasn't especially impressed with the acting on the part of either boyfriend, but I thought Enrique Murciano's character was captivating.  He's talented, terrific-looking, and a sympathetic character who actually added something to the movie.  Without him, this would have been a 1- to 2-star movie at best.  I recommend that you rent it before buying, just to be sure you really want it.",1338508800,,1238,4.577272727272727
4658678,4,B005DETYX2,"This movie surprised me.  I like Lucy Liu and decided to give it a chance.  For a cable movie, it really got into the heart of relationships and shows the light and dark sides.
