6077321,1,B00GHXYKV4,It's pretty clear people want to buy this. Why even list it so far in advance without a release date? It's been three months now and no date still. Just stop the tease. Or release another season.,1390003200,3,195,4.297297297297297
6077322,1,B00GHXYKV4,I own all the survivor episodes that have been released.  When I ordered Micronesia and China S15 and S16 in NOVEMBER I expected them to get here soon.  They haven't even been released Yet!!! A little disappointed about that.,1389657600,,225,4.743589743589744
6077323,5,B00GHXYKV4,Does anyone know when this and the Survivor: China season will be released? I have all the seasons 1 through 14 and season 20.,1389312000,,126,4.291666666666667
6077324,5,B00GHXYKV4,This has some of the best episodes back to back to back with Tribal Councils that just leave your jaw on the floor!  Can't wait for them to officially have this released.  Pre-order it now!!!,1385856000,7,191,4.428571428571429
6077325,5,B00GHXYKV4,"I've been waiting a long time for this to be released, and it's finally here! A must watch season! A solid first half, but the best ever post merge game. Blindsides, strategy, and my favorite cast. Watch it. Relive it. I honestly am very excited!",1383696000,12,246,4.488888888888889
6077326,5,B00GHXYKV4,"Survivor Micronesia is a great season of Survivor. This season is fans vs. favorites with a batch of some of the most beloved players in Survivor history returning. Plenty of Puppet Masters and wanna be Puppet Masters, you decide. Some really bad moves combined with really strategic moves makes this a great season.

6077355,3,B00GHXYKV4,"I rewatched this season because so many fans have said that the winner is one of the best Survivor players ever.  I can't say I agree, but the season was relatively entertaining, due to the reappearance of favourites such as Ozzy, Cerie and Jonothan.",1409184000,,250,4.681818181818182
6077356,5,B00GHXYKV4,"Forget Boston Rob and Russell Hantz, if you want to learn how to play Survivor and WIN, watch Parvati.",1408233600,,102,4.421052631578948
6077357,5,B00GHXYKV4,"Thanks so much to CreateSpace for releasing these!  As a huge fan it's awesome to continue collecting the set and this season's one of the best, easily.  So many blindsides, great characters and strategists.

6077359,5,B00GHXYKV4,"I really love this season it's absolutely brilliant and theres a lot of things happening in this survivor that the others didn't have. This is a great season to watch. I'm a big fan of the series but this is a classic. Please keep releasing more survivors on dvd. I'm ready for more, I want more survivors added to my dvd collection. Please..",1398988800,,342,4.444444444444445
6077360,5,B00GHXYKV4,Arrived on time and in new condition. This season is as interesting as all previous ones in exploring what people will do for money.,1397779200,,132,4.541666666666667

6077364,5,B00GHXYKV4,I'm a true blue survivor fan. I try to get every survivor series when they come on the market. Yes there are some series better than other series but they are all GOOD. I just wish I was young for I would definitely try out for one.,1394582400,2,232,3.9574468085106385
6077365,5,B00GHXYKV4,"Fans vs Favorites - the first season to feature a mix of returning players with new players. Filled with ""blind sides"" right from the start, mental breakdowns, injuries with evacuations and probably one of the dumbest moves in Survivor history.",1394496000,,244,5.125
6077366,5,B00GHXYKV4,Very pleased with the product.  Would recommend it to anyone.  Looking forward to future episodes.  As usual outstanding service for Amazon.com,1394409600,,143,5.714285714285714

6077368,1,B00GHXYKV4,"This was the worst.  There were several episodes that wouldn't play and I even got replacement discs to boot, but they were just as bad.  I believe the master copy must have been bad.",1394150400,,183,4.352941176470588
6077369,5,B00GHXYKV4,"Okay...my family is a bunch of Survivor geeks who watch whole seasons in about two weeks.  It's a wonderful family event.  Can get through an hour episode in 40 minutes without all the commercials.  This season was by far the best yet...unbelievable storylines that I just don't want to tell you so I don't spoil it.  Some crazy stuff and ""first time"" things happened on this season.",1394064000,,383,4.6716417910447765
6077370,5,B00GHXYKV4,"This is without a doubt the best survivor I have ever seen, It has so many amazing characters and blindsides and an extremely deserving winner. The extra features are also very insightful. I'm a massive Survivor fan haven't missed an episode yet in 27 seasons and this particular season of Survivor has had me watch it multiple times. A must have",1394064000,,346,4.688524590163935
6077371,5,B00GHXYKV4,"I waited and waited for it to finally be released. LOVE LOVE LOVE Survivor, have them all on Amazon Instant Video, but there's nothing like having the actual DVD version to treasure forever. Only wish the seasons were released on DVD way quicker, I'm just not patient enough.",1393718400,,275,4.75
6077372,5,B00GHXYKV4,"Please produce more of the later shows of survivor S17,18,19,21, and any later seasons on DVD. I will buy all of them.
Thank you.",1393286400,,129,4.416666666666667
6077373,5,B00GHXYKV4,"Maybe the most FUN season ever made. Parvati and Cirie are Survivor monsters and it's a kick to watch 'em go. Flat out AMAZING fly-on-the-wall moments (you wanna slap yourself- it's that good). Crazy schemes and the smiles are contagious. There's a few hurt feelings, sure, but it doesn't play out like one of those mean-spirited seasons that come later. Watch Eliza's face, it's HYSTERICAL.",1391558400,,391,5.030769230769231
6077374,5,B00GHXYKV4,I WATCH THESE A NIGHT WHEN I CAN NOT SLEEP . GREAT HUMAN INTERACTION. I HAVE BEEN HOOKED FROM START.,1391558400,,100,4.05

6077376,5,B00GHXYKV4,"Erik, Cirie, Parvati, Jonathan, Amanda and Ozzy are in the box will wait because Jonathan Got A Cut On His Knee and he got a bad cut on his knee and it's really sick it got infected and It was 2008 Parvati won that was Amanda and Parvati in the reunion that was very good because Jonathan Penner was born in 1962 that's the year How The West Was Won was made that year because he was very good and his wife was born in 1965 that's the year The Sound Of Music",1390867200,,458,3.935483870967742
