8301198,5,B001F7Q7CC,"Don Meyer should be a household name for basketball fans, but for most he is not.  Coach Meyer is the all time winningest coach in NCAA Men's basketball history, but he did his winning at small universities that did not play ""big time"" basketball.

What Coach Meyer did though was build programs that were student and principle centered, insisted his players learn and master the fundamentals of the game, play hard and play as a team.

Despite his success, Coach Meyer is a humble individual who has gone to great lengths to share his knowledge, expertise and wisdom as a basketball coach for those who wish to learn more about the game.  This DVD is a great example of how Coach Meyer shares what his years of coaching experience have taught him are the keys to winning basketball.
