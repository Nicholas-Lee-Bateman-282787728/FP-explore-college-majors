1553075,1,B00005JOX5,"Perhaps one of the worst movies ever made. For a comedy, I only laughed perhaps twice in two hours. I thought it would be a funny send up of American Idol. It wasn't. But it was painfully slow, dull, and boring, and perhaps that's why a week after it opened there were only 10 people in the entire theatre besides the three of us. Dennis Quaid wasn't funny, Hugh Grant wasn't funny, and really I wish I had left and asked for a refund. It's amazing how a movie like that can make it to the screen. I would have done better to watch Dave again with Kevin Kleine. This movie was an American travesty from start to finish!",1146355200,4,619,4.2100840336134455
1553076,2,B00005JOX5,"""American Dreamz"", written, produced and directed by Paul Wietz.

There are many shades of comedy, from the cheerful hues of ""The Great Race"" to the bold vaudeville patterns of ""Duck Soup"", to the dark satirical shades of ""The Loved One"".  It's a tricky job to determine the tone of a comedy, and just as important as the success of the jokes themselves.  Such is the case with ""American Dreamz"", the latest Paul Weitz comedy.  It seems to be reaching for the satirical sharpness of ""Network"" or ""To Die For"", but the overall tone is so gentle it throws the dark subject matter into bold, awkward relief.

""Dreamz"" contains four sub-plots.  The first involves President Staton (Dennis Quaid), a Bush-like statesman who is having a crisis after his latest election victory.  He realizes he knows nothing about the nation, and is scrambling to to view things beyond his staff's carfeully filtered briefings.  His approval ratings have plummeted, and rumors abound of a nervous breakdown.  The solution?  Have the president guest judge the highest-rated television show ever - the ""Idol""-like ""American Dreamz"".

We're then introduced to Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant), the Simon-Cowell-style host of the program.  He's being dumped by his current paramour, and is feeling bored, a prisoner of the show's success.  To keep himself interested, he makes increasingly bizarre contestant choices.

This involves Omer (Sam Golzari), an inept Iraqi terrorist whose secret passion is show tunes, driving his fellow extremists to distraction.  He's soon 're-assigned' to stay with his relatives in California as a sleeper cell, awaiting orders that will (presumably) never come.  Omer meets his gay cousin Iqbal (Tony Yalda), who has applied to become a ""Dreamz"" contestant.  Things get complicated, though, when Omer's good-naturedness gets him chosen over Iqbal.

""Dreamz's"" talent search also discovers Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore), a calculating manipulator determined to win the show at any cost.  She too has just dumped her steadfast boyfriend William Williams (Chris Klein) - she is repelled by his kind heart - and he responds by enlisting in the army.  Tweed finds a kindred spirit in Sally, or at least a worthy adversary -  he's never met anyone more self-centered than he is.  Naturally, she's a shoe-in for the show.  When William returns from Iraq wounded, her agent encourages her to fake renewing the romance to boost her vote count.

Since the president is now to be a guest judge, and Omer a contestant, the terrorist leaders order Omer to spearhead an assassination attempt.  Iqbal begins managing him, and Omer's popularity is a direct threat to Sally's victory.  Naturally, everything races together on a collision course.

Most of this isn't very believable, even on comedic terms.  It's never convincing that Quaid's president would allow himself to get into this situation.  It's also tough to buy that Omer would be chosen over Iqbal, as Iqbal is more entertaning simply standing around talking than Omer is singing (Yalda's performance is one of the most consistently entertaining in the film).  Additionally, Omer is too conflicted from the beginning to be very vivid as a performer or a terrorist.  Sally is pushed to new heights of ambition by her agent, but this role hardly seems necessary considering her new love interest (and her own nature seems too knowing).

It's also odd that we begin the film with the president in a position of strength (having won the election).  It would seem like there'd be a lot more opportunity for suspense (and satire) by setting the story in the beginning of the re-election campaign *and* the latest season of ""Dreamz"", and have the film take place over that year. The plot would then culminate in the election and the finalists' showdown.  The film as it stands has little tension - we know only a couple of the contestants can have a chance to win, or there's no story.

This premise intrinsically involves the corruptive powers of fame, coupled with a terrorist assination of the President on national television.  This is pretty dark stuff, but the film never seems to want to move beyond the tone of a light cartoonish farce.  As a result, most of the jokes fall uncomfortably flat.  Quaid is miscast - he seems far too handsome, intelligent and confident to portray a buffoonish proxy growing dissatisfied with his own powerlessness.  Dafoe's Cheney never seems that nasty, either - he's simply doing what needs to be done to put this guy across to the public.  The Kendoo/Tweed romance isn't a bad set-up, but their mutual wickedness doesn't focus into something darkly compelling.  Instead, it simply curdles into two despicable people who probably deserve each other.

Considering how crowd-pleasing the film wants to be, it takes a big risk by making *the entire cast* caught up in the struggle for fame and power.  It's fine to make all of your main characters corruptible, but the script doesn't have the courage of its convictions, and there's no innocent secondary characters for contrast.  Even William gets sucked into the fame/power whirlpool, but it's never clear why, or even appropriate.  The film could use William better as a moral center, unwittingly duped by Sally, who'd been sleeping with Tweed all along.  This would make for a stronger betrayal in the last third, and better justify his desperate actions as a result.  Iqbal, had he been the contestant, could have simply been blinded by ambition, manipulated by the terrorists until the last minute.

The film seems to want to portray this greed for fame and power as destructive, but only two characters truly reap the whirlwind.  If you want to show everyone as greedy and manipulative - and make a comedic morality tale - the script needed to take it to its logical conclusion and destroy almost all of them.  Sally, unstoppable and indestructible (perhaps like Reese Witherspoon's Tracy Flick in ""Election"", a truly sublime dark comedy), would have made the perfect survivor.  Unfortunately, ""American Dreamz"" hedges its bets, wins some battles, but loses the war.",1146355200,,6098,5.060120240480962
1553077,2,B00005JOX5,"A horribly executed satire piece that is boring from its start to its ridiculous finish.  The humor is dry and the acting is poor, I can't believe Hugh Grant would sign on to an atrocity like this considering the direction of his career as of late.  I gave this 2 stars only because of Dennis Quaid's very humorous and satirical portrayal of the American president, it's a shame that his was the only performance in the film that made me laugh.  With the country's current take on both President Bush and American Idol, the concept of this film is good from a pop culture standpoint, unfortunately better screenwriting may have made a world of difference for this disaster.",1146355200,,673,4.686440677966102

1553079,2,B00005JOX5,"""American Dreamz"", the new film from writer-director Paul Weitz (director of ""American Pie"", ""About a Boy"") showed promise as an interesting, funny, unusual satire on American pop culture. It isn't. It may be one of the most disappointing films released this year.

Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant), a conceited, rich and hugely popular producer and host of the most popular show in America, ""American Dreamz"", a weekly show showcasing amateur singers who want to become the next musical superstar, is at a crossroads in his life. After each performance, Tweed either gives them praise or eviscerates them with harsh criticism. Then the public votes and the people with the most votes move on to the next week. Tweed demands that his producers find a more diverse talent pool, including a Jewish and an Arab contestant, to help liven up this season. President Staton (Dennis Quaid), having just won re-election, decides to read a newspaper. He is shocked to read of all of the problems in the world. His Chief of Staff (Willem Dafoe) panics and tries to get the President to continue to receive his briefings, but the President holes himself up, staying out of the public eye, for three weeks reading anything and everything he can. The public begins to wonder if the President has gone insane prompting the Chief of Staff to arrange a series of public appearances, everything from a `meet and greet' with Carmen Electra to becoming a guest judge on the season finale of ""American Dreamz"". Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore) is a middle class girl from Ohio who is picked to appear on the show. She is so sure that she will become a star she dumps her long time boyfriend William Williams (Chris Klein) who promptly enlists in the army, arrives in Iraq, is shot and returns home, all in the space of two weeks. Omer (Sam Golzari), an inept terrorist, is banished from the terrorist training camp and sent to Orange County to live with an aunt and uncle. Omer is to live like a normal person and wait for the call to action. His gay cousin, Iqbal (Tony Yalda) has erected a huge stage in the basement of their home and applied to be on ""American Dreamz"". One day, Omer is performing ""Luck Be a Lady"" on the stage when producers from ""American Dreamz"" arrive, looking for Iqbal, and ask him to participate.

Normally, such a convoluted synopsis would almost guarantee that I would at least like the film. And this synopsis only scratches the surface. A film with so many stories, with so much going on, is at least going to keep you interested. Right? Wrong. Only one of the characters is likable or interesting and this creates a sort of vacuum, draining everything of life. As we watch all of these characters moving through the stories, we become bored. Yes, they are doing things. But we don't really care because we have no feelings for any of the characters. Even bad characters can be interesting, causing us to have some feelings about what they are doing.

On more than one occasion, characters exchange dialogue and then stop, pausing, before continuing. This is the equivalent of two actors on stage who are engaged in witty banter and then laughter and applause from the audience cause them to stop, so no one will miss a word. In a film you can't do this. The best, funniest films are the films we laugh through 50% of the jokes. When we do this, we might go to see the film again, or rent it on DVD, catching the remainder of the laughs. When you do this in film, it becomes the equivalent of watching a bad comedian doing stand up. Every time he tells a joke, he waits for the laughter. If there are laughs, he stops and waits before continuing. In ""Dreamz"", there aren't that many laughs.

A satire shouldn't be easy and it should take us to places we never expected. In ""Dreamz"", all of the subject matter is far too easy. It is like watching an extended ""Saturday Night Live"" skit. Hugh Grant playing a Simon Cowell rip off. Okay, that's amusing. But when his character doesn't do anything new or unusual, it becomes boring. From his television persona, we might expect Simon Cowell-like Martin Tweed to be self-obsessed, full of his stardom and dating young girls. But what could Grant and director Weitz have done with the character that we wouldn't expect? A lot, but it isn't on the screen. Quaid plays a Bush-like President. His father was President, he is from the South, he speaks with platitudes. Not a far stretch. And certainly a subject ripe for parody. But ""Saturday Night Live"" does a better job of lampooning the President on a weekly basis. The President doesn't know that there are three different types of Iraqis. Ha-ha-ha. Again, so much could've been done that isn't even attempted. Did the writer-director get lazy?

Mandy Moore plays a stardom obsessed young teenage girl. Clearly, she is supposed to be a cross of Kelly Clarkson and Britney Spears. There are some funny ideas and jokes here, about Spears, how fame changes you, etc. But her character changes her mind every few seconds and it becomes inconsistent and ultimately boring as well. We get it. She is so obsessed with fame, willing to do anything. Yes, we get it.

The one standout in the cast is Sam Golzari. From the moment we first meet him at the Terrorist Training Camp (and we see they are shooting a recruitment video, a nice touch) and he starts singing along to a record of show tunes, we realize this character is something unusual and strange. As soon as he arrives in Orange County and starts interacting with his aunt and uncle and two cousins, we begin to get a glimpse of what this film could've been. The two cousins are clearly changed by live in an affluent community in Orange County. They take Omer to the mall. His aunt says ""Maybe we should get Omer his own credit card?"" His uncle replies ""Sure, why not."" The two cousins are clearly spoiled and their parents eat it up. This is the American Dream, to come to this country and provide a better lifestyle for your children. Many may not see their lifestyle as better, but it is for these people.

After Omer becomes a hit on ""American Dreamz"" and the terrorists approach him with their plan, he begins to have second thoughts. He is living his dream, performing songs on a television show (which is watched at the Terrorist Camp, thanks to satellite and TIVO) and isn't sure he has the heart to go through with the plan.

""American Dreamz"" held a lot of promise. But the promise isn't fulfilled. Because many of the jokes fall flat and the parody isn't at the level we would hope, the film seems a lot longer than it actually is. Not good when we are watching a comedy.",1145750400,13,6626,4.623619371282922
1553080,3,B00005JOX5,"Director Paul Weitz has had his ups (""About A Boy"") and his downs (""American Wedding""). All of his films, including his turn as an actor in ""Chuck and Buck,"" have their pleasures and his handling of actors, as in Hugh Grant in both this film and in ""About a Boy"" is flawless.

Unfortunately with ""American Dreamz,"" though Weitz's talent with actors and his edgy social and moral outlook is very much operating at full force, most of ""AD"" just doesn't work: a case of a film sagging and sinking under too many ideas most of which go nowhere.

With all of that said though, ""AD"" still has much going for it: Hugh Grant's acidic, nasty, hedonistic take on (and yes I will say it) Simon Cowell...down to the haircut and tight dark tee shirts, Mandy Moore's sweet-on-the-surface, iron butterfly Sally Kendoo, John Cho's sweet-faced, perpetually freaked-out Ittles and Dennis Quaid's befuddled, bumbling take as President Staton.

It was inevitable that someone would drink from the deep, satiric-rich trough that is ""American Idol"" and ""American Dreamz"" has its fun moments and even whole scenes that work but basically it's pretty much a mess thematically. Yet nonetheless, Weitz's facility with actors saves it from being a total waste of time.",1145750400,4,1241,4.956730769230769

1553082,1,B00005JOX5,"Martin Tweddy (Hugh Grant) is the intensely cynical host of an American Idol style TV program. Ever on the lookout for wanna be singers with public appeal, he brings in Sally Keendo (Mandy Moore) and Omar (Sam Golzari) as contestants for the show. Sally is a ruthlessly ambitious girl from small town Ohio, while Omar is an incompetent terrorist who really just wants to sing Broadway show tunes. From there the film descends downward into a weak effort to satirize everyone and everything from George Bush to the Midwest, from Muslims to Iraq War vets.

The attitude of the movie is quite mean spirited and rude, like an obnoxious teen-ager who thinks he is smarter than everyone else but is actually an idiot himself. I really have no idea who the target audience for this flick is. It is far too crude and simple minded for more serious movie goers and I doubt that the mainstream public will be drawn to a movie that basically sets out to ridicule them.

1553084,2,B00005JOX5,"American Snoozzzzze (""with a z"")

Although American Dreamz has moments of socially redeeming value and a really impressive cast, it is neither satire (it is broad farce), nor is it particularly ""smart"". But it is being called both. (For an example of smart satire, see ""Thank You for Smoking"".) Laughs here are mostly dutiful or nervous. This reminded me of something between amateurish college skits, all dressed up with Hollywood production values and way-overdone make-up, and ""Saturday Night Live"" with too much time on its hands, cobbled together with an uneasy terrorist plot twist. Written and directed by Paul Weitz, director of ""American Pie"" and ""About a Boy"", this movie's reach exceeds its grasp: aiming for the ""About a Boy"" audience, it hits ""American Pie"" humor, if it hits, instead.

It's simply too easy to lampoon George W. Bush (overplayed by Dennis Quaid as a ventriloquist's dummy) for too many things, and it's been done. Marcia Gaye Hardin plays a very respectable Laura Bush clone. A sly casting touch is having Willem Dafoe eerily made up as a cross between Dick Chaney and Donald Rumsfield, being the puppeteer and the ventriloquist behind the President. Hugh Grant is far too charming to be able to carry off this version of the loutish and soulless ""Simon Cowell""-style host of ""American Dreamz"".

Since the show gets more votes than are cast in Presidential elections, this Administration decides to bolster sagging poll numbers by having the President appear as a guest judge on ""American Dreamz"".  Mandy Moore is quite good as the ambitious ""babe"" contestant, and Shohreh Aghdashloo, an Oscar contender for her supporting role in ""House of Sand and Fog"", is a gem who sparkles whenever she is on screen, however small the role. I was baffled as to why Chris Klein seemed to be either trying to channel or satirize Keanu Reeves, but it was difficult to tell which, and not a particularly worthwhile exercise.  (I would personally rather have seen Keanu Reeves.) Sam Golzari, playing the accidental Arab contestant who happens to be a member of a terrorist sleeper cell, slowly grows on you as he ""Omer-izes"" his Dreamz audience, but it is Omer's American family which has by far the best scenes.

The movie is overly ambitious as farce, and yet mostly tries to go for easy laughs. At its most uncomfortable, it appeared to be trying misguidedly and ham-handedly to satirize ""Paradise Now"" or ""The War Within"", both serious, excellent movies, nominated for major awards.  ""American Dreamz"" may qualify for Razzie nominations in costume and make-up.

It might be as important a movie as it wants to be when in a distant century, the DVD is discovered under rubble or taken out of a time capsule for a too-facile historical comparison of our pop culture obsession with the ""bread and circuses"" mentality near the end of the Roman Empire. But the narcissism of the movie itself will be the best argument for our generation's willingness to try to find an intellectual excuse or even entertainment where there is so little.",1145577600,,3048,4.951076320939334

1553204,3,B00005JOX5,"I think it was Woody Allen who wrote, ""Comedy is tragedy with distance"".

The basic premise of AMERICAN DREAMZ is hilarious: To boost his popularity, the President of the United States agrees to appear as a judge on a television show, not unlike AMERICAN IDOL.  The President, delightfully played as a moron by Dennis Quaid, is not unlike George W., his wife (Marcia Gay Harden) is reminiscent of First Lady Laura and chief advisor Willem Dafoe is a Karl Rowe clone.

The comedy, written and directed by Paul Weitz, also looks into the personal lives of the TV show's producer-host (Hugh Grant), a rather self-centered fellow, as well as two of the contestants, Mandy Moore from Ohio, who is sort of a female version of Grant, and Sam Golzari, a totally incompetent Arab terrorist with a yen for Broadway show tunes.

All of the performances are first-rate and the picture offers many amusing moments.  The problem with the movie is that it also tries to find humor with the war in Iraq, where many people are being killed every day, and, worse yet, it has a major subplot that involves a plan by Arab terrorists to kill the President.

Unfortunately, this is a bit too close to the painful truth to evoke many laughs.

Even today, more than a half century after the event, one does not find humor in the Holocaust.  You can make fun of Hitler, but not the Holocaust.

With this movie, you can poke fun at former President George Bush, but the threat of a terrorist plot to kill him is not funny.

Do we laugh at 9/11?

1553205,1,B00005JOX5,"This film pretends to be a spoof about the current obsession with superficial fame as expressed through 'singing' 'talent' shows. Whoever wrote this film is not clever enough to pull this off.

The main characters in the film are :

1) An 'camp' Arab guy and his 'friend'. His colleagues want him to blow up the US president when they meet on the singing show (he is the finalist).
2) A blue eyed blond haired 'American girl' (the other finalist)
3) Her boyfriend (who wants to marry her)
4) The host of the show (played by Hugh Grant).

The problems I had with the film were :

1) It was hardly a spoof of this current 'celebrity culture'. This is evident in the fact that character 2) ends up being the 'good guy' character. She is portrayed as the sensible one in the film!
2) Character 2) ends up sleeping with character 4), yet character 2) still is portrayed as a good person in the film! In fact her boyfriend (character 3) gets so annoyed that he picks up the bomb which the Arab guy has dropped in the bin (he decides not to bomb everyone in the end) and threatens to kill everyone on set. In other words, the woman is unfaithful, but was portrayed in a good light and the man is ridiculed for being upset over his partner's infidelity! How ridiculous is this?
3) The portrayal of the Arab guy and his colleagues was the most reprehensible part of the film. First of all the Arab guy who is more western friendly is portrayed as lighter coloured, more camp (yes, they use 'campness' to signify western culture v. Arab culture) than the others. His colleagues who want him to carry out the suicide bombings are portrayed as more obviously Arab with beards, stronger accents, less western clothes and a backward mentality. The battle is basically portrayed as a western culture v Arab culture battle for the mind of Omar (the camp Arab guy). The Arab 'culture' is represented by suicide bombers. Of course, the western culture wins.

The film is dumb pathetic film and a (very small) part of the propaganda war that allows western governments to get away with the murder of so many Sunnis, Shias because they 'are all suicide bombers' who 'hate the west' and want to 'stop all of our liberties'. Subconsciously, many people who watch this film will walk out of this film with a small message of confirmation that Arabs are backward barbarians who are just dying (pun intended) for OUR help (the Taleban, Sadam Hussein, The Shah of Iran, the House of Saud, Hosni Mubarak etc etc)!!

And how many have died in the Middle East at the hands of such idiocy. And what have the Arabs ever done to us in the west (how many died on 9/11 v Iraq and Afghan wars - do the maths).

Whilst many will disagree with this view, I would only be interested if their disagreement is justified by sound reasoning.",1219968000,2,2799,4.498031496062992
1553206,5,B00005JOX5,"""American Dreamz"" is a black-comedy/satire about an unwilling Middle Eastern terrorist who is called on to murder the U.S. President when he becomes a contestant on ""American Dreamz"", and ""American Idol""-esque talent show.

When ""American Dreamz"" was on at the cinema, I thought it was just another stupid comedy making fun of reality-television, much like Ben Elton's ""Chart Throb"" (which I found to be disappointing, might I add). It was only when I found a cheap DVD copy of this film that I decided to give it a chance, and man, was I surprised. ""American Dreamz"" is smart, funny and highly underrated.

The idea of blending a comedy about reality television with a topical issue such as terrorism is just brilliant, and the script and the acting are great too. Hugh Grant is perfect as the self-absorbed Martin Tweed, host of ""American Dreamz"", a character so egocentric that he makes comments like ""sometimes I envy myself"", and Dennis Quaid does an equally good job as a President who bears more than a passing resemblance to George W. Book.  Normally, I can't stand Hugh Grant, but for the first time in his career, I actually liked him. In fact, in the final scenes, he and Quaid had me rolling around my lounge room laughing. I think the thing that I liked most about this film, though, was the fact that all of the characters are written in a sympathetic manner. Writer/director Paul Weitz could easily have chosen to make fun of his cast of characters, but instead he seems to genuinely care for them and as a result he presents characters whom the audience can genuinely like and cheer for. Weitz did a similar thing in his directorial debut, ""American Pie"", and it was for this reason, I believe, that ""American Pie"" stands out as being one of the best teen movies of recent years.

This film came and went at the cinemas far too quickly and I think that is mainly due to the fact that most people didn't realize what this film was actually about. Now that it is available on DVD, however, it is definitely worth giving it a chance and you might find yourself as pleasantly surprised as I was.",1213488000,3,2107,4.640750670241287
1553207,2,B00005JOX5,"This is barely a spiffy spoof on American culture and politics that might be all too close to a current TV show called ""American Idol.""  Hugh Grant is a producer of the wildly successful ""American Dreamz."" He is professionally engaging and personally shallow, self-centered, and sleazy.

On the other side of the globe is an uncoordinated, two-left-footed terrorist in training whose mother was killed by an American bomb. Unfortunately, he loves American show tunes, and is caught by the silhouette of the light in his tent, dancing to one of them. His commanders decide that he will never be of any use, and order him to go to America as a sleeper agent. He is to take up residence with his aunt, uncle and two cousins. They plan on letting him sleep for a long time.

Then there is the President of the United States, played by Steven Quaid. He is a bone-headed, numbskull who gets everything he is supposed to say from his chief of staff, played by Willem Defoe. One morning he has the revelation that everything is not just black and white, and he goes on a reading frenzy beginning with the NY Times. He stays in the residence for weeks, just reading.

Mandy Moore is a blond, blue-eyed Karaoke singer from Anywhere, Ohio, and she definitely wants to become an American Dreamz Princess. She jilts her boyfriend as she finds out that she is selected for the show. The jilted beau decides to join the army where he is given only two weeks training before he finds himself in Iraq, where he gets shot in his tattooed arm that bears the name of his ex-girlfriend. He returns home to express his undying devotion to her.

(If you need to take a break from reading this review, I will understand).

Chief of staff, Willem Defoe decides to get the president out of his reading lethargy by booking him as a judge on ""American Dreamz."" American Dreamz Dream Team do their producer's bidding to find someone who is more ethnic than the average American. They should find someone from the middle east who they will ensure gets to the finals. And who do they discover practicing on his cousin's set in the basement of his aunt and uncle's California home? You guessed it!

Now the terrorists find their opportunity to strike at the clod of the United States. Will the sleeper terrorist who is love-struck with the American culture strap himself with a bomb, and blow up the president, or judge?

You'll have to see the movie to find out.

The acting is excellent and Hugh Grant deviates from his usual role as a sensitive, bumbling, loveable guy to heartless, intolerable creep.

As for actually seeing this movie, it's kind of a bomb. (Sorry, bad choice of words).

1553208,3,B00005JOX5,"This movie potential to be good, but falls short in execution.  This isn't to say it is a particularly bad movie, it just has some serious problems with it.

The performances range from good to painful.  Grant is really the highlight of the film, and the one truly enjoyable part to watch.  He gets most the good jokes, and really gets to live up the character.  Moore is fine, if a little plain to watch.  I have only really seen her own a character once, so this comes as no big surprise.  The real problems come in Dafoe, Quaid, and Klein.  Dafoe and Quaid put in fine performances, but the characters themselves are poorly conceived caricatures better suited for Saturday Night Live then as full characters in a film.  Klein had the only truly obnoxious performance, with his normal doe eyed, sincere style going way to far.

The story also has a lot of issues.  The movie is about the American Dreamz contest, and yet most of that is shown in montague while the rest of the movie focuses on a very cheap stab at the administration.  The entire president sketch is better for web video's or sketch comedy rather than a movie plot-line.

This isn't a bad movie, it is just not a particularly great movie.  It is split between trying to be a comedy and a social message, and neither works.  Don't avoid watching this, but also don't go out of your way.",1212019200,,1354,4.469387755102041
1553209,4,B00005JOX5,"A hilarious send-up of politics, reality TV, pop-culture marketing, and the image of America, this movie is not to be missed.

The movie opens, oddly enough, on a Taliban training camp. Robed terrorists are going through their paces as another man films their activities. However, in each scene, there is ONE terrorist who is messing up the shot - falling over the wall instead of jumping over it, dropping awkwardly from the climbing pole, misfiring his weapon. We discover that this person is Olmer (Sam Golzari), who is only at the camp because he is related to its director. In the privacy of his tent at night, Olmer listens to old 45s of showtunes and dreams of being a song and dance man. The camp director, wishing to get Olmer off his hands for good, packs him off to live with another relative in California, telling him that his sleeper cell will contact him when the time is right (but fully intending to abandon him).

Meanwhile, Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant), the British host of a very American-Idol-like reality TV show, is trying to keep his program at the top of the ratings. They are looking for a crop of contestants for the new season, and they discover Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore), a singer from a rural area of Ohio. When he learns that Sally has a lovestruck Iraq War veteran (Chris Klein) for a boyfriend, something sparks Tweed's mind. He charges his team to also find an Arab and a Jew as contestants, leading to what he hopes will be hefty human interest drama during the show.

In the meantime, America's President (Dennis Quaid) is looking for some high profile appearances to boost approval ratings. It is decided that he'll be a guest judge on the final episode of the show, moving all the major players towards an inevitable and thoroughly entertaining conclusion.

I nearly busted a gut during this movie. It is such an accurate, sly parody of American society and the U.S. marketing machine. Performances are wonderful and light. Quaid is chuckle-worthy as the befuddled president, and Moore is a force as the driven, scheming Sally Kendoo. Golzari's Omer personifies the world's fascination with America. The script is fresh, funny, and smart. Rounding out the cast are Marcia Gay Harden as the first lady, Jennifer Coolidge as Sally's pushy stage mom, and Willem Dafoe as the President's chief of staff.

1553210,4,B00005JOX5,"I definitely got four stars worth of entertainment out of this DVD. There were enough laughs to keep me watching, and I particularly loved the Broadway show-tune-loving terrorist dancing in his tent.

After watching years of American Idol and watching the news, American Dreamz almost seemed like reality TV! There was nothing here to be offended by, plenty to laugh at -- and I still think it's funny after the second viewing.

Dennis Quaid plays a ""stanton"" that is every Bush-is-an-idiot steretype in the book that didn't require him to be a Nazi or a mastermind. That said, Quaid's president was one of the few truly nice characters, who within the context of the movie at least redeemed himself, and was one of the two high points in the movie as it commited two cardinal sins for ANY movie. No Originality, and no (few) characters you can actually LIKE.

The only other two who you could really like were his wife (a Laura bush clone) and the not-really-wanting to be terrorist (who was being shoved along by his relatives to be one). Everybody else including Hugh Grant and Mandy Moore in the main roles were just vile people. They knew they were vile, and they kept at it.

There was no originality in the humor - and I've seen plenty of sharply funny political humor from Colbert and the Daily Show - every plot point read like the litany of complaints Bush detractors have, and no more. The social satire was no better - down to the complaints of American idol pandering to the masses, unemployment, etc.

Incidentally, I could have lived with that and been disappointed. What really turned me off and disgusted and angered me to no end  was the treatment of the one main character who was a soldier. He was like a Ted Rall ""how are our soldiers like suicide bombers/misguided idiots"" cartoon come to life. He and his position as an easily manipulated idiot as a soldier was used as a puppet by nearly everyone for ratings. Not content to make him out to be an idiot, the one (brief) scene with any other soldiers he comments on ""only two weeks of training"" - hinting that it was systemic.

Frankly, if I wasn't with friends who I like despite occasionally lapping this crap up, I would have walked out. It gets an extra star because Quaid did a decent job, and there were a few nice jokes in it.",1195344000,,2156,4.5038363171355495

Meanwhile, President Staton (Quaid) has just won a second term.  However, as soon as he won, he goes into seclusion and perhaps depression from his presidential duties.  His wife and chief-of-staff do everything possible to get him back in the spotlight.  With everything failing, his COS manages to get him as a guest judge on American Dreamz.

Upon hearing this, the Middle East terrorists enlist one of their own to join the singing competition.

Meanwhile, there's one competitor who really wants to achieve the American Dream of being a singer, Sally Kendoo (Moore).  However, her boyfriend, William (Klein), wants them to get married.  Rejected, William joins the military.  Now, nothing stands in the way of Sally's dreams.

However, Sally's singing talent isn't enough for her to win.  Sally has to create ""white lies"" or do favors in order to help herself advance in the competition.  Things go awry when William returns from the military because of injuries.  He resumes his dream of marriage with Sally.

So maybe you tend to overpraise it.  Nevertheless to me it seems miles better than ABOUT A BOY or AMERICAN PIE and makes me look forward now to seeing THE GOLDEN COMPASS this winter.  OK, maybe the targets are tired (the Bush administration and AMERICAN IDOL) but throwing them together with terrorism was a good trifecta, and all in all I liked what they did with Mandy Moore, who plays Sally Kendoo in a strangely and appealingly old-fashioned way, as a character part, a character Jeanne Crain might have played for Jospeh Mankiewicz in the early 1950s, or maybe Ellen Burstyn in a 1970s Bob Rafelson film.  Sally's not a good person not really a bad person, she's just there, on the screen, sitting somewhere outside the normal range of parts for women in contemporary Hollywood film.

We see that she's greedy and fake, and worse of all she uses her boyfriend's love for you and takes it and betrays him with Hugh Grant of all people.  And yet we see she's been pushed into showbiz, Jonbenet style, by a mother who was fulfilling her own ""American Dreamz"" by using her daughter as a baby doll.  Weitz provides a devastating, brief sequence in which Jennifer Coolidge narrates a promotional segment and claims, ""Sally never had to pushed into singing, she was always on,"" but what we see is the little girl, shy, afraid, being prodded beyond endurance by adults anxious to take advantage of her cuteness.  It's the one honestly shocking moment in the movie, but it's real.

Moore looks like she gained weight, went up and down, as the script demanded?  Or was it that the script was touched up to account for the way Moore looks from reel to reel?  Whatever, this slight uncertainty gives the movie a 70s badge of ""reality,"" the authenticity of anxiety.  She doesn't look good in every scene; Sally is maybe not a natural beauty, but she can turn it on, like Jessica Simpson or Britney Spears, and thus the film, which seems to be jeering at mediocrity at every term, thus betrays a little core of sympathy with those of us who just aren't ""on"" at every second of the day.  This generosity extends all the way up to the Presidency, at which point I drew back.  Does anyone, even Weitz, believe that Bush wouldn't be Bush if he read a newspaper or a book once in his lifetime, or if he wasn't the puppet of Cheney, Rove and Rumsfeld?  Unfortunately, even if Bush took the rubber earpiece out and threw it into the night sky over Baghdad, and even if he read two books, I think he would still be the same mean old clown, but that's just me, and as you can tell, I live in San Francisco.",1185580800,,2818,4.434108527131783

I would call it silly social commentary for those who are capable of laughing at themselves - and the sad state of affairs the American Democracy has become at the moment. The most poingnant question this movie asks, almost as an aside, is this: how responsible ARE the American people for America as it exists today? The sad answer is; nobody knows. The Government is out of control, and the people are looking the other way.

You're right; the state of our democracy is not funny, but as some of our wisest entertainers know, it is much easier to make a point with humor than with pathos. Maybe if we can laugh about it we can talk about it without killing each other. I certainly hope so.

I'm a big fan of Hugh Grant. He has yet to let me down. I would call him sentimentally funny. I like that in a man.

Picture this: the final contestants are an Arab, a Jew, and an American princess - and the President of the United States is one of the final judges. Neither the President nor his Aid (who remarkably resembles Dick Cheney) portray the EVIL of the current administration - they don't dare. They have to be funny to be palatable to a movie going audience (unless the director is Michael Moore). So, these guys are funny. Go, laugh, then talk about it until you come up with something meaningful you can do about it. Then go do it. That's what democracy is all about.

Marcia Gay-Harden does a dead-on version of what I hope Laura Bush would be like, having to live with such a blow-hard fool.  A must see, as far as I'm concerned.  I have to warn you though, I laughed through the first part, and then realized of course that none of it was funny.  It was all too chillingly real to me in light of recent events.

At the end of the movie we see Dafoe's ""Cheney"" left behind by the president --and here's where we see some serious lack of teeth--and then the president blossoms from moron to an independent, intelligent, kind and resourceful president as if to say without real life Cheney, real life Bush would be awesome.

Everything about the show is very obvious, with the obnoxiousness of American Idol represented by American Dreamz, Cowell represented by Grant, etc. The marine of the movie is probably going to get the most undeserved praise/hate because he is a bumbling moron, but the movie clearly lacks the balls to say anything of the sort about the troops as a whole in such a way, so to examine the character (or anything else in this movie, for that matter) is an empty exercise. Moore does a great job of convincing us that she is an actress and not a singer, then throws it all away in an excruciating 3 minute song ""Dreamz with a Z"" (or something like that).

The movie is very obvious and brainless but fun at the same time. It doesn't ""go there;"" instead it visits the same old talking points about the current administration and the absurdity of pop culture.

1553279,4,B00005JOX5,"Paul Weitz' ""American Dreamz"" is so completely ""out there"" in both concept and execution that one can't help but give it the benefit of the doubt even when it's not always succeeding in what it's trying to do. I mean, how many comedies have the chutzpah to feature an al Qaeda terrorist cell plotting to assassinate the President of the United States on a live TV variety show modeled on ""American Idol""? And where else will you find the suave Hugh Grant playing against type as a smarmy, ego-driven Simon Cowell wannabe, Sam Golzari as an Arab suicide bomber with a passion for Broadway musicals, or Dennis Quaid as a dim bulb chief executive (based on guess who) who becomes a guest host on a television talent show in an attempt to resurrect his image with a celebrity-obsessed American public? For sheer ingenuity and audacity alone, ""American Dreamz"" far exceeds what normally passes for comedy in the multiplexes these days.

Plowing much of the same territory familiar to us from last year's ""Little Miss Sunshine"" - namely, Middle America's fixation with performing and celebrity - ""American Dreamz"" is so good-natured in its attitude and tone that it's hard to be offended by its frivolous treatment of a serious subject or its occasional lapses into the overdrawn or the obvious. The sly, clever screenplay makes fun of its characters while, at the same time, treating them with affection and respect. The George Bush parody becomes a trifle obvious and heavy-handed at times, but, for the most part, the movie doesn't push too hard to get its laughs. It may bite off a bit more than it can chew, but at least it's willing to take a few risks and not always play it safe as most movies do. And for once, thanks to the breeziness of the writing, directing and acting, and its refusal to take itself too seriously, we have a ""feel-good"" movie that actually makes us feel good.

Beyond Grant, Golzari and Quaid, the movie is filled with truly inspired comic performances by Mandy Moore as a not-quite-as-shallow-as-she-appears-to-be, aspiring singer; Jennifer Coolidge as her show business mother maniacally spurring her daughter on to dreams of fame and fortune; Seth Meyers as her sleazy agent quick to exploit any opportunity for publicity purposes; Chris Klein as her nave, sweet-natured boyfriend whose romantic declarations have the opposite effect of driving his true love further and further away from him; Tony Yalda as a flamboyant performer with dreams of making it big in the entertainment world; Willem Dafoe as a Machiavellian Karl Rove-type presidential adviser who literally plants a bug in the President's ear as a way of controlling his every move; Marcia Gay Harden as the President's wife who has her own methods for getting her man to do what she thinks ought to be done; and Shohreh Aghdashloo (so brilliant in ""The House of Sand and Fog"") as the perpetually optimistic aunt of the high-stepping, albeit reluctant suicide bomber commandeered by his fellow terrorists to take out the President (as well as himself). Without exception, all these actors more than know what their characters are about, so that we don't have to worry that the comedy is going to veer over the edge or lose sight of its mission or goal (as evidenced by its surprisingly uncompromised and uncompromising ending).

Underrated and neglected at the time of its release, ""American Dreamz"" is a gentle little satire that will tickle your funny bone while showing you a thing or two about life in this great, big, glorious, and crazy place we call America.",1176940800,,3556,4.903654485049834
1553280,5,B00005JOX5,"American Dreamz involves a collision between an uneducated and ineffectual president (played by Dennis Quaid who is made up to resemble current president Bush) and the Hollywood entertainment industry with a show run by the fabulously wealthy, shallow and hateful Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant). The movie lampoons the current Bush presidency as the president's coach and chief of staff, played by Willem Dafoe, appears remarkably like vice president Cheney. In fact, the president's wife is named Linda (almost Laura) and they sport their southern (Texas?) accents all the way through the picture. At the same time, the Hollywood entertainment industry is skewered by Hugh Grant's Martin Tweed, who resembles Simon on American Idol as he goes to extremes to get whatever he wants so that American Dreamz remains number one in the ratings.

The movie starts with the beginning of a new season of American Dreamz; and Martin Tweed calls upon his team to come up with ""some freaks"" for his American Dreamz's new season. The team picks a wide variety of some of the most unlikely game show participants; besides the types of singers that we normally see on American Idol the team also chooses a Hassidic Jew and an Arab with terrorist ties who will force him to sabotage the show in a violent way. There is also the rather superficial, bratty yet beautiful blonde bombshell Sally Kendoo, played by Mandy Moore.

We soon see a parallel in this movie: just as the president and his chief of staff want him to look good and be popular; the contestants and Martin Tweed equally crave the same things. Everyone's paths will cross when the president is booked to be a guest judge for an episode of American Dreamz when they will determine which one singer is the best of all the contestants.

The action takes place as the contestants warm up for the show and experience the elimination process. It gets whittled down and as this happens we begin to wonder more and more what will happen: Will the Arab, Omer, become so comfortable in his American home that he no longer wishes to sabotage the show--or will he be true to his sleeper cell and cause incredible harm and chaos? What about Omer's cousin, a superstar wannabe?  When his thunder is stolen because the show picks his cousin Omer (Sam Golzari) to be a contestant, will he want revenge? AND, what about the president who is booked to be a guest judge on the same show where there could be violence? No spoilers here, folks; you'll have to watch the movie to find out.

Unfortunately, what could have been an excellent comedy just doesn't do the trick. Some jokes and themes will amuse you, as in the beginning when Omer's cousin is kicked out of a terrorist training camp because he is not aggressive and listens to American show tunes at night in his tent. Other themes and jokes remain only half-baked, including the idea that the president must wear a hearing device so that his chief of staff can whisper the ""correct"" answers into it for him to say.

As one reviewer notes, the film takes sharp aim at American Idol as Martin Tweed of American Dreamz makes up fake sob stories for his show's contestants like Mandy Moore's Sally Kendoo. They use her boyfriend, William Williams (played by Chris Klein), as a puppet for her to appear to be a very appealing contestant to vote for to be the sole survivor of American Dreamz. It's great to see Martin Tweed's results for his sleazy style and ruthlessness; but you may feel differently about the way things work out for William Williams.

The casting was well done but the script lacks punch.

Overall, American Dreamz does the job up to a point as you will see in the first half or so of the movie; but the ending just doesn't measure up to be what it could have been. Other reviewers seem to agree with me; although some may say that it was the middle part that dragged or they may write that something else didn't work right. The bottom line is that American Dreamz is an average comedy that's good for some laughs and a little diversion for an hour and a half. American Dreamz does not take itself too seriosuly and it wasn't trying to be comedy of the year, either. While it will relieve you from the stresses of everyday life for about an hour and one-half, I doubt that you'll want to go back and watch this one over and over again.",1175385600,,4335,4.628088426527959
1553325,5,B00005JOX5,"This movie was promoted as a satire on American Idol and President Bush, but I don't really think it really is a satire.  Its portrayal of the President is both comic and sympathetic, as is its portrayal of the American Idol contestants.  So because it's not consistently cutting, if you start viewing the movie thinking that that's what you want, you'll be disappointed.

But if you go into watching this movie thinking it's about what the title says it's about--American Dream(z)--you'll really enjoy it.  You have Hugh Grant playing the Simon Cowell character, who already has his dream--the big ratings and the big show and yet he hates himself at the same time.  You have Mandy Moore's character, Sally Kendoo, who basically wants the big time and will stop at nothing to get it, just like the Hugh Grant character (which is why Hugh's character becomes obsessed with her relentlessness).  Then there's the loveable contestant Omar, who joined a terror cell because his mother was killed by an American bomb, but who really wants to sing show tunes because that's the music she used to share with him.  Plus the soldier-boyfriend of Sally Kendoo, who has as his dream marriage to a nice, beautiful girl-next-door Sally that doesn't really exist.  And then there's the President, in the middle of a nervous breakdown, whose dream is to be able to say what he thinks (if he can figure out what he thinks) and not what his adviser is telling him to say.  This is thematically how it seems to hang together to me, and I think if you think of it that way and don't come into it with irrational expectations of satire, you'll see how great it works and enjoy it.

The performances are all spot-on, across the board, and I enjoyed it even as a politically conservative non-American-Idol watcher.  Unusually for a comedy it does not have a categorically ""happy go lucky"" ending.  For that reason I give it five stars for originality (though it's probably more fair to assign four stars on substance).",1172620800,,1997,4.756521739130434
1553326,3,B00005JOX5,"I have to confess I enjoyed this - but it's quite a guilty pleasure, as it's hard to find the merit in it..  Everyone seems to be trying hard to lampoon real life.  Dennis Quaid IS Pres Bush... Willem Defoe IS Dick Cheney... Hugh Grant IS Simon Cowell... and the humour is mostly found in recognising the lampooning that is going on.  However the potential for biting satire is largely thrown away... it's still there, but not so biting (Defoe, at a press conference describes the recent visit from the Russian premier - `The president and Mr. Putin had a nice talk. The president considers him a close friend, while of course deeply mistrusting his undemocratic tendencies.').  This makes for a movie where the characters are for the most part either stupid or unlikable - mostly both.

And yet, when the ingredients are put together and we have a talent show with a failed Arab terrorist who just wants to sing, a budding starlet who will do anything to be famous (even her name is `Kandoo') and the MC is one of the most loathable and self loathing characters in years - the end result is amusing, and even in some cases surprising.  But the reliance on current issues means that a year or more from now this movie is already going to look dated..

1553328,3,B00005JOX5,"Okay, it's not that bad, but this movie is so uneven at times that you end up crossing your eyes on several occasions.  I laughed a few times, but it was because of good actors who took the little they had to work with and made some of the film work in small spots.

If you detest shows like American Idol or the horrible latest offering of Grease:  You're the One that I Want (which one viewing was 90 minutes of my life I will never get back), that premise alone will make you laugh.  Mandy Moore's Sally Kendoo is just so much of the overhyped Carrie Underwood type of character that is supposed to be everybody's darling, but you actually hate because of the undeserved hype not given to genuine talents who have been struggling for years.  As much as I tend to like Moore in spurts, this is one time I can't stand her, or perhaps it's that annoying character.  The extra with her is as painfully lacking in humor as her performance, and it's a shame because she is a real talent.  It's time she utilize it more proficiently than in movies like this or her last couple of bombs.

What's funny is Hugh Grant as the Simon of the show, because he is so very good at playing bitter, cocky English guys.  Dennis Quaid and Marcia Gay Harden are funny as thinly disguised versions of the Bush's, but this semi-conservative thought it got to being overly caricaturized.  Willem Dafoe was NOT funny, and if this show was supposed to be an American Idol spoof, how did a dopey Broadway loving terrorist get to be in the semi-finals?  Of course, that's what is in itself funny.  Why they didn't give his name a mention on the box since a great deal of the plot revolves around his character is a mystery, so I have to maintain that the only true reason for sitting through this entire mess is Tony Yalba who plays cousin Iqbal.  He is very funny in his attitude and demeanor, and I hope to see more of him in better films, because he's proven himself to be a strong supporting character actor.

I can recommend far better movies than this one that spoof some form of entertainment genre like Spinal Tap, but if you despise alleged ""talent"" shows, try American Dreamz to see just how much better an amateur script writer can do than Paul Weitz and his tribe.  A few good jokes and some good actors only merits this movie 2.5 stars in my book, but Ammy doesn't let us do 1/2 pointers.  Rent it before buying PLEASE!",1168646400,,2406,4.373033707865169

The president of the United States, along with a guy who is supposed to be Simon Cowell played by Hugh Grant, a chubby Mandy Moore and a bumbling al-Qaeda recruit. Seriously. Then they all take turns eating as much Ex-Lax as they can stomach. Then they take some naps and wake up and eat some more. That ends Act One.

Act two is just all of the characters shooting diarrhea into five-gallon buckets. Some of it is very brown, but after a while it just becomes clear liquid. They fill up a bunch of buckets like this, on and on for forty-five minutes, until they have hundreds of gallons of diarrhea sitting in buckets. They put the buckets out in the sun and then Act 2 closes.

Act three is wierd, because the al-Qaeda operative is one of the finalists on the show ""American Dreamz,"" which is supposed to be American Idol. Hugh Grant and The President of the USA are judging the final showdown between al-Qaeda and Chubby Mandy Moore. No, seriously. Then comes a big, audience participation surprise. Pretty innovative. The doors of the movie theater wer flung open and employees of the movie studio came filing in with the buckets of diarrhea from the second Act. They had long straws they used to suck up mouthfuls of the diarrhea and then they took turns spitting it at the audience for an additional 30 minutes.

1553331,3,B00005JOX5,"The relations drawn between reality and this movie are razor-thin and very obvious. Surprisingly, that doesn't stop them from being funny.

Here's the basic plot: The morning after winning reelection Dennis Quaid's version of George W. Bush decides that he's going to start reading the newspapers. When he realizes how much he doesn't know and how much his ""intelligence reports"" leave out he goes into seclusion, telling Willem Dafoe's Karl Rove/Dick Cheney hybrid: ""Iran and North Korea are NOT like Magneto and Dr. Octopus!""

Meanwhile, a new season of the extremely popular reality show American Dreamz has begun, and the host (Hugh Grant's acerbic version of Simon Cowell), wants it to be more interesting, so he searches for an Arab and a Jew to put into the competition. Mandy Moore's combination of Carrie Underwood and every other marginally talented singer who's been on a reality show, is also part of the competition.

The President needs to get his approval ratings back up so he signs on to be a guest host of the show.

There you go. There are some pretty solid laughs throughout, and the movie never tries to take itself too seriously which helps to keep it rolling. In the end, there may be too many characters and too many plot points for the story to really be cohesive, but it's not the kind of movie audiences are expecting to really learn something from anyway.

In the opening scene, Hugh Grant tells his girlfriend. ""You make me want to be a better man. But I'm not a better man. I'm me."" This movie has the same unapologetic attitude. ""You make me want to be a better movie. But I'm not a better movie. I'm American Dreamz."" And that's okay.",1166400000,,1666,4.711340206185567
1553332,3,B00005JOX5,"I, of all people, am certainly open to the idea of a connection between the Iraq War, ""American Idol,"" and our brain dead president. My version goes something like this: The complacency of an American public that has been seduced by a game show has allowed our leader to lead us into a disastrous war. The problem with ""American Dreamz"" is that the dots are not connected as well as they should have been. The opposite of nimble, this film rambles all over the political and cultural fabric of America mowing down anything in its path. The president of this universe President Staton (Dennis Quaid) has just been re-elected for a second term. But his sudden discovery of the magic of the written word has caused him to bunker himself down and go on an all out learning binge. This is bad for his chief of staff (Willem Dafoe) who has to field questions from a feisty press (wouldn't it be nice) and who is concerned that the president might start thinking for himself. So he books him as a guest judge on ""American Dreamz,"" an ""American Idol"" stand in. This is good news for the terrorists who see the opportunity to get one of their own into the final round and use a suicide bomb to blow Staton away. The script, unfortunately, needs a minor makeover as the film is OK, but also bloated and weak.

Most of director Chris Weitz' venom is aimed at ""American Idol."" He portrays it as an overwhelmingly fake spectacle where the manufactured image of a poor country girl (Mandy Moore in a performance she can finally be proud of) who makes out with a puppeted war vet (Chris Klein, perfectly cast) is enough to win the hearts of America. And it is all hauntingly true. A culture of insta-celebrity has infected out country where the ""Most Popular"" award is now given out before the contestants even do anything, and is only given to the one with the best agent. The film itself is high gloss. But it is also an attack on everything that people who like high gloss entertainment hold dear. Hugh Grant riffing on Ryan Seacrest is mildly amusing, but ultimately only so so.

Giving this film a thumbs down brings me no pleasure. It is brave and wants to change the way people think. The climax scores in a big way. It wants us to know, as ""Little Miss Sunshine"" also did, that the whole world is just one big beauty pageant. Still, the script was all over the map. Too many storylines in this particular kitchen. The middle section seems to go on forever. I would also say that they reached a point of overkill in the department of drawing parallels between Staton and Bush. I get it, they are the same thing, but parallels aren't comedy all by themselves. Finally, I just didn't find it to be in good taste to let the ""America Idol"" audience off the hook in the end. Yes, I agree, as silly as it is, the outrageous singing and dancing show does have the ability to bring the world closer together. Fame and fortune are pretty much universal. But the people that watch it are the same ones who truly are terrified (and manipulated) by the clips of terrorists on the monkey bars. And they are the ones who have allowed the Iraq War to continue on, unchecked, because the singing and dancing show constituted a higher priority for them. Why not call them out for being the enablers that they are? ***",1166313600,4,3292,4.485

1553383,4,B00005JOX5,"President Joseph Staton (Dennis Quaid) sees the world as a fairly black-and-white place, but a glance at the daily headlines on the eve of his reelection leaves the most powerful man in the free world shaken to the very core. Upon reading this, Staton locks himself in his bedroom boning up on information, which causes concern for his chief of staff (Willem Dafoe) and first lady/wife (Marcia Gay Harden). Eventually, Staton finds himself booked on his favorite show, ""American Dreams"", hosted by the cynical Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant). The event is in favor of two contestants, Sally Kendoo (Many Moore) and Omer (Sam Golzari). But one of them has a dark secret that will ensure a season finale no one will soon forget.

With ""American Dreams,"" Paul Weitz is finding himself in a new direction. Known for movies about getting past first base (""American Pie""), childish adults who want kids (""About a Boy""), and wounded egos in the workplace (""In Good Company""), the director is now moving into satirical comedy. Sure, we've been down this road before (on ""SNL"" and ""MadTV""), but with a potent comedy agenda and good talent involved, ""American Dreamz"" manages to entertain.

Recently, critics are after this movie because of some poor satirical targets, such as ""American Idol"" and the fact that our president is a boob. Agreed, because we had ""MadTV,"" ""South Park,"" ""Saturday Night Live,"" and a dozen other shows that have tackled these subjects. Of course, it doesn't help matters if you have overexposed ""SNL"" celeb Seth Meyers in your cast (though he does bring up a funny Britney Spears reference). And the movie takes a downfall when it reaches dramatic portions, such as terrorists forcing Omer to blow himself and the president up.

Weitz does get help from his cast. Like with all his recent movies, ""Dreamz"" benefits from a strong ensemble cast. The highlight of this movie is former(?) teen pop starlet Mandy Moore. She fills her character with naivet charms (think Piper Perabo of ""Coyote Ugly"" without all the lame clichd drama), and some doses of humor. It's very good stuff.

Rounding out the cast is some familiar Weitz cast members - Dennis Quaid puts a southern drawl for Staton, Hugh Grant is wonderfully cynical as Martin Tweed, and Chris Klein is always up for a laugh as Sally's b/f. It's a shame the same can't be said for John Cho, Jennifer Coolidge, Judy Greer, Marcia Gay Harden, and others, as none of them have a lot to do in this movie.

""Dreamz"" kind of runs in the similar category as any ""SNL"" Weekend Update you've seen: sophomoric play-it-safe potshots at the president, making you wonder if Tina Fey was uncredited with writing the screenplay. Still, if your cast has some likable talent like Grant, Moore, and Quaid, maybe it doesn't matter that much. And Willem Dafoe's good as the Dick Cheney look-a-like, so why complain?",1164412800,5,2860,4.8765432098765435

Hugh Grant is perfect as the self centered egotistical host and producer of TV's most popular show, ""American Dreamz.""  Grant has this kind of snootiness down to an art and he's quite effective.  A surprisingly competent performance from teen star Msndy Moore as the coquettish but talented singer who will do anything to win the grand prize; Dennis Quaid is marvelous as the disillusioned president whose PR director (Willem Defoe looking a lot like Henry Fonda) tries to raise the president's popularity by making him the guest host for the show's finals; Sam Golari is very good as the planted terrorist whose success as the show's ""novelty""(i.e., untalented) singer/dancer is perfect for the mission to kill the president on live T.V.; Chris Klein is Moore's lovestruck boyfriend whose war injury helps improve Moore's chances of winning, and whose final act is ironically appropriate.  Jennifer Coolidge and Marcia Gay Harden are good as Moore's mother and Quaid's first lady respectively.

Now while it is obvious that Chris Weitz has his views and he makes them known I don't think it's with an agenda to make a heavy and sharp satirical film based on them.  I think he was just making fun of what is so ludacris in our society.  The remarkable and yet sad situation we have with American Idol drawing way more votes than a presidential election and its mass hysteria is made fun of and so is the situation with a current administration.  But I think that is all he is doing, is just making fun of it and getting his little pokes and takes on the situation himself.  I don't think its a sharp satire thats meant to cut.  And I don't think it was suppose to be, I think he's just exposing the stupidity of both of the subjects and how ridiculous he thinks it is.  All that aside, the performances are fun to watch.

1553387,2,B00005JOX5,"I'll admit, the first time that the Al-Queda training camp came into the film, I was like... HUH? What has this got to do with an AMERICAN IDOL spoof?

Many have criticized that there is nothing funny about Al-Queda, but I disagree. This is the ONE THING that American Dreamz does right. When Omer Obeidi (Sam Golzari) is sent to America because he's caught dancing and singing to show tunes in his tent, he's mostly being cast away as a sleeper cell terrorist, never to be actually used. So, when he's mistakenly spotted by the casting directors of AMERICAN DREAMZ and put on a show that will be guest-judged by the President of the United States, his terrorist brothers come calling.

Ultimately, it's not a bad move to poke fun at Al-Queda. AMERICAN DREAMZ points out what Al-Queda terrorists are missing out on... singing, dancing, the thrill of friendly competition and most importantly, the celebration of LIFE. So, when the Al-Queda leader is watching the show in Afghanistan and comments, ""Oh, he killed that!"" It's effectively funny and makes you kind of wish that they would celebrate life a little bit, instead of celebrating the afterlife.

In fact, there are a lot of good things about AMERICAN DREAMZ. The terrorist who come to visit Omer and sit in the swimming pool, or gathering around eating pizza while they watch AMERICAN DREAMZ intently. Not to mention, MANDY MOORE is excellent as the ruthless, win or else Sally Kendoo. Oh, and Omer's cousin Iqbal Riza (Tony Yalda) is tremendously funny.

Where AMERICAN DREAMZ falls short for me is with the show itself. The movie is ment to be a spoof of AMERICAN IDOL, yet, the show is not explored fully. Where is the behind the scenes cat fights? The competition? The preparation? The attitudes? They skip from the opening episode of AMERICAN DREAMZ into a montage and we're in the final 3 before you know it.

Ultimately, the AMERICAN DREAMZ show is very very cheesy and CHEAP. Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant) sits in a chair making silly comments to the contestants. The performances are cheesy. The songs are cheesy. And not cheesy in a funny way. I mean, couldn't the tremendously wealthy and hugely successful UNIVERSAL STUDIOS shell out some money and get some REAL songs to spoof?

I'm surprised that Mandy Moore sang some of these goofy songs... ""American Dreams... dreams with a z."" Z for zzzzz. Does she not have some songs in the can that she never used on her albums?

1553391,2,B00005JOX5,"The 21st century has become known for its addiction to reality TV shows. They're everywhere! Here in the UK, we have more than our fair share, and we can even get to see American Idol, cos they show that over here now as well. And no sooner does one end, then it's all over the press that there's another one coming. When one ends, you wonder what to do with your spare time now; when a new one starts, you wonder how you're gonna fit it around your busy social life.

I can quite happily talk about this, cos I am a reality TV show addict. But I managed to impress even myself this summer, when during the seventh series of Big Brother, I went on holiday and never bothered about it. When I got home, I didn't really bother with it, apart from the eviction shows. I still love the X-Factor & American Idol, although I'm not that much of an addict that I'll vote for who I want to win. I've done it once during the entire Big Brother run.

Sooner or later, there was going to be a film based on a reality TV show. And one comes out based on American Idol, with Hugh Grant playing the one & only judge (Simon Cowell!) They're playing on the premise that more people voted in American Idol than actually voted in the last American election. And those people who DID vote in the last American election, voted for the wrong guy.

There's some strange actors appearing in this, who you wouldn't initally expect to appear. Hugh Grant appears as himself (again); Dennis Quaid as the going-off-the-rails unpredictable president, and Willem Dafoe as his amazing Chief of Staff. That is the role that most astounded me. He is virtually unrecognisable, and has been aged by about 20-30 years. (What a surreal experience that must be!) He really should have more screen time.

Most of the film is very boring. It basically rehashes the same old from the TV show, but makes it LONGER. And then just when you think you can't take it anymore, they do a musical segment, and crush too much into too little time, backed by a cliched song.

I don't think American Dreamz is a ballsy or brave movie, as some other reviewers have mentioned. It is trying to get laughs out of suicide bombers, or the situation that was in Iraq. It's not funny. Why is there a film out that is making light of this? Innocent people have died because of suicide bombers, and the director of this thought it would be fun.

Mandy Moore is alright in this I guess, she's perfect for the role, as she's previously been there, done that, battled Britney. She ends up looking a lot like Kelly Clarkson during some of the scenes (the original American Idol winner) and completely mocks some of the most recent contestants (Carrie Underwood anyone?)

American Dreamz had an alright ending, but you have to sit through over an hour of film to get to that ending, and even then you feel like it's a copout. It's also a bare bones DVD, with no extras. Not even a trailer. So pick it up really cheap if you can, otherwise give it a miss.",1162857600,,2985,4.406533575317605

It's definitely an ""elitist"" work,  and the highly ironical,  alienated tone is not going to be for everyone. Remember,  the Weill-Brecht ""Threepenny Opera"",  a satire of capitalism,  flopped in America ca. 1930,  and only became an off-Broadway hit 25 years later.....

An irony within the irony of ""American Dreamz"" is that the putative Arabs and Arab Americans look to me to be mainly Persians and Pakistanis,  as though real Arabs would not be ""other"" or ""different"" enough for this kind of satire.

A terrorist plot, by a gang of terrorists, who have no problem coming to American, and being shallow enough to be fans of one of the lamest American traditions?  And weren't these the same terrorists who were disgusted by our Hero's singing in their home country?

I thought the American-Afghani female was totally bangin' and enjoyed her sexiness while she was onscreen.  I thought the male cousin was a little bit too flaming for me.

I would not recommend buying this movie, but a rental might be in order for some.

Just a'iiiight.

1553445,3,B00005JOX5,"Personally I was really looking forward to this film.  I wanted to see it in the theaters but never got around to it.  Last night my wife and I sat down to enjoy what I thought would be endless laughs but instead were left wanting, really wanting.  No, this film is not by any means terrible, but it lacks the pure comedic timing that was promised by the previews.  Yes, the reviews for the film were somewhat all over the place, but I never listen to critics anyways.

High Grant was probably the best part of the film, as he always shines as the morally ambiguous pr*ck.  Mandy Moore was also delightful, as she is always, but I did feel that her performance was far from her best.  This film really takes more of a crack at the current President then American Idol.  This is the film Bush DOES NOT WANT YOU TO SEE.  As a matter of fact, Dennis Quaid is pretty good here, especially towards the end when on the show and he says ""turn that freaking thing off"" and then looks at Hugh as if he didn't do anything wrong...priceless.

So the plot is so much different then I expected it to be.  There are terrorist that plan to kill the president during the finale of American Dreamz and they use show tune loving Omer to do it.  The cast for the most part does a fine job; Dafoe (who I normally can't stand) takes on the Cheney role quite nicely, but as always, the main comedic timing fell on the part of the token gay guy played by Tony Yalda.  As Omer's cousin Iqbal, Tony plays the horrible dancer/singer who dreams of stardom and who everyone mocks in ridicule.  Hilarious.

Anyways, here I've gone a praised it but I must add that although there are funny moments, they are for the most part sprinkled in amidst generic teen comedy fluff and it never really becomes it's own film.  So, to quote Martin Tweed... ""Am I lovable?""...not really, but I did `like' you if that makes you feel any better.",1162166400,,1900,4.339943342776204
1553446,5,B00005JOX5,"An absoultey biting, cruel satire on the America of today, ""American Dreamz"" is the funniest film I've seen this year. It revolves around an America similar to today. One obsessed with lame reality television, celebrity and pop culture. Because of these things, the public has elected a looser president who listens to too many advisors who confuse him a great deal.

As the host of the reality TV show, also called American Dreamz (an American Idol-esque cheese fest), Hugh Grant is a hillarious mix of Ryan Seacrest and Simon Cowell. However, the charming host face is removed in many of his scenes where he plays a depressed, cynic. Mandy Moore, as the popular songstress on the series also does very well. Her competitor, an Iraqi showtune lover is hillarious and touching at the same time.

On the political side, Dennis Quaid sends up George W. Bush in a deadpan manner. An absolutley stunning performance. As a Cheney-esque Cheif of Staff, William Dafoe is cruel and funny.

Paul Weitz should be commended for writing and directing a film that is absolutely wonderful. People just don't get it, which is understandable, since it's ahead of its time in a way. However, I got it and and I loved it!",1162080000,2,1203,4.8019323671497585

The scenes were quick, and didn't have enough material for it to go anywhere. One second your seeing the auditions and the next the finals are there, it really is that quick. For a comedy I fount that all comedy was lacking from the movie, I laughed a couple times tops.

The whole movie was a disappointment, it either tried to hard or didn't try hard enough, whatever it was. It didn't work.",1161820800,,534,4.287128712871287

It accurately depicts the state of American culture:  the love of realty TV, the callousness of our fellow Americans, and the emptiness of our president it is ironic this is the downfall of this comedy.  It is hard to laugh at what we know to be true . . . more people do vote in American Idol than in a presidential election.  And we are too lackadaisical and complacent we are numb to how shameful that makes us as a country.  The flix is dead-on; maybe (hopefully) in 5 or 10 years it would have been a hysterical perspective of us in in `00s, but we do not want to see fiction this real right now.",1161475200,,641,4.178861788617886

The humor is anything but subtle, but Willem DaFoe and Dennis Quaid doing Cheney and Bush, respectively, are hilariously on point, and Mandy Moore is quite wonderful as a composite Idol diva.  Lots of good supporting talent, more than a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a reasonably engaging plot, add up to a fun couple of hours and even a scintilla of political profundity.  Idol fans will find lots to enjoy, but it works even without all the Idol in-jokes.",1161388800,2,671,4.868421052631579
1553450,2,B00005JOX5,"AMERICAN DREAMZ is a pitiful mess of a movie, a film that seems as though it wants to be a satire on the Bush administration, on talk show hosts, and on our current state of mindless entertainment that seems to keep high ratings and low IQs neck and neck.

The story, what little there is, involves a bored talent show host (Hugh Grant, who looks very down in the tooth) desperate to get out of his mindless role, and hungry for people who are over the edge to come on his popular show and make fools of themselves. He manages to accomplish this from some rather innocent folks as well as the President of the United States (GWB imitator Dennis Quaid, Laura Bush imitator Marcia Gay Harden, and Cheney imitator Willem Dafoe).  Along the way we meet some fragments of characters portrayed by some fine actors who bought into this venture belonging to Paul Weitz for some unknown reason: Mandy Moore, Jennifer Coolidge, a promising Sam Golzari, Chris Klein, Seth Meyers, and  Shohreh Aghdashloo.

Satire can be one of the finest forms of art, but it requires a very intelligent script. That missing element is what drives this very unfunny carcass into the dumpster!  Grady Harp, October 06",1161388800,,1188,4.6923076923076925

1553452,3,B00005JOX5,"I enjoyed this movie more than I expected to.  More than just a send-up of currently popular game shows (American Idol is more game show than a reality show, really), the subplots really make the movie.  Some of it is predictable - the cold, egomaniacal producer who wants ""freaks"" to make good TV, the cute but ruthless small-town girl, etc, but what moves the film along are the parts unrelated to the show - the president of the US coming into his own, the failed terrorist turned contest.

The actors seem to be having fun, the movie is easy to watch and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. The extras are a little much, but occasionally interesting.",1161043200,,651,4.547008547008547

It was pretty flat until the last 20 minutes, when they pull all of the stops and go for broke with great results. Hugh Grant was fabulously smarmy, Chris Klein played the patheticness of his character to the hilt, and Mandy Moore's shrieking was like nails on the chalkboard.

I mean, the Middle East is royally screwed up! Suicide bombers here, kidnappings there, yet ""American Idol"" is on the airwaves! Are we living in a crazy world or what? ""American Dreamz"" makes us look at the current world situation and laugh at its absurdity. A really wonderful movie.

about how far a movie can go in satirizing America's myths.  When before have we seen the President of the United States on happy pills and robotically programmed by his Rove-like handlers?

Could our love affair with American Idol be an escape from the collapse of the American middle class way of life?

When the public begins to question his ability to lead the country, his Chief of Staff (Defoe) gets the president an appearance as a guest judge on the finals of the hit show ""American Dreamz"".

""American Dreamz"" is hosted by Martin Tweed (Grant).  He is trapped by the show, hoping for failure just so it will end.  Then he sees Sally Kendoo (Moore).  In her he sees a like-minded person.  He gets her onto the show, and she is easily the best of the bunch.  Another notable contestant is Omar (Golzari), a terrorist sent to America to get him out of the more capable terrorist's way.  Of course he is now in a position to do some serious damage, if only he did not like singing so much.

""American Dreamz"" has some potential, but never really accomplishes much.  Quaid and Grant channel their inner-Bush and inner-Simon Cowell, but it takes more than just two good impersonations to make a movie good.  Much of the story falls flat or feels unbelievable.  The ending is a prime example of this.  I would say that I was disappointed with this movie, but the previews did not exactly get my hopes up.

Weitz uses these easy targets for send-ups, while (again) attempting to make us like stupid and unlikable characters. While this worked in ABOUT a BOY and his AMERICAN PIE series of films, it is awkward at best, and he has greatest success with his show tune loving-would-be-terrorist, OMER. Let me explain...

...the story begins when President Staton (Dennis Quaid) wakes up one morning and decides, for the first time, to read the newspaper. He awakens to the possibilities of an outside world. Meanwhile, the self-absorbed host of TV's talent contest ""American Dreamz,"" Martin Tweed (Hugh Grant), about to start another season, he demands to have an Arab represented on the show. His call is answered by, Omer (Sam Golzari), a less than enthusiastic terrorist ""sleeper"" dumped for incompetence and sent to the U.S. to live with family waiting for his orders. The future ""American Dreamz"" winner, Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore), callously prepares for her future in showbiz by keeping her dim ex-boyfriend (Chris Klein) only to win votes. Willem Dafoe as a Cheney-looking Vice President,  works to get the President, & the States, back under control, give Staton ""happy pills"" and making him wear an earpiece when speaking in public. As part of a PR blitz the President will make a guest appearance on ""American Dreamz"" in a painfully contrived connecting of characters.  Weitz spends much of the movie attempting to humanizing these quirky stereotypes, the President starts to look like a nice, but spaced-out guy, along with the First-lady (Marcia Gay Harden), while even the shallow Sally and cynical Martin are revealed to be lonely behind their Hollywood facades.

In the end the movie falls short, after all the character tinkering Weitz fails to make a cohesive story. He supplies lots of interesting performances and interesting characters like: Tony Yalda as Iqbal, the flamboyantly gay cousin who helps with Omer's TV image; Jennifer Coolidge as Sally Mom, Chris Klein as Sally's boyfriend, Dafoe's VP has some great scene with the Staton as does Sam Golzari as the ""Omerizing"" contestant who may or may not win or blow-up the Prez.  The movie's strength lies in the bashing of iconic sterotypes, from TV and from the general public, more concerned with reality TV voting than voting in a presidential election, in fact it is the movie's tagline. Another strength of the film is the energy used pointing out items made off limits for questioning or discussion, no matter how obvious, like the President blurting out that the War was a bad idea.
