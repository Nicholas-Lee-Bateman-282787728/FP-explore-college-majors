6853274,5,B00Q2OKOLI,My ultimate favorite of Hritrik Roshan. My Favorite India actor. Great action flick. A remake of Night and Day and so much better acting and of course the excellant dancing and singing made it even that much better.  Movie played well and the transaction was also very good.,1420761600,,274,4.708333333333333
6853275,5,B00Q2OKOLI,"Well done, fun to watch film.  Hrithik and Katrina at their Bollywood best.",1420329600,2,75,4.769230769230769
6853276,5,B00Q2OKOLI,"What if James Bond was played by Hrithik Roshan, the sexiest man alive?  What if, as well as being adept with the quip and karate kick, he was also a thrilling dancer, and dearly loved his Mum and Dad?  Then, you would have the peerless escapism of the Bollywood action film, Bang Bang.  An international terrorist has commissioned a theft, of the Kohinoor diamond, once looted to grace the crown of the Empress of India, Britains Queen Victoria.  Rajveer (Hrithik) has the gem, but is distracted by the lovely Harleen (Katrina Kaif) a bored bank receptionist waiting for a Truluvv.com date, and who is about to embark on her personal thrill ride.  There are spectacular chases (at least one too many) and copious carnage, and Harleen is a bit dimmer than she needs to be, but shes a real character.  Bang Bang isn't high art, but pop art, an exhilarating ride.

World cinema has been stealing from Hollywood since practically the beginning of the movies, I presume. The Indianization of Hollywood films is fascinating and ongoing, and this one is an excellent study of the tradition. Now, globalized companies, like Fox, have begun to formalize the once shadowy arrangement.  Bang Bang is a riff on the Tom Cruise/Cameron Diaz Knight and Day from 2010.  The basic plot is a favorite of mine, innocent bystander becomes entangled with wild adventure.  I saw Bang Bang before the Tom Cruise/Cameron Diaz starrer although some theater screenings included a title card acknowledging the source.  My theater in North Carolina omitted this slide, which apparently credited the original screenwriters.  Also missing were the opening slides plugging brand partners, like Pizza Hut.  There are ludicrous Pizza Hut product placements throughout Bang Bang.  Im willing to bet there is no stand alone, cliff side Pizza Hut restaurant in Deradhun, a plug obvious to the most naive moviegoer.

The film begins with a shadowy figure casually tossing and catching the Kohinoor in the air.  Since that person has a double thumb, it can only be Hrithik Roshan, an actors whose physical beauty is accented by this oddity, considered lucky and so uncorrected by plastic surgery. A chance encounter sets both film's plots in motion, but the characterizations are tailored to each stars persona.  Tom Cruise has a driven, type A kind of charm, hes anxious and rabbity, never relaxed.  Hrithiks manner is much looser, hes much more willing to smile, and the camera lingers on his body, for visual pleasure, more like the way Diaz is ogled in a bikini, rather than Cruise in his board shorts .  Hrithiks dancing skills play into his fighting skills, he has a longer line, as one would say of a ballerina, and appears to be doing more of his own stunting than Cruise (whos older).

Cameron Diazs heroines are always rather tomboyish, June, in Knight and Day, wears her cowgirl boots, even with a bridesmaids dress. In Night and Day she is a garage owner, a rebuilder of 60s/70s muscle cars. Katrina Kaif, the leading lady of Bang Bang is not a physically small person.  Much taller and more solid than Diaz, her character is more fragile and nave.  I thought Kaif did way too much shrieking, but it turns out Diaz did even more.  Diaz is more sexually aggressive, as well, Katrina is dumbfoundingly sexually innocent, although her robust fantasies about Rajveer take up a lot of the musical real estate of the film.

The villain, Omar Zaphir, is played by Danny Denzongpa, who is himself a link to classic Bollywood action films of the 1970s.  An actor of Nepalese descent, his non-Indian looks suited him for all kinds of action film bad behavior during his long career. He has 195 credits, according to the imdb, dating back to 1971. His henchman, Hamid Gul, is Javed Jaffrey, often a comedy player, its fun to see him be evil here.

Mainstream Bollywood film actors did not kiss their leading ladies even ten years ago.  When Hrithik first kissed on screen, in Dhoom 2 and his lips touched Aishwarya Rais, the theater audience gasped in amazement.  Kissing is a big deal in Hindi films, and what in American movies would be considered ridiculously chaste, here carries an erotic charge, as it still has an aura of the forbidden.

Needless to say, Knight and Day is not a musical (although the Kingsmens Louie, Louie figures in both films). Bang Bangs songs, by the peerless Vishal and Shekar, are driving and catchy.  Bang Bangs title song, played over the end credits (and no doubt, endlessly on South Asian television channels) is loads of fun, with its homage to Michael Jackson.  But all the songs are good, and nobody looks better on the dance floor than Hrithik.  Nobody.

One huge problem with Fox being directly involved, and this is true as other Indian production companies partner with American studios, they have stopped subtitling the songs.  Whats up with that, people?  The lyrics are important.  Yes, both versions are loaded with action movie ridiculousness.  So many bullets, and the lead actors never get hit?  As my daughter points out, Rajveer clearly has a supply of hair products in each of his safe houses.  But, for some reason, Bang Bangs craftsmen and women improve on the source material.  A lesson in cultural appropriation, alluring star personas and audience satisfaction. This is the best Bollywood entertainer of 2014.",1420243200,11,5330,4.878888888888889
6853277,5,B00Q2OKOLI,I love the movie.. H Roshan and K Kaif are awesome! Asian James Bond!!,1419724800,,70,4.071428571428571
6853278,5,B00Q2OKOLI,"Action!  Romance!  Comedy!  Adventure! - all, brilliantly united in the whirlwind delight that is ""Bang Bang!"" (2014).

Perhaps not since Spielberg's classic ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1978) have these elements of action and romance and comedy been so seamlessly and slickly melded together ... simultaneously, at the same time and in the same scenes.

A bright-but-bored bank receptionist (Katrina Kaif) inadvertently saves the life of a charming stranger (Hrithik Roshan) - who may be `Mr Right' but is also literally `The Wrong Guy' - then must flee around the world with him to evade international criminals (Danny Denzongpa and Jaaved Jaaferi) and government agents (Pavan Malhotra), who assume they are working together and are now trying to kill them both.

""Bang Bang!"" can be appreciated as a triumph of globalisation in cinema because it is, truly, an international collaboration.  The action team alone brought together experts from 6 countries (India, US, UK, France, UAE, and Iran) under the direction of veteran Hollywood action specialist Andy Armstrong (""Thor"", ""The Amazing Spider-Man"", and many others) from the UK, who had nothing but raves for Indian superstar actor Hrithik Roshan's stunt work.  Locations range the planet, from snow in the Himalayas and sand-and-surf in both Thailand and Greece, desert in Abu Dhabi, all the way to Baroque grandeur in Prague.  ""Bang Bang!"" is the first major project of Fox Star Studios, the new Indian subsidiary of classic Hollywood studio 20th Century Fox, which adapts an earlier Fox property shot as ""Knight and Day"" (fully credited) into this more polished movie designed for the international market.  And frankly?  ""Bang Bang!"" makes ""Knight and Day"" look like a half-finished rough draft.  The skeleton is retained, but fleshed out and fully grown.  Everything works better!  Director Siddarth Anand uses a sharp screenplay, crisp editing, and witty dialogues to elevate the proven chemistry of reigning superstars Hrithik Roshan & Katrina Kaif (whose first pairing in 2011's ""Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara"" was hugely appreciated) to a whole new level altogether.  The result smacks less of ""Knight and Day"" and more the wit and sheer fun of the early James Bond movies - or ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"".

One quality I found especially refreshing is how the story is presented from the woman character's perspective:  she is the audience's `point of access' to what is, essentially, an alien world.  The music (by Vishal Shekhar) backs this up - and is perfectly delightful in its own right.  I love this music!  Whether it's the charming goofiness of `Tu Meri', or the romantic idyll of `Meherbaan' that simply could define ""mellow"".  A personal favourite is the playful `Uff'.  [Both tall and leggy, AND great dancers, Hrithik & Katrina could have been born to dance together.]  But the ever-talented Hrithik's homage dance tribute to the late great Michael Jackson in the title track, `Bang Bang', over the end credits is an absolute Must See.

""Bang Bang!"" is one of India's biggest ever global blockbusters, theatrically released in more than 50 countries worldwide with (deservedly) phenomenal success.

Dialogue is Hindi and English, with English subtitles.

NOTE ON BLU-RAY EDITION:  For its standard DVD release, manufacturer (T-Series) packaged ""Bang Bang!"" in a lovely slipcased 2-disc box, but nonetheless crammed both the movie and its special features onto a single DVD.  Neither the sound nor picture quality of the resultant DVD matched up to the standard of the original film.

If one has Blu-Ray playback capability, I recommend the buyer to hold out for this high definition Blu-Ray edition.  Because ""Bang Bang!"" is one movie you'll want to enjoy again and again!",1418428800,3,3743,5.200333889816361

Nothing will disappoint you.

6853293,3,B00Q2OKOLI,"In Bang Bang two of the best looking people alive travel the world fighting a crime syndicate and fall in love.  Hrithik Roshan is an international jewel thief with skills that both James Bond and Rambo would envy.  Katrina Kaif plays the modest bank clerk who becomes his sidekick.  Together they evade police and crooks across India, England, the Czech Republic and Abu Dhabi.  There's elaborate stunt sequences and chases, musical numbers and bad guys die by the bucket load.

The action sequences are impressive, one chase involving a speed boats, jet skis and a flying jet board is unlike anything I have seen before.  But they are so over the top, it's hard to take them seriously.  All of them are the sort of gun fight where a dozen thugs with machine guns can't hit the hero but he can kill them with his flawless marksmanship every time.

Which creates a bit of a problem.  Sometimes this is a cute romantic comedy and heist film.  And then someone is set on fire and hacked with an ax.  For most of the film Kaif is a frightened everygirl dragged into a world of intrigue, then she's machine gunning guys at point blank range.  Like many Indian masala films the tone shifts are jarring and make this hard to watch.

So the action is impressive and the stars are gorgeous.  But really if you're looking for something like this I would go with Dhoom 2 (also staring Hrithik Roshan) and Dhoom 3 (also starring Katrina Kaif).  Both are the same sort of action/romance/heist but don't have the excessive killing this one did.",1481587200,,1531,4.597785977859779
6853294,5,B00Q2OKOLI,"I absolutely love love love this movie!  It was entertaining throughout with beautiful scenery, excellent action scenes, great songs and Hrithik Roshan was worth it all!  Man, what can't he do??!!  I could watch this movie over and over especially the dance scenes with Hrithik in it!  Omg!  He is so hot!  If you like Knight and Day with Tom Cruise, you are in for a delicious treat with Bang Bang!  I think even better!  Now, they do speak mostly Hindu but they mix English in there as well but English subtitles all the way through it for us who aren't bilingual.  He (Hrithik) needs to bring his acting talents to Hollywood for sure!!!  Overall??  Excellent movie!",1479427200,,668,4.6239316239316235
6853295,5,B00Q2OKOLI,"I enjoyed this film more than Knight and Day, though Bang Bang only borrows from the basic premise of the original.  Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif have great onscreen chemistry.  In fact, this is the first onscreen pairing, that I have enjoyed as much as the iconic Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol.  The action sequences are riveting and the songs and dance sequences are inspiring.  These 2 actors are amazing dancers, probably the best in Hindi cinema right now.

Katrina very believable in this and perfect for the role. Overall really loved it. Will watch it again one day. Beautiful North Indian scenery and good dance scenes placed well so as not to give it a cheesy feeling. This movie MOVES and is very alive, yet with tender and slow moments as well.

But knowing the English is not necessary cause the movie is that awesome. Unfortunately I purchased a Bad DVD from Planet Bollywood and was extremely disappointed. The plastic looked as if it were sealed by a heated knife. The box had a slight squash. The photo that goes with the Normal Dvd English Subtitled Version was not the one on my copy. My copy was the ordinary dvd but had the Blu Ray Version Photo. The plastic part inside holding the dvd had a big triangular crack. The dvd itself had a few long surface scratches. However, on one part of the dvd  were one inch length deeply dug in scratches at the beginning of the dvd to its middle....thus making it unplayable. Extremely Disappointed. I could have bought it pirated in my country of Trinidad West Indies. But I never buy pirated and it's Way Too Special a Movie not to have the original copy. Will Not be purchasing from Planet Bollywood or any other buyer least I waste more money. I paid for it to be sent to my Miami Skybox Address and then sent to Trinidad West Indies where I had to pay an additional 6 charges. Will always love the movie...but I don't wish my hopes being squashed again. If you get a good copy...Thank GOD many times over that you were so fortunate.",1455408000,,1382,4.462450592885376

Personally I love these films for their singing and dancing, as well. I have seen Hrithik Roshan several times before, and not only does he do most of his own stunts, but that is really his totally ripped body and off the charts dance steps. Katrina Kaif is a little chubby in this film but that is part cultural. She is not as good a dancer as some female leads I have seen, but she has a natural air about her that I liked.

6853326,3,B00Q2OKOLI,"First of all, I loved the music in this movie. Modern sounding without the club sound, but catchy and very romantic. A few funny parts, but overall an action movie, with Hrithik, of course, being the perfect tough guy. My only thing against it is, I didn't care for all the violence. From the very beginning it starts off violent, and is almost continual through the rest of the movie. There's no blood shown, but a lot of shooting and hand-to-hand combat, with even neck-snapping. Katrina Kaif seems the same as she usually is in her roles. Three stars for the storyline, music, and chemistry between Hrithik and Katrina.",1442275200,,622,4.715596330275229

6853330,4,B00Q2OKOLI,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie 'Bang! Bang!'  It was exciting, suspenseful, very funny in parts, good music, gorgeous lead actors, great acting and amazing stunts.  Hrithik Roshan was telling the truth when he said this movie is different from the Tom Cruise movie ""Knight and Day and that it is better"". Of course, it may seem better because of the fact that it is different in a lot of ways. 'Forthcoming Bollywood action entertainer Bang Bang has been called the official remake of Tom Cruise-starrer Knight and Day, but its lead actor Hrithik Roshan says its different and better. That's not saying that Knight and Day was not a good movie. It's just different in a lot of ways from Bang! Bang!. If you have not seen ""Knight and Day"" then, don't watch it until after you see ""Bang! Bang!""

Something where you can just relaxed and enjoy the movie without thinking too much! It served it purposes for what it was intended to accomplish! I love happy endings!

6853343,4,B00Q2OKOLI,"As someone who boasts two/sixths of Hrithik Roshan's six pack, I should really resent the guy, should seek to tear him down. But he's so damn likeable that all I do is cheer him on. That Bang Bang was a 2014 Bollywood blockbuster is attributed primarily to Hrithik's charisma and those redonkulous abs and the silkiness of his dance moves. If you'd seen Knight & Day, the 2010 Hollywood picture Bang Bang is based on, then you know that, plotwise, both films lurk in the shallow end of the pool. Bang Bang is mindless escapist cinema. Ain't much in the way of novelty. But there is loud commotion. And absurd car chases and 'splosions and stunts lifted from Jackie Chan and John Woo and possibly the lads from District B13. And an endless parade of product placement. And a sense of bloatedness. And yet I liked the movie.

The plot: When the celebrated Kohinoor diamond is filched from the Tower of London - a daring heist that reinvigorates old grudges between India and the UK - who would've thunk it that demure bank receptionist Harleen Sahani (Katrina Kaif), of the Bank of Shimla, would end up on a blind date with the jewel's new proprietor? That's right! This is what the online dating service, Trueluvv.com, can do for you. Yearning for adventure and romance? Register with Trueluvv.com and make a connection with a fascinating stranger. Tired of her staid existence, Harleen impulsively signs on.

But come many moments when Harleen regrets her impromptu decision. She doesn't normally go out on dates. And her blind date, this guy (Hrithik Roshan) named Vicki who later on says his name is Rajveer, comes off as an insane person. He keeps shooting at people. On the plus side, he's got wicked abs and killer dance moves. Could Rajveer's madcap behavior have something to do with a notorious master criminal at large (Danny Denzongpa), him what's #1 on Interpol's Most Wanted list? Did the theft of the Kohinoor diamond jeopardize a proposed extradition treaty between India and the UK? And is there a daft plan in place? Some clarity behind Rajveer's irrationality? Well, yes, to everything. It's not like the movie is trying to pull a fast one. It lays out the trajectory of its story arc from jump. There are no surprises.

Once you've done ogling the two heavenly leads, what then? If the daredevil stunts don't sustain you thru the film, what exactly is it that you take away from the movie experience? Not much. But, eh, so what? So what if the film is absent of real dramatic content and genuine emotion? And that everything is played so over-the-top that the story soon forfeits its sense of grounding? This is when you find out whether the lead is a true star, if they could still draw in the masses despite his vehicle's onerous level of suck. In Bollywood, Hrithik Roshan is THE man, nowadays maybe more so than even the Khans. Hrithik generates unbelievable charm, and he works hard at his craft (he's actually an accomplished actor), and you know he racks up the gym hours. He elevates this movie. Katrina Kaif is sultry as the inhibited eye candy. We won't talk about her acting. It's amusing, though, that after 25 or so films under her belt, they're still coming up with excuses for her accented Hindi (she was born outside of India). Anyway, with an offhanded remark, we're made aware that Harleen is Canadian-born.

So Bang Bang is just like its Hollywood predecessor. Crazy ass stunts, location shoots at sun-drenched paradise locales, and a paper-thin script. There are lapses in logic. There is flair but not much substance. There may be sensory overload because it's such a loud movie and we're always mere moments away from the next gaudy action set. The action hero comes across as unhinged and is so outlandish that he seems like a cartoon or video game figure. It's hard to take the two leads seriously. In Bang Bang, the songs are mostly forgettable except they're then made memorable by Hrithik's busting ill moves to them. The one track that I did groove to a bunch is the title song that plays during the closing credits. I certify that as a club banger.

Why am I giving Bang Bang 3.5 out of 5 stars? One word: Hrithik. He's the end-all and be-all of the movie. He somehow parlays the film's numbing excesses into a fun time for the viewing audience. And, sometimes, it's the little things, too. Like the one scene that signs off with a throwaway retort that really cracked me up.

- Karan Saxena, full-of-himself scion of the Shimla banking firm, stupidly standing in Rajveer's way: ""I am a green belt in kung fu karate. My flying kick is so fast that I can knock a flying bird out of the air.""
- Karan Saxena, whimpering after Rajveer shoots him: ""But... why?""
- Rajveer: ""You were about to use your flying kick on me. I couldn't take a chance.""

Okay, it's funnier when you watch it onscreen.

6853344,4,B00Q2OKOLI,"I warn you that if you are looking for an original film be prepared for a rude shock, Bang Bang is a remake of the Tom Cruise movie Knight and Day. So almost everything is the same- just a few tweaks here and there to adapt it to the Indian milieu.  It is a mish mash of so many different films and settings we have seen in the past that you might often thin that you have seen this before.
Harleeen ( Katrina Kaif) has a boring life as a receptionist at a bank in Shimla. She reluctantly signs up for a date at a match making site and happens to meet Rajveer ( Hrithik) because of a misunderstanding . She falls in love with him but she realizes that he is an international crook, but cannot get rid of him because all the spy agencies think that she is an alias/accomplice. It happens to be that Rajveer has stolen the Kohinoor diamond and has everyone from cops to villains ( Danny Denzongpa) looking for them
Hrithik Roshan is watchable and does a good job as an thief who has stolen the Kohinoor diamond from the British. Roshan not only looks great but fights and dances well. I could not say who was the better knight  was it Cruise in the original or Hrithik in this version.
Katrina looks good but sadly Hrithik and her don't have the chemistry at all.
Music for me was a big, big letdown- Vishal-Shekhar are simply not that good anymore- however they remain the choice of big films and seriously they need to be replaced. I can't remember a single song that could be remembered except maybe Meherbaan, and that was only because of the choreography. The only reasons that the songs were watchable was because of the locations and Hrithik's dancing (seriously, this man can dance)
This is not a classic but a movie that will entertain you for the length of its duration.  Just leave your  brain at home.",1423526400,,1811,4.364985163204747

Better than Tom  Cruise's Knight and Day - better premise. And the dancing was over the top.  I love to dance too!  Make more of these movies.  You're  a real star.  Your co-star was good as well.  Hrithik, II see good things ahead for you - your  humility will carry you far.  Your movies have a redemptive quality about them - you take care of those you care about.  Would like to meet you some day.

Thanks for the quality entertainment.  It's as good as what we put out in the states - even better.

8690101,5,B00Q2OKOLI,"Okay have to say that Im a white girl and I love Bollywood. I also love musicals, rom coms, theater, and anything thats entertaining and funny and takes you out of your everyday dull life to a world of fantasy and adventure. Star Trek? Yes.  lord of the rings? Yes. princess bride? Yes. 007? Yes. Rogers and Hammerstein? Yes. (You get the picture) Any how this movie for sure takes you to another place. A place full of life and adventure. And maybe a bit of danger too. The way I see it, its almost a spoof on 007. The action sequences are totally unbelievable (but so is James Bond for that matter). This adventure hits on pretty much all the action you could want; car chases, explosions, double agents, leaps off buildings, ocean speedboat chases, scaling walls, romance, etc. the list goes on. Both performances are excellent all the way through and highly entertaining. The villain is also awesome. You love to hate him.
This is action action action. And if you miss any of it, to go to the bathroom or get a snack you won't have any idea whats going on next. Make sure to pause if youve got to get up. I also love Bollywood as mostly is clean entertainment. No sex scenes and swearing is usually minimal (if any). I love how they can have a romance without falling into bed together after knowing each other one day. There are a lot of little hidden jokes and cute comments in this movie. Every time I watch it I see something new and Ive seen it about five times now. Netflix had it for a while but took it down, so I bought it. The song sequences also serve to move the story along. So they are integrated and feel like part of the storyline rather than a random song tucked into the story which makes no sense and you feel that you have to fast forward to get back to the story. (Dont fast forward on the songs with this- you will end up missing story line if you do. )
Trust me. Just watch it. Yes it hokey and cheesy, but its entertainment and lots of it. Great stuff.",1505952000,2,1980,4.28
