6199453,5,B00HR736AA,This is one of best animes ever for sure. The battle scenes are worth every penny. This is a must own.,1402790400,5,102,3.9047619047619047
6199454,5,B00HR736AA,"I bought this box set because I have all of the previous box sets of Bleach. This box set was truly awesome, the battle with Aizen got very intense, that was most of the story in this box set. There is at least one weird episode, so be on the lookout. I definitely recommend this box set as long as you have the 20 box sets that came before this one.",1402531200,3,350,3.943661971830986
6199455,5,B00HR736AA,"I love Bleach.  These box sets are incredible....  BUT....The complete Bleach series is available on Hulu.  They are sub-titled but I was surprised how naturally they flowed, coming from someone who had only watched the dubbed version.  I wish I had known before spending over $500 on box sets.

Sign up for 1 free month and watch them all.  And guess what: it's not just what's been released in the US... it's all 360+ episodes.

5 stars for Bleach and these sets - and I hope this advice helps some of you out there.",1399593600,15,518,4.446808510638298

6199477,4,B00HR736AA,This is a little odd it continues the main story but there is a back and forth from the story.  first main story for a bit then a short story then back to main story then another story that gets started then back to main story.  Uhmmm ok. its why it has 4 stars.  Definitely quite annoying.,1434585600,,290,4.052631578947368

The only thing that bothers me is the repetition at the start of some of the disks because it takes from the time in the series but I realize it was made for TV so it will need to recap.,1407628800,3,268,3.8727272727272726

8634677,4,B00HR736AA,"More great Bleach to buy if you love the series. More filler episodes here than I'd like, but still worth purchasing.

Aizen finally gets in on the action.

This is an example of how I wish the animators and writers for the Bleach filler episodes had done a better job. As much as people hated the Bount Arc way back in the beginning, those filler episodes were written and handled much better than the ones that came after trying to draw out the anime as it caught up with the manga.

Still worth the purchase for Bleach lovers",1523145600,,528,4.36734693877551
