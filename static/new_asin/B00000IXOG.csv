1230708,3,B00000IXOG,"This video has a great 15 minute workout for arms...I've been using it for about three weeks and have definitely noticed a great difference. As for the rest of the three workouts..They are very advanced, and confusing.  The  instructor knows what she is doing, but doesn't take the time to explain  the moves to the viewer.",952992000,6,323,4.732142857142857
1230709,3,B00000IXOG,"I loved the concept and I bought the tape. Anything that encourages organic movement is worth a shot. The abs section was wonderful. It was a good strength workout, but also encouraged form, grace and flexibility.  Upper arms were also interesting. I had a very hard time following the more  ballet-like moves, based on balance and coordination (which I lack). I  don't recommend this tape for beginners, but everyone else will enjoy a  healthy, safe workout.",950572800,4,459,5.0
1230740,4,B00000IXOG,This video is awesome!  Very effective.  I would've given 5 stars but the disc skips.  I wanted to replace the disc but the only option with Amazon was to return it.  It works well enough so I kept it but it skips in the same part every time.,1461801600,,242,3.9791666666666665

1230744,5,B00000IXOG,It is the best exercise routine I had in years. Easy to follow and helps a lot to keep in shape. I had found it when I hit 50 and was following it on and off for the last 15 years. Definitely will recommend it for this age group.,1443830400,,229,3.693877551020408

The segments are only 15 minutes long so you can do as many or as little as you like. My favorite workout DVD of all time. Highly recommend - you will have amazing results!",1440288000,,319,4.245901639344262

1230783,5,B00000IXOG,"This DVD is worth it's weight in gold just for the ""Arms"" section alone.  It somehow manages to hit every single muscle in your upper body (and even a few in your legs & seat) in just under 15 minutes.  I've used it off and on for years using 2-3 lb weights and I'm always astounded at the results.  Perfect for rounding out an old fashioned Callanetics or Lotte Berk routine where the upper body work can be lacking.",1406073600,2,417,4.253164556962025
1230784,1,B00000IXOG,"I had the original edition of this - back when it was just Jennifer Kreiss and there was no annoying drum soundtrack. THAT I liked. This is a different version, with a bunch of other exercisers - not in itself a bad thing - but the relentless soundtrack and the quasi-mystical narration is annoying. The straightforward - and very effective - Method is buried in hooey.",1390089600,2,369,4.606060606060606
1230785,5,B00000IXOG,"I purchased this on VHS years ago and like it so much that I finally decided to buy it on DVD.  I really enjoy Jennifer's instruction and how the workout is divided in to four 15-minute segments covering different areas of the body (abs, arms, hips, thighs).  I also love that she uses only drums (no annoying pop music, which for me grows tiresome after multiple plays).

Target specifics is a good intro to ballet and yoga movements and is great for improving flexibility.

(Low/no impact, great for beginners or women looking to maintain flexibility.)",1386547200,,554,4.8

1230810,5,B00000IXOG,I love this dvd. I recive this as a gift from my doctor when I first started to lose weight. So I pop in the dvd and never looked back. I belive the best part of the dvd you can chose witch  work out you want to do. So if you are looking for great pilates work out  make sure to buy this dvd.,1372032000,,292,3.546875

1230814,5,B00000IXOG,I had The Method Pilates VHS for a number of years.  Then my VHS player stopped working and I bought the DVD.  The Method Pilates is an excellent tool for in-home exercising.,1364774400,,174,4.40625
1230815,5,B00000IXOG,"I love this DVD. I actually did this workout in college on the VHS version to help work off the college weight gain. It worked great, and I felt fantastic. I'm a decade older now and really was noticing that my flexibility and core strength was diminishing, so I ordered the DVD off Amazon. I am so glad I did! Two weeks into it, I have more fliexibility, I feel stronger, and my back pain is diminishing. Also, I am excited to see the toning, particularly in my abs and arms, as those are trouble spots for me. This is split up into four segments: Abs, Arms, Hips, and Thighs. They are great on their own or if you want to do the entire DVD. I also love the rhythmic drumming for the music. It is great, and never gets annoying. In short, I highly recommend this and can not wait to see the results as I contine to progress.",1361923200,,825,4.1625

1230817,5,B00000IXOG,"Of all the workout DVD's I've ever done (and I've done quite a few) this one is by far my favorite. It is split into four, fifteen minute segments. The first one is for abs and is mostly done on the floor, but is a hard workout for your stomach. You have to work up to being able to do all the exercises, it took me about three weeks of doing the workout before I could do all the ab exercises. The second workout is for arms, and uses a pair of light weights. It works ALL the parts of your arm, including your shoulders and upper back and is fantastic. The third segment is for hips, and has a emphasis on ballet moves, which are AMAZING for toning your inner and outer thighs. It is challenging at first, but it pays off quickly. The fourth and final segment is for thighs and is a synthesis of pilates, yoga, and ballet movements.

Overall, I recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to get into good shape and wants to strengthen and  tone their muscles. Additionally, there is live music playing behind the workout instructors, which is a pleasant relief from the garbage elevator music you often are subjected to in workout videos.",1358553600,3,1136,4.35377358490566
1230818,5,B00000IXOG,I love this DVD the exercise segments are short but effective I do one segment in the morning and two at night. Its very easy to follow along I start using it about a month ago and I lost about 9lbs and I feel so long and lean.,1341792000,,227,3.75
1230819,5,B00000IXOG,"I am 64 years young woman and I have been doing Pilates/target Specifics with Jennifer Kries ever since my daughter-in-Law game me the tape version eight/nine years ago, and I have been working-out non-stop three days a week.  I love it!!!!.  It really keeps my body tone and flexible.  Each work-out helps me with every part of my body.  It really is a ""complete"" work-out. My tape version was damaged and I was frustrated because I could not workout even though after so many years I already knew all the exercises but it is not the same.  I do like to hear Jennifer instructing and I do like the music too.  I almost gave it up; then I decided to search it online and I was so excited when I saw it for sale at Amazon.  It is a very intense work out but I absolutely recommend it!!!",1339459200,,785,4.263513513513513
1230840,5,B00000IXOG,"I have been using this DVD for about 5 years now and absolutely love it. I have numerous other Pilates DVDs that seem to focus solely on the core (which they should) but this also incorporates arms and legs for a true full body workout. As a former Division 1 athlete, I have a tough time finding workouts that are challenging, but I keep this one in my rotation at all times. It has also done so much to help my back and my body feels almost clean when I am done, even though it's tired. LOVE IT!",1326326400,,497,4.081632653061225
1230841,5,B00000IXOG,"I love this DVD, it gives you an option in what you want to work on. If I want to start with arms, thighs, abs or hip you can choice it. I've had this for more then 5yrs and I still get a work out. I prefer using in the moring where I get a good workout and the engery to start my day.",1315094400,,285,3.46875
1230842,4,B00000IXOG,"Keep in mind that this review is coming from an overweight 40-something woman.

I love using these videos! Jennifer never loses count, even when she explains things, which is important to me. I have fibromyalgia so I need a workout that is loving toward my body and not a lot of jarring and ""punishing."" These moves are challenging for me, who is overweight but flexible, and I come out of the workouts feeling amazing.

Abs and arms sections are quite nice and I adore them!!

Hips section - there are a lot of balancing ballet moves that at first threw me off completely. However, as I used the video and kept reminding myself ""just do what you can, don't worry about being perfect"" I started to achieve greater balance and a better workout each time. I simply adore this section now. It makes me feel like a long lean ballerina although I'm anything but.

The legs section is one that I don't particularly like. I'm not a fan of yoga that gets you standing, lunging, planking, standing, look up and breathe, then lunge again, plank again, look up... blah blah blah. It's just not for me, so I skip this section. I find that I get a very challenging workout for my legs in the other sections.

All sections incorporate ALL areas of the body, even if the focus is on abs, or arms, or whatever. My legs still get sore and feel strong afterwards. I'm seeing new muscles when I shave my legs.",1311984000,,1390,4.456692913385827
1230843,5,B00000IXOG,"I purchased this DVD back in 2004. I will never forget that summer.....I got grounded the whole summer :( lol.....so everyday since I had no car at the time I would wake up and do the 1 hour workout in the basement. Sometimes when I really had nothing to do, I would end up doing the DVD twice a day.....but I mainly did it once a day for 6 days.....now since my school started back up in the fall, I only had 2 months of summer to get over/work out...Jennifer is amazing.....I was a size 16 when I started beginning of the summer, when I got back to school I was a comfortable size 10......a freaking 10!!!!! Everyone's mouths dropped when they seen me, i didn't even weigh myself just went by my clothes size....it gave me great shape and everything! I lie to you not, this is absolutely great! and I ate what I wanted, just did portion control...I was an Atkins freak a while back also which made me lose alot of weight but the Target Specifics is a great workout dvd....I was a beginner in pilates while doing this tape, she does pick up the beat as you go, but its nothing wrong just watching and doing the novice......but im now 26 and i was 20 at the time and I found the dvd...... :)",1306108800,4,1191,4.228070175438597
1230844,5,B00000IXOG,I became familiar with this Pilates workout on VHS when it first was released.  I recently purchased it on DVD and still find it to be a well rounded challenging workout.  It is broken down into four 15min target sections.  Each section is a great workout for the areas of the body it addresses and in my opinion is best suited for intermediate to advanced Pilates students.,1304899200,,374,4.552238805970149

1230846,2,B00000IXOG,"The instructor does a good job of showing how the moves are done, but as far as a true work out is concerned, it doesn't do the the job.  This is great for BEGINNERS but after 2 weeks you will need something else.",1288656000,2,213,3.953488372093023
1230847,5,B00000IXOG,"I bought this a few years ago and had misplaced it and had to get another copy. I love the balanced approach that pulls from ballet, yoga and pilates to give you a good workout. I like her attention to form in each of the exercises and I personally have not found a better workout for my arms. I find that this goes quickly and I also like that she does stretching at the end of each section before moving on. The four sections make it easy to pick and choose your workout, and I usually find myself doing two one day and two the next. It is a very challenging workout, especially the ab section, but you can go your own pace and just do what you can. When I did this before, I really found results after doing this for a few weeks.",1285718400,,732,4.055172413793104

With only a few classes of this and that since and the last few years spent raising my little one. This dvd was just right for me. The 15 min sections are easy to fit into my tight schedule and are as hard or as easy as I make them. I am looking forward to the beach this year knowing Jennifer has helped me shape up, and maybe I'll have the confidence to join a class.",1271980800,,449,3.7872340425531914
1230849,2,B00000IXOG,"I work out a lot, and have a lot of at home DVD's, and I don't think this one is as good of a work out. It's also not a full 60 minutes as it claims - they spend a few minutes for each 15 minute segment doing breathing or stretches, and even with that it's only 55 minutes.",1258502400,,273,3.6440677966101696

1230861,4,B00000IXOG,"Overview
15 minutes of Abs
15 minutes of arms
15 minutes of hips
15 minutes of thighs

Ab: great, lots of different moves, totally do-able  but hard enough that at the same time will help those who are already in super duper shape along with the flabby belly ones.

Arms: you need to get weights (2-3lbs) which I don't normally like to do. I like exercises that use just the natural body weight, resistance, etc but the exercises are good and you don't have to use the weights the entire time. She does this thing called yoga presses... killer.

hips: a lot of ballet moves. I had more trouble keeping my arms up. You have to get used to the motions in order to get the most results from them. In the beginning I was just trying to hold balance most of the time. But over time as the balance got better, the moves actually started to do something.

thighs: very similar to the hip section. You do a few new moves but basically very similar. There are a few yoga moves in this section that I like like Sun salutations and a few others... but that's normal in pilates to have a lot of yoga stuff

I like Jennifer's style. It is not so ""in your face"" and she is mild in her manners and voice. overall I would recommend to those who want a pilates video that targets specific areas of the body... I always do the entire video at one time (1 hour) so I get the total body thing but you can break the sections up for shorter exercises",1235606400,,1428,4.212454212454213
1230862,5,B00000IXOG,"I have been using Pilates ""The Method"" for years.  It is somewhat dated, done in 90's... but look past that!  It has the best basic pilate and ballet toning I have ever found.  Takes alittle time getting the moves down... if you have never done basic pilates or ballet toning.  Give yourself afew weeks to get it down and work thru the sore muscle days.  I am never in such toned shape and if I slide back, tone back in no time.  When I started out, did it 4-6 days aweek with walking in between.  Within 6 weeks, down to 1-4 times a week and walking still.  Try to take 1-2 days off in the week.",1228608000,,596,4.077586206896552
1230863,4,B00000IXOG,"I've tried many different workouts for years, but none of them have had such rapid results like pilates! I have even tried Callanetics, (which has many moves from pilates) that was supposed to have fast results, but between that & Pilates, there is no comparison (unless I was doing the poses wrong..).

I used the Pilates Method, Precision Pilates dvd before this one, & I love them both! It's a faster pace & I believe a little less reps than Precision Pilates, but still effective. I only dock this one star, bc I wish there were a few more workouts for the abs section.

I enjoy working out with Jennifer Kries in her dvds. She shows her personality, but is calm & relaxing in the workouts (Unlike some videos, where the instructor is bouncing off the walls with a high screechy voice..). She takes the time to explain the poses & you can hear her breathing, which helps you learn how to breath properly for each workout.

All-in-all, great dvd!",1224028800,,949,4.570588235294117
1230864,5,B00000IXOG,"I had this workout on VHS maybe 5 or 6 years ago.  I recently wanted to get back into Pilates, etc and went through 2 others before I realized I needed to find this one on DVD.

Jennifer does a great job leading the workout.  She encourages beginners to continue with the excercises to work up to their abilities.  And for the more experienced, the workout contains challenging pieces.  It is a fun workout to do and I feel great afterwards.

Another bonus to this workout is that it is divided into 4 parts focusing on different areas.  You can do the full 1 hour workout or break it into 2 30 minute workouts.",1219968000,,611,4.307017543859649
1230865,2,B00000IXOG,"A lot of her stuff is repetative. 2nd, She takes at least 2 -3 minutes of the beginning of all 15 min with breathing and explanation. 3rd, the HIPS and THIGHS works outs are almost exaclty the same. And also the excercises in these 2 are almost ALL Ballet. A lot of  ballet.
This video is from 2001 too. I'd try something more up to date.
I didn't feel the abs work out did much, i felt like i was doing an 80's jazzercise class. The only good thing is the ARMS routine.",1219190400,,470,4.053763440860215
1230866,5,B00000IXOG,"I bought this DVD after my VHS wore out. It is a mixture of pilates, yoga and ballet. 15 minute sections that target different areas. Perfect. She is an amazing instructor! Going at just the right pace, she uses techniques that are challenging enough to actually do something for you and easy enough that everyone can participate. I have hip and back problems, and my mother has had multiple back surgeries and these excersizes are gentle enough for us both yet effective enough that after three weeks I had compliments from coworkers who inquired if I had been working out! I have never had a excersize program (or even gym memberships!) that did that. This has an EXCELLENT program for slimming hips and thighs that WORKS!! The ONLY excersizes I have ever done that has actually slimmed my hips, and I am a fairly athletic person (swimming, softball, volleyball, basketball, etc). I highly recommend this to everyone! The music is actually kinda nice too, not annoying at all- a plus for a excersize video anyway!",1217289600,2,1015,4.805714285714286
1230867,5,B00000IXOG,I AM A BEGINNER.  I started this workout 4 years ago and stopped for a long time and have started it up again.  I love it.  I don't feel tired after or even the next day like I would when I lift weights.  I feel relaxed and refreshed.  I also feel stronger.  I plan on getting more workouts of Jennifer Kries.  She is the best instructor.,1213747200,,338,4.03030303030303
1230868,5,B00000IXOG,I had this on VHS years ago and when I moved lost it. I was dying to get it back but it is almost impossible to find. This is the best thing for anyone who cannot do high impact for any reason. The DVD is broken up into 4 15 minute sections one each day will do the trick. The movement is gentle but effective and you will see the trimming and toning all women look for.,1207440000,2,370,3.8181818181818183
1230869,4,B00000IXOG,"I'm a gym fanatic, but when it comes to home workouts, this is my favorite. I have an entire library of home workouts, but this is the one that's stood by me through many years. I do the abs and yoga (thighs) sections at least twice a week. The arm section is nice when I don't feel like dealing with heavy bulky weights. The only part I don't like is the ballet sections on both hips and thighs. I wish she had done something a little bit different, but I just skip over these parts. The ending segment in hips is really good though, so I usually do it when I'm going into the thigh/yoga section. I love this tape, and even think the drums playing in the background is cool. Sometimes if I don't feel like hearing the drums, I put the volume on low just to hear instructions and play my own music through my stereo system- I have the routine pretty much memorized anyway. All in all- my favorite workout tape, EVER.",1199750400,2,916,4.24
1230890,5,B00000IXOG,"Jennifer Kries combines ballet, pilates, and yoga into a flowing, well-instructed set of exercises.  She empathizes control, balance, and focus to get the most out of each movement, and her instruction is motivating without being annoying.  The choice of exercises is balanced and the pace is challenging but achievable.  I initially feared that the live drumming of the soundtrack would be too repetitive, but I actually find it enjoyable and well-suited to the workout.  The workout is divided into four 15-minute chapters (Abs, Arms, Hips, Thighs), which makes each segment long enough for results but manageable when time is limited.

There are some advanced Pilates movements (particularly in the Abs section) as well as several ballet movements - and no instructor showing modifications - so this DVD might frustrate someone who is brand new to Pilates.  It is probably best suited to those who have at least some Pilates experience and are looking for a strong ""fusion"" workout to balance out their repertoire.

Most of the content has been covered in other reviews, so I'll just add a few thoughts that might be useful.  First, the Abs section starts with a somewhat long segment about posture and breathing.  Those concepts are crucial to the practice of Pilates, but it might have been nice if they were covered separately to save the time.  However, the Abs section makes up for the lost minutes - in fact, there are days I'm GLAD it's shortened a few minutes :-) Second, the ""Hips"" and ""Thighs"" sections use several of the same exercises, with the exception of the yoga poses (Sun Salutations, Warrior, Awkward Chair, Lunges) that dominate the Thighs section.

Overall, a fantastic workout!",1198972800,,1702,5.042857142857143
1230891,4,B00000IXOG,I usually just do the arm section on this DVD because it is unique from my other Pilates/yoga DVDs. For this section you'll need light hand weihts (I use three lbs) and I've noticed more tone and definition in my arms since I began doing this workout regularly.

I am happy to say that one year and two months after my baby was born - I have a pretty flat belly!! woo-hoo.  The ab section on this video is the best ab workout I have ever done.  I did this daily for about 6 months after my baby was born and then I switched it up and did other videos - worked out at the gym and so forth - well I lost all the baby weight and some more!

J.K. does a great job as usually making an interesting workout, but I just can't get over the drum beat thing. The ""live"" music could have been fun if they would have toned it down.

1230895,5,B00000IXOG,"I've been studying pilates and gyrotonics for six years with some of the top instructors in NYC but with the increasing popularity of pilates, the sessions have gotten absurdly expensive, which is why I wanted to try a DVD. I have never been one to work out in my home, but ths is truly an amazing workout and not only have I saved so much money by doing this DVD instead of my beloved studio sessions, but I'm able to incorporate it into my busy schedule and do it much more often than I ever could with the sessions.

As the reviews before me have indicated, the DVD is broken up into four segments that each target a specific area, but I think that's slightly misleading. While about sixty or seventy percent of the exercises in each section do target the area they are labeled under, each section also contains a variety of stretches and counter-workouts as well, which make for a more overall workout, whether you're doing one section or four at a time. For instance, in the section entitled ""abs"" you'll also find exercises that strengthen the back muscles and legs. Therefore, you're able to get a lot of variety and a great overall workout!

******NOTE:  I recommend this highly for intermediates and advanced students of pilates, but NOT for beginners!!!  In order to do these exercises correctly, you must know the basic pilates foundation such as pelvic placement, breathing techniques, and proper alignment. If you are attempting these exercises as a beginner, they may seem straightforward, but without the proper foundation and knowledge (which is NOT explained), you may not be doing the exercises properly and worse, could get hurt.*******

For those who are newer to pilates, I would recommend perhaps watching the video first, as it moves at what I would consider a fast intermediate pace.",1157500800,28,1807,4.816129032258065

I lost all 60 pounds of baby weight. I absolutly love this DVD and have noticed  changes in my body since I started using it for workouts. That was 3 years ago. Now I teach pilates and often refer back to this DVD for moves to introduce to my class. I have also lent out this DVD for a number of friends to try before they purchase their own. My friends alway rave about it.",1156204800,3,545,3.90990990990991
1230897,5,B00000IXOG,"I just did Jennifer Krie's Target Specifics and I really enjoyed it, I got a great workout and was dripping with sweat by the time I was done with it.

 While this is a program that is designed so that it can be done in 15 minute self contained increments, I was curious to see how it would be to do it as one long session with very short breaks between sections.

 The individual sections were certainly excellent in and of  themselves and can easily benefit someone who is pressed for time but wants to get some Pilates/Yoga and some Ballet type exercises in.

 The format of the program is so well explained by other reviewers I won't rehash all that they have laid out so well.

 You don't need much to do this program, just a Yoga or Pilates type mat and a set of very light hand weights. I must admit that at first I thought that using those light weights wouldn't do much, but now I can see that the point is about having fluidity of motion with control, as well as awareness of the core. The weights just create a gentle resistance to the movement. I had to get past the mindset of my old weight training days in order to appreciate the value of using light weights through these various ranges of motion.

 As a relatively uncoordinated (in terms of dance movements) 46 year old male, I found the ballet type moves that are incorporated in the third section to be something that will really help me with my balance. The movements weren't that hard to grasp and were an interesting challenge.

 If someone has never done Pilates or Yoga before they should probably start with something that explains the basics of those disciplines. Stott Pilates Basics is a great program for Pilates and Yoga Zone Basics is a great place to start with Yoga.

 Once you have an idea of the fundamentals of those approaches then you will at least have some background in which to try this program. It moves fast and fluidly without much explanation so you will want to have some experience before trying this.

I do really like the ""Abs"" workout, especially if you are short on time but want a really effective workout.

I appreciated the use of non-traditional exercises to tone (I WON'T do crunches), but I was disappointed that it wasn't Pilates.  Sure, there was some Pilates involved, but it's more ballet than anything, and the ""Thighs"" section is mostly yoga.  I'm OK with that, because I like yoga, but the DVD shouldn't be called Pilates.

My favorite thing about this workout is the abs session, which is a killer.. I really notice my abs for a day or two afterward.  The abs part is more Pilates than the rest, so I guess Pilates really work!

I disagree with some people's assessment that Jennifer Kries doesn't cue well and it's hard to follow.  There are multiple camera angles of Jennifer and the other women, and I found it very easy to follow.  Without any ballet or dance background, I was with them throughout, on the second time I did the workout.  Also, she explains about proper posture and breathing; and she reminds you from time to time.

1230915,1,B00000IXOG,"I found the drums to be most annoying.  I just purchased it and wished there was a way of muting the drums.  Impossible to mute though as you really need to pay close attention to her quick instruction of moves and her transition from one move to another was too fast and left me with little time to do all the reps or doing them the wrong way.

I was disappointed as I thought the whole workout would have been solely pilates but she incorporates ballet, aerobics, etc. which I'm not interested in. When I purchase a Pilate workout, I want a Pilate workout.

I absolutely love Denise Austin's Pilates Mat Workout Tape.  Her soothing voice and instruction are exactly what I'm looking for.  Not someone ""barking"" out instruction with the beating of annoying drums in the background.

1230916,4,B00000IXOG,"This video has four 15 minute segments for toning. There are segments for arms, abs, hips and thighs:

The arm segment focuses on 2-3 pound hand weights (or soup cans if you are just starting) and working on repetition. After you do the standing section there is a floor section and some stretching to fill out the 15 minutes.

The abs section is done mostly on the floor and focuses on breathing while doing the exercises correctly. You do not need any equipment for this section. There is some back work here as well and some stretching to fill out the 15 minutes.

The hips and thighs sections are very similar. Neither require any equipment. Both have some classical standing ballet (you may want to use a chair for balance if first starting out though) and some yoga/pilates moves that go through a standing-plank-moves-standing routine that is not as challenging as it looks. They both finish off with almost the same floor work (leg circles, point up and flex downs, and finishes with stretching.

Jennifer Kries is a great teacher. She teaches you about breathing and technique, most of the time. She doesn't cue great, but a few times through the video and it's very easy to pick up.

1230942,5,B00000IXOG,"Jennifer Kries has created a challenging intermediate to advanced workout in response to requests for workouts to address specific areas of the body. If you are looking for a great full-body workout, you can do all four workouts one after the other. If you are short on time or just want to work on one area of your body, you can choose from four workouts:

Abs (15 minutes)
Arms (15 minutes) - Need 1-3lb weights
Hips (15 minutes)
Thighs (15 minutes)

You will recognize many of the signature ""Method"" postures and exercises in this workout, however there are quite a few surprises. Not only are all the exercises even more precise than before, they seem to be the ""next"" challenge. The pace is slightly faster at times and the ""d'gag'"" reaches a new level of intensity.

Some of the Exercises:

The Hundred
Roll-Up
Leg Circles
Rolling Like a Ball
Double-Leg Lower Lift
CrissCross
Active Moving Cat
Active Cat with Yoga Press
Down Dog
Exercises from the Side Series for Legs
Swimming
Sun Salutation
Standing Sculpting Series
Chest Expansion
Boxing
Pli' Series (makes you feel like you are doing ballet)

It is helpful to have Jennifer Kries' new book: Pilates Plus Method to learn the names of all her exercises and read the finer details of how your body should feel as you work through each exercise.

""Try to feel as if you were pushing your foot through the sand on the beach, moving with great resistance."" (from her new book)

There is hardly time to give extra advice, but Jennifer still manages to give you tips throughout this workout. If you have been doing her exercise videos over the years you will almost ""hear her advice in your mind"" as you go through the exercises.

If you are just starting to exercise with Jennifer Kries try:

The Method - Pilates: Precision Sculpting (1996)
The Method - Pilates: Precision Toning (1996)
The Method - All in One Workout (1997)
The Method - Precision Yoga (1998)
Pilates Method and 3-Dimensional Toning Box Set (2002)

The Method Pilates ""Target Specifics"" seems to be the most advanced workout I've tried so far when I do all four sections in one hour. If you can make it through the list above, you are ready for this workout. Once you complete Target Specifics, you will reach a new level of confidence and fitness. For me, this was the next level in my Pilates practice. The drums keep you motivated and keep you at the pace you need to be to burn those calories! Definitely an intermediate to advanced workout.

If you are just starting to do Pilates, it might be difficult to learn the moves and keep up with the fast pace. Start with some of the slower paced workouts from 1996 and learn the basics. I'd also recommend finding the Winsor Pilates workouts because they are excellent for anyone who is just discovering these amazing exercises.

Results from The Method workouts include:

Flat, firm stomach without having to do sit-ups or crunches
Defined buns without lunges
Sculpted Legs without bouncy aerobic exercises
Tones arms without heavy weights
Improved posture and flexibility. Even your feet become more flexible.
Mind and Body Healing - Your mind becomes calm and your body feels invigorated.

If you are looking for a Pilates/Ballet/Yoga challenge, this is it.

1230944,5,B00000IXOG,"This is the first time I've used the Pilates Method to work out. I simply adore it. I thought this was a nice, easy break from my running/stairmonster routine; when I first followed the tape (which gets easier each time), I thought, ""No big deal, I won't be sore. This was an easy workout!""  Then I got up the next morning and was really surprised. This was the easiest workout that I've ever done and gotten such amazing results. I felt the difference and my posture and back pain have been better as a result. I used to hunch over a computer all day, yet now I sit up straight without even thinking about it. The workout is a great way to wake up: stretching and getting the mind going.  Go for it! Get taller and leaner. If you hate it, your loss--send it to a friend. She will probably love you for it!

1230945,1,B00000IXOG,"I ABSOLUTELY hated this video. Jennifer flies through the video never concentrating on poise and position, which is MOST important when doing yoga and pilates. The tape is more concerned with ""looking the part"" of a yoga tape than giving you a strong base knowledge to take away from it. I would never work out to this tape again. There are a lot of pilates tapes on the market, I would suggest buying any other one but this one.",1073865600,2,429,4.443037974683544
1230946,5,B00000IXOG,"This DVD is comprised of four parts totalling almost an hour.  Although it's fun to do half of it or just one part, I like doing the whole workout because of the different exercises and variety.
The arms, abs, hips, thighs are worked.  She mixes some yoga moves with pilates and ballet, for a mix of standing and mat work.  I like this for ballance and core strenth and arm toning, but it is not a traditional pilates workout do to the mix.  If you like variety this is good for you.  You don't need a mat if you have carpet.
When I finish I feel as though I have had a good workout.  If you need moderate cardio training or more, you need something else.  Although you do burn a lot of calories doing the exercises, your heart needs a heavier workout a couple times a week to stay healthy.
The arm segment uses light 2 or 3 lb weights, although you could use heavier or none at all using resistance.  The background music is on bongo drums like a tribal sound, so that can get a tiny bit irritating, but not too bad.
This is a good dvd to have in your collection in my opinion because it is a good workout, exercising your entire body, introduces some yoga, ballet and pilates as well as weights so a beginner can catch on easily but the intermediate person to advanced level can also have fun.  I enjoy the workout, especially when I don't have enough energy for a hard core workout or if you just want to crawl out of bed and wear your pj's, as it's barefoot, low impact, and great if you have injuries or just need some variety.
I'd buy it again.  I'd probably give it 4.5 stars if that was an option.",1069804800,2,1605,4.198697068403908
1230947,5,B00000IXOG,"I was happy when I picked up this DVD to find that it is not as long as the Pilates All In One Work out (which was an hour and a half!) - this work out squeezes all the necessary exercises into one hour... anything that saves me time is a good thing!
Starts off: 15 Minutes of Abdominal exercises (they really work.. they helped me lose my baby belly after I had my daughter)They are pretty difficult, though. I found that it took me a long time to be able to do these exercises without taking breaks. But you know it's working 'cause you can already feel the burn 30 seconds into the workout!
Then 15 minutes of arms - this really helps you tone up your arms... but don't expect to really bulk up. This is just a basic beginners work out to keep the extra skin from flapping underneath your arms - you won't become a body builder from this! They are not very difficult at all.. even if you have no strength training experience at all, you should be able to do these... you may have to take short breaks here and there, but keep up with it and you'll get better.
Then 15 minutes of hips, which is great because it's always been my ""problem area"" and there aren't that many exercises out there that specifically target the hip area. This work out helps my jeans and skirts fit so much better and makes me feel much better about the way I look! They're a little difficult at first, but if you keep with them you will get better and be able to do them!
Then last is 15 minutes of thighs which are all standing and floor exercises target to your thigh area to help tone and strengthen to help you shed fat, flab, and inches. They are difficult... I've heard that your thigh area is the hardest area on the human body to tone and keep toned - I don't disagree. These exercises are very challenging, but start off at your own pace and you will gradually get better and better.
I try to do this work out 3-5 times a week, depending on my schedule... It has really helped keep me in good shape. it's especially great to own if you're like me - I'm a stay at home mom and I don't have the luxury of being able to leave my house multiple times a week so that I can work out, and I don't have very much free time on my hands.
So, I put this dvd in when the kids are napping and I get in a good work out and then shower... saves much more time (and money!)than heading out to a gym.
If you're serious about finding a routine that you want to stick to, then I recommend this video.
If you're looking to burn a lot of fat though (say over ten pounds) you're going to also have to get an aerobics dvd also, there are no aerobic exercises on here. Just muscle and strength training.",1069718400,,2666,4.128846153846154
1230948,4,B00000IXOG,"I've tried two other Method tapes and this is my favorite. The tape is broken down into four 15 minute segments, devoted to abs, arms, hips, and thighs. The abs section draws mainly from pilates, while the arms utilizes light weights. I took years of ballet as a kid, so I liked that the tape incorporated quite a few classical ballet moves (specifically in the hips and thighs segments).
As other reviewers have mentioned, the workout is quick and seems hurried (especially at the end of the thighs segment). However, I find that when I'm pressed for time, popping in the tape is an easy way to get a short workout in. I did not find it to be difficult. If you are a beginner and unused to ballet, it might take awhile to get the routine down, but once you know what is coming you will be able to focus more on the moves and see quick improvement.
Some reviewers mentioned that the music was distracting and this is a valid criticism. However, you can use this to build your concentration skills. When doing the movements, you should always be concentrating on your body and your own process. By focusing inward, your workout (though short) will be greatly enhanced.
In summary, though the tape has its faults, in the end it is a good toning routine. I would definitely recommend it.",1067212800,3,1284,4.538793103448276

Jennifer Kries is one of the few intructors I don't think is a total cheese ball and she often reminds you of proper position, breathing, etc.
The only draw back (yet I still give it 5 stars) is that the work-outs are pretty fast paced and she doesn't have time to really go into the importance of alignment and balance - I would suggest that beginners get a book to go along with it or take a class. I took a pilates class shortly after beginning using the DVD and found that the few sessions with an instructor really enhanced the work I did at home.

If you are short on time the 15 minute workout segments are perfect.
The excerises are easy to follow and after a few times you will begin to memorize the positions in their order. Jennifer Kries does 2 to 4 reps not sets of each position, emphasizing on quality not quantity. Doing 4 positions correctly is much more effective than doing 12 and losing your form once you begin to fatigue midway through.
I gave this video a 4 star rating because the first 2 15 minute workouts are really for beginners and the last 2 are for intermediate to advanced. The last 2 workouts have positions that are harder and require more strength and flexibility.
Other than that this is a good workout video.",1046131200,7,754,4.510948905109489
1230963,3,B00000IXOG,I liked the background music. this is a good tape for low impact days between heavy workouts.  sometimes she changes activities too quickly before you get a change to really work into it. Some of the rolling movements are hard on the back. The ballet work is a great conditioner for the legs. I enjoy the format.,1042848000,,312,4.473684210526316
1230964,5,B00000IXOG,"This is the first Pilates exercise video I have tried and I can't recommend it enough! I have twin sons but I always seem to be able to squeeze in one or two of the 15 minute segments a few times a week. I love the way I feel both during and after the workout . . . great toning and stretching and I actually find myself sweating! My one and only suggestion would be to add a tutorial to the DVD for users new to The Method and also to explain the breathing techniques all at once, rather than having to view them before each segment. I have at least a dozen exercise tapes but this is definitely my favorite!",1039392000,4,609,4.041322314049586
1230965,5,B00000IXOG,I love this video!  I love that it is split up into four sections.  Each section is made to work out a specific body part-but you're really working out everything.  It is really good if you just have 15-20 minutes in the morning/evening and you want to do something to get your energy up-or you just want to work out.  J. Kries is wonderful-my mother is 55 years old and I have to beg her not to steal the video when she comes and visits.,1037145600,4,438,4.117647058823529
1230966,2,B00000IXOG,"Unlike many people, I'm not a big fan of Jennifer Kries.  This is the second of her workouts I've bought, and I won't be buying more.  I found the mixture of instruction to actual work to be frustrating -- I'd be ready to flow on to the next exercise, and she'd be standing there telling me about it.  This is very useful the first few times through (proper alignment and breathing are essential, after all), but I'd like to just do the exercises straight through after I learn them.
Kries's narration is sometimes uneven, and her explanations aren't always that clear.  Her attitude and that of her fellow dancers isn't terribly energizing or even interesting.  I don't want peppy or cheery, but none of them look much like they're even enjoying themselves!  They make Kathy Smith look absolutely hyper.
I also found the 15-minute segments too short -- I prefer 20 to 60-minute workouts that work my whole body rather than 15 minutes on just one area.  That's completely a preference issue, though, and doesn't reflect on the quality of the workouts.
To make a short story long, I own upwards of 40 other aerobics/yoga/pilates/FIRM videos and DVDs, and this is the one I play the least.",1031011200,4,1187,4.705314009661835
1230967,5,B00000IXOG,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is not for beginners.  But, if you've already done Precision Pilates Toning, Sculpting or any of the other Precision Mix videos, this is an excellent workout because it's fast paced.  I know that during the workout my heart rate goes up & the fast pace keeps me alert.  Also, even if this is a fast workout Jennifer's instructions are detailed.  Do this tape 3 times a week, you'll get used to the routines & for sure you'll get results!  If you want a slower pace & you have a lot of time, try Target Zone.",1029888000,3,550,4.300970873786408
1230968,5,B00000IXOG,"I love The Method tapes, and this is a great addition to a workout video collection.
The tape has four 15 minute sections dedicated to ""Target Specifics,"" go figure. They have very little warm-up, and the slightest hint of a cool down, but that seems mainly because of the prohibitive 15 minute length of the sections. They are a perfect addition to an aerobic workout, and can be rotated throughout the week.
Abs: The core of Pilates based instruction seems to be promoting a strong center, and Jennifer Kries promotes your strong center through use of slow steady movement that is not overly repetitive, but is definitely effective. Some of the exercises are more challenging than others, but they are all easily explained and understandable. The workout also includes some back strengthening, though not a great deal.
Arms: The arms section uses light hand weights in a highly effective manner, adding self-created resistance to increase the work load as necessary. Again, the slow, steady movement with easily understandable instructions makes the arm workout both easy to learn and very effective.
Hips: Ballet work and Pilates make up the Hips section. A little training in dance would help maintain proper alignment and form, though most of the exercises can be done easily with out any formal training. This is my favorite way of working the hips and leg region, as the movements tend to make you feel more flexible and the muscles longer and stronger with very little impact on the joints.
Thighs: The first half of the thighs workout works my upper body more than my thighs, mostly because my thighs are much strong than my arms, and both are being used during the Sun Salutations and other yoga poses that make up the first half. The poses are fairly easily understood, but they feel a little hurried the first few times through. The second half makes you feel the burn if the first didn't, as it includes several lunges, squats and other thigh strengthening exercises. None done too often, and all very effective.
I would not recommend this video as a primary workout video, nor is it intended to be one. It is an excellent time sensitive toning video, and I've often substituted its toning section for other video's.",1024876800,10,2229,4.868421052631579
1230979,4,B00000IXOG,I recently bought this video and the first time I did it I was feeling sore muscles that I never knew I had.  It is working great for firming up and becoming more flexible.  Sometimes I bring my VCR to work with me when my boss is out of the office and I can do a 15 minute segment or the whole tape if I have time.

1230980,5,B00000IXOG,"Am a big video workout fan (videos for cardio/kickboxing, weight training, yoga/pilates) -- by far the Method videos are the best in my opinion and Target Specifics is my favourite. Been using it for two years and now I go through the entire tape with my eyes closed. I feel toned, stretched, massaged and meditated by the time its over. What a treat. I have to push myself to do the other workouts before I reward myself with Target Specifics. For me, it's an experience, not a workout -- sometimes I even use a candle and incense. And the drum music helps carry me through the whole thing. Give it a chance - it takes time to get to the point where you can close your eyes, use her cues, the music and your focus/breath to finish the workout feeling great. I believe Jennifer Kries is the best instructor/gives the best cues of anyone on a workout video that I have ever encountered (I have at least 30 exercise videos as I have tried to find ones that I will use more than once or twice).",999648000,4,991,4.333333333333333
1230981,4,B00000IXOG,"I decided to try a Jennifer Kries tape as a way to start learning some of the Pilates techniques. I come to this without a background in dance, yoga or Pilates. This tape has been a good introduction, I think. It is the kind of workout that always allows for modifications for those of us that are less flexible.
The only technical difficulty is that the drums sometimes compete with Kries, sound-wise. They never actually drown her out, though.
The set is attractive, the people inspirational (I want to be able to stretch like that!) and the music is fun.
Thumbs up!",994896000,3,568,4.578431372549019
1230982,2,B00000IXOG,"I was disappointed with this video.  There is no emphasis on form or Pilates' philosophy.  The women in the video are super flexible and are able to contort their bodies in ways that would be impossible for 99.99% of the population.  It is fascinating to see, but difficult to follow, since they don't show you what the movements would look like when done by someone with normal flexibility.  I would imagine that trying to copy these women (ie, laying your shin flat across your chest) could lead to injury.  Also, the music, which consisted of 4 drum beats repeated over and over and over, was like an excruciating torture.  Whatever were they thinking of?",994291200,2,658,4.728070175438597
1230983,5,B00000IXOG,"What an awesome video. I was having trouble losing body fat, and in a week I noticed a difference. I have many other excercise tapes, and this one is completely different! I feel as though I'm being hipnotized with the drum music and Jennifer's voice. Excercising is actually relaxing! and now more than ever I WANT to excercise. I feel as though if I don't do my 15,20,45 min., whatever I'm able to that morning I'm not in sinc for the day. I HIGHLY recommend The Method tapes for those having trouble losing weight! It's a different way of excercising and you are never bored even within a 15min. segment-you actually want to do more!",993168000,8,636,4.539130434782609
1230984,4,B00000IXOG,"The four different 15 minute workouts on this tape are great.  They develop flexibility and strength in the usual ""problem"" areas and are fun to do.  One 15 minute segment is the perfect start for the day and you can alternate them--with four you can't get bored too fast.
Jennifer is a good instructor, not cheesy and grinning all the time.  I enjoyed the background drums music--they help me concentrate and follow the pace of the exercise.
My only somewhat negative comment is that sometimes you feel rushed to get to the next exercise.  Of course, that is the trade off of fitting a workout in 15 minutes.",992822400,6,609,4.611111111111111
1230985,3,B00000IXOG,"I've been doing Yoga for a few months and thought that I could tone up a bit more by using the Pilates method.  I bought an excellent book, The Pilates Body, by Brooke Siler but thought seeing the positions would help me do them accurately (it's hard to read a series of instructions and exercise at the same time).  As other people here said, this is not a video for the beginner - but it was the only Pilates tape in the store.  I have pretty good flexibility and balance but couldn't do the dance-based hip exercises well, and Jennifer & co. move much too quickly for me. I don't think I'm really learning much about Pilates from this particular video, but I do enjoy the instructor and even the music which I found oddly calming.  I'm sure this would be a good workout for the initiated, and having the exercises broken up into different segments is great if you just want a 15 minute workout on specific areas.  I will purchase another Method tape to try to get the basics down.",984873600,20,983,4.3791208791208796
1230986,5,B00000IXOG,"I had purchased the Precision toning and was happy with it but felt I needed a shorter program.  I exercise everyday and doing it for 45 was too long.  The target specifics is exactly what I wanted.  I usually do two (15 minute) workouts each day.  I have tried every exercise and I do believe what works for some might not work well for others.  While I believe you should do a variety of exercise, I am sticking with the Method.  Only after 2 weeks I am starting to see shape to my legs and hips and arms and finally my stomach.  I believe it is because The Method uses deep muscle training.  I love the drumming in the video it takes you mind off of an exercise being too difficult to do.  Jennifer Kries is an excellent instructor, you can tell from her voice how much energy and vitality she has.  Happy with my new found exercise program.",982108800,8,844,4.251572327044025
1230987,5,B00000IXOG,"I love this video! I have used if for nearly a year, and I am more flexible and stronger than I ever have been. Jennifer Kries is an encouraging instructor who isn't annoying. She explains and demonstrates the movements very thoroughly, but she doesn't yell or talk to you like you're a child. And she's honest. I bought 4 more method videos with her based on this one alone. The 4 15min segments are perfect for beginners. For more advanced, you could do more than one segment at a time. The abs work truly is nothing like you've ever seen, and it will work muscles you didn't know existed. The arms and legs work is great too. A unique muscle toning tape that you will go back to over and over again. Strength training without the weights is the concept here, and it works.

Some of the  moves are familiar, from the Precision Toning or Precision Sculpting  videos, but I highly recommend buying this as it is a great way to  ""piece"" out specific body parts.
The Hips segment is more  focused on ballet moves and stretches and also some bits of yoga, while the  Thighs segment is yoga dominant (sun salutations, lunges, awkward chair).  Each segment moves and while you sweat, you stretch and get that  Pilates/Yoga ""bliss"" as well.",963792000,16,662,4.559322033898305

Dear Cal Pozo, or whoever you are, Pilates and Yoga are supposed to be calm, intense, but mindful workouts, so that you tone up and get strong, but don't injure yourself doing them.
