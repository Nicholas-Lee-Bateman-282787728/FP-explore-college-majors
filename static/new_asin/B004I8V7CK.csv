And it even plays on USA devices as it shares the region with Japan. The overall quality is fantastic. It's a limited run, so the price is high, but as a fan of the show, this is the best way to go. My own delivery was super quick, and the packaging was very secure.",1461715200,,437,3.9213483146067416

Why one star missing? Because it was REALLY overpriced but I don't blame. The original distributors of this closed in 2011 and ceased print of this. Tt cost me around $550 NZD. It was a bit of a gamble but I really love Lucky Star. If you love the show you'll feel good owning this but that's my personal opinion. In the end I'm rather happy with what I bought.",1438646400,,528,4.186274509803922
8506178,5,B004I8V7CK,"Edit: I feel obliged to clarify a few things this blu ray set DOES COME I repeat DOES COME with the ENGLISH DUB and subtitles also this blu ray should play just fine on any American ps3 and any American blu ray player since the USA and Japan use region A/1 for blu rays any blu ray from Japan should work fine in the USA. I add this edit as I read some other reviewer claimed that this set didn't come with the English dub which isn't true. I hope this edit helps anyone wondering about the english dub being present on the blu ray.

Let's make things very clear yes this is an expensive product. If you are looking to get this set most likely you are a fan of lucky star and you know the show is amazing. I'll say this, it was because of this show (since I bought the Anime Legends dvd of this show on a whim) that got me back on anime so giving the product a bad review just because of its price is a disservice to the show.

The quality is superb it contains all of the episodes plus the ova and the concerts plus extra videos (note the ova and the other features do not come with english dub or English subtitles) also it comes with the original Japanese language as well as the English dub for the main episodes. The menus are in Japanese (but if you have a PlayStation 3 you can use the ""triangle button menu"" and change everything that way) to be honest this box set was created for the hardcore fans or anime fans who like to own their anime on the highest quality possible.
Yes it Is expensive but is also worth it and considering the fact that Bandai in the USA stop the production of the dvds of lucky star and seeing how the less available it becomes the more it will cost then this box set doesn't seem that bad of an investment look at the prices for a brand new lucky star dvd collection on amazon it ranges from 90 to 300 dollars at that price range why not splurge a little more and treat yourself to a higher quality version of an anime very deserving of the title ""Anime Legends""",1384041600,6,1998,4.133676092544987
8506179,5,B004I8V7CK,"First of all, this box set is a extremely limited run.  I don't think its being made any more.

Second,  it is a official English subbed bluray.

I have seen this box set going for 500 or more on other sites.  You have to think.  Japanese blu rays go for on average of 50-70 dollars.  New shows are about 70-90 $.  So getting this box set at 300 is good price.  Im currently in Japan.  I've seen the prices.",1376006400,5,407,4.037974683544304
8506180,1,B004I8V7CK,"This price point is insane! $309.55 works out to $13.28 per episode. Come back down to earth and it will sell like hotcakes, or onigiri... whatever.",1373673600,12,148,4.730769230769231
