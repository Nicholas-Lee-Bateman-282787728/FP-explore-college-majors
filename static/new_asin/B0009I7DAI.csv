I did not want to read or buy a book on the Tarot, so programs fit the bill. Both DVDs had graphics just like a book and explained the symbolism of the cards (1st DVD) or how to read the Tarot intuitively (2nd DVD) and both had sample spreads.

Really, the woman who teaches on camera speaks fine, if she spoke any faster, it would be like a used car salesman.

I have found that most how to DVDs are like books and that's the way they should be. They are for people that do not want to read or have the time to read, but want the information explained to them or maybe they are even dyslexic.

I can say if you are an advance card reader both DVD's content probably not for you.

2291138,1,B0009I7DAI,"IF I could have given this video a -5 I would. This  video is absolutely boring . I do have to agree with the other persons review about the speed at which  this woman is talking. It's as though she trying to talk as slow as possible in order to take up as much room on the tape as she can.

 The other problem I have with this video is the fact that  it's set up almost like a book. If I wanted to read a book I would have gotten a book. I don't like how they show each card on the screen and then put the definition beside it. I felt it was just too much like a book and they completely ran out of ideas. Please save your money. This video wasn't worth the high cost. I think I""ll try to sell mine as soon as I can. I'm so disgusted and disappointed with it.",1121385600,13,760,3.7848101265822787
2291139,1,B0009I7DAI,"I have been buying from Amazon for years, and this is the first review I'm posting, because I want to warn others that this DVD is absolutely terrible! It's cheezy beyond belief, and the woman who narrates is SO slow, and sounds like she could be reading from one of those booklets that comes inside a tarot pack. The ""sample spreads"" are ridiculous...they give nothing interesting, just the absloute most obvious and simplistic information. Please, spare yourself. I thought a DVD might be more ""entertaining"" than a book, but boy, was I wrong.",1121040000,17,545,4.870967741935484
2291140,5,B0009I7DAI,I would suggest buying this video to anybody who is interested in learning about symbolism on tarot decks and want to have or give stronger readings. It will really amaze you.  It has helped my readings a great deal. Graphics of the cards on the video are wonderful and easy to see and understand. And just a lot of information throughout the whole video.  You could look at the video everyday for a year and learn something new about the tarot. Morgan is great just like on her 1st one.,997056000,22,487,4.4
8061053,3,B0009I7DAI,So boring and difficult to watch nice and informative but I really wish it was easier to watch,1411084800,,94,4.277777777777778
8061054,2,B0009I7DAI,I was so completely disappointed by the first volume that I haven't mustered any interest in opening this one- sorry.,1374105600,,117,4.9
8061055,4,B0009I7DAI,"It is so hard to find something that covers all the symbolism.  Until there is something.... this is a great start!  I watched this quite a bit, it really glues it into your mind when you are watching the symbols light up on the cards.",1371254400,,235,4.2
8061056,5,B0009I7DAI,"I had already purchased and watched the first DVD by Ms Ki'ilehua and was quite pleased with it, so I decided to order this DVD Symbolism of the Tarot. As usual, I read the reviews before I purchase and admit I was somewhat apprehensive after reading a couple 1 star reviews, claiming the DVD was boring, and lacked any significant teachings. I followed my instinct and ordered it anyway. I have just finished watching it and I now wonder ""What morons gave this DVD negative ratings?"" I have other tarot DVDs and this series is the cream of the crop. If you have a serious interest in Tarot, I highly suggest both DVDs in this series.",1265068800,,634,4.474137931034483
8061057,5,B0009I7DAI,"I was very impressed with this DVD, and I have watched it many times. Some very helpful information, and it helped me to have a better understanding.
Thank you for making this DVD, and I wish you would make more.

8061058,5,B0009I7DAI,"If you are an absolute beginner like me, this is great. If you are more advanced, this is probably not for you, as another reviewer said. I love the tarot lessons, and I think that for newbies the pace is just fine. However, what I love this dvd for even more, is the music in the beginning. I know the fake moon and stars background is kind of corny, but the music is absolutely wonderful. I pop this dvd in before bed and fall asleep to the music. I know that is not what this dvd was intended to be for. But that music has been helping me fall asleep since I purchased this two years ago. I wonder if maybe she should have made a meditation cd instead of a tarot lessons dvd.",1246752000,,678,4.067164179104478
8061059,4,B0009I7DAI,"This DVD is OK, provided you know what you're getting.  Having just watched it, here's what I would tell you:

This is only about the symbolism in the 22 Major Arcana cards.
It does not cover the 56 other cards.
It does not teach you how to do spreads.
It does not teach you how to read tarot.

As long as you realize this, then it's a good video.  Each of the 22 cards gets a brief explanation, and then the card is shown full-frame with each item in the picture highlighted and explained.  For THE FOOL card (shown on box cover), the sun, the cliff, the white rose, the belt, the coat, the wreath on his head, the jumping white dog, the feather, the wand in his hand, and the wallet at the end of the wand are all explained for their symbolic meaning (and I may be forgetting a few).  This is done for each Major Arcana card.

My only complaint is the sleepy new-age music in the background, which is way too loud relative to the speaker.

Running time on the video is 59 minutes.",1239148800,4,982,4.1861702127659575
8061060,5,B0009I7DAI,"I suppose some people found this DVD unhelpful. But, to those of you who are picking up the Tarot for the first time these two DVD's are extremely beneficial. She does not talk to fast. If she talked any faster I would have had to rewind. The key point that is so helpful, is that why she is talking she has a card up in the upper left hand corner of her screen - and as she talks she highlights certain parts of the card and explains to you the meaning of why the image is there. She lays out spreads and shows you how to do a mechanical reading and then using the same cards shows you how it would look intuitively - which I found very helpful. I believe her method of teaching was refreshing and will help others too, in further understanding their own spreads. I suppose it's mainly meant for beginners, though I don't feel I'm a beginner and I felt I received wonderful information that was very enlightening. It also gave me insights into certain cards that I had not thought of myself. Out of all the Tarot books I've read to-date I would highly recommend: Joan Bunning's - Learning the Tarot - as she not only gives lessons and exercises in her book to practice, along with a page devoted to each card - her book (in full) is online as well, so you can print out the exercises which is very beneficial. Also, if you check with Barnes and Nobles they offer a FREE online course that uses this same book and further helps you in your studies, with support and students too boot, all for free. However, with all of these tools, the Tarot is still a very difficult study for so many, which is the reason so many give up. These two DVD's offer insights that the free B&N course and books don't give you. And to boot they give you a feeling of sitting with a professional reader that you won't get from any book. I believe these two DVD's complimented the Joan Bunning approach and taught me new ways of viewing the Tarot. I highly recommend both DVD's. Most Tarot courses tell you not to stop your studies with their book, so to me I found these three courses most helpful as the free online course (which I think comes out each spring), but you have to check B&N for the dates, gives you support from other beginning students the book is online and follows the course and these two DVD's give you new and exciting insights - personally after all my studies these are the three things I would recommend for beginners as they all compliment each other, and all offer something different. Good luck and may the Spirit of the Tarot guide you to the books and programs that will best help you become the best Tarot Reader you can be... Also, you can probably find the dates from Joan Bunning's website on when B&N is offering the free Tarot course better then searching the B&N sight for it, as they only offer that 30 days before it is do out, and Joan Bunning's site is more up to date.",1171670400,8,2887,4.318600368324125
8061061,4,B0009I7DAI,"The video may not be to everyone's taste, but it is not intended for entertainment.  The ""instructor"" walks us through the major arcana cards, giving insight into all the details and what they may represent.  After going through the major arcana, she introduces the minor arcana cards as she sets out several sample readings. She talks about the individual cards as she lays them out and then summarizes the indications of the spread as a whole. I will be watching my copy again and next time will take notes.",1141689600,17,509,4.707865168539326
