1662685,4,B00005TPCB,"One of the few So Smart videos we appreciate most.  I had a difficult time holding my son's attention in teaching him a few words to start with.  I came across with this video in the libray and gave it a try.  I was amazed with the way they introduced words to the young minds.  Great illustrations, clear pronunciation, and soothing classical music.  It instantly set the mood for learning.  I was even drawn to the video watching it with my son.  I repeat after the narrator to encourage my son to speak it and familiarize him with the 28 words & subjects found in the video.  These are dog, cat, bug, car, moon, shoe, hat, phone, keys, truck, train, boat, sun, tree, bird, flower, bear, banana, chair, book, up, spoon, paper, crayon, lamp, house, star.  Pretty good for starters.  A great treat of stories while introducing to new but familiar words.  I would highly recommend this.",1118793600,,885,4.573248407643312
1662686,4,B00005TPCB,"This is one of the few So Smart videos that has words spoken.  Here's basically how it goes.  It begins with a ball and you hear a pleasant voice say, ""Ball.  A ball bounced up and down and rolled away.  Ball.""  Next you see a dog and you hear the voice say,  ""Dog.  Woof says the dog.  The dog wags his tail and follows the ball.  Dog.""

The only thing I didn't really like was that there were no words shown on the screen.  Most of the other So Smart videos don't have words spoken but they show the words on the screen.  This one could have done both, but they left the words off.  The peoples faces are so much better then the first So Smart videos.  There are 28 words taught and they are ball, dog, cat, bug, car, moon, shoe, hat, phone, keys, truck, train, boat, sun, tree, bird, flower, bear, banana, chair, book, up, spoon, paper, crayon, lamp, house, star.

As a side point, my baby is 19 months and has been watching Signing Time since she was 9 months (Signing Time teaches hearing kids American Sign Language and it's awesome!!).  What is so cool is that all the words on this So Smart First Words video we also know in sign language.  So, it's a fun way to practice our ASL while watching this video.  I have reviewed all the other So Smart videos (and many others) so please be sure to read those too.",1116028800,8,1316,4.196
1662687,1,B00005TPCB,"I bought this item used, and good thing I didn't pay full price!  I wanted to try something new, we have a couple baby einsteins and a brainy baby.  I thought this would be GREAT.  I was WRONG.  The cartoon graphics are terrible, I can't even figure out what they are supposed to be.  You'd have to be a GENIUS - not just so smart - to figure out what the pictures are before the voice over tells you.  The pace is SO SLOW that my 11 month old lost interest - I lost interest.  There is NO music to captivate him and the voice is so monotonous.  There is even a disclaimer in the beginning saying that it's 30 min long, but your baby will tell you when it's time to move onto another activity.  Well that happened instantly.  I would not buy any more of this series if they are all of this poor quality.  This is my first review on anything online, and I have to warn you against this purchase.",1067990400,6,894,4.080459770114943
1662688,5,B00005TPCB,I bought this DVD for my daughter when she was 12 months hoping she would be interested in it.  It wasn't until around a year and a half that she actually started to sit through it. Now she is captivated. All she wants to do is learn new words so she loves this video.  It isn't a bunch of lights and music like other videos but rather slow paced and calm. It is perfect for quiet down time at night and she really does learn the words.,1045526400,2,436,4.0

I'm sure this is to capture a baby's visual interest, but my son doesn't understand why this dog doesn't look like a dog!

However my child loves all of them. They have simple stories, great art and music that helps a child calm down. As a teacher I see great benefit in teaching children basic understanding of their little world. Of course playing, building blocks and using their imagination doesn't replace this, but I believe that would have never been the designers intention and most parents are smart enough to get that and look beyond marketing.",1328054400,2,583,4.782178217821782

1662710,5,B00005TPCB,"I saw these DVDs in our local discount store on a couple of occasions but was reluctant to buy them as they seemed too simplistic, even for my autistic 3 year olds.  But recently I picked up a couple of episodes just to refresh our DVD time and boy, was I surprised!  One of my sons became such a huge fan of ""Iggy"", the female pig, that my husband and I are joking that he is going to marry her when he grows up.  Every picture of a pig and toy pig became ""Iggy"".  My son requests me to draw ""Iggy"" on his Doodle Pro and find images of ""Iggy"" on the computer.  As for the DVD itself, it is requested every time we ask: ""What do you want to watch?""  When the DVD is on, my son forgets about everything else and watches it intensely from the beginning to the end and then asks for ""more Iggy"".  He learned many new words after the first time we watched it and uses them often now!  Needless to say, I had to order all the other episodes from ""First Word Stories"" and even decided to get ""Baby beginnings"".  My husband and I cannot wait until they arrive because we are watching the ones we have over and over!!!  I recommend ""So Smart"" series very highly!!!!",1279929600,3,1157,4.125
1662711,4,B00005TPCB,"We recently received 2 DVDs from So Smart! Since my daughter is 1 year old, they sent ""First-Word Stories: Outside"" and ""First-Word Stories: Pets"" for me (and my daughter, of course) to review. The First-Word Stories start out with words, then move on to sentences, and finish as a story. They re-cap the words at the end of each segment. You can also put the DVD in a computer and print off activity pages to go along with the stories, which is a great learning aid that many children's DVDs do not offer.

As soon as I started the ""First-Word Stories: Outside"" DVD, my daughter was up and dancing with the intro song which introduces the characters. There are 5 stories on each 30 minute DVD, so if you have a child that doesn't sit still for very long or if you prefer your child not watch 30 minutes at a time, they can watch individual short stories. I enjoyed the slow-paced music and stories (made so that parents can interact with their children), but it just didn't keep my daughters attention for very long; however, she would always come back to watch after a few minutes and generally seemed to enjoy the pictures and stories. I liked the fact that the DVD used normal, everyday words and sentences.

I think these are great learning DVDs, though maybe for a child slightly over 1 year.  These DVDs are GREAT for calm-down times (like before naptime or bedtime). After Sydney finished watching the DVD she was ready to cuddle up and take a nap!  I think it's great that these DVDs don't over-stimulate the child.",1268006400,2,1524,4.5510948905109485

I have tried Sesame Street, but he won't really look at it.  ""Outside"" engaged his interest immediately and held it for the whole dvd!  And the slow pace allows for me to talk about the story/characters/words while he still sees them.  So far, we have 2 in the series, but I'm going to get more!",1266278400,2,645,4.2727272727272725

I looked for just this type of thing when my oldest was at the stage, and never found anything so good and effective as this.  I am so glad to be able to buy these videos to share with my four year old (who is still only just starting to talk) as well as my more typically developing two-year-old.

1662715,5,B00005TPCB,"These videos are really great in that they support the language development of a child who is speaking individual words, but not sentences.  My boys have had problems with language development, so I have been looking for years to find videos on just this level- extra simple stories and sentences.  Most of what's out there is either language-rich ""Barney"" type series, or single-word series like Baby Einstien.  Other than the rather sparse Baby Bumblebee collection, this is the only series I've seen that's in the middle.

My kids love it and watch is a lot, and it does help them.  Both will say the words, and my older son (age four, speaks like early twos) will start putting two or three words together.  A very big deal for a concerned parent!

A video series can obviously only support professional and parental attention, but I would very much recommend this series for any parent whose child has learning or language delays.  It's also great for typically developing kids in the one to two year range.

I hope the makers of this series not only make more, but that they make a systematic, comprehensive attempt to introduce all the basic, everyday words and grammar that kids need in just this format.  It would be a big project with many videos, but so helpful.  I always wanted such a thing; previouis developmental series are not oriented this way at all, but are typically entertainment-oriented and prone to introduce words that are not very useful to a kid.",1258761600,6,1474,4.7637795275590555

Now I'm anxious to try the other games with her!  I wasn't impressed with the ""First Words Video"" part of the DVD at first, but if you watch it with the baby to ADD YOUR COMMENTS AND ENTHUSIASM (their comments are lousy; the pictures are very, very simple which I like because she can focus on learning one word at a time, but their dialogue is boring and does not focus on the one word.), and limit the time she watches it to 10-15 min, you get better results.

7953936,5,B00005TPCB,"My daughter was introduced to this series of dvds by accident. my sister purchased it at target. my daughter reacted so well to it i could not resist getting the collection: btw,  amazon has a better deal than the so smart website and target is always sold out. smh.  She has memorized all the vocabulary words and demands we follow all the characters actions. Great for a baby going into toddler stage. Gentle pace and simple graphics help her focus on what's being said. Very soothing. She still gets excited but not as much as she does with other programs which for me is a good thing. Too much screen time can aid in developing ADHD. And i am a hyper mom, no need for an extra hyper toddler. lol true story. Highly recommended. just do it. you won't regret it. my daughter even enjoys the baby sounds and shapes and etc... She says mommy its Mozart, and that's a violin. thank you so smart. Also,Thank you little Einsteins. lol.",1378771200,,932,4.476470588235294
