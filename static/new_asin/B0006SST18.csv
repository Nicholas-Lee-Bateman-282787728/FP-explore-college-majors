2194388,5,B0006SST18,"This film tells the early story of Cardinal Mindszenty's ordeal. Since it was made in 1950 shortly after his show trial and sentence to life in prison, it is incomplete. It could hardly be otherwise.

Mindszenty wasn't released from prison until the Hungarian upraising in 1956 and afterwards he was under voluntary house arrest at the American Embassy for years. The cardinal remained an icon of peaceful resistance to Communist tyranny and ultimately became an embarrassment to the Hungarian government that wanted to be rid of him. He was finally asked to leave Hungary by Pope Paul VI and he made his home in Vienna until his death in 1975, although he continued to speak out vigorously against Communism.

The movie is a real thriller, all the more because it is based on true events. Although the film could not tell the complete story since it had not yet played out, it demonstrated the courage and integrity of Cardinal Mindszenty. It also illustrated a different era when the press was interested in digging out the truth and proclaiming it to the world. One would have a hard time recognizing most of today's liberal journalists in Tom Kelly, the reporter in the movie.

One of the most interesting aspects of the film for me was the question of making a choice. Several characters have to decide where they will stand. The young Russian officer and the music teacher each is faced with a choice. Will they choose truth and goodness or go along with evil, either actively or passively? The same questions they faced face our own generation as we deal with moral issues like abortion, assisted suicide, and euthanasia. Where will we draw the line? Will we address the problems of our day with the character of Cardinal Mindszenty or that of the Russian bureaucrats?

It's a great film!",1291593600,16,1795,4.799352750809062
2194389,3,B0006SST18,"I was quite disappointed with this documentary/movie. It only told half of the story of Cardinal Josef Mindszenty's heroism and sanctity. It was very short and  ends by saying he was sentenced to prison. Nothing about his having been rescued from prison by freedom fighters, his boycott by the American Embassy staff, his removal from office as Cardinal by Pope Paul VI because he refused to keep silent on the evil of communism, and his courage, even in exile from his beloved Hungary, to travel the world and show everyone the true face of communism. I guess we will have to wait for someone like Mel Gibson to make such a movie on this truly holy Catholic martyr of the 20th Century.",1113955200,16,686,4.622950819672131
8042943,4,B0006SST18,"This is a full-on anti-Soviet propaganda film of the period. It is unfortunate how most of the world has forgotten the tragedy played upon Hungary in its revolt against totalitarianism, many brave and honorable souls were lost. This was a very engaging story and is in many ways relevant today.",1489190400,,294,4.9
8042944,5,B0006SST18,"Great Dialogue. Well written & played out. More of a Theatrical piece than a Movie. Knowing History, & being Literate  is a prerequisite to understanding the situation this Cardinal was placed in. That's probably too much to ask of ""movie fans"" in the currant era. That's why I like Amazon Prime!  Can still find good stories...",1472774400,,328,4.839285714285714

8042947,5,B0006SST18,"I always love watching movies like ""Guilty of Treason"".  This is a story of a mere man and others he influenced to serve God, in spite of the evil that wants to destroy Him.  These life experiences are really a wake up call for us not to take our Christian heritage for granted.  I would recommend everyone watch this, as times today seem to be moving away from righteous living, and we all need to make sure we are on solid ground, having such a faith in God, knowing thAt we too may someday, may be called upon  to stand up for our faith.  A must to see in order to remember there were those who sacrificed their lives for being a Christian.  If we should so be called upon to deny Christ, we will remember the men like these who did so willingly, saying ""they cannot take my life as I gave it to my Lord years ago.""",1458604800,2,818,4.113207547169812

8042952,5,B0006SST18,"This movie was made about the trial of Cardinal Mindszenty well before the 1956 Hungarian revolution, at a time when the man's ultimate destiny was not yet known.

The addition of historically inaccurate National Socialist scenes reveal the struggle of the of American propaganda machine which spent years convincing the American public that the Soviets were friends only to have to flip sides with the onset of the Cold War.

Mindszentiy's courageous stand contributed to the outbreak of the Hungarian uprising of 1956, which in turn served as an example for all other revolutionary movements in the Soviet Block, leading to the revolution of 1989, in which Hungarians broke the Iron Curtain and ended the Cold War. Because of this, Guilty of Treason remains a remarkable piece of 20th century history.",1353715200,4,803,5.122137404580153
