7470994,3,B016F7J9SU,"This was an interesting depiction of the life of Stanley Milgram. It is thought-provoking and interesting. The acting is well done and overall the quality of production was top-notch. It is great to see Winona Ryder whenever she does decide to be in a movie these days. However, the pace of the movie is slow. It is less a gripping tale of the perils of conformity (like I had thought it would be) and more of a documentary where the subject talks to you through the screen. While there's quite a bit of time spent on Stanley's personal life, it still doesn't feel personal. Also the scenes showing the experiments don't really seem all that gripping. Somewhere along the line, the creators of this movie really didn't have a firm vision of the focus of this film, which made the film fall flat. Knowing the details behind the experiments, I thought there was a lot of potential for conflict. As the film played out, it kind of volleyed back and forth between his personal life and the various experiments he was doing. The best part of this film is the last line. While I was expecting a story filled with tension and conflict, the overall feel of this film is more of a philosophical and thoughtful retrospective from the point of view of the scientist.",1445040000,5,1255,4.582222222222223

A reviewer criticized this film for not having a satisfying conclusion--that is merely a conversation starter. I would agree that this is exactly that--an introduction to an interesting, complex topic about both the method of the experimenter and the results, which the experimenter did not expect.

Considering what is happening today throughout the world, this film is both fascinating and timely. Made me want to explore Milgram's work in greater depth.",1472774400,,541,5.218390804597701

7471010,4,B016F7J9SU,"I rented this film without knowing anything about it or what to expect. I hoped it would be good because it stars the talented Peter Sarsgaard and Winona Ryder, and I was not disappointed. It is worth repeated viewings.

The film is based on the famous studies of American social pshychologist Stanley Milgram. Even though you may not know the name, you've likely heard or read of his tests and discoveries, as they have been used before in films and books. Even though his work was done in the 1960's-early 80's (he died in 1984, at the peak of his popularity), it is very relevant to our modern times. His studies are on social interaction (ex. ""six degrees of separation"", letters experiments, etc.) and his most famous studies, which this film is largely about, were called the ""obedience"" tests. These tests examine conformity and obedience issues, testing the will of the individual to obey rules that the person knows are wrong. The results of these tests reveal shocking truths about ourselves. Milgram's work set a standard that is often referred to again and again but has also endured its share of criticism.

Milgram's work forces us to think and question, and this film does the same. In doing so, the film is not simply a chronological dramatisation of his life. The film takes artistic liberties in its presentation, in the way images morph together, in the way black and white backdrops are used, in how the characters speak their inner dialogue directly to the camera, etc. It all makes for an interesting film, much more entertaining than the serious material it explores. Sarsgaard and Ryder do a wonderful job in the lead roles, and the supporting cast is also exceptional. It's cool how many other famous actors make brief appearances as Milgram's test subjects.

There are a few short bonus features included on the disc. One is an interview with Milgram's brother, who explains that he's happy with the film's depiction of his brother because it captures the person and shows his humanity and motivs better than any previous film or book about Milgram. Other features are about the making of the film and its settings and effects.

I learned a lot while watching this film. I was surprised at how much of Milgram's work I was already familiar with, but this film did a great job of explaining it and putting it into better and deeper perspective for me. I will likely buy the Blu-ray (when the price comes down).",1467331200,,2435,4.776722090261282
7471011,3,B016F7J9SU,"This is one of those movies that's more like a documentary, kinda dull, but would be interesting to people wanting to learn history of psychology.",1465689600,,146,4.88
7471012,5,B016F7J9SU,"Great movie - excellent quotes and words of wisdom. I enjoyed watching this movie - it was not suspenseful, it was not written as a drama or thriller -- it is more of an exquisite documentary (or rather, auto-biography) of a brilliant man. The only additional thoughts I had after, while watching the ending last few minutes, I began to wonder if the main character was ever truly happy in his life. He spent so much time watching and observing others, looking into others - but did he ever watch and observe his own life, and then actually be part of it?

One of my favorite quotes:
Stanley Milgram: I hit this line about child development. It's the specific point when the growing child is able to recognize a gap between what exists and what might exist. And it occurred to me, we choose our reality when we choose another person.
Alexandra 'Sasha' Milgram: What does that mean? Marriage is not a fantasy.
Stanley Milgram: No, no, no, right. Right. But it is a choice. You have to know that I choose you. Every day I choose you.

However if you are interested, I have started to read some criticism of the Milgram experiment here in this book :Behind the Shock Machine: The Untold Story of the Notorious Milgram Psychology Experiments by Gina Perry just before seeing the movie. To some extent it did change my perspective while watching this movie.

7471027,5,B016F7J9SU,"As Experimenter reminds us, the Stanley Milgrams experiment on obedience and authority is found in nearly every first year psychology textbook, but the influence of Milgrams work has spread much further than just the freshman college course. Its the kind of experiment that has taken hold of popular imagination in such a way that high school teachers across discipline drop it as a little bit of knowledge. Theres something about Milgrams experiment that makes for a great story. Its a narrative all its own that confirms our worst fears. It also happens to be the focus of Michael Almereydas biopic, Experimenter.

 Just a refresher: in Milgrams obedience experiment, an unsuspecting subject is asked to play the role of a teacher while a second individual, who is an actor aware of the ruse, plays the student. A man pretending to be a doctor, garbed in a lab coat, explains the rules of the experiment to the subject, and during the experiment, the doctor sits behind the subject and directs his or her actions. The subject/teacher is instructed to ask the student a series of questions--the student would essentially have to memorize and repeat the second word in a series of word pairs--and when the student chooses incorrectly, the subject must shock him with an increasing amount of voltage. Throughout the experiment, the student/actor feigns pain from his place in a separate room. Despite reservations, the vast majority of subjects administered the highest voltage.

 Experimenter is a surprisingly strong entry into that most maligned of genres: the biopic. The biopic has a reputation for being weepy Oscar bait at its absolute worst (see: the perfectly mediocre The Theory of Everything and the truly egregious The Imitation Game, exemplar of everything wrong with the genre). Biopics shouldnt be this awful. There are some fascinating people who have interesting lives and exist in interesting times. If I were to diagnose the problem with the biopic, it is that they skew too heavily towards telling us one man or womans story without regard to the larger context. Why do these people matter? What do they say about the times in which they lived? Not only do most biopics take these questions for granted, they also try to stuff a persons entire life into two hours, which is usually a fools errand.

 Along with End of the Tour and Love & Mercy, Experimenter slips the curse of the biopic by paying attention to questions that extend far beyond the life of a single man. Almereyda uses Milgrams life as a jumping off point to explore questions of power, authority, human plasticity, and authenticity. At times, the film feels more like a visual essay than a traditional film. Although screenwriting rules usually forbid voice-over and breaking the fourth wall may seem garish, Almereyda stuffs his film with both. Milgram himself becomes our Greek chorus, explaining his experiments, which are not limited to the one that made him famous, and leading us through his life.

 Because his voice accompanies us throughout the film, Peter Sarsgaard must do plenty of heavy lifting as Milgram. The role of Stanely Milgram provides a wonderful opportunity for an actor, and Sarsgaard takes full advantage of being front and center, addressing the audience for much of the films running time. Sarsgaard plays Milgram as hunched and observational. He rarely interacts with any of the subjects of his experiment, and his ability to speak to the camera gives him a sort of God-like authority. And yet, hes also unassuming. He may have a massive ego, but it has been honed by the rigors of scientific discourse.

 Sarsgaard also subtly plays Milgrams identity by ever so slightly incorporating a Jewish-American accent when hes alone with family and friends but hiding it when hes in a professional setting. As he mentions throughout the film, Milgram is the Yiddish word for pomegranate, one of the six fruits of the Hebrew Bible. Milgrams work was influenced the events of the Holocaust and Adolf Eichmanns trial in Jerusalem, an event that would lead the philosophy Hannah Arendt to coin the term, the banality of evil. From Eichmanns point of view, he wasn't a mastermind behind one of humanitys greatest sins; he was merely doing his job as a small time member of a much larger machine. Evil, then, doesnt come in the form of Satan; it comes in the form of a bureaucrat doing what he has been told and not taking responsibility. Its just doing what the nice guy in the lab coat tells me to.

 Milgrams obedience experiment has imbedded itself into the popular consciousness because it purports to say something about human nature, and this is certainly true. But it also says something about how our environment molds our behavior and sense of ethics. The film emphasizes the importance of environmental factors by employing obviously projected backgrounds. Although the sciences purport to harden the world around us--to discover facts--the films playful form suggest that Milgrams work does the opposite. He becomes a postmodern scientist, suggesting with his work that we do not exist except as constructs of the world that shapes us. Theres no I there.

 Eventually, the film makes its way down the rabbit hole of inauthenticity. In 1976, CBS produced a fictionalized account of Milgrams obedience experiment, starring none other than William Shatner (Kellen Lutz) as a fictionalized version of Milgram. This leads to scene in which Milgram as played by Sarsgaard converses with Shatner as played by Kellen Lutz dressed as Milgram on the set of a cheesy 70s film.

The film even questions Milgrams ability to navigate ethical concerns in science. There is no way that the obedience experiment would make its way past an institutional review board today (informed consent is a hell of a thing), but Milgram seems disconcertedly dismissive of the kind of emotional harm he may have caused others. Tellingly, its the women in the film who mostly call him out on his lack of concern, which suggests that Milgram may have had a gendered ethical blind spot. In the end, the film asks us to think about ethics in a postmodern world. It reminds me of one of my favorite quotes by Vonnegut, which Ill leave you with: We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.",1458432000,,6303,4.93862134088763

7471031,4,B016F7J9SU,"Peter Sarsgaard (Black Mass and The Killing)stars as Professor Stanley Milgram who conducted a range of experiments as a social psychologist. His most famous/notorious were his obedience tests. He conducted these using volunteers who were told to electrocute a stranger if they answered any pre set question wrong in a controlled environment. The doses increased as the test progressed. His wife is played by the wonderful Winona Ryder.

His results caused him both fame and derision and he is still used and cited widely today. The film follows the life of Milgram, his family and marriage and some of his personal acquaintances. Sarsgaard, as ever, is excellent and convincing but there are some filmatic techniques that were a bit odd. There is deliberate use of fake backgrounds - as if it were a play  in some of the scenes. There is also the use of an Indian elephant for two corridor scenes which is left totally unreferenced!?

This could be the elephant in the room has already escaped and is amongst us? I do not know but it is a great centre piece to get you thinking. And that is what this film is really about  challenging and questioning our ideas and ideals about who we are and how we would act if confronted with the self same situations. He called it the agentic state whereby we say we were just following orders, or its the law or worse I was told to do it. I find this sort of discussion fascinating and there is much more here in this film about Milgrams work. One I really enjoyed and feel easy to recommend even with the elephant.",1456876800,,1554,4.59927797833935

I enjoy studying animal behavior, sensation and perception and I  was already familiar with Milgram's work but enjoyed this movie more than learning about him in Psychology class. Many scientists and psychologists tried to discredit his research but I tend to believe that perhaps the truth may have made them a bit uncomfortable when they realized their own vulnerability.  How many of us, especially 'objective' scientists, are willing to admit that we can easily become mindless puppets under the direction of PERCEIVED authority?
Humans haven't changed for the better either...I have noticed that more and more Americans tend to operate from a conditioned auto-pilot rather than employing critical thinking and moral integrity.
If you've ever wondered how a dictator like Hitler could influence so many humans to commit genocide without a morsel of doubt about what they are doing, watch this movie.  Thankfully, I was taught by my father to Always Question Authority ( even him!) and while it isn't always the most popular and well-liked point of view, it has saved me from becoming fodder for the status quo.",1456185600,,1283,5.124401913875598

One ""clincher"" was when roughly in the middle of the film, the experimented mentioned that not one person went beyond the barrier to see how the ""subject"" was doing, after allegedly receiving shocks, some rather severe with subjects exhibiting rather excruciating pain.  It was also somewhat entertaining (but admittedly sad also) to see how ""subjects"" would engage in conformist behavior, saying, for instance, that lines, that were obviously the same length,  were of different lengths, after giving into peer pressure.  Funny also to see how someone entering an elevator would face the back of the elevator, following the lead of the ""confederates"" of the experimenter.  Controversial?  Yes?  But it is good to know that this experiment is shown to generals, showing how much influence they can have on their troops.  I think, however, that the film could have been enhanced as I recall from my  undergraduate days, that people would stop giving shocks when someone would walk by nonchalantly (also in cahoots with the experimenter) and said ""Please, stop.""

7471058,3,B016F7J9SU,"Milgram's experiments, carried out in the early 1960s, hardly require explanation as they are well-known, having entered the popular culture through countless television shows, including a French game show and even a video game.  As the ""action,"" so to speak, consists of people sitting in front of a bank of switches, asking questions of a hidden subject, and responding to the subject's screams of pain by inflicting more pain on him, discounting repetition takes about ten minutes, the rest of the film is filled out with Milgram's backstory and numerous asides where Peter Sarsgaard breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience directly.  We also see how the outside world reacted to these experiments and their conclusions; the question of whether they were unethical in and of themselves is discussed and explored.

Anyone with even a slight sense of self-knowldege will have to ask themselves if they would have followed the instructions of the officious, commanding man in the white coat, or the pleas of the tormented subject, and if the film inspires any introspection in this area, it will certainly have fulfilled its function.  My issue with it is the basic command of filmmaking - ""show me, don't tell me,"" and there is, unfortunately, way too much telling here and not nearly enough showing - not surprising given the scarce opportunities for tension and resolution within the story.

7471070,2,B016F7J9SU,"This film is based on true events. Specifically, the scientific discoveries of Stanley Milgram.

Milgram, a social psychologist, became famous in the early 1960s because of his experiments on obedience. Subjects were asked to inflict painful -- and potentially life-threatening -- electric shocks upon another person. Milgram wanted to see how many people would injure -- and potentially kill -- other people, simply because an authority figure (the scientists conducting the experiment) asked them to.

No one was actually injured. The electric shocks were bogus. But the subjects didn't know that.

Milgram discovered that most people will blindly follow the orders of an authority figure, even to the point of possibly killing another person.

When he published his findings, controversy ensued because people thought his experiments were immoral. That Milgram was inflicting psychological harm upon his subjects (guilt, shame, etc.) by lying to them and pressuring them to injure other people. Milgram countered that his critics were more upset by his findings (that so many normal, decent Americans, would blindly obey sadistic orders, simply because they were orders).

Milgram was Jewish. (I say was, because he died in 1984.) He said the Nazis were the inspiration for his experiment. He wondered why so many otherwise normal, decent people, had followed the Nazis' orders. He wondered if it could happen here or anywhere else.

We know all this because Experimenter is an aggressively didactic film. Not so much a drama as a lecture. Not only does Milgram (played by Peter Sarsgaard) provide voiceovers throughout the film, but he's always turning to us, the viewing audience, to lecture us about his experiment, his observations on life, and his personal life in general. Milgram was a professor, and this film feels like an extended lecture, with some of the events dramatized for our education.

The science stuff is interesting -- which is why I'm giving this film 2 stars rather than 1. But there's something ... lacking. The film feels dry and hollow. I came away feeling like I hadn't learned much about Milgram at all.

Ironically, the film claims to have achieved the opposite goal. In the DVD's special features, Milgram's real-life brother says that the purpose of this film was to show Milgram's human side. That he was a real person, with a family and emotions and such. This film is supposed to depict Milgram's reaction -- that he was hurt or disappointed, I guess -- over the criticism he took for his experiments.

On that score, Experimenter fails.

Sarsgaard's delivery is mostly flat and monotonal. Which, I suppose, was Milgram's demeanor while conducting his experiments. Very scientific and authoritative. But Sarsgaard/Milgram carry that tone throughout the film. In the scenes where Milgram is criticized by the press, colleagues, and students, Milgram just stands there looking befuddled. Not warm or empathetic. More like a coldly logical Mr. Spock, perplexed by human reactions that he does not understand. Why do they not see the importance of my work? So illogical, these humans.

When Sarsgaard tries to sound enthusiastic or demoralized, his tone dips or rises ever so slightly. Not by much. More like a robot who's trying to pass for human, rather than an actual human.

On rare occasions, Migram's wife, Sasha (played by Winona Ryder), turns snippy or mildly upset. Ever so slightly snippy. But there's never any real bickering between them. They come across as a bland, middle class couple, with no real emotional turmoil in their lives. In one scene, in a diner, Milgram apologizes to his wife. We never learn why. It's implied that there's strain in their marriage, but we don't see it. The apology comes out of nowhere, for no reason. Milgram apologizes in a mild tone. Ryder mildly accepts it. They're a remarkably serene couple. One suspects they buy Quaalude by the boxcar.

The curious production design adds to the film's dry non-drama. This is a period piece. But rather than build period sets, with all the expense that entails, much of Experimenter simply uses black & white photographic backdrops. When Milgram and Sasha are in a car, the car is obviously indoors, in front of black & white photos of houses or streets. It's like watching a stage play rather than a film.

The DVD's special features include an interview with the production designer, who offers some&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/aesthetic/dp/0786449721/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">aesthetic</a>&nbsp;excuse for doing it this way. My own reaction -- the backdrops feel stifling, adding to the film's dry lecture tone. Adding to the film's ponderous dullness.

Aesthetics aside, I wonder if all these backdrops weren't just a way to save money. Recreating the 1960s - 1970s would have cost more. Cheaper to use backdrops.

And what's with the ELEPHANT? Several times, Milgram exits his lab and walks down a university hall -- and then an elephant appears behind him. Following him. I don't know if it was a real elephant on set, or a green screen, or digitally added into scene. I only want to know -- WHAT was the point of the elephant? Symbolic of something, I suppose. But elephants are famous for their memory rather than obedience, or lack thereof.

Really, WHY are elephants following Milgram in a university hallway?

Winona Ryder has a small, thankless role as ""the wife."" She doesn't say or do much. Mainly she's there to admire Milgram. To show us that Milgram had a loving and supportive wife. (He did -- the real Sasha appears at film's end to say a few words about her late husband's important work.)

Ryder's appearance in this small role underscore the complaints of many older actresses -- the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/dearth-of-significant-roles-for-actresses-once-they-turn-40/dp/1452892601/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">dearth of significant roles for actresses once they turn 40</a>.

Not that ""the wife"" has to be a small role. Ryder's role as ""the wife"" in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lois-Wilson-Story/dp/B003YKYX9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lois Wilson Story</a>&nbsp;was the lead role.

But on the whole, it's sad to see significant roles dry up -- or know that they're soon to dry up -- for so many  of Hollywood's most creative women.

Almereyda, long one of our bravest and least conventional film-makers, uses his tendencies to break from traditional storytelling to his advantage here.  He breaks our usual illusion of reality in a movie with black and white projections as parts of sets, the main character addressing the camera, sometimes about events that haven't happened yet, and even a (very funny) literal elephant in the room.  These playful, Brechtian devices distance us and keep us from emotionally getting lost in the story in the way a traditional Hollywood bio-pic would have us do.  But it serves to heighten key intellectual questions about Milgram and his work  which also manipulated reality, and implied a certain artificial distancing between Milgram and the human race.

Like a film, Milgram's experiment manipulated people, told them stories, to get them to react a certain way, and Almereyda makes us ponder a lot of these uneasy connections between art and science.

Not all of these cinematic gambits work, and sometimes ideas get repeated beyond effectiveness.  But Ill take this kind of fresh, jarring approach to looking at a man and the ideas his work over a traditional, shallower Hollywood approach any day.",1450483200,12,1595,5.178988326848249

7471109,5,B016F7J9SU,"The author, made one mistake: The average German was  not a Jew hater or tormentor. The government officials and soldiers followed orders because unlike the ""experiment"", such officials and military people would be severely punished if they disobeyed.

The average German really did not hate Jews. They almost had to be pushed to go along with the anti-Semitic agenda. Some Poles and Ukranians were different. They were more than willing to be violent against innocent Jews. Therefore, the experiment did not prove anything about the German people's willingness to be evil..

The one pogrom, Kristalnacht, was staged by Goebbels. It was not a spontaneous uprising by the ordinary citizens. Germans are no more and no less anti-Semitic than anyone else. It would be racist to believe otherwise.

BTW, that no more and no less level is actually relatively high, meaning there is a high level of anti-Semitism in the world, including Germany. Probably at least 20%.",1446076800,,962,5.147435897435898

7471111,4,B016F7J9SU,"Good acting, especially by Sarsgaard as a man haunted by his one good idea. Amusing cameos. Well written and surprisingly funny. Some quirky directorial ideas, as one would expect from Almereyda. Not your boilerplate biopic. And a good cinematic representation of intellectuals and their discontents. It suddenly occurs to me that this is the sort of movie Woody Allen aspires to make but fails for lack of intellectual and literary chops.",1445990400,,439,5.197183098591549

7471114,2,B016F7J9SU,Cheaply made. Good lead performance but over acted in general. Has the look and feel of an off Broadway play. What's with the ridiculous facial hair President Lincoln! Some sound editing would have helped. Violens often overwhelm dialogue. Another eating ice cream with my child scene. I don't think the Professor is being ironic when he's discussing his story becoming a bad movie.,1445731200,3,382,5.079365079365079
7471115,4,B016F7J9SU,"This is not a high octane adrenaline Vin Diesel Fast and Furious movie.  It is very academic And thought provoking.  Anyone in Psychology or Medical Research or Sociology or Philosophy will find this a Great movie.  How could anyone with a conscience blindly obey the Nazis or ISIS or any organization, without question? Is it just basic instinct to obey authority, without thinking and acting independently. It shows graphically the dark side of human nature that lurks within us. Nietzsche and Carl Jung both railed against the arsenical malignancy of the herd mentality. Dr Stanley Milgrams 1961 OBEDIENCE study graphically shows how the majority of intelligent successful men and women, from all races and religion are reduced to obsequious survile wrecks.  This movie is a bit slow and the screen play is not the best.  The acting is very good.  Despite its shortcomings, the movie is a compelling shocking exposure of human nature",1445731200,,936,5.084967320261438

7471118,4,B016F7J9SU,"This is a very interesting and unusually filmed bio-pic of the researcher who documented people's willingness to bend to authority. He went on to do other things after the famous Milgram experiment, but his life was defined by that groundbreaking and very controversial work. Many thought that he acted unethically in the study because of the deception that the study required. Such a study would likely never pass modern IRB review today because of the lack of informed consent.",1445558400,2,479,5.075949367088608

Nothing's happening besides the experiment. If it was a BBC documentary I would give it 4 stars, but it's not. If you haven't heard about the experiment AND you can watch this movie for free AND you have nothing else to do - that might be a good idea.

8736413,1,B016F7J9SU,"Bad hair, over acting, flat acting, Milgram stepping out to address the audience, sometimes in the middle of an intense discussion, meaningless experiments -- go sing in the subway with a partner to observe -- boring, frankly.

And what was that elephant doing in the picture?

A much better video was made by Milgram himself.  It appears here on Amazon at almost $200.

But you can see it free by Googling: video Stanley Milgram Films on Social Psychology: Obedience

An immensely important study that deserves a much better movie.

8736418,5,B016F7J9SU,This feature is about a  psychologist scientist who practices study's on the general public to gain  knowledge and understanding to better understand human beings. This movies shocked and amazed me. I have to admit it's kinda mono tone. But is perfectly written and and very believable.  It is based on a true story which makes it more enjoyable to watch. And who doesn't love the previous Caspar girl as the co host of the film. You should watch this if you enjoy thinking and gaining knowledge. If your looking for a shooter or massive drama this isn't for you. I love this film I give it a 9 outta 10!,1494979200,,604,4.472727272727273

8736421,1,B016F7J9SU,"This film has an interesting way of telling a story I'll give it that.  Basically we've got an embellished fictional version of the late Stanley Milgram, talking to the audience in a memory flashback from the grave, where we watch his memories from when he met his wife in an elevator going to a party, to his most famous experiment, seeing if strangers would keep increasing electric shocks to a fellow test subject when he was screaming in pain for them to stop, because they were being instructed to.  The Stanford Prison Experiment movie did a similar thing, but that was actually entertaining, the Experimenter is pretty boring, and any small amount of interest is gone once the main experiment is over and we move onto pretty boring stuff like dropping mail to be posted addressed to different groups and seeing how many actually were, giving a letter for a stranger to someone who doesn't know them but they can only give it to someone they know who they think will most likely know them and seeing how many hands it takes to get there, taking peoples photographs and well I can't even remember the rest, the film was so boring.",1488931200,,1135,4.641791044776119
