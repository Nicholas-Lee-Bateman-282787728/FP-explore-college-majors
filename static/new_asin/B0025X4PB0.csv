8351322,5,B0025X4PB0,I watch this before I go to sleep and I don't have the nightmares I would from watching any of the CSI series. Not as bloody and gory and I really enjoy watching them and look forward to the next case.,1282348800,,201,3.926829268292683
8351323,3,B0025X4PB0,"It is funny how one's memory plays tricks on them and remember something as being so good, then you go back years later and you are disappointed; Matlock was like that for me. I will say that this was a gift and the receiver loved it, the problem is that I had to sit there for hours and be lobotomized by poor acting, badly crafted story and corny humor. The best thing I can say is that she is also a fan of Mama's Family and when compared to Matlock, I am a Matlock fan.",1272067200,,473,3.9894736842105263
8351324,5,B0025X4PB0,I always liked the show Matlock and now that it is no longer on TV I can still enjoy the show on these DVD's. I will probably get more seasons to go with the ones that I already have. I would reccomend this for any Matlock fan. Thanks,1262044800,2,234,3.8958333333333335

It is just difficult to get the hang of how to arrive at a certain spot-the spot where I left off, if I have to stop and come back at a later time.  But I am getting better at it.  I have always loved Matlock and I want to purchase more seasons, especially the ones with Clarence Gilyard, Jr. as Conrad.  Matlock is a very friendly and 'real' person; he loves hot dogs, shines his own shoes, and plays the banjo.  He appreciates the value of a dollar since he came from a poor family, and worked his way through law school. He works hard for a living, and yet will take cases for gratis sometimes. He is a Famous Lawyer who honors Truth and Justice, and tries hard to find who really 'did it', or at least enough evidence to show there is a reasonable doubt that his client performed the crime.  It is great to see the interaction between him and his investigator, Tyler Hudson and his daughter, Charlene.  He loves his daughter, and is a concerned Papa.  What is special about this series is the father/neighbor/ friend roles we see of Benjamin Matlock woven throughout the shows.  It is lacking in Cannon, Perry Mason, and others. (By the way, Murder She Wrote, is also a great mystery series.) May you enjoy your DVD's as much as I do!",1254614400,4,1412,4.290566037735849
