1798374,2,B0000714FA,"This is definitely not ""Doctor Who"" at its peak.  This show could do both serious sci-fi drama or undemanding kids entertainment,  but I don't think it managed to get either one right here.  Even the high-camp Pertwee era, which was aimed straight at the kids, was usually much better than this.  It is entertaining in its way, but despite being full of action and event, I thought it really went nowhere and didn't take an interesting route getting there.
I could really pick it apart, but I won't bother.  If you're a Doctor Who fan,  you're probably familiar with it enough to know whether you want to buy it.  But if you're not,  I'd definitely reccomend you pick up something else first.  ""Doctor Who"" was an amazing TV show,  but precious little in this story will give you any idea why.  Save this one for later.",1042848000,2,819,4.541095890410959
1798375,4,B0000714FA,"Well, it's not the best of the Pertwee era, but it's not the worst, and it's certainly good fun.  And Roger Delgado is true to form as the best Master of all Time and Space.  Pertwee and Katy Manning have great chemistry as always.  Look out for Dave Prowse (aka Darth Vadar's body) - he's the one with the bull's head that charges Jon Pertwee and his cape.  The TARDIS console room gets a face lift, complete with Tupperware bowls in the walls.  The Chronivore (antagonist #2 - his whites are VERY white!) is laughable, as he swings through the studio on invisible wires... BUT - if you're watching Doctor Who to see great special effects, you're missing the point!  Grab some friends, some snack food and some drinks, and treat yourself to some truly groovy, 1970s fantasy.",1037750400,26,775,4.579710144927536

1798417,5,B0000714FA,the story wasn't the best and the special effects aren't good but then again its the 70's when this was made so they did not have the technology like they do now . it was well written but some episodes where a bit boring. hopefully they re-release it because  99.99 on up  72.70 on up is a bit much.  The Late Jon Pertwee and The late Roger Delgado  where great in it they work so well off one another and long with Katy Manning,1391299200,,428,4.059523809523809
1798418,5,B0000714FA,I love Pertwee and the way he connects with the Master and think that Delgado was a great Master character.,1382054400,,107,4.4
1798419,3,B0000714FA,The movie needs more work as a Doctor Who story with its weak plot and confussing theme but the Master and Doctor is great.,1372032000,,123,4.166666666666667
1798420,5,B0000714FA,Love viewing this DVD and have now got more Dr Who's thanks very much and keep getting more of these stories fun and happy,1363392000,,122,4.125
1798421,5,B0000714FA,"Sorry for the title of my review. It's just that Roger Delgado, Katy Manning and Ingrid Pitt's performances stood out the most in my mind. The special effects are indeed ""special"" but it's the 1970's so we as a audience from this era can't complain. The features were up to par with making you experience the whole thing over again, like you are seeing it for the very first time. Frankly, in my honest opinion- my favourite scene was when Galliea and the Master were flirting and Jo and Lakis were watching. It's just the epitome of cute.",1358985600,,539,4.510204081632653
1798422,4,B0000714FA,I've been watching doctor who since the late 80's. I start buying the older ones to complete my collection. I like Tom Baker as well.,1356912000,,133,4.36
1798423,5,B0000714FA,I liked this story. Just like the other if you like Doctor Who you will like this one. The special effects are cheesy but a good story.,1356393600,,135,4.037037037037037
1798424,4,B0000714FA,"if you like doctor who, get this one its a great episode but then i am biased i like them all.i have not had a problem with any of the dvds i've ordered.",1355097600,,153,3.6666666666666665
1798445,4,B0000714FA,In this story I feel Jon shows why his Doctor is so well liked. It is his acting with Roger Delgado that keeps it moving and fun to watch. It is a great treat to see the late Ingrid Pitt looking beautiful and doing a decent job in the acting area. All of the cast does well and it is still Pertwee and Delgado that steal the show. Ending leaves you a little empty but all in all a great show. Fun for all!!!,1305676800,,407,3.857142857142857
1798446,5,B0000714FA,"This is one of those stories that gets knocked in fandom as not being very good but I must disagree with that view. The story is tight and hangs together pretty well for being a six parter. The acting is very good from both the regulars and guest cast. The picture quality is from restored NTSC tapes and, while some problems remain, the picture quality is much better than the old VHS version I had from a PBS broadcast I taped in the early '80's. As usual with Doctor Who dvd's, this one is packed with special features.",1278806400,4,522,4.336734693877551
1798447,2,B0000714FA,"The Master is attempting to summon up Kronos, the Eater of Time, in order to gain the ultimate power. But in order to do this the Master will have to travel back in time to Atlantis. Now the Doctor and Jo must follow him in order to stop him from unleashing the greatest threat to all of time itself. A great plot, but it's ruined by not having enough action in it, a script that seems to drag on forever, and some corny parts added into it. It's worth watching, but not worth wasting your money on. Not recommended!",1275523200,,516,4.222222222222222
1798448,5,B0000714FA,I remember seeing this one on PBS when I was growing up.  This is a great episode and John Pertwee is one of the best doctors to date!,1272931200,,134,3.7857142857142856
1798449,5,B0000714FA,This is a great old Doctor Who episode that isn't available on DVD at the time of this post.  This is a must see episode to understand this doctor.,1229990400,2,147,4.068965517241379
1798450,3,B0000714FA,"This episode would be great if it was made today, but it was just a story before its time.  The very premise of the story was interesting, but then you were shocked back to reality when the fearsome Kronos was portrayed as a man covered in a sheet flying around.  Or how about the Minotaur, which was also suppose to be a fearsome creature?  Yet the way the production team portrayed the Minotaur was rather silly.  You could have ran circles it.  Granted Doctor Who is know for its cheesy special effects, but in this episode, for whatever reason ruined the atmosphere in my opinion.

What also lead to the downfall of this episode was the storyline.  Approaching the 4-6 part of the story, the story became somewhat confusing, as if certain parts were just time fillers & really served no purpose.

However, one thing I really liked about this story was the acting.  The Master was at his peak performance, & appeared to be the legendary foe he was supposed to be.  The other characters also did a pretty good job in this episode filling their roles.

Overall, this episode is worth watching.  Perhaps the special effects won't ruin the story for you, as they did for me.  But in reality, it neither really bad or neither really great.  If anything, its worth seeing the Master in one of this peak performances.",1210809600,2,1313,4.579399141630901
1798451,2,B0000714FA,"Before ""Battlefield"", there was The time Monster. A mix of sci-fi and Atlantean mythlogy. The Time Monster strarts out decent enough, with the return of the Master working on TOMTIT, sort of a temporal matter transmission machine, while the Doctor hunts him down with clues he had in a dream. there are some interesting ideas, and our friends from UNIT have some humor included. But, like all Pertwe six-parters, The Time Monsters comes to a complete and sudden stop when they reach the mythological Atlantis. A few good lines can't help the last 2 episodes. The scenes betwen the Doctor's and the Master's TARDIS are amusing, but this can hardly salvage one of the worst of Season 9.",1053388800,3,684,4.805084745762712
1798452,5,B0000714FA,"I really love Pertwee's Doctor.  I like most of the Doctors, but I really love his and this is one of his best.  Well thought out and not overly cheezy.",1046908800,2,152,4.033333333333333
1798453,5,B0000714FA,"While VHS is a dying format, those of us who have devoted most of our lives to collecting Doctor Who videos can't resist buying them.
Since Dr. Who is no longer on TV in many places these days, it's been a long time since I have seen many of them, and ""The Time Monster"" did not disapoint.
Unlike most 6-part Dr. Who adventures that start of strong through the first 3 episodes but end up dragging the story out; ""The Time Monster"" maintains a steady pace throught.
There's some neat slow motion camera work throughout the story, and very few ""wobbly sets"" and other special effects gaffs that are not usually appreciated by the non-whovian.
Best viewed on a rainy day with a nice hot cup of Earl Grey.",1043625600,19,702,4.449612403100775
1798454,4,B0000714FA,"The Doctor has a nightmare, more a premonition, of the Master being in control using a trident-shaped crystal, and it turns out he is right.  His nemesis, using the alias Professor Thascales, has invented a time-device called TOMTIT (Transmission Of Matter Through Interstitial Time) at Wooton, just out of Cambridge.  It basically dematerializes an object, sends it through ""the crack between now and now"" and rematerializes it at its destination.  And yes, it does use a trident-shaped crystal.  He has Dr. Ruth Ingram and her brother Stuart as his assistants.
The Brigadier is sent as a UNIT observer, but during a trial run, Stuart is aged to an octagenarian.  The Master then calls for Kronos, who is a chronovore, dangerous creatures living in the time vortex that cab ""swallow a life as quickly as a boa constrictor can swallow a rabbit.  Fur and all!""
The Doctor and Jo arrive at Wooton because they detect the Master's TARDIS and comes upon an aged Stuart, who mentions the name Kronos.  From then, it's the Doctor and Jo against the Master and Krasis, the high priest of Atlantis who unwittingly helps the Master in controlling the dangerous chronovore.
One interesting goof is the word ""chronovore.""  ""Chrono"" is Greek, while ""vore"" is Latin.  Surely ""chronophage"" should have been more appropriate, or ""temporavore""?  Another is the V-1 rocket that the Master brings through time against Yates' convoy.  A farmer remembers a V-1 striking in the exact area in 1944.  Unless there was more than one V-1 attack in that area, it's impossible for the farmer remembering it if it had been taken out of time.  And Aidan Murphy (Hippias) has a shrill and irritating voice.
Other items:  the Doctor and the Master's TARDIS materializing within each other is later duplicated in Logopolis.  And the rounded wall designs in the Doctor's TARDIS is a neat improvement from the usual.  In fact I wish it'd stayed that way.  Jo is at her most loyal and bubbliest, and not only has a chance to wear her usual mini and long boots but a nice Atlantean dress (and surely a wig).  And one must suspend some sort of disbelief over the time flow analogue constructed by the Doctor, created out of a wine bottle, two forks, two corks, keychains, and some piece of equipment.  At least the Doctor's having fun.
George Cormack (Dalios) would later appear in Jon Pertwee's final story Planet Of The Spiders as the old mountaintop hermit referred to in Episode 6.  Dave Prowse (the Guardian) is best known as the body of Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy.  The big guest star here only appears in the last two episodes, and that's Hammer horror queen Ingrid Pitt (Galleia), whose deep sultry voice is used to great effect.
The Time Monster has the reputation of being one of the stinkers of the Jon Pertwee era, but that is hardly the case.  It is an engaging 6-parter, one of the best UNIT stories, and features one of the Master's boldest schemes.",1043452800,11,2946,4.780632411067193
7973585,2,B0000714FA,"The Time Monster suffers from a series of utterly bizarre creative decisions. The realization of Kronos makes it one of the most hilarious looking Doctor Who monsters of all time. The plot takes so many random turns such as the Doctor slinging together a time device from stuff around the house that temporarily thwarts the Master's plan and the Master taking an Atlantean priest to be a sidekick, and there's the idea that this whole adventure started because the Doctor had a trippy dream sequence.

At the same time, the story isn't without redemption. It includes both the Brigadier and the Master, and while this doesn't represent the best characterization for either, it's fun to see them in the story. The Time Monster's take on Atlantis isn't great, but it's better than the Underwater Menace's. Still, overall this story will probably most enjoyable in a ""so bad it's good way"" rather than for providing much quality. It's easily one of the weakest stories of the Pertwee era.",1503532800,,985,4.8982035928143715
7973586,4,B0000714FA,"would have gave it three and half if it let me, was a decent story the actual monster was I would guess a result of a small budget, but it was still a good story classic Doctor vs Master",1472428800,,186,3.7948717948717947
7973587,4,B0000714FA,"The Master has a new plan to take control of time itself. he assumes the roll of a university professor in order have equipment for this plan. while the Doctor and Jo are on the hunt for the Master's TARDIS. they find at Cambridge with a trident-shaped crystal belonging to ancient Atlantis. the Master's plan is revealed and it's a dozy, his plans to release Cronus. it is also revealed that Cronus is a being called a time eater, not a titan. the Master learns From an Atlantain priest that the crystal he as is apart of another crystal, witch means a trip to Atlantis. and it turns of that the master is the reason the city is destroyed and a natural disaster. but once AGAIN the Master's plan fails and the Doctor stops him.
i do agree with the comments made by Barry Letts, the Cronus costume is odd looking",1449273600,,812,4.3841059602649
7973588,5,B0000714FA,"Not the best story involving the Master but if you've ever wondered what would happen if a T.A.R.D.I.S. CRASHED into another? Or where did show runner,Russell T.
