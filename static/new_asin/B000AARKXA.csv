2383913,1,B000AARKXA,"......and that is not a compliment for Jersey Girl! I am a Kevin Smith lapdog and borderline Degrassi obsessive. However, I found the Jay and Silent Bob/Degrassi arc difficult to watch. Kevin Smith's portrayal of Kevin Smith was creepy and made me queasy. In acting, the more silent Kevin Smith is, the better.",1138838400,6,310,4.867924528301887
2383914,4,B000AARKXA,"I'll be the first to admit, I saw ""Jay and Silent Bob"" and bought the disc, however I didn't really know much about Degrassi the next generation. But it's OK, because the disc is pretty self explanitory when it comes to stories from other episodes that were carried over. One thing You'll have to keep in mind is that this was just a guest spot by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith on 3 episodes, the episodes were about Kevin Smith wanting to shoot his new Jay and Silent bob movie there(in Canada). One thing i didn't like was how Kevin kept throwing in anti Bush jabs into the show. I'm not a Bush supporter, but Bush bashing really had no place in this show.

As for the show(s), they were very entertaining. I could definetly see getting into this show on a regular basis, even if it was a little Cheezey.",1137974400,20,804,4.324503311258278
2383915,5,B000AARKXA,"I have been a fan of ""Degrassi: The Next Generation"" since it premiered on The-N a few years ago...While I knew who Kevin Smith was, I was not familiar with his work. The three episodes Smith appears on during the fourth season of ""Degrassi: TNG"" were excellent, and I was excited to see what this DVD set contained...the thought of an unrated version was also interesting as although ""Degrassi: TNG"" pushes the boundaries for a show aimed at teens, I was unsure how ""unrated"" it could be.

The disc contains the three final episodes of the show's fourth season, and some generic bonus features including cast and character bios, trailers, and a small featurette on the filming of one of the show's scenes.

The REST of the disc is where the UNRATED really comes in.....this disc is excellent, but I can DEFINITELY see where the parents of younger audience members would be angry with the content. The commentary for instance, features Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes, along with the actress portraying Caitlin Ryan on the show, and one of ""Degrassi""'s talented writers. Portions of the commentary (excellent by the way...and included on all three episodes) are quite crude, and PROBABLY is not appropriate for audience members younger than 15 or 16. Another innapropriate portion is a featurette with Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes talking about ""Degrassi"", ""Clerks"", and some of their other works. The two men go off on tangents about topics of sexual nature. Portions of this featurette are comical, but is definitely not geared toward young Noggin viewers just crossing over to The-N.

My favorite portion of the DVD is an almost 30-minute interview with Kevin Smith. During the interview, Kevin Smith talks about all things ""Degrassi"", from the original show, to how he became involved with the new generation. There is quite a good bit of trivia concerning The-N, CTV, 90210, and other topics in this interview. As I have seen every episode of the new generation, this was an excellent interview as Kevin Smith really appreciates this show---you can tell as he is very sincere about his love for all things ""Degrassi""!

All in all, an excellent DVD---as I mentioned, there is a very good deal of language and questionable topics throughout the special features that parents of younger fans should know about. However, this is a MUST for any of those ""Degrassi"" fans in high school, college, or older (you know you are out there!)",1135641600,18,2428,4.914634146341464
2383916,5,B000AARKXA,"I haven't seen the DVD itself but I've seen these three shows and I enjoyed them immensely -- but let me put that in context.  My 12-year-old daughter adores Degrassi and we watch the show together on Friday nights.  As far as kids' programming goes, I am grateful for Degrassi because the show tackles issues like menstruation and date rape in straightforward, non-patronizing ways that young adolescents can relate to.  I'd so much rather have her watching this show about teenagers struggling with their decision to have sex (as uncomfortable as that can be to watch sometimes) than many of the network situation comedies which feature young adults making jokes about sex just for giggle value.  But, let's face it, Degrassi is not high art nor is it the hippest show on tv.  That's why I was delighted when Kevin Smith showed up on three episodes.  Those episodes were hilarious!  And there were wonderfully humorous riffs on American stereotypes about Canada, such as Alanis Morissette saying ""eh"" every other word in her part in the film.

So Kevin Smith fans may be disappointed and Degrassi fans may or may not be thrilled but the parents of Degrassi fans may really like this.  Kids, buy it for your folks!",1133740800,5,1215,4.802884615384615
2383917,1,B000AARKXA,"Being a big Degrassi and Jay/Silent Bob fan, I was looking forward to this! But I was severely let down! It is bad! It's not the Jay & Silent Bob that we love! I am warning you now - don't buy it for full price! I've already sold my copy on ebay to some poor unsuspecting sod who (like me) probably has high expectations.",1133049600,7,321,4.03125
2383918,3,B000AARKXA,"Boo.  This would have been better if they actually made and released the MOVIE Kevin Smith was supposedly doing w/the Degrassi kids in Canada.  This is just the last 3 episodes of the season.  I mean, Degrassi is still great, and these episodes are good, but they should have made the actual MOVIE and put in on the DVD too.  I'm only giving it 3 stars b/c I love Degrassi... otherwise, this is a pointless DVD seeing as how the episodes re-run on the N about every 5 minutes.  So I say boo.",1132272000,3,491,4.236559139784946
2383919,3,B000AARKXA,"This is deffinately a Degrassi DVD more than a Jay and Silent Bob DVD. I don't really understand why it is ""Uncut"" because it is really tame.

I have never watched Degrassi before but Was a big fan of Degrassi Jr. High as a kid so it was cool to see that some of the old kids are in the show and all grown up.

Although this is really a soap opera for a teen/preteen audiance,

it was watchable and I am giving it an extra star for nostalgia.",1131926400,5,442,3.943820224719101
2383920,1,B000AARKXA,"Sorry Kevin Smith but stick to your proven formula, this one really sucked. Very disappointed. I have NO idea what you were thinking? Missing high school are we? Its kind of like Dawsons Creek with Jay n Silent bob in it for those of you in the US. What a wierd premise and it does not work.",1131926400,14,291,4.12280701754386
2383931,4,B000AARKXA,"I was disapointed that it wasn't the actual Jay and Silent Bob go Candian Aye, but it is the 3 degrassi episodes all together of the making of it. I would recomend this dvd to any fan of Degrassi!",1301356800,,196,4.051282051282051
2383932,1,B000AARKXA,I wish I could erase bits of this from my brain. It just ruined things for me. It was not at all as funny as the other stuff. Money would be better spent on an evening with Kevin Smith.,1287014400,2,185,3.769230769230769
2383933,4,B000AARKXA,Would have been a lot better if there was more Jay and Silent Bob.  The title is a little miss leading.  There is no jay and Silent Bob in this movie.,1265500800,,150,3.806451612903226
2383934,2,B000AARKXA,"It's this simple.  If you've never seen an episode of Degrassi, even by accident, you will be very disappointed with this DVD.  The Jay & Silent Bob sections are really funny.  They fight Canadian ninjas.  Nice.  But the 1:14 run time could have, should have, had the Degrassi parts edited out as a bonus feature.  It's like reading three chapters out of a book.  There may be some interesting parts in what you read, but you're just not going to understand the story.  Not worth the time invested.  And the explicit language is only in the extras section.  Shame on you Kevin Smith.  Shame on you.",1218931200,6,598,4.547169811320755
2383935,1,B000AARKXA,Jay and Silent Bob do degrassi was the worst DVD i have ever watched don't buy it was boring and stupid,1217203200,3,103,3.9523809523809526
2383936,3,B000AARKXA,"Don't be fooled into thinking that this is the next Jay & Silent Bob movie.  This is actually just a couple of episodes of Degrassi: The Next Generation featuring Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes.  Fortunately, I like Degrassi and as a TV series it's not that bad, it's more young teen situations and less off the wall adult humor that I was expecting.",1204070400,9,347,4.492063492063492

I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this DVD. I saw Jay and Silent Bob and expected something more like Clerks. I was willing to give it a chance however. Unfortunately, 20 minutes in was more than enough for me. The ""after school special"" quality of the show was way to much to endure while waiting for an occasional spot from Kevin Smith or Jason Mewes. Being a fan, it's hard to give this a bad review, but I guess you can't make everyone happy all the time.",1200787200,6,709,5.883495145631068
2383938,3,B000AARKXA,"I remember a reference to Degrassi from something else involving Kevin Smith so when I saw this I thought it would be really cool. I had a hard time trying to figure out what exactly was going on. It was like The OC meats Saved by the Bell (The New Class) meets Jay and Silent Bob. There was so much teenage drama I felt it was just exaggerated. Keven Smith is only in the first episode for  about 5 min. The other two episodes have Jason acting like Jay hitting on HS girls, although I have heard Jason/Jay are totally different personalities.

I never really got into the Degrassi series although I tried to enjoy the regular tv show. I think I am just too old to appreciate it now, although I still like the Saved by the Bell series that I grew up watching.

If it was Jay and Silent Bob do Bayside High  this movie would have been 5 stars for sure... cause the Degrassi crew is a bunch of clown shoes.",1197676800,3,905,4.183908045977011
2383939,3,B000AARKXA,"This is a three-episode arc of a serial television melodrama/teen soap.  As such, it wasn't going to be ""tidy"" as a video release.  Those looking for Kevin Smith/Jay & Silent Bob won't be disappointed--but he's definitely created a character for himself here.  Smith's relationship with one of the Degrassi mothers (ignoring the fact that he is in fact married in real life, and is playing himself) overwhelms most of his camera time, and as a non-regular watcher of the show, I have to wonder how badly this little subplot derailed an ongoing story where that woman seemed to be happily engaged going into these episodes.

All in all, it's a fun diversion, a great chance to see Smith make fun of himself and have fun with these characters at a time when ""Clerks II"" wasn't yet a glint in the eye of the moviegoing public and there was no clear sense of whether or not Jay and Bob would ever be back.",1196553600,,901,4.54320987654321
2383940,3,B000AARKXA,"Because there were too many positive reviews and a few negative reviews I decided to write this one.  I am one of Kevin Smith's biggest fans and own alot of his stuff (DVD's, Comic Books, Action Figures, etc.); however, I decided against owning this DVD set.  It is not because the set is not good, it is because it is something I would probably never watch again.  The entire DVD consists of 3 or 4 episodes of Degrassi High (A canadian ripoff of 'Saved By The Bell').  In this feature Kevin Smith plays himself.  Smith is asked by one of Degrassi's main characters to come to Degrassi High and shoot a movie.  In rolls, Jay and Silent Bob (TA-DA!), then the plot becomes boring.  Jason Mewes has basically a cameo in this entire production, and Smith's performances are extremely weak (Shocking, I know).  For the rest of the episodes, we concentrate mostly on the kids of Degrassi High with Smith only make brief appearances.

Unless you are a fan of Degrassi High, or want to see what Kevin Smith might have looked like in an episode of Saved By The Bell, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!

Just as a comparision Kevin had a much better performance in 'Bottoms Up' (with Paris Hilton and Jason Mewes) and an Oscar winning performance in 'Catch and Release' (with Jennifer Garner) when compared to this garbage.  He was even better in 'Vulgar' (which I thought completely sucked) than his performance in this video.",1196467200,2,1403,4.616935483870968
2383941,5,B000AARKXA,I have to say I was already a big fan of the original Degrassi and really had little to know ideal about the Neaxt generation. I feel this was a great way to introduce me the new generation. Jay an Bob decide to film one of their movies at Degrassi well you can figure out the rest. IT a silly film that brings some new and old members togethor. I liked this film because Kevin Smith like me is a big fan of the show and it help me introduce the new cast to someone who had no ideal what was going on. Its typical Degrassi but with a Kevin Smith Twist. Its a must for any Degrassi fan. Im glad I did now I have to catch up on the Next Generation. So should you.,1192406400,,661,3.8676470588235294
2383942,4,B000AARKXA,"This is great for me because I am a big Degrassi and Kevin Smith fan. But, if you are looking at this because you loved Clerks, skip it. It's not really representative of Smith's other work. If you can pick up cheap (like I did) it still might be worth taking a look at.",1187827200,2,270,4.018518518518518
2383943,4,B000AARKXA,More Degrassi-ish than Jay & Silent Bob-ish. Jason Mews and Kevin Smith guest stared on three episodes of Degrassi. This is them.,1185667200,4,129,4.909090909090909
2383944,1,B000AARKXA,I have loved everything Kevin Smith had something to do with until this.  It reminded me of a bad Gibson Girls episode (not like they are ever good either).  Don't expect this to be anything like a normal Kevin Smith adventure.,1173312000,6,227,4.512195121951219
2383945,1,B000AARKXA,"this movie is just the last 3 episodes of one of the seasons of degrassi, the ones with kevin smith in them. nothing really exciting about it at all. you can make your own movie by watching the 3 episodes right in order.",1172102400,8,220,4.1395348837209305
2383946,5,B000AARKXA,I admit that I would love Jay and Silent Bob doing anything. I am somewhat less of a Degrassi enthusiast. But I found this to be enjoyable and necessary to keep my Kevin Smith collection complete.,1162425600,11,196,4.472222222222222
2383947,2,B000AARKXA,"I received this DVD from my brother who is possibly a bigger Kevin Smith fan than I am. I thought the fact that he was  giving away his copy was pretty odd at the time until I watched the DVD myself.

The Degrassi episodes are amazingly boring and Jay and Silent Bob's toned-down appearances don't help much. I really liked the original Degrassi series so I was disappointed by this DVD.

There are some funny moments in the ""Extras"" section of the DVD but I would still only recommend this as a ""rent"" or something to buy used if you are a diehard fan.",1146268800,12,553,4.298076923076923
2383948,4,B000AARKXA,I liked these episodes of degrassi. i wish this had been made into an actual movie. It was good,1142467200,,95,4.052631578947368
2383949,5,B000AARKXA,"Ok hey I have gotta admit I bought this movie thinking WOW cool another Jay & Silent Bob flick. But I didn't do  my home work this should be called: ""Jay & Silent Bob Do Clean Humor"".That's Right no cussing no Dope not Even a Quick Stop just some TV series about some teens in Canada and Kevin Smith Decides to shoot the next Jay & Silent Bob At their school.  It was good for what it was but if your looking for the usual brand of crude humor stear clear. While I my self try to collect all of The Jay & Silent Bob Movies or Kevin Smith flicks. I Kinda wish I had waited for this one unless you can get it for a bargen don't bother.",1140825600,11,633,3.89922480620155
2383950,5,B000AARKXA,"Seen the complaints from people about the dvd being unrated and such. I think the point was missed. The three episodes of Degrassi kind of dragged me in (I used to watch Degrassi Junior High religiously as a teenager), but felt kind of cheated. I thought there had to be more, so I hit up the extras. And have never laughed so hard in my life.

The extended Intro rant of ad libbed Jason and Kevin was hysterical, the commentaries on the episodes was brilliant, and some of the deleted scenes and bloopers were just unbelievable. I picked this up on a whim, and will be going in more details through the commentaries and stuff, but if you're a Kevin Smith fan or a Degrassi Alum parent, this is a worthwhile buy.",1139702400,7,712,4.393939393939394
8077336,5,B000AARKXA,"I think its so funny that people are complaining about this not being a Kevin Smith film. It is his guest appearance on Degrassi the next generation (3 full episodes) plus behind the scenes and interviews. I watched it when it was on tv and I was happy to relive the silly memories of Kevin Smith getting to be on one of the shows he watched when he was a kid. I am glad to have this on dvd as part of my collection. Kevin Smith did not direct anything, only acted on the show. This is fun and silly.",1520726400,,500,4.01
