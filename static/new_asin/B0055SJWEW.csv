There are scenes of bullying, torture, criminal activity and sexual assault,etc. I don't think a PG-13 movie is suitable for the entire family. Lassie,The Painted Hills is such an old version of Lassie, it wouldn't hold anyone's attention.

I have got 2 frisbees in this packet. To say the least in my opinion the quality on these DVDs is terrible.
