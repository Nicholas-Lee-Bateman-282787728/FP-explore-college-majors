8085259,4,B000BD1ERE,"This DVD features decent presentations of two of Richard Harrison's early gladiator films made in Italy.  You can find them separately, but this is a good opportunity to have them both in one purchase.  It is surprising as the two-sided disc is sold in what looks like a dollar store product, but the now diminished availability has upped the price.  Both features are pretty much typical of sword and sandal epics produced by the early sixties Italian movie machines, probably borrowing costumes and sets from one another.  Richard Harrison is indeed a great find by them as he should have been a star in Hollywood than in Europe.  The cast of ""Gladiators Seven"" is a bit more inpressive than ""Invincible Gladitor"" as it has a classic ""Seven Samurai""-style plot, but ""Invincible Gladiator"" makes the most of what has been formulaic.  There are other, better ways to appreciate Richard Harrison.  His later wonderful Euro-spy films are getting DVD releases now and he, as always, shines.",1339632000,,987,4.9817073170731705
