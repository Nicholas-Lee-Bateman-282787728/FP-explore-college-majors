8630129,4,B00H5427IC,"Great show. I was afraid it was boring and outdated but it is a great show. For someone who is 71 years old and is in the (music) business for 4 decades along, it is remarkable by the intimacy of the performance, the tonality and soundeness of her voice and her joyfullness. Bethania kept us glued to the screen all along the show. An enormous class of one of the inspiring creators (and voices) of the 'tropicalia' movement. If you would like to see a great 1,5 hour show of fine brazilian music, well-recorded and performed don't hesitate. Rush yourself to buy this.",1454544000,,568,4.524271844660194
