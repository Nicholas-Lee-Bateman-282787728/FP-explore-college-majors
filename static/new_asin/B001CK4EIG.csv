3514057,1,B001CK4EIG,"This movie is an adaptation of a Japanese comic book.  Miike has done this before quite well (e.g. Osaka tough guys and the brilliant Fudoh The Next Generation).  Unfortunately, this one fails as a movie because, unless one has read the comic book (I haven't) the story is going to make little sense and the over the top stuff that makes a comic book fun makes the movies feel plastic and unreal.
The movie does have a lot of stuff that will appeal to the adolescent male, the target audience, the problem is that it should leave everyone else feeling a bit cold.
I turned it off about midway through, just couldn't sit through it, not worth the time.  Not worth yours either, unless you are a male between the ages of nine and fifteen and/or a manga reader (about the same demographic).
Love the director, hated this movie.",1264982400,,824,4.516778523489933
3514058,3,B001CK4EIG,"At Suzuran High School, teaching is an afterthought.  In a hyped up Japanese version of Lean on Me (without the happy ending), there are more gang influenced fights than National Honor Society meetings.  It's essentially a game of ""King of the Hill"", where the top dog - currently baby-faced student Serizawa (Yamada Takayuki) - must take on all challenges to his dominance.  In walks transfer student Genji (Shun Oguri), a brooding, beansprout-thin son of a Yakuza boss.

With the assistance of a moronic yakuza underling whose physical tendencies are reminiscent of a young Jerry Lewis, Genji assembles a gang to battle Serizawa for supremacy.  Unfortunately for Genji, the number of soldiers in Serizawa's gang is substantial, and he must pick up those who have yet to be dominated by Serizawa.

First up, a weak, underclassmen gang leader named Chuta (Suzunosuke).  It takes little time to beat him into submission.  Next, a scarfaced bully named Makise (Tsutomu Takahashi) is persuaded to join after getting some awkward help with the ladies.  Finally, a battle with Shun Izaki (Sosuke Takaoka), possibly the weakest looking of all the combatants, brings Genji's gang into shape.  An epic clash of the titans ensues between the two massive gangs.

The directing in this movie left something to be desired.  The number of loose, underdeveloped subplots is astonishing.  There is a Yakuza angle that is never really explored or tied in coherently.  There is a group of beautiful teenage love interests - namely Meisa Kuroki - that is completely useless to the story.  A biker gang and a kidnapping are thrown in blindly.  And then there is one of Serizawa's lieutenants who has brain surgery with no apparent assistance to the plot.  It's just plain sloppy.

For the most part, the filmmaking itself is fairly well done.  There are some great scenes showing a talented eye for artistry.  Also, the fight scenes and choreography are pretty exciting, with the final throwdown living up to the hype; although, there were a few poorly filmed angles early in the movie that clearly displayed missed punches.  The casting, on the other hand, is fairly pathetic in my opinion.  Aside from Takahashi, not a single person involved in the fighting has an imposing physique, or looks remotely tough.  It's really difficult to convey the ambitious thrust of this film when the actors look pre-pubescent.  Last but not least, the English voice-overs are atrocious; I'd much rather just have subtitles.

Overall I'd say this movie is lacking.  Miike may be great at taboo horror, but he's not great with action.  The plot potential is there, and I was hoping for an epic battle movie amidst a school setting, but it's like a head of hair that has gone a long time away from the barber: grungy and combative (fight scenes), with too many split ends (subplots).  The former are preferred; the latter is not.",1241308800,,2894,4.960498960498961
3514059,5,B001CK4EIG,"Let me make it clear: I don't like movies with too much violence. And I did not know much about Miike and his movies. The only reason I decided to watch this one was Oguri Shun, who plays the main character.

This movie is not just about fights. It's about friendship, diplomacy, strategy, heart. What does it mean ""being a leader""? There is a very good reason Suzuran never had a single leader: there was nobody with all these qualities. It's not enough just to be strong in this school, everybody here is strong.

And there is a good reason Genji's father wanted him in this school: he wanted his son to learn and acquire all these qualities. This will make him a much better person.

Love this movie. Very well done. Visually stunning. Excellent acting.",1238716800,3,756,4.544117647058823
3514060,4,B001CK4EIG,"Based on the Manga/Japanese comic book called ""Crows"" that runs monthly in a magazine, Takashi Miike (Audition) has scored a major box-office hit with ""CROWS:Zero"". Keep in mind, that this film is NOT one of his usual controversial, disturbing works but more of his commercial films. Miike has often been dubbed as one of the best directors alive (by Tarantino for one) and watching this film, one wouldn't be hard-pressed to see why. Miike mixes edgy comedic touches, pretty boys in fights and that manga-inspired atmosphere--all the more transforming high school life to seem like feudal warfare. The film is an energetic, rousing crowd-pleaser that seals the deal and has been hailed as one of the best manga adaptations to hit the screen.

Suzuran High school has a reputation as being the most notoriously chaotic, brutal schools in the nation. The students spend little or no time at all trying to get an education and spends most of their time organizing their gangs and fighting for supremacy as to who would rule the school--currently, a student named Tamao Serizawa (Yamada Takayuki) is the closest to achieving that goal, being called ""Hyaku Jyu Oh"" or ""King of the hundred Beasts"". Now, a transfer named Genji Takaya (Shun Oguri), the son of a yakuza lord has his eyes set on becoming the ruler of Suzuran to gain fame and his father`s respect. He befriends a bumbling yakuza henchman, Takajiri Ken (Yabe Kyosuke, Dead or Alive) and begins his journey in assembling a gang--using his fists to prove himself (to Izaki and Chute), and helping Maki (leader of a 2nd year gang) to meet chicks. The final showdown is about to begin...

Takashi Miike's direction is full of forward momentum, that it never lets up on its wicked energy to immerse the viewer. The film is highly entertaining and while its main premise is very simple, Miike manages to pull out major depth in his expression of just how the power structures of the gangs work which is basically analogous to feudal warfare, that includes sought after alliances--in this regard friendships are tested, where masculinity and fighting ability are the two factors that a young man can prove one's worth. Miike is a master of visuals and movement, and this film is just so full of eye-catching, awesome style. The film is at times full of outrageousness and black comedy, but he manages to let his characters grow on the audience by inserting some needed emotions in some of the film's sequences.

The characters are quite interesting and the director even gives them somewhat of a mythic personality and machismo. Maki is a dim-witted gang leader (no doubt due to the beatings he suffered) whom Genji manages to befriend by setting him up on a date. He sweats and reaches an orgasm when he sees a chick so he could never hook up. Izaki is the calculating and brutal leader (played by Takaoka Sousoke) who Genji impresses with his sheer guts and fighting spirit. Serizawa and Genji feel like they are two sides of the same coin. They have formed allegiances to become the ""top dog"". The script by Fudo Shugo also introduces a mythic legend about a school kid so tough that he doesn't need alliances; called the ""Rinda-Man"", who is said to be on another level to brutality.

Aside from the film's characterization, much of the film's main strength would have to come from the hyper-kinetic fight sequences. Keep in mind that this is Takashi Miike and no way would he shoot a super-choreographed fight. Ok, the fights may look very much ""manga-inspired"" and has somewhat of that anime feel--with the sounds and impact of the blows almost comic bookish. However, the action gets more brutal and bloody, and does have a touch of realism the longer we go into the film. The fights are nicely shot, with cool macho posturing and fun butt-kicking attitude in the sequences. The film did manage to keep its direction tight and solid to keep me intrigued as to who would win in the end.

The film is fun to watch and has the character skids from the comic book surface in the second half. Granted the story isn't really all that complex, it is quite very typical of other manga books in store shelves and isn't going to win any awards. The screenplay does seem to draw influences from other manga adaptations about gang wars from ""Be-Bop High School"", Sakigake! Otokujuku and even Walter Hill's ""Streets of Fire"". Genji's love interest, Ruka Aizawa is also underdeveloped and her character seems like only a device for breath-taking beauty Meisa Kuroki to show her talent as a J-pop star. The punk rock band, GINJIROU also provides some ""punk rock"" entertainment that complements Kuroki's hip-hop R/B performances.  There is also your typical brotherly man-love between Ken and Genji that offers up a subplot with the Yakuza. It may be clich for films of this kind but it does succeed in displaying its emotions.

Takashi Miike's ""CROWS ZERO"" is a film with a plot that offers little surprises but what made this film special is its strong energy in its momentum and over-the-top entertainment value. The film's characters are quite cartoonish, but they do have a tone of seriousness about them that provides balance. These pretty boys pretty much beat each other to a pulp, but it is not to the extent of brutality that is disturbing. There are no teachers in this film and the cops barely made an appearance--this is NOT a film to be taken seriously and if you do, it would be your fault. Miike's direction and visual manipulations are slick, cool, and full of outrageous style--it almost resembles a comic book video. This is Miike on his mainstream mode but he doesn't forget to pitch in some cultural prestige which makes it special. The film is reason enough for Western fans of the Japanese medium (anime, manga, bishonen heroes, video games) to rejoice and I am pretty sure fans of the comic won't have reason to complain either. For its male target audience, it is sure to be a hit! Rinda-Man is COOL!!

Highly Recommended! [4- Stars]",1238284800,,5999,4.794970986460348

3514065,5,B001CK4EIG,"There are a lot of reasons to love this movie.  The first is because this is the type of movie that would never get made in America, at least not without some serious revisions.  Second, I wish my high school was like this.  Sure, it was a big sausage fest, but it certainly would be fun.

Having grown up thinking that John Hughes films were the best possible outcome for high school, and seeing the current high school experience captured as a Disney musical or stupid, forgettable, comedies-Crows Zero gives a new perspective on the ""coolest possible"" high school experience.

Crows Zero is about the new guy in town trying to get to the top of his high school class.  But instead of getting good grades or being the quarterback with the cheerleader girlfriend, it's all about who can mobilize the best student army and pound the snot out of everyone else.  But, being a Takashi Miike film (Western Django, Ichi, Izo, DOA), it's gonna be more than a fistfight.

Crows is based on a multi-million selling manga.  It basically takes all the conflicts and angst that you find in high school and externalizes them.  Instead of stupid pranks or getting stuffed in a garbage can or trying to make the best grades or trying to get a varsity letter, it all comes down to how well you can brawl.  The ""School of Crows"" is known for being the toughest school in Japan,  And if you can survive, better yet, rise to the top, you can be whatever you want.

It's a cool premise.  One that could quickly degenerate into an adolescent orgy of senseless violence or could just come off very cheesy.  But Miike brings depth to the characters.  Despite everyone dressing in black, they all have their own distinctive styles (and it looks cool as hell).  And everyone broods really well.  I mean, it's an old-school James Dean, Brando-kind of brood.  Nowadays our emo generation in the US tries to brood, but it's just pouting and whining.  In Miike's hands it's sylistic and effective and makes you want to adopt a perma-scowl next time you leave the house.

Although the main character's run at the top is the primary story, there's a few side-stories involving peripheral characters that keep the movie from being 2-dimensional and shallow.  You get a sense of the kind of world where this story could take place, and the types of people that inhabit it (hint: it's a pretty cool world).

Character, story, depth, and the action is great.  No showy choreography here, everything is a straight-up brawl.  Think 'Fight Club' turned up to 11, fueled by out-of-control teenage testosterone.  Every time a fist connects with a face, you feel it.  The sound and camerawork make every punch and kick feel epic.  Every hit counts. And everything is captured in the very-stylistic Miike way.

So who's gonna like this movie?  The anime and manga crowd should dig it.  it definitely keeps its feel as a manga-made-real.  Those who were into Battle Royale and the contemporary, Japanese, teenage, ultraviolence.  I don't think this film is mature enough to appeal to the drama audience, despite having some fantastic characters and story elements.  Die-hard martial arts fans should probably pass.  If you like that cool asian style with some hardcore brawling action, all done by a top-notch production team and cast, equalling a movie that oozes nonchalant cool without forgetting to be fun, you'll be a 'Crows' fan, guaranteed.",1217721600,3,3405,4.792096219931271

3514123,2,B001CK4EIG,"I bought ""Crows"" because I was looking to fill out my Miike filmography. I've given it a lot of chances, and I just don't like it. It's really not too much in the execution - the movie looks great, has some interesting camera work, and the two leads are appealing. My problem is with the source material, the manga.
The entire premise is just BS. All this fighting, feints, strategies, machinations.....to take over a HIGH SCHOOL? Someplace after a few years you'd be out of? 30 minutes in, and the audience has heard endless names cataloging who's in charge of first year, second year, Class A, Class B, Class C.....the path to ""dominating"" Suzaran High School. Whatever. It's just stupid. There's no teachers at the school, just different classrooms to fight in. Honestly, after an hour and a half of tiny guys with anime hair throwing Dragonball Z haymakers, I didn't care how it ended between the students. I did like the Yakuza character Ken and how his story ended...unusually happy ending coming from Miike.
The movie, along with the title song, wants to say something about the indomitability of youth, choosing your own way....or not. It really doesn't matter. Along those lines, the ""hero lives in you"" song that plays during the last fight is really cheesy.
What becomes apparent after watching endless numbers of Japanese twinks brooding, smoking, fighting, and yelling - and knowing what any Internet watcher knows about Japanese guys - anyone else get the feeling they're REALLY overcompensating for something?",1370908800,,1524,4.980392156862745
3514124,4,B001CK4EIG,"Takashi Miike has had an interesting career. He's pretty much tried it all. Horror, comedies, yakuza, samurai... even a western. There really is no telling what he will take on next.

Crows Zero is a film based off the manga ""Crows"" by Hiroshi Takahashi. While I have not read the manga, I gather that the film is something of a prequel to it. As I have not read it, I can't say how well the film captures the characters or if it provides insight that was unknown before hand. I will say that it has MANY characters, and at times people show up for two scenes, have dialogue that makes them seem important and then they disappear for long portions (if not the entire) film. I'm operating under the assumption that these are characters in the manga that they wanted to include as a form of fan-service... which only slightly confuses the uninitiated.

Well, enough with my complaints (which depending on your knowledge of the manga, may not really be complaints at all). The film is fun... really fun. It has excellent fight scenes, a good sense of humor, and a few moments that are so over dramatic that I would usually complain, but in this case just came off as so silly that they only added to the fun. If you're looking for a fun movie from Miike, you could do worse. Now, if you are looking for a work of a grand auteur, you may want to skip this... That said, while Miike may be an auteur, when it comes right down to it, he's always made silly films too. His serious work is great, his silly work is great also. They're both entertaining styles that he puts on, but enjoyable in a different fashion.

Now, on to the Blu-ray's content! The picture is decent, but nothing amazing. I've seen DVDs with better picture, I've seen Blu-rays with worse. It gets the point across, and let's face it, this is not Miike's most visually fascinating film. It works though, but that's about it in terms of picture quality.

Special features are lacking. There's a trailer and an interview with Takashi Miike, which is 6 minutes of him explaining how he became interested in the project. This may be one of those features that really requires knowledge of the manga to really appreciate.

In closing: This is not Miike's best work, but taken as what it is, a fun little movie, it's worth a watch. The Blu-ray has decent picture and a few special features, but is not really awe inspiring. I'd still suggest it to fans of Miike and those of you out there who have read the manga.",1363996800,,2470,4.467849223946785

3514138,5,B001CK4EIG,"Suzuran is an infamous school where a `man's worth is proven by his fists.' Takashi Miike's Crow Zero is a hunger game for survival. We experience a story about a young punk kid (Genji Takaya) wanting to conquer the school, like every other attendee at Suzuran High. Students fight for control almost every day, but no one has ever completely managed to seize ultimate reign over the school. The closest to it is Tamao Serizawa.
Suzuran is divided into different gangs based upon their social class and reputation. The leaders establish their worth through their battles, fights and maintenance of the alliances. It all begins with our protagonist, (Genji Takaya) wanting to surpass his father' achievements, however through the journey, gaining more than what he originally bargained for. Crow Zero is a film about power, leadership, loyalty and self-development. It explores concepts of belonging and striving for all the wrong kind of achievements.
Now where to actually begin...this movie is certainly one Miike's most engaging and entertaining pictures. It is a beautiful, yet dark stroke of genius diving into an exaggerated society that unquestionably reflects our own in so many aspects. Crow Zero is most definitely a movie stretching beyond the concept of throwing a couple of punches. It is a piece of art and Miike's interpretation of our world. Brutal and breathtaking, there are hardly any flaws to the Japanese masterpiece. From the characters, to the originality of the plot, the soundtrack and even camera shots, Crow Zero earns a unique quality, seen in no other film.
The beauty of Suzuran is that no one has ever managed to control the school. It is an ongoing cycle. An endless marathon. There is always someone stronger and better than you. It is this notion of chasing dreams that encourages the viewers to keep watching.
One of my favourite things about the movie is the characters. Each character is utterly unique in their own way. Each character, whether they're bad or good, is able to capture the attention of its auidence.
I recommend viewers of Crows Zero to read the manga as well. Truley is a one of a kind movie. A picture oozing with style. And hopefully a part 3 will be made!!! Also, those who enjoyed Crow Zero, I recommend you watch Blue Spring (Aoi Haru) as well.

If you like that cool asian style with some hardcore brawling action, all done by a top-notch production team and cast, equalling a movie that oozes nonchalant cool without forgetting to be fun, you'll be a 'Crows' fan, guaranteed.",1271030400,18,3377,4.792096219931271

Awesome movie. Great action and fight scenes. It's my favorite movie.",1427414400,,285,4.480769230769231

If you haven't seen this movie and are into action/comedy or just looking for something new. This is the movie for you! I saw this with no english subs or dubbed and completey didn't know what was being said but still loved every minute of the film. It is not all about gangs and bs like that, there is actually something being said in the undertone of this film. Watch it for yourself and i'm 95% sure you will be reading the Manga right after. Enjoy",1420156800,,551,4.111111111111111
