2705394,5,B000LC3IM4,"No match listings for this dvd have been released so pay no attention to what anyone posts. WWE's website says we will see matches from WWE, WCW, ECW and SMW. I think the SMW is a typo seeing as Austin never wrestled there but he did wrestle for WCCW during its dying days so we may possibly see some matches from there with Chris Adams. He was not in ECW that long but did some great promos and parody's. I think he worked 2-3 matches during his tenure there with Mikey Whipwreck and Sandman. In WCW, they will probably show some tag matches with Brian Pillman and some of his battles with Ricky Steamboat. And of course from WWE, probably about every match will be blurred considering Austin was the star of the Attitude era. The only thing pre-attitude I can see them showing are his matches with Bret and the KOTR 96 win. He didn't do much post-WWF except his last match at Mania 19 with the Rock.",1179532800,5,901,4.337278106508876
2705395,5,B000LC3IM4,"THIS DVD SET WILL BE AWESOME. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT HAS TAKEN THIS LONG FOR WWE TO PRODUCE SUCH A SET. THIS SET OUGHT TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: 15-20 OF AUSTIN'S GREATEST MATCHES INCLUDING BATTLES WITH BRET HART, TAKER, ROCK, ANGLE, HHH, AND HBK. THIS SET WILL HOPEFULLY INCLUDE MATCHES FROM WCW WITH BRIAN PILLMAN IN THE HOLLWYOOD BLONDES AS WELL AS ECW MATCHES AND HIS FIRST WRESTLING MATCH ON TV. THERE WILL ALSO PROBABLY BE TONS OF OTHER EXTRAS FEATURING INTERVIEWS WITH AUSTIN'S FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES. I HOPE THEY GO INTO A LITTLE DETAIL ON HIS RIVALRIES WITH VINCE AND THE ROCK. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW THIS IS ALL PUT TOGETHER GIVEN THE FACT THAT AUSTIN'S CAREER WAS FILLED WITH SO MANY GREAT MOMENTS. HELL YEAH! I WILL BUY THIS DVD.",1175731200,2,738,4.514925373134329

2705442,5,B000LC3IM4,"I watch wrestling when I was much younger and didn't understand what was going on and the only people I knew where Hulk Hogan and Macho Man Randy Savage. Years later I would find a new appreciation for wrestling around 1997 and 1998, the Attitude Era. The biggest  name in wrestling at that time was Stone Cold Steve Austin. I admired his rebel with a cause attitude and to this day, I find myself popping in a WWE dvd to remind me of a great Attitude era of wrestling, which IMO was the greatest era for wrestling. Stone Cold, along with Chyna, The  Rock, The Undertaker, Kane, Mankind, etc helped me as an adolescent because on Monday nights I had something to look forward to. Purchase this DVD as a reminder, you won't be disappointed.",1440979200,,739,4.466666666666667
2705443,2,B000LC3IM4,"This would have been much better except for all the blurs.  WWE really needs to release a Steve Austin and The Rock DVD set now a days because now they can show the attitude era logo without blurs.  The blurs make most of this set unwatchable just like the Rocks set.  from about 2013 I think it was is when WWE made a deal with the WWF to be able to show their old footage and now is the time to release sets on the attitude era stars Austin, Rock, HHH, Undetaker, Foley, Angle.  WWE sets from the 2000s -2012 are unwatchable if it has alot of attitude era footage in it.  Skip this set.",1440547200,,588,4.078260869565217

2705445,4,B000LC3IM4,"This was such a great DVD, both match listing and commentary wise. My only complaints are that this is around the time when they were still blurring out the WWF scratch logo, which makes for a couple of awkward and intrusive looking camera angles. Also, the WWE conveniently leaves out the awesome heel turn in 2001 when he formed the Two Man Power Trip with HHH, along with Invasion stuff. Those heel run (though not good from a booking/popularity standpoint) was some of Austin's best character work. It was insulting at how they just ignored that. Besides that, this was/is a great DVD for not only Austin fans, but wrestling fans as a whole. Would definitely stand the test of time.",1435449600,,686,4.677685950413223

2705483,4,B000LC3IM4,"I think this is the better of the two WWE Stone Cold DVD's released. It lacks a documentary but has most of Austin's best matches. Over The Edge vs Dude Love is missing. We don't get Austin's big Wrestlemania 14 title win over Shawn Michaels but we get 1997 Shawn vs Austin at King of the Ring which is much better. Matches against Kane,Owen Hart, Rock, Triple H,Bret Hart and The Undertaker. We also get Shawn and Austin forming one of the best tag teams ever winning the titles over Bulldog and Owen.

After watching I realized something; he was a limited wrestler. There wasn't a lot of excitement and some matches I fast forwarded. If you are a fan of Stone Cold, then by all means purchase this. You might not be mad, but I doubt it. How many times can you watch a headlock, slam, forearm thrust, backdrop and then a stunner?

2705518,4,B000LC3IM4,"Hey...this is a very good DVD that tells the story of Stone Cold's life and career in chronological order...a little bit about his early days to when he started to become somewhat of the big name in WCW as Stunning Steve Austin then to Stone Cold Steve Austin in the WWE. I felt the way his story was presented was very well done because it showed how Stone Cold paid his dues for years and then ultimately became a really big star.
The DVDs have about 20 of his matches in their entirety, but I wish the Bret Hart submission match at Wrestlemania 13 would have been one of them. That was a really good match, and it was only referenced briefly and not shown in full like I think it should have.
Other than that though, this DVD is really good and any big Stone Cold fan would really like this DVD for sure.",1228348800,,807,4.212903225806452
2705519,2,B000LC3IM4,"I thought this DVD would be great since it talks about a great superstar.  The extras are good.  But throughout i think almost all of this dvd, there is background music when they are talking about steve austin or when steve austin is driving his truck, they are talking about him, but there is that stupid background music.  i don't need to hear that.  that made the whole DVD very stupid.  i rented this dvd, but could only watch half of it.

I expected interviews from peers and people in the business as well as spending more time on covering specific events.  The segments covering the McMahon feud, the Hollywood Blondes, time in ECW, etc, felt lackluster at best.  I expected more matches as well including his first WWE title win, Austin Vs. Hart submission match, and more. Stone Cold was an icon in WWE history and for this to be his big DVD.. it's a real waste.  Very disappointed.

I own the Bret Hart Collection and his ten minutes on Stone Cold was better than the Stone Cold dvd. You know how in the Bret Hart dvd, the DX dvd, and the Shawn Michaels dvd has not only the superstar talking, but the people they affected in the business? Guess what this dvd had, stone cold and he didn't look to happy to be there either. The dvd focuses more on wcw and ecw, than in wwe. He mentioned the rock and they had two matches on there. Not once did they have the Vince McMahon feud. They only had very few interviews which made me sad because the dude was hilarious and was damn good behind the mic. They had Austin 3:16 in there and Steveamania but thats it. His beginning matches are. . . .well boring as hell, his later matches good.

Nonetheless, Stone Cold was the man and I seriously doubt wrestling and the WWE will ever experience another boom like they did with him & The Rock, as well as with Hulk Hogan in the mid-80's.

A W/WW/F/E fan since the the days of Bob Backlund and Vince's canary yellow jackets, I lived for Monday nights from 1997-2001.  It's been completely downhill since Austin turned heel at WM-X7 in Houston (an awesome match with The Rock!).  The biggest glimmer of hope for me since was WMXX in '04 with Benoit winning the title at MSG.  That ended and we've been stuck with nothing but John Cena & HHHHHHHHH ever since.  Eh...

Austin's legacy will live on and probably haunt the McMahon's for generations to come as they'll never tap into another persona like Stone Cold's ever again.",1206403200,,976,4.6608187134502925

THOSE WERE SOME...MANY MATCHES WERE INCLUDED IN DVDS REALEACED BEFORE...U CAN SEE THE MATCHES OF THIS DVDS IN OTHER REVIEWS...THE DOCUMENTARY WAS NICE!!SOOOOOO THIS A MUST FOR ANY WRESTLING FAN!!",1206316800,,885,5.555555555555555
2705540,4,B000LC3IM4,"I am a really big fan of Stone Cold. I would not be a wrestling fan today if not for him. I had not watched wrestling for years until one night when the Nation of Domination were saying all of these things to Austin and Austin challenged them all. I really thought this guy was cool and he was great fun to watch. Unfortunately, this collection of matches and short commentary from Austin himself does not do the character justice.

The build up to the matches and the story lines were fantastic back in the late 90s. Wrestling fans and the general public would tune in to see him battle his boss. Monday Night Raw was almost like a wrestling show with the Stone Cold Steve Austin show going on in the background. At the end, he would usually come out on top. I remember when Stone Cold first told the Undertaker he would stomp a mudhole in his a-- and walk it dry. That stuff was hilarious. Or when Mr. McMahon went to Texas to find Austin. I could go on and on at how entertaining the stories were.

This DVD set only has Stone Cold discussing this match or that, and then they play the match. I don't even think anyone even discusses Austin's career the entire 3 DVDs. Vince doesn't talk about how his character helped save the company and ushered in the attitude era. J.R. doesn't talk about Austin setting records for PPV sells and merchandise sells. In the end, I think the legacy is left quite void.

The DVD of Vince McMahon, McMahon, does have quite a bit about his fued with Austin and they do a nice job of it. There is another video titled Austin vs. McMahon which is really great and maybe WWE felt DVDs like it and others have covered Stone Cold's career to death and they just wanted him to go out talking a little about his life in wrestling and cover a few highlight matches a long the way. If that's the case, they did an okay job. Just be aware of it before you purchase. It might not be what you are expecting.",1206144000,2,1930,4.282191780821917
2705541,2,B000LC3IM4,"This was suppouse to be a documentary, but you only get like a few commentaries from Austin and then pure old wrestling matches, not that I don't like Austin wrestling matches, but I was expecting more historic facts.",1205452800,,217,4.7368421052631575
2705544,5,B000LC3IM4,"So Far so Good for the WWE this 2008.  This DVD is a great collection of Stone Cold.  What I like the most, is the format He speaks, then a complete match.

Also you see a side of Stone Cold you don't see on TV, the human side, were he explains his injuries, personal opinions, etc.

The only thing is the DVD ends with the Wrestlemania X7 match vs the rock, he still goes one more year, then gets terminated for the injury, appearing ocacionally and doing movies, I would have loved to see that.

This is a MUST HAVE if you are a Steve Austin Fan.",1205280000,,548,4.08411214953271
2705545,5,B000LC3IM4,"This is a great addition if you like stone cold. It shows alot of his old matches. Alittle less talking than i would like, i was hoping for more in depth stuff but its by far an awsume dvd.",1205193600,,189,3.871794871794872
2705546,3,B000LC3IM4,"First I would like to say, being a die hard Stone Cold fan, I could not wait to get my hands on this DVD. I can't say thre DVD isn't good, but I was very disappointed. I can not believe the little attention that was given towards the Austin vs. Mcmahon feud. Three matches that I though with no question, would be on this set. Austin vs. Mcmahon, Austin vs. Brett Hart, submission match and the first blood match Austin vs Undertaker. How could this DVD set not have at least one of these three matches on it. Should have at least Austin vs. Mcmahon match. DVD is ok, but disappointing.",1205193600,9,586,4.288288288288288
2705547,5,B000LC3IM4,"I just finished watching this set over the weekend and I have to say overall, its worth the money. Here are what I feel are the pros and cons of this release:

PROS:
You hear from the man himself, Steve Austin. He is quite frank about his career and even mistakes he made along the way including WCW. I also liked his ECW interviews which were a precursor to his ""Stone Cold"" promos later on. I also liked seeing a lot of matches that haven't been released or only released maybe once such as his bout with Mick Foley from Unforgiven '98 or with The Rock from Backlash '99. My favorites are his bout with Ricky Steamboat in his WCW days and his first encounter with Bret Hart at Survivor Series '96. A match that I feel is just as good if not better than their more known WrestleMania 13 match.

CONS:
I wish there would've been a section with others talking about Austin. I also wish they would've included other matches past his 2001 encounter with The Rock on here such as his matches with Kurt Angle, his rare one on one encounter with Ric Flair in 2002 prior to him walking out on WWE which was followed by his domestic violence charge over his now ex-wife Debra and his ""bout"" with Eric Bischoff from No Way Out 2003. Any one of those matches could've took the place of his Survivor Series 2000 bout with Triple H which was an okay bout but edited because of The Radicalz attack on Austin. The Radicalz of course featured the now infamous Chris Benoit. While I respect their legal right to edit footage as they see fit, I personally would've rathered the match been left off if it wasn't going to be shown in its entirety.

Overall, its still a good ride and worth your cash, even if the story is only half told.",1205193600,,1718,4.329192546583851
2705548,5,B000LC3IM4,"The newest offering from the WWE takes a look at the career of one of the most popular and charismatic Superstars in professional wrestling. It follows his early career at the Sportatorium in Dallas, Texas, home of World Class Championship Wrestling, where Austin was trained by ""Gentleman"" Chris Adams and debuted as Steve Williams (his given name), but when he went to Memphis and the USWA, Dutch Mantel came up with his new nickname, Steve Austin (later ""Stunning"" Steve Austin). He moved on to WCW and won the TV title, and matches with Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat are shown as well, along with tag matches (and matches against) Brian Pillman (he and Pillman were known as The Hollywood Blondes). After an injury, Austin is fired from WCW and is given a call by ECW founder Paul Heyman, and he goes to ECW and cuts some promos, targeting former boss Eric Bischoff and Hulk Hogan, and having a match with Mikey Whipwreck and the Sandman for the ECW title (which he lost). Austin is next shown in WWE, where he faces Savio Vega in a Caribbean Strap Match and loses, thereby sending his manager Ted Dibiase packing from the organiation. He moves on to win the King of The Ring 1996, then enters into a feud with Bret ""Hitman"" Hart, losing a match at Survivor Series '96, then is seen facing the Undertaker in a title match and losing thanks to the Hart Foundation. He also wins two WWE tag team titles with Shawn Michaels and Dude Love (Mick Foley), but also faces off against Michaels and Foley later down the road. He also faces Owen Hart and is given what is called a ""stinger"" which is a temporary paralysis caused by a neck injury (Hart gave him a Tombstone Piledriver), but Austin pins Hart for the Intercontinental Title but is forced to give it up due to his neck injury. He is out for a few weeks but returns and reaks vengeance on Hart, and enters into a feud with Mr. McMahon, who attempts to make him his corporate champion after Austin finally wins the WWE title. In a First Blood Match at King of The Ring 1998, Kane defeats Austin for his first and only WWE Title, but Austin regains it one night later on Raw. The Rock enters the sights of Austin next, and they trade the WWE Title back and forth, then Austin targets the man who co-conspired to take him out of action permanently, Triple HHH, in two violent matches. This DVD set is really quite well-done and gets a rating of 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.",1204934400,,2417,4.470588235294118
2705549,4,B000LC3IM4,well presented documentary from his humble beginnings up to the redneck triathlon. not much extras but entire dvd is jam packed. blurring of wwf logo kinda annoys me while watching the dvd. it's a must have for any wrestling dvd collection and stone cold fans.,1204416000,,260,4.8
2705550,5,B000LC3IM4,"This is it! The video collection that ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin fans have been waiting for! THE LEGACY OF STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN,  focuses on Austin's MATCHES, unlike other previous efforts,such as<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Cause-Stone-Cold-Said-So/dp/B00019GHTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE - 'Cause Stone Cold Said So</a>that more or less, dealt with his humorous,out-of-the-ring theatrics. For those new to ""The Rattlesnake's"" career, Austin's wrestling style revealed his admiration for the work of
some of pro-wrestling's most notorious hellraisers: Lou Thez, The Road Warriors, Harley Race, Terry Funk and ""The Ace"" Cowboy Bob Orton, Austin took from these men what he could; combined their ""signature moves""  with his God-given gift for gab, to create a diverse and entertaining wrestling arsenal. There is action galore in this collection where Stone Cold battles the likes of  Bret Hart, The Undertaker, Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, Shawn Michaels, Triple H, The Sandman and of course, his
arch-nemesis, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson!

 This 3-disc collection is divided into three stages of
Austin's career, from The early years, to the ascent to the top of the wrestling world then concluding with the ""Last Hurrah"". In (thankfully) brief segments, Austin recalls his stints in the WWE and WCW, of course, but a welcome surprise is the emphasis he places on the first promo he cut for ECW, an anti-Bischoff,anti-Dusty Rhodes rant that seemed to excite his fellow wrestlers who were looking on, revealing a hint of the greatness that was yet to come. For added value, the WWE packagers also included on each disc's menu page, the songs ""The Stone Cold Theme"", ""Hell, Yeah"" and ""Unbreakable"", all of which I gleefully let play in their entirety before watching the matches.

  And what matches! Some of these were released for the first time on DVD and they feature ""Stone Cold"" at his best: nearly uncontrollable mayhem in the tradition of the old NWA! There are one or two
relatively weak macthes early on,(Austin v. Mikey Whipwreck v. Sandman; Austin v. Yokozuna) but the hi-light of the set is the ""Three Stages of Hell"" match Stone Cold had with Triple H at 2001's NO WAY OUT  pay-per-view, a grueling ""best of three""-fall rumble that ended inside a steel cage; both men struggling to out-do the other in what became a battle of wills!

  Face it, this  is the best WWE collection since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-The-Ultimate-Ric-Flair-Collection/dp/B0000DIJOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE - The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection</a>&nbsp;came out a whopping

Particularlly the Anything goes match that Austin, Terry Funk, Mick Foley, and the late Owen Hart had against HHH, Jesse James, Billy Gun, and Savio Vega who was replacing Shawn Michaels.  But I guess since that match was so brutal and unsanctioned that the wwe decided against it.  I was also hoping they would include a few more matches from the WCW days like the legendary tag team match him and Pillman had against Flair and Anderson and a few of the matches that Austin mentions in his book.  I am glad they are including the famous Red and Yellow skit in there from WCW.

A good DVD that could have been better. They skipped over so many great moments its sickening.

I don't understand why the Yokozuna bout was in on here, its good but way to short. I also don't understand why WWE has done away with promo's on there dvd sets. Austin was best on the microphone and the only promo on this set was from ECW. It also skipped over the whole McMahon feud come to think of it and that was plain stupid, considering its what made Austin a household name. I do like the menu for the dvd, probably the best WWE has every done. All in all, Austin fans will love it. Wrestling fans will but they'll notice a few matches missing. You cannot please everyone.",1202774400,2,714,4.257352941176471
2705565,4,B000LC3IM4,"NOTE: I updated this review in 2012.

Stone Cold Steve Austin will go down as one of the biggest (or according to WWE, THE biggest) names in the history of the wrestling business with WWE releasing another tape/DVD profile featuring him.  This set is different than all of his other ones in that this wasn't a documentary presentation but instead was an anthology of matches with Austin commenting on certain things in between each match such as getting started in the business, his relationship with Brian Pillman, WCW, ECW, from The Ringmaster to Austin 3:16, his WrestleMania matches against Bret Hart & Shawn Michaels & The Rock, Mick Foley, being WWE Champion, Owen Hart & the infamous piledriver, his neck injury & surgery, Eddie Guerrero, and Triple H.  It should also be noted that despite the DVD insert advertised his ""Redneck Triathlon"" against Eric Bischoff as a DVD extra, it's not on this set.

Matches Include:
WCW Tag Team Championship/Steel Cage Match w/Brian Pillman (Hollywood Blondes) vs. Dos Hombres - Before I get started, a few things need to made clear in that the match was already advertised as the final encounter between Ricky Steamboat & Shane Douglas in a steel cage but Douglas was fired from WCW right before the PPV.  A new masked tag team of ""Dos Hombres"" appeared advertised as two luchadors beat the Blondes in a non-title match shorty before the PPV to get the title match here but with Douglas gone, Tom Zenk wrestled under the mask but was portrayed as if it was Douglas under the mask.  So it was one of those gimmicks like Dusty Rhodes' ""Midnight Rider"" or Hulk Hogan's ""Mr. America"" where everyone had a clear idea who was under the mask but couldn't prove it.
The Blondes went for the mask early causing one of the Hombre to respond by throwing him into the cage multiple times along with being punished with both a backdrop & atomic drop before Pillman received the same treatment being pressed into the cage.  The Hombres used the cage in a unique way as Austin was hung upside down on the cage & given a running crossbody block sandwitching him between their body & the cage but Austin fell before the second attempt hurting his back but also causing the other Hombre to fly into the cage which allowed an opening for the Blondes to take control using their tactics of double teaming & dirty tactics to maintain their advantage.  This cage match wasn't much past Austin & Pillman taking some hard bumps into it throughout the match & what Steamboat did at the very end but the whole story behind the ""Dos Hombres"" & it really not being Douglas did hurt this match.
WCW Slamboree 93
[Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon]

vs. Brian Pillman - Only a short time after the previous match would Pillman injure his ankle while the Blondes would not only lose the tag titles but also break up as a team when Austin chose Col. Parker as his manager over Pillman as his partner. Pillman jumped Austin in the ring before the bell & brought the fight to Austin including a hard chop that knocked him down before Austin was able to gain some offense working over the ankle with moves like the half crab. Both men went back & forth from here before Col. Parker would once again be the factor in the issue between both men here. The match wasn't long but really came off as a high intense grudge match.
""WCW Clash Of The Champions"" Nov. 93
[Best Of Clash Of The Champions]

WCW United States Championship Match vs. Ricky Steamboat - This match had a special stipulation in that Austin could lose the championship on a disqualification. Steamboat's offense consisted of grounding Austin with headlocks & armbars & chops including delivering one that knocked down Austin to the ground before working over his arm including using the ring post. Both men would continue to trade chops while Austin would continue to mock Steamboat by slapping him around & shoving his face into the ground including one moment when Steamboat went for a superplex only for Austin to knock him off & have Steamboat land on his tailbone. Austin has said that Steamboat was his favorite guy to be in the ring with & you'll see why here as they gave a performance in a series of matches that would be overshadowed by the Hogan/Flair feud in WCW like how it did during this match itself. This match would later hold more importance as it would turn out to be Steamboat's last match for up to 15 years as he retired the next month.

""ECW Hardcore TV"" Oct. 95
[ECW: Path Of Destruction; Stone Cold Truth; Stone Cold Steve Austin: The Bottom Line]

vs. ECW Champion Mikey Whipwreck vs. Sandman - After Austin's embarrassing defeat by Whipwreck at the previous event, he came into this match more serious (such as his Bruce Willis ""Pulp Fiction"" buzz haircut) & showing more respect to Mikey with clean breaks in the corner & handshakes before he would eventually get more aggressive towards Mikey.  Sandman eventually joined the match minutes later causing Mikey to attempt to go after both men with a frankensteiner & dive over the top rope before Austin & Sandman brawled on the outside going in the crowd with Austin using whatever he could get his hands on including a table, chair, ringside cable, and later some brass knuckles while continuing to mock Sandman with his own beer.  This wasn't much as far as a triple threat match goes as it came off more as a gauntlet match for Austin with him fighting Mikey in the first half & Sandman in the second half & isn't really only relevant as being Austin's second & last match in ECW.
""ECW Hardcore TV"" Dec. 95
[ECW: Deep Impact]

Strap Match vs. Savio Vega - This strap match was held under the traditional rules of the winner being the person to touch all four corners without interruption & was the rematch from their previous strap match only 2 days earlier (due to the power being out in the arena during the match) with the stipulations that Savio would be Dibiase's chauffeur if he lost but Dibiase would leave the WWE if Austin lost.  Austin stalling early by trying to prevent Savio from getting into the ring & going to the outside multiple times only for Savio to use the strap to bring Austin back in with the strap coming into play multiple times for both men as they used it whip each other loudly, Austin backdropped Savio over the top rope to the floor only for the strap to cause him to over with him, and later Savio yanking Austin off the top rope onto the guardrail.  Both men came close to touching the forth corner only to be stopped as they were giving as much punishment as they received like when Savio delivered a superplex that took as much out of him as it did Austin & later both men reversing the others attempt at a tombstone until one of them fell over the top rope while there was a point where Austin had the match won only for Dibiase to demand more punishment which would end up working against Austin.  The only fault I can say here is that the match ended the same way this type of match has ended a high majority of times but past that, this was a very underrated match in Austin's career as they worked well against each other while dishing out a heavy amount of punishment with the strap & the story behind Dibiase & Austin only adding more to the match.
""In Your House: Beware Of Dog 2"" May 96

vs. Bret Hart - This was Bret's in-ring return to WWE after WrestleMania XII & taking some time off during the year against the man who kept calling him out & challenging him for months.  Both men targeted specific parts of the body early on with Bret working over Austin's arm with by constantly applying a hammerlock while Austin focused on Bret's neck with a side chinlock & elbows along with using the ropes & choking.  The match started to turn more aggressive as time went with both men trading fist & Austin spearing Bret into the turnbuckle chest first before the fight was taken to the outside from the front row to the spanish table with a guardrail getting broken in the process.  Both were still dishing out heavy punishment with Austin delivering a suplex that knocked the wind out of both men & Bret giving Austin a piledriver with both men stealing one of the others signature moves to the point where they each used a maneuver that we haven't seen the other use in recent memory.  While this match would be overshadowed by their later WrestleMania encounter, this was a lost classic as far as their in-ring quality performances.
Survivor Series 96

vs. WWE Champion Undertaker - The Hart Foundation were sitting at front row ringside during this match as they both had unfinished business with both Austin & Taker to the point where Austin ended up pulling one of the members over the rail early in the match to attack only for Undertaker to punch him right back over the rail into his seat.  Austin & Taker then focused on each other with both men focusing on each others legs using the ring post & ropes along with other various holds such as elbow drops, spinning toe hold, and clip from behind only for Austin to get desperate delivering a low blow right in front of the referee & showing him behind his back what he thought of his authority only for Taker & the referee to give Austin the treatment right back.  They would go on to have better matches as this was still entertaining but really only here to further push the feud between Austin & Hart Foundation while also continuing to plant the seeds for the future showdown with Undertaker.
""In Your House: Cold Day In Hell"" May 97

w/Shawn Michaels vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Owen Hart & British Bulldog - With both Shawn Michaels & Steve Austin having issues with the Hart Foundation for months, they accepted the challenge for this tag title match despite not liking or trusting each other with this also being Shawn's first match back since his knee injury & forfeiting the WWE Championship 4 months earlier.  Both men went after the Owen & Bulldog as they made their way to the ring with Shawn performing like he didn't miss any time as both teams were trading momentum back & forth with Shawn & Austin working together with quick tags while Bulldog & Owen kept working over Shawn with double teaming & distracting the referee.  This was a good main event for RAW as the action was non-stop with an aftermath that still put over the story of both Shawn & Austin having a common enemy but that didn't mean they were friends.
""RAW"" June 97
[Monday Night War]

vs. Shawn Michaels - This match was one of the most unusual in WWE history at this time based off the setup alone as both men were Tag Team Champions who didn't get along but had a common enemy in the Hart Foundation who were instrumental in both men having this match in the first place. Despite both men having different personalities, Austin being no-frills while Shawn was the flashy type, each one didn't have a problem showing their rebellious personality early as they both knocked the other down & gave them the middle finger early in the match before it got more competitive as time went with both men trading momentum back & forth to the point where a cameraman got knocked off the ring. Just like how I stated that each man had a common rebellious attitude, that would heavily come into play in the end when both men were not happy with the referees officiating leading to both men seeing eye to eye despite still not trusting each other.
King Of The Ring 97
[Best Of The King Of The Ring]

WWE Tag Team Championship Match w/Dude Love vs. Owen Hart & British Bulldog - Due to Shawn Michaels taking an absence from WWE, Austin needed a partner & Mankind kept asking but Austin said no because Mankind was a freak so he went at it alone & dominated until the numbers game & double teaming finally caught up to him before his ""partner"" showed up causing Austin to have big ""What The Hell?"" look on his face.  The match itself wasn't much as this was all about the debut of Dude Love.
""RAW"" July 97

vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Owen Hart - Austin put a stipulation on his match that he would kiss Owen's ass if he didn't win the championship with Owen started the action right away by clipping Austin's leg & trying to work over the leg while Austin recovered working over Owen's arm causing Owen to get more aggressive to the point where he was trying to break Austin's fingers.  Both men traded momentum throughout the contest with very close near falls before Owen worked over Austin's neck with various holds like a top rope elbow, camel clutch, german suplex, and DDT before they eventually moved into the one hold that this match was infamous for & changed not just Austin's career but his life forever.  This was a good match between both men but will forever be overshadowed by the final moments.
SummerSlam 97
[The Stone Cold Truth]

WWE Championship Match vs. Dude Love - This was Austin's first television title defense after WrestleMania against a different Dude Love than he partnered with only months earlier with the additional factor that Mr. McMahon made it clear that he didn't want Austin as the WWE Champion & promised to be at ringside during Austin's title match when the last time McMahon was at ringside was when the ""screwjob"" happened at Survivor Series.  Dude jumped Austin from behind but then tried to get away from Austin when that didn't work only for Austin to catch up to him & took the fight to the outside to the point where Dude was thrown off the band stage before Dude was able to slow down the momentum & ground Austin.  The action went back & forth when Mr. McMahon decided to sit at ringside & came into play various times taunting Austin to get back in the ring & even telling the referee to not count Austin out since the title couldn't change that way & later making a signal towards the timekeeper when Dude had Austin in a submission attempt before the match got taken to the outside with Dude taking a hard hit into the steps & fighting in the crowd then making it's way back to ringside where a chairshot was delivered...but the person hit nobody expected.  This was more of a teaser to build to their more famous match at Over The Limit the next month but still a good encounter.
Unforgiven 98

WWE Championship/First Blood Match vs. Kane - The stipulations to this match were made very clear that the match wouldn't end on a scrape or minor blood flow (like a nose bleed) but had to be a heavy amount of blood for the match to be stopped along with Kane's added clause that he would set himself on fire if he didn't win the championship.  Both men started brawling both in & out of the ring when the Hell In A Cell (used earlier in the night in the Taker/Mankind match) started to lower almost crushing on Austin's neck as they continued to brawl with the Cell being raised again with Kane trapped in the doorway. They continued to brawl to the stage area & back at ringside as Austin kept targeting Kane's face using the steps, the announce table & the objects on it, and his punches but Kane's mask kept protecting him while he used his power to keep gaining an advantage over Austin before the Cell came back down & others who had their history with Austin & Kane made their presence felt as well.  Normally I don't like ""First Blood"" matches as they always stop the match after every hard hit to check for blood which kills any momentum the match can have but they didn't do that here as they just let them fight until we saw someone bleeding which made a good encounter.
King Of The Ring 98
[The Twisted & Disturbed Life Of Kane]

vs. WWE Champion Kane - This was the rematch the next night with them picking up where they left off with brawling before Kane gained the power advantage like pressing Austin into the guardrail while Paul Bearer got his hit in while Undertaker made an appearance at ringside to observe what was going on.  This match was pretty short & sweet only serving the purpose of Austin getting even with EVERYONE for what happened the night before while continuing to build the storyline that would be known as the ""Highway To Hell.""
""RAW"" June 98

WWE Championship Match vs. The Rock - This was the rematch from WrestleMania XV with The Rock with Austin on a mission to get back his personalized ""Smoking Skull"" title which The Rock was wearing. Both men traded fist right from the bell with Shane distracting Austin for Rock to gain an advantage followed by both men trading momentum before both men brawled to the stage area as both men were thrown into the set at one point with various weapons used like the cable cord, fire extinguisher, guardrail, and anvil case. The fight went back to ringside with Rock being able to put Austin through the spanish table & even showed he was diverse at being able to not only do commentary but also be a camera man. Shane continued to show his bias as a referee by constantly taking causing distractions, making threats, and even taking weapons away from Austin & giving them to The Rock but it would eventually backfire in Austin's favor before Austin would receive some help from the last man he would ever expect it from. This match definitely topped their Mania match from the previous month & one of the best matches in their epic feud.
(Special Referee - Shane McMahon)
Backlash 99

vs. Eddie Guerrero - In a nutshell, this match was was pretty short & sweet only as it went under 5 minutes with Austin being dominate a majority of the time.

No Disqualification Match vs. Triple H - It was around this time that Triple H revealed that he was the mastermind behind Rikishi running Austin over with a car a year earlier leading to this match that had a No Disqualification stipulation added earlier in the show.  Austin dominated early with his trademark Thesz Press & elbow drop before they went to the outside brawling to the stage area & backstage to back around ringside using whatever they could get their hands on from the steel steps to the monitor that caused Triple H to be heavily bleeding while Austin would have some ""Steveweisers"" in between each beating.  Triple H was able to target Austin's neck with elbows, countering the neckbreaker into the stunner & having the vice using the ringpost before the brawling continuing on the outside through the announce table all the way backstage to the parking lot where Austin trapped Triple H & committed an act that caused the last words for us to hear from Triple H being ""HOLY S...!""  Now it should be noted that the ending of the match was edited to exclusive the involvement of Chris Benoit but that was only a total of less than 30 seconds & had no real effect on the match itself or the aftermath as Austin & Triple H always had that chemistry & gave you a main event quality encounter despite the fact that Triple H did have a back injury going into this match.
Survivor Series 00

3 Stages Of Hell Match vs. Triple H - This was the first ever ""3 Stages Of Hell"" match which was a traditional 2 Out Of 3 Falls match with the twist being that each different fall would be contested under a different stipulation which in this case was the falls being a regular match, street fight, and a steel cage if the third fall was necessary (and lets be honest, they wouldn't tease all 3 falls & not do them).  Triple H targeted Austin's previously injured neck right away with various neckbreakers & blows directly on the neck before also attacking Austin's bad knees using the ringpost & figure four.  Both men began brawling on the outside throughout the crowd eventually making their way through the spanish table using whatever was around them from the monitors to a chair with Triple H even using Mick Foley's ""Barbie"" to bust Austin before he returned the favor with his ""Steveweiser"" before both men used the chair in their unique way with Triple H executing a neckbreaker on it & Austin's head landing on it after a back suplex with Austin nailing a chairshot that busted Triple H open as well.  The match did to go the third fall with both men using the cage to their advantage while the weapons from the street fight were still in the ring & used to their advantage from ""Barbie"" to the sledgehammer with both men were able to execute either the pedigree or stunner they beat each other into exhaustion to the very end where it took both men several moments just to stand after the match.  As I stated earlier, this match was the first of it's kind that also had a big buildup going into it as their feud had been going on for over a year but definitely was a WrestleMania quality encounter.
No Way Out 01
[Triple H: That Damn Good]

No Disqualification Match vs. WWE Champion The Rock - You could feel the tension between both men for weeks & it exploded right from the start when Austin attacked Rock during his entrance with both men blocking each others signature moves early with even Rock attempting Austin's own stunner. Both men brawled on the outside with Austin hit the Rock with the ringbell busting him open right away before they took it back into the ring with them trading momentum as Rock returned the favor to Austin with the ringbell causing him to bleed. Both men pulled out all stops using the ringpost & monitor while both attempted the moves like a sharpshooter, the ""Million $ Dream"" that we hadn't seen in years, and Rock delivering Austin's own stunner. However what this match is most memorable for happened when Vince McMahon appeared & his involvement showing how someone would ""sell their soul"" to become the champion. Jim Ross described this match best on commentary, ""Off The Page Intense!""

(DVD Extra) vs. Yokozuna - This was one of Yokozuna's last TV appearances and this match was also really nothing special between the two past the ending where the top rope couldn't hold his weight for the bonzai drop & Austin took advantage.
""SummerSlam Free-For-All"" Aug. 96

DVD extras include Austin talking how he got his name, his comments on Terry Funk followed by a confrontation he had with Funk on ""Shotgun Saturday Night"", talking about his feud with Mr. McMahon, confronting Mr. McMahon & Johnathan Coachman in regards to being Vince's son, the WrestleMania 21 ""Gladiator"" spoof with a behind the scenes look.  In the end, this set was designed to focus more on Austin's in-ring performances than his life story or out of the ring moments so this is recommended for those who are a strictly a fan of his in-ring performances but if you love Austin for his more outrageous moments then I would pass on this one.",1200700800,24,23010,4.550423216444982

If you haven't read it, get a copy asap.  But my main reason for writing this is, if what I see here is the case, the King of the Ring where Austin 3:16 was created is not even on this disc.  I know the date was June 23, 1996.  That's when Stone Cold won a match at KOR, got stitches, and came back and beat Jake the Snake Roberts and cut the famous promo where he said ""Austin 3:16 says I just kicked your a**!""  If that is not on this disc, and I'm talking each match from the event and the whole promo, then this disc gets 2 stars off right away.""

As i said i was really surprised to see this in JBHIFI as i didn't think it was out. I haven't watched it all. I noticed its mostly just Austin talking between the matches. Not many other wrestles giving their views on the rattle snake.

I would have loved a complete doco like the Hitmans dvd.

Still anything with Austin in it is very worthy of a purchase.",1200096000,5,1718,3.9478260869565216

8161439,5,B000LC3IM4,"Well, almost. Not that Austin wasn't a hellraiser for all of his career, but the thing that jumped out to me on the final disc--and I think I always knew this--is that Austin's great run as a heel in 2001 was entirely omitted. I already knew Steve himself hated that at that stage of his career (What), but I always thought it was a great re-invention of his character--and aside from that obvious word--there were just too many funny moments not to have at least a sample here.

At any rate, I'm sure there are other Austin DVDs. As for this one, not shabby at all, as far as matches picked & Stone Cold himself probably being his harshest critic as far as his own view of his matches; apparently WM 14 really sucked. Some of the more obvious stuff is already covered, like the issues with WCW & ECW and some of those legendary shoots.

Jumping to WWE, Austin 3:16, the 6-time World Champ--it's all pretty much covered. I guess the last match to close out Disc 3 was the best of the series, even beating the Austin/Rock finale 2003.

His commentary seems like he doesn't want to talk and is limited, maybe he was having a bad day.
