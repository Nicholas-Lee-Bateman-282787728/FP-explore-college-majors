8454837,4,B000DZQITO,"This DVD is actually two DVDs on the one disc. Labyrinths plays first, then Dragonquest. I though Labyrinths was fantastic - this was all completely new to me and although the footage was quite old, it was good and the amount of information was great and was presented well. It has stirred enough curiousity in me to go out and seek more knowledge about this fascinating phenomena, and to have a go at walking a labyrinth myself. Dragonquest was a little disappointing in comparison,and the soundtrack was not as good, but still quite informative.",1206057600,,547,4.829787234042553
