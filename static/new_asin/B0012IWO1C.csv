8246192,3,B0012IWO1C,"I was sent 2 copies of this order. Liked the acting but the camera work was too mechanical. It seemed to lack a true perspective where this film was headed. The extras failed to give the boys thoughts and didn't really involve him in the movie. Like he was an extra when I believe he was the best newcomer to the movie industry since Christian Bale. Really believable acting on his part. Others performed as expected. Nothing new,nothing borrowed and everything blue. Too much dialogue in the way of background info. Could have been better time spent in showing the viewer more difficult circumstances or character acting in where this film was going.overall I give it a 2&1/2stars for the plot and acting.",1292716800,,706,4.747967479674797
