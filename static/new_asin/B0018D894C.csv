8269560,3,B0018D894C,"La Vedova Scaltra (The Cunning Widow) is based on Carlo Goldonis play, and it seems thats the main reason it was produced and staged in Venice in 2007. Its a comedy that allows for some good theater and some tuneful music.  This production is theatrically very good, colorful and enjoyable. The best musical scene is the last one. The rest is fine, but not incredible exciting.  The singers do a very good job theatrically and musically. The musical style is out of its time, meaning it appears to be composed much earlier than the 1930s when it was premiered in Rome.  I would recommend this DVD to those interested on watching this seldom produced opera, since I don't expect it to be produced or staged with any frequency.
A technical note:  The second DVD (acts II and III) didn't have English subtitles.",1524787200,,808,4.669014084507042
8269561,4,B0018D894C,"I was not familiar with Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari before watching this dvd. He was born in Venice in 1876 and died in 1948, with much of his opera music composed later in his career, including this one. He was apparently artistically (and psychologically) torn between Italy and Germany (his mother was venetian and his father was German), never fully comfortable with either country, culture or artistic language. His most well known composition is the opera Sly which is performed occasionally, This piece- virtually never.

Le Vedova Scaltra (The Cunning Widow) is a highly entertaining and surprising piece. I say surprising because this is really an Italian opera buffa a-la Domenico Cimarosa or Giovanni Paisiello (or Mozart), but it was composed in 1931!! Trust me, if I didn't tell you (or you didn't read the informative booklet), you would never have known it wasn't from the late 18th century. It is that authentic. I did hear some echoes of Puccini at times, but really the musical vocabulary, libretto, and characterizations are from that much earlier period. AND, very effectively so.

The story is simply about a lovely wealthy widow (with a lovelier and comic maid) being wooed by four suitors- from France, Italy, Spain and Italy. (Money is not really their object as they all appear to be well off.) There is some play with the national aspects of the characters (especially the Spanish duke.) There are plenty of comic scenes (though not as farcical as in Barber of Seville), and a few beautiful romantic melodies. In addition, there is the character Arlecchino (see, this also dates from that earlier buffa era) as an independent waiter/servant helping the men in their pursuits.

It is all very light, the musical numbers are very good, and all the performances are quite good. Special mention for Alex Esposito as Arlecchino (quite funny). I want to highlight that I thought the staging/direction was particularly effective. This is a live performance from La Fenice (Venice).

I note that this was a Dynamic release, and their dvds are usually excellent. This is true here, though this is NOT a Hi Def recording. Still, all technical aspects are very good, including a short but helpful booklet. BUT, there are no extras on the disc. (I will repeat my often lament that with unknown works, there should be some documentary/interviews to flesh it out for the viewer. That is not too expansive an addition.)

If you like opera buffa, and Im a big fan, this is one to see. Is there more of this from Wolf-Ferrari? I have no idea though he did compose a Ceneretola. Id love to see that.",1382745600,,2600,4.886621315192744
8269562,5,B0018D894C,"Ad inizio anno ho avuto il piacere di assistere al teatro di Rovigo ad una rappresentazione de ""Il Campiello"" tratto dall'omonima commedia di Carlo Goldoni, musicata e concertata, a mio parere magistralmente (e sottolineo il magistralmente, splendida anche l'ouverture), da Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari. Lo spettacolo  stato particolarmente gradevole. Il cast vocale era in buona parte lo stesso presente in quella che credo sia l'unica edizione pubblicata su CD, registrata dal vivo a Trieste a met degli anni novanta, purtroppo praticamente introvabile.
Pertanto quando lo scorso giugno ho visto su Amazon l'uscita in DVD di ""La Vedova Scaltra"" ho fatto immediatamente l'ordine, senza alcuna esitazione. Anche in questo caso l'accoppiata Goldoni / Wolf-Ferrari si rivela eccellente (magari ne ""Il Campielo"" la musica  pi bella).
Il punto di riferimento, insuperato, di questi lavori penso possa essere il ""Falstaff"" nel quale il Maestro Verdi traccia una nuova direzione nel suo teatro-musicale. Anche qui Wolf-Ferrari rivalorizza la componente teatrale e su questa concerta magistralmente le voci e l'orchestra al punto che Goldoni non mi  mai risultato, in  entrambi i casi, altrettanto godibile come in queste due opere. (Spesso a teatro con Goldoni mi sono annoiato trovandolo prolisso nell'azione in corso e sempre ovvio nei finali).
Il cast  bravo, ben diretto ed a suo agio nel ""fingere come naturale"" il recitar-cantando. Una menzione per Riccardo Zanellato che in questo DVD ""buca il video"" pi di quanto a teatro, seppure in ruoli differenti da questo, abbia a mio vedere ""bucato la scena"".",1223424000,6,1593,5.485714285714286
8269563,5,B0018D894C,I had never heard of the opera before  -  it's very charming.  The production is excellent (if somewhat low-scale).  A very pleasing discovery.,1218931200,9,143,5.086956521739131
