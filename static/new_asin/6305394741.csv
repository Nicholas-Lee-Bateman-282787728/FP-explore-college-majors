7890537,3,6305394741,"A interesting sacred programme: Pergolesi's Stabat Mater coupled with Mozart's Coronation Mass. The interpreters are four very good soloists (only the two ladies in Pergolesi); a regular orchestra (with some troubles, like violins out of tune); and an irregular choir, alternating bad and good moments (e.g.: bad in Kyrie, good in Gloria). Also, there's a notorious predominance of female voices.
Well, you can find reasons to buy this one: first of all, the music - although these two works deserves better interpretations, here we can listen some pleasant moments. Isn't a first class perfomance (like in Messiah's DVD with Cleobury, or The Creation's DVD with Schreier), but an accetable one. Other reasons are a good work from a young conductor, the quality of soloists, good sound and images (a beautiful church in Paris), and the director's work.
So, if we don't have a definitive version of this couple, let's enjoy this one (two curiousities: mistakes at subtitles informing the dates of the death of both composers, and there is interventions of woman's choir at some parts of Stabat).",1008633600,6,1094,5.151685393258427
