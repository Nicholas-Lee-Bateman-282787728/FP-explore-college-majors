5463571,3,B00AP2DDQ6,"Having seen and purchased separately ""The Nanny Express"" and ""Soldier's Love Story"", I decided to purchase the 4 pak because
""Expecting A Miracle"" wasn't available as a separate DVD, and a trailer on ""Nanny"" showed it had Cheech Marin in it, and it looked
good.  But unfortunately, I found ""Miracle"" to be less than miraculous.  The ending was not what I expected, which is okay in principle, but in this case, corny and less deep.  I have yet to watch ""Miles"", as these sports stories made into inspirational films
always annoy me, when they suggest that faith somehow elevates one team to perform better and win because of it.  CORNY!!
None of these can compare to The Kendrick Brother's films.  Oh, by the way, I am Agnostic, but have found many so called inspirational films to be very good.  Despite their preachiness, ""Fireproof"" and ""Courageous"" were powerful.",1388707200,,867,4.863945578231292
