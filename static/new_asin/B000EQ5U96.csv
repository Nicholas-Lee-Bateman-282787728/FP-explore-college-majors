8353463,5,B000EQ5U96,"Hip Hop Street Credentials covers hip hop from the perspective of innovative within the subversive and progressive world of the genre. It gives their take on what's wrong with hip hop music today, and what they are doing to take it back to what it's supposed to be.

What makes this so interesting is how different all of these artists are. Today, rap is shown mainly from the BLING angle, here we see an acclaimed poet (Saul Williams), a underground star (Aesop Rock), an eccentric icon (Kool Keith), an ex-hustler-turned role model (Pee Wee Kirkland), a battle rapper (Poison Pen), a street mix-tape DJ (Silva Sirfa) and a revolutionary (Immortal Technique). All of these subjects have different attitudes about their roles within the artform, yet all seem to find similar problems in the genre.

Besides the documentary, the DVD also contains over 2 hours of unedited interviews and a few other intriguing features such as the director's (Israel "" IZ-REAL "" Vasquetelle) visit to a juvenile detention center. In this gritty segment, he speaks to youths about, ironically, the dangers and perils in buying into the hip hop depicted in video games, videos and on mainstream radio.

A worthy choice for anyone wanting to learn more about this fascinating culture, or for anyone who's fed up with the misogynistic, excessive, and misguiding turn hip hop has take since it's golden era. Give it an A+",1146528000,4,1398,4.940425531914894
