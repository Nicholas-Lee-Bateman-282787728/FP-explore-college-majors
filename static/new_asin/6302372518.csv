The whole show is a joy to watch. Recommended, A++. I don't think it is available on dvd.",1216598400,,266,4.34
456000,5,6302372518,"Man, I've been waiting for a DVD of Concert In The Park to be released since DVDs first hit the market...I can't understand why it hasn't happened. There are some Paul Simon shows out there on DVD that are much more obscure than Concert In The Park. Not to mention the fact that this show from August 15th, 1991, is THE best filmed concert of Simon's career. I bought the VHS tape the day it was released (and still have it in great condition...lucky me, seeing what it goes for now!) It really makes no sense that this show hasn't (yet) been released on DVD. Maybe we'll get a 20th Anniversary Edition (In three-and-a-half years) with extra footage...I watched this show the day it was broadcast live on HBO, the evening before the first day of 6th grade...preceding the concert was a documentary-type program, chronicling Simon's career and giving a look into the making of what was, at the time, his latest album, The Rhythm Of The Saints. I am 27 now, and a musician because of this show. A week after the live broadcast, I was taking drum lessons. This concert MUST be put out on DVD. One of the best shows EVER.",1198368000,4,1117,4.480392156862745
456001,5,6302372518,"This concert, from 1991--not 1981--is my favorite of all the videos, CDs, etc, I have of Paul's music. Paul obviously pulled together a group of people who knew what they were doing. Everything--from the band--with Michael Brecker on sax and ewi, Steve Gadd on drums, S. African bassist Ray Phiri, vocalists Julia, Maxine and Oren Waters, Chris Botti on trumpet--was perfect. The camera work was perfect. The sound was perfect. The lighting effects were perfect.
The song order, from uptempo to slower tunes and back again was just right. Paul's voice is the best I've ever heard--either before this time or since. And, he took great care in making sure he looked good as well, a big plus, since the camera is obviously on him more than anyone else. Paul is full of energy on this video, he doesn't just stand in front of the mic, which is nice to see. The band is really tight and there is a great rapport between everyone.  It is quite a sight to see Central Park and all the skyscrapers right before sunset and then after dark.  The music along with the great camera shots of the audience and the buildings made me feel I was right there in the Park enjoying the show.
The only critism I have of this is that the crowd was too noisy and was so at many inappropriate times. But, people sometimes don't have sense to know better.
If you are a fan of Paul Simon and have never bought this, GET IT! If you are looking for a great evening of music, this video will fill about 3 hours and is worth every penny!",993600000,7,1507,4.41726618705036

7824839,5,6302372518,"This concert I have had on VHS for years, and have the audio CDs as well. It is simply an outstanding concert, Simon in great form. For such a brilliant concert to not have made it to DVD is just such a head scratcher. Inferior concerts have made the cut, and if the A/V is not up to scratch obviously it would be shown up in Blu ray- But such a quality concert, people can forgive a slight slack in visual, the sound is still great.
The bottom line, like many obscure deleted items, demand is there and if they don't cash in, bootleggers will! This is screaming for a release before DVD copies and the like make their Ebay appearances!",1359158400,,636,4.264462809917355
7824840,2,6302372518,"I rate this a 2 star, not because the video or concert is not good, but it's time to put this down to a Bluray version!! Concert in the Park is to me one of the best Paul Simon live performance. So come on, get the Bluray version out soon.",1338681600,,239,3.8
7824841,5,6302372518,"Hard to figure how this hasn't made it's way to DVD or better yet Blu-ray.  A huge band of fantastic players easily handle the entire Paul Simon catalogue.  The live version of ""Diamonds"" is worth the purchase price alone.",1320796800,,222,4.666666666666667
7824842,1,6302372518,"It is 20 years since this video has been released. Since 20 years fans can only buy a VHS tape.
In 2001 we started to ask for a DVD
In 2005 it was obscure that nothing exists
In 2010 Paul Simon said this was the higlight of his career.
2011 - how many people do still have a VHS player? 1 out of 10.000 ?
Still nothing, no DVD, no Blue Ray. Ok, just let the DVD pass and go on to release a Blue-Ray, but PLEASE, do something!

DO NOT BUY",1311465600,12,741,3.8684210526315788
7824843,5,6302372518,"I had seen this before so knew paying 15 times the flea market price was the deal of the century. Finding a good copy of this fantastic video is getting harder to find. This VHS has all the African drummers and South American flavor the CD is missing. With out prejudice- the ""drummers on meth"" section is amazing. I love those guys.",1243382400,,333,4.387096774193548
7824844,4,6302372518,"This is a long concert, almost two hours, but it's an excellent one filled with a lot of very good songs. It's almost a shock this never made it to DVD.

Paul Simon's post-Simon & Garfunkel sound is a little different: a mellow sound but still with a beat. Some songs feature a quiet guitar, some have drums and other percussion instruments you wouldn't normally associate with the old Simon & Garfunkel sound.

For me, the best part of this concert are the first eight songs, most of which I was not familiar with before this concert. The best of those eight, to me, was ""Train In The Distance"" with some wonderful solo guitar work by Vincent Nguini. The latter is just one of many African musicians who back up Simon. In fact, most of the band is from somewhere in Africa. There also is a pretty darn good jazz saxophonist named Michael Brecker. Anyway, with a pro like Simon you're going to get top-flight musicians.

There are 22 songs in this concert and only three I didn't care for but, hey, 19 good songs out of 22 is still a good percentage of winners!",1238803200,,1061,4.430769230769231
