6070223,5,B00GBYPH70,"I was fortunate to see this film at a college screening before its official release in June 2013. Here are my thoughts about the film: Is a looming hot state climate - a hyperthermal event as geologists call it - reason to bring on nuclear energy? According to Stewart Brand, Mark Lynas, and others, the answer is an emphatic Yes. To put it another way: can the Earth shift into a hot state climate at 1,000 ppm CO2 (a kind of 21st century new Eocene Age ) and preserve most of human civilization and the biosphere? The answers to this would have to account for vastly expanded desert regions and a degraded, acidified ocean. It is worth noting that, according to James Hansen, the world would have to phase into a hot state climate before the Venus Syndrome takes hold (there is a YouTube video with Dr. Hansen explaining the Venus Syndrome, or the runaway greenhouse effect).

A hot state climate in which the Earth has lost most or all of its polar ice is a looming threat, and one which more than justifies the build-out of advanced, inherently safe Generation IV nuclear power stations. Considering the high cost and eventual futility of seawalls against a major sea level rise, nuclear energy funded at ten percent (10%) of national government budgets would be a bargain. On top of this, nuclear power provides energy security and even sustainable energy independence for the United States, Europe, Japan, China, and India. Since we just can't ""turn off the lights"" on the electrical grid, we'll have to power it -- reliably, 24-7 -- for decades into the future. That's where the Generation III-plus and Generation IV designs come into play.

The failure of Wind and Solar power is well documented here, as well as the continued advantage of Nuclear.  The film makers might have gone into more of the political basis for W & S subsidies, but I suspect that kind of 'partisanship' is still too sensitive for them.

The fast integral neutron reactor developed by Argonne Laboratories should play an important part in solving the energy problems of this world, but the movie - my only critique- does not provide any details on the experimentation which support the claims that support the  improved safety of the reactor, control of proliferation of atomic weapons, the decrease in volume and half-life of nuclear waste, prolongation of effective use of the limited amounts of uranium in this world.
The story line remains interesting throughout. The discussion on the relative value of different forms of energy should remain science based with quotes and explanations of real data and experiments. Demonstrations of do-gooders hyped up by  'environmentalists' do harm, politicians without enough insight into, grip on energy problems should know better than trying to gain votes and campaign money from oil and fossil fuel millionaires.",1433116800,3,1052,5.447852760736196

I was surprised when the movie revealed that the opposition to the Long Island plant was being funded by the oil industry.  And the death toll at Chernobyl was far less than I had imagined.  Now before you say it was a nuclear plant; well it was.  An unsafe design with absolutely no containment structure.  Only used in the Soviet bloc.

6070293,5,B00GBYPH70,"This was a mind-changer for me. I've always been against nuclear power. But this movie countered my notions with facts that are hard to dispute, including my main concern which is how to deal with the waste.

I tend to trust the film because I am familiar with Mark Lynas - his excellent book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Degrees-Our-Future-on-a-Hotter-Planet/dp/1426203853/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet</a>&nbsp;is what opened my eyes to the seriousness of climate change.

Questions around power generation and the environment tend to be decided by emotion and partisanship, fueled by ignorant journalists. This movie calmly and rationally presents facts. Are they accurate? I don't know. But I am generally informed about the issues discussed and they didn't say anything that contradicts what I've learned in the past. I did, however, learn a lot of specifics from this film.

The example of France is hard to dispute. (And they aren't even using the safer, more modern designs, I believe.) France shows if you do things right (unlike Chernobyl, Fukushima, Three Mike Island) nuclear can be a good solution. I would be scared if places like Zimbabwe or Guatemala went nuclear. And I would hope future plants are not located so close to population centers, to be on the safe side. But first world countries should certainly consider it, if this film is correct. And it's the first world that needs to reduce fossil fuels - we're pumping out most of it.

Even if we used just enough nuclear to eliminate coal, that would be a huge win. Remember, coal has huge disadvantages besides also being so CO2-dirty. The reason you can't eat much tuna, for example, is mercury pollution largely from coal burning.

Is this movie biased or one-sided? Well, it presents a case and argues for it with facts and reason. It's not the type of documentary where they present both sides. This movie's audience is obviously people who are against nuclear power who already know the anti-nuclear arguments. So it doesn't go into those.

Is nuclear power too expensive? I don't know. But I know climate change is going to be expensive. And if nuclear ends up costing more per kilowatt, I would like that. The main reason Americans waste so much energy is that it is too cheap, when you take into account the hidden environmental costs.

At the very least, I hope this film starts a discussion. We are on track to climate change disaster. Coal use is accelerating. Carbon output is accelerating. Energy use is accelerating. All trends in the wrong direction. We have to face reality. We need practical solutions, not idealistic ones. I would prefer that we could *entirely* use clean and renewable sources and that people would use less energy. But this does not appear realistic.",1408320000,8,2850,5.129310344827586
6070304,5,B00GBYPH70,Absolutely amazing. Thorough and well researched. Speaks the truth that only nuclear energy alone has the potential to save the earth.,1408233600,3,134,5.428571428571429
6070305,4,B00GBYPH70,"This is bound to be a controversial documentary.  Copyright 2013, this film argues the case for more nuclear electricity generation plants.  Bear in mind, this was filmed AFTER the meltdowns at Fukushima Daiichi.  I thought, ""this has a very high bar to convince me more nuclear plants are a good idea.""  Much of the narration is by some self-described environmentalists who came around to the conclusion that nuclear power plants had to be part of a plan to reduce world production of carbon dioxide and curb increasing global warming.  But can it be safe?  Safety concerns generally run to three: what to do with the spent fuel rods, how to avoid a meltdown such as Chernobyl or Fukushima Daiichi, and terrorist attacks intent on stealing or simply dispersing radioactive materials.  This film I thought fairly convincingly dealt with the first two issues, though not the third.
Along the way, it discusses the confusing terminology used to measure radiation levels, the large variation in background environmental radiation, people currently living near the Chernobyl plant and the Fukushima plants, and France's decision after the Arab Oil Embargo which quadrupled oil prices and caused a sharp worldwide recession, that it was a national security priority to develop nuclear energy generation.  In France, 80% of the electricity comes from nuclear power plants.  They have a very simple, but apparently quite functional storage facility for used fuel rods.  To show how large the CO2 problem is: the film states that average CO2 production per person in France is about 5 tons per year, while in Germany next-door, which generates much less electricity from nuclear plants, the average is 10 tons per person-year.  Even 5 tons per person per year is a lot.

It's unfortunate the film didn't devote more time to the discussion of ""fourth generation"" nuclear power plant designs.  It discussed just one of them with a modicum of detail, the ""IFR"", developed at Argonne National Laboratory, tested under extreme fault conditions and found to be safe from meltdown...and then the project was mothballed as politically too difficult (just as plans for a long-term storage facility in the US have been).  The film then quickly mentions there are three other good fourth-generation designs, all of which have several advantages over currently-operating nuclear plants, but seemed to run out of time (or experts?) to discuss the other designs.

As someone with older ears, I always appreciate subtitles.  Many documentaries don't have them.  This does not, but the speaking is clearly articulated without much background noise, and subtitles weren't important unless you have really substantial hearing loss.

There are 3 ""bonus features"" on the DVD (in addition to the ubiquitous director's commentary track) none of them very long (between about 9 and 30 minutes).  The second is the most useful-an interview with a nuclear engineer discussing in a little more detail why nuclear power plants will probably be essential, and the large differences between third-generation (the best ones currently operating) and fourth generation designs, in both efficiency and safety.

Anyone interested in the alternatives to fossil fuel consumption should, I think, watch this documentary if you don't want to spend a great deal more time reading books on the subject.  I found it very insightful.",1406937600,2,3383,5.2393320964749535
6070306,1,B00GBYPH70,"It is pro nuke fantasy. In a perfect world, these reactors don't fail. In reality they do fail ( Chernobyl, Fukishima, Three Mile Island) and contaminate the planet. The alternative reactors were glossed over. The fact that we make weapons from the spent fuel is a key to why we will not change the system. This movie is pure propaganda.",1401753600,4,337,4.633333333333334
6070307,1,B00GBYPH70,"The film suggests that if the world can commit to the construction of a fleet of expensive nuclear power plants (like France) and build the ""almost"" accident-proof waste-eating IFR reactor (which was canceled in 1992, they suggest solely because of politics), we can save the Earth from global warming. If we would share this technology around the world, everyone will decide not to build any weapons, cover-up anything, and carefully manage the waste. While we currently have tons of this lethal radioactive stuff scattered across the globe, it isn't actually very dangerous *cough* and can be stored in pools and outside in dry caskets for x amount of time. What's wrong with just keeping them there? What could possibility go wrong?

Seriously?

One surreal segment includes them holding a meter into the air at Chernobyl, which they do not mention is polluted very unevenly, and suggesting that the Chernobyl accident was not that bad and a great place to live. They show a small town thriving in Chernobyl. Now, if the directors built a log cabin with trees in the Red Forest, grew plants off the ground, and feed it to their children, I would be impressed. But holding a meter in the air and at few select locations that avoided the worst fallout? Who do you think you're kidding?

While I think future nuclear research is very important, I don't think it can play that big of a role in climate change. Everyone knows the benefits of nuclear power, but we cannot use it because the of two biggest problems, waste and weapons. The film does not adequately address these issues, which leads me to believe it is because there is truly no solution. Renewables are gaining and we should give it a chance.",1401580800,3,1705,4.772881355932204

The film contains interviews with many environmental activists that once campaigned against nuclear power but have switched sides.  Pro- nuclear power Greens give their reasons for switching to support atomic power rather than fighting nuclear reactors.  The orthodoxies of the Anti-Nuke Greens get an airing in the film too.  I saw an early preview of this film last year at the Thorium Energy Alliance Conference in Chicago.  It got a standing ovation as the curtain closed.

6070311,5,B00GBYPH70,"This documentary examines the history behind nuclear power, and how it is that the USA has come to the point where our old prejudices are being reexamined. The protagonists in the film are all environmentalists who have changed their minds on nuclear. To be precise, their minds have not changed on second generation nuclear, which they all consider problematic and potentially dangerous, but on the designs which were intended from the beginning to replace second generation plants.....the breeder type reactors.

Their point is that the new generation nuclear plants are designed to make such accidents as TMI, Fukushima, and Chernobyl impossible at the level of the physics. These 4th generation IFRs...Integrated Fast Reactors...were first built and tested in 1987, at Argonne National Laboratory, in Idaho. For laymen like myself, the film makers demonstrate that, when electric and pumped coolant, in the case of the IFR, sodium, is turned off...the reactors heat up at first, but then shut themselves down, without operator intervention. Add to this, that the waste the IFRs produce is mostly recycled as fuel...and the film makers make clear that this option is clean, safe, renewable, and sustainable....to a degree that the public remains largely oblivious.

The film develops an important thesis on sustainability, proposing that there is no way that green technologies  of hydro, solar, wind, geo-thermal, and whatever...will ever alone, be able to meet the world's massive and increasing demand for energy. Connected to the grid as they must, popular renewables  require backup when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. That backup is another fossil fuel..usually natural gas. To return the planet to the relative safety of 350 ppm carbon dioxide, the case the protagonists present for 4th generation nuclear is rational and scientifically based, not upon theory, but upon real world reactors which have already been built and tested.

The viewer will come to their own conclusions, but I found the presentation to be convincing. I can recommend it for anyone interested in climate change and effective carbon dioxide free responses, to what will turn out to be the biggest anthropogenic natural challenge ever faced by humanity.",1397952000,3,2254,5.338028169014085
6070312,4,B00GBYPH70,"This is about as good a presentation of the most credible pro-nuke position as I've seen, and it's an up-to-date perspective. It shoots down a lot of the more ridiculous anti-nuke claims; this is very easy to do, and it seemed to be done fairly. It was particularly amusing to see Helen Caldicott get just enough rope, with which she well and properly hanged herself.

That said, I'm still not buying the nuclear renaissance. Fukushima showed that Murphy's Law has certainly not been repealed (although it still wasn't nearly as bad as some of the more ridiculous claims of the death-of-the-Pacific-Ocean nutjobs). Fukushima can't be simply dismissed as Chernobyl, as just a symptom of a collapsing system. One of the participants in the film said as much, and said it well.

The major part of the picture that Pandora's promise is deafeningly silent on is economics. If you want to generate most the world's electricity by nukes, as in France, how much is it going to cost to build all those plants, and later take care of the waste and decommissioning? Unlike wind and solar, nukes don't easily lend themselves to cost reduction, and they cannot easily be built quickly and in small units to match shifting demand. They also don't say anything quantitative about the economics of the competitors (basically, again wind and solar, and a bit from a few other things such as geothermal). I was about to say that this would've made the film more convincing. But maybe it wouldn't; that, in fact, is the problem.",1396656000,9,1509,4.822393822393822

After doing so, I found it to be very informative and I learned much more about nuclear energy than I have seen anywhere else. I have to believe that the reviewer who labeled it simply as a mess, could in fact be someone who is so against nuclear energy that they feel others should not see opposing viewpoints.

I thought it was very well compiled and the information and its accompanying documentation flowed smoothly. Yes, it may have a few segments that depicted some who disagree with the nuclear energy as being uninformed but, after watching the film, I tend to agree that they may just be uninformed and are against it solely because of agenda driven beliefs.

It was interesting to see how some who were adamantly against this form of energy in the past, which includes a number of experts in that field, have changed their minds and are now in favor of it after researching the data.

I was also not aware of the different types of reactors and, how corners were cut to save money in just about every location where accidents have occurred with the remaining, being due to human error in that safety fail-safes were ignored that could have prevented the accident, as was the case in Three Mile Island.

6070328,4,B00GBYPH70,"This is a very well-made documentary, directed by Robert Stone, whose feature documentaries have focused on a range of issues such as American history, pop-culture, and the environment. Pandora's promise focuses on Nuclear Energy, and aims to show that in the context of climate change nuclear power is indispensable. The film focuses on several prominent environmentalists (such as Stewart Brand, who was also a major voice in Stone's previous film Earth Days) who have changed their mind about nuclear power and now see it as an essential part of the solution to reducing carbon emissions while meeting global energy needs. While the film does address some of the concerns about nuclear power that have troubled environmentalists, it remains largely an advocacy film, suggesting that the benefits of nuclear power outweigh the costs, at least when compared with traditional power sources such as natural gas, petroleum and coal. There is a tendency in the film to brush aside the potential for disasters, such as the still uncontained disaster at Fukushima, with the claim that those are the result of outdated technologies and are now preventable. I wish that the filmmakers had given a greater voice to such concerns.",1392163200,4,1221,5.2030456852791875
6070329,5,B00GBYPH70,"Every once in while, a motion picture comes along that can change long-entrenched views and make a real difference.  On nuclear power, this one is it.

For most of my life, I was ambivalent (or worse) on nuclear energy.  Having grown up in the Cold War era, it always seemed uncertain and scary and, after all, what do you do with the waste?

Besides, we already decided in the 1980's that we didn't need nuclear anymore.  Surely we can solve our problems and environmental challenges with more conventional approaches, right?

This documentary takes a no-holds-barred approach to mythbusting and sensationalism...  Just because hanging onto a stance is popular, or because something sells the most newspapers, doesn't make it right.  Taking a look at the actual numbers and data and where we are now, and think differently.

Do like many others are doing in film festivals around the world: Set your fears aside for 90 minutes and see this movie.  It could be one of the most important you ever watch.",1391299200,3,1002,4.841176470588235

This movie summarizes how nuclear power became the industry it is today, what it is now, and what it might be in the future. It makes some excellent points as to the true effects of nuclear power (the majority of them beneficial). While the purpose of the documentary is environmental, it would have been nice to discuss economics a little bit more (perhaps nuclear's biggest issue).",1391040000,7,512,5.023529411764706

It then dives into the actual, non-political science behind nuclear power's past, failures, and present.  It is done in a non-threatening manner that is interesting compelling.

It is difficult to be bombarded with so much China Syndrome and bomb history followed by power plant accidents before the real disaster of climate change caused by human burning of fossil fuel becomes such an opportunity for France to become the quick builder of nuclear power plants to switch from burning oil in the twentieth century embargo created by Middle East warfare. The United States had an expensive program to design nuclear reactors that would not melt down if all cooling stopped. That idea was not funded long before Japan in March 2011 had tsunami damage spread some radiation. It takes so long for most people to get cancer, many measurements of radiation levels in this documentary show poor people surviving in the midst of extreme electromagnetic exposures.

Doctors have been using X-rays to locate bone fractures for so long, it seems like the kind of medical meddling protected by The Iron Heel described in a novel by Jack London about the kind of society that produces triple cop snitch corruption immunity like the Billy Bathgate novel by Doctorow. Picturing a globe with coal being the fuel growing the most rapidly as more than seven billion people want a better life before going down in a flood of sludge, the tiny amount of fuel we can get from old Russian missile warheads seems like a godsend from the old Latin ciculus vitiosus deus Nietzsche wrote in Beyond Good and Evil section 56.",1532131200,,1546,4.81203007518797

I can now see that many things I was taught were exaggerated or delivered out of context. Sometimes hearts are in the right place, but the ends do not justify the means when the means spread information that is untrue. It is a shame the breeder reactor program was shut down.

The one thing that I felt was glossed over was the short term risk with Gen II nuclear reactors in use. The filmmakers looked almost exclusively at past history, which set's us up for a Black Swan in terms of risk management. I agree that nuclear promises great things, but an event like an HEMP could turn existing Gen II reactors into huge mistake in hindsight ... hundreds of Fukushima's all at once when we have no resources to fix them. The outcome would differ greatly from the 'historical record.' Then we would wish we had made the breeder program higher priority.",1517961600,,968,4.563218390804598

 ""Environmentalist"" is not a credential, and the environmentalists in this video are heavy on the ""feels"" and light on the science of nuclear power and national security. There isn't any reference to the Cold War or the evils of Communism which would have taken the world nuclear with the US or not.  Perhaps because the people interviewed for this move are sympathetic to Communism? You'll hear about countries and their ""quality of life"" in relation to the nation's energy sources, but not once is quality of life tied to capitalism and the abundance of energy that is made possible via capitalism.

Notice how in each segment they cover a fact or two, then go into their nightmares, their imagination, or refer to phony propaganda like The China Syndrome. Listen for fear words like ""destabilization"" and ""chaos.""
