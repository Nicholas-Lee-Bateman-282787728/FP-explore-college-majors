5821144,5,B00DJYK1XU,"It has taken over seven years but FINALLY we fans are getting what we've been pining for since 2006 when Warner Bros. released the first 13-episode season of MAMA on DVD. Unfortunately, many fans (rightfully) cried foul when it was revealed that syndicated cuts of those shows were all we'd be getting. And so, without the complete episodes on-hand for release (rumour has it there were legal entanglement issues about ownership with the Joe Hamilton estate regarding those full-length episodes), the series was abandoned.

SUMMER 2013: Star-Vista Entertainment (formerly Time-Life) has acquired all six seasons of MAMA on the heels of their successful CAROL BURNETT SHOW releases and have already been taking pre-orders for several months now for MAMA'S FAMILY: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION. Die-hard fans of this hilarious old-fashioned '80s comedy classic couldn't click that pre-order button fast enough--even with the extravagant $200 price tag. But for those on a budget, here it is, the fantastic sophomore season that originally aired on NBC during the 1983-84 TV season.

Unlike the 2006 botched Season One release, this set will indeed include those amusing, pompous introductions by 'your host' Alistair Quince (Harvey Korman) which haven't been seen in 30 years since the show aired in prime time. It's a little thing but means so much to Classic TV fans like myself.

Among the 22 episodes on this set are some of the series funniest, most memorable installments such as RASHOMAMA (the gooseberry jam episode), THE FLAMING FORTIES (Mama, Aunt Fran and Naomi lip-synch to the Andrews Sisters), MAMA BUYS A CAR, BLACK BELT MAMA and THE MAMA WHO CAME TO DINNER. Many belly laughs to be had in these shows and many others. The fabulous Carol Burnett and Betty White make their last regular appearances in this season (White appears in only one Season Three show before fully immersing herself in THE GOLDEN GIRLS) and that too makes it a must-have for Eunice and Ellen lovers.

If you love this show, I'd recommend ordering the COMPLETE COLLECTION instead of this, but for those who want a less-expensive option or didn't really care for the Iola and Bubba characters (and how you could you NOT??) this is the set for you.

As a Bonus Feature, you also get the 90-minute TV special EUNICE that ran on CBS in March of 1982 which grabbed such big ratings, it prompted the producers to throw this series together in the first place!

FIVE STARS and one of the best seasons of MAMA'S FAMILY.",1376179200,40,2491,4.961630695443645

5821210,5,B00DJYK1XU,"""Mama's Family"": Season 2 is chop full of memorable and hilarious episodes. My favorites include: ""Rashomama"", ""Obscene Call"", ""Mama Learns to Drive"", ""Black Belt Mama"", ""Super Market"", ""No Room at the Inn"", and ""A Great Mistake"". Vicki Lawrence is a genius! Her comedic timing is flawless. I adore her. This is the last season with Aunt Fran, Buzz and Sonia. This show was canceled after this season ended but 2 years later, ""Mama's Family"" was reborn and revamped (adding Bubba and Iola to the cast) and became a huge hit in syndication. Season 2 is awesome and underrated. I highly recommend it. ""Mama's Family"" was one of my favorite shows to watch when I was a kid. Brings back wonderful memories for me. So glad every season is available to own on DVD. Enjoy!",1451260800,3,765,4.7164179104477615

5821282,5,B00DJYK1XU,"More of the same that I just mentioned for Season 1...More fun, more quips, more good humor from Vicki Lawrence as Mama and Ken Berry, Betty White, Rue McClanahan, and Dorothy Lyman.  I forgot to mention in my other review that Carol Burnett and Harvey Korman made appearances in Season 1, and can't remember if they did in Season 2. Harvey helped produce Mama's Family and I think he directed some of the episodes. Vicki Lawrence explains in detail how Harvey Korman really helped her nail down the character of Mama when it came to this sitcom. She was just used to doing skits every so often on Carol Burnett show and never had fleshed out the character so to speak. If you ever loved the show Mama's Family even these early shows or episodes were great! Just fun family entertainment that everyone can watch. I'm sure everyone can compare one of their family members to a family member on Mama's Family!",1419897600,,907,4.598765432098766

Mama always spoke her mind and she hardly ever held her tounge. Season 2 is definitely a must own, along with the other seasons. It is the last season with Vints children who are replaced in Season three by Bubba, Eunice's son and Iola, the old girl next door who never left her mother's home. The whole collection is amazing whether you're a fan or not. It also includes the tv movie Eunice that aired before the first season of the show.

5821324,5,B00DJYK1XU,"Mama's Family has been notorious for a good laugh, now 7 years after Warner Home Video released the Lorimar-Telepictures syndicated cuts the original Joe Hamilton network masters appear on DVD.

IMO, the best episode of this season has to be ""Harper vs. Harper"". It was funny to see Mama and Naomi in court suing each other.

The bonus content was great too.

A teleplay called ""Eunice"" which focused on Eunice Higgins, Phil Harper, Ellen Jackson and Thelma""Mama""Harper.
All played by their respective actors except Ken Berry assumes the role of Phillip. The movie is split into four acts, act one focuses on Eunice, act two focuses on Phillip in New York and Eunice's desire to go with him. Act three focuses on Eunice and Mama. The fourth and final act focuses on Mama's funeral and Eunice seeing herself as a failure.

I particularly loved the acting of Ken Berry especiallyin the final act when Eunice and Phil get into a heated argument.

No doubt Eunice would receive a PG-13 for Thematic Material.

The rest of the bonuses were fabulous, especially Vicki Lawrence interviewing Mama.

Take my advice season two is a must have on DVD.",1410652800,,1139,4.81025641025641

I grew up loving this show and probably saw every episode at least three times back when it was airing on TBS years ago.  Of course I finally decided to buy Season 1 that was released way back in '06 by WB about 2 months before the complete series was announced (just my luck)!  Well I was really appreciative that Star Vista included the made for TV movie Eunice on this release instead of on Season 1 so those of us that already had Season 1 could still get that.  I decided to buy the individual releases because I already had Season 1 and it was much cheaper than buying the Complete Series box set.  My only complaint is that the song ""Harper Days"" was omitted on the Mamma For Mayor episodes.

5821376,4,B00DJYK1XU,"I am 33 and just watching this series for the first time, thanks to my mother introducing it to me recently. Although the show is set several decades ago, I find the comedy and the storylines are timeless! Thelma Harper (Vicki Lawrence) could be the matriarch of anyone's family, ruling her roost with smart comments and bizarre anecdotes. Meanwhile, she has quite the family to contend with -- opinionated never-married sister Fran (Rue McClanahan); her hapless son Vint (Ken Berry), who moves into the house with his teenagers Buzz and Sonja after his wife leaves him and he is evicted from his own house; daughters Ellen (Betty White) and Eunice (Carol Burnett); and now new daughter-in-law Naomi (Dorothy Lyman) whose marriage to Vint is her third.

Although each episode is full of laughs, particularly memorable ones in Season 2 include ""Country Club,"" when the entire clan decides to help celebrate Ellen's election as Woman of the Year, much to her humiliation; ""Rashomama,"" when Thelma is hit in the head with a stew pot and Naomi, Ellen and Eunice all have wildly different versions as to what happened; and ""Mama Learns to Drive,"" which is met with the expected results.

I would say it is like""Mama's Family""  from a parallel universe.  I still loved it,  but it had almost no slap-stick and was quite tragic.

5821487,5,B00DJYK1XU,"The second season of the DVD features legendary stars like Vicki Lawrence (Mama Harper), Carol Burnett (Eunice), and Betty White (Ellen) in interviews. The first season only lasted 13 episodes.

It was the second season that displayed Mama's foray into politics as Mayor of Raytown in a two part episode. There were plenty of other memorable episodes in this season including the family on ""Family Feud"" with the late Richard Dawson. There was the dance at the school where Mama and Aunt Fran became the Andrews Sisters.

Sure Mama's Family wasn't first rate in quality but it was sure memorable. This series showed that families aren't perfect nor will they ever be. The first two seasons were my favorite because they included Rue McClanahan, Betty White, Harvey Korman, and Carol Burnett.

Ironically the series was canceled after this season. McClanahan and White would go on to do ""The Golden Girls"" and win Emmys for it. But I have to be honest that I preferred them as Aunt Fran and Rose on Mama's Family. The extra special features especially ""Eunice"" was my favorite. ""Eunice"" was performed like a play on stage with Lawrence, Burnett, Korman, Berry and White. ""Eunice"" was quite sympathetic towards ornery Eunice.

This was the best season of ""Mama's Family"" especially with the cast. I loved watching the special features and the episodes are restored with Harvey Korman as Alistair Quince ala Sir Alistair Cooke in his introductions to most of the episodes.",1384905600,,1469,4.983673469387755

5821532,5,B00DJYK1XU,"I love watching Vicki Lawrence play Thelma Harper.  I've been a fan of this character since the Carol Burnett days.  You also get other great characters like Aunt Fran, Vint and Naomi.  Sometimes daughters Ellen and Eunice show up, just adding to the fun.  You can't go wrong with this set of shows, which are entertaining and always fun to watch, especially the show where Thelma gets hit in the head by a pot that she uses to make her famous gooseberry jam, leaving her with amnesia, and her daughters Eunice and Ellen plus daughter-in-law Naomi all have different stories explaining to Vint just how it happened.  I've been waiting a long time for this second set of ""Mama's Family"" shows and they were worth the wait.  My only complaints are Harvey Korman's little intro scenes at the beginning of each show, which are boring and not very funny, and the ""new house"" shown when the show comes on:  it sure isn't the nice, large house Thelma had the First Season.  Oh, well.  Those are minor complaints.  I just use my remote to fast forward past Harvey's little intro scenes.",1382227200,,1078,4.626315789473685

1. Whoever transferred this show to dvd, fell asleep at the switch. Meaning, they set the levels from the original tape source and left the room

Video levels and pedestal levels are too high and were ""clipped""...meaning, you will see no contrast in the picture, it looks washed out, has very high video levels, and there is NO WAY to adjust for it.

Thanks loads to the high school grad-u-ATE they hired to do the transfer !

2. Whoever suggested piling each disc on top of each other, saved 5 cents a package, and probably got a promotion for it, there at WARNER ARCHIVE !

I MEAN they went cheap on the disc package holder, and now each customer has to come up with their own solution to it !

Vicky is perfect in her part but the others,especially the 20+ yr. olds trying to play teenagers, never blossomed into their characters. Betty White pulled off her role admirably, but Rue McClanahan was never given a chance to showcase her comedic talent. The scripts seemed to be marginally funny so it must be bad casting that caused this show to muddle along (and don't even get me started on the insufferable Bubba,another 25+ yr. old masquerading as a 16 yr. old).  I don't know how many seasons exist for this show, but if any more are released I will wait until the final seasons to make any more purchases when the PERFECT cast is present.",1380672000,,731,4.7109375

5821570,5,B00DJYK1XU,"Season 2 special features:
-The original TV movie Eunice.
-Featurette: Mama's Family Tree: The Roots (all about Mama and Fran)
-Interviews: Vicki Lawrence interviews Mama; Vicki Lawrence and Carol Burnett; Bette White.

Mama's Family is one of those shows that never gets stale. You can watch the episodes over and over and it always manages to entertain. It's a timeless show that has a cartoonish appeal by way of the costumes and production design. The characters are animated and at times exaggerated yet still grounded in truth and the dysfunction is there that people will relate to. Although Raytown is a fantasyland with names like, Ray Mart, McRay's, Ray Lanes, etc. it is reminiscent of middle America. Here we have a group of seasoned professionals, Vicki Lawrence, Betty White, Ken Berry, Dorothy Lyman, Rue McClanahan and Carol Burnett. All these people have a natural gift for comedy. You don't see much of that anymore. This show is just as funny as it was 30 years ago.

Highlights from Season 2 of Mama's Family include Country Club where highfalutin Ellen (Betty White) has been nominated as Raytown's woman of the year. Little does she know that Vint (Ken Berry), Naomi (Dorothy Lyman) and Mama (Vicki Lawrence) will be crashing the grand event. Anyone who has ever had an embarrassing family member (or family) will appreciate this. Rashomama (Carol Burnett's last appearance) begins in the hospital after Mama has been hit in the head with a big cooking pot. Naomi, Ellen and Eunice (Carol Burnett) each tell their own version to Vint about what really happened so we have a series of hilarious and contradicting flashbacks. Ellen's Boyfriend features Betty White dating a much younger man much to Mama's dismay. The Mama Who Came to Dinner has Vint and Naomi throwing a party for their close friends but Mama ends up throwing her back out and being the center of entertainment.

In Mama Learns to Drive, Mama wants a hat that is on sale at the department store but no one wants to take her to get it so she is forced to finally learn how to drive for herself. Supermarket lands Mama a job at the Food Circus working with Naomi which does not go over so well with the family. Mama crashes Vint and Naomi's anniversary honeymoon in No Room at the Inn and ends up spending the night with them. A broken vacuum cleaner and a burnt rug bring Mama and Naomi to court in Harper vs. Harper. Finally, in Mama's Birthday, we get to see Mama on her 30th birthday with a younger Ellen, Eunice and Vint. Tanya Fenmore as little Eunice definitely steals the show here.

This show got better after Betty White and Rue McClanahan went on to do The Golden Girls and Beverly Archer was brought in as the prissy next door neighbor Iola and Allan Kayser as Eunice's delinquent son Bubba. Still, there are many episodes to savor in Season 2. Season 3-6 was when the show went into first run syndication where it remained number one the entire four years. The first two seasons were funny, but at times it became too serious and dramatic. After the show was revamped, it became more silly and lighthearted and was a ratings success. You can order the entire series with a bevy of special features included through the Time Life website.",1379635200,15,3236,4.712014134275618
5821571,5,B00DJYK1XU,I'm so happy to receive this DVD yesterday. I was waiting for it for a long time. I do recommend this wonderful television series. I do miss MAMA HARPER!,1379548800,3,153,4.310344827586207
5821582,5,B00DJYK1XU,"The second season of Mama's Family gets even better as Vicki Lawrence pulls out all the stops to make Mama the most hilarious sharp tongued old lady ever on television. When I need a laugh I put her on. Her timing is exquisite, and you laugh till you hurt. I saw Vicki Lawrence in person and she is so entertaining.",1379462400,4,315,4.266666666666667
5821583,4,B00DJYK1XU,"After seeing season 2 on cable so often, it's really great to finally have all the episodes unedited - it's amazing how much was chopped out on some of these in order to squeeze in more commercials. I still think those Alistair Quince intros are tedious & unfunny more often than not. It's a true pleasure to have the 1982 made-for-tv flick ""Eunice"" on disc 4 - it's part hilarious/part Tennessee Williams with a lot of screaming. What mars giving dvd 5 stars is the packaging - case has all 4 dvds just stacked on top of each other - no screening protection between them at all, very shoddy & on the cheap if you ask me! I just re-stored them in individual cases - waited decades for season 2 & don't want them getting scratched or goofed up. That quibble aside, season 2 is most definitely worth buying - they're still as hilarious as they were back in 1983/84 & can be rewatched again & again!",1379462400,2,896,4.37125748502994
5821584,5,B00DJYK1XU,THIS SHOW IS ONE OF THE FUNNIEST SERIES THAT I HAVE EVER WATCHED.  READY TO WATCH THIS 2ND SEASON GREAT,1379289600,,103,4.15
5821585,4,B00DJYK1XU,"I love Mama's Family, and I started with Season 2 so I could see the Eunice special and I wasn't disappointed! And since the episodes were mostly uncut there were new things I hadn't seen before since I had only seen TV edits, so I am 99% in love with this set!  My only problem is that in the description it said there was 5 of the original ""Family"" sketches from The Carol Burnett Show was on this, and they're not.  But it does have the Eunice special and some interviews with some of the cast members.  I highly recommend this, just don't count on the 5 sketches being there. ;)",1379030400,7,582,4.225225225225225

5821587,3,B00DJYK1XU,"I was really excited that Star Vista/Time Life released Mama's Family Season two.  They did a great job with the extras, such as the Harvey Korman original NBC intros as Allistar Quince, as well as the closing credits with the characters telling jokes.  However, that being said they fell short on a few episodes by editing them, specifically ""Gert Rides Again"" with Imogene Cocoa they completely cut out the song and dance routine Gert and Mama did to ""Ain't Misbehavin'"" and also in the Mama For Mayor episode they deleted Mama's song ""Harper Days are Here again"".  Very disappointing.  Anything with even a few lyrics to a song was edited out. I guess they didn't want to have to pay for the rights to the songs, but it is a shame to edit out the episodes when they are so well done.  Overall, I am glad they released this season and I plan on buying season one as well, since I prefer the NBC episodes to the syndicated ones.  Luckily , I recorded the episodes with the songs off cable years ago.",1378857600,6,1000,4.467032967032967
5821588,5,B00DJYK1XU,Iv been waiting for this day were it would be released and at my door. I got it this morning I was so happy. I just hope that the 3rd season will soon be released with the rest as fallowed.,1378857600,,189,3.75
5821589,5,B00DJYK1XU,"I am so happy season 2 FINALLY came onto DVD!  The first season was 'ok' but I had to get it because its a classic and was the only thing available.  However like most shows this series did not really pick up until season 2, I can't wait (hoping/fingers crossed) that more seasons will be released! The show is so funny, there aren't a lot of wholesome family fun shows on anymore - my mom got me into this show when I was a little kid and it stuck with me so it brings me back.  Love it and can't wait for more..  thanks!!!!!",1378771200,,526,4.028846153846154
5821590,5,B00DJYK1XU,"I love watching this show for many years. So when season one came out I was excited. And it took forever for them to release season two. And now that they did I am overjoyed. My favorites are Country Club, There is no room in the inn , Ellen's Boyfriend, Mama's buy a car, and many more. I hoping that release season 3 through 6 soon. This is a good clean show they don't make like this anymore.",1378771200,,395,4.076923076923077
5821591,3,B00DJYK1XU,"I anxiously was looking forward to these sets. Mama's Family season 1 and 2. Well, you've guessed it, Folks! There are a total of 6 EDITED episodes in both season 1 and season 2 of the NEWLY released TIME LIFE DVD sets. 2 EDITED from season 1 and 4 edited from season 2. Unless the complete season set contains the unedited version, which would make no sense to me, the TIME LIFE are NOT as originally broadcast. They ARE EDITED!!!!!!!!!
