8459502,5,B0056CUPHK,"Hakuoki was absolutely spectacular!! It only goes by Toshizo Hijikata's story as far as it's relation to the game, but it pulls in pieces frome everyone's routes. The anime is very well put together and the Japanese voice actors were phenominal. The animation looked alot like Vampire Knight's. I reccomend this to any anime fan who likes love stories.
The series will have you crying and laughing all in the same episode!
I give this series a 10 out of 10.",1335139200,4,457,4.654320987654321
8459503,3,B0056CUPHK,"I adore this anime movie.  It does promise all episodes and OVAs.  Only have two small complaints.  Scenes where a character thrusts a weapon into someone is cut out (ok if you don't like gory parts), and the english subs in the OVA's is not accurate.",1330387200,5,251,4.413043478260869
