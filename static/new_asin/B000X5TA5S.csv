2998620,3,B000X5TA5S,The quality of the dvd is quite good considering how old it is but I am not happy that it was not advertised that it didn't come with a cover for the money you pay.  I didn't get any feedback when I queried this either so my review about the seller is not crash hot.,1253750400,,266,3.8363636363636364
2998621,3,B000X5TA5S,"As an historical record of this very important film from 1941, it is worth having, but I think it should be mentioned that this is not re-mastered at all, but a straight copy of an old print of the film, scratchy sound & all. I was disappointed to find that it was a burned disc, not a commercially produced one.
Still, I am glad I have it.",1251504000,,340,4.08955223880597
2998622,3,B000X5TA5S,"A must for WW1 buff's, shows the australian ""she'll be right mate"" attitude that accompanied so many australian diggers through the war.

the footage is recorded from original film and is a little ""jittery"" in the VERY begining but settles down ok, it even has the original ""intermission"" in the middle of DVD.

realistic audio in battle scenes, none of this studio mixed sound effects but actual ""on feild audio"". so much noise its hard to distinguish what and where its comming from, just as it would have REALLY been like on the battle field.

if you like the Australian LIGHT HORSE history then this should be in your movie collection,
just remember this DVD is a direct copy of the original 1941 film, and the audio and visual quality is only as good as it was in 1941.
having said that, i'd recomend it to any one who is interested in the Australian war effort.",1206316800,11,867,4.544871794871795

2998625,5,B000X5TA5S,"What a wonderful old picture.  Brought back memories of my childhood when it was released for general viewing.
What I remember most is the massive sand hills in the Kurnell area of the Sutherland Shire.  Sadly the sand hills are all but gone.  Used to help build thousands of Sydney homes in the post WW11 years.  The area is being subdivided for the building of homes etc. in the near future.
I had the fortune to be in Bersheeba, Israel in recent years for the dedication of a memorial to the men of the Light Horse who led the famous charge against the Turkish lines which enabled thousands of horses to get to water
