8138217,5,B000HC2LUI,I've been using this workout video for years - the instant workout is the best - it's helped me shed 35 lbs so far and I have more to go.  It's my workout go to video,1439596800,2,166,3.611111111111111
8138218,3,B000HC2LUI,"I like this DVD. Yet maybe in the 80's it would have shed the POUNDS!!! If your looking for a very LOW IMPACT excercise tape then this tape is for you. I didn't sweat much so it was a bit of a waste of my time. Kathy does very well with the transistion of the steps and showing you correct form. If you are really looking to shed pounds, maybe try another tape that will actually make you SHED the POUNDS",1328140800,,404,4.0

This DVD contains three workouts previously released on VHS:  Starting Out (1987), Instant Workout (1991) and March to Fitness (1993).  If you're into walking workouts, such as Leslie Sansone, the March to Fitness is right up your alley!

I purchased this DVD mostly for the March to Fitness workout.  it's only 30 minutes.  it has basic moves, marching in place, side to side, salsa moves, forward and back steps.  the set is nice with a window overlooking a pool, garden and blue sky.  There are two women with her working out.

The other 2 workouts - i only previewed them, and they'd be great for someone starting out or if you need a workout with lower intenstiy.",1325116800,7,1364,8.287671232876713
8138220,5,B000HC2LUI,"Note: this dvd is compiled of 3 classic workouts that were formerly in VHS form and have now been re=released as a 3 dvd compilation.

First, I have to say that the ""march to fitness"" dvd on here is worth 5 stars alone. It's one of my most favorite workouts. But you get 3 total dvds in here so the price, I felt, was excellent.

Now granted, you are no doubt gonna laugh a bit when you slide this into the dvd player and are taken back in time to the 1980's with a Farrah Fawcett hairstyle, leg warmers, double socks (ala flashdance) and you'll be amazed that it was ever found ""sexy"" to workout without a sports bra (as you'll witness in the ""starting out"" workout) so that, well, you can guess what you see...which wouldn't be so crazy if there weren't a woman in her 70s on the dvd. But, that was 1980, Farrah had that poster out in the red one piece where she was um, ""chilly"" and the look was copied even in the gym, things have changed...thank God...
...and none of that hindered my workout one bit. But it can't go without mention because you are gonna giggle through some of this.

That said, I'll admit I am not a fan of all of Kathy Smith's workouts but she became famous in the 80s and, to me, this shows evidence as to one of the reasons why. I found her instruction very clear, I got a great workout, and the moves were timeless, in spite of the hair and outfits. (giggle)

March to Fitness was one of those rare dvds that you actually don't WANT to stop. It was truly FUN! This one was from 1993 so it's not such a time wharp feeling to watch it either. The music was from the dance hits of the 60s and 80s (but it's amusing to me that she says ""remember dancing to this one?"" regarding music in the 60s and, unless I danced in my crib, I never did. But again, I think the time warp feeling just makes it amusing) and there were some ""dancing-band-style"" marching moves that were VERY easy to follow along to (and I have two left feet, and no coordination) and offered great caloric burn...

...which brings me to the fact that I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily caloric expenditure. I mention this only because I can see the exact caloric burn a dvd garners by measurement rather than percieved exertion and this was high up there on burning the calories! And, since it was fun, it easily captured the 5 stars for me!

Negatives: yes, I know ""jazzercise"" was hot back then but working out to jazz music in some parts of the dvd wasn't my personal taste although I can't speak for others. We even did ""jazz hands"" moves a few times.

also ""starting out"" was too long, for me, in the warm up and stretching at a low heart rate so the caloric burn during this was minimal. yes, she made up for it in the other dvd segments, but I did wind up fast forwarding as I felt it was ""overkill""

Conclusion: It's a steal for the price and although all 3 workouts offer much, the march to fitness is so easy to follow and so dang much fun, with great music that you will actually recognize rather than the typical non-copywrited instrumental tunes that are typical of today's workout dvds, that it's worth the price alone for the fun and the calorie burn.",1252800000,8,3161,4.265442404006678
8138221,5,B000HC2LUI,"I have to disagree with the one-star review. I've had March to Fitness since it was on VHS and was really glad to get it on DVD with the other workouts. I haven't done the 'Starting Out' workout, but I really like the leg toning segment from 'Instant Workout', it's less than 15 minutes and is a quick little standing routine. 'March to Fitness' is a great walking workout and I don't think it's dated at all. Just a nice 30 minute low impact workout that's easy to follow, one of my favorite Kathy Smith workouts.",1236902400,7,514,4.364583333333333
8138222,1,B000HC2LUI,I purchased this for some variety in my workouts. It was horrible! All three workouts are extremely dated. Kathy and her w/o buddies leave a lot to be desired. They are not in sync and they move like jumpy robots. Spastic is the first word that comes to mind when describing this workout. Kathy is not good at leading or announcing upcoming movements. Don't waste your money on this one.,1234656000,,387,4.542857142857143
8138223,5,B000HC2LUI,This DVD contains three differents programs aerobics and toning. They are short and effective. They keep me with energy the whole day which is important for me and my two years old son.,1178928000,4,185,4.636363636363637

8138225,5,B000HC2LUI,"I'm an 80's workout junkie. I bought this DVD because it has three workouts on it. That's a good deal! I have to admit that I haven't done the first two workouts: Starting Out and Instant Workout. I have watched through them though and they seem to be good, balanced, easy and yet challenging like most of Kathy's workouts. The first workout I tried on this DVD was March To Fitness and I liked it so much that I stuck with it. It's a lot of fun to do! It's a simple walking in place program with dance moves mixed in. It's a great cardio workout; good for burning fat! I really like Kathy as a workout instructor. She's very encouraging.",1170028800,15,638,4.2809917355371905
