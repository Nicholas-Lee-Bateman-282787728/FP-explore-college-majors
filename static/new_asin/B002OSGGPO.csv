8376387,3,B002OSGGPO,"Fun 1940s comedy-mystery from the Henry Aldrich movie series.  Henry is thought to have done away with his high-school principal and he has to find out what has happened. A good part of the proceedings takes place in a haunted house that looks like a warehouse for the Natural History Museum.  I have the Nostalgia Merchant DVD-R release.  The quality is not great. The picture is not the clearest and the nighttime and dark mansion parts are hard to make out.  I would love to see a pristine clear, re-mastered version released to DVD very soon.  The film itself is worth buying.",1379721600,9,580,4.647058823529412

8376389,4,B002OSGGPO,"Having grown up in the fifties and Sixties, I have many a time felt drawn to the early days of movies.  Such classics and the Henry Aldrich Series, and those staring Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland filled my time growing up at the Saturday Afternoon Matinee, munching popcorn in front of the Black and White Television Set, did I say Black and White? I mean Pre-color, Pre-LCD or Plasma. This is a great copy and I really enjoy it.  I would recommend it to those interested in 1930's movies, and escapism.  It is a lot of silly fun and adventure, well suited for all those from 7 to adult.",1263686400,15,588,4.376146788990826
