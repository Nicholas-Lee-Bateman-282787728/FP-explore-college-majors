8542884,3,B009LYDJEA,"the blue ray met my expectations regarding picture and sound quality. Movie itself was ok, expected more.  Good story taking place during the Franco Regime after their civil war, nothing exceptional. Have seen better movies of the era. Beautiful Blanca Suarez part in the movie , was nothing special to talk about.  Have seen much better movies of the Spanish civil war and post civil war Era.
As advertised the movie is in the European 2 format. So you need a region free, or multiple region  dvd/blue ray player to watch it.",1509148800,,526,4.695652173913044
