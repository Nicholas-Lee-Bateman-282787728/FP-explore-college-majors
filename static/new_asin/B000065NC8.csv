Suddenly is the name of a small town in California(Gold First Discovered Here in 1842). A young boy says his mom won't let him see war pictures. [Wouldnt a Western move be more likely then?] He wants a toy pistol. [His father was killed in the war.] Todd is in love with Ellen, she has been a widow for three years. Guns aren't necessarily bad, it depends on who uses them says Todd (a peace officer). She tells her son to remove that pistol. Todd says the boy must learn about the world. A confidential message on the telegraph tells of an emergency! A special train will arrive with the President and security must be provided. Sheriff Todd makes arrangements. Secret Service Agents arrive in town.

The stores facing the train station must be inspected. That house on the hill too. [Is a lone mother the best guide for a son?] Pidge spots the caravan of cars on the highway. Todd shows the routes to that ranch. They want the stores closed before the President arrives. Three strange men arrive at that house on the hill, they say they are FBI Agents and want to look around the house. Nobody leaves the house. He explains why - to protect the President. No strangers were in town. This isn't routine. The Sheriff and Dave Carney arrive to inspect that house. The visitors reveal their true nature! A passing train muffles the shots. The criminals set up a table by the window for a solid base. The leader says he won a Silver Star for killing 27 enemy soldiers at Cassino. Pop has a pistol but the cartridges were hidden! [No gun locks were required then.] Todd knows what will happen: no witnesses left behind.

Johnny shows his leadership. The TV repairman visits to join the captives. They wait for five oclock. Johnny asks for food. He tells about his youth. Johnny says he doesnt know who he is working for! [Motive?] Johnny learned a skill in the war that he used to earn a living afterwards. [For some its auto mechanics.] The criminal sent into town is caught, the shooting warns the police. Johnny acts to solve this problem. Pop Benson suggests a fix to the TV. Pidge retrieves the pills and that pistol! Todd tells the criminals they should leave with what money they already received. But something goes wrong! The shooting is a warning. It didn't stop! The actions of ordinary men prevented the assassination. Pop Benson will be alright, the TV repairman didn't make it. Todd will get a reward. [It takes a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun.]

This is an interesting story in itself and as a picture of small town life in 1950's southern California. Note the importance of the railroad. Movies charged 25 cents for admission. Ten cents bought a comic book [before they were attacked to eliminate competition to television]. This movie was removed from circulation after November 22, 1963; it is an implied criticism of the Warren Reports lone gunman theory. Sterling Hayden had an interesting life. He joined the Marines as a private, tested well, and was sent to OCS. Afterwards he joined the OSS and was parachuted into Yugoslavia during WW II.",1446595200,,3099,4.608695652173913

7961155,4,B000065NC8,"Just two years before he made Suddenly, Frank Sinatra thought he was finished. His vocal cords had hemorrhaged, and ""The Voice"" almost fell silent. Movie producers were no longer interested in making light musical comedies starring the kid from Hoboken, and no one took him seriously as a dramatic actor, a field where he had no track record. And he could feel the love of his life, Ava Gardner, slipping out of his grasp.
Well, Sinatra got his vocal chords fixed. And after a manic lobbying campaign, he got the role of a lifetime, as the heroic but ill-fated, ""Pvt. Angelo Maggio,"" in the 1953 film From Here to Eternity. With Sinatra's help, the movie won eight Oscars, including his own, richly deserved one for best supporting actor.
For the next 12 or so years (through Von Ryan's Express), until one of the longest midlife crises in world history took over, Frank Sinatra was among the world's greatest movie actors. Unfortunately, the third aspect of his life could not be saved. By 1955, he and Ava Gardner had split up, though as she wrote in her autobiography, Ava, they would have occasional ""reunions"" in hotels around the world, over the next 30-odd years, until her death in 1990.
Going for the role of Maggio was a huge gamble for a man who had no history of straight dramatic acting, but then, Sinatra was nothing if not a gambler.
And so in 1954, he starred in the kind of insane movie that could have ended his fledgling, dramatic movie career. Suddenly (what a lousy title!) is the name of a California hamlet, where the President of the United States will happen to pass through, for about the time it takes to smoke a cigarette. Only the Secret Service knows this - and a small group of assassins posing as Secret Service agents, led by ""Johnny Baron"" (Sinatra).
Johnny is a homicidal sociopath who has no qualms about doing what was then ""the unthinkable."" ""Sure, I like choppin'"" (shooting). He has a $500,000 contract to kill the President, and so kill him, he will.
(Sinatra would go on, in 1962, to co-produce and co-star in yet another - big-budget - movie about a plot to assassinate the president, The Manchurian Candidate. Under the late John Frankenheimer's direction of Richard Condon's classic political thriller, Sinatra gave a now hilarious, now moving performance as insomniac Capt. Bennett Marco. But the following year, his friend, President John F. Kennedy, would be assassinated, and so for the next 30 years, Sinatra would pull Suddenly and The Manchurian Candidate out of distribution.)
The era of the anti-hero had just begun, with Marlon Brando's 1953 performance as motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler, in The Wild One. But not even the young Brando had ... like Sinatra. No one had shot a president since William ""Big Bill"" McKinley in '01, and no one made movies about assassins.
But Sinatra did. Working almost entirely on one set, on a shoestring budget, and squaring off against dramatic (and physical) heavyweight Sterling Hayden (as ""Sheriff Tod Shaw""), he gave a towering performance.
Johnny and his accomplices take the Benson family hostage. The Bensons' house has a clear shot at the spot where the President will disembark from his train. ""Pop Benson"" (James Gleason) is a retired Secret Service agent, whose widowed, pacifist daughter-in-law, ""Ellen"" (Nancy Gates), has been rebuffing Tod Shaw's attempts at courtship. Ellen Benson holds all who wield weapons equally in contempt.
Johnny likes to talk, and he has a captive audience. Literally. The set-piece around which the picture revolves, is a soliloquy Johnny delivers, on his failed life as a civilian, as a lost soul, wandering about an anonymous, non-descript, unnamed metropolis.
""Before, I drifted and drifted and ran, always lost in a great, big crowd. I hated that crowd, used to dream about the crowd, once in a while. I used to see all those faces, scratchin' and shovin' and bitin.' And then the mist would clear, and somehow all the faces would be me. All me, and nothin.'""
This is not the spirit of the post-WWII generation. It has a vague aroma of the post-WWI ""Lost Generation,"" but the full flavor is from a different place altogether. It is the spirit of Hitler's Vienna, following World War I, the spirit of fascism.
Now, I realize that logically this doesn't jibe. After all, Johnny doesn't work in a collective, the way the fascists and Nazis did; he's more of a freelancer. And spoken abstractly, overlaying a 1920s, European mentality doesn't work for a story set in America in the mid-1950s. And yet, it does work, gloriously. Give credit to screenwriter Richard Sale, director Lewis Allen, and to ... The Gambler.
(But don't order the Suddenly VHS - the sound quality is horrible! Fortunately, the movie is often broadcast on TV.)
