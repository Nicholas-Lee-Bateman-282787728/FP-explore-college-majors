8212082,5,B000A1CGEM,"I am admittedly *not* a fan of romantic comedies, but I am a fan of Guy Pearce, which is why I originally watched this film. While the premise sounds trite - a scientist (Claudia Karvan) & a talk show host (Pearce) who are complete opposites become lovers, end up butting heads, & eventually switch bodies, learning how the other half lives - it's far from it. This movie is hysterical!  Not only do the two leads have the man/woman switch down pat, they also have the individual indosyncrasies of each other down perfectly. The scenes when they first realize what's happened are some of the funniest I've seen. The minor characters & the soundtrack are delightful as well. It's light-hearted fun, with just enough poignency & romance to keep those who like a traditional romcom happy. Copies of this film used to be hard to come by, as it was only released in Australia, but I had gotten one years ago.  Unfortunately, it got trashed in a house flood, so I was happy that it was now for sale at Amazon because I didn't want my movie library to be without it. I could watch this a million times & still laugh!",1426377600,,1109,4.485148514851486
