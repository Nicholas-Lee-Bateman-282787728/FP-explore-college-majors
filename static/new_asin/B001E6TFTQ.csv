8296873,5,B001E6TFTQ,"Again, as the previous reviewer, as a long-time teacher, I have used this first as a 16mm film, then as a video tape, but those are no longer available to me on the county-wide distribution system.  And I am willing to spend my own money for this one and ""A Wanderer's Guide to the Middle Ages"".  But I just can't afford the price of $60 each.
  In this Roman one, I especially like the play by Plautus (the Braggart Soldier, shown in the figure on far left) and the humorous poems and short pieces by Catullus. The comparisons of Roman laws with current laws is very telling.  The films are good, but hard for teachers who are trying to make up for less and less money being spent in public schools for anything NOT on the highly-restricted set of knowledge-for-the-test.  It's a shame to limit students' learning in the name of having someone to blame for underfunding.",1424217600,,871,4.515923566878981
8296874,3,B001E6TFTQ,"I am an educator at a private school.  I have used this video many times in class because I can get it from a teacher loaning library.  It is an old VHS tape which I would like to replace with a DVD.  I am even willing to spend my own money.  But not 60 dollars worth of it for something less than 25 minutes.  For a lesser price, I can get the entire DVD set of Ken Burns's ""Civil War"", the gold standard of history documentaries.  This is a very good program, nicely done, with penetrating insight and presented in an enjoyable manner for middle school-high school students.  But at this high price, it is a rip off.
  If the price ever comes down, it is a valuable teaching tool about ancient Roman life, otherwise, rewarding a company for overcharging their customers is bad economic policy.",1365120000,2,795,4.390410958904109
