3122483,5,B00144H00Y,"As advertised the 5 disc contains all 24 episode including the 2 part pilot version. I was very apprehensive about the quality as they would have to use a great deal of compression to fit that much video on to 5 discs. But I was very pleased, as I checked each disc the quality is much better than I expected! Yes there is a small amount of artifacting but very little, they did a very good compression job for 5 eps. per disc.
The color looks good and accurate, the print or source material is totally clean and the picture is nice and sharp and clear.
The sound is in true stereo!!!  Has most of the original music is intact -All the songs are the original up till the last 2 episodes of season one, from then on, most original songs (NOT the theme or background effect music they are all original and intact) were replaced with new dubbed material , they did in my opinion a good job, and it seemed to fit nicely with the episodes - they might have had licensing problems - which might have delayed the series from being released
The only problem I have encountered is there are some problems with motion. It has a look of a PAL disc converted to NTSC - the motion at times seem unnatural and not fluid - this may be a result of the rendering or capturing process that was not done correctly.
When you load each disc there is a disclaimer That anomalies may be present due to source material.
I wouldn't be too concerned about the motion problem, it is slight and you notice it mostly when the camera is panning a moving shot, or when people are walking in the scene.
If you liked the show you will not be disappointed with the set and it is a very good quality product.
Yes it could have been slightly better, but it could have been much, much worse. Im very Happy with the DVD set - and it's great to see the show again with a nice clean picture - and stereo sound!
Go ahead and order it - Im very picky about my reviews and this set is thumbs up!",1207699200,168,1952,4.191489361702128
3122484,4,B00144H00Y,"I got my copy of the DVD set and was delighted to have all 24 episodes.  VEI has even gone so far as to include the 30 second promos (with Mike Post music) that began most of the episodes.  Some of the footage looks a tiny bit aged, but that ageing is surely due to the original medium in which the episodes were stored.  Good job, VEI!

However, there are no bonus materials and it turns out that VEI was provided with an edited down version of the 2 hour pilot episode.  Like many shows, Stingray was launched with a 2 hour premier.  Later, when the series was renewed for a second season, the 2 hour pilot was edited down to make it into a two-part episode of 45 minutes each.  In order to make room for a review of what happened in the ""previous episode,"" editors cut scenes from the original 2 hour pilot.  It is this latter, edited version that is included on the DVD set.  Thus, for example, there was a scene in the pilot episode where Ray does Tai Chi while he researches his planned identity as a businessman from Fort Worth.  There was another brief scene where he was on a completely different case and returns a kidnapped child.  These scenes are not in the two-part episode version and are not on the DVD.

I e-mailed the staff at Stephen J. Cannell's website about the issue (Cannell is the guy who wrote the show) and received a very polite reply indicating that ""The pilot was separated into 2 episodes for syndication.  The show was remastered for syndication and that is what was given to VEI for release on DVD.  The original pilot was never remastered and could not be used.""",1207612800,109,1596,4.366101694915254

So i would have to say this is 5 stars not the 3 i gave it before.,1207526400,4,303,4.066666666666666
3122486,5,B00144H00Y,"Stephen J. Cannell's ""Stingray"" finally comes to DVD.  This fine series, cultured with profound scripts with deft direction, provides viewers of all with stories of the mysterious man known only as Stingray.  ""Ray's"" character is portrayed by Nick Mancuso, an actor who seems to have been born for the role with his unique good looks and distinct voice.  ""Ray"" was a cool blend as a master of the martial arts and a man of many faces, very much like ""M.I.""'s ""Roland Hand"".

This series was far ahead of its time, incorporating that wonderful 1980's beat with composer Mike Post leading the way with a fast paced intro score.

Outside of that great 80's music, this 22 year-old show seems more contemporary than ever.  Kind of makes you want to check the want ads for: ""'65 Black Stingray. For Barter Only.""

Neatly packaged in a standard size clear-plastic keep-case for minimal storage.

10.01.10  Rest In Peace Stephen J. Cannell; you will be missed...",1207440000,14,955,4.845679012345679
3122487,5,B00144H00Y,"WOW! I have been waiting for well over ten years for SOMEONE to release this exceptional program on DVD. It is a shame it lasted just two years... apparently Nick Mancuso didn't like the direction the program was going, and quit... but I LOVED IT!

I think of it as KNIGHT RIDER for people with brains! A man driving a top notch car traveling around helping people... but unlike Knight Rider, the lead actor is more than a plastic face.

Ray had a tragic past, and he seems to be redeaming himself for past mistakes but helping others. His only pay, is an agreement that he may come back one day and ask for a favor, and you must do it.

It is difficult to describe this series, you really have to see it to appreciate it.",1207353600,6,722,4.255474452554744
3122488,5,B00144H00Y,"I obviously cannot review the actual DVD set as yet ( at this date, it is delayed until later in 2008).

But the series deserves some PR...

""Someday I'll see you again, and I'll ask you to for a favor, and whatever it is... you must do it"" -- `Ray's stated terms for his assistance.

STINGRAY, as portrayed by Nick Mancuso, was a former American Intelligence Operative who chose to become an enigmatic loner, helping ordinary people with their problems when they contacted him through a newspaper ad: ""Stingray. For Barter Only.""
  Ray would tackle anything from suspicious death to drug-running to blackmail and his price was always simply ; ""a favor"", which could be any thing, any time, and would be asked in order to help Ray help someone else later on (a gimmick, incidentally, that resurfaced years later on The Equalizer and Vengeance Unlimited) A nice continuity touch was that previous clients did in fact, resurface during the series as Ray would call upon them to help others. Ray was computer savvy at a time well before the proliferation of personal computers, and kept his Stingray Client List, complete with occupations and locations of past clients on a PC which he consulted from time-to-time.

  One of many nice touches was that whenever anyone attempted to run Ray's fingerprints, the match would come back either as someone he clearly was not, or as ""Classified"" by the D.O.D. When his car license plate was run, it would come back as registered to the White House Motor Pool or  to the Governor of the State. The man was A CYPHER from start to finish of each episode, with only a few glimpses into his past and his life as the series progressed.

 Ray was an extremely competent investigator, adopting disguises that went beyond simple make-up. He could assume a complete personna instantly, complete with appropriate dialect, accent and mannerisms  whether he was posing as an effete European hair stylist or a poor, illiterate laborer. Ray was highly skilled in several martial arts and multiple weapons use.

 Although he never called himself ""Stingray"", the name `Ray` was apparently derived from his car, a classic black 1965 Corvette Stingray. Ray tended to favor black in his wardrobe as well.

  The short-lived series had smooth class and a cinematic style. A marvelous job was done matching background theme music with the action.  Nick Mancuso made a slick action/adventure hero and the plots were gripping -- if at times a bit far-fetched. The show ran for 25 episodes, and to the best of my knowledge, would have continued had Mancuso not become a ""problem"" for the production company -- supposedly because he couldn't hack the pressure of a weekly series. Too bad.

Overall, an excellent series, ahead of it`s time, which still stands up as some great entertainment.

Can`t wait for the dvds !",1203379200,89,2830,4.8684759916492695
3122497,5,B00144H00Y,I remember when this was on tv. Great concept. Here you have a guy who does favors for a future favor. It kept you guessing. I like Mancusco better when he plays a good guy.  I wish it was extended. Bought this immediately!,1496188800,,223,4.186046511627907
3122498,2,B00144H00Y,"I purchased the Stingray dvd about a year ago and I have to say time really does improve how movies/tv shows are made.  The dialogue in the show is very dull and cliched and most of the time the volume of the music (which plays constantly through the entire show) competes with the vocalizations of the actors for the viewer's attention.  This show had a lot of potential if the quantity of music was cut down and Mr. Cannell had had competent writers for the dialogue.  The narratives of the shows were consistent with good guy/bad guy, shoot 'em up, naive storylines of much of 1980's and earlier programming.  I purchased a ""Greatest American Hero"" (starring William Kat) dvd collection some years ago and this was substantially higher quality then Cannell's efforts here.  You'll be yawning 20 minutes into the pilot.",1495670400,,821,4.794326241134752

People in trouble call the number looking for help, how they know to call this number is anybody's guess, most of his clients are referred to him by other people he's helped.  Ray seems to be an x CIA operative versed in combat, computers, has access to practically anything he needs to complete a job which usually meant calling in favors from the people he's helped as he never takes money for payment.  He usually drives a black 65 stingray with license plates that trace back to the white house motor pool or the governor's mansion (basically untraceable).  Few know his true identity save for the ones he learned his craft with.  Nick Mancuso played the lead character Ray and was more or less perfect for the part.

3122585,3,B00144H00Y,"I dislike television as a whole. I dislike having to sit through advertisements to wait for each segment of a show to continue on, especially as advertisements are getting longer and longer as the years go by. And I hate having to wait for several dumb, incredibly boring shows to go by before the show or movie I want to watch is finally on. My solution to all this has been to buy the television shows I loved watching on DVD so I can watch them when I want and without interruption.

This show was one I'd never seen nor even heard of before but many shows from the '80's I recall as fun shows to watch although I remember others as not so great as well. People have given this show a high rating so I thought I'd give it a try. Even though many have complained about the music being changed from the original episodes now that they have been recorded onto DVDs, I felt that would be no issue with me since I never saw the original showing. But then I wondered, because sometimes it is the music that helps make a show, more than the show itself.

For example, Bosom Buddies (1980-1982)opening and closing credits was originally Billy Joel's ""My Life"" but the DVD version was released with some song that was totally uninspirational and caused me not to go after the set even though I really liked it.

So far ""Stingray"" has seemed to me to be a lackluster cheesy type of 1980's show that is on par with ""The A-Team"" but with fight scenes and car chases that do not inspire of excite me. ""Knight Rider"" was a much better and exciting show for the time and sort. Of course it probably doesn't help that I'm not a sort of person who gets really hyped up over seeing a jazzy car on the road, wishing I was the driver of such a rad car. Also, I just can't tell whether or not it would seem to be a better show if the original music was put back in it, replacing the new music that was placed in the DVDs.

It isn't so bad I've stopped watching it, and I'll probably watch it all the way through as it's not really, really horrible. Still, I just wish...",1418169600,,2052,4.2270408163265305

No issues with the quality;  video and audio are great, all the disks worked fine on my Sony PS3.  I wasn't concerned about the original music issue that others have mentioned.

The series itself was ahead of its time, Nick Mancuso does a GREAT job.  Some of the fight scenes are hokie, but to be expected in an 80's TV show.  Where the series falls apart is the writing and story line.  Some of the episodes are just awful, ones written by Cannell are ok, but others lack quality and any sort of substance.  My guess would be that Cannell had too many projects going on at the same time, and not able to apply a standard of quality to this project.

I was surprised how many of the later episodes had rain in them, then realized there were shot on location in Vancouver B.C.  It was nice to see still shots of the production set during the credits at the end of each episode, nice touch!

I was going to return the whole series but then decided to watch another episode before then. I am glad I did because I was then hooked. I think the series is better than the pilot. I love that in every episode he has a different look and a different take on things - it isn't business as usual. It keeps me guessing as to how he will solve the problem at hand.

With interesting technical story lines that still resonate some 25 years later, this is a very enjoyable show. The car is somewhat the star in places, and I feel bad that it wears a quickie paint job and some fake vitaloni mirrors. View-able standard DVD quality it is period correct for the series, and there are some interesting artifacts from the transfer, but nothing that distracts from the watching experience.

Nick Mancuso was the best, i remember an older lady friend turning to me at the time it aired in 86-87, saying ""isn't he the cutest?"" Indeed. I think maybe the series doesn't hold up as well as some others thought it did, as it seems like Miami Vice for a slower crowd but it's great to see cameos by Susan Blakely and so many other starlets from the 70s.

3122727,1,B00144H00Y,"NBC Universal has a well earned reputation for improperly promoting new, creative TV shows and then cancelling them well before they've had a chance to build an audience. They also have a well deserved reputation for releasing these programs onto DVD in the cheapest manner possible, and this show is no exception.  This program has been released without its original music, something they did with another NBC show called ""Life"". The original broadcast version of Life had a killer soundtrack that was specifically formulated to enhance the overall viewing experience. Releasing it with cheap lame canned background music was a travesty. Guess they figure people will buy it anyway, so why pay a little extra to release a show as it originally aired. Just shows you where NBC Universal's priorities lie. No wonder they're in last place.",1346457600,18,837,5.109489051094891

Sounds trivial, I know, but when Ray walks into the diner to find everybody dead, coffee still hot, jukebox playing Gale Garnett's We'll Sing In The Sunshine, it was eerie as heck! They've put some random (my guess is made-up) song on instead.  I know I'm not remembering it incorrectly because I checked on the VIDEO I'd made from the television. It takes away from an important scene and seems like a lame thing to do. Does anyone have any idea why they'd do this? I'm curious. ALSO disc 1 kept cutting out with the message "" skipping over damaged area"". A bit weird considering it was right out of the box and on it's first play.

The most exciting part of the show was the fact nobody really knew who ""Ray"" was. He seemed to be a drifter who just wanted to help people and solve cases.

3122746,5,B00144H00Y,"I loved this show in the 80's. Ray and his corvette were mysterious and Nick Mancuso was a very versatile actor. I wish he had more feature roles in more projects. This was two short seasons of fun. The first few episodes seemed heavily influenced by the Miami Vice era, almost like a music video. By the end I had to laugh at some of the situations Ray found himself in - like Cry Wolf. They took away his super smooth persona and threw him a few curve balls.

I've missed Stingray since it went off the air in the 80s so I was glad to get these dvds and relive it. It was very interesting to think that the main characters of this series were Nick Mancuso and the 1965 Corvette Stingray.

3122748,5,B00144H00Y,"I NEVER take time for Reviews .. but for Mancuso .. anything!  I so very much remember falling for 'Ray' while this was on TV in the 80's .. back before DVR .. some of US didn't even afford VCR's .. So to be able to watch on TV-WEEKLY like today's programming (My Sons are Spoiled beyond comprehension-they have NO idea what we endured back then) was Never an option. Having said that, to remember a Show/Character so fondly from back then, say's something.  'Stingray' was One of a kind .. as was 'Ray' ..  I was Thrilled to see this on DVD, and affordable, as most from this era are 'Season 1 Part 1' for $$$, then waiting for 'Season 1 Part 2' to be released 6 months later for $$$, rip off.  I would have paid far more for 'Stingray' and have paid far to much for 'Others' .. I found the quality of the DVD to be Just fine, I could only wish for better Sound .. Or for Mancuso to walk out of My TV Screen ..  Setting that aside .. In a World full of wanna be 'so called' Actors, Mancuso is not only an Excellent Actor, but an Excellent Character Actor. Humility, Charm, Humor, Personality, Timing, a Natural.  So rare.  Why is it that a Show with a great Message, and Story lines, are so short lived, and underrated?  Yet, trash shows/movies live on FOREVER?  I hope that 'Stingray' now it's on DVD will have it's 2nd chance to live on FOREVER, and get the credit it deserves!  I would like to see 'Stingray' made into a Movie, and Mancuso cast as a 'Mentor' to someone fitting enough to fill 'Ray's Shoes' ...  and including some kind of 'Ending' or 'Continuation' to Ray's Life after 2 Seasons .. Since it was left 'Hanging' .. BTW: A Classic Car does NOT define a Man!  I'd be happy to re-pay the favor, anytime! 'A Villager' ...",1326931200,,1736,4.2272727272727275

3122751,4,B00144H00Y,"I received this as a gift about a week ago and I finally got the opportunity to watch it.  In going through just the first three episodes (which is actually the pilot and the first episode following) there is a noticeable difference in the music.  The original music written for the series is still in tact.  However, the music that likely required music company buy off on it is dubbed over.  Not nearly as bad as the 21 Jump Street disaster where the dubbed in music plays REALLY BAD over the dialog.  But to those that knew and loved the show this is a definite negative.

Beyond that there is missing material in the pilot episode likely lost when they had to split it for syndication.  Stingray without the music is still a solid show.  Worth the money as it stands now somewhere around $25 or lower.  I would be curious to see if Mill Creek Entertainment went to the various music companies and bartered what the price might be to keep the music in it.  Because honestly, I would pay up to $100 for the DVD set if it was in fact complete with original music.

3122776,5,B00144H00Y,"Stingray is a great TV show that holds up really well.  It's one of my favorite Stephen J. Cannell shows.  It featured a fascinating man of mystery played by Nick Mancuso.  The show reveals very little about the character.  Which creates a somewhat frustrating dichotomy of loving the mysterious nature of the character while at the same time wanting to know more about the character's past. In other words, you both love it and hate it.

It had a diverse array of storylines featuring some clever ideas.  I especially liked Ray's special Stingray headlight attachment that was used in the ""Ether"" episode.  Which he used to convince people that they weren't being followed.

Ray's ability to step into a variety of roles at the drop of the hat was a bit similar to Jarod in The Pretender.

Another great feature of the show were the wonderful songs created for the show by Mike Post, Stephen Geyer, and others.  Songs like those in the ""Ether"", ""Orange Blossom"", and ""Neniwa"" episodes.

The biggest disappointment, for me, music wise, was that the beautiful rendition of ""I'll Fly Away"" was removed from the ""That Terrible Swift Sword"" episode for the DVD release.",1299283200,2,1165,4.833333333333333

For my part, I didn't see any differences when listeneing to the DVD and I am perfectly satisfied with it's quality. I used to watch this serie when it was originaly on air in the 80's and I enjoyed Stingray very much. Maybe beaucause of the mystery surronding the main character(played by Nick Mancuso) and maybe beacause of the beautiful ""Stingray"" corvette he is driving. Just like in some other show, the vehicule is a""star"" of the show even if it is just a material object. This is an action series of course but the way the scenario was written makes it a little different and fun to watch. When you see the main charachter disapear at the end of an episode, you always think that on the next show you will finally find out who he is and why he is doing all this but.....The DVD case is neat too, all the disc are individually stored in a little pouche are held in the case by a plastic frame. This makes it very easy to retreive the disc and this arrangement  turn the case  to be not too thick but the pouch are loose  within their frame som they might fell if you turn the case while it is open so be careful!
Thank's to the company who made ""Stingray"" available on DVD, for me it's a great buy.

3122779,5,B00144H00Y,"First of all, let me tell you I loved this series when it first aired in late 80s. I always liked the resourcefulness of the main character and wondered if anyone could live off out of favors... and yet be able to help others in need. The DVD set is poor packed and I guess it is so to cope with the low pricing of the set. I don't mind, I just didn't like that the pilot is somewhat a shorter version than the one I remember seeing decades ago.

I will leave the technical details to the other reviewers, which pretty much covers it all.

This series is really good although it was short lived and I think it was a pity. Of all the episodes, *Sometimes you've gotta sing the blues* is my favorite. A bittersweet story with great acting and an outstanding theme song. It is a very sad story about personal sacrifices you are asked to make in life for the greater good of others or the one who cares most to you - ""That's Life. And sometimes you've gotta sing the blues""; and the theme song fits in it marvelously and it goes more or less like this (don't recall the exact lyrics):

""You've been waiting a life time \ even but a lucky break \ hanging on to a lifeline \ that's where you made your first mistake \ Sometimes you've gotta sing the blues \ a little looney goes a long long way \ ... \ Sometimes there's nothing but the blues \ when you got nothing there to loose \ Oh you've gotta sing the blues...""

A few years ago, I contacted the singer of the song to ask if she ever recorded that song and she said no; that that song was recorded only for that particular episode. *A very cool song* as she stated. I wish she had recorded it and I would get it...

A must see series that I highly recommend. It is the *Burn Notice* without the money :)

3122780,5,B00144H00Y,"For my wife and I, this is one of our favorite TV series of all time. Stingray managed comedy, action, spy motifs, sci-fi, social relevance, romance, and just plain fun all at the same time. Nick Mancuso brought it off with a remarkable charm that sold the show.

I have read recently that the series stopped because Mancuso could not see himself being tied down to a series any longer. Having read many times of Mancuso's quirky and independent slant regarding life and career, I had no trouble believing that to be true. However, its too bad. This was the role of a lifetime for any versatile actor, and looking back, I'll bet he realized that he could have stood a few more years of a quality role such as Ray, compared to some of the weak supporting roles he was stuck with in years thereafter. Like many actors, he probably eschewed the TV bird in the hand feeling that a long string of strong leading roles was within his grasp. And like many actors, he found that future to be ultimately elusive.

The show's concepts of mercenary help for barter, and a supremely mysterious main character, were very different and highly enjoyable. Mancuso's ability to mold himself into many personas ... just as enjoyable. His southern accent? Not so good, but forgivable in view of the hours of entertainment he brought otherwise. LOL

This DVD set is far better than viewing your 20+ year old VHS tapes of the series, but it is not a top quality transfer. It is a Canadian product.

3122784,5,B00144H00Y,"The 1980's action TV to me was Wiseguy, The A Team and Stingray. Stingray, Created by Stephen J Cannell,  was an adventure series, like the A Team. A man who takes a case who the deal that he will ask a favor. His identity was unknown to anyone. The pilot hinted a vietname vet and a P.O.W

The action adventure is nonstop. Think the Lone Ranger with a Stingay auto instead of a horse. Nick Mancuso takes the lead and makes the mysterious Ray an enigma to keep watching.

NBC were idiots in 1986, they moved this show from time slot to time slot instead of giving this show a chance to grow. It lasted only two seasons (25 episodes), but enough for this show to have a cult following

This Mill Creek product has the clearest master recording for 1986 shows. This 10 hours of this show will make you wanting for more.

The powers that be in Hollywood  been remaking shows like the Bionic Woman, Knight Rider, Hawaii Five O and Charlie's Angels, I wish someone would be smart to remake this one. Until then you will enjoy this show on DVD

In fact, I taped a couple of my favorites, which are now long gone after too many moves.  So imagine my pleasant surprise when ""Stingray"" came out on DVD - I immediately ordered the set.

I actually wanted one episode that was my #1 favorite, ""That Terrible Swift Sword"" (hope I got it right).  To me, the last scene was the best, with Nick looking out onto the harbor, the church hymn ""I'll Fly Away"" playing in the background, while he gets into his car and drives away.  Brings tears to my eyes every time.

So when I heard the ""new"" music - some other hymn or whatever - that the Powers That Be substituted, it ruined the whole thing for me.  Oh sure, it's probably got something to do with copyrights and use of material and blah, blah, blah.  Money is always a BIG DEAL which is why Thirtysomething hasn't come out just yet.  Everybody wants yet another buck,  Well, the substitute song doesn't have the poignancy of ""I'll Fly Away"" and I don't have to see any of the discs again.  Guess I'll try to sell 'em used on eBay.  Yes, I should get over myself, but I was so looking forward to this episode and now I don't care.  Wonder what other music they tinkered with?",1247529600,33,1310,4.293877551020408

3122802,5,B00144H00Y,"""Stingray"" the complete series is presented for the first time on DVD in this amazing five disc set from Vei. All 24 episodes of the 1986-87 TV series including the two part pilot episode are included for your viewing enjoyment. There is a disclaimer that comes on when each disc is inserted warning of certain anomalies in the quality. I'm not sure why it's on all the discs because other than the pilot episode the quality in my opinion is excellent. You can play the episodes individually or use the play all feature. The video transfers are crisp and clean and the colors are vibrant and sharp. The audio is really good and the opening theme song from Mike Post and the 80's style soundtrack is awesome. The five single sided discs come in a clear standard DVD case with great artwork and detail. The set is well done and Vei should be commended for their efforts.

From series creator Stephen J. Cannell comes one of my favorite television shows of all time ""Stingray"". This series had it all in my opinion and it got cancelled way too soon. Former intelligence specialist ""Stingray"" or Ray as he's called is in the business of helping people out of sticky situations. Ray drives a 1965 Corvette Stingray, he is highly skilled in weapons combat and hand to hand combat and as a former intelligence specialist he can hack into any computer database. The only way to contact him is through a classified add in the newspaper and clients must agree to his terms or he won't meet them. Ray is a specialist and the best at what he does and he can assume the persona of anyone at anytime and make it all seem believable. Ray provides a service to those in need and when the job is done he tells them that they simply owe him a favor. The favor, Ray's form of payment for his expert help is to be repaid when the time comes and those he has helped cannot refuse him. ""Stingray"" benefited from great scripts, solid acting and solid character development each week and it's a shame it ended so soon.

DVD Episodes Include:

Pilot Part 1 / Pilot Part 2 / Ancient Eyes / Ether / Below the Line / Sometimes You Gotta Sing the Blues / Abnormal Psych / Orange Blossom / Less Than the Eye Can See / That Terrible Swift Sword / The Greeter / Gemini / Playback / Bring Me the Hand That Hit Me / Echoes / The First Time is Forever / Autumn / The Neniwa / The Second Finest Man Who Ever Lived / Night Maneuvers / Cry Wolf / Blood Money / Anytime Anywhere / Caper / One Way Ticket to the End of the Line /",1233273600,3,2489,4.302771855010661
3122803,4,B00144H00Y,"I've been watching Stingray the complete series and it was wild! It was quite a thing for me to adjust to episodes being so clear because the five shows I recorded when the show first came out had awful reception.

I didn't know what so-called anomalies there were that each disk warned about because I saw none of it, and the only jerky motion I saw was when my computer went on its scans. When I halted them, all jerkiness of motion stopped.

I can't understand why those who contacted Ray were so concerned about who he really was, what was his real name, why he did favors for payment, when he'll be back to collect his favor. Who cares! If you tell me your name is the Pillsbury Dough Boy why bother question it? Beats being called ""Hey You"". Who cares why he collects favors instead of money. It's so much cheaper. Who cares what his background is that made him who he is. He accepts my case, that's all that should matter. Why some of the characters seemed relieved that their favors weren't the horror they thought they'd be is mind boggling. Ray should've been trusted a little more since he helped them out of jams.

I loved the writing in all but two episodes. The episode with Jeff Conaway from Taxi playing a self-absorbed actor who was such a jerk running from people trying to kill him, and the episode with the woman writer and her whining sister slowly poisoning her, listening to the horrible writing of that so-called writer typing her schlocky writing and using it as a voice over, was a bitter reminder that sometimes show writers will resort to crap when they have no good ideas because it seems better than no idea at all.

Despite my complaints, I still love my Stingray CD's. I've had no problem with jerkiness of motion unless my scans come on. I got the CD's  in excellent condition and a day earlier than promised.  I love the graphics as soon as a CD is popped in with moving shots of episodes while the theme song that I can never get enough of, plays. I like that you can play a disk's episodes singly or all at once if you want to make a marathon of it. I like the liner notes about Ray's character, and of course, I like Nick Mancuso's pictures.

Ray you'll always be my favorite! Now for the favor I've been waiting to collect on  for years. Move over and let me drive!",1225411200,2,2303,4.364485981308412
3122804,5,B00144H00Y,"I was a teenager when I first watched Stingray and I must say, this show was a real breakthrough. I'll never understand why it was not a huge success but it is finally available for us all to watch over and over again!",1224460800,2,218,4.093023255813954

I am watching some of the 1st season episodes for the first time.  What a shame the show was never able to attract the audience that it deserved.

Along with Wiseguy,  this is some of Steven J. Cannell's best work.  The premise is unique, the characters are interesting,  and Nick Mancuso is fabulous as Ray.  The Mike Post music is perfect. Oh yes, and that 1965 Corvette Stingray ""for barter only"" is pretty cool.

If you never saw the series,  buy it,  you will not be disappointed!",1219881600,3,627,4.4035087719298245
3122807,5,B00144H00Y,"This is a great series that was treated very shoddily by the network.  According to ""Adventures in Prime Time:  The Television Programs of Stephen J. Cannell"" by Robert J. Thompson, NBC wanted a light, comedic show, and when Stephen J. Cannell delivered the Stingray pilot, a dark, moody mystery-adventure, the network passed on the series.  However, high ratings for the pilot meant that the network reluctantly ordered eight episodes, thus resulting in Season One of Stingray.  After that, the network tried cancelling the series again, but then needed filler for a dead-end timeslot, and ordered 15 more episodes at the last minute, resulting in Season 2.  Because of how NBC buried the show, it did not survive its third cancellation, and viewers lost out on one of the most innovative, clever, and stylish shows of the 80's.

Nick Mancuso is mesmerizing as Stingray.  He manages to convey a haunted compassion that elevates the character above what could have been a stereotypical womanizing loner, and the glimpses of Stingray's past are fascinating.  Mancuso also does an amazing job at the many undercover guises Ray uses to crack the case (some favourites:  Italian hairdresser, Mexican field worker, surgeon, casting agent, Greek chemist, college student).  Mancuso's only weakness seems to be the fight sequences. Having a martial arts-trained hero was innovative at the time, but the use of stunt men instead of Mancuso was rather obvious. All in all, though, Ray was a complex and charismatic hero whose mysterious past would have remained intriguing for many seasons to come.

The stories were also extremely clever.  The pilot and the first season, especially, were full of complex plots and deep characterization.  The relationship between Ray and the guest stars was given proper depth, and Ray was shown to make mistakes, and have to recover from them.  Season 2 was more uneven, mostly because the shows were ordered at the last minute.  Some of the stories were obviously rushed (The Neniwa, Blood Money), or did not even match the continuity about Ray's past from the first season (Gemini, The First Time is Forever).  But the second season also introduced humour, in such fantastic episodes as Autumn (a parody of film noir) , Caper (a parody of caper movies), and Cry Wolf (where a spoiled movie star drives Ray crazy).  It is a tribute to the versatility both of the premise and Mancuso himself that these espisodes can be so hilarious, and still not undermine the inherent dignity of Ray's purpose.  It is too bad that the network squashed this show before it could fulfill its promise.

Another stylish signature of the show was the embedded ""music video"" in each episode, similar to Miami Vice.  However, the songs were written especially for the show, which sometimes backfired (bad 80's pop is just hideous), but sometimes worked amazingly well.  The songs that still stand up to this day are in ""Ether"", ""Below the Line"", ""Orange Blossom"", ""The Greeter"" (this one moves me to tears), ""Echoes"", and ""Autumn"".  Since I don't have copies of the original broadcasts, I was only made aware of soundtrack substitutions after reading some of the other reviews.  It's too bad, since music contributed greately to the moodiness of the show, but I guess I have to grateful that Stingray made it to DVD at all.

It is truly a shame that this show didn't get the chance it deserved.  Even having only seen a few episodes just once when I was a teenager, Stingray made such an impression on me that I remembered it vividly 20 years later when this set was released.  I am happy to say that it is even better than I remember!  Highly recommended.",1218326400,5,3662,4.912195121951219
3122808,5,B00144H00Y,"I have been waiting for this series to come to DVD for years, checking in every now and then. If you were a fan of the show, it is worth every penny.

3122809,5,B00144H00Y,"Would add my favorable review to the others here. The audio/visual quality is good. The liner notes are okay although a little more detail would have been nice. The plastic case is adequate.

The show itself? The interesting thing is that it's an anthology: Ray is the only main character, so you've got an almost anonymous character who can easily be slotted into any number of stories. During the course of the series they did Amerindian supernatural (""The Ninewah""), a technology breakdown (""Playback""), a viral outbreak (""Less Than the Eye Can See""), serial killers, street gangs (""Blood Money""), Bond-style villains (an unnamed villain in ""Abnormal Psych"" who sadly didn't return), psychodramas, political intrigue (""Sometimes You Got To Sing the Blues""), and comedies. The comedies are among the best: check out ""Caper"" (a near-perfect parody of ""Mission: Impossible""), ""Autumn"" (a parody of ""Murder She Wrote""), and ""Cry Wolf"" with a hilariously over-the-top Jeff Conaway as an actor who ropes Ray into a showdown with the Mafia and the Yakuza.

As suits an anthology, Nick Mancuso plays many different roles within the role, able to take on the persona of a surgeon or a revival preacher at the drop of a hat. While good with a gun and martial arts, he's just as capable of getting through to a brainwashed killer just by being persuasive (""Abnormal Psych""). He also displays a photographic memory and the ability to temporarily stop his heart.

The musical scores are good, and each show ends with shots of the production crew taken during the episode.

Overall, highly recommended. Comes across as a bit dated with the 80s clothing styles and computer tech, but as noted elsewhere, it's really a pretty timeless kind of show. Wonder when someone will do a remake in these years of remake-heavy TV revival shows?",1210550400,10,1821,5.0198675496688745

3122811,5,B00144H00Y,"It sounds like an exaggeration but it's true...I've been waiting nearly 20 years to see this series again!

I caught a few episodes on TV as a kid in the 80s and was amazed by it...so different to what else was on TV at the time - yeah, it was an action/adventure/detective kind of series but it was actually intelligent and thoughtful. Unfortunately, because of the TV timeslot, I missed most of the episodes and was desperate to see the repeats - but they never came.

The series just seemed to vanish as mysteriously as it first appeared...very appropriate for Stingray as you'll know if you watch it.

Now, expecting to be let down (as you usually are when re-experiencing childhood memories), I'm finally watching these episodes again and I'm amazed at how good they are.

And, looking back, I see that the unique idea of a hero who deals only in trading favours is one that has influenced me quite a bit over the years as I've grown up.

Nick Mancuso's interpretation of action hero ""Ray"" is full of warmth and humanity, and is surprisingly believable. Reminds me a bit of the depth that Harrison Ford gave to the character of Indiana Jones as compared to the wooden, cardboard-cutout ""heroes"" that came before Raiders of The Lost Ark.

Stingray is not your ordinary throwaway TV series by any means. Look past all the 80's styles/clothing/music and there's a timeless archetypal quality to it all.

If you like Knight Rider, A-Team, Airwolf etc. then here's a series that has all the appeal of those without requiring you to leave your brain at the door.",1209945600,6,1561,4.675182481751825

3122813,5,B00144H00Y,"I don't write reviews very often and others have already given helpful comments, so I will try to distill what it is that made this show my favorite of all time.  Ever.

To me, this series combines great acting, good music, interesting story plots, a 1965 Corvette, martial arts action, and just the right touch of poignancy as our mysterious hero, Ray,  helps others without payment except for his client's promise to grant a favor in return.  Often experiencing romantic feelings in the process,  Ray ends up having to leave each adventure behind as he moves on to help someone else, driven by whatever pushes him on in his private quest to be the modern day Robin Hood.  That quality keeps his character from being arrogant or overly macho.  We marvel at what he can accomplish, but feel his self-imposed loneliness.  This makes him just sympathetic enough that while we celebrate his victories, we also admire him in the process.

This show was filmed in 1986, only 15 years after the close of the Vietnam war.  The creators of the show did a good job of tapping into the tragic past of that war and Ray's mysterious connection to it.  As a result of whatever the character experienced in 'Nam, it continues to drive him onward to rescue and help people out of jams.  The result is always a generous helping of action and suspense.

I remember getting hooked on this show when it came out.  By then, a few episodes had run, but I figured it would last forever, so I taped some episodes and then taped over them with something else.  To my horror, I realized when the show stopped that I had nothing to re-watch.  For an all too short time, our local TV station ran rebroadcasts in the wee hours of the morning in 1991 after late night updates on the Gulf War.  I would set my VCR to try to catch some of those; I ended up with a few complete episodes and a few half-episodes, hanging on to them like a starving man, wating and waiting for someone to finally release the series.

Now, after 22 years, it has finally happened.  The complete set is here and life is good.

If you know this show, you, like me, probably already have your copy.  If you don't know this show - this would be one worth buying.  It will not disappoint.  Bear in mind that when the show was made, we were just getting into computers, so their use will appear a little dated.

But I was very pleased, as I checked each disc the quality is much better than I expected! Yes there is a small amount of artifacting but very little, they did a very good compression job for 5 eps. per disc.
The color looks good and accurate, the print or source material is totally clean and the picture is nice and sharp and clear.
The sound is in true stereo!!!  Has most of the original music is intact -All the songs are the original up till the last 2 episodes of season one, from then on, most original songs (NOT the theme or background effect music they are all original and intact) were replaced with new dubbed material , they did in my opinion a good job, and it seemed to fit nicely with the episodes - they might have had licensing problems - which might have delayed the series from being released
The only problem I have encountered is there are some problems with motion. It has a look of a PAL disc converted to NTSC - the motion at times seem unnatural and not fluid - this may be a result of the rendering or capturing process that was not done correctly.
When you load each disc there is a disclaimer That anomalies may be present due to source material.
I wouldn't be too concerned about the motion problem, it is slight and you notice it mostly when the camera is panning a moving shot, or when people are walking in the scene.
If you liked the show you will not be disappointed with the set and it is a very good quality product.
Yes it could have been slightly better, but it could have been much, much worse. Im very Happy with the DVD set - and it's great to see the show again with a nice clean picture - and stereo sound!

VEI has even gone so far as to include the 30 second promos (with Mike Post music) that began most of the episodes.  Some of the footage looks a tiny bit aged, but that ageing is surely due to the original medium in which the episodes were stored.  Good job, VEI!

However, there are no bonus materials and it turns out that VEI was provided with an edited down version of the 2 hour pilot episode.  Like many shows, Stingray was launched with a 2 hour premier.  Later, when the series was renewed for a second season, the 2 hour pilot was edited down to make it into a two-part episode of 45 minutes each.  In order to make room for a review of what happened in the ""previous episode,"" editors cut scenes from the original 2 hour pilot.  It is this latter, edited version that is included on the DVD set.  Thus, for example, there was a scene in the pilot episode where Ray does Tai Chi while he researches his planned identity as a businessman from Fort Worth.  There was another brief scene where he was on a completely different case and returns a kidnapped child.  These scenes are not in the two-part episode version and are not on the DVD.

I e-mailed the staff at Stephen J. Cannell's website about the issue (Cannell is the guy who wrote the show) and received a very polite reply indicating that ""The pilot was separated into 2 episodes for syndication.  The show was remastered for syndication and that is what was given to VEI for release on DVD.  The original pilot was never remastered and could not be used.""",1207612800,109,1596,4.366101694915254

This fine series, cultured with profound scripts with deft direction, provides viewers of all with stories of the mysterious man known only as Stingray.  ""Ray's"" character is portrayed by Nick Mancuso, an actor who seems to have been born for the role with his unique good looks and distinct voice.  ""Ray"" was a cool blend as a master of the martial arts and a man of many faces, very much like ""M.I.""'s ""Roland Hand"".

This series was far ahead of its time, incorporating that wonderful 1980's beat with composer Mike Post leading the way with a fast paced intro score.

Ray had a tragic past, and he seems to be redeaming himself for past mistakes but helping others. His only pay, is an agreement that he may come back one day and ask for a favor, and you must do it.

It is difficult to describe this series, you really have to see it to appreciate it.",1207353600,6,722,4.255474452554744

But the series deserves some PR...

""Someday I'll see you again, and I'll ask you to for a favor, and whatever it is... you must do it"" -- `Ray's stated terms for his assistance.

STINGRAY, as portrayed by Nick Mancuso, was a former American Intelligence Operative who chose to become an enigmatic loner, helping ordinary people with their problems when they contacted him through a newspaper ad: ""Stingray. For Barter Only.""
  Ray would tackle anything from suspicious death to drug-running to blackmail and his price was always simply ; ""a favor"", which could be any thing, any time, and would be asked in order to help Ray help someone else later on (a gimmick, incidentally, that resurfaced years later on The Equalizer and Vengeance Unlimited) A nice continuity touch was that previous clients did in fact, resurface during the series as Ray would call upon them to help others. Ray was computer savvy at a time well before the proliferation of personal computers, and kept his Stingray Client List, complete with occupations and locations of past clients on a PC which he consulted from time-to-time.

  One of many nice touches was that whenever anyone attempted to run Ray's fingerprints, the match would come back either as someone he clearly was not, or as ""Classified"" by the D.O.D. When his car license plate was run, it would come back as registered to the White House Motor Pool or  to the Governor of the State. The man was A CYPHER from start to finish of each episode, with only a few glimpses into his past and his life as the series progressed.

 Ray was an extremely competent investigator, adopting disguises that went beyond simple make-up. He could assume a complete personna instantly, complete with appropriate dialect, accent and mannerisms  whether he was posing as an effete European hair stylist or a poor, illiterate laborer. Ray was highly skilled in several martial arts and multiple weapons use.

 Although he never called himself ""Stingray"", the name `Ray` was apparently derived from his car, a classic black 1965 Corvette Stingray. Ray tended to favor black in his wardrobe as well.

  The short-lived series had smooth class and a cinematic style. A marvelous job was done matching background theme music with the action.  Nick Mancuso made a slick action/adventure hero and the plots were gripping -- if at times a bit far-fetched. The show ran for 25 episodes, and to the best of my knowledge, would have continued had Mancuso not become a ""problem"" for the production company -- supposedly because he couldn't hack the pressure of a weekly series. Too bad.

Overall, an excellent series, ahead of it`s time, which still stands up as some great entertainment.

This show had a lot of potential if the quantity of music was cut down and Mr. Cannell had had competent writers for the dialogue.  The narratives of the shows were consistent with good guy/bad guy, shoot 'em up, naive storylines of much of 1980's and earlier programming.

People in trouble call the number looking for help, how they know to call this number is anybody's guess, most of his clients are referred to him by other people he's helped.  Ray seems to be an x CIA operative versed in combat, computers, has access to practically anything he needs to complete a job which usually meant calling in favors from the people he's helped as he never takes money for payment.  He usually drives a black 65 stingray with license plates that trace back to the white house motor pool or the governor's mansion (basically untraceable).  Few know his true identity save for the ones he learned his craft with.  Nick Mancuso played the lead character Ray and was more or less perfect for the part.

3357082,3,B00144H00Y,"I dislike television as a whole. I dislike having to sit through advertisements to wait for each segment of a show to continue on, especially as advertisements are getting longer and longer as the years go by. And I hate having to wait for several dumb, incredibly boring shows to go by before the show or movie I want to watch is finally on. My solution to all this has been to buy the television shows I loved watching on DVD so I can watch them when I want and without interruption.

This show was one I'd never seen nor even heard of before but many shows from the '80's I recall as fun shows to watch although I remember others as not so great as well. People have given this show a high rating so I thought I'd give it a try. Even though many have complained about the music being changed from the original episodes now that they have been recorded onto DVDs, I felt that would be no issue with me since I never saw the original showing. But then I wondered, because sometimes it is the music that helps make a show, more than the show itself.

For example, Bosom Buddies (1980-1982)opening and closing credits was originally Billy Joel's ""My Life"" but the DVD version was released with some song that was totally uninspirational and caused me not to go after the set even though I really liked it.

So far ""Stingray"" has seemed to me to be a lackluster cheesy type of 1980's show that is on par with ""The A-Team"" but with fight scenes and car chases that do not inspire of excite me. ""Knight Rider"" was a much better and exciting show for the time and sort. Of course it probably doesn't help that I'm not a sort of person who gets really hyped up over seeing a jazzy car on the road, wishing I was the driver of such a rad car. Also, I just can't tell whether or not it would seem to be a better show if the original music was put back in it, replacing the new music that was placed in the DVDs.

It isn't so bad I've stopped watching it, and I'll probably watch it all the way through as it's not really, really horrible. Still, I just wish...",1418169600,,2052,4.2270408163265305

3357086,5,B00144H00Y,"The five DVDs came in a single standard dvd plastic case, no individual sleeves, all stacked together.  No issues with the quality;  video and audio are great, all the disks worked fine on my Sony PS3.  I wasn't concerned about the original music issue that others have mentioned.

The series itself was ahead of its time, Nick Mancuso does a GREAT job.  Some of the fight scenes are hokie, but to be expected in an 80's TV show.  Where the series falls apart is the writing and story line.  Some of the episodes are just awful, ones written by Cannell are ok, but others lack quality and any sort of substance.  My guess would be that Cannell had too many projects going on at the same time, and not able to apply a standard of quality to this project.

I was surprised how many of the later episodes had rain in them, then realized there were shot on location in Vancouver B.C.  It was nice to see still shots of the production set during the credits at the end of each episode, nice touch!

The Car: I'm not really a vette fan, but this one rocked. My only other vette choice would have been the 63 split window.

Would love to see this series rebooted (with a 65 vette), or made into a movie.  It would work!",1416960000,2,1212,4.286343612334802

I was going to return the whole series but then decided to watch another episode before then. I am glad I did because I was then hooked. I think the series is better than the pilot. I love that in every episode he has a different look and a different take on things - it isn't business as usual. It keeps me guessing as to how he will solve the problem at hand.

The car is somewhat the star in places, and I feel bad that it wears a quickie paint job and some fake vitaloni mirrors.

Nick Mancuso was the best, i remember an older lady friend turning to me at the time it aired in 86-87, saying ""isn't he the cutest?"" Indeed. I think maybe the series doesn't hold up as well as some others thought it did, as it seems like Miami Vice for a slower crowd but it's great to see cameos by Susan Blakely and so many other starlets from the 70s.

3357224,1,B00144H00Y,"NBC Universal has a well earned reputation for improperly promoting new, creative TV shows and then cancelling them well before they've had a chance to build an audience. They also have a well deserved reputation for releasing these programs onto DVD in the cheapest manner possible, and this show is no exception.  This program has been released without its original music, something they did with another NBC show called ""Life"". The original broadcast version of Life had a killer soundtrack that was specifically formulated to enhance the overall viewing experience. Releasing it with cheap lame canned background music was a travesty. Guess they figure people will buy it anyway, so why pay a little extra to release a show as it originally aired. Just shows you where NBC Universal's priorities lie. No wonder they're in last place.",1346457600,18,837,5.109489051094891

Sounds trivial, I know, but when Ray walks into the diner to find everybody dead, coffee still hot, jukebox playing Gale Garnett's We'll Sing In The Sunshine, it was eerie as heck! They've put some random (my guess is made-up) song on instead.  I know I'm not remembering it incorrectly because I checked on the VIDEO I'd made from the television. It takes away from an important scene and seems like a lame thing to do. Does anyone have any idea why they'd do this? I'm curious.

The most exciting part of the show was the fact nobody really knew who ""Ray"" was. He seemed to be a drifter who just wanted to help people and solve cases.

3357243,5,B00144H00Y,"I loved this show in the 80's. Ray and his corvette were mysterious and Nick Mancuso was a very versatile actor. I wish he had more feature roles in more projects. This was two short seasons of fun. The first few episodes seemed heavily influenced by the Miami Vice era, almost like a music video. By the end I had to laugh at some of the situations Ray found himself in - like Cry Wolf. They took away his super smooth persona and threw him a few curve balls.

I've missed Stingray since it went off the air in the 80s so I was glad to get these dvds and relive it. It was very interesting to think that the main characters of this series were Nick Mancuso and the 1965 Corvette Stingray.

I so very much remember falling for 'Ray' while this was on TV in the 80's .. back before DVR .. some of US didn't even afford VCR's .. So to be able to watch on TV-WEEKLY like today's programming (My Sons are Spoiled beyond comprehension-they have NO idea what we endured back then) was Never an option. Having said that, to remember a Show/Character so fondly from back then, say's something.  'Stingray' was One of a kind .. as was 'Ray' ..  I was Thrilled to see this on DVD, and affordable, as most from this era are 'Season 1 Part 1' for $$$, then waiting for 'Season 1 Part 2' to be released 6 months later for $$$, rip off.  I would have paid far more for 'Stingray' and have paid far to much for 'Others' .. I found the quality of the DVD to be Just fine, I could only wish for better Sound .. Or for Mancuso to walk out of My TV Screen ..  Setting that aside .. In a World full of wanna be 'so called' Actors, Mancuso is not only an Excellent Actor, but an Excellent Character Actor. Humility, Charm, Humor, Personality, Timing, a Natural.  So rare.  Why is it that a Show with a great Message, and Story lines, are so short lived, and underrated?  Yet, trash shows/movies live on FOREVER?  I hope that 'Stingray' now it's on DVD will have it's 2nd chance to live on FOREVER, and get the credit it deserves!  I would like to see 'Stingray' made into a Movie, and Mancuso cast as a 'Mentor' to someone fitting enough to fill 'Ray's Shoes' ...  and including some kind of 'Ending' or 'Continuation' to Ray's Life after 2 Seasons .. Since it was left 'Hanging' .. BTW: A Classic Car does NOT define a Man!  I'd be happy to re-pay the favor, anytime! 'A Villager' ...",1326931200,,1736,4.2272727272727275

3357248,4,B00144H00Y,"I received this as a gift about a week ago and I finally got the opportunity to watch it.  In going through just the first three episodes (which is actually the pilot and the first episode following) there is a noticeable difference in the music.  The original music written for the series is still in tact.  However, the music that likely required music company buy off on it is dubbed over.  Not nearly as bad as the 21 Jump Street disaster where the dubbed in music plays REALLY BAD over the dialog.  But to those that knew and loved the show this is a definite negative.

Beyond that there is missing material in the pilot episode likely lost when they had to split it for syndication.  Stingray without the music is still a solid show.  Worth the money as it stands now somewhere around $25 or lower.  I would be curious to see if Mill Creek Entertainment went to the various music companies and bartered what the price might be to keep the music in it.  Because honestly, I would pay up to $100 for the DVD set if it was in fact complete with original music.

An extremely original series which provided me with hours of happy entertainment! Sound and picture: good. Some may not like the paper sleeves DVDs are inserted into - personally it doesn't bother me as I am used to buying PC games and cds always came with paper sleeves: I always took great care when taking the CDs out of the sleeves.,1306368000,4,587,4.297297297297297

3357273,5,B00144H00Y,"Stingray is a great TV show that holds up really well.  It's one of my favorite Stephen J. Cannell shows.  It featured a fascinating man of mystery played by Nick Mancuso.  The show reveals very little about the character.  Which creates a somewhat frustrating dichotomy of loving the mysterious nature of the character while at the same time wanting to know more about the character's past. In other words, you both love it and hate it.

It had a diverse array of storylines featuring some clever ideas.  I especially liked Ray's special Stingray headlight attachment that was used in the ""Ether"" episode.  Which he used to convince people that they weren't being followed.

Ray's ability to step into a variety of roles at the drop of the hat was a bit similar to Jarod in The Pretender.

Another great feature of the show were the wonderful songs created for the show by Mike Post, Stephen Geyer, and others.  Songs like those in the ""Ether"", ""Orange Blossom"", and ""Neniwa"" episodes.

The biggest disappointment, for me, music wise, was that the beautiful rendition of ""I'll Fly Away"" was removed from the ""That Terrible Swift Sword"" episode for the DVD release.",1299283200,2,1165,4.833333333333333

3357275,5,B00144H00Y,"I did check the review before buying this DVD set and former buyers were speaking about the DVD content being compressed. For my part, I didn't see any differences when listeneing to the DVD and I am perfectly satisfied with it's quality. I used to watch this serie when it was originaly on air in the 80's and I enjoyed Stingray very much. Maybe beaucause of the mystery surronding the main character(played by Nick Mancuso) and maybe beacause of the beautiful ""Stingray"" corvette he is driving. Just like in some other show, the vehicule is a""star"" of the show even if it is just a material object. This is an action series of course but the way the scenario was written makes it a little different and fun to watch. When you see the main charachter disapear at the end of an episode, you always think that on the next show you will finally find out who he is and why he is doing all this but.....The DVD case is neat too, all the disc are individually stored in a little pouche are held in the case by a plastic frame. This makes it very easy to retreive the disc and this arrangement  turn the case  to be not too thick but the pouch are loose  within their frame som they might fell if you turn the case while it is open so be careful!
Thank's to the company who made ""Stingray"" available on DVD, for me it's a great buy.

3357276,5,B00144H00Y,"First of all, let me tell you I loved this series when it first aired in late 80s. I always liked the resourcefulness of the main character and wondered if anyone could live off out of favors... and yet be able to help others in need. The DVD set is poor packed and I guess it is so to cope with the low pricing of the set. I don't mind, I just didn't like that the pilot is somewhat a shorter version than the one I remember seeing decades ago.

I will leave the technical details to the other reviewers, which pretty much covers it all.

This series is really good although it was short lived and I think it was a pity. Of all the episodes, *Sometimes you've gotta sing the blues* is my favorite. A bittersweet story with great acting and an outstanding theme song. It is a very sad story about personal sacrifices you are asked to make in life for the greater good of others or the one who cares most to you - ""That's Life. And sometimes you've gotta sing the blues""; and the theme song fits in it marvelously and it goes more or less like this (don't recall the exact lyrics):

""You've been waiting a life time \ even but a lucky break \ hanging on to a lifeline \ that's where you made your first mistake \ Sometimes you've gotta sing the blues \ a little looney goes a long long way \ ... \ Sometimes there's nothing but the blues \ when you got nothing there to loose \ Oh you've gotta sing the blues...""

A few years ago, I contacted the singer of the song to ask if she ever recorded that song and she said no; that that song was recorded only for that particular episode. *A very cool song* as she stated. I wish she had recorded it and I would get it...

A must see series that I highly recommend. It is the *Burn Notice* without the money :)

Enjoy!",1297641600,2,1761,4.119533527696793
3357277,5,B00144H00Y,"For my wife and I, this is one of our favorite TV series of all time. Stingray managed comedy, action, spy motifs, sci-fi, social relevance, romance, and just plain fun all at the same time. Nick Mancuso brought it off with a remarkable charm that sold the show.

I have read recently that the series stopped because Mancuso could not see himself being tied down to a series any longer. Having read many times of Mancuso's quirky and independent slant regarding life and career, I had no trouble believing that to be true. However, its too bad. This was the role of a lifetime for any versatile actor, and looking back, I'll bet he realized that he could have stood a few more years of a quality role such as Ray, compared to some of the weak supporting roles he was stuck with in years thereafter. Like many actors, he probably eschewed the TV bird in the hand feeling that a long string of strong leading roles was within his grasp. And like many actors, he found that future to be ultimately elusive.

The show's concepts of mercenary help for barter, and a supremely mysterious main character, were very different and highly enjoyable. Mancuso's ability to mold himself into many personas ... just as enjoyable. His southern accent? Not so good, but forgivable in view of the hours of entertainment he brought otherwise. LOL

This DVD set is far better than viewing your 20+ year old VHS tapes of the series, but it is not a top quality transfer. It is a Canadian product.

3357281,5,B00144H00Y,"The 1980's action TV to me was Wiseguy, The A Team and Stingray. Stingray, Created by Stephen J Cannell,  was an adventure series, like the A Team. A man who takes a case who the deal that he will ask a favor. His identity was unknown to anyone. The pilot hinted a vietname vet and a P.O.W

The action adventure is nonstop. Think the Lone Ranger with a Stingay auto instead of a horse. Nick Mancuso takes the lead and makes the mysterious Ray an enigma to keep watching.

NBC were idiots in 1986, they moved this show from time slot to time slot instead of giving this show a chance to grow. It lasted only two seasons (25 episodes), but enough for this show to have a cult following

This Mill Creek product has the clearest master recording for 1986 shows. This 10 hours of this show will make you wanting for more.

The powers that be in Hollywood  been remaking shows like the Bionic Woman, Knight Rider, Hawaii Five O and Charlie's Angels, I wish someone would be smart to remake this one. Until then you will enjoy this show on DVD

I actually wanted one episode that was my #1 favorite, ""That Terrible Swift Sword"" (hope I got it right).  To me, the last scene was the best, with Nick looking out onto the harbor, the church hymn ""I'll Fly Away"" playing in the background, while he gets into his car and drives away.  Brings tears to my eyes every time.

So when I heard the ""new"" music - some other hymn or whatever - that the Powers That Be substituted, it ruined the whole thing for me.  Oh sure, it's probably got something to do with copyrights and use of material and blah, blah, blah.  Money is always a BIG DEAL which is why Thirtysomething hasn't come out just yet.

All 24 episodes of the 1986-87 TV series including the two part pilot episode are included for your viewing enjoyment. There is a disclaimer that comes on when each disc is inserted warning of certain anomalies in the quality. I'm not sure why it's on all the discs because other than the pilot episode the quality in my opinion is excellent. You can play the episodes individually or use the play all feature. The video transfers are crisp and clean and the colors are vibrant and sharp. The audio is really good and the opening theme song from Mike Post and the 80's style soundtrack is awesome. The five single sided discs come in a clear standard DVD case with great artwork and detail. The set is well done and Vei should be commended for their efforts.

From series creator Stephen J. Cannell comes one of my favorite television shows of all time ""Stingray"". This series had it all in my opinion and it got cancelled way too soon. Former intelligence specialist ""Stingray"" or Ray as he's called is in the business of helping people out of sticky situations. Ray drives a 1965 Corvette Stingray, he is highly skilled in weapons combat and hand to hand combat and as a former intelligence specialist he can hack into any computer database. The only way to contact him is through a classified add in the newspaper and clients must agree to his terms or he won't meet them. Ray is a specialist and the best at what he does and he can assume the persona of anyone at anytime and make it all seem believable. Ray provides a service to those in need and when the job is done he tells them that they simply owe him a favor. The favor, Ray's form of payment for his expert help is to be repaid when the time comes and those he has helped cannot refuse him. ""Stingray"" benefited from great scripts, solid acting and solid character development each week and it's a shame it ended so soon.

3357300,4,B00144H00Y,"I've been watching Stingray the complete series and it was wild! It was quite a thing for me to adjust to episodes being so clear because the five shows I recorded when the show first came out had awful reception.

I didn't know what so-called anomalies there were that each disk warned about because I saw none of it, and the only jerky motion I saw was when my computer went on its scans. When I halted them, all jerkiness of motion stopped.

I can't understand why those who contacted Ray were so concerned about who he really was, what was his real name, why he did favors for payment, when he'll be back to collect his favor. Who cares! If you tell me your name is the Pillsbury Dough Boy why bother question it? Beats being called ""Hey You"". Who cares why he collects favors instead of money. It's so much cheaper. Who cares what his background is that made him who he is. He accepts my case, that's all that should matter. Why some of the characters seemed relieved that their favors weren't the horror they thought they'd be is mind boggling. Ray should've been trusted a little more since he helped them out of jams.

I loved the writing in all but two episodes. The episode with Jeff Conaway from Taxi playing a self-absorbed actor who was such a jerk running from people trying to kill him, and the episode with the woman writer and her whining sister slowly poisoning her, listening to the horrible writing of that so-called writer typing her schlocky writing and using it as a voice over, was a bitter reminder that sometimes show writers will resort to crap when they have no good ideas because it seems better than no idea at all.

Despite my complaints, I still love my Stingray CD's. I've had no problem with jerkiness of motion unless my scans come on. I got the CD's  in excellent condition and a day earlier than promised.  I love the graphics as soon as a CD is popped in with moving shots of episodes while the theme song that I can never get enough of, plays. I like that you can play a disk's episodes singly or all at once if you want to make a marathon of it. I like the liner notes about Ray's character, and of course, I like Nick Mancuso's pictures.

Ray you'll always be my favorite! Now for the favor I've been waiting to collect on  for years. Move over and let me drive!",1225411200,2,2303,4.364485981308412

3357304,5,B00144H00Y,"This is a great series that was treated very shoddily by the network.  According to ""Adventures in Prime Time:  The Television Programs of Stephen J. Cannell"" by Robert J. Thompson, NBC wanted a light, comedic show, and when Stephen J. Cannell delivered the Stingray pilot, a dark, moody mystery-adventure, the network passed on the series.  However, high ratings for the pilot meant that the network reluctantly ordered eight episodes, thus resulting in Season One of Stingray.  After that, the network tried cancelling the series again, but then needed filler for a dead-end timeslot, and ordered 15 more episodes at the last minute, resulting in Season 2.  Because of how NBC buried the show, it did not survive its third cancellation, and viewers lost out on one of the most innovative, clever, and stylish shows of the 80's.

Nick Mancuso is mesmerizing as Stingray.  He manages to convey a haunted compassion that elevates the character above what could have been a stereotypical womanizing loner, and the glimpses of Stingray's past are fascinating.  Mancuso also does an amazing job at the many undercover guises Ray uses to crack the case (some favourites:  Italian hairdresser, Mexican field worker, surgeon, casting agent, Greek chemist, college student).  Mancuso's only weakness seems to be the fight sequences. Having a martial arts-trained hero was innovative at the time, but the use of stunt men instead of Mancuso was rather obvious. All in all, though, Ray was a complex and charismatic hero whose mysterious past would have remained intriguing for many seasons to come.

The stories were also extremely clever.  The pilot and the first season, especially, were full of complex plots and deep characterization.  The relationship between Ray and the guest stars was given proper depth, and Ray was shown to make mistakes, and have to recover from them.  Season 2 was more uneven, mostly because the shows were ordered at the last minute.  Some of the stories were obviously rushed (The Neniwa, Blood Money), or did not even match the continuity about Ray's past from the first season (Gemini, The First Time is Forever).  But the second season also introduced humour, in such fantastic episodes as Autumn (a parody of film noir) , Caper (a parody of caper movies), and Cry Wolf (where a spoiled movie star drives Ray crazy).  It is a tribute to the versatility both of the premise and Mancuso himself that these espisodes can be so hilarious, and still not undermine the inherent dignity of Ray's purpose.  It is too bad that the network squashed this show before it could fulfill its promise.

Another stylish signature of the show was the embedded ""music video"" in each episode, similar to Miami Vice.  However, the songs were written especially for the show, which sometimes backfired (bad 80's pop is just hideous), but sometimes worked amazingly well.  The songs that still stand up to this day are in ""Ether"", ""Below the Line"", ""Orange Blossom"", ""The Greeter"" (this one moves me to tears), ""Echoes"", and ""Autumn"".  Since I don't have copies of the original broadcasts, I was only made aware of soundtrack substitutions after reading some of the other reviews.  It's too bad, since music contributed greately to the moodiness of the show, but I guess I have to grateful that Stingray made it to DVD at all.

It is truly a shame that this show didn't get the chance it deserved.  Even having only seen a few episodes just once when I was a teenager, Stingray made such an impression on me that I remembered it vividly 20 years later when this set was released.  I am happy to say that it is even better than I remember!  Highly recommended.",1218326400,5,3662,4.912195121951219
3357305,5,B00144H00Y,"I have been waiting for this series to come to DVD for years, checking in every now and then. If you were a fan of the show, it is worth every penny. While I am not a car junkie by nature, this show made my favorite car the 1965 Corvette Stingray... in black of course.",1214179200,,269,3.909090909090909
3357306,5,B00144H00Y,"Would add my favorable review to the others here. The audio/visual quality is good. The liner notes are okay although a little more detail would have been nice. The plastic case is adequate.

The show itself? The interesting thing is that it's an anthology: Ray is the only main character, so you've got an almost anonymous character who can easily be slotted into any number of stories. During the course of the series they did Amerindian supernatural (""The Ninewah""), a technology breakdown (""Playback""), a viral outbreak (""Less Than the Eye Can See""), serial killers, street gangs (""Blood Money""), Bond-style villains (an unnamed villain in ""Abnormal Psych"" who sadly didn't return), psychodramas, political intrigue (""Sometimes You Got To Sing the Blues""), and comedies. The comedies are among the best: check out ""Caper"" (a near-perfect parody of ""Mission: Impossible""), ""Autumn"" (a parody of ""Murder She Wrote""), and ""Cry Wolf"" with a hilariously over-the-top Jeff Conaway as an actor who ropes Ray into a showdown with the Mafia and the Yakuza.

As suits an anthology, Nick Mancuso plays many different roles within the role, able to take on the persona of a surgeon or a revival preacher at the drop of a hat. While good with a gun and martial arts, he's just as capable of getting through to a brainwashed killer just by being persuasive (""Abnormal Psych""). He also displays a photographic memory and the ability to temporarily stop his heart.

The musical scores are good, and each show ends with shots of the production crew taken during the episode.

Overall, highly recommended. Comes across as a bit dated with the 80s clothing styles and computer tech, but as noted elsewhere, it's really a pretty timeless kind of show. Wonder when someone will do a remake in these years of remake-heavy TV revival shows?",1210550400,10,1821,5.0198675496688745

3357308,5,B00144H00Y,"It sounds like an exaggeration but it's true...I've been waiting nearly 20 years to see this series again!

I caught a few episodes on TV as a kid in the 80s and was amazed by it...so different to what else was on TV at the time - yeah, it was an action/adventure/detective kind of series but it was actually intelligent and thoughtful. Unfortunately, because of the TV timeslot, I missed most of the episodes and was desperate to see the repeats - but they never came.

The series just seemed to vanish as mysteriously as it first appeared...very appropriate for Stingray as you'll know if you watch it.

Now, expecting to be let down (as you usually are when re-experiencing childhood memories), I'm finally watching these episodes again and I'm amazed at how good they are.

And, looking back, I see that the unique idea of a hero who deals only in trading favours is one that has influenced me quite a bit over the years as I've grown up.

Nick Mancuso's interpretation of action hero ""Ray"" is full of warmth and humanity, and is surprisingly believable. Reminds me a bit of the depth that Harrison Ford gave to the character of Indiana Jones as compared to the wooden, cardboard-cutout ""heroes"" that came before Raiders of The Lost Ark.

Stingray is not your ordinary throwaway TV series by any means. Look past all the 80's styles/clothing/music and there's a timeless archetypal quality to it all.

If you like Knight Rider, A-Team, Airwolf etc. then here's a series that has all the appeal of those without requiring you to leave your brain at the door.",1209945600,6,1561,4.675182481751825
3357309,5,B00144H00Y,Could hardly believe it when we saw that we could acquire the entire series. The old VHS copies of a few of the shows were just about worn out and could no longer be copied with any detail.,1209340800,,189,4.0
3357310,5,B00144H00Y,"I don't write reviews very often and others have already given helpful comments, so I will try to distill what it is that made this show my favorite of all time.  Ever.

To me, this series combines great acting, good music, interesting story plots, a 1965 Corvette, martial arts action, and just the right touch of poignancy as our mysterious hero, Ray,  helps others without payment except for his client's promise to grant a favor in return.  Often experiencing romantic feelings in the process,  Ray ends up having to leave each adventure behind as he moves on to help someone else, driven by whatever pushes him on in his private quest to be the modern day Robin Hood.  That quality keeps his character from being arrogant or overly macho.  We marvel at what he can accomplish, but feel his self-imposed loneliness.  This makes him just sympathetic enough that while we celebrate his victories, we also admire him in the process.

This show was filmed in 1986, only 15 years after the close of the Vietnam war.  The creators of the show did a good job of tapping into the tragic past of that war and Ray's mysterious connection to it.  As a result of whatever the character experienced in 'Nam, it continues to drive him onward to rescue and help people out of jams.  The result is always a generous helping of action and suspense.

I remember getting hooked on this show when it came out.  By then, a few episodes had run, but I figured it would last forever, so I taped some episodes and then taped over them with something else.  To my horror, I realized when the show stopped that I had nothing to re-watch.  For an all too short time, our local TV station ran rebroadcasts in the wee hours of the morning in 1991 after late night updates on the Gulf War.  I would set my VCR to try to catch some of those; I ended up with a few complete episodes and a few half-episodes, hanging on to them like a starving man, wating and waiting for someone to finally release the series.

Now, after 22 years, it has finally happened.  The complete set is here and life is good.

If you know this show, you, like me, probably already have your copy.  If you don't know this show - this would be one worth buying.  It will not disappoint.  Bear in mind that when the show was made, we were just getting into computers, so their use will appear a little dated.  Otherwise, the show is timeless and even better than I remember it.",1209254400,8,2421,4.437641723356009
