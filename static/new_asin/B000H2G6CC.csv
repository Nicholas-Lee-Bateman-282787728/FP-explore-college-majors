2625862,1,B000H2G6CC,"this is horribly compressed, as i expected, but also there is a horrible distortion at the bottom of the image almost every time theres a fast cut from one scene to the next.  its a bunch of white lines that ive never seen at the bottom of anything commercially produced.  oh well netflix has the larger box set for rent...guess ill just have to copy those to make up for my horrid regrettable purchase.

also this defect shows up on my PC and DVD player...so im pretty sure its not my hardware generating it.",1175472000,8,509,4.3936170212765955
8136017,4,B000H2G6CC,"While I was skeptical finding this series for under $20, I was pleasantly surprised. Before buying it I read some of the other reviews accusing the seller of this item as distributing bootlegs but if this is one, I honestly can't tell. My only issue is my XBOX ONE won't play two of the discs but I've had this issue with other dvds and I'm convinced its an issue with the console.",1485043200,,381,4.305555555555555
8136018,1,B000H2G6CC,"Yes, it is much cheaper.  No, it is not worth it.  This version is a rip-off.  If you buy it, you will agree that the money would have been much better spent by throwing it into wishing wells or being burned to create warmth in the winter.",1399075200,,239,4.042553191489362
8136019,5,B000H2G6CC,"Berserk is a great anime. It's got great animation, cool music, great characters and voicing, great story, and tons of action and drama. My only beef with Berserk is the ending, or lack thereof. The 1st episode is actually the last in chronological order. There is a huge gap between the last two chronological episodes and no conclusion. I heard that the manga goes farther, but I never could get into reading manga. I really do like Berserk and recommend it to anime fans, but there is no ending and the price that I'm seeing for it is insane. Don't pay more than $20 for it. You can probably find it for that much.",1353974400,,617,4.421052631578948
8136020,4,B000H2G6CC,"This is one of the greatest anime ever made. The ending does leave you hanging, but the manga is still running so there would be no ending no matter what. Trust me, this is the best Berserk arc anyway, as the tone is completely different and is about war and comrades, whereas afterwards its more about fighting monsters and feels like a typical shonen, albeit with mega graphic sex and violence and ultra-detailed artwork.

The bootleg itself is pretty good. The cover isn't great to look at and the discs use artwork from the manga. They are rips of the official release downsized to 3 discs and are not perfect, but still pretty nice picture and audio. You really should buy the official release. A must buy anime either way.",1283904000,,728,4.6
8136021,5,B000H2G6CC,"the quality isn't the greatest, but i was so caught up in the storyline and what was happening, i didn't care!!
for you people who havn't seen this. i definitely recommend this!
if you like sword battling, and epic heroes, you would love the show.
If you want great quality then yes you might want the box set, but it only improves slightly, unless i got a really good copy.
thats up for you to decide, but this is definitely an anime you don't want to miss. lastly everyone i showed this anime to thought it was amazing and had to go buy it.  so you decide if you want to watch cause if you watch it you will become a fan; Guaranteed.",1205884800,,635,4.162601626016261
8136022,1,B000H2G6CC,shame on those chinese rippers! buy from the U.S. distributor. If you don't they don't make money and we don't get anime.,1198886400,9,121,4.545454545454546
8136023,5,B000H2G6CC,"Great series.

I played the Sega Dreamcast spin off and was fasinated by the story elements I read from a link on the main menu. Then I checked out the series was very impressed.

For those of you who dislike the ending, know that the story was supposed to continue as an animated series but was never made. The manga is almost word-for-word identical to the animated series and goes well past the ending from this boxed set. If you didn't like how it ended, check out the manga.",1197849600,,479,4.370786516853933
8136024,5,B000H2G6CC,"Personally, I prefer the three-disc set. I didn't experience much degradation in quality, and it's a convenient advantage in a storage situation. I suppose it's a matter of personal preference, however, since I've compacted my anime collection to include only the three-disc sets of each 20+ episode series.

About ""Berserk"" itself, it's a wonderful, classic anime series, and everyone should watch it at least once. However, I would not recommend it for younger viewers, since the subject matter is a bit more ""adult"". In all, however, an awesome storyline, and good character connections. :)",1193184000,3,593,5.308510638297872
8136025,5,B000H2G6CC,"Berserk....This anime is an older one so do not expect fabulous animation and artwork, but for its time the animation, etc. is quite good. The story is very well written and the characters fabulously developed.

This series is about Guts...an orphan with a jaded past...finding refuge with The Band of the Hawk, a large band of mercenaries with a glory bound leader, Griffith. Griffith takes Guts under his wing...pardon the pun...and tries to soothe the heartache that he has from what has happened in his past.

There is fighting with lots ann lots of blood. There is enough blood to be a Quentin Tarantino film.:) The music is perfect for the scenes. Love and romance are also to be found. To me, the only flaw is the ending. The end is very DARK and HORRIBLE. If you are looking a for a nice, happy ending you might as well not even watch this one. To put it simple...the one you thought was bad is good and the one you thought was good is bad.

This is over all a great series. ENJOY",1176768000,,988,4.417582417582418
8136026,5,B000H2G6CC,"I understand the previous reviewer's comments regarding the quality of this product, as I bought the exact same copy a few years ago.  Fact is, it's basically a dollar per episode for this series, and when the quality matches at least what used to be on Cartoon Network's Toonami shows, I say it's one hundred percent worth it.  Since he gave no real review of the actual show, I felt a little obligated to reset the ""stars"" review so that the day-to-day anime fan with a lower budget wouldn't miss this find.

When I first bought this show, I had done it on a whim.  I used to own a Sega Dreamcast and had bought the game tie-in, but was less than impressed with it and soon tossed it aside.  So garnering what I could from what little gameplay and story I had seen, I figured the series itself must be a pretty cool hack-and-slash action series that could pass the time until I had the rest of the Tenchi series.  I have never been so happy to be wrong in my life.

True enough, the series does have excellent action, enough to draw you in and keep you interested for the first few episodes.  However it is the story and character depth that will lock you in for the long-haul.  As the series progresses, the story evolves into something more than an action title, bring in elements of mystery, comedy, political intrigue and deception, love and romance, drama, horror, and even rounds a few corners as a coming-of-age tale.  The animation is such that while appearing to modern anime fans to be outdated, it still delivers plenty of pinache in every aspect of its performance.  More important to me than anything else is that the animation should fit the series, and the animation in this one most definitely does.

I really don't want to say much about the plot, because there are a lot of twists and turns and the complexity of each bring a depth to the series that I have never seen in another show (without it becoming either convoluted or just plain philosophically and spiritually confusing).  It's definitely one for the adults, despite the hero with the giant sword that younger anime fans might appreciate, the moral code in this series is much closer to a soldier's than any chivalrous knight.

Kill or be killed, this series delivers and changed my perspective on what anime should be, and raised the bar considerably for what I am willing to watch anymore.  I'm not saying a comedy or adventure flick/series should be overlooked because of this series, but it'll definitely make you question what you're watching now.  If you've got doubts, he it's only a dollar an episode so it's still close to if not cheaper than a 4-episode volume of some other big-name show.

I'll end with this because I think it's worth noting, every person I have brought this series up with has been completely clueless about it.  After all, I don't believe it's ever been ""brought over,"" despite the excellent voice acting and quality story.  That being said, every person I forced to watch it now counts it among their favorites, if not their absolute favorite, which is the case with me.  This series is beyond anything else I've seen OVA-wise, and if you're a fan who's more concerned with the story than the presentation of the animation, I highly recommend this version.  It'll at the very least save you a few bucks over the higher-quality, yet higher-priced versions of the same show.",1176508800,6,3384,4.625418060200669
