There are many new twists in saga like some of your favorite villans returning.  I recomend this saga to everyone who likes Yu Yu Hakusho",1139097600,,301,4.321428571428571
2384099,3,B000AARKT4,"Ok. Now I was really entertained after the Spirit Detective Saga and the Dark Tournament saga was just great. I had high expectations for this one that was coming out. Sadly......I was let down.

Good things:

1. action and animations was always great.

2. music is always very good.

3. some scenes are very cool despite botched story.

Bad things:

1. crappy story: first thing, Toguro was the ultimate villain right? He was supposed to be. But apparently on this whack Spirit Class crap he is only a B+! WHAT THE HECK! Another thing, how can a person want to destroy all humanity after seeing only ONE little act of cruelty. What the heck is with Yusuke always coming back?

2. some characters are just weird: mainly Sensui's seven. Some of them were cool (like Sniper for instance) but the Gatekeeper (bordering on homosexuality) just dampened my spirits.

3. the show went too long: they should have ended it in the Dark Tournament Saga and avoided all of thsi failure.

Being a YYH fan I had to like it but alot disappointed me. Unless u are a hardcore YYH fan, do not get this.",1133654400,2,1084,4.546391752577319

8077424,4,B000AARKT4,As a series YU YU Hakusho is one of my favorites but it is a long series while this set is nice there is now 4 season sets that can be bougt for about $15-$20 the product itself though is fairly good with each disk having its own cd holder as opposed to those slots in the lower quality series (containers),1464566400,,306,4.032786885245901

8077428,5,B000AARKT4,"My daughter search for this video set for over a year to complete her Yu Yu Hakusho collection.  Vendors would take the order, inform her that it was backordered,and then cancel the order altogether.  The Amazon seller came through,and my daughter is delighted with the videos.",1251072000,2,277,5.0
8077429,5,B000AARKT4,"This season was better than the Spirit Detective Saga for many reasons...
Way better fighting
A way better villian
You Understand Yuske better
It is a better story plot",1197590400,,168,4.827586206896552
8077430,5,B000AARKT4,"This is the very first yu yu hakusho saga ive seen and owned. I think its pretty good. This saga takes place after the dark tournement. In this saga kuwabara gets new powers,genkai makes her appearance,a deman awakens in yuskae,and a certain pacifier comes out. The storyline is,after the dark tournement people start getting special powers in the town thats name escapes me,yuskae lives there. A former spirit detective recriuts five of them and a demon named gatekeeper(uggg!!!)creepy to open a hole to demon world. There names are spiper,gamemaster,gourmet,docter and seaman. Sniper can shoot any thing at you and when he marks you with his bullzeye imprint he can never miss. Gamemaster can turn any game into game into reality. Gourmet can absorb anothers power. Docter can perform amazing precedues even to himself meaning he can cure anything,he can attatch a limb back and you would think he'd do good. Seaman who turns good,can take water and a drop of his blood and create water monsters. Overall 5 stars for this set,if you're a yu yu hakusho fan or an anime fan I reccomend this set. But if you're new to yu yu hakusho than I suggest seeing everything before this,unless you just want to see this first then go for it.",1185321600,,1230,4.806603773584905
8077431,5,B000AARKT4,"Yu Yu Hakusho has always been a favorite anime series of mine. All I can say about the Chapter Black Saga is that it made me want more and more of Yu Yu Hakusho. It seems like each saga gets better and better. Each saga is great in its own way, but this saga deals with some strong serious issues and not only that, but it leaves you wondering what will happen next and will Yu Yu Hakusho be able to save his world in time. All the characters are great and still going strong in this saga, and the new villian is not bad his self. Plus, I love that these are uncut episodes, and not the edited ones that use to come on Cartoon Network. Yu Yu Hakusho is one of the best animes that I have seen and I hope to watch it over and over again!",1176940800,4,736,3.9133333333333336
8077432,5,B000AARKT4,"Yu Yu Hakusho took the japanese world by storm, the manga became a popular action comic series. Like all great manga it was transferred to television as Anime and during it's transformation has became a very popular Anime sensation around the world. I have no doubt in my mind that the Chapter Black saga is one of it's bests, to be sure read on and find out.

Plot: The end of the Dark Tournament has come and our hero Yusuke Urameshi is probaley looking forward to time without cases. As he begins to pick up his life where he left off, a strange young man challanges him to a fight. Yusuke being the tough, dumb kid we know him to be unhesistantly accepts his challanges. However when his opponent uses Spirit Energy and traps Yusuke, these three young men kidnap him. Kuwabara, Karama, Hiei, and Botan all unite to rescue him, facing these men in their territory. Eventually it is revealed that Genki is behind all that is happened teaching Yusuke and the rest about this new power and how many new people their are with spirit energy. This leads to a new case where Yusuke and his friends are put on assignment by Koenma to stop a force of people trying to form a Gateway from the Demon World to the Human World to destroy and kill everybody. These men turn out to be Sensui, Itzuki, Sniper, Gourmet, Seaman, Gamemaster, and Doctor now going through Yusuke and his friends must fight each one of the seven to make sure the human world is safe, will Yusuke and his friends save the world?

What i love about this saga is the amount of plot twists, and every thing at stake surrounded Yusuke's defeat. When you begin watching you are 100% sure the good guys are gonna win, but as it goes on it begins to see more unlikely as the time keeps decreasing and the enemys keep getting stronger. When it appears in your mind what could happen if Yusuke loses you begin to become even more hooked than before. Also enjoyible is Sensui's personality.

This is a great saga and is very entertaining, if you are a fan of Yu Yu Hakusho or Anime in general do not hesistate buy now!!!",1151280000,13,2074,4.424083769633508
8077433,5,B000AARKT4,"Okay the spirit detective arc is good, the dark tournament arc is great and this arc is amazing. Simply put: the greatest arc in any show i've ever seen. The story is great and the characters are extermely interesting.

  I recommened this to any anime fan and to anyone in general.",1139788800,2,282,4.490196078431373
