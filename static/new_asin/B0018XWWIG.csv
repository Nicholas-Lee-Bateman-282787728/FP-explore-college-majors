I've watched this documentary maybe 10 times; it's one of the few I saw several times in the theater when it was released; I bought the DVD soon afterwards. To me it never gets old.

Guerin (the director) spent several years filming this and it shows. Almost every shot, scene, dialogue, character is moving in one way or another.

An absolute masterpiece in my opinion.",1295481600,2,489,4.879518072289157
