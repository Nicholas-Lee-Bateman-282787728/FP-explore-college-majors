I Heart U stars and is directed by Billy Gaberina. It also stars Raine Brown. The film centers around Billy and Raine being your somewhat typical married couple who have run into a rut. Raine runs a catering company that is the center of her life and Billy is a building inspector engineer. They never have time for each other because of work and other extracurricular activities. Essentially they are both serial killers and are oblivious that the other is a psychotic killer. The film's humor comes from the fact that they are almost competing with one another with the police and media attention and the stress of this starts spilling over into their home lives but again they think it's because of the stress from their jobs. A lot of heart (no pun intended) went into this film and it is a micro budget film so be warned that this film won't have Hollywood level effects and acting. Still it is highly effective and entertaining. The special effects are very good and the production value is top notch. The film is a great example of how to do more with less and get the maximum out of your cast and crew. Well worth seeing especially if you are a fan of micro budget cinema.",1394755200,,1220,4.575342465753424
8628276,4,B00GX7WLP6,"Dont be fooled by its title; I HEART U is not a sappy rom-com, nor is it a mushy chick-flick.  On the contrary, this low-budget gem is a horror-comedy with lots of wit, gore, and heart.  And what better day to post this review than on Valentines Day?  If you're looking for a fun flick to watch with your loved one tonight, snatch this one up and give it a look.

Ok, first the disclaimer:  this is a very low-budget flick, so if that is a turn-off, then don't check this out.  But if you can look past it, you're in for a real treat.  This is a well-written, well-crafted film that will leave you smiling as the credits roll.

I HEART U is shot pretty well and looks good overall.  The production team does a good job of utilizing the budget they have, which as I mentioned isn't much.  The special effects are really good for low-budget, and theres plenty of gore and blood flowing throughout the film.  The acting, unfortunately, is where this film really lacks, although I have seen worse.  Several of the characters deliver their lines as if they're reading from cue-cards, which makes me cringe to even think about.

But with that aside, the story is very funny and smartly written.  A few lines of dialogue stand out as being forced (specifically a couple of the jokes), but otherwise its ok.  I particularly like the pace at which the plot unfolds; it is perfect.  And the ending fits the story like a glovenot to mention its pretty danged funny at the same time.

I HEART U is a big win for me, and it will make the perfect companion piece to a Valentines evening with your sweetheart.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1392336000,2,1646,4.394039735099338
