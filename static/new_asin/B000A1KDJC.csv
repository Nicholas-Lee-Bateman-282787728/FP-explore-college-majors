2350041,3,B000A1KDJC,"I gave this video 3 stars, because Master Tsai does make some valid points. I feel this video is too quick paced and too short for the amount of money you pay for it. I have his 2 videos and basically it shows you where to aim for the weak parts of the attacker and how to try to get away. Master Tsai deomonstrates on his students, which is really funny to watch! It is very good for a laugh. Sorry Master Tsai, but you really need to add more drills into the video to make it much better.",1125014400,,490,3.95959595959596

8072251,5,B000A1KDJC,"The series is perfect for predator proofing anyone, and has come in handy for me about 2 or three times in my life since 1998. I think it would also be the perfect way to bully proof youngsters who have to deal with America's public education system.",1334188800,,250,4.340425531914893
8072252,5,B000A1KDJC,"I have trained in Judo, Hapkido, and Aikido and find Master Tsai's self-defense tactics more practical, easy to learn, require limited training time, and definitly effective. An excellent insurance policy if you or a loved one ever need to defend yourselves.",1309651200,,258,5.317073170731708
8072253,5,B000A1KDJC,excellent and timely service!!,1280102400,,30,6.75
8072254,5,B000A1KDJC,I bought the tapes several years ago and just rewatched them tonight. I'm much more experienced now but the tapes are good to remind you not to try and get too fancy in a street fight or defending yourself and stick to basics and especially his emphasis on attacking vital areas.,1270944000,,279,4.490196078431373
8072255,5,B000A1KDJC,"Master Tsai is terrific!
If you learn and perfect only 2 or 3 of the techniques he shows you, it can save your life.
You can't watch it once and be ready to use these techniques.  You have to review them on a regular basis and practice.  So, if a life threatening situation does arise you can just REACT and not think.
His whole emphasis is ""reacting"" because in a life threatening situation we're too scared to ""think"". It's made for us ""regular"" people.",1196467200,,455,4.404761904761905
8072256,5,B000A1KDJC,I have studied Karate for years.  My daughter had no interest in learning.  I had her watch the video to at least get familiar with a couple of usable techniques.  She had a time that she needed to defend herself & was able to come out alright.  Thank you for your fine video it allowed me to PREDATOR PROOF my daughter. 5 stars is to few for what Master Tsai has offered.  I have had several other young ladies watch.,1194134400,,418,4.175
8072257,5,B000A1KDJC,"I have studied Karate. My daughter has no interest in martial arts so I pressured her into watching this video.

I stressed that if she picked up ONE technique it could save her life.  In fact she did have an incident that she used that ONE technique & it saved her many problems. She has since gone on to travel in several other countries & I feel much better knowing that she has been ""PREADATOR PROOFED"".

This video is a must for ""PREDATOR-PROOFING"" any teenage girl.
It is worth a look. Master Tsai gives simple moves that will work in the real world.  I have ""PREDATOR-PROOFED"" several other young ladies since then using Master Tsai's video.",1192838400,2,648,4.560344827586207
