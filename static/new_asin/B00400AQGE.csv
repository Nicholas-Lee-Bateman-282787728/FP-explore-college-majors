8411509,5,B00400AQGE,"I saw this movie, and thought it was very original and entertaining!  It also has a well told story that really all comes together in the end.  It is a really sweet story.  I think both 20 something males and females can both relate to this movie and enjoy it!",1292025600,4,260,4.16
8411510,4,B00400AQGE,"I saw this film at it's premier at Cinequest film festival in San Jose. In its presentation I thought it was akin to ""Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist"". The 3 main actors did a very good job, the script was well-paced, the story fun and engaging. The sound track was also good, if memory serves me right. We had the privilege of getting all three actors, the director and the writer on stage afterward. The most astonishing things are that this was (1) the first feature length film for all 3 actors, (2) the first feature length film for the director, (3) the first film for the script writer, and (4) it was filmed in 10 or 11 days! Keep these facts in mind when you see - it will add to your appreciation.",1290816000,4,709,4.298507462686567
8411511,5,B00400AQGE,"I saw this film at a screening before its DVD release.  At first glance this is one of those road-trip buddy films where everything happens over the period of one crazy night.  But at its core, this film is SO much more!  This is a SMART, sharp and savvy comedy about the deep holes people (not merely women) will dig for themselves to be in or stay in relationships.  And it's also about growing up enough to see that you're in that hole and need to get out.

Acting and directing are both solid and consistent, with charismatic leads and hilarious secondary players.

This is a cult hit waiting to happen.  I'd jump on board now and say you saw it first!",1290038400,4,656,4.327868852459017
8411512,5,B00400AQGE,"If you're a woman, then you can definitely relate to this movie! Especially if you've ever been crazy over a man. It took me back to some wild times with exes. The movie pokes fun @ relationships and it helped me find a little closure in some past relationships of my own. Wonderful movie!",1287014400,4,289,4.37037037037037
