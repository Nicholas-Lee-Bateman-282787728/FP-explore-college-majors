2116814,5,B0002S65X6,"The story of locating the Bismark seemed overshadowed by the story of its destructive powers and its destruction, not to mention an apparent death of loved of an expeditionary of this adventure. I believe it was the son of Dr. Ballard. You have my most sincere condolences for your tragic loss. From a historical perspective it was well done. The interviews of those taking part in its final moments made the story come alive. The ships themselves were as lifeless monsters and the crew as the blood that pushed them along. The story too, separated them this way. The editors in every way tried to keep any gore or other horrific scenes out of the film but I found one that slipped through. Somewhere towards the part where the Bismark was to get its final death blow, a few frames seemed to have been missed as they didn't appear to belong to anything that was going on at the time. The scene was one of a man whose head, torso and right arm were raised in terror as he was swept under a ship. This could only have been when the HMS Dortsetshire sped away at was reported as a German U-Boat sighting. It was 0:35 minutes into the clip as the torpedoes hit the water. Watching the few frames in slow motion was a dreadful sight. Other than that it was an interesting documentary.",1313366400,4,1279,4.446808510638298
2116815,4,B0002S65X6,"I thoroughly enjoyed this National Geographic special the highlights Robert Ballard's search for the final resting place of the German WWII battleship, Bismarck.  This magnificent and deadly ship sailed into history on its maiden voyage during the spring of 1942.  It gained legendary status when it sank the Royal Navy battlecruiser HMS Hood.  It's legend was then sealed when the vast majority of Royal Navy ships were given orders to seek out and destroy the Bismarck before it could break out into the Atlantic and harass allied shipping there.

It is believed to have been the most powerful, and most technologically advanced warship of its day.

This National Geographic special tells the history of this ship in tandem with the telling of Ballard's search for its resting place.  Robert Ballard gained international fame when we discovered the resting place of the Titanic, and he then turned his sights on the Bismarck.

The narration is good, and the historical footage of the Bismarck and Royal Navy ships add greatly to the telling of the story.  Without that, the show would have little more to use than hours and hours of footage of muddy, soft sediment some 3-4 miles down in the North Atlantic, punctuated by the discovery of the ship.

Well worth watching for anyone with an interest in military history, or history in general.

4 solid stars.  I'm glad I watched it.",1287532800,3,1383,4.918103448275862

--This film is dedicated to someone who I believe is Dr Ballards son, Todd.
I believe his son is in this footage, assiting in the survey for the Bismark.

--Dr Ballard, Im sorry for your loss. I hope it finds a place in your heart that you shared your work with your son, and its preserved on film forever, on such a historical challenge.

The mix of historical footage, interviews with the remaining survivors of WWII that took part, well done folks!!",1274054400,10,546,4.608247422680412

2116819,5,B0002S65X6,"I have developed a keen interest in WW11 Naval Battles and to hear first hand accounts puts me right amongst it.  Those guys gave it and had to take it right to the bitter end, no matter what their beliefs or country of origin.  The bitter courage experienced and to what end - has been displayed brilliantly by Robert Ballard in his quest to successfully locate the wreck of the Bismark and the wrecks in the Pacific. These are brilliant accounts which should never be foregotten.",1219449600,2,481,4.5813953488372094
2116820,4,B0002S65X6,"There are two worth-talking stories of German warships in World War II. One is the Admiral Graf Spee and the other is the Bismarck, pride of the German Navy.

Just like the Titanic, the mighty battleship Bismarck, built secretly, took a one-way ticket in his maiden voyage. Both ships are both found by Dr. Robert Ballard later thanking to modern equipments. The mission of the Bismarck was to blockade the British. After he sank the HMS Hood in a pretty short time, it caused a tremendous shock to the British and the Royal Navy was anxiously trying any way possible to sink him.

The style is similar to the DVD ""The Battle of Midway"" released by NG. Documentaries, interviews with survivors in that battle, and the progress of searching the sunken Bismarck interweave through this film. The going is smooth without redundancy.

I recommend this film to people who are interested in WW II history and battleships. If you like ""The Battle of Midway"" and ""The Lost Fleet of Guadalcanal"", both released by NG, you would like this, too.

It is to my surprise that no one has reviewed this DVD. I think it deserves better and so I wrote the first review of it.",1169683200,32,1157,4.6292682926829265
2116831,4,B0002S65X6,"I really Like this Documentary - but I'll start with my dislikes about it.
Bob Ballard used 3 Transponders at the bottom of the Atlantic - to help locate the Bismarck - but - - the documentary does Not clarify if they were disposable - or retrievable.
They made clear in the beginning part - that they started this hunt with 4 Different locations of where this ship sank - yet - they never say if any of them were correct. - And - the whole point of this documentary - is to Find, Located and pinpoint the Bismarck's location - yet - they Never share this with us. - Sure there's an 'interactive map' - but they Never give its Longitude and Latitude (although I Wouldn't understand them - I think it should be included.
Many years ago (I'm writing this in 2016) I saw a documentary - about finding the Bismarck - and I'm confident/certain - they determined it slid Down a large hill/mountain - to it's location. - But - this one mentions nothing about that.
Otherwise - this is a really cool story - and I like how they flash back and forth to it's creation - the battle - sinking - its mysteries.
Also - some rare interviews with people who were ON these ships!!
As for Bob Ballard - once you've found the Titanic & Bismarck - what's left?
Running time - about 52 minutes.
A Fascinating tale (or 'Tales') - well done (just want some more details); Scott M.",1452384000,,1357,4.3046875
2116832,5,B0002S65X6,Sieg Heil!  Ballard is always interesting.  Gives a good summary of the disaster of the sinking of the Bismark.  At least the Germans gave the damned Limies a good run for their money.,1441324800,,184,4.515151515151516

2116834,5,B0002S65X6,"The fate of the Bismarck, was both tragic, and strategically, and tactically necessary.  If the british fleet had not found her, and sunk her, she could have done considerable damage, to british merchant shipping.  It must be mentioned that Admiral Lutjens helped the british out, with his long messages to Germany.  But in truth, the mission of the Bismarck was doomed right from its beginnings.  Had she been able to unite with the Scharnhorst, and Gniesenau, they would have presented the british fleet with a formidable enemy force.  But it never happened, and in the process, a lot of german sailors died for their country.  These casualties, do not take into account the casualties suffered by HMS Hood, when she was sunk by Bismarck.  This dvd is well worth getting, just for the historical footage alone.

2116851,4,B0002S65X6,"The 48 minute documentary, SEARCH FOR BATTLESHIP BISMARCK is a late episode (#143) in the National Geographic Explorers series that originally aired in 1989. Narrator is Richard Kiley.

Germany's renowned Bismarck, the largest ship of its class, was sent to the bottom either by shell or by design, on 5/27/41, after it sunk HMS Hood and was aggressively pursued by a British fleet. A two day fight against overwhelming numbers ended when Bismarck slipped under the surface, taking with it some 2,200 lives.

Robert Ballard, who had previously located the Titanic in 1985, found the warship's grave on 6/8/89. It sits upright, nearly five miles below the surface and about 400 miles west of Brest, France. On its way to the bottom, Bismarck struck an extinct underwater volcano, slid down this 3,300 foot mountain and came to rest 2/3rds of the way down its side.

There's evidence that Bismarck was scuttled after sustaining a massive artillery and torpedo barrage (surviving crew statements suggest that's what happened), but there's also no absolute proof of this. To avoid salvage operations, Ballard never revealed the wreck site's location, yet there have been subsequent successful expeditions, including one filmed by James Cameron called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/EXPEDITION-BISMARCK/dp/B0000844IH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">EXPEDITION: BISMARCK</a>&nbsp;(2002).",1409011200,2,1420,5.985221674876847

Two stories are told simultaneously:  one story depicts the launching of the Bismarck, its battle with the HMS Hood, and the Royal Navy's search and subsequent sinking of the Bismarck; the other story portrays Bob Ballard's search for this famous German battleship (Ballard found the luxury liner Titanic in 1985).  Interviews with the survivors of the Hood and Bismarck are included as well as animated maps showing the course of the battle between the Royal Navy and the Bismarck.
