517318,5,6302800897,"Some day, I'm going to compile a list of movies to watch when you're bored.  The list will include Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest,"" ""The Godfather,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" and Otto  Perminger's ""Anatomy of a Murder.""
The only thing I can think  to say about this movie is that it is wildly entertaining all throughout.  No words can accurately explain the powerful driving force behind such a  movie; perhaps it's the adreneline rush you get from watching the courtroom  scenes, or maybe it's the collection of superb actors, or maybe it's the  fact that each scene was meticulously devised and constructed in the mind  of Perminger (which I'm sure I'm spelling incorrectly) after reading the  book.  I myself have not and maybe I should, but  I'm sure that its content  is almost identical.
In any case, it is realistic and incredibly  well-done.",945216000,5,852,4.874125874125874
517319,5,6302800897,"James Stewart at his best.  With a strong assist from George C. Scott, and aided by Otto Perminger's cagey direction, Stewart hoists a long movie on his thin shoulders and carries it home.  Forget ""It's a Wonderful  Life"" and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"", Stewart really  came into his own as an actor in late middle age, with his morally  compromised and sometimes disturbing characters here and in his three best  Hitchcock collaborations, ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"", and  ""Rope.""",940550400,,482,5.102564102564102
517320,2,6302800897,"With the lone exception of ""Laura,"" (which was really based on another director's vision), Otto Preminger excercises in all of his films  an infuriatingly self-indulgant, pretentious, clumsy directorial style.  This grossly overlong, overblown, and over-praised melodrama is no  exception. With no sense of either incisiveness or cohesion, the issues  raised often seem to steer uncertainly between social comment and tabloid  sensation; thus, not standing a firm ground in either, one is left with a  puzzlement over just what the film is trying to say? Indeed, one suspects  that here Preminger is playing the yellow journalist. He sees to it that  the so-called ""controversial words"" are repeated endlessly and  reduntantly, to make sure all the world gets the idea that this film is  some kind of milestone; and to obscure the plot inadequacies. A talented  cast is also left floundering. Stewart was so commonly identified as the  ""All-American boy"", that directors often took delight in casting  him in ""daring"" parts. That is certainly the case here, as the  role does not give him room to display all of his talents; but rather to  play the box-office draw. Even so, he survives the project better than  Scott, whose performance--though important to him as a career move--is  overblown. Really, the effort is there--all actors pull their weight--but  the equivocal treatment often gives no direction. If you don't give a damn  about the narrative line, then the performances may entertain solidly for a  while; but best do it on a lazy weekend night!",918432000,10,1558,5.180722891566265

517403,5,6302800897,"If you want a perfect example of a movie for adults, this is it. Superb cast, great script and a director at the top of his form. Every single actor in this film turns in a first-rate performance. James Stewart, who is always good, is perfect in his role as a shrewd country lawyer. Lee Remick is amazing as the slutty wife of Army officer Ben Gazara, who doesn't miss a beat as Remick's hot-tempered husband. The supporting cast, led by Arthur O'Connell (as Stewart's alcoholic sidekick), and George C. Scott as a tough, ambitious prosecutor, are equally fine. Duke Ellington's score is classic, as are Sam Leavitt's cinematography and Boris Leven's production design. Wendell Mayes's superb script, adapted from Robert Travers' novel, is one of the best of all time. This film is a winner on all levels, one of the best movies ever. Kudos to Saul Bass's titles and movie poster. If you're a cinephile, don't miss this one. I'm not a huge Otto Preminger fan, but I love this film.

517407,5,6302800897,"One would suspect a film about a small town murder with a rather small cast to be a simple and straightforward story, yet Anatomy of a Murder is anything but simple. The story and the conflicting moralities on display still have viewers 50 years later debating what really happened.

As one commenter noted, this is based on a true story, and that is undoubtedly the reason that some people are confused or dissatisfied with the ending. Real life often doesn't tie things up in the neat little packages that many movies and most movie viewers like.

The cast and their performances are top notch, and that is what makes this movie the classic it has become. While the story is intricate and interesting, it really is secondary to just sitting back to watch a great team of acting talent put their best work on display.

For those of you who still can't figure it out and don't get it ... BEWARE SPOILER!!!! LOL The husband was guilty. His explanation in his defense was a sham. The wife helped him get away with it. The defense lawyer suspected this all along, but it was his job to give the man a defense. He was sure of it at the end. The couple moved away immediately after the acquittal and left the defense attorney stuck for his bill. The couple was completely amoral.",1508976000,3,1274,4.5064935064935066

517429,4,6302800897,"Otto Preminger had a degree in law from the University of Vienna, and one of the ""special features"" that accompanies this Criterion issue of ""Anatomy of a Murder"" would have us believe that the movie represents a tribute to the American legal processes that he came to admire as he got to know America as a resident before World War 2.  Maybe, but it's an odd and interesting tribute if that's the case, though it isn't a satirical or cynical one.  It does, however, make quite clear that legal processes, carried out in good faith, are one thing and that the determination of truth might be quite another.  Up in Thunder Bay, in the upper peninsula of Michigan, struggling attorney Paul Biegler (James Stewart) undertakes to defend a soldier, Frederick Mannion (Ben Gazzara), from a murder charge following his killing (not disputed) of a man who, his wife claims, raped her.  The young Lee Remick plays Laura Mannion, the wife, and prosecution is led by a local DA (Brooks West), assisted by the Lansing MI hotshot, Claude Dancer (George C. Scott).  Most of the action takes place in the courtroom, presided over by Judge Weaver, played by Joseph N. Welch only about five years after his famous takedown of Senator Joe McCarthy, in the famous hearings in which the Senator was on a witch hunt for Communists in the US Army.  Welch plays Weaver as a wry, humorous, fair, and realistic man, who makes sure that the trial is conducted with appropriate attention to standard procedures.

Two things are interesting: First of all, though the jury reaches a verdict, it's not at all clear that the truth has been told about the murder.  The fact of the killing is not in dispute, but Biegler defends Mannion on an insanity defense of a rather specific kind.  As the movie goes on, though, the audience might come to doubt whether Laura was indeed raped (although that possibility is never foreclosed) and whether the Mannion marriage is as the the couple represent it as being.  Both Mannions are opaque creatures, and the movie shows clearly that legal processes are blunt instruments for getting beneath the surface of human opacity.  Are they acting parts in accordance with what they wish for as the outcome of the trial?  It's certainly a possibility, but they have a story that's coherent, and they stick to it.  They are not the only actors, though.  The movie also makes clear that, for all the formality of legal procedure, both defense and prosecution lawyers are not above histrionic presentation themselves.  James Stewart deploys a number of ""characters"" in the course of his examination and cross-examination, and he does so with gusto.  George C. Scott has less opportunity, but he has his big moments too.  This doesn't make the trial a charade, but it does make it drama -- and it's very different drama from the popular Perry Mason courtroom drama of the time.  Mason was always coolly forensic, and he always got at the truth, including the truths hidden in men's and women's hearts.  In ""Anatomy,"" Judge Weaver insists on a decent respect for evidence and relevance, for all the posturing in his court, and no one can say for sure that justice isn't done -- or, for sure, that it is.  It's engaging stuff.

Finally, Preminger was not only a lawyer but a bit of a provocateur -- he insisted on frankness in the use of sexual references in the case, which, after all, could hardly have plausibly been conducted without them.  But words are used that were not used in movies prior to 1959, and that made the movie ""controversial"" in its time, however relatively tame the language might seem today.  Still, it's bit shocking to hear it in the very clearly 1950s small-town context that the visual features of the movie evoke -- and Preminger insisted on shooting the whole thing on location in the UP of Michigan.  You won't forget Joseph Welch as Judge Weaver relishing the word ""panties,"" a word that I'm sure was never mentioned in his set-to with Senator McCarthy.",1479686400,2,3980,4.759825327510917

Laura Manion isn't particularly likable or sympathetic, but that is one of the reasons ""Anatomy"" is such a wonder to behold. NO ONE is particularly likable in this film.

Jimmy Stewart is somewhere in the middle. Earnest, authoritative and comfortable in an interesting and challenging role. The judge is played by Joseph N. Welch, the attorney representing the United States Arm in the McCarthy hearings. He is the lawyer that said to McCarthy ""...have you no decency sir? At long last, have  you no decency?"" this destroyed McCarthy and his appearance in this role is perhaps a tribute to his courage.

517675,3,6302800897,"One night in 1959, Laura Manion (Lee Remick) returns home and tells her husband that she's been raped. Enraged, he husband grabs a gun and kills the man she accused of the crime. When arrested, Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) claims that he didn't remember any of it, but nobody really believes his story. His wife turns to a relatively unknown country lawyer for help, and after meeting with the Manion's, Paul Biegler (Jimmy Stewart) agrees to take the case. It's never clear whether or not even he believes his client's story, but either way, Biegler is determined to get the man exonerated. Many law professors consider this film to be the most accurate depiction of a trial ever fictionalized on film. Likewise, the Academy was also very impressed, giving Anatomy of A Murder seven Oscar nominations, but does the film really stand the test of time? For 1959, the Manion's were as promiscuous and dysfunctional a couple as could be on film, however in 2015, they are rather tame. That's not the only thing that gets lost in time, as the laws surrounding the insanity defense have also changed, making the whole premise around this trial more than somewhat outdated. This film simply doesn't have the impact in 2015, that it did in 1959, but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining. Jimmy Stewart stars as Defense Attorney, Paul Biegler, who unfortunately isn't the most interesting man in the world. He's a very bland character, without much depth, but he is an intelligent lawyer, who finds every trick and loophole in the book to defend his client. Jimmy Stewart was a tall lanky man with a strange voice, who I thought was a natural when it came to physical comedy, but Stewart preferred to play a more intelligent character, especially later in his career, and Paul Biegler is a textbook example of that. Anatomy of A Murder is on almost every top 100 list you can find, and in it's time it absolutely belonged there, but by 2015 standards, it's very long, tame, and outdated, despite the excellent story and depiction of a courtroom.",1431216000,,2042,4.787535410764873

517705,5,6302800897,"Barney Quill was dead. That is all that is clear to viewers as the three hour classic Anatomy of a Murder opens on the screen. Director Otto Preminger assembled an all star cast for this riveting and thoughtful trial movie. The cast is headed by Jimmy Stuart playing a fishing loving bachelor attorney who was the county District Attorney until a recent election defeat. His client is army lt. Manion who shot bar owner Barney Quill for raping his lascivious and sexy wife Lee Remick. Stewart s secretary is played with humor and wit by Eve Arden while his fellow attorney Arthur O Connell is also along for the ride. Did Manion murder Quill in a rational state of mind or was he subject to temporary insanity? Was Laura Manion really raped or was she stepping out with Quill? The smart Lansing lawyer prosecutor is the great actor George C. Scott. Real life judge Joseph Welch does a wonderful job as the presiding judge in this film which was his only motion picture appearance.
  The movie runs three hours but passes quickly as the viewer becomes immersed in the trial dialogue. The film was daring for its time with such subjects as rape and a woman s panties being important to the plot. Anatomy of a Murder was nominated for seven Oscars in 1959 but did not win any statues. It has become a classic which will keep you entertained and provide your little grey cells a workout. Enjoy!",1425168000,,1390,4.578313253012048

The point being that the moral issue which is at stake here is one that has basically been ruled on in the meantime, and the ruling is that the morality of this film belongs to the past only. As such, it is possible to watch the entire film and simply not know what they are trying to get at. And as such, the ending is very confusing, because no trial today would end in such a verdict. Nor does the populace support the concept, albeit they might sympathize to some degree.

Film students or connoisseurs can still enjoy the excellent direction and performances. As an example of the film-making art it is excellent. It is just that as the story and underlying moral battle goes, it is passe' beyond resolution.",1423958400,,856,4.52258064516129

What makes the movie a 100 best classic is the well-constructed plot, excellent dialogue and fully rounded cast of characters, all of them fully articulated and individual.  The chief of these is Jimmy Stewart's character, Lloyd Biegler, a small town lawyer in Michigain's remote Upper Peninsula, licking his wounds in an impoverished private practice after losing a recent election for the District Attorney's Office.  Biegler gets his big case as a private attorney when an army lieutenant,  is tried for the murder of a local bartender.

Lee Remick plays a good, believeable role as the victim. The movie is two and a half hours which is a bit long but it the extra time is used well, it keeps your interest the more you watch. It's rather risque for it's time coming out in 1959 but it's feels realisic and like what being in a court session on a case of murder would be like in real life. It was ahead of it's time and holds up well with age. The acting is excellent throughout which makes it one of the best crime dramas of all time.

It's a timeless courtroom drama brilliantly written and directed and what a cast!  Every role is played beautifully.  Lee Remick steals every scene she's in. James Stewart has rarely been better.  And who can resist Arthur O'Connell, George C. Scott and Eve Arden in key supporting roles. I recently read Foster Hirsch's biography of Preminger and was pleasantly rewarded with a thoughtful appreciation of a very progressive and  underrated director.  I think his larger than life persona tended to overshadow his true talents. He made his share of stinkers but there more worthwhile efforts than one first imagines when you study his filmography.  ""Anatomy"" is his masterwork.

There the similarity ends as one is a 50's classic that should be mentioned with To Kill a Mochingbird
for the art of motion picture making and the other as a complete failure
of writers and actors in The Paperboy. As impressive as the cast is with a bit part by Duke Ellington,
even the sleepy slow judge is a master piece of characterization in this move.

517991,5,6302800897,"As a young teen in the late `70s, I remember that ANATOMY OF A MURDER would be shown on TV from time to time.  I have always loved courtroom dramas (I loved watching old PERRY MASON reruns, and great movies like WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION).  To this day, I still love them...shows like LAW AND ORDER grab me or a film like PRIMAL FEAR.  There's just something about the courtroom that distills drama in a very focused way.  (I don't much care for shows ABOUT lawyers, like LA LAW.  It's the courtroom shenanigans that interest me.)

I had the great good fortune this past weekend to revisit my old favorite, ANATOMY OF A MURDER, on Criterion's Blu-ray.  I loved it as a kid, and I still love it now.  This is a 2 hour and 40 minute film, and it does on occasion pace itself a bit slowly...but for the most part, it hums along quite crisply.  Even though the movie is from 1959, and many of the legal arguments, forensic techniques and moral attitudes are utterly out-of-date...it feels remarkably modern in many ways.  Perhaps that's because sharp scripts and great acting never go out of style.

ANATOMY OF A MURDER tells the story of a former prosecutor turned community lawyer (James Stewart), who would rather spend his days fishing, but is lured into taking the case of a military man (Ben Gazzara) who shot and killed the man who allegedly raped his wife (Lee Remick).  The case is pretty open and shut, it would seem.  Yet Stewart is clearly intrigued by the overtly sexual Remick and the possibility of trying to prove the husband had ""an irresistible urge"" which rendered him temporarily insane.

The film explores the case quite deeply and we get a good sense of all the witnesses and other personalities.  Once the trial itself starts, nearly halfway through the film, we are primed to see how Stewart is able to plant reasonable doubt (although that term never comes up).  The trial proceeds with lots of legal maneuverings and some of the most amusing courtroom antics I've seen.

I hesitate to reveal much about the plot beyond this, because half the fun of the film is watching the little bits and pieces of the story coming to light...yet the heart of the case remains ambiguous throughout.  It's not the story of an ""innocent"" man trying to beat a rap.  It's the story of how his lawyer, despite overwhelming odds, works to bend and twist things to his client's benefit.  Although by today's standards, the moral ambiguities are fairly tame...this is at its core a DEEPLY cynical story.  It seems like it should be more ""heroic"", because after all, that's JIMMY STEWART as the lawyer.  He must be the ""good"" guy.

It's not that simple.  Director Otto Preminger is greatly helped by a terrific script, but he's also assisted by the simple fact that the general public loves Stewart.  We root for him immediately, and there's no doubt he is thoroughly charming and amusing.  But it's far too simple to see him as merely a ""good"" guy.  From the subtle coaching he gives his client, to the banter he engages in with the wife...this is a complex character whose scruples are not necessarily squeaky clean.  It's actually quite amazing...we watch, liking Stewart immensely and realizing at the same time that what he's fighting for isn't exactly noble.  It's not ""un-noble"" either...it's ambiguous.

Stewart is great.  It's one of my favorite performances from him.  At age 51, he's at the height of his acting powers (this was done around the same time as VERTIGO...Stewart was having a mid-career renaissance).  His performance is funny, charismatic and nuanced.  And while he's clearly the dominant force in the film, there are plenty of wonderful performances around.  Really nice work from Eve Arden (Stewart's assistant), Arthur McConnell (Stewart's friend, a lush & former lawyer), George C. Scott (in a great early career role...his final cross-examination is a marvel) and even Murray Hamilton as a friend of the victim.  Lee Remick, in an early role, is astoundingly sexual...it's a pretty daring performance for 1959.  (Although I struggle with her being so vivacious just two days after being raped and her husband arrested for murder.)  The only performance I didn't care for came from Ben Gazzara.  It was a mostly one-note performance, and because his character is so unlikeable, not tempering that with some lighter or richer moments just didn't work.  (And the guy smokes cigarettes in a long cigarette holder, while wearing his army uniform.  It looks SO incongruous.  It may be accurate for the time, but it was immensely distracting!)

ANATOMY OF A MURDER is just terrific.  Funny, dramatic and well-crafted all around.  And the Criterion Blu-Ray makes it look gorgeous.  They've done a fantastic job of making the image looking like film being projected in a theater...the grain is very nice.  They've pumped up the Duke Ellington score (Ellington appears briefly in the film himself)...I'm not a huge jazz fan, I must admit, but if you're a fan...the soundtrack alone makes the film worth experiencing, and the sound is immaculate on the blu-ray.  I'll admit, I haven't spent much time with the bonus features, but they are plentiful and sound quite interesting.  This is ALREADY a 5-star for me...but once I do settle down for some of the bonus material, that can only be enhanced.",1364256000,5,5316,4.833887043189368

517996,5,6302800897,"Arguably the best courtroom drama ever produced on film...THE BEST in my opinion. It has been used for years in law schools as a teaching tool. Adapted from an equally fine novel by Robert Traver (the pen name of a real Michigan attorney and judge) it features exceptional performances by an all-star cast; expert craftsmanship by director, Otto Preminger; a memorable jazz soundtrack composed by Duke Ellington (who also has a small part in the movie) and a first rate story, that truly is an anatomy of a murder. It is a bit long as the screenplay delves into aspects of jurisprudence we don't usually see on screen, such as research and investigation. It follows the book fairly closely; the only significant departure being the portrayal of Mary Pilant (Kathryn Grant) as Barney Quill's illegitimate daughter. This is one of Jimmy Stuarts finest performances and should have merited an Oscar...he lost out to Charlton Heston for ""Ben-Hur"". Lee Remick, in only her fourth film role, is perfectly cast as the female lead and Ben Gazzara, in a breakout role for him, is also pitch perfect as her husband and the murder defendant. George C. Scott, in only his second film role, plays one of the prosecuting attorneys. Arthur O'Connor, Eve Arden, Kathryn Grant and Orson Bean flesh out what is truly an all-star cast by today's standards; although, as noted, in 1959 some of these actors were just getting started.

It is one thing for the clashing attorneys to make their witnesses squirm, its another to make viewers squirm in impatience. But then this is Otto Preminger making a p-o-i-n-t, very Germanically, it seems.

AOAM has some very effective cinematography. The scenes are well-framed for the drama they contain and the actors hit their marks just right as the drama unfolds, and unfolds, and unfolds. The verdict almost comes as a let-down when it is finally reached.

I very much liked the use of jazz in the soundtrack and about fell off the couch when I recognized THE Duke Ellington playing in the local Michigan club. The jazz effect still works; it hasn't become dated.

518047,5,6302800897,"Hollywood hearsay alleges that Jimmy Stewart's dad was so offended by this film that he reportedly took out a local newspaper ad exhorting people to not see it. Way to support, dad. So, listen, ANATOMY OF A MURDER not only is one of the best, most polished courtroom dramas ever put to cinema, it's also one of the most controversial. Factor in that this film debuted in 1959, against the backdrop of the sheltered 1950s era, and you can see why some people threw a conniption. But director Otto Preminger always did like thumbing his nose at the Hays Code. And as a raspberry to the holier-than-thou contingent, ANATOMY OF A MURDER did rake in seven Academy Award nominations (but don't ask how many Oscars it actually won).

In Michigan's upper peninsula, small-town lawyer Paul Biegler (Stewart) defends an Army Lieutenant accused of murdering the local barkeep who had raped and beaten his wife. Biegler enters a plea of ""irresistible impulse"" (a.k.a. temporary insanity) but knows his case will be difficult to prove. To quote Paul Biegler himself: ""I'm just a humble country lawyer trying to do his best against a brilliant prosecutor from the big city of Lansing."" And renowned Assistant State Attorney General Claude Dancer (George C. Scott) truly does make for slick and utterly ruthless opposition. This movie runs two hours forty minutes, but Stewart and Scott's rambunctious courtroom sparring glues you to your seat. And lest you think Stewart gets all the choice lines, here's George C. Scott's eventual rebuttal: ""Your Honor, I protest. Mr. Biegler is perhaps the least disciplined and the most completely out-of-order attorney I've ever seen in a courtroom."" Heh.

The movie doesn't hold anything back in its explicit treatment of courtroom dialogue, and this crude frankness exhibited is probably what so incensed James Stewart's dad (again, way to support, dad). ANATOMY OF A MURDER is a pioneering picture in that it's one of the first films to address rape in such frank terminology. But note that the terminology, while deemed shocking and graphic in the context of the times, is appropriate in how it's applied during trial. ANATOMY OF A MURDER hews most faithfully to the spirit of the courtroom drama as most of the film does take place in the courtroom. However, this film also touches on all the basic stages, at least from the defense's perspective, of the American criminal justice system. We follow Paul Biegler as he goes thru client interviews and the arraignment process and then the trial itself.

The behind-the-scenes stuff is almost as interesting as the film itself. ANATOMY OF A MURDER is adapted from Robert Traver's book. Robert Traver happens to be the pseudonym of real-life Supreme Court judge, John D. Voelker, who felt it inappropriate for a judge to be penning steamy courtroom thrillers (ergo, the alias). Voelker based the story on a 1952 murder trial in which he was the defense attorney. The judge in the film is played by real-life litigator Joseph N. Welch who famously scolded Senator Joseph McCarthy during the televised Un-American Activities hearings in 1954. Yeah, he was that brave cat who dared challenge McCarthy: ""Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?""

It's one of the most perfect courtroom dramas put to celluloid, up there with TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and TWELVE ANGRY MEN and INHERIT THE WIND. Would I call James Stewart's performance electrifying? I dunno. But he anchors the film, and he certainly mesmerizes as the defense attorney whose folksy demeanor masks a sharp legal mind. I enjoyed the theatrics his character engaged in, realizing that his desperate tactic hinges on putting on a show while hoping for the best. It's a long shot of a case, remember? I wouldn't be surprised if this role was instrumental in Stewart's landing a short-lived 1970s television series, HAWKINS, in which he also played a small-town lawyer.

Part of the fun is in watching the bemused judge try to keep Stewart's antics to a minimum. But then George C. Scott gets into the act. The film also benefits from Duke Ellington's bluesy compositions. The score enhances that grittiness coursing thru the story. It ups the sexy. Ben Gazzara and Lee Remick are stand-outs as, respectively, Biegler's hostile client and his kittenish wife. Gazing at Gazzara's stone-cold expression, from jump one wonders at him... Gazing at Lee Remick's curves and blatant coy behavior, one questions her sincerity. Remick is terrific at conveying a sense of ambiguity, casting doubt but layering in enough vulnerability that you end up checking yourself. Eve Arden, meanwhile, provides wisecracking levity as Stewart's faithful secretary. Except that ANATOMY OF A MURDER, overall, is no laughing matter. It is bold and thought-provoking and, in its time, highly controversial. In the courtroom, several characters utter the word (cover your ears) ""panties.""",1356307200,2,4931,5.060270602706027

Enjoy Duke Ellington's brief appearance, and music underscoring the film creating a blue mood.

518101,5,6302800897,"Yeah, Ben Gazzara is the young Army Lt. who is accused of murder. The Lt. does not dispute the charges, but instead claims his wife was raped by the victim and that he killed the culprit in a rage. The complex courtroom drama that ensues is ground breaking on many levels. The Hays code was in its death throes, soon to fall victim to a group of films and directors that refused to adhere (Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolfe and Blowup are the two in the mid 60s that finally killed this code). But Anatomy of a Murder was among the early films to challenge the Hays code (the same year as Some Like It Hot). In Anatomy of a Murder, the film graphically discusses rape and murder, a first since the Hays code came into being.

The film has been restored with Criterion's amazing software, keeping the sharpness of the picture and reducing grain and noise (unlike cheaper restoration filters that blur the picture). The picture and sound quality of the Blu-Ray is pretty amazing. I do highly recommend spending the extra dollars if you have a player. There are a good number of extras, though nothing really to exciting. The included booklet with an essay is nice, but it's not something that can't be easily found online.

The film features terrific acting by Stewart and a young George C. Scott, some great directing and set design and framing; but the supporting cast can be a bit dull and lifeless at times. It just seems that Stewart and Scott are stealing the show. Much of the film takes place in a courtroom, so if you do not like courtroom dramas, then run away! The case stays central to the film, not much time is spent on tangent stories. Even what seems like a side story, wild goose chase ends up being central to the story. And you can really see where many later courtroom drama films took inspiration, A Few Good Men comes to mind.

So I do find it tough to spend $24 on the film, especially since I have it available at a local library. But even then, I would hesitate to purchase this film. The price vs extras vs re-watch-ability don't add up. I feel this is more of a rent it from Netflix and watch it once every blue moon kind of film. Save your $ for the amazing Criterion releases of Kurosawa, Ozu, Fellini, or the out of print Hitchcock Criterion releases (Rebecca, Notorious). If you are a fan, then by all means, spend away.

518103,4,6302800897,"Let me start by saying, if you liked this movie, you will love the far superior book by Robert Traver (penname of Michigan attorney, John D. Voelker). The movie concerns a defense attorney, Paul Biegler (a perfectly cast James Stewart) who defends a client, Lieut. Manion, accused of First Degree Murder for shooting the man who allegedly raped his wife Laura (Lee Remick).

The first half of the book deals with the attorney and his partner (Arthur O'Connell) digging up evidence that is being subverted by an innkeeper to preserve the reputation of the slain man. Most of this has been cut from the film. The second half deals with the battle between Biegler and one of the prosecutors, Claude Dancer (George C. Scott), a man who will use every dirty trick in the book to win his case. The battle of wits between Biegler and Dancer is what keeps the momentum building until the end. Unfortunately, in the movie, there are many hints of Dancer's ruthlessness but he is never allowed to blossom fully into the archvillain that helped make the novel such a bestseller.

Exceptional performances are given by all the actors mentioned, as well as by Eve Arden as Biegler's wise-cracking secretary and Murray Hamilton as a bartender with a few secrets. Of interest is the fact that the novel was actually autobiographical fiction based upon a case that Voelker defended in 1952.

518104,3,6302800897,"If you enjoy jazz and Duke Ellington (who wrote and performed the score, and even did a cameo), you will love the music to this film.

If the film had been set in New Orleans, it would have made more sense.  But Upper Peninsula Michigan??  And, since I hate jazz, it made it difficult for me to sit through much of the film.

The story itself is okay.  I know that experts rate this as one of the best trial films ever made, but I don't see it.  And what makes for accuracy doesn't always translate to entertainment.  Still, the pacing isn't too bad, and the court scenes are okay, but it's nothing special.

The one shining aspect of this film is the acting.  Jimmy Stewart is excellent, as always, Lee Remick is younger than I've ever seen her, and George C. Scott, even at this early point in his career, is showing the brilliance he had ahead.

I think I've watched it 20 or 30 times since I saw it in a theater in 1959.  Reminds me of one of George S. Kaufman's barbs: ""What's the matter? Didn't you get it the first time?""  At any rate, the Blu-ray is terrific and we see it the way it was originally photographed and not the damned 4 x 3 screen with which Columbia/TriStar butchered the DVD release.

It's among my favorite courtroom dramas along with ""Inherit the Wind"" and ""Judgment at Nurmenberg.""

The choice of Duke Ellington and his Orchestra for a music score was interesting.  Big bands were in decline since the end of World War II as many of the musicians of the day had been drafted and the rise of television did the rest. People at one time liked to go out at night and dance or go to the movies and now they were sitting at home watching their new TVs.  Ellington and Count Basie were the last two black bands still in the business but by the early 50s Ellington was ready to pull the plug.  The era of his greatest popularity had been the 30s and 40s.  Then something unexpected happened.  George Wein who was managing the Newport Jazz Festival booked Ellington's band for one night at the 1956 festival.  The evening went well -- they were graciously received but nothing special.  Then during a break Ellington decided to play two pieces he had written in the 1930s:  ""Diminuendo in Blue"" followed by ""Crescendo in Blue,"" connected by a saxophone solo by tenor saxophonist Paul Gonsalves.  The first part was played and Gonssalves started his rocking, blues-based solo.  After six or seven choruses, Ellington sensed a reaction coming from the audience so he signalled Gonsalves to continue playing.  The crowd became more and more excited.  By the time Gonsalves had blown 27 choruses, the audience was on the verge of a riot.  People were standing on the chairs and dancing in the aisles.  When the piece ended, Elllington began to fear an actual riot and  wanted to end the set.  George Wein told Ellington to play a couple of slow numbers to calm the audience down.  George Avakian of Columbia records was there and immediately put Ellington under contract and released an (edited) album of the concert.  It became a best-selling LP, unheard of for jazz.  Ellington's picture appeared on the cover of Time and he changed his mind about terminating his orchestra.  Most of his musicians had been with him through the 30s and 40s and when he composed a new piece he did so with a specific musician in mind, something no other band leader had ever done.

How can you reconcile the music of a black jazz band with a story of a murder trial in upper Michigan?  You really can't except that Otto Preminger, an immigrant from Vienna, thought of jazz as THE American music, something most Americans did not, being largely unhip.

There are moments in the film when Ellington's music seems to be at odds with the subject, but in the scene in which Stewart and Remick are talking outside of her trailer and he, as her attorney,  is warning her that her public behavior could well cause a negative outcome in her husband's trial, a soft bluesy theme with dense harmonies is heard and it is absolutely perfect.  We sense in his admonishment of Remick's behavior that he, himself, is drawn to her and it is all said with that musical interlude.

The rendering of this great film on Blu-ray is ideal both in video and sound.  The spoken track is vividly recorded and very clear and Preminger used both very close and very distant microphoning to get different effects.  The music track, unlike the way jazz is usually recorded -- rather up-front and brilliant -- here is slightly soft in the treble, but not muffled, giving it an intimate quality ideal for this occasion.  Unfortunately there is no commentary track, but the extras are very fine and informative.",1340409600,11,3978,4.627674750356634
518106,4,6302800897,"James Stewart plays just the sort of attorney you would want to represent you if you were accused of murder.  His client, a young and rather arrogant soldier, is not only accused of murder, he admits he shot the guy.  His argument is that there is an ""unwritten law"" that justifies the killing.  Gently, his lawyer points out that unwritten law is not relevant in a court of law: only the written kind.  Still, he is willing to take the case mostly because he feels sorry for the young soldier and his rather pretty wife.

I've always had a real soft spot in my heart for James Stewart, and for many of the other members of the cast, and it did, after all, get the academy award for best picture of 1959. One bonus is a score by Duke Ellington, who also does a cameo role as a piano player. I'm also fond of stories about lawyers.  So with all my biases, I have to give it four stars.",1337558400,,884,4.201183431952662

Just a great and stimulating movie. Eve Arden and Arthur O'Connell and of course Gazarra and the beautiful Lee Remick shine.

No wonder it was banned in Chicago and a few other places back in 1959. But any film that combines Floyd the barber with Duke Ellington can't be all that bad. In fact, this is probably the greatest court room film ever made. Ellington's score alone is worth the price of admission (mono or 5.1 on the blu-ray); and Otto Preminger directing James Stewart, with George C Scott thrown in the mix makes this a perfect film. The black and white is just almost flawless with nary a blemish along the way. Definitely a must-see. Any objections to this film are overruled....",1330819200,4,695,4.658536585365853

He gives a biographical sketch of the film director and how his education in law school would influence and inform his career as a filmmaker. Hirsch takes us through Preminger's start as a studio contract director on through to his stature as an independent filmmaker working within Hollywood. Naturally, he dwells on Preminger's work in Anatomy of a Murder.

There are excerpts from a 1967 episode of the television show Firing Line that sees Preminger discussing censorship with host William F. Buckley Jr. The film director comes across as passionate and knowledgeable as he eloquently defends his stance on censorship.

Film critic Gary Giddins talks about jazz musician Duke Ellington's score for the film. He briefly talks about jazz music in films of the 1950s and provides background to Ellington's career. Giddins also analyzes the film's score.

518141,5,6302800897,"With the possible exception of LAURA (1944), I don't think that Otto Preminger ever directed a more riveting motion picture than ANATOMY OF A MURDER, which is also one of the best courtroom dramas ever made.

The film, adapted from the best-selling novel by Robert Traver, was quite controversial when it was first released in 1959, primarily because the trial not only involved a first degree murder case, but also a brutal rape.  Though somewhat fictionalized, the case was based on a real incident, and Preminger chose to film his movie on the actual Michigan locations where the events took place.

James Stewart starred as the defense attorney for Army lieutenant Ben Gazzara, on trial for shooting down the man who ostensibly raped his voluptuous wife (Lee Remick).  Also in the cast were Arthur O'Connell, Eve Arden, George C. Scott, Murray Hamilton, Kathryn Grant and legendary attorney Joseph N. Welch, who plays the judge.  Duke Ellington composed the influential jazz score.

Granted, the film does move along at a slightly deliberate pace, but unlike flashier courtroom movies, this one has the ring of truth about it.

ANATOMY OF A MURDER was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture.  Unfortunately, 1959 was also the year of BEN-HUR.

 The 2-disc DVD from The Criterion Collection not only features a new digital restoration of the film and an alternate 5.1 soundtrack, but there are also interviews with Preminger biographer Foster Hirsch, music critic Gary Giddens on the Ellington score; excerpts from a 1957 Preminger interview with William F. Buckley Jr., a booklet that includes essays on both Preminger and Welch and much more.

518142,5,6302800897,"Wow! I just got the new Criterion release of ANATOMY OF A MURDER, and the improvement over the old Columbia DVD release is astounding. The new DVD and Blu-Ray give us a beautifully restored print in the original, correct aspect ratio (1.85:1). There's also a new Dolby 5.1 stereo remix of the soundtrack, in addition to a clean new recording of the original mono. And the second disc has several revealing, informative docs about this film's history, its importance in world cinema, and its rule-breaking director, Otto Preminger.

As for the film itself, all I can say is another ""Wow!"" It's a literate, well-acted, controversial and important film version of the bestselling novel (based on an actual murder trial) by a Michigan Supreme Court justice. How controversial? Well, AOAM and several other Preminger titles (THE MOON IS BLUE, THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM, ADVISE AND CONSENT, and especially BUNNY LAKE IS MISSING) were instrumental in the formation of the MPAA ratings system that is still in use today (G, PG, R, NC-17). How important? The film and the novel are still required viewing/reading in many, many American law schools. There's a good reason for that--just watch it, and you'll see why.

The American justice system is imperfect, but it's still the best system in the world. AOAM shows us both sides of that fact, the good (presumed innocent until proven guilty) and the bad (juries can only decide based on evidence presented, not ""common sense"" or even ""obvious facts"" that are not entered into evidence). The lawyers are obligated to do their best, no matter the circumstances--that's their job. Unfortunately, innocent people are sometimes convicted and guilty people sometimes go free. In 1959, Preminger and his brilliant cast and crew gave us a perfect example of this. And the new Criterion package is the one you want, trust me. It's gorgeous.

518144,1,6302800897,"First I ask simply, what is the purpose of making this film? What is the lesson? Do characters grow from their experiences? Is there a moral message behind the film? These are not rhetorical questions - I would like to know your opinion.

In the Lincoln Lawyer, for example, we are shown a defense attorney who comes to the realization that his client is a murderer of willful intent. He is given ample reason to want to make the right decision, including the threats made by his client, and the apparent murder of his colleague. He is given a chance to make things right, both with his past client (who was wrongly-accused) and by putting his current client in prison for murder. And he takes that chance through a series of clever actions.

In Anatomy of a Murder, the defense attorney knows immediately that the defendant is guilty of murder with willful intent. Knowing fully that the defendant is guilty, and *before* even accepting the defendant as his client, the defense attorney gives the defendant a variety of resources and defenses to win his case. Why? And when told that he might not even get paid for his work, he still decides to take on the case. In his own words, ""I think I'll just stay with you, to make damned sure you get off."" Why? What is in it for him?

People often make the argument that, ""he is just doing his job"", but it was not his job to take on the case, or to help the defendant *before* accepting him as a client, or to do the job even on risk of not being paid, just to ""make damned sure"" the murderer is set free.

Why was Jimmy Stewart chosen for this film? He is shown acting deplorably, with no recognition whatsoever that his choices are wrong. What was the purpose of using his lovable character? To persuade through emotional appeal that his actions are good? To show the audience how easily they can be won over by emotion alone?

Some additional points:

* No chance for him to vindicate his past actions is provided by the plot. The conflict between his character and his actions is never resolved, and appears to have been purposely left unresolved, or even unacknowledged, as if to assume that there are no negative emotional consequences to bad actions - i.e., asserting a mind-body dichotomy.

* No examination is given for why he went from being a prosecutor to defense attorney, and how that has impacted him. Any such examination would have presented a contradiction between the lovable character and his choices - a conflict which would have demanded resolution through character development or final vindication.

* We are never clear on why exactly he proceeded with the case. He accepts the case just to ""make damned sure"" the murderer was set free, and he makes occasional reference to the legal fees, as if he is only in it for the money. Is this to demonstrate that he is greedy or selfish? If so, then how is it in his self-interest to set loose an extremely jealous, violent murderer, whose wife has made multiple passes at him. At the end of the film he is shown happily choosing to meet up with the murderer and his wife, knowing that the husband had witnessed his wife make passes at him. How is that a wise choice, if he is just being greedy and selfish?

* At the end, the lawyer is presented with clear evidence that the murderer never believed he was acting based on ""irresistible impulse"", by using the term jokingly. How does the lawyer react? By laughing it off.

* Even the title makes no sense, as nobody in the film is interested in examining the murder itself. The reason there is apparent ambiguity is simply because nobody in the film is interested in the truth except as it relates to helping or hurting their case. What actually happened doesn't matter to them - all that matters is that people believe what they claim happened.

I see praise for the film's representation of trial law. Now, if the film had only depicted a trial (a la 12 Angry Men), maybe I could agree. But we are given a preface and afterword, and my analysis has focused primarily on those, as they are the only means by which to judge the lawyer's decisions during the trial.

As I said, before even accepting to represent Manion, Biegler gave him vital legal advice and coaching, while knowing and explicitly stating that Manion was a deliberate murderer and there was no justification for his action. And after the trial is over, Biegler made clear his disinterest in the consequences of his actions, laughing at the bogus insanity plea.

Any law professor, judge, or lawyer who praises this film must necessarily damn himself.

I'll ask my original questions again: what is the purpose of making this film? What is the lesson? Do characters grow from their experiences? Is there a moral message behind the film?",1328313600,11,4766,4.598351001177856

The fellow who plays his adorable alcoholic side-kick is even more annoyingly cute, and isn't it nice that he ends up kicking the habit?!  Ben Gazzara has a compelling presence but his character is so one-dimensional that no one cares.  The lovely, wonderful Lee Remick is either badly cast or terribly directed.  She is far too intelligent to play such a bimbo and her attempts at being a trailer-trash flirt are almost embarassing.

On the plus side, Eve Arden brings her smart, cut-through-the bs presence and the man who played the judge, who I understand was a real judge, was excellent.  Also on the plus side was the presence of a young George C. Scott as the fancy lawyer from the big city of Lansing.  Some have called his performance over-the-top and that may be so, but at least I woke up when he came on screen.  The close-ups of Scott and Remick on the witness stand are quite wonderful.  Another plus is a brief appearance by the always charming Orson Beane.

The worst thing about this film, in my opinion, is the story.  Perhaps the book makes a better case for this defense of irresistable urge or whatever they called it.  But, to me, it held no water at all....And since the whole story depended on it, I just had to roll my eyes and chalk the whole film up to the mentality of another era when that might have had some credibility.

The original book, named the city as Thunder Bay, Ontario.  The film calls it Iron City Michigan, which is apropos, because mining for iron and copper was major in the area, at the time the film was produced.

Stewart's performance is impeccable and the courtroom scenes are tense and riveting.  Everyone who testifies has faults and the imperfections come out in the testimony.  George C. Scott plays the opposing attorney and keeps the tension building to the end.

The movie was filmed in black and white during the 1950's.  It frames the morality of the time and reveals the gray areas.

518197,4,6302800897,"James Stewart was really a fantastic actor.  Winning the Oscar for ""The Philadelphia Story,"" Stewart served proudly in the Army Air Corps during W.W.II.  It was after returning to films that Stewart showed just how many different genres of films he could excel in.  After starring in the classic ""Its A Wonderful Life"" (which was not successful during its initial release) and the comedy ""Harvey,"" Stewart turned to the western and starred in 6 classic, hard-biten westerns directed by Anthony Mann.  Then came his his Hitchcock phase with the classics ""Rear Window,"" ""Vertigo"" and ""The Man who Knew Too Much."" (He previously appeared in Hitchcock's ""Rope"" in 1948.)  After appearing in this film in 1959, Stewart continued making classic westerns like ""Liberty Valance,"" ""How the West Was Won"" and ""Shenandoah.""  He also appeared in numerous comedies like ""Bell, Book and Candle,"" ""Mr. Hobbs Takes A Vacation"" and ""Take Her, Shes Mine.""  The man really could do anything in films.
However, I think ""Anatomy of a Murder"" is one of his greatest performances.  As the samll-town lawyer who defends an angry Army Lieutenant accused of shooting the man who raped his wife, Stewart is simply fantastic in this film's many dramatic courtroom scenes. The rest of the cast is terrific as well.  Ben Gazzara,( one of my favorites from his  1960's tv series ""Run for Your Life,"") is a ticking time bomb waiting to go off as the angry Army Lieutenant.  Lee Remick, a beautiful and wonderful actress who died much too soon, is quite sexy as the Lieutenant's slutty wife.  George C. Scott gives his usual impressive performance as the prosecuting attorney.  (I still think Scott's performance in ""Patton"" is the greatest performance I've ever seen in film.)  Eve Arden is  excellent as Stewart's long-suffering secretary and Arthur O. Connell, an actor I never cared for very much as a result of so many of his guest appearances on mediocre tv shows, is actually quite good as Stewart's alcoholic former-lawyer friend.  Another terrific performance is from a non-actor, Joseph Welch, the lawyer who challenged Joe McCarthy in the Army-McCarthy hearings, as the judge.
But this is Stewart's film and he is great.  If it wasn't released in the year that ""Ben-Hur"" won 11 Oscars, I think Stewart would have been a lock for Best Actor.  This was considered a very daring film with the conclusion of the case resting on the discovery of a pair of panties.  (I read once that Stewart's father was very unhappy with his son appearing in what he considered a dirty movie.  Supposedly, in protest, he removed Stewart's Oscar which before this had stood proudly in his hardware store's window.)
The extras on this dvd include a montage of scenes from the film, accompanied by the Duke Ellington score and a rather bizarre trailer, hosted in Hitchcock-style by the director, Otto Preminger, in which he makes the cast swear that this is a terrific film.  (Stewart looks kind of embarassed.)
This is a long, leisurely-running film clocking in at 2 hours and twenty minutes.  However you won't be bored.
And if I haven't said it frequently enough, Stewart is terrific.",1270771200,,3142,4.944761904761905

The sexist attitudes in the film literally made me feel ill. The most stunning moment is when the entire courtroom brakes into full-throated laughter at the mention of the ""panties"" that are missing evidence in the alleged rape.
This movie does not stand the test of time. It seems like an overly long endorsement of those ancient falsehoods that good women don't get raped and bad women lie about it.

518241,5,6302800897,"This movie kind of snuck up on me and by the ending I felt as if I had been baited and hooked. Preminger was teasing us all along by taking advantage of the fact that we all aproach a movie by early on picking out the bad guys and the good guys. Naturally we all see Jimmy Stewart as the good guy hero who we prepare to root for from beginning to end. But during the last few scenes, in which a drunken Lee Remick chases Jimmy up a law house stairway with a girdle in hand and then the very last shot where Jimmy finds Lee's shoes in a garbage can, it is then I realize that I have been conned. I was aware of the fact that Lee and her murderer husband Ben Gazarra were somewhat unsympathetic from the very start but I felt certain that somehow they would exhibit redeeming qualities at movies end, but no way! Preminger only reinforced how truely awful they really were and Jimmy is only a scheming lawyer out to revive his career with a drunken sidekick who proves very helpful. When you think about it, this is how the law and the world really do work - OJ Simson case in point. Who would have thought that in 1959 a movie this cynical, which doesn't really even feel cynical, would pack such a real world punch as this one does?
  Call me a naive country bumkin but this movie really amazed me and I can't believe that more people aren't taken aback the way I was. Preminger really plays with your head and hides his true intentions until by movies end you really feel like a fool for not having suspected what he was really up too. Can we have more discussion about this or are we all so jaded that nothing surprises us anymore?",1253750400,2,1633,4.197452229299363

518244,4,6302800897,"Risqu&eacute; for its time, and certainly profound and entertaining; `Anatomy of a Murder' is a very well done courtroom drama with some excellent performances.  What's exceedingly nice about this film is that it ages very well, despite the change in times.  Sure, some of the court outbursts seem rather humorous to us today (beings that `panties' is a word only immature frat boys find funny) but the entirety of the film still rings very true, and the entertainment value has not diminished over the years.

The film tells of small-town lawyer Paul Biegler who takes on the case of defending an army lieutenant who is accused of murdering a man he believes attacked his wife.  As Paul gets to know the victim, Laura Manion, he realizes that she may not be being entirely truthful; but his attraction to her and his desire to win the case cloud his better judgment.

Let's talk a little bit about Lee Remick.  I just kind of laid into her acting a bit on my review for `Days of Wine and Roses', where I found her to be awkward and unconvincing.  I had seen this movie first and so I was really anticipating her performance alongside Lemmon.  The fact is, I thought she was marvelous here.  She really nails her character.  Some have balked at her being unbelievable as a victim, but that is entirely the point.  We are supposed to second guess her motives, and right from the very beginning she appears to be a young girl who screwed up and is trying to act her way out of her mistake.  She captures the ambiguity rather well, playing to her strengths by trying to seduce others into believing her.

James Stewart is very good here, but he is outshone by Remick and a very seedy George C. Scott (can you say one of the best supporting actors of the late 50's, early 60's).

`Anatomy of a Murder' is a very rewarding cinematic experience, rich with character development (I love the way Stewart is able to create a complete internal change within Paul) and realistic story progression.  The end result is something very entertaining.  I have to say this, it is not as brilliant as some have laid claim to, nor is it something truly groundbreaking; but it is very, very good.  The acting is all spot on and the ending in particular is appropriate and adds a nice layer of intrigue as our perceptions of the truth are either confirmed or completely turned on their heads.

I'm not a huge fan of these courtroom type films, but this one sold me, so major props for that.  It also made me really want to read the novel by John D. Voelker.  I'd recommend this without any hesitation.",1239235200,4,2579,4.541125541125541
518245,5,6302800897,"Ok with all the reviews about this, I did some research about this on the web & this is what I got. I  went to 2 different websites to see what the deal is with the Columbia full screen vs wide screen versions that Columbia has on DVD. Region 1 is full screen and region 2 is wide screen.
One website does show the differences clearly - it is a full screen movie as were a lot of movies back then. the aspect is 1:37 - not 1.85. you can see clearly from the images shown that the widescreen version is BADLY CROPPED on the top and bottom. You are missing all kinds of details on the top and bottom. Or are you ? Or were those badly cropped scenes not really supposed to be seen in the film ? Are they not intended to be there ? Is the full frame transfer showing more than intended ?
I have personally viewed both and I am keeping both the full frame and widescreen versions. Each transfer has something more to show be it the top or bottom or left to right. I don't think you can go wrong no matter how you watch it. Whether or not you see more or less isn't quite as important as 'is the film good?' And the answer is YES, this is a GREAT courtroom drama and should be part of every classic movie fans' collection.
There are also many websites which explain the controversy over this. Basically you see the full picture in a full frame print, with more background details while the widescreen print shows it is cropped from the top & bottom. There is an argument that can be made that those background scenes mean nothing and have nothing to do with the image, but again the question is - Did Otto Preminger shoot it this way to show everything ? Or was it really shot in widescreen ? Only Otto knew for sure.
TCM plays a widescreen version - the same as the Region 2 Columbia.
This is a great movie - a supreme courtroom drama with James Stewart and George C Scott. I highly recommend this movie and if you want to get the DVD - any DVD would work. If you get the Region 1 DVD - it is arguably the original aspect and should ignore the modified at the beginning. Or get the Region 2 or just watch the TCM version and enjoy it in a widescreen transfer.
I know which websites do the comparisons and each reviewer has valid reasoning to how its show. The ultimate answer is just own the movie and enjoy it no matter how much picture you get :)",1229472000,10,2343,4.12691466083151
518246,5,6302800897,"I've been watching the entire Otto Preminger catalog lately, and I got around to seeing what is arguably his most famous film.  Seeing it again makes me realise that it's a masterpiece of tension, performances, dialogue, and cinematography.

There is so much to like about this film.  Nothing here in the trial or the characterisations is present in black and white (there's even a dialogue by Stewart to a potential witness about how people aren't black and white).  It is full blown ambiguity, resulting in a far more grown up and mature film than most current courtroom dramas are.  It is also refreshingly un-PC, unlike modern courtroom dramas.  I like to constrast this film with overblown, incredibly melodramatic shows like The Practice, which I used to watch simply because it was unintentionally hilarious, because everyone was so over the top (and this was before it changed into Boston Legal with William Shatner, the ultimate ham sandwich of an actor).  Preminger's film is one of his masterworks, a great study of the legal system, a fascinating case of two intelligent, well equipped lawyers having a go for a somewhat sleazy client, and a very dramatic and stunning film.

Stewart is masterful here, playing the usual Jimmy Stewart character but with a more cynical side which suits him very well.  Ben Gazarra is great as a bullying, prone to violence soldier, and Remick is outstanding as his hoochie, borderline slutty wife.  Scott as a district attorney is mesmerizing in one of his first roles.  Even the supporting performances are outstanding, with Murray Hamilton excellent as a bartender, Eve Arden as Stewart's secretary, and Joseph Welch, who is the judge of the case.  Despite the fact that you will probably figure out how the jury will rule, the film is still rivetting.  The confrontation between Remick and Scott is incredibly tense (enhanced by Preminger's long take style), and the final cross examination by Scott and a surprise witness is totally devastating.

Otto Preminger is very underrrated in cinema circles today, and I hope that opinion changes soon.  This is one of his best films, and one of the best courtroom dramas ever made.  It still holds up, despite scores of imitations and the explicitness of today's courtroom dramas.",1218585600,2,2272,5.018666666666666

Fishing seems to have replaced legal work and as the film opens his long time secretary (Arden) is asking for enough money to cover her pay check. He needs a case to bring in some fees. Laura Manion (Remick) shows up looking for a lawyer to defend her Army officer husband, Lt. Frederick Manion (Gazzara) who is accused of murdering a local bartender who apparently raped Mrs. Manion. Nothing seems to be like it appears. A lie detector test on Mrs. Manion says one thing and the forensic evidence taken after the alleged rape seems to say the opposite. They seem to be happily married but Mrs. Manion is often seen in public without her husband and in the company of other men. Lt. Manion seems a solid citizen soldier but is he always that way in private? Can Stewart defend him on the basis of temporary insanity? A great performance by Stewart as well as by everyone else with many surprise turns. As great as Stewart's performance is, the movie would not be what is without a terrific, albeit somewhat minor, performance by Joseph Welch as the retired judge who is filling in for the regular judge.

518287,5,6302800897,"Anatomy of a Murder (Otto Preminger, 1957)

To call Anatomy of a Murder the definitive courtroom film is, perhaps, not going quite far enough. Sure, there had been others, and there are certainly other classic courtroom dramas, but Anatomy of a Murder seems to be the basis for the outpouring of courtroom films and TV shows we have today; the bickering of the lawyers, the badgering of the witnesses, the bamboozling of the jury.

The plot is very straightforward, compared to Law and Order or CSI: a man (Ben Gazzara) kills his wife (Lee Remick)'s rapist. A down-on-his-luck lawyer, Paul Biegler (James Stewart) is handed the case soon after he lost the county prosecutor election to Claude Dancer (George C. Scott). Biegler takes the case, as much to get one up on Dancer as for the case itself, but while things, as Biegler believed, are not as open-and-shut as they seem, there's far more to the case than he originally thought, and none of it seems to be on his side.

It should go without saying that courtroom-drama-TV-show fans should consider this a must-see, but even if you never once watch Jerry Orbach flip a badge or William Petersen crack wise, this is a bang-up movie. The bast are phenomenal, every last one of them, and Wendell Mayes' script (adapted from Robert Traver's novel) is top-notch. Nowadays, the direction looks very familiar; that's because it's been done so much since. Despite that, however, the film still looks fresh and exciting. (My hypothesis is that this is because the film is in black and white, and we're used to seeing it in color with deodorant commercials interrupting it every fifteen minutes.) It's witty, it's intelligent, and it's got a cracking good mystery. Besides, how can you not like a film that was banned in Chicago? **** ",1206403200,4,1779,4.822950819672132

The US DVD box from Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment contradicts this, saying:
""This film is presented in a FULL SCREEN VERSION which preserves the original theatrical aspect ratio, approximately 1:33:1.""

In civil society, this may be called false advertising.  The box does not contain what the box says it contains.

The DVD itself warns as it begins playing that the film ""has been modified to fit your TV"".  In other words, it was re-edited in the 80s or 90s by another (anonymous) director/editor using the notorious 'pan and scan' technique, which cuts off the right and left edges of widescreen films, and adds new camera movements and re-scales some images to make certain that the action remains on screen in the new, square-ish ratio.

Amazon's Internet Movie Database correctly identifies the aspect ratio.  Columbia distributes THAT version in Europe (which is why when you search for this film on Amazon, the European release comes up too).  If you buy that version in the US, you'll pay a little more, and you'll have to use a region-free dvd player to view it.  Here's the link for that version:

Oh, I did chuckle quite a bit watching Jimmy Stewart say ""panties"" a lot.  This was probably a book and movie inspired by the Perry Mason phenomenon.  If anything watching this movie tells me that the judicial system of the 1950s was very scary.  An irrational impulse was a legal defense?  Say what?  Doesn't that cover every crime ever committed?  You know right from wrong, but you do it anyway because you can't fight the impulse?  And what about introducing a witness, with a long criminal record with heresay material in the final hour?  Forget that the man wasn't on any witness list.  Then again neither was Ms. Pilant.  What about the veil suggests that the rape victim deserved what she got becase she didn't wear a girdle?

And why would you get a client to sign a promissory note after you get them off as opposed to before?  Anyway, Jimmy Stewart, George C. Scott and Lee Remick were good.

A woman calls to ask Paul to represent her husband, who is in jail for shooting the man who raped her. Milk comes in a glass bottle, the cream on the top is used for coffee. Paul meets the wife Laura Manion, who has been beaten. Then he talks to her husband, the army lieutenant. Both he and his wife married after being divorced. The Lt. Manion tells his story. Paul explains the defenses to a murder charge. Then he talks to Laura. She tells what happened that night and reveals her personality.

518318,5,6302800897,"""Anatomy of a Murder"" is a solid courtroom drama set in the rural Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Shot in stark black and white, AM has an ominous aura from the opening scene.  Ben Gazzara is an Army lieutenant who kills the bar owner who supposedly raped his wife (Lee Remick).  There is no question who committed the murder, only if the act was defensible. Also in doubt is who is telling the complete truth, who deserves sympathy-or punishment- or even if an actual rape occurred.  How consensual was Remick? That Remick is neither the most sympathetic of victims nor Remick/Gazzara the most upstanding couple add to the mystery. The pair is not to be confused with Ozzie and Harriet!  Jimmy Stewart is the small town lawyer who agrees to defend Gazzara. JS bases his case on the slippery premise of temporary insanity. AM soon enough turns into a duel between Jimmy and hot shot mouthpiece George C. Scott-brought up from the ""big town"" of Lansing to prosecute BG.  The in court duel between the lawyers is as good as will be found on any silver screen, as is the out of court scramble to produce witnesses and gather evidence. Listen to the infections in Stewart's voice! This reviewer was initially leery of the 160 minute run time, but length is not an issue here. Viewer interest is certain to be maintained. (According to an old ""Variety"" review, Director/Producer Otto Preminger insisted on releasing AM quickly, leaving no time to edit or cut). The supporting cast is outstanding, notably Arthur O'Connell and Eve Arden playing Stewart's assistants.  AM received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor (Stewart), Best Supporting Actor (Scott and O'Connell) and Best Adapted Screenplay- all to no avail. 1959 was the year of ""Ben Hur"". Tom O'Neil's ""Movie Awards"" states ""the Oscar runways were greased for ""Ben Hur"".  Cynics will love AM.  Guilt or innocence is highly subjective here. The final scene with Stewart and O'Connell in the trailer camp where Remick and Gazarra lived is a gem. It captures the ambiguity of AM perfectly. On a final note, the black and white format is a huge part of the movie.

Combining excellence from all aspects of the production, it's relevence as a story-both in sheer fundamental formalism and subjective psychological, legal realism-emphasizes it's essential artistry.
The appeal of a show like Law & Order lies in it's unification of the formula and the particular circumstances of that week, impelling our complex society as a mirror unto itself, and a film like Anatomy of a Murder succeeds in this and by drawing itself in shades of gray under cloudy skies against the rigors of law.
James Stewart, Lee Remick, George C. Scott and Joseph N. Welch are great here. Great performances that propell the murder trial of an Army Lieutenant who killed a bar owner who the Lieutenant's wife (Remick) says raped and beat her. That's all I feel is necessary to say about the plot. See this for it's technical and envigorating fleshing out of the tale, executed beautifully.
I knew in the first eight minutes that this was a classic, (the legendary Saul Bass' title sequence almost guaranteed it.) Whether the performances, the cinematography, the amazing score by Duke Ellington (who makes a cameo as a band leader, Pie Eye), the crisp courtroom dialogue, in particular between Stewart and Scott, or Remick's ambiguous tramp/femme fatale....
A note of note: Joseph N. Welch, who is terrific as the out-of-town judge, was the lawyer for the Army during the Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954, particularly famous for rebuking Senator McCarthy; ""Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?""
Five years after that, what with the maniacal onus of Otto Preminger, a film like this illuminated the significance of law, as the site where the infintely complicated lives of individuals are wrung through the system we've established to buffer ourselves as we progress into the abyss.",1171065600,3,1962,5.058641975308642

518324,4,6302800897,"""Anatomy of a Murder""(1959) is a riveting courtroom drama that has kept my interest for 160 minutes. Jimmy Stewart was a shining star as a small town lawyer. A former ADA, he took a job as a defender for a jealous army lieutenant (Ben Gazarra - now, he WAS a revelation and an extremely attractive man back in 1959) who pleads innocent in murdering the rapist of his very seductive young wife (Lee Remick). There is no doubt that he did the killing. The question is what strategy and tactics his lawyer will choose for his defense?

The other joy of ""Anatomy of a Murder"" is George C. Scott in a role of ADA Claude Dancer. The gripping exchanges between Scott and Stewart literally keep the viewers on the edge of their seats. Both actors received well deserved Oscar nominations as well as Arthur O'Connell who played Stewart's drinking loyal friend, Parnell. The film is masterfully shot by Otto Preminger and features a brilliant music by Duke Ellington. ""Anatomy of a Murder"" is based on a seemingly simple story of a real life 1952 slaying at the Lumberjack Tavern in Big Bay, Michigan. It is packed with excitement, controversy, passion and intrigue where nothing and no one are what they seem.

518325,4,6302800897,"'Anatomy of a Murder' illustrates vividly how one lawyer repeatedly faces the heat of a controversial rape-case courtroom battle... The film might be Stewart's finest performance... For his magnificent achievement, Stewart was nominated for an Academy Award... The film itself received a total of seven Oscars in various categories, but was overtaken by William Wyler's 'Ben-Hur', the blockbuster of that year, whose star, Charlton Heston, beat out Stewart for best actor...

'Anatomy of a Murder' is one of the few great racy courtroom melodramas ever put on the screen... It is a study of characters superbly detailed, in which a simple country lawyer zealously defends a young Army lieutenant charged with clearly gunning down a bar-owner who, he alleges, raped his young wife... The murder takes place some time after Remick tells her husband (Gazzara) she was raped-enough time to suggest that the killing was not done in the heat of passion but with some deliberation...

Stewart, a warm bachelor lawyer with an old-fashioned grace of manner, is wonderfully believable as the qualified defense attorney, who tries to establish whether or not Lee Remick has been raped... He masterfully guides his defendant to the most exciting climax, repeatedly drawing forth evidence which he knows to be inadmissible, but which he wants the jury to hear...

Stewart smokes cheap cigars, plays jazz piano, and restrains beautifully Remick's flirtatious overtures, but his benevolence is never in question... We see him hauling the provocative Remick from out of the bar telling her to be a good, and submissive housewife for the court...

Stewart studies with a cynical eye the peculiar traits of the accused, tolerates, with amused resignation, his friend's drunken lapses, and competently makes his point to the judge and jury...

Ben Gazzara proves to be a problematic client, close to uncooperative with his lawyer... Also, it is very clear that he is a jealously possessive man, which is enough to question the validity of the rape charge, he claims that he acted in a moment of insane anger... The film raises fascinating legal highlights on disorders of jealousy...

Lee Remick gives a sensational performance as the sexy wife whose missing panties form a vital part of the evidence...

Remick knows how to attract and seduce... She is so coquettish that she drives her angry husband to murder... The trial poses tricky questions: Was the Remick character in advanced levels of seduction during her wanderings at the neighborhood bar? Did her bruises come from the man whom she claimed raped her, or from her jealous husband?

George C. Scott plays the sly, sardonic prosecuting attorney who offers the character a wonderful air of arrogance and superiority, unnerving with his aggressive antagonism witnesses and defense attorney...

Arthur O'Connell rises to the occasion when his lawyer-hero needs him...

Eve Arden is Stewart's faithful and efficient secretary eager that the Manion case might bring her a long-overdue paycheck...

The courtroom fencing between Stewart and Scott is so convincing with the casting of Joseph N. Welch as the delightful ever-patient judge, Harlan Weaver... Judge Weaver, whose patience is repeatedly tried by the grotesque gestures of the lawyers in the case, appears too kindly to be much of a courtroom disciplinarian... But in the tension between the shrewd old judge and the lawyer for defense, the film raises a crucial issue on the rules of advocacy: To what extent a lawyer should represent a client zealously within the rules and norms of courtroom etiquette?

Preminger's penchant for long takes and a mobile camera, rather than cuts and conversational reaction shots, here serves both to illuminate the crucial ambiguities in the characters, and to facilitate an objective appraisal of the mechanics of the legal process...

Preminger challenges the American censors over the candid sexual terminology and explicit examination of rape in his courtroom drama... Ellington's score brilliantly captures the tension and the moral ambiguity that characterize the movie... Sam Leavitt's black-and-white photography is particularly impressive, setting as it does the stark mood of the authentic Michigan locations...",1166313600,2,4253,5.339312406576981

518358,5,6302800897,"Anatomy of a Murder with James Stewart is not just another tired old story about a Jury struggling to reach a just and proper verdict.  Its not just about lawyers doing legal battle in the courtroom against insurmountable odds.  No it is percisely because the ""Anatomy of a Murder"" DVD is so much more than the sum of its parts it would be difficult \ impossible for me to explain why it is so awesome in a full meaningful way in this so limited forum.

In the context of speaking about a suspected rape the word panties was used in the movie.  Now you must understand this movie was made in the 1950's when such things had a shock value all their own.  When Anatomy of a Murder was made Rape, Panties, the motives of low common rakish men driven by base vulgar carnal animal passions or  other such subjects suggestive of anything even remotely sexual were never talked about with the directness and candor found in the movie.

More than that the story told by Anatomy of a Murder is woven as a wonderful tale of small town bar room dives, fallen vampish ladies, seedy men and drunken sots all clamoring without much success to retain a already shreded razor thin vaneer of pseudo-respectiability.  Anatomy of a Murder is at once both a delightful mystery and a suspenseful thiller for those would would rather think about all the many dimensions and layers of intrique going on in a movie rather than be spoon fed a formulaic plot.

The especially fine part about Anatomy of a Murder is that it explores and lays bare the most horrid sort of people without the movie itself becoming trashy or sensational.  Anatomy of a Murder manages to stay at all times respectable making you more than comfortable watching BUT, the people you see are so real muddling on with their tired flawed individualistic or selfish senses of humanity.

Anatomy of a Murder is funny, tragic and sad yet not a downer because, you kind of like the people.  I am sure anyone watching the movie will see in the charcters people we have seen or know today which keeps subject matter in Anatomy of a Murder fresh even after all these years since it was made.

To enjoy this movie you must have at least some thinking skills because the characters are rich and dynamic.  In Anatomy of a Murder Truth is one man's darling, another man's mistress sometimes loved other times set out on the street with the rubbish.  What happens when a good girl goes bad, can the village vixen have even a hint of virtue.  Who knows what happens on an innocent ride home when for many of their own different convoluted reasons truth remains nothing but a nodding aquintance to every character you meet in Anatomy of a Murder.

Even Jimmy Stewart known for his good guy roles as the lawyer in Anatomy of a Murder is not always without taint he reveals that exposure a harlots song long enough will even stir the recesses of his soul.  As I said this movie is interesting and rich on many levels if you want to know more you just have to buy the movie at Amazon.com like I did.  Tell you what, Anatomy of a Murder is one of the better movies in my collection.",1162684800,2,3110,4.472566371681416

Love how he changes Point-of-view and how he engages us in a courtroom battle.  Brilliant staging, great performances...all typical Preminger.  Do I believe the guy raped Lee Remick?  Yes I do.  Do I believe Lee Remick likes to lead men on and hungers for the attention of men?  Absolutely!  Do I believe Ben Gazarra was in his ""right mind"" when he murdered the guy?

518360,5,6302800897,"Using a popular novel by an actual attorney, director Otto Preminger pushed the bounds of 1959 American movie censorship by directing and producing one of the most frank, hard-hitting, and engrossing films of the 1950's.  It was certainly the most adult film that James Stewart had made up to that time and, given his preference for ""family films"" in later years, this may have been the most shocking film of his career.  Its honesty and innovations are such that it remains remarkably realstic and relevant today.

Filmed mostly on location in and around Marquette, Michigan (on the picturesque Upper Peninsula, near Lake Superior), ""Anatomy of a Murder"" has few dull moments, if any.  It is certainly one of the most accurate, authentic courtroom dramas ever filmed, especially since the judge is played by the legendary attorney Joseph Welch, who had presided over the Army-McCarthy Senate hearings of 1954.  Welch is absolutely delightful and fascinating to watch, a true natural in his portrayal of a ""country judge.""

James Stewart is the defense attorney in the story, defending Ben Gazzara's character, who is accused of murdering the man who allegedly raped his wife (played by the sexy and beautiful Lee Remick).  He matches wits with a prosecuting attorney played by George C. Scott in one his earliest major roles.  The legal sparring between the two attorneys, sometimes including a local prosecutor, makes for great drama.

Stewart is aided by a crusty, alcholic, older attorney played by veteran actor Arthur O'Connell, and his wise-cracking, sarcastic secretary, played by Eve Arden, who was then best known for her work on the long-running ""Our Miss Brooks"" television series.

As Stewart does some investigation of the case, he visits an inn that is run by Kathyrn Grant, who was actually Kathryn Crosby in real life.  He eventually learns an amazing secret from Miss Grant.

Adding to the delight of the film is an encounter with the one-and-only jazz musician Duke Ellington, who also composed the syncopated, magical music for the production.  Stewart was a gifted amateur musician and, when he sits down at the piano with Ellington, there is a special, quite enjoyable treat.

Otto Preminger continually strived for greater originality and innovation in his films.  Known for his autocratic direction, Preminger nevertheless sought to make more realstic films as he battled with those who wanted to keep Hollywood within strict moral bounds.

Preminger obviously recognized that Hollywood needed to tell the truth, even if it might be unpleasant or disturbing.  Perhaps the presence of James Stewart helped to make the mention of women's underwear and even rape more palatable during the trial in this rather controversial film.  It may be hard for younger viewers to imagine that this film was quite incredible for 1959, especially in America; only the French and Italian filmmakers were able to go farther during the 1950's.  Perhaps things have gone too far in recent years, but this film is clearly honest and realistic.

The stark black and white photography adds to the atmosphere of the Upper Peninsula location filming, particularly in the scenes in the woods, around the lake, and even the towns.  Overall, this remains a very entertaining and fascinating film.",1153785600,,3292,5.150375939849624
518361,2,6302800897,"I fairly enjoyed the quaint opening of the movie with Jimmy fishing and reminiscing with his legal eagle pal.  However, then

the problem of the endless rehashing of the rape began, and the antiquated ideas about ""provocation of rape"" were ceaselessly unpealed.  Leading to courtroom discussions about how she was dressed, how she acted, if she flirted.  Reflections of a bygone era when a crime wasn't a crime, but may have been a crime depending on the height of the skirt line.  But even worse than that is the ungodly length of court room banter, often sound and fury which disappointingly led to nothing at the end.  No smoking gun or interesting twist or clues to successfully assemble.  Just a court full of knicker snickerers and a trial that supposedly hinged on the prosecutor's awareness of  the victims paternal history.  Nonsense, and 3 hours down the tubes. However, the movie gets two stars for the clever and alert interjections of the judge, and the appearance of a young George C.

518362,5,6302800897,"This is a classic 1950s murder and courtroom drama flick of the first order. Jimmie Stewart plays the lead as a laid-back country lawyer as much into fishing as law, who gets handed a red-hot murder defense case. The local prosecutor brings in a big-gun outside Deputy State Attorney General (George C. Scott) to stomp on Stewart, and the fun begins... It is David vs. Goliath time in the courtroom!

Lee Remick is really good as the town floozy, whose boyfriend (Ben Gazzara) shot a local man who allegedly molested his girl. I thought that Joseph N. Welch, as Judge Weaver, was particularly good, and in fact he was hilariously authentic. (If only more real judges were like him...)

This film manages to be both funny and authentic, and avoids crossing the line into slapstick. The courtroom drama is more or less technically correct, although few lawyers are as skillful as Stewart and Scott are in this film. Although the law on ""irrestistable impulse"" has changed since this film, that fact detracts not at all from what is an engaging story and enjoyable viewing experience.

As the plot develops, we are never quite certain who is telling the truth, who deserves punishment, who is taking the law into his or her hands?

518364,5,6302800897,"It would seem that 1959's ANATOMY OF A MURDER was the first film to break the Hollywood ""production code"" in terms of using sexual terminology on screen.  Watching the movie makes one begin to understand how Hitchcock's PSYCHO happened a year later.  Otto Preminger (whose movie about drug abuse, THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM, had challenged the code in 1955) in ANATOMY OF A MURDER tells the story of lately unsuccessful bachelor lawyer Paul Biegler, who takes up the task of defending young Army Lieutenant Manion, who murdered his wife's rapist.  As Biegler, who though easygoing (he loves jazz) is no fool, James Stewart gives an intense performance.  The hard-boiled reporter of CALL NORTHSIDE 777 is there in his characterization, as is the Jefferson Smith (of MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON)-type idealist.  As Laura Manion, Lee Remick is perfect, providing just the right amount of ambiguity (did this ""voluptuous"" woman subtly lead her rapist on?  Is her marriage really so happy?) to make her character as fascinating as is Stewart's.  Likewise, Ben Gazzara's Manion is hardly a sympathetic convict:  he may have been justified in his crime, but he may also be a wife-beater.  Riveting performances are given by George C. Scott as the prosecuting attorney, Claude Dancer, and Murray Hamilton as a witness for the prosecution.  Just as his surname suggests, the big-city lawyer ""dances"" around the issues, rarely posing direct questions - yet he is so suave, dignified, and (at first) deferential in his manner that one scarcely notices how devious he is; his strength lies in this.  Hamilton stands out as the murder victim's friend, who tries to save his memory but who withers in the face of Biegler's merciless questions.  And this realist film contains two performances by non-actors:  McCarthy era attorney Joseph N. Welch is delightfully natural as the judge; Duke Ellington, who wrote the movie's score, has a cameo as Biegler's jazz musician pal.  Some may find Ellington's jazz score wrong for a small-town courtroom drama, but I think it appropriate on two counts.  First, it is motivated by the protagonist's love of jazz, and second, it fits the sophisticated nature of the film's subject matter.  To sum up:  both as a daring `50's movie and as a standard-setter in edge-of-your-seat courtroom drama, ANATOMY OF A MURDER is essential viewing.",1139788800,5,2362,5.062015503875969
518365,5,6302800897,"The dark underbelly of Jimmy Stewart's aw-shucks screen image was rarely put to better use than in Otto Preminger's ""Anatomy of a Murder."" If anyone could make a cunning defense attorney sympathetic, it's the man who made us like a voyeur in ""Rear Window"" and a borderline psychotic in ""Vertigo."" In ""Anatomy,"" Stewart plays Paul Biegler, a fairly ordinary small-town lawyer who would just as soon fish and drink as ply his trade. However, when he falls into a high-profile murder case involving an Army lieutenant (Ben Gazzara) who has murdered a saloon owner for allegedly raping his wife (Lee Remick), a sharper, almost imperceptible edge emerges. Stewart is so lovable that we barely notice that he helps his client craft a rather insincere defense and uses his down-home persona to manipulate the audience and even the judge as he does battle with the ""big city"" prosecutors.

As with his best work for Hitchcock, we are suckers for Stewart's two-toned humanism: We delight in the contrast between his piano playing and good-natured interactions with an aging drinking buddy (Arthur O'Connell) and the consistently devious craftiness he displays in the courtroom. Not that there aren't many other reasons to like ""Anatomy of a Murder."" The stellar cast, including George C. Scott and also real-life McCarthy nemesis Joseph N. Welch as the judge; a fabulous soundtrack by Duke Ellington, who makes a cameo appearance; the strategically leisurely pace of Preminger's direction; the evocative black and white cinematography; the memorable title sequence by Saul Bass. Ultimately, though, it's Stewart's show.

If the movie is presented in an ""Unmatted Full-Screen"" format, then the film negative aspect ratio was probably 1.37:1 (almost 4:3), and almost none of the original theatrical image has been removed for exhibition on a 4:3 television screen.  For theatrical exhibition, the image would have been ""matted"" (partially covered from the top down and bottom up) to produce a 1.85:1 image.  For exhibition on a 4:3 television screen, the ""mattes"" would simply be removed.  So the DVD exhibition would actually show 25.9 percent more image than the theatrical exhibition.  The movie may have been filmed this way so that the theatrical image wouldn't be butchered on television by the ""Pan&Scan"" process, and because the filmmakers didn't foresee the current state of the home video market (which didn't really exist in 1959), where consumers prefer movies presented in their theatrical aspect ratio, rather than in a ratio in which the image will fill up their 4:3 television screen (if there is a difference).  Or, it may be that the filmmakers didn't want to work with anamorphic lenses.  As an ""Unmatted Full-Screen"" formatted DVD, this DVD would present the movie in the aspect ratio in which the filmmakers wanted people to see it on a 4:3 television, but it would not present the movie in the aspect ratio in which the filmmakers wanted people to see it in a movie theater (for that, the DVD would have to present the movie in a ""matted widescreen"" format).  On the other hand, if this movie was shot in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio, then 27.9 percent of the original theatrical image has been removed for the DVD exhibition, so that the DVD image fills your entire 4:3 television screen (theatrical aspect ratio - 1.85:1; DVD aspect ratio - 4:3).

Stewart is so natural, so real, and so immensely likable. He's the kind of guy you wish you could have in your family, but wily enough to argue a good defense in court.
Lee Remick has just the right amount of provocative sensuality as Laura Manion to make one wonder what exactly happened on the ""fateful night"" in question.
After playing Southern belles in both ""A Face in the Crowd"" (1957) and ""The Long Hot Summer"" (1958), Remick was offered the role of Laura because Lana Turner, who was supposed to play the part, refused to wear an ""off-the-rack"" wardrobe, and wanted dresses designed by Jean Louis (hardly what a Army wife would be wearing). It was a big break for Remick, and she makes the most of it.
The entire supporting cast is superb: Ben Gazzara as the intense Lt. Manion, Arthur O'Connell as Biegler's assistant and friend, Eve Arden as Biegler's loyal secretary. George C. Scott is Dancer, the Assistant State Attorney, and Joseph N. Welch, who gained fame for being the Special Counsel for the Army in the Army-McCarthy Congressional hearings, is a delight as Judge  Weaver. Duke Ellington makes a cameo appearance as Pie Eye, and even Muffy the beer drinking dog does a great job. Otto Preminger's direction flows at a lovely pace, with a balance between the dramatic tension and thoughtful scenes tinged with humor.
There were Oscar nominations for Best Actor, Supporting Actor (both O'Connell and Scott), Picture, and Editing (all losing to ""Ben Hur""), as well as Sam Leavitt's beautiful b&w cinematography (lost to ""The Diary of Anne Frank"") and Wendell Mayes marvelous screenplay adaptation of the Robert Traver best-seller (lost to ""Room at the Top""), proving that 1959 was a great year at the movies.
I love courtroom dramas, and this is one of the best ever made; it's unpredictable, with a very authentic feel to it, perhaps because the author, using the pen name of ""Robert Traver"", was actually Michigan Supreme Court Justice John D. Voelker.

518393,5,6302800897,"Otto Preminger was one of the most creative and brave directors of the american cinema in the fifties and sixties.
His works were loaded with a ravishing realism , they were very expilict , challenging and disturbing .
Imagine what it means the plot around the adultery commited by the wife of an officer in that age . You can reply me with From here to the eternity but this film is more shocking , and overcomes in dramatic punch to From here ...The other examples you may think is Baby doll and Dial M for murder in the fifties, but this one wins the match.
The powerful sequence in the Court has only a serious match in The Nuremberg judgement . Never before there was not a previous film so disturbing like this that film  who explicitly turned around the bitter and awful consequences about the adultery .
The plot is overwhelming , magnificient built , without any hole . The cast is incredible . Consider these giants actors as Ben Gazzara , George C. Scott , Arthur O'Donell, James Stewart and Lee Remick in her screen debut .
This film was nominated as the best film but was unlucky , because Ben Hur literally won all the prizes and somehow that fact stroke the undeniable virtues of that superb work.
However the time seems to set in the right place this picture.
Acquire this one.
One of the most remarkable films in the american cinema story.
If I could give this film ten thousand stars , I 'd do it .",1087603200,4,1416,4.38403041825095
518394,5,6302800897,"This tense courtroom drama combines elements of suspense, sensuality, comedy, and intellect to deliver a wonderfully captivating film. The characters are the driving force of this film, with James Stewart obviously leading the cast as defense attorney Paul Biegler. Lee Remick is perfect in the role of flirtatious, sexy, lower-class blond Laura Manion, whose husband murdered the man who raped her. Ben Gazzara plays Frederick Manion, who pleads temporary insanity to the murder, although both Stewart and the audience know his crime was quite deliberate. George C. Scott delivers a cutting performance as the big-city lawyer who lashes into Manion, only to have Manion lash back. Eve Arden plays Biegler's loyal secretary, and Arthur O'Connell rounds out the cast as Biegler's alcoholic friend.
Unlike many Hollywood courtroom dramas that FEEL like Hollywood courtroom dramas, this film possesses a realism that most others lack. The film was very controversial at the time of its 1959 release because of the ""graphic"" descriptions of the rape. I find trivia like this especially interesting because it helps me see the evolution of film over the decades. I love movies that strive for elements of realism; however, I hate contemporary films that feel compelled to shock audiences beyond belief in their ""realism."" This film accomplishes that goal without the grotesque and obscene style of many of today's courtroom dramas.

518395,5,6302800897,"Otto Preminger is probably one of the least understood and under appreciated directors from the 1940's -1960's, but truth be known he was responsible for some of the most interesting, popular and well made movies from this era: Anatomy of a Murder, Carmen Jones, The Man with the Golden Arm, Laura, Advise and Consent. He was one of the few directors that could handle serious subject matter with style and grace without becoming preachy and maudlin.
""Anatomy of a Murder"" is one of his best: perfect, spot-on casting, eloquent screenplay, truthful performances, and gorgeous black and white photography. Jimmy Stewart, who seemed to be able to realistically portray anyone from any era and social status, plays a small town lawyer hired to defend a soldier, Ben Gazarra for murdering a man accused of raping his wife, Lee Remick. Gazzara and Remick are first rate but it is a non-actor, real judge Joseph N. Welch who almost steals the movie away from all three principals, which only proves that Preminger was a smart cookie...a smart cookie, indeed.",1066521600,8,1052,4.982954545454546
518426,5,6302800897,"This 1959 courtroom drama starring the incomparable Jimmy Stewart is one of my favorite Stewart films.  Jimmy's portrayal of a defense attorney is spot-on perfect here, in my view.
There's a great supporting cast in force here as well, including Geoge C. Scott, Ben Gazzara, Arthur O'Connell, Eve Arden (hilarious, as always, in the role of Stewart's secretary), Murray Hamilton, Orson Bean, and the always-fetching Lee Remick (whose alluring quality is undeniable in this motion picture).
Keep an eye open for Howard McNear (Floyd the Barber in ""The Andy Griffith Show"") as a witness.  It's quite humorous--and maybe even a tad bit unsettling even--to hear Floyd Lawson on the witness stand, speaking of sexual matters. Mayberry-ites would gasp in shock & horror I imagine.  LOL.
Clocking in at a very lengthy 160 minutes, the film never drags.  It moves at a snappy-enough pace to keep our interest the whole way, with a nice combination of scenes both inside and outside the courtroom.
There's an outstanding Duke Ellington score to propel the action, and as a bonus on the DVD edition, there's a perfectly-fantastic Photo Gallery section of stills from the film, underscored by Ellington's music from the movie.  This is the best and classiest ""Photo Gallery"" extra you're likely to encounter on any DVD product as of this date.
Picture quality on the DVD looks just fine here. Aspect ratio is 1.33:1 (Full Frame), which I know irks the ""Widescreen Only"" crowd.  However, from all the info I can gather, the 1.33 ratio IS indeed the Original Aspect Ratio for this film.  So, it's OK by me, if this is the case.
If ""Anatomy Of A Murder"" is not currently in your DVD collection, you should probably be taken to court by lawyer Stewart for overlooking this fine motion picture experience.  Get it now -- before Jimmy comes after you with a subpoena.  :)",1066348800,10,1854,4.8789808917197455

518428,5,6302800897,"One of James Stewart's greatest roles and movies, Otto Preminger's Anatomy Of A Murder, has him as Paul Biegler, former public prosecutor who spends most of his time fishing.  That is, until his boozing partner Parnell McCarthy tells him about the Manning incident.  A certain Lieutenant Frank Manning shot the owner of a bar, Barney Quill, five times after learning that the latter raped his wife.  That's quite a change in fortunes, according to his secretary Mayda, who tells him, ""What appointments?  People will think you have migrated into the woods.""
Biegler has a rough one.  There are four options to get Manning off the hook:  1) Quill committed suicide, 2) Manning didn't do it, 3) he was legally justified, and 4) it was an excusable killing.  Biegler can't use #3 because of the time element--Manning killed Quill an hour later, which makes it premeditated murder.
Then there's Laura, Manning's luscious wife, described by Mayda as ""soft, easy, the kind of woman men like to take advantage of, and do."" one of those women men like to show off, but may get jealous if too much attention is paid to her.  Laura sticks by her husband all the same.
The courtroom scenes become impassioned with the usual objections called by both sides, to the point that the weary but overly patient judge tells a smart-aleck witness, ""Just answer the question.  The attorneys will provide the wisecracks.""  The best one comes from Biegler at the expense of an expert witness there to observe.  ""Is he here to observe the constellation of Taurus or the life and times of a bumblebee?""  At least it gets a laugh in the courtroom.
Apart from Stewart, Arthur O'Connell, best known as the older cowboy in Bus Stop, does wonders as Parnell.  Lee Remick turns in a sexy but assertive performance as Laura.  This was also one of George C. Scott's early roles.  He is Claude Dancer, assistant attorney general from Lansing, assisting the prosecution.
This movie gained controversy for the then-considered graphic description of the assault in the courtroom, but also when Laura tells Biegler that Quill ""tore my panties off.""  In fact the Hays Code denied the picture a censors certificate, but the Supreme Court wisely permitted the release of the film in 1959.
Duke Ellington's mellowed music serves as a cooling off after the heated court sessions.  Duke himself appears as Pie Eye, piano-playing leader of a band, and he and Stewart share a few bars together.
Eve Arden's tart lines are in plenty supply:  ""If this refrigerator gets any more fish, it'll swim upstream and spawn all by itself.""
Parnell has a great reflective soliloquy on the justice system while Paul plays the piano.  ""Twelve different minds, twelve different hearts, twelve different walks of life, twelve sets of eyes, ears, shapes and sizes, are asked to judge another human being as different as they are from one each other.  In their judgment, they must become of one mind, unanimous.  It must be one of the miracles of man's disorganized minds that they can do it.""  Biegler's attempts to do that is what this movie is about.",1062115200,7,3089,4.854961832061068
518429,5,6302800897,"Otto Preminger, who produced and directed this fine courtroom drama starring James Stewart, Lee Remick, George C. Scott and Ben Gazzara, had a knack for translating best-selling mid-cult novels to the screen (The Man with the Golden Arm (1955); Exodus (1960); Advise and Consent (1962) and others) usually in a nervy manner, sometimes heavy-handed, sometimes pretentious, but always worth a look.  Part of his secret was star power.  Like Hitchcock, he liked to go with big names supported by fine character actors.  And part of his secret was his long experience in both the theater and films going back to the silent film era.  He knew how to put together a movie.  But more than anything it was his near-dictatorial control over the production (something directors seldom have today, and never in big budget films--Preminger's were big budget for his day) that allowed him to successfully capture the movie-going audience at midcentury.
This and Laura (1944) are two of his films that go beyond the merely commercial and achieve something that can be called art.  Seeing this for the first time forty-three years after it was released I was struck by the fine acting all around and the sturdy, well-constructed direction.  James Stewart's performance as the Michigan north country lawyer Paul Biegler might shine even more luminously than it does except for a certain performance by Gregory Peck three years later as a southern country lawyer in the unforgettable To Kill a Mockingbird (1962).  Lee Remick, in a frank, but imperfect imitation of Marilyn Monroe, co-stars as Laura Manion, the wife of army Lt. Frederick Manion (Gazzara) whom Bielger is defending on a murder charge.  The defense is temporary insanity because the man he shot raped his wife.  Bielger slyly gains sympathy for his client by deliberately allowing it to come out that Laura is sexy and flirtatious enough to drive any man crazy.  Indeed, he tricks the prosecution into doing his work for him.  George C. Scott plays Claude Dancer, a big city prosecutor, with snake-like precision while Gazzara manages to combine introspection and cockiness as the young lieutenant.  Fine support comes from Eve Arden (best known as Our Miss Brooks on TV and in the movie of that name) as Biegler's loyal secretary and Arthur O'Connell as his alcoholic mentor.  Kathryn Grant, who gave up a promising film career to marry Bing Crosby and have children, has a modest role as the murdered man's daughter.
I've seen many courtroom dramas, some real, some fictional, since this film first appeared, but I have to say it stands up well.  The action (for the most part) feels realistic and the tension is nicely created and maintained.  The resolution is satisfying and the ending is as sly and subtle as any country lawyer might want.  Incidentally, if this movie had more total votes cast at IMDb, it would rank in the top one hundred of all time, which is where it belongs.
See this for James Stewart whose easy, adroit style under Preminger's direction found full range.  Although he gave many fine performances, I don't think Stewart was ever better than he was here.",1029974400,81,3131,4.954110898661568
518430,2,6302800897,"This was a really strange movie and very long. If you don't like courtroom scenes, steer clear of this film, because it is basically one long courtroom scene. I have to admit it really was handled quite brilliantly, and I give credit to the scriptwriter and the actors who were the lawyers for the fact that it didn't quite put me to sleep. I was amazed that in 1959, the situation about assault, rape, and ripped white panties with ruffles was so freely talked about. I guess the code must have been on its way out even then.
James Stewart was really the best thing about the movie but even he couldn't make it a wonder. The guy who played Pa Kwimper in ""Follow That Dream"" was the sidekick and helped a bit with the case.
I can't say I highly recommend this movie unless you're a diehard fan of James Stewart or courtrooms.",1026518400,5,825,4.363636363636363
518431,5,6302800897,"Based on the famous Traver novel, ANATOMY OF A MURDER is an extremely complex film that defeats easy definition.  In some respects it is a social document of the era in which it was made; primarily, however, it is a detailed portrait of the law at work and the machinizations and motivations of the individuals involved in a seemingly straight-forward case--and in the process it raises certain ethical issues re attorney behavior and the lengths to which an attorney might go to win a case.

Paul Biegler (James Stewart) is a small-town lawyer who has recently lost a re-election for the position of District Attorney and who is down on his luck--when a headline-making case involving assault, alleged rape, and murder drops into his lap.  As the case evolves, there is no question about the identity of the killer.  But a smart lawyer might be able to get him off just the same and redeem his own career in the process, and with the aid of an old friend (Arthur O'Connell) and his formidable secretary (Eve Arden), Biegler sets out to do precisely that.  Opposing him in the courtroom is Claude Dancer (George C. Scott), a high powered prosecutor who is equally determined to get a conviction... and who is no more adverse to coaching a witness than Biegler himself.  The two square off in a constantly shifting battle for the jury, a battle that often consists of underhanded tactics on both sides.

The performances are impressive, with James Stewart ideally cast as the attorney for the defense, Ben Gazzara as his unsavory client, and a truly brilliant Lee Remick as the sexy and disreputable wife who screams rape where just possibly none occurred; O'Connell, Arden, and Scott also offer superior performances.  The script is sharp, cool, and meticulous, the direction and cinematography both effective and completely unobtrusive, and the famous jazz score adds quite a bit to the film as a whole.  Although we can't help rooting for Stewart, as the film progresses it seems more and more likely that Remick is lying through her teeth and Gazzara is as guilty as sin--but the film balances its elements in such a way as to achieve a disturbing ambiguity that continues right through to the end.  If you expect a courtroom thriller with sudden revelations and twists you'll likely be disappointed in ANATOMY OF A MURDER, but if you want a thought-provoking take on the law you'd be hard pressed to find one better.  Recommended.

518466,5,6302800897,"If I'm not mistaken, ANATOMY OF A MURDER is the first Otto Preminger movie which has the honour to enter the DVD market. With Billy Wilder and Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger is one of these german or austrian native directors who built the legend of Hollywood after having left the nazi threat in the thirties. The interesting trailer of ANATOMY OF A MURDER you can find as extra feature on this DVD will give you the opportunity to hear the german accent of an Otto Preminger presenting the main actors of the film to the american audience of 1959. A curiosity for the 2001 movie fan.
ANATOMY OF A MURDER is a masterpiece which has really well stood the test of time. Almost three hours of projection which you won't regret thanks to a perfect screenplay and to outstanding actors such as Ben Gazzara, George C. Scott and naturally James Stewart. One can consider this Otto Preminger production as an adult movie for the audience of that period, the word ""anatomy"" being considered as a metaphor or to the letter. So the evocation by the court of Lee Remick's rape is not censored and described with words one would have hardly imagined in the mouth of a movie legend such as James Stewart.
The modernity of the movie can also be observed in the way Otto Preminger manages to desanctify the ""court movie"" genre. Just imagine that after 165 minutes of suspense, the director doesn't judge necessary to let the audience hear the final conclusions of James Stewart and George C. Scott,the prosecutor. Totally stupefying.
As bonus features, you will enjoy the trailers of ANATOMY OF A MURDER, PHILADELPHIA and A FEW GOOD MEN, incomplete filmographies of the principal actors, three vintage advertisings and different subtitles. The most interesting bonus feature is a photo presentation of ANATOMY OF MURDER that includes numerous features of the director at work and a musical backgroung of Duke Ellington.
Now, be advised that COLUMBIA TRI-STAR has decided to present you this movie with the artistic butchery of the PAN & SCAN process so one of the most important scenes of ANATOMY OF MURDER , when George C. Scott tries to stress Lee Remick by standing right in front of her so that she can not see the signs of her lawyer James Stewart, loses a great deal of impact.

518468,5,6302800897,"Otto Preminger's Anatomy Of A Murder was considered very controversial at the time of its release in 1959.  The story revolves around a small town lawyer (Jimmy Stewart) defending a young soldier (Ben Gazzara) who is accused of murder.  The defense lies n the fact that Mr. Stewart is trying to prove justifiable homicide as he was reacting to the raping of his wife (Lee Remick).  The subject of rape had never been so openly discussed on film before.  The use of the word panties was considered quite risqu&eacute; at the time.  While today this sort of stuff appears on public television and seems quite tame, if you put yourself back into that more conservative time, you can see the movie is quite steamy.  Aside from the controversy, it is an excellent court room drama with Mr. Stewart at his everyman best.  A young George C.

I suppose this would be good for someone that hasn't read the book, but if you have you will be fairly disappointed.",1524182400,,534,4.105769230769231

The characters were interesting, the performances were strong across the board, and I like the opposition between the two sides. Some nice twists and some questionable motives. I hope you'll enjoy this film too.",1522886400,,302,4.716981132075472
7831959,5,6302800897,"Anatomy of a Murder is one of the best films ever made. It is based on the classic Robert Traver's courtroom drama with the same name. The book was first published in 1958 and the film was produced a year later in 1959. Although it is about 60-years-old, it is still great, in no way dated, with an excellent plot and acting, and very riveting. The courtroom drama, especially the cross-examinations are very clever, filled with tension and suspense.
It is about a small-town lawyer, now broke and interested in fishing, who was defeated as the town prosecutor after serving in the position for ten years. He takes on what seems to be an unwinnable open and shut case of a young army lieutenant who claims that he shot and killed a local tavern owner because the man raped his wife. The problems faced by the lawyer (played superbly by James Stewart) include: what really happened, how after his client confessed can he get the jury to find his client innocent, was the lieutenants wife really raped, why does the lieutenant seem to dislike his wife and not even allow her to touch him, doesnt the wife (Lee Remick) act as a flirt and isn't she somehow to blame for what may have occurred since she went to the tavern many nights when her husband is asleep, how can the small town lawyer beat a highly-seasoned lawyer (George C. Scott) brought in especially to beat the lawyer by the new town prosecutor who beat him recently in the election.
The film was nominated for seven Oscars, including best picture, and should have won.",1521072000,,1528,4.6007326007326

7831963,5,6302800897,"Probably the best courtroom drama ever made, and so far ahead of its time its scary. Acting is flawless and Otto Preminger`s direction is nothing short of genius, in fact James Stewart`s father thought it was a disgrace and ran an ad in his local newspaper condemning it, and Stewart was in his late 40`s, he wasn't a kid!  The only sad part is that most people have never heard of it.",1518566400,,385,4.347222222222222

7831965,5,6302800897,"This was my first Jimmy Stewart movie besides Its a Wonderful Life which Ive watched bits and pieces of throughout the years. He was way before my time so it never occurred to me that actually made movies worth watching before I was born, lol. But I got curious when I recognized him on the cover and decided to give it a shot. I am so glad I did, it was absolutely fantastic and now I cant get enough of pre-1980s movies. Im now a huge Stewart fan and have seen quite a few in the last year or so but this is still my first and my favorite. I just cant see how anyone wouldnt like this one,",1517529600,,591,3.9747899159663866
