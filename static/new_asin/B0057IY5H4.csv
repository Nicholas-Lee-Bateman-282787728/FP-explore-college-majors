4596790,5,B0057IY5H4,"It's a wonderful look at some of the great shows of the 1940's through the 1960's. It even has a Sea Hunt episode. It has a whole DVD devoted to the Nelsons(Ozzie & Harriet). It has several episodes of the Ed Gwynn Show, Dick Van Dyke, Petticoat Junction, The Buster Keaton Show, and Danny(Donald) O'Keefe (whoever he is) Lassie and even one episode of Sky King.
This is a great smattering of TV history without the stupid shows that some of the DVD's have. I have enjoyed watching all of the programs that I have viewed so far.",1422662400,14,528,4.3979591836734695
