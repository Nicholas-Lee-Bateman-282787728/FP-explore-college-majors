5109367,1,B007RVUDP2,"I am so sorry I bought this DVD....very long and boring movie.  Save your money! It was late at night and I bought this on a sudden impulse. I wish I had read the reviews....some okay reviews, but some not so good.  Nothing chilling about movie at all.",1350950400,,252,4.229166666666667
5109368,3,B007RVUDP2,"I think this is more of a character or morality play than a ghost story.  I liked it.  Bad title, bad marketing, good acting, good story.",1349654400,,137,4.230769230769231

5109373,3,B007RVUDP2,"This was a good little who-done-it,We would always blame people dwelling in a haunted house or ghosts in the least.

The cast was was very real as a family unit,Facing a tragedy head on.

Some of the family has died and the father wants answers and goes to a NIGEL LYTHGOE looking spirit medium.

The shocking revelations and Ghost effects are worth watching .",1343174400,2,360,4.59375
5109374,4,B007RVUDP2,"In an isolated farm house, George (Kenneth G. Hodgson) believes his family has been killed by a ghost. He hires Robert Brandon (Paul McEwan) a man who believes he is a medium, but works for a company that uses ""smoke and mirrors."" The movie is sharp and crisp until Robert manages to conjure up the ghosts of Robert's family. At this point you ask, ""What happened to the ghost makeup?"" Each ghost tells a different story of the events of the murders/killings.

Denise Cooke plays the wife Gillian. The son, who is not quite all there is played by Chris Leach. The lovely Laura O'Donoughue (please don't get a nose job) is the sister who cares for her brother a little too much.

The ghost movie is deeper than most ghost stories, but it is far from a horror film. The special effects were minor when they were used. I enjoyed the film, but the ending was too anti-climatic. 3 1/2 stars

F-bomb, sex, incest theme, nudity (Amie Morris)",1341619200,9,934,4.514792899408284
5109375,4,B007RVUDP2,"What could be more horrific than coming home to find your family murdered? But that's just the beginning of the psycho thriller about a man who seeks a solution after his life is forever altered in the most hideous way. As he unravels the mystery, he finds out the answers may be just as frightening as the murder itself.",1339113600,2,321,4.4576271186440675
5109376,4,B007RVUDP2,"This is a classy little ghost-story, set in rural England, nicely photographed, with nifty production values beyond its modest budget.  Every trick in the book is used to give a scare or two, and they all still work!  It's the kind of story where the ghosts actually talk and interact with the living, and the effect is nicely accomplished.  Despite the title and box, this isn't a gore-fest, but more of a psychological thriller concerning a middle-aged man who's returned to find his wife and children murdered--by a ghost, he believes.  He recruits a young man with certain powers to return to the old farmhouse in hopes of getting the spirits to move on and maybe finding out what happened to his family.  At best, the film reminded me of the original Exorcist and the relationship between the older and younger priests.  In this one, the horror of his family-members' deaths is just the beginning of the dad's nightmare.  The movie sports sharp, thoughtful writing and direction--it's not a handheld quickie.  Hopefully we'll see more from writer David Ross and director Matthew Lawrence in the future.",1338940800,7,1107,4.913978494623656
8521540,3,B007RVUDP2,"I think this movie suffers more from bad marketing than anything else.  The cover art, the title and the byline don't fit.  This is more of a family drama with some supernatural elements than a true horror.  There's nothing ""bone chilling"" about it.

George Morris hires a medium to exorcise a ghost from his family home.  He left the family after a big fight, and came back to find his wife and two children dead.  He is angry and insistent that Robert Brandon (the medium) get right into the business of summoning up the spirit so that he won't have to pay too much for the service.

Robert has a genuine talent for talking to the  dead, but is tangled up with a business partner who thinks that all they need to make money is the flashy parlor tricks.  Seeing an opportunity to do some real work, Robert agrees to help George.

The relationship between George and Robert is interesting and amusing.  George is a bit of a lowbrow, who settles most of his problems with his fists.  While Robert is investigating what happened to the family, George keeps interrupting and trying to tell Robert how he wants the job done.

One by one, Robert summons and speaks to George's dead family, trying to sort the truth from the half-truths and misdirections as each spirit relates the story in a way that shows them in the best light, and shows themselves as the true victim of tragedy of their deaths.

As Robert begins to tease the real story out, it makes George increasingly uncomfortable, irascible and menacing.

The entire story is told from one room in the now abandoned house, with flashbacks set in and around the house.  It's more of a teleplay than a professionally-produced feature film.

Overall, it doesn't set a high bar of expectations -- but what it does promise (minus the over-the-top absurdity of the cover art), it delivers.

The characters are true-to-life and human, and each of them takes a path through the story that leaves them different from how they're found at the beginning.  These story arcs are interesting, if pedestrian.

The acting and direction feels authentic and competent for a story like this. I particularly enjoyed Kenneth Hodgson as George Morris.  He could have come from BBC central casting for a six- or ten-episode role on a show like East Enders.  I'm also adding Laura Donoghue to my list of actors I'd like to see more of.",1530230400,,2365,4.661835748792271
8521541,4,B007RVUDP2,"Not for the blood and gore seekers.
I liked it. Not really a horror story as such, but there was horror in play both before and after the murders. Funny thing, while watching this presentation, I kept thinking that would be interesting in summer stock. With a small stage for the medium & father and a larger stage for the storytelling.",1508112000,,336,4.524590163934426

8521544,1,B007RVUDP2,I purchased this movie because of  some of the positive reviews. Bad mistake as this movie was about as thrilling or scary as a  Mickey Mouse cartoon.  Don't let the cover art fool you-as it did me. I think most of the POSITIVE  reviews were written by the filmmakers  and or the people who were in this piece of nonsense. Complete waste of money and time.  Don't make the same mistake that I did.,1399939200,,397,4.297297297297297

8521547,4,B007RVUDP2,SO creepy!  The plot just keeps unfolding and unfolding and getting more and more creepy until the end where I'll just say I'm sleeping with the light on tonight.
