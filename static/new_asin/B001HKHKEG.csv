3630464,4,B001HKHKEG,"I am a big racing fan and so seeing footage of the Kentucky Derby with Citation winning, Whirlaway, Count Fleet, Swaps with Nashua, Seattle Slew, Native Dancer lose his only race - these were great to see and collect.  But I do wish that more of the footage from the 1950's and 1960's would become available.  I know that film was hard to protect over the years but isn't there more out there?

This edition was divided into catagories that flowed very well.  But I wouldn't even need that really.  And I would hope that there would also be a DVD on the Preakness and Belmont.  A collection of the other big races that have a long,glorious tradition the 'Handicap' Triple Crown, The Triple Tiara for 3 year old fillies, Turf racing through the last 100 years or more.

Moonlight Press Video did a very good job and I hope they take on some of the other great Racing Moments",1233446400,23,873,4.41875
3630465,5,B001HKHKEG,"During a time of very few horse racing DVDs, this item is a real gem.  It features wonderful footage of past and present Kentucky Derbies - Triple Crown champions, fan favorites, upsets, etc. Citation, Secretariat, Barbaro, Iron Leige -- they are all here.  The stories behind the races are brief and to-the-point; they don't overshadow the action. If you love Thoroughbred horse racing, this DVD is for you.",1231804800,14,408,4.985294117647059

8308822,5,B001HKHKEG,This is a great book for all Racing Fans .  It recaps some of the best Derby Moments .  A must read .,1384560000,,101,3.347826086956522
8308823,2,B001HKHKEG,"The narration, it became obviously the Narrator knew nothing about horsing racing.  Just reading lines,he ruined the movie for me.",1358899200,,130,5.5
8308824,5,B001HKHKEG,"I purchased this for a special event to honor someone who was moving to another state, but staying with the company.  We had it playing on a wall-sized screen at one side of the room.........people loved it, and he wound up taking the DVD with him.  I should purchase an extra one.  Really a nice DVD.",1356307200,,301,4.339285714285714
8308825,5,B001HKHKEG,Kentucky Derby: Greatest Moments was much appreciated by persons planning to visit Louisville later this spring.  the video was intelligently compartmentalized into categories  easily understood by most persons. It was not just one race after another without some more careful organization.,1333238400,,290,6.048780487804878
8308826,4,B001HKHKEG,"The derby moments was good although, I was expecting a little more about certain horses. They show great footage from all winners( esp. secretariat and citation) but was displeased that they didn't show much of affirmed and how close he was to losing the race! Overall I will watch this film again sometimes.",1329004800,,308,4.830188679245283
8308827,2,B001HKHKEG,What a major disappointment.  I've been following the giddy ups since the sixties and have had the privilege of seeing some of the truly greats run.  The title of this video alone had me on the edge of my seat.  Yet what it delivered was far far short of expectations.  Blah!,1317513600,2,275,4.333333333333333
8308828,5,B001HKHKEG,there is not much I can say after! WOW! I have been involved with thoroughbreds and the racing industry for many years and this dvd drips with history. This is beautifully put together. I recommend this to anyone who is any kind of sports fan and can appreciate the beauty and athleticism of horses and jockeys.,1251936000,8,311,4.571428571428571
8308829,2,B001HKHKEG,"I have quite an extensive collection of thoroughbred horse race DVD's and by far this is my least favorite of all.  If your looking for black and white grainy film clips of races this is for you, otherwise I'd stick to the DVD; First Saturday in May, On The Muscle, or Barbaro a Nations Horse. The best part of this video is the box, since most fans already know the history of racing and who won what. I expected more and would return it if it were not a DVD which is non-returnable. Thank you.
