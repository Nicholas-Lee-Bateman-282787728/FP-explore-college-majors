2770478,5,B000NJWTPM,"I bought this movie a few yrs ago @ blockbuster. Its funny bc it looked really good on the cover, but I did not know that it would blow me away. The actors/actresses' in the movie are the best. They made the character come to life. The movie describes two brothers who were born in New Orleans (N.O.) and raised in the gritty streets, who's family goes through the trials & tribulations of the ghetto. U know drug dealing, killings, etc. However, when one brother falls in love with his childhood sweetheart and decides to change his life around, but the streets keep calling him back. Without giving away the ending...the movie shows the harsh reality of how ppl can be at the top of the world & think that they are ""untouchable"", and in the blink of an eye, the foundation that they stand on can crumble beneath their feet.

All I can say is...""U won't be disappointed & its worth the money spent!"" Invite some friends over and enjoy this movie, bc I guarantee it will blow you away.

2770480,5,B000NJWTPM,"I purchased this movie because I like to support our African-American Film makers who would otherwise would not even get noticed.  I am a film maker myself and I rate this with 5 stars.  At first I thought ""Oh boy not another GHETTO movie about drugs and shoot em up losers in life"".  It took me awhile to get past my own prejudices to watch it thoroughly to the end but I am glad I have. Based on a true story it was well written and the acting wasn't bad.  It has substance and a real plot that at the end you just say ""DAMN"".  that was good.  I recommend it to everyone.",1235433600,,573,4.0265486725663715

8178816,4,B000NJWTPM,"The story centers on Shawn (Michael Anthony Jackson) and his family as they lived in New Orleans prior to Hurricane Katrina. Shawn's dad (Franklyn J. Anderson) was a hitman who died while Shawn was young. Along with Shawn's brother Killer (Andrae Noel) they form a crime family while their mother (Jalene Mack) turns tricks to support her crack habit.

Shawn has a girlfriend also named Katrina (Karen Yelverton) who like the hurricane symbolizes a saving force in his life. A robbery ends up with deadly revenge factor that only the hurricane can save them. The claim made by the film is that there were people who were living lives of despair and crime. They wanted out of the city and in one way Hurricane Katrina was oddly a blessing.

It was an interesting film. It lacked polish. In many ways it was no different than other thug films. The ending, i.e. post Hurricane was all too quick. We get to know little about the transition from thug to a Walmart associate. My question would be, if the film is based on true events, while aren't these killers in prison?

Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word, sex, no nudity. While there is killing and violence, it lacks being graphic.",1386460800,2,1176,4.699029126213592
