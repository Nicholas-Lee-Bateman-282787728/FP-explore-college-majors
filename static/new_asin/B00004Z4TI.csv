1379872,1,B00004Z4TI,Hmmmmm....... I don't know about this movie. Although it was kind of funny. It was the worst movie ever...where did they find these actors? You may get some good laughs from this movie..but if you are looking to be scared. This is not the movie for you.,1037318400,,253,4.404255319148936
1379873,1,B00004Z4TI,"I saw this and I was like ""a cheap horror movie from the same compay that brought us the Puppet Master series, how can I lose"". Well I'll tell you how I lost, it was a horrible movie that I could barely finish. OK the story was horrible, come on a kid accidently gets shot, but luckily he summoned his doll clown before he died, to kill people of course. So to sum it up, even if your a big horror movie buff like I am, you can pass this one up, just not worth watching.",1033689600,3,470,3.90625
1379874,5,B00004Z4TI,Killjoy has to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The actors were extremely ghetto as well as the killer clown. I would have to say the best part was when the clown sold the gangsta's some weed from his clown mobile.,1033344000,,227,4.181818181818182
1379875,1,B00004Z4TI,"I'll second the other reviewers here... but first let me say I have been a Full Moon fan for years... this is not only one of their worst films, but one of the worst films by any large video production company I have seen. Zero redeeming qualities... bad acting, inane script, crap directing, and heck, even bad background music. DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME!",1011052800,12,352,4.603174603174603
1379876,1,B00004Z4TI,"This movie was really [bad], along with most of the other fullmoon movies. With the exception of the puppet master series and the dead hate the living. This is about a clown who is brought to life by a tormented boy. It ride around an his ice cream truck while picking up his victims and sending them to killjoy world. Though it is [junk] you might get a few laughs out of it.",1002067200,,376,4.164383561643835
1379877,5,B00004Z4TI,"Alright.... I love horror movies.... they are the coolest.. now yes.. when I saw this I was not scared at all...But then I figured out that I was looking at this movie the wrong way. Killjoy has to be the best comedy ever written!! It isn't scary but I've seen this movie at least five times... and you can find some of the funniest things in it. So all of you that only gave one chance, please watchi it again, and laugh your head off. Just look at it as a comedy. Killjoy's hair alone is enough to make you pee your pants. So for Killjoy...Watch this movie.",993686400,3,559,4.185185185185185
1379878,3,B00004Z4TI,"Yes, at times this movie doesn't make sense at times, but it's worth a look. Nice to see some Black horror movies being made for once. Plus it was a bonus to see what the guy that voiced Destro and Iceberg in GI JOe and Devastor on the Transformers. If you're wondering who that is it's Arthur Burghardt.",984441600,,304,4.258620689655173
1379879,1,B00004Z4TI,"Let me start by saying that I love horror movies, and I enjoy cheesy ones as well. Full Moon does make some really great trashy movies (The Puppet Master and Subspecies series for example), but this one is just plain trash. In fact, I'm very angry that 90 minutes of my life was wasted on this crap. The plot of the The plot concerns a guy who loves a girl whose boyfriend is a hoodlum. In order to pay the guys back after getting beaten up, the guy invokes Killjoy, some kind of killer clown demon to come take care of his problem. Well, nothing happens, and then the hoodlum and some of his partners kill the guy, and one year later, Killjoy pops up to wreak havoc. I probabaly just made that sound a lot better than it actually is. The movie has no continuity. In the first scene, the guy attempts to ask out the girl, but is then beaten by the hoodlum and his partners. Cut straight to a scene of the guy sitting in a circle surrounding by candles holding a clown doll and ""calling on Killjoy"". I couldn't figure out what was going on, like who or what is Killjoy? In addition, there's an ominous mystical man who looks entirely like a wino and gives no explanation of what Killjoy is and disappears in a flash of light (demonstrating some really bad SFX). This movie seems to get everything wrong. It takes its incredibably stupid plot seriously, the acting is terrible, the script is full of cliches and bad dialogue, not to mention the Killjoy character. After the movie wasted a good half-hour getting to him, any seriousness the movie is going to attempt goes down the drain when he opens his mouth. First of all, Killjoy laughs after everything he says...everything! And it gets really annoying when nothing he says is funny. If you're looking for a good horror movie, this is not it. If you're looking for a bad horror movie to make fun of, this still is not it, and if you're a full moon fan, notice that this an especially ripe turkey. In addition, there's a documentary included that is actually the only fun you might have with this movie. The seriousness of the actors and producers, who treat this movie as if it were CITIZEN KANE are laughable. Beware! The box makes this movie look like some trashy fun, but the only fun you'll have with this movie is hitting the eject button on you're VCR to get rid of it.",976665600,15,2327,4.401392111368909
1379880,4,B00004Z4TI,"This is Full Moon's third entry in its urban series now known as Big City Pictures.  Right off, let me say this is the best of the batch.  This time they chose a 21 year old script writer who knows the street lingo and is up to date on the horror genre.  The Killjoy character is a combination of Jim Carey and Tim Curry and the guy from Sgt. Kabukiman.  Of course he has all the best dialogue.  Beware the profanity is blunt, but isn't that what you expect in urban life. Not much in the way of extras.  There is a twelve minute documentary thrown in with the trailer, but no other promos.  Still, overall a great package.  And if you know Full Moon, you know you will see a Killjoy puppet in stores soon!",975974400,,706,4.139705882352941
1379889,4,B00004Z4TI,"Killjoy is AWESOME. A bad plot, horribly over-done acting and Killjoy himself? A masterpiece of cheesy one liners, an even cheesier laugh and mystical evil powers that seem to increase exponentially as the movie carries onward. I'd highly recommend this if you are looking for a hearty laugh..I about died.",1234742400,2,306,5.14
1379890,5,B00004Z4TI,"Killjoy is a clown! And i have to say he's by far the funniest clown i've ever seen. Me and my Friend Leon (I have to give him a mention as he made me watch this epic) stumbled onto this work of genius by accident and so far we have yet to see an unintentionally funnier horror film, the work is just plain inspired! You may think im exaggerating but please buy it and you'll understand. The story is basically centred around a killer clown summoned up by a ghetto child but to be honest you don't really need to know the story as it's a piece of crap, it's all about the acting and set pieces which are truly awful in a laugh out loud way , it's magic. And to top it all off the disc also comes with a ""making of"" which in itself is hilarious. The director really does believe that he is directing a classic of ""Night of the living dead"" proportions. And the actors all think that it's there big break into ""Hollywood"". Its truly the worst film ever made and for that reason alone it stands as a classic. The word Turkey was born for this. Awesome.. Please buy it...and react and join the Killjoy Fanclub....",1099958400,5,1109,4.211267605633803
1379891,5,B00004Z4TI,"Alright this is one of those movies you can't take too seriously, as a matter of fact i have yet to see a full moon picture you can.  I mean first look at the cover of killjoy, it has potential to be a good movie, then you flip it over and read the back....  you start reading about voodoo and the ghetto....yeah things start to get dumb, not that i have anything against either one.. but those two things just don't mix

The first 10 minutes of the movie you get the idea the acting sucks and the lines/plot are extremely funny and so fake which makes it a bad horror movie... but a 5 star comedy!  If your into the spoof movies like army of darkness and stuff like that then killjoy should be your cup of tea

so call up some ur buds pop it in kick back relax and let the good times roll",1098316800,,789,4.0
1379892,1,B00004Z4TI,"No, this film will not under any circumstances be nominated for an Oscar.  It is incredibly low-budget, as if it is a senior class project for a TV productions class.  But it's entertaining.  You can pick out all of the horrible acting moments, or the non-existant special effects, cliches, etc.

My boyfriend works at Blockbuster so I didn't have to pay to see this, which is good.  But I'm still glad I saw it.  It's always nice to see how some people actually have pride in the horrible job they do.

Do not buy this movie unless you are like, Oprah Winfrey rich. Get something better.  Something that actually had a snowball's chance in hell of being released in the movie theaters.  Just take everyone's word for it--it's not good.  But, if you like to point and laugh at people who are doing stupid things, you'll be entertained by it.",1097193600,2,841,4.546666666666667

1379894,1,B00004Z4TI,"I saw this DVD cheap in a shop and was expecting to take home a modern day 'IT', made in the year 2000- relatively new. However, I should not have wasted my money. It is a low budget film, with a script written by a high-school student who obviously has NO talent. The costumes and storyline are awful and there isn't a scary bit in the entire film. Music is cheaply made by those that produced the film and even if it isn't supposed to be taken seriously- it's definately not funny! It is described as an 'ethnic' film in the making of it, meaning you feel as though its exclusive to black people with the jokes and dialect. I cannot believe they made a sequel!!!!!!",1051574400,4,667,4.301587301587301

Sure the movie is cheap, the story doesn't really make sense, and the movie has almost zero scares. But if you take this movie as a comedy, it is a fun time! The clown had me in stitches pretty much every time he was onscreen, and the gang also made me laugh with their ghetto dialogue.",1399852800,,446,4.451219512195122

A bunch of adults discover just how frightening the wrong kind of clown can be in this horror opus. After the girl he loves is stolen away by a thuggish gang member, a young man uses the forces of evil to bring to life Killjoy (Angel Vargas), a clown doll he owned as a child. The young man is killed before the spell can fully take effect, but Killjoy soon comes to life to wreak a horrible revenge on the people who killed his master.

Review - 2/5
When I seen how low IMDB had Killjoy rated I just had to watch it. Was it really that terrible? Well I've seen much, much worse. Yeah the characters are bad and the whole cast is virtually unknown. The camera work is amateurish and cheap. But it does have it's moments that made me laugh at times. The evil clown seems like Micheal Jackson dressed up in a costume. He has some funny one liners and would have been scarier if not for the corny script. The effects aren't the greatest but for how cheaply it was made for they do ok. This film pretty much destroyed the chance of any of the actors or director ever becoming a big name. None of them has made anything of note since. Some of them haven't even acted since. Sorry but this clown in the hood type film just didn't work. It's funny for a one time watch but that's about it. I am relectant to watch the other Killjoy films but I'm sure it can't get any worse. Oh yeah, some hot black girls show some skin at least ;).",1396742400,,1448,4.153024911032029

7928025,3,B00004Z4TI,"Let me just start off by saying that this is not a pure horror movie. This is more along the lines of a comedy horror movie. C'mon, anytime there's a clown involved in a horror movie, you know there's bound to be comedy. Anyways, Killjoy is a ""horror"" movie that takes place in the 90s ghetto of an urban area and is about a social outcast high school kid named Michael, who is the target of a group of gangsters: Lorenzo, T-Bone, and Baby Boy. Michael has a crush on Lorenzo's girlfriend, Jada, and at the beginning of the film is seen trying to get close to her, but leads to the arrival of the gangsters who lay a beating out on Michael. Tired of consistently being attacked by the 3, Michael gets involved with Black Magic to try and summon a demon to possess his only friend, a Killjoy doll and help him teach the 3 thugs a lesson. However, before Michael can finish the process; he is abducted by the gang and brought into an abandoned area of the woods, Michael is accidentally shot and killed by Lorenzo when they were supposedly joking around with him.

 Skip to a year later as the remaining cast must come face to face with Killjoy, a demonic killer clown with an ice cream truck transporter. Acting in this movie was a little overplayed and the effects in this movie were so cheap and beyond low budget, it's almost as if a high school Mass Communications class made the film. Don't believe me? Watch the trailer and you'll see for yourself. Throughout the film we see an angel in the form of a homeless old man, warning Jada of Killjoy and how to defeat him. In the end, all I have to say is, skip on this movie and watch the others that follow. Acting is a bit better and the effects are much more acceptable and don't look like a 9th grader just began learning how to use effects. The only funny thing about this movie is maybe the clown's laugh. That's it. Other than that, you're not missing anything. Save your money and check out the other 3 Killjoy films",1358640000,,1974,4.332432432432433
7928026,2,B00004Z4TI,"This is a low budget African-American horror film that develops into a better franchise. Michael (Jamal Grimes) has a crush on Jada (Vera Yell), who in turn is the girlfriend of bad boy Lorenzo (William L. Johnson).  Lorenzo and his gang are bullies and thugs. Michael attempts to use black magic to conjure up something called ""Killjoy"" which we know nothing about, or him as there is no character introduction.

Things don't go well for Michael and we jump to a year later where the remaining cast must combat Killjoy, a magical killer clown with an ice cream truck transporter. The acting and lines were fairly bad. There is a magical homeless guy that really isn't explained. The clown was rather repulsive, and that was by design...I think.

7928027,1,B00004Z4TI,"Killjoy is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.  There aren't a lot of horror films out there featuring an African-American cast, but there's one more than there should be.  It absolutely floored me to find out that this film actually inspired two sequels.  I can forgive one horrible movie, but three Killjoys really should be a crime.  Truly, there is not one positive thing I can say about this movie; heck, I can't even give thanks that the film is so short because, even at 72 minutes, it goes on and on much longer than it should have.  The acting is horrible, the dialogue is horrible, the film's herky-jerky pace is horrible, the special effects are embarrassingly horrible, and the story itself is utterly hopeless.

Boy loves girl; boy gets beaten up and murdered by girl's gangsta boyfriend; ridiculous clown with a magical ice cream truck seeks revenge on everyone involved.  Apart from the absurd ending, that's pretty much the whole movie in a nutshell.  For some reason, it took our victim's black magic ritual a year to actually work, and Killjoy the killer crown isn't exactly interested in justice when he does show up.  It's a good thing there's a homeless man knowledgeable in the ways of this whole business that shows up with some advice on putting an end to the clownish carnage.

As painful as it is watching this film's gangstas trying to sound like gangstas, it's Killjoy's dialogue that will have your ears bleeding.  It's one incredibly unfunny one-liner after another with this guy, but he's the only one laughing - maniacally - every single time he says anything.  The special effects, on the other hand, are laughable, including what has to be the worst CGI beheading I've ever seen.  I can only hope that someday in the distant future I will be able to block the bad memories of this awful film from my mind.  Take my advice and stay as far away from this film as you possibly can.",1331424000,2,1947,4.622093023255814
