8438548,5,B004QTO3X6,"""Garo"" was aired from October 7, 2005 to March 31, 2006, and served as a major deviation from standard tokusatsu (Japanese fantasy based super-hero series and movies, such as Ultraman), being marketed towards older teens and adults. Many episodes featured graphic violence and mature themes, items that were always kept out other entries into the genre which were strictly children's entertainment.  So here is the review:
Each and every chapter starts with this great phrase:
""Where there is light, shadows lurk and fear reigns... yet by the blade of Knights, mankind was given hope...""

GARO focuses on the life of Kouga Saejima, who assumed the title of Makai Knight to protect humanity against dark demonic manifestations called ""Horrors."" In his quest to purge them, he encounters a young girl named Kaoru whom he saved from a Horror, but was stained with its demonic blood. As a rule, those that been stained by the blood of a Horror shall be cut down, or else they will die painfully in approximately 100 days. Kouga had mercy upon her and tries to find a way to purify her before her remaining time expires. Thus, the series focuses on Kouga's developing relationship with Kaoru and his stand in protecting humanity after the wishes of his father, who was his predecessor with the title of GARO.
The series was created and chief directed by Keita Amemiya (Kamen Rider ZO, Zeiram). It is directed by Makoto Yokoyama (Power Rangers) and Kengo Kaji (Uzumaki). Overall this a great not to miss series.",1299369600,,1505,4.898039215686275
