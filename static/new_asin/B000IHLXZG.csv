8145375,4,B000IHLXZG,"""Petit Con"" is an engaging little film about a naive, idealistic, frustrated, mean-spirited 18-year-old who's difficult transition to maturity creates havoc within his family. Good performances and an insightful look at youth make this a very watchable, entertaining, and amusing film. Plus, the film score, while used sparingly, is quite good. The ending left me wanting more.",1373673600,,377,5.631578947368421
