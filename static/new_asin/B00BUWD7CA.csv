8574291,4,B00BUWD7CA,"Mill Creek has given us quite a deal with their 4 movie packs, and this one is no different. They've given us a directors cut of ""In The Cut"", and anamorphic widescreen presentations with Dolby Digital sound. The Best thing you can say about Mill Creek Entertainment is that the quality and variety keeps going up while the prices stay the same. Here's the descriptions of the four films included.

In The Cut

This sensual thriller features Meg Ryan (You've Got Mail) and Mark Ruffalo (The Avengers) in unforgettable performances as they search for a killer who knows their every move, and knows they're getting too close for comfort. In the underbelly of lower Manhattan, Frannie Avery (Ryan), a reserved English professor, becomes obsessed after seeing more than she should of an impassioned couple. After the young woman turns up dead, Frannie is questioned by a homicide detective (Ruffalo) who draws her into a liberating but disturbing erotic encounter. As the body count rises, familiar suspects begin to emerge. Unrated Directors Cut/1.85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen/Dolby Digital 5.1

The Quiet

This erotic and suspenseful tale of sex, lies and betrayal stars Elisha Cuthbert (The Girl Next Door) as Nina Deer, a pretty cheerleader whose life is turned upside-down by the arrival of her parents' godchild Dot (Camilla Belle, 10,000 BC), a deaf and mute girl recently orphaned by her father's death. Although Nina looks upon Dot's deafness with disdain, her family and friends develop a strange attraction to her, and Dot soon becomes a sounding boarding board for everyone's heaviest burdens. But when Nina becomes convinced that Dot is hiding a few secrets of her own, she decides to confess a family secret so disturbing, it cannot be ignored. 2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen/Dolby Digital 5.1

Shadow of Doubt

When the daughter of a billionaire is murdered in a rough sex romp gone bad, District Attorney Jack Campioni (Tom Berenger, Inception) is quick to indict an up-and-coming rap artist. Fresh off the acquittal of Councilman Steven Mayer (John Ritter, Bad Santa), high-profile defense attorney Kitt Devereaux (Melanie Griffith, Working Girl) comes to the aid of the young rapper. Teaming with investigator Al Gordon (Huey Lewis, Duets), Devereaux finds herself up against unexpected dangerous forces, including one of the city's most politically ambitious families. Blindsided at every turn, Devereaux offers herself up as bait - and in the end, discovers that behind every conspiracy theory lies a grain of truth. 1.85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen/Dolby Digital

Trapped

From the producer of Thelma & Louise comes a white knuckle, edge of your seat thriller starring Charlize Theron (Snow White and the Huntsman), Courtney Love (The People vs. Larry Flint), Stuart Townshend (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) and Kevin Bacon (X-Men: First Class). When their daughter is taken for ransom by a gang of serial kidnappers, a young doctor and his wife find themselves held hostage while a 24 hour plan to extort their money is set into motion. With time running out and the health of their asthmatic daughter at serious risk, they find themselves in a race against the clock as the ""perfect crime"" begins spiraling towards an unthinkable, terrifying and deadly conclusion. 1.85:1 Anamorphic Widescreen/Dolby Digital 5.1

Now, while ""Steamy Erotic Thrillers"" aren't usually my type of films, each of these sport a top notch cast and fantastic print quality at a budget price. Mill Creek won me over as far as giving these movies a try. You should too.",1378080000,,3562,5.191637630662021
