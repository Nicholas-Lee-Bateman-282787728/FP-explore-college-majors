8290165,5,B001CW89Z8,"This one nails most of the work that is done in the Open Hearth. Some of the gear used is a little different than what We used to use is a little different. If this video was in color that would be able to show some of the tasks better. Trying to tell someone what is like on the charging floor, or tapping a furnace cannot be done. It was one of the toughest jobs ever I have had the pleasure of doing ! HA HA
I bought back a lot of memories. Enjoy !",1401580800,,451,3.7578947368421054
