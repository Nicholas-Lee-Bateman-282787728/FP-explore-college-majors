8077439,4,B000AARK5I,"As the daughter of a WWII vet stationed in the Pentagon during most of the War, I have heard about many of these battles. Many were part of America's finest days!",1397779200,,162,4.258064516129032
8077440,3,B000AARK5I,"This DVD set has some very fuzzy, speckled and extremely high-contrast and bleached-out footage, but much of it is good. Approximately 75 percent of the footage was new to me and I own: The World at War, the Battlefield Series, The Unknown War: WWII and Epic Battles of the Eastern Front, and Victory at Sea. The narrator talks too fast for my liking, but I got used to him. I wouldn't pay more than $10.00 for this set. Fortunately I was able to purchase mine used in nearly-new condition for .99 plus $3.99 shipping, and I'm glad I did! Overall, I believe any WWII buff will enjoy this.",1379030400,2,588,4.453703703703703
8077441,4,B000AARK5I,"This is a good set of 5 discs on WW II, if you are a WW II buff
I reccommend it.  The narrator tells the story but you will
find some footage that does not go along with the event he is
telling about.  Hellcats and P-40s at the battle of Midway, no way.
Don't get me wrong, this is a good set and overlook some of
these errors, they are not numerous.  No color, all in black
and white taken at the time it all happened.  A good series but
other better series can be purchased.  If you get it for $10 it
 is worth it.",1347408000,,516,3.7757009345794392
8077442,5,B000AARK5I,"This set of five DVD's, containing twelve 48 minute episodes, is a must for WWII buffs. Back in the early '90s, A&E featured these documentaries in a series called ""The War Years"", hosted by Edward Herrmann. The documentaries were so good that I have been patiently waiting for them to appear on DVD, and now they are here!

Produced in Europe about 25 years after the war, these films compliment and complete such excellent WWII documentaries as the ""The World at War"", ""Victory at Sea"", and ""The Unknown War"". Primarily because 75% of the films in the set are rarely seen, extended B&W footage not contained in the above mentioned documentaries. Also included are exclusive interviews of famous WWII personalities such as Otto Skorzeny, Adolf Galland, Albert Speer, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, US General Mark Clark, to name a few. The quality of the audio and video varies at times, but for the most part I was satisfied and I'm fussy.

Again, this DVD set is highly recommended for any true historian for its rare content and extended footage. Not to mention, it can be had at a bargain price!",1321660800,5,1103,4.8
