8467366,4,B005DRC1K2,"This is an extremely interesting, well-acted film which has long been unavailable in any home entertainment addition.  Unfortunately this DVD is a letterboxed, non-anamorphic edition of the widescreen film, so it offers the lowest of low-resolution transfers.  All about the rather corrupt nature of British politics in the 1960s, it is surprisingly relevant today, on both sides of the Atlantic.  It would be nice to see a better DVD or Blu Ray copy.",1524614400,,451,5.1506849315068495
