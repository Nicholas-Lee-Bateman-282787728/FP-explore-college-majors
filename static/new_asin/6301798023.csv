The plot centered upon the risks that men would take to cheat on their wives.  The underlying message was that, however elaborate, no plan would work because wives know everything.  Another message was that what you have at home already is better than what's 'out there'.  They make this point emphatically from the 1st scene, with Inger Stevens as the 'dream wife' of all time...

Walter Matthau, Paul Manning, plays Inga Stevens (Ruth Who?) husband in this 60s moral style comedy with Robert Moss as Ed, Pauls lawyer friend and confidant.  Paul is a happily married man persistently influenced by his pal Ed in cheating on his wife.  There are many iconic advertisements in the film such as: United Air Lines, Hertz, Dodge products, A&W Drive-Ins, and the Princess phone.

The film is directed by Gene Kelly and attains a higher level with a top cast of the 60s greatest comics in various vignettes.

355849,5,6301798023,"If you're a Madmen fanatic, this may be perfect for you.

Gene Kelly (!) directs a totally amusing, sometimes very funny, and always mind-boggling slice of the mid-60's middle class male sensibility following the invention of The Pill.  Plenty of male chauvinism and dumb blondes and martinis, so if anyone who wasn't alive then wants a little reality on pre-feminist sex and marriage, this may suffice.

This subject matter, script, and peek-a-boo jiggle were risque for the 1967 neighborhood movie screen.  Released before the MPA ratings system was codified, I imagine no one under the age of 18 would have been admitted to see it in theatres.

If you are very sensitive about infidelity, this may not be for you.  ONE LINE SPOILER: But it does have an upbeat ending in favor of fidelity, and it doesn't hurt that Matthau's preposterously long-suffering spouse is GORGEOUS Inger Stevens... you just KNOW he'll come to realize what a nice deal he's already got.

Huge bonus to ogle (in gorgeous technicolor) all the women's fashions & hairstyles, flashy American cars, decor, etc, of that era.  Pretty much without showing any miniskirts (that 40 million teenagers were starting to wear), this is not a hip young movie.  This movie was for married squares for the most part.

Great vignettes by comedic actors of the day (Lucille Ball, Sid Caesar, e.g.) and the best ones are with Rob Reiner, Art Carney, Joey Bishop, Jayne Mansfield, Jack Benny.  In co-starring roles, Robert Morse and Walter Matthau manage to share the screen without one overshadowing the other.

One oddity: There are two reels of this film that are a bit out of focus, so perhaps there were technical problems with the existing print used to create the DVD.  Fortunately, they are not at pivotal moments visually.",1368921600,2,1787,4.936454849498328

It is absolutely perfect comedic timing! Perfect cast! Silly little subplots!

Walter Matthau's adorable naive performance as a rookie in the cheating lifestyle is complemented by cameos from some of the best-known stars of the time. My favorite was a couple played by Lucille Ball and Art Carney.

This movie made me smile from beginning to end. It was more clever than laugh-out-loud funny like the Sunshine Boys.

One caveat: the movie, made in 1967, is very dated. All women in the movie are portrayed as va-va voom sex objects, obedient faithful wives or occasionally as vindictive and money grabbing opportunists. As a feminist I was able to overlook this and enjoy the film.

Morse delivers one anecdote after another to illustrate his rules and the results are hilarious as the philandering husbands slip up. As the movie progresses you get the feeling that the philandering is more of a game to the men than anything else: it's a challenge. The women are gorgeous and the husbands love them and one might wonder why the husbands would want to mess around and this is explained at the very beginning and one of the reasons is when you have a delicious T-Bone steak every day, you crave fish or chicken every once in a while.

If the movie was made today by one of the countless Hollywood perverts, you can bet that their vulgarity would ruin it.",1313625600,,827,4.550335570469799

And at the critical moment, Mr. Mathau's angst (and scruples)gets the better of him in time for the surprise ending.  It's a funny movie.",1286236800,,510,5.035714285714286

Althought the subject matter is how to cheat on your wife, the movie is a light comedy and could be viewed by anyone over the age of 14.

356000,4,6301798023,"While `A Guide for the Married Man' is on almost all accounts morally reprehensible, it is presented in such a witty and appealing manner that one ultimately forgets just how `wrong' this movie really is.

The film follows Paul Manning, a happily married man who can't help but notice his beautiful surroundings; and by surroundings I mean busts and panty lines.  He traps these urges inward and shoves them aside, but then his best friend Edward opens a new line of perspective for him.  Edward is a notorious adulterer, constantly having affairs behind his wife's back, and he justifies this by proposing that a man who doesn't entertain these desires (discreetly, mind you) is doing his wife a disservice, for he will eventually snap and ruin his marriage outright.  He proceeds, through a series of `true life stories' to explain to Paul just how you can cheat and get away with it.

The script is very clever indeed, and it has its moments of pure hilarity.

My main issue with this film is the acting on the part of the two main characters, Paul and Edward.  They just don't seem capable of what they are proposing.  Sure, to keep with the idea that these are average men they should have that debonair suaveness about themselves as some of today's more charismatic stars possess (or even the films director Gene Kelly), but Edward is rather obnoxious and Paul is rather bland, so in my opinion the lack of any real charm makes their position even more unbelievable.

Thankfully the film is littered with these `stories' that star some big names and some better performances (Lucille Ball, Joey Bishop, Phil Silvers and Carl Reiner to name a few).  Inger Stevens and Jackie Russell do fine jobs as the wives of these two philanderers and Sue Ane Langdon is fetching as Paul's neighbor, and object of affection.

Morally the film is rather corrupt, and there are moments when I found myself baffled at the line of reasoning used by Edward, who is a truly disturbing person (to believe that he is being `considerate' of his wife's feelings by covering his tracks to the tee so that she will never find out about his affairs is rather dense) but the film is meant to be taken as a mocking look into the minds of men.  I'm sure every one of us hot-blooded males would love to be able to justify Edward's reasoning, but hopefully we are too mature to ever do so.",1226534400,,2363,4.626794258373206

It is good enough entertainment, but I feel unable to grant the movie any more than four stars - it would have been three stars, except for Mattheu's performance.",1217721600,,446,4.946666666666666

Walter Matthau plays again the type he would later play to the hilt, the novice. Morse takes Matthau under his wing to how to have an affair with mini skits with famous cameos

This black comedy was strong for the 1960's but by todays standards it was be tame and cute

356058,4,6301798023,"I first saw this movie on TV in the mid 60's.  My wife and I laughed and snickered through the whole thing.  Then I saw it again, a few years later, while in VietNam.  That was a real hoot with a bunch of guys watching and reacting.  Some 35 or more years later, I remembered it and just had to have a copy for myself.  The entire movie, about how to cheat on your wife and not get caught, is chock full of cameos by readily recognizable stars acting out little scenarios as Robert Morse explains how to go about things to Walter Matthau.  It's a light no-brainer, full of amusing surprises, for aspiring cheats who will have no clue what happens at the very end!",1167868800,5,663,4.222222222222222
356059,5,6301798023,"In the early 60s, Hollywood produced a series of sex comedies, including the Doris Day/Rock Hudson films, but this film, along with How to Murder Your Wife, is the penultimate expression of that aesthetic (The Odd Couple sort of closes the genre). Gene Kelly deserves more credit as a director for this brilliant film, which is closer to Restoration Comedy than Hollywood. Brilliantly acted, full of genuinely funny comic routines (in the age of the unfunny SNL skit, people may have forgotten that comedy is supposed to be funny, not painful). I can't recommend this film enough. A genuine gem of a comedy.",1156636800,2,607,4.902912621359223
356060,4,6301798023,"This classic Sixties sex farce has a decidedly schizophrenic attitude towards its subject matter: marital infidelity.  On the one hand it gives the would be adulterer some excellent if joked up advice; on the other hand it clearly portrays said adulterers and would be adulterers in the cast as fools.  Perhaps that is the secret of its success -- the tension between these conflicting viewpoints.  When screenwriter Frank Tarloff first pitched his story idea to 20th Century-Fox, the focus of ridicule was on the cuckolded wives rather than the philandering husbands.  Both the studio and proposed director Gene Kelly were concerned enough about this to push back and get Tarloff to acquiesce in changing the emphasis: ""While the cameo sequences still detailed a long list of ways to avoid getting caught having an affair, the connecting storyline now amounted to something of a morality tale.""  Note: ""Although the film credits indicate Tarloff's screenplay is based on his own book by the same name, the book was actually an afterthought of the studio publicity department; it was published in 1967, shortly before the film's release.""

After a brief animated opening sequence illustrating a number of pro-adultery quotations, the movie opens with stunningly gorgeous Ruth Manning (Inger Stevens) doing calisthenics to maintain her fantastic body while being completely ignored by her book-reading schnook of a husband Paul Manning (Walter Matthau) who turns down her offer to have sex in order to finish his chapter.  Thus in the first few minutes even the men in the audience are thinking what a fool he is.  Nothing that happens later in the movie challenges this first impression; Ruth Manning appears to be the perfect wife.  Similarly Ed Stander (a devilish Robert Morse) is also married to a nearly perfect wife, Harriet Stander (Claire Kelly); in fact one cannot help but notice that ALL of the adulterers and would be adulterers in Paul's and Ed's circle of friends are less than gorgeous men married to absolutely gorgeous wives.

The Turtles' rousing theme song accompanies the title sequence's comical display of Paul's almost crippling but so far not slaked lust for other women, a lust so obvious that his friend Ed, an experienced adulterer, offers to take him under his wing in order to prevent him from getting caught, the sort of ""consideration"" that would prove how much he loves his wife.  What makes the movie the classic it is, is how Ed emphasizes his lessons with anecdotes acted out by several of the finest comic actors and actresses of the time: Joey Bishop, Carl Reiner, Sid Caesar, Art Carney, Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, Terry-Thomas, Phil Silvers, Wally Cox, etc.  These are universally hysterical and downright instructional; they are also the parts of the movie that viewers tend to remember most fondly.  Under Ed's coaching Paul finally gets ready to take the plunge, but before any viewer wishes to put these quite practical lessons into practice, he should watch the swicheroo of an ending.  They don't make them like this anymore, and they probably shouldn't try.

Note: this bare bones DVD contains no extras beyond the trailer.  Both widescreen and fullscreen versions are available on opposite sides of the double-sided disk; the widescreen version, which is the preferred version because some of the jokes are messed up by the snipping, is on the LABEL side.",1147046400,8,3401,5.068100358422939
356061,5,6301798023,"Directed by the dancemaster himself, Gene Kelly takes a hilarious look at the art of deception: Infidelity!

Without being vulgar or mean-spirited, the story revolves around a restless husband (played splendidly by Matthau) being taught the finer points on how to cheat by a zen master of infidelity: a leering Robert Morse, whose approach to the subject combines the brilliance and cunning of a 5-star general with the stealth of a ninja. Morse freely dispenses words of wisdom to the eager Matthau, who gapes incredulously at his mentor's sage advice. The irony here is that while Matthau is ogling gorgeous women throughout the movie, he is married to a drop-dead beautiful wife of his own, the lovely Inger Stevens.

One of the highlights of the movie is that when Morse makes a point we get to see it acted out by an all-star cast of legendary performers. In fact the list of actors is a who's-who of comedic legends. My favorite scene is the one with Joey Bishop (what woman?).

Given the politically correct nature of our times and the overtly sexist nature of the movie, with it's closepups of jiggling breasts, swishing derrieres, and curvaceous legs, I doubt this film could be made in the new millennium, especially with it's women-as-subservient-to-men connotations.

356062,4,6301798023,"Not the laugh riot I remembered but still some classic bits, especially the Joey Bishop ""deny, deny, deny"" scene. Stylistically, it captures the 'swingin' sixties' look and feel which helps the sexist (let's face it) humor hold up today.",1140998400,3,237,5.102564102564102
356063,4,6301798023,"This is a very 60's style comedy. It purports to be risqu, and I suppose it was by the standards of that day, but it is rather tame by today's standards. Much of it is dated but that did not stop it from being a fairly enjoyable romp.

Walter Matthau and Robert Morse are the stars of the show. They play well of men who are friends and office in the same building. Both are reportedly happily married men. What differentiates them is that Matthau's character is a faithful husband while Morse is a philanderer. Matthau's faithfulness, however, does not keep his eyes from wandering and enjoying the bounties of feminine architecture. Morse, advises him that it is his duty to cheat on his wife, if he loves her, so that he does not completely lose it in public one day and embarrass everyone. He offers to train him up in the tactics and strategies to successfully hoodwink the wife and is taken up on his offer.

Although Matthau and Morse are the stars, the film is filled with cameo appearances by other big names of the time. These appearances advance the story by presenting various vignettes describes successes and failures of infidelity. These are usually the source of the humor in this film. They are well thought out, often, convoluted or contrived and usually very funny. Jack Benny's penny pinching methods to dump a mistress play particularly well to his public persona.

While all the immorality is going on, the film has a surprise ending just as the big goal is a bout to be achieved. It's a fun film but not particularly memorable.",1133481600,6,1550,4.629090909090909

I have to agree with reviewer manuel hernandez--they absolutely DON'T make movies like this anymore because they CAN'T: There simply is no modern equivalent for the legendary likes of Jack Benny, Phil Silvers, Art Carney, Lucy Ball, Carl Reiner, Sid Caesar, Louis Nye, Terry-Thomas or, for that matter, stars Walter Matthau and Robert Morse. (Witness the inept results of the ill-considered attempt to remake Stanley Kramer's 1963 masterpiece ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World""...)

After having heard about it for years, I finally saw ""Guide"" for the very first time on a cable movie channel in 1993 and enjoyed it from the zingy start to the satirically sentimental finish. (Any ideas on where I can find the snappy title theme by the The Turtles?)

Walter Matthau is a treat in an uncharacteristic role as a wide-eyed suburban Everyman being tutored in the whys and wherefores of adultery by smarmy neighbor Robert Morse. (You might want to bookend this movie with the stingingly funny ""corporate"" musical ""How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying,"" also starring the talented Morse and released in the same year as ""Guide."") A special nod, too, to the beautiful (and tragic) Inger Stevens (""The Farmer's Daughter"") as Matthau's sweetly trusting housewife.
