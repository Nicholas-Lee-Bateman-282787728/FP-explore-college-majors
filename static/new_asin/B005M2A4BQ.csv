4833880,3,B005M2A4BQ,"Your typical B movie. All the classic things are there. The Voodoo box is a nice twist though, bringing classic and modern together.",1347148800,,132,4.782608695652174
4833881,3,B005M2A4BQ,"What would you get if Rube Goldberg got together with a practitioner of Voodoo: The Box.  But since that title was already taken, and ruined, Needle it is.  Because goodness knows, Le Vaudou Mort wouldn't have had anyone running for the theater (or in this case, wherever you can purchase DVDs).
The plot is a poor attempt to mix horror with mystery (although it owes a lot to Agatha Christie's mystery, And Then There Were None).  The attempt to find out what was going on is handled so casually it's a wonder they even bothered.  There is absolutely no sense of urgency until the very end.  By that time, it's too late to invest any interest in the proceedings.  Suddenly, after a very lengthy ramble, the villain is unmasked and it's over, leaving one with a lot of unanswered questions (lapses in logic notwithstanding).  As this type of genre goes, the filmmakers played it rather safe; neither spooky enough nor gory enough for the type of audience they must have aimed for and missed.  It's tepid at best, just interesting enough to justify its almost 90 minute length.
Among the actors, the only one who stood out was Travis Fimmel, and I'm not certain whether that was a good thing or not.  His performance was weird to say the least.  I kept thinking, as a photographer for the police, maybe they should have given him a few more surprise drug tests than most.  His behavior was decidedly odd throughout, made even more apparent when doing scenes opposite his brother (Michael Dorman), who came across more mundane than just ordinary.  I will say I was kept fascinated by the prospect of what Travis Fimmel's crazy character would do next, forgetting what the movie was about.  For a supporting character, it's never a good thing to eclipse the movie as a whole.
After it was over, I immediately tossed the DVD into my discard pile, never to watch again (not because it was a bad movie, but because it failed to reach for anything beyond the norm).  It was just okay.",1333324800,,1977,4.6275071633237825
4833882,3,B005M2A4BQ,"It would seem that the well would run dry of ideas for a decent horror film these days. We've had tons of slashers and serial killers, demons and wizards, witches and warlocks and vampires that run from blue faced ghouls to sparkly inspirations for lust. But still once in a while a decent idea comes along that's new and fresh. The only problem is it usually ends up in a so so film like NEEDLE.

Opening with the death of a dirty artifact dealer years ago by some remote instrument, the film moves forward to the present day. Ben Rutherford is a college student with the usual group of friends (which these days means there must be at least one gay couple). The family lawyer shows one day with an item belonging to his late father, an item found in a warehouse, an intricate box with a burned picture inserted in it, ornate metalwork and a crank. With no idea what it is or what it's for, Ben shows it off to his friends that night.

Waking the next morning with a hangover, Ben discovers the box is missing. Having taken a picture of it the night before, he takes that to a teacher who specializes in antiquities to see if she has an idea of what it is. Eventually she lets him know that the French inscribed on it seems to lead her to think it was connected to the Grand Guignol, the graphic horror shows from France around 1800. After talking to someone she knows, it is later discovered this is a machine made to wreak revenge on others and worth nearly $500,000 to the right buyer.

At the same time this is going on, Ben's brother Marcus is attempting to make contact with him once more. Having left behind the family years ago he hopes to reunite but Ben isn't having any of it. To say he carries a grudge is oversimplification. But the two are forced together as Ben's friends begin dying in mysterious ways. Since Marcus is the crime scene photographer he takes an interest in the murders and trying to solve them.

The list of suspects includes nearly everyone seen so far, from various friends (that don't get killed off) to Ben's teacher to even Marcus. When it's finally revealed who the killer is it is actually a bit of a surprise, a nice twist.

But the mystery isn't the main reason fans of horror films watch these days. Hardcore fans are there for the kills and how original they are and they're fairly inventive here. We watch as a gloved hand pours wax and blood into the box, inserts a picture of one of Ben's friends, turns the crank and then extracts a wax figure. The hand then wields damage to the figure which in turn happens to that friend, everything from limbs torn off to eyes skewered.

What makes this film part of the so so crowd is that while well made it doesn't leap from B-movie status to top line feature. The acting ranges from believable to mediocre not helped by a script that does the same. Still it made for a nice evening's entertainment and would be well worth the cost of rental.",1332806400,7,2929,4.384898710865562
4833883,5,B005M2A4BQ,"This Australian import is so preposterous I couldn't help but enjoy it!  The movie opens with a bizarre WTF killing, then fast forwards 10 years to a college campus.  We meet a likeable, if somewhat dorky, young man (well played by Michael Dorman) who inherits a strange box from his deceased father.  His friends are intrigued by the box as is his archaeologist professor (V's delightful Jane Badler).  It's not long before Dorman's friends are meeting strange gruesome ends.  Enter Travis Fimmel as Dorman's estranged brother who happens to be a crime scene photographer working the murders.  Together they try to discover the killer's identity.
Of course, the box figures prominently in the whole mess.
NEEDLE has some imaginative death scenes and I didn't spot the killer.  Sure it's contrived and leaves a lot of unanswered questions, but at least it's not a remake, reboot or a found footage travesty.  I had fun watching it and that's what moviemaking is all about.",1325548800,11,972,4.95679012345679
4833884,1,B005M2A4BQ,"Here, for the umpteenth time, is the lost/stolen relic that gives evil powers to it's possessor. In this case we put a photo of a person into a box then put the obligatory activating/donation blood into a receptacle along with some wax and lo and behold a little wax voodoo doll slides out on a tray to which you can mutilate to your heart's desire resulting in the same effect upon the person in the photo.
Yes, the person doing the nasty deed is the one least expected (it wouldn't be a jealous/vengeful female would it?) and yes, a few people die along the way. In an anti-climatic ending - she gets the box turned on her. A little stab on her voodoo surrogate doll and she just keels over.

If you need to see this then you'll probably  FF through the inane script and high school drama class acting to see our poor sacrifices. Total effective viewing time for the four lambs is about four minutes of prosthetic blood.

On the positive side, it was a nice box.",1323216000,2,964,4.374301675977653
4833885,5,B005M2A4BQ,"I caught this last year at Screamfest and I enjoyed it so much I'm gonna buy it. It's very slick looking and looks like a big budget film, but according to IMDB the budget was only $3 mil!!The most unique part of the film has to be the killing machine that (SPOILER) makes these little voodoo dolls...OMG!! i've never seen anything like it before...overall its well acted and has a good story...guessing the killer is fun too! Definitely recommend this, especially if you like Aussie actors like Travis Fimmel and Michael Dorman!",1322611200,2,529,4.760869565217392
4833886,3,B005M2A4BQ,"I haven't found too many horror movies online that I liked, but this one isn't a yawner. It's pretty interesting, and keeps the culprit hidden (successfully) until the last 15 min. of the movie. The bloody scenes are quick flashes of .. well gore .. and you don't get the over the top gratuitous, 3 min. long blood splatters in this movie, so it should be entertaining to most casual horror fans.",1322352000,2,396,4.513888888888889
4833887,5,B005M2A4BQ,"i caught this with my bf at screamfest last year!...we're both fans of films like saw and final destination and this is kinda similar...its not as violent but i think its maybe scarier? got some good jumps at the end!...its slick with some good actors...im now a fan of travis fimel hes hot!!!

that voodoo machine thing is the coolest device i have seen in a long time - i want one!

overall its a scary and a bit gruesome horror and i highly recommend it!!",1315958400,7,458,4.313953488372093
4833888,4,B005M2A4BQ,"The acting was good. The story line kept me interested and I don't really care for ""slasher"" style movies. The ending was actually more surprising than I thought it would be because I thought I had it all figured out, two different times. I decided to buy it as I thought I might watch it again.",1403740800,2,295,4.285714285714286

4833896,4,B005M2A4BQ,"NEEDLE is a nice slab of revenge-horror nastiness w/ a supernatural edge. It concerns a group of college friends who begin dying in godawful (and quite original) ways, after one of them inherits a mysterious wooden box. The survivors must figure out what's happening and how to stop the carnage, if they want to live. Just imagine if SAW's Jigsaw could use black magik, and you'll be pretty close to guessing how this one goes. Extra points for A- The cool-looking box of doom, and B- the way it works. Ghoulish stuff indeed... P.S.- Watch for John Jarratt (WOLF CREEK, ROGUE), as the medical examiner!...",1356825600,2,605,4.771428571428571
4833897,5,B005M2A4BQ,i enjoyed the originality of this film.  it really had me going as to whom the killer was who took the box and why.  I like scary suspenseful movies like this one.  I look forward to watching more good movies on amazon instant video and amazon prime. Thank you for allowing me to rate such a  good film.,1350864000,,303,4.172413793103448

great horror movie",1495152000,,240,3.74
8478996,3,B005M2A4BQ,"A little choppy and a little fast and loose with a realistic story line. Maybe a little more history on the box and how things got set in motion would have helped. Actors were ok, but actors were a little more relaxed considering the killing going on around them and specifically who was getting knicked.

Maybe almost like it was filmed on the first take and actually could've gone over and tightened things up bit. Just didn't feel like some of the actors were taking their roles seriously.

You could probably do better for a horror/thriller",1493424000,,544,4.65625

8479000,2,B005M2A4BQ,"Two stars for an original approach to a slasher flick, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The premise of Le Vaudou Mort (a revenge machine) is great, but there is absolutely no tension and the reveal of the antagonist is completely anticlimactic. There was a much better choice for who the antagonist could have been (someone who was actually affected by a prank pulled by the core group), but the writer opted for something far more random and less effective.",1448064000,,471,4.686746987951807
