These comments and opions will probably only make sense too "" Advanced Professional Industry Editor's. Apologies to the less Specialised among us.
 Warm Regards,

P.S. Hi too Britney Spears, I got your newsletter, See Ya Princess.",1284768000,,438,5.126760563380282
8333146,1,B001PCNZJA,"This was a complete disappointment. I was very excited to watch this because well I love Britney Spears! But not even that love will ever make me watch this pointless video again. It was such a waste of time. The first thing that I hated was that they focused on stupid annoying people to answer the so called interview questions. I thought this was supposed to be about Britney not a whole bunch of morons and their opinion about her. It was all OPINION based, there were a few facts that every true fan already knows. And all the people that talked, they seemed to not even like her that much! They often had bad things to say about her and they would just laugh and say what they thought about her. The most annoying one had to be the guy who used the word ""ironic"" to describe everything that happened to Britney. It was just very poorly made with nasty graphics!!! This DVD is not even approved by the artist or anyone! DO NOT BUY IT PLEASE!! You will just hear the story about Kentwood and what annoying people think of her. Britney is only shown about 6 times for a few seconds saying a few words from past interviews. This is not worth ANY money. It was the most boring thingg. I could not wait until it was over. Please don't buy it, you're only giving your money to a whole bunch of dumb people that seem to not even respect Britney Spears.",1242259200,8,1350,4.298039215686274
8333147,2,B001PCNZJA,"I was very excited for this DVD to arrive in the mail the other night, and I agree with all the other reviewers!  What a disappointment.  I have to be honest... I had a feeling this would be bad!  I knew it wasn't an official Britney video. It was cool to see other people's point of views in bits and pieces, but it got old REAL quick.  At times I was wondering if the people in the DVD were rooting for Britney or against her.  Also, for a DVD that is releasing in May 2009, this only covers Britney's music career up to the ""In the Zone album"". Blackout and Circus are no where to be found on this DVD!  Not worth it.  The title is very deceiving, because this does not talk about her return although it honors it.",1241049600,,717,4.078571428571428
8333148,1,B001PCNZJA,"So I purchased the DVD Britney: For the Record. Once completed Amazon gave me an offer to receive free shipping if my order was over $25. I noticed that this title was recommended. I read the review of the DVD an all the contents sounded very appealing. Britney interviews, performances, etc...anything and everything that a Britney fan would want to see. So my package arrives, I watch the Return of an Angel dvd and what a JOKE!!!! There are maybe two interviews from Britney early in her career, the rest are a bunch of no names that have no credibility. I was very displeased with this DVD. DO NOT BUY!!! I would have rathered pay for the shipping cost of the one DVD instead of purchasing this DVD for the free shipping...a waste of 57 minutes.",1241049600,6,749,4.514705882352941
8333149,1,B001PCNZJA,"Wow - I was SO excited to get this in the mail today! My hubby and I just watched it was I was so mad during it because it was probably the worst attempt of a good Britney DVD ever. It was horrible! All it was, was a stupid documentary of facts about Britney that every real Britney fan already knew about her.

There were times I did not know if I was watching a film about the history of Kentwood, the bashing of Madonna and how she uses Britney for her own fame, or a little bit of Britney's lip syncing bashing. I would not have paid a dollar for this DVD. It was very cheaply made and the people who made it should be embarrased because it will ultimately be an epic fail!!!!!!!

We the fans - wanted to see more BRITNEY behind the scenes and especially about more recent moments in her life - this DVD didn't deliver any of that. So with all of that said, don't buy it - you will regret it - massively!",1240790400,16,908,4.038888888888889
