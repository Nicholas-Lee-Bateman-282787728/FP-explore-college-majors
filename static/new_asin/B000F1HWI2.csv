Over the years, I have purchased many items from Amazon.  This is my first disappointment.

I purchased ""The Exceptional Auto Series - Volume 1"" Vintage, Antique and Classic Automobile Enthusiasts; DVD;  for $59.95.  The video was to include three shows.  I only received Show One: 100 Years of the Automobile with its retail price of $24.95 printed on the video case.  Show Two: Ride of the Century and Show Three: The Orphan Car Video were represented to be included at the $59.95 price, but they weren't.

I am a ""car nut"" and enjoy almost any car video.  The received video was of poor quality.  The video was not much more than an amateur home video.  Toward the video's end, the DVD froze.  Even the printing on top of the video was smudged.

The Amazon delivery and product both come up far short of expectations.  The product certainly was not what Amazon represented in its listing.  Since there was not an easy route to list a private complaint, this review is submitted.",1330128000,,1173,5.403314917127072
