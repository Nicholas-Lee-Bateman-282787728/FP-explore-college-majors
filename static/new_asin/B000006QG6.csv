7904690,5,B000006QG6,"A&E did an informative and excellent job of reviewing the life of Hugh Hefner.  From his childhood in Illinois, to his start of Playboy and moving to California, each stage up to his life (up to 1996) are interesting to  know about.  Mr. Hefner is one of the most influential yet controversial  figures of the last 50 years.  Either hate him or admire him (I personally  admire him) he has defintely changed cultural perspectives about women, sex  and politics.  I think American culture and males in general were given a  gift when Playboy was created.  All thanks to a man with a vision.  My  hat's off to Hef and to A&E for this fascinating biography.",951091200,5,654,4.591304347826087
