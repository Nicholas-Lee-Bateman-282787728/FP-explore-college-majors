2543388,5,B000EXDS4S,"This is a modern version of the classic tale, with Californian kids. There are no really scary moments, at least not for a five year old. The wolf is more of a cartoon character, so the ""violence"" is silly/funny. Kids behave as kids, so the influence of the movie in your child depends on how your Parental Guidance skills are. This movie is A LOT OF FUN. Music is great with catching songs. Your kids will sing it and so will you.",1200268800,4,431,4.2682926829268295
2543389,5,B000EXDS4S,And it's got plenty of kicks for adults that will fly right over the kids heads.  Good perverted fun.  Joey Fatone was brilliant.,1196294400,2,129,4.565217391304348

2543391,4,B000EXDS4S,"This is an updated story of Little Red. When going to Granny's she defiantly goes through a wooded short cut with very entertaining results.  Little Red rides a bike, Grandma lives on the ocean's edge in an A frame with a yoga hut, Dad and Mom are light house keepers.  Lanie Kazan is the Grandmother, she narrarates and sings in the movie, a very talented lady.  The songs are upbeat and quirky and a lot of fun, don't let this one pass you by it is a welcome change from all the brainless kidvids out there.",1184025600,4,509,4.28125
2543392,1,B000EXDS4S,"I was amazed at how many big name movie stars are in this made for DVD musical. The only decent song in the whole show is one borrowed from the 60's/70s rock group Sam the Sham and the Pharohs. If you wish your children watching other children spitting on adults as sport then this is the movie for you. There are other instances that I found disgusting. While this is an updated version of LIttle Red Riding Hood, I would not recommend this for 12 and under. Young teens will find the spitting and other vulgarities humerous, I'm sure.",1170806400,2,536,4.424242424242424
2543393,5,B000EXDS4S,"My almost four year old granddaughter picked this film as she already knew the story of Little Red Riding Hood from her mom and dad.  I was a little concerned it might be too scary as it is PG but I should have realized that she was able to handle it very well.

The wolf is a werewolf.  Lainie Kazan is the grandmother and is reading the story to her grandchildren.  Lainie is wonderful in this!!  If you are over 50 you may remember her singing on the Mike Douglas Show or on Ed Sullivan.

While the wolf swallows people whole, it is done by special effects that make it look cartoonish thus not scaring even my granddaughter!  She really loved the whole film and was very enthusiastically telling her aunt, one of my other daughters, how good it was!!

If you have a mature preschooler who understands pretend and cartoon violence, they will enjoy this as the singing and fun stuff are hilarious.  There is a precarious situation for the two kids in the film but even that is broken by humor and turning out not to be as dangerous as it looks.  Otherwise I would recommend the viewing be by at least 5 or 6 year olds.",1170028800,24,1120,4.315789473684211
2543394,5,B000EXDS4S,"This movie is so entertaining I watch it with my children every time they put it on.  We quote it, and sing along all the time. I rented it and my 4, and 2 year old girls watched it so much i had to buy it.",1169078400,13,206,3.4782608695652173

2543467,3,B000EXDS4S,"Don't waste your money, rent it only.  Some good performances, and Lainie is good, but the story is too childlike. Something out of film school, looks like some of the actors wrote their own lines.",1427068800,,197,4.628571428571429
2543468,5,B000EXDS4S,"This is a strange twist of the Little Red Riding Hood story, but it is great!  What a wonderful musical...my daughter loves it and I like it too!
If you are looking for something different and a musical then this might be it.  It is a little crazy, funny, weird and wonderful story.  The ending is a little scary but it's only a few scenes and the rest is just strangely good.",1424304000,,376,4.194444444444445

It was not, it is actually rated PG. There is poor language and I was offended by the characterization of the ""Three Ashley's,"" otherwise known as the three billy goats gruff.
Do not buy this movie for your classroom!",1402012800,,368,4.125

2543508,5,B000EXDS4S,"I never new that this iconic story even existed in DVD form with Lanie Kazan, Henry Cavill (especially) and it's an excellent way to portray to children the ""pitfalls"" of disobedience of not heeding parent's warnings, without coming across as being 'childish.'",1378252800,2,260,5.214285714285714
2543509,5,B000EXDS4S,This film is a different take on the tale but well done - the cast is superb and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Henry Cavill was cast as Hunter and will continue to make the girls swoon for this blue eyed sensation.,1376006400,,210,4.121951219512195

2543513,1,B000EXDS4S,"Any reviewer who trashes a film or book will always run the risk of being seen as merely a bomb-throwing fanatic whose viewpoints are unworthy of consideration in polite company.  I will run that risk with this film.  It was difficult to tell with accuracy how unimpressed were my 9 year old and 4 year old girls were, but one can get an idea by the fidgeting and apparent disinterest they displayed.  As for me, I would say it was simply awful to the point of being cringe-inducing and unwatchable.  Save your money and time.",1308873600,2,526,4.505263157894737
2543514,5,B000EXDS4S,"""i really liked this. SO SUE ME!"" that's all you can say. it's a little hard to prove this isn't commercial junk. especially since Joey ""the fat one"" Fatone gives such a hammy, Wayne Newtonish, Vegas type, performance as Wolfie Howser.
  despite acting too old for his age, ""the fat one"" is still funny and appealing. and the rest of the cast is fun. Lanie Kazan is good enough to eat as the hippie, liberal grandma of little red. and there is a hilarious turn by three little girls who play a gang called the ""3 Ashleys"" who play like a hybrid of 'Hello kitty' and the 'Avenue 13 Gang'.
  sure the film is a little kooky. what can you say about a production that is warped enough to let Debi Mazar do her own singing? Mazar is a terrific actress but she aint no singer. the result is predictably ear piercing.
  everything about this adorable little musical is a cutie and very ""G"" rated despite a ridiculous ""PG"" (obviously to appeal to older kiddies). the only problem is that Red Riding Hood's love interest is not age appropriate. he's around 17 or 18 and she's 13. an age difference that would make any protective father of a girl cringe.
  this film was directed by Randal Kleiser. one of Hollywood's better directors. when the material is not up to par, Kleiser always comes through. he's just great.

2543516,1,B000EXDS4S,"I purchased this DVD for my 7-year old daughter. It's Little Red Riding Hood, so how could I miss, right? WRONG!!

1. It's a musical - with bad music.
2. It's not for little kids (has a level of creepiness & rudeness).
3. It's just not tolerable on any level - it's that bad.
4. You've been warned.

2543517,3,B000EXDS4S,I ordered this dvd for my niece (4). It was not what I expected. My niece doesn't care for it too much either. I think she might enjoy it more when she's a little older.,1230336000,4,169,3.857142857142857
2543518,5,B000EXDS4S,"I own this movie and have to say, all the poor reviews rather confound me. A reviewer was outraged, saying the movie taught children to disrespect their elders, this is also not true. It is a lesson to children, that they SHOULD listen to their parents because they know best. Red disobeys her mothers urges to stay on the path, and ends up very much worse for wear for doing so.
I saw one that spoke of spitting and vulgarities, the only spitting was present to express how bad a certain set of people were. With all due respect, the people who gave bad reviews to this movie need to get their heads on straight and use logic, not to mention finish the movie before reviewing.",1228348800,,677,4.380952380952381
2543519,4,B000EXDS4S,This was such a cute updated twist to the wonderful old fairy tale.  Lainie Kazan was so perfect for the grandmother role.  Hope to see more modern remakes of the old classics to share with my kids.,1217894400,,198,4.324324324324325
2543520,5,B000EXDS4S,"I wasn't sure what to expect as I came across this collection of remakes from traditional fairy tales and fables. But I have to say kid and adults alike chuckled, laughed and sang along with this very modern and hip version of Little Red Riding Hood.

My son, who is five, wants to watch it over and over again and probably would if we let him.

Buy it!",1212364800,,353,4.176470588235294
2543521,2,B000EXDS4S,"In the real world, a young girl named Claire is preparing to sneak out for the night and meet friends when her babysitting grandmother holds things up by reading a story to her and her little brother. With some mysterious, grandmotherly magic, the pages of Grandma's book are altered to fit the tastes of her young audience. As she reads the story of ""Red Riding Hood,"" we meet a family that parallels their own. Claire imagines herself as Red, a spirited young girl who lives in a lighthouse and is being stalked by a bloodthirsty werewolf as she disobeys her mother and takes a shortcut to her grandmother's house. Red and her kooky, New Age grandmother share the same freedom loving spirit. There's also a fairytale stereotype huntsman whom Red quickly crushes on and is a bit out of place in this otherwise modernized Red Riding Hood tale.

It's painful for me to write a 2 star review for a Red Riding Hood film. I personally adore the story, especially when the werewolf aspect is employed. However, this film, while not without a few good points, is more than a little painful to watch all too often. To go by the DVD cover, you might be expecting something really magical and spectacular, and, at times, the visuals do seem to have that look. A large amount of computer effects are employed, especially with the backgrounds and musical numbers. It works for the background stuff. If only they hadn't gotten so wacky with the musical numbers! Some of the cheesy visuals make the numbers in ""The Worst Witch"" look good. The songs themselves are a mixed bag, but mostly not that great. The cast is all over the place, as is the writing. I suppose one of the biggest stars here is Lainie Kazan as the grandmother, though I also found her to be one of the more annoying aspects of the film. In the ""real-world"" stuff, she comes off as a female Ernest Borgnine from ""Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders,"" and in the story she's just irritating. Surprisingly, the kids are pretty good actors. Sam Oz Stone is pretty decent as Red's little brother (and Claire's too), and Morgan Thompson is probably the best thing about this 2 (or 2 and a half) star movie in the role of Red/Claire. She's got ""the look"" and the voice to really take her places on stage and in the movies, so hopefully we'll be seeing more of her in the future. Joey Fatone is also one of the better aspects of the film, clearly having a ball as the werewolf who probably makes this movie too scary for the audience that will appreciate it the most, 4-year-olds.

On top of all this, the DVD has no extra features beyond English and Spanish subtitles. The film is presented in 1.78:1 widescreen and continues to be way overpriced at the time of this review.",1201651200,8,2722,4.553061224489796
