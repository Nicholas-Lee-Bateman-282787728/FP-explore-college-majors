8739979,4,B017PAYFKI,"A comedy?  No, but it has a lot of comedy in it.  A drama?  No, but there are very dramatic scenes.  It's a fun movie that's worth 90 minutes of your life.

The Throwaways is to hacking what The Expendables is to mercenaries.  James Caan leads this group of misfits with Kevin Dillan as a Jayne-like (Firefly/Serenity) character, a femme fatale Jolie-like ""Swallow"" and a goofy KGB-like agent driver who flees whenever the pot is stirred.

This is a fun was to pass the time.  Filmed in Sofia, Bulgaria.",1503792000,2,503,4.573033707865169

8739982,4,B017PAYFKI,"This is a some what formula comedy-thriller. Drew (Sam Huntington) is a hacker whose arm is twisted by Colonel Holden (James Caan) of the CIA to come work for him. Someone has the Pantheon Key which can access 80% of the world's electronics from a laptop. Drew likes to work alone, he is a bad people person, but is forced to select a team. He uses an algorithm to assemble a team of 3 misfits.

Fisher (Kevin Dillon) goes into rages and likes to do damage and kill.

Dmitri (Christian Hillborg) is a former Russian KGB. He runs when things get tough.

Gloria (Christian Hillborg) is an agent who uses ""special weapons"" to get what she wants.

The film takes place in Sofia, Bulgaria. There is a constant flow of action or comedy. While the film is not over powering great, it is entertaining and I think is better than the 4.6/10 rating at IMDB.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Cat fight.

The title is a bit of a plot spoiler. You don't find out the crew are ""throwaways"" until half way through the film.",1452902400,4,1008,4.39247311827957
