5736460,2,B00CRWDKWY,"Good point made about real life rediculousness. Drawn out hard to watch without moving on to do something, anything else.",1380672000,,121,5.1
5736461,5,B00CRWDKWY,It is a great movie that I only can recommend very much! The movie is a lot of fun and very close to reality in junior soccer regarding parents behaviour.,1380672000,,154,4.166666666666667
5736462,3,B00CRWDKWY,It might have been better if it had Directed by a different Director in my opinion.  Mostly got it for being a Christopher Titus fan.,1380585600,,133,4.32
5736463,5,B00CRWDKWY,"Whether your child plays soccer, trumpet or Juliet, you will be able to relate to this movie.  It depicts the nonsense that surrounds children's activities where adults turn what is intended to be enjoyable and enriching for their children into a nasty competition amongst themselves.  I hope viewers will take the message of the movie to heart and stop trying to make children professionals by age nine.  The writing is sharp and the cast contains wonderful comedic actors.  It is great to see what can be achieved when movies are made in Ridgewood instead of Hollywood.",1380412800,,571,4.916666666666667
5736464,3,B00CRWDKWY,I was excited to hear this come out but I only made through 30 mins of the movie good cast but not a great execution of the movie :(,1378944000,,132,3.586206896551724
5736465,5,B00CRWDKWY,"I loved this cast, they are great in this movie! Cheri Oteri is a spitfire!
Really funny & it's a must see for any parent involved in youth sports.

*It is not suitable for children* (Which makes it even better) :)",1377561600,,214,4.219512195121951
5736466,1,B00CRWDKWY,"Very irrelevant and totally ridiculous exaggerated comparisons to real soccer extremism by youth soccer parents and coaches made this movie painful and laughable (not in a comedic way but laughable by the screenwriter and actors. Seemed as though this was Jeaninne Garafalo's acting debut she was so bad. Not in the least bit funny or relevant for the subject. Made Will Farrell's 'Kicking and Screaming' seem like movie of the decade. Btw. My kid's have had really bad coaches in soccer, so I know the subject.",1376870400,2,511,4.953488372093023
5736467,3,B00CRWDKWY,"Kathy (Janeane Garofalo) moves into a new town where soccer and soccer politics is the norm. She goes from a normal mom to an obsessed soccer mom where all that matters is her eight year old's game, one that she is bored with and doesn't want to play.  The team is coached by Nick (Christopher Titus), an overly repulsive man who makes sure his own daughter gets plenty of playing time.

The film is humorous with its mock MTM opening and had me laughing at certain scenes. The writing failed to capitalize on the situations, many times going stray of the plot and resorting to formula, with scenes being hit and miss. There were some scenes that were best left on the cutting room floor, such as the cyber sex scene that never tied back into the film.

On a side note, in real life Janeane is a devout atheist. In the film she is moved to pray to God for her girl's soccer.

The film had good characters and is worth a rental.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1376611200,3,970,4.337016574585635
5736468,5,B00CRWDKWY,"I was lucky enough to see a preview of this very funny relevant movie sponsored by a local soccer club.  It is a must see for all parents involved in organized sports or any gathering or parents these days.  Its funny, the acting is very real - you may think you know these people and see them in your local coffee store!!

Hopefully those who display this bad behavior will think next time they yell from the sidelines

A MUST SEE!!!!",1374537600,4,435,4.333333333333333
8585465,5,B00CRWDKWY,Bought this movie for my sister the soccer mom. It's insanely funny and a perfect fit for her.,1441843200,,94,4.277777777777778
8585466,1,B00CRWDKWY,About half way through the movie the movie froze and I was unable to watch the rest of the movie. I paid to watch this movie and the movie froze half way through and I didn't get to finish watching it so I am very disappointed.,1437955200,,227,3.9565217391304346
8585467,5,B00CRWDKWY,This movie along with Beer League are two great movies filmed in NJ. Buy it for yourself and for a friend.,1392249600,,106,4.095238095238095
8585468,1,B00CRWDKWY,"I fast forwarded most of the movie and still was pretty crappy.  Its not a regular movie...they talk to the camera a lot....and
nothing...I mean nothing is funny...
only good for soccer parents .....
They should pay us to watch this ....
Guys....keep you sanity ...keep away !",1388275200,,276,4.75
8585469,4,B00CRWDKWY,"Sadly, this movie was marketed wrong, especially its title.  While there are some clever lines, it is not a comedy, but a study of suburban angst and unfulfillment. It is no more a ""family"" film than Ang Lee's superb ""The Ice Storm"", which it brought to mind while I was watching it. If it is looked at from a different vantage point, it is a scathing indictment of suburbia. The title of the play the movie was based on, ""It's All About the Kids"", was much more appropriate since it was an ironic commentary and really all about the parents.",1387756800,,542,4.42
8585470,1,B00CRWDKWY,"The concept was intriguing but the execution was a failure. Terrible acting, weak plot, Kindergarten script.  Skip it!  One of the 10 wors movies I've seen!",1387238400,,156,4.961538461538462
8585471,2,B00CRWDKWY,The movie hits the mark in terms of the nuttiness of youth soccer and soccer parents; it's just not very well made or acted.,1384387200,,124,4.208333333333333
8585472,3,B00CRWDKWY,It's a pretty funny movie worth watching if your have girls that play club soccer.  I think parents can be a lot worse than these parents but a lot of stuff was true and hit home lol.,1383955200,,183,3.945945945945946
8585473,4,B00CRWDKWY,A great and funny Movie for soccer parents. Check it out and you won't be dissapointed. There are a lot of SNL Comedians  in it.,1381881600,,128,4.12
8585474,1,B00CRWDKWY,Thought this would be a funny family movie.  Sooo NOT!  Much too much fowl language and adult insinuations.  I highly do not recommend this movie.  Was not even funny... I couldn't wait too shut it off; we did after about 30min.,1381017600,,228,4.487804878048781
