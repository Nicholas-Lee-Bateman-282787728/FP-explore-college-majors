1885961,3,B00009NHAN,"I am conflicted; the movie was okay when compared to the later trilogy done in the 1990's that rocked! I heard that the early movies, or Showa movies weren't as good as the later ones, and that's true. The movie is good, but the movie has two flashbacks that show Gamera's previous fights from other movies, and it gets boring to see the same thing you have seen before on a movie you haven't. This also ruins the fight outcomes from the other movies if you watch this and haven't seen the other because they show how Gamera beat all of the other monsters. Good plot twist and a surprise at the end of the movie make this not a complete downer. I have to admit, the ending was good when you find out about the aliens and who and what they are. It was also a big surprise to find out who the leader of the aliens really was. They did a good job on that. So overall the movie is good, but it is boring to watch old fights again.",1133913600,2,926,4.093406593406593
1885962,1,B00009NHAN,"Okay, this is a distgusting and sickening film! Aliens invade earth and somehow offspring a octopus creature that was created from the ocean. Supposeldy the aliens reproduced and had the creature. I don't want to know how. Then the monster destroys the rest of Japan, and China. He is almost invinciable. Then Gamera decides to kill the aliens in space. gamera kills them which triggers the monster on earth to die. Gamera goes to earth and he begins to save three kids named Tomo, Sika, and Inoshiro. Gamera almost kills the kids by steping on their house and then he burns woods to ge to another city. Gamera also finds the octopus' offspring and it is exactly the same. Gamera eats it and i beleive by my eyes i saw him pee on its carcas. What the??!!!Gamera even tears his suite and i see the actor. Its horrible! Then about hundreds of alien ships come and Gamera uses one fireball and kills them all. He then dances! What the! He dances and he sings some stupid song and the government sign a treaty with Gamera! What the hell? That is stupid! Then the end! After that i just did an outline in lame terms: ALiens make their offsrping. Japan burns. Gamera kills the monster in Yokohama. Gamera saves the kids almost merely killing them. Gamera pees on the monster's carcas. Gamera kills the offsrping of the octopus. Gamera burns the alien ships. Gamera sings and dances. Gamera signs a treaty and uses a pen! Gamera then flys to the sun! The End Good i hope he burned!",1103155200,5,1474,4.52434456928839
1885963,5,B00009NHAN,"This is the fourth in the GAMERA/GAMMERA series. Its pretty clever in its plot. It is also the first  movie in this series to be aimed squarely at children. And children will certainly enjoy it the most. The original

title was GAMERA VS. SPACE MONSTER VIRAS But the title was

changed to DESTROY ALL PLANETS when American International

sold the film to TV in a package deal with DESTROY ALL MONSTERS.

No planets get destroyed at all, but we do get to see three lengthy

flashbacks to the monster battles from the previous movies. You will either love or hate this. Much of the destruction is also made up of stock footage from the first two films, some is even in black and white (its supposed to be tinted sepia or pink and orange during the fire scenes, but since this is a faded print it just looks B&W) You will probably hate

this. Much of the real fun involves two boyscouts having an adventure while trapped on an invading alien spacecraft. They discover all kinds

 of weird things. Overall,  an OK movie but  great fun for your younger kids.",1101945600,6,1053,4.489473684210527
1885964,4,B00009NHAN,First off for 6-8 dollars for this dvd the really is nothing to complain cus your getting an gamera vs viras which is kinda rare due it never been release before. GAMERA is back again when he runs into you can say a ALien ship which they want to invade earth to steal its resources and claim it as there own. Gamera destroys the first ship but they sent another ship to complete the mission but when it comes down to it the leader has to take care of the situation itself and fights gamera to the end. Basically the showa series showed more action and not a lot of kid action as in some other gamera flicks. The monster action was very great and showed good special effect even they look cheesy you have to remind yourself that this was made a long time ago. The showa gamera series mark it self as entertaining the kids rather then a mature older audience thats why you see  alot of kids acting a big part in every gamera series. This was indeed one of the best Gamera series to get so I would highly recommend it.,1089244800,2,1015,4.205128205128205
1885965,4,B00009NHAN,"Wow, this one took me back. That was great. I remember this one from a sunday afternoon one summer in the 1970's. KSTW 11's Sci-Fi Theater. Hahahaha. Anyways...
The picture quality on this DVD was better then I expected it to be after viewing the crappy print used on the War of the Monsters DVD from the same company. This one is much better.
The colors are pretty good considering the print used. I also picked up Gamera: Attack of the Monsters, which looks pretty good also...considering the budget release it is.
Unfortunatly, its full screen, instead of the original widescreen aspect ratio, which IS available on VHS! (that sucks weiners IMHO, why are we taking backwards steps here people?!? heheh)
So, if you like sci-fi flicks that remind you of weekend afternoon tv when you were a kid, or latenight tv when you were in college, or if you're just a fan of rubber monster movies, then grab this DVD while its out.
And... keep those fingers crossed for some widescreen attention to be paid to gamera!!!",1074902400,2,1010,4.679775280898877
1885966,3,B00009NHAN,"The fifth entry in the showa (1960s - 1980s gamera films) Gamera series, Gamera vs. Viras (Destroy all Planets as it was released in the US) is a most enjoyable, although juvenille film.
In the movie, two prank-loving boy scouts are kidnapped by aliens looking to take over the world.  Gamera attempts a rescue, only to be put under the Virian's (the aliens) control and forced to attack Japan.  The two boys find a way to put an end to the Virian's mind control and escape.  The Virans, in a last-ditch effort, fuse together into a gigantic, silver squid monster.  Can Gamera defeat Viras and save the earth? (well, i can't give away the ending, now can I?)
The quality of the print used is subpar, presenting a slightly faded picture and several scratches.  However, the film is still completely enjoyable in this form and could be a lot worse . . . trust me.  The audio is generally clear and crisp, showing little problems.
The DVD itself has little to show.  The menus are still images, with no music.  There is however a picture gallery and a chapter index.
As a hardcore kaiju (japanese monster movies) fan, I strongly recommend this DVD, even though its not in the best possible quality.",1065398400,4,1195,4.60377358490566

and saw it only once. I was enthralled with it then
and had always wished I could see it again.

1885978,3,B00009NHAN,"Forget the unimportant title.  This movie exists by other titles that are far more descriptive, such as ""Gamera vs. Viras.""  ""Destroy All Planets"" is a misnomer because there is only one planet shown in this movie, Earth, and the aliens want our planet for themselves.  The aliens do want to remove those pesky humans infesting the planet, but they want to keep the planet whole so they can move in.

Gamera movies seem to have a large following among children in Japan, because children always play central roles in Gamera movies.  This time we meet a crowd of boy scouts from Tokyo.  Two of the boys are quite mischievous, and manage to play a prank on highly educated scientists by changing wiring connections on their mini-sub.  The boys use this highly valuable lesson to later work their mischief on aliens.  I believe these children later went on to government service in the diplomatic corps, personally starting two regional conflicts, fourteen incidents, thirty two letters of dismay, and an effigy burning.

After the two boys sabotage the sub, they convince the same bumbling scientists, including Dr. Dobie (played by Peter Williams), to allow them to drive the sub.  Uh-huh.  I wonder why we have so little trust in some researchers.  These people are unable to prevent a couple of kids from sabotaging their multi-million dollar submersible.  Once the submersible is sabotaged, they are unable to figure out how the children did it.  Then, to add icing to the cake, these same people allow the children to pilot the sub.  I have to wonder whether the name Dr. Dobie is a birth name, or perhaps was a name given to him after something he may have smoked in college.  I am just speculating, but after his actions with the two boys, you have to wonder where this guy's head was at.

While the boys are taking a pleasure cruise in an expensive piece of research equipment, they encounter the giant turtle Gamera, also known as Gammera, who manages to make growly noises in outer space, walk upright, and shoot flames out of his leg holes.  Gamera is one talented turtle.

Somewhere early in this movie we are introduced to spaceship #1, which Gamera toasts with a move worthy of ""professional"" wrestling.  Soon we are introduced to spaceship #2, which has a crew of not-so-bright people and a guy in an octopus costume.  After the boys return from their three hour tour, the weather started getting rough, and their tiny sub was tossed, and if it wasn't for the spirit of the fearless...wait, wrong story.  Sorry.  Getting back on track, the boys cheer on Gamera, only to fall into the clutches of the evil aliens on spaceship #2.  The aliens prove about as bright as Dr. Dobie, which makes you wonder whether they were inhaling during the flight.

Early guys-in-monster-suits-destroying-Japan-models movies were often quite sincere.  The original ""Godzilla"" and ""Gamera the Invincible"" are two movies that tried hard to have a good story and a good scare factor.  By the time this movie came out, the studio had thrown sincerity out in favor of a children's fantasy.  With the children running the movie, the movie is often either intentionally or unintentionally funny.  In either case, this movie becomes a mediocre entry in the people in costumes monster movie genre.

The sound and picture quality are reasonable for this 1971 film, though the film could be re-mastered with modern technology.  The studio kept the budget low by using scenes from earlier Gamera movies, even though some of the reused scenes were in black and white.  The version I have is pan and scan rather than wide screen, which could be another addition if the original films are located.

Even though this low-budget flick is flawed, I recommend it to fans of Gamera movies, and fans of Japanese monster movies.  The plot is a re-hash of earlier plots, but the formula has worked for dozens of films.  Why mess with success?

Good luck!",1348444800,2,3925,4.823353293413174
1885979,2,B00009NHAN,"Can they succeed?  Is more of the nature of Gamera revealed?  Can the aliens use Gamera's brainwaves and memories against her?  Will the boy scout's older sister ever come to a true understanding of his nature?  Does this rival Ed Wood for cheesy effects?  What was Gamera's origin?  What were the worst threats that she faced (i.e. as in repeating the best of old fights)?  Does she still like humans?  Can humans ever regain their trust in her after the alines take over her mind?  Why is she protecting the Earth?  Can she replace the nice warm space in our hearts that Godzilla occupies?

If you MUST know the answers to these questions, I would recommend this.",1289433600,,665,4.598290598290598
1885980,4,B00009NHAN,"The quality of this disc is superior to the previous Retromedia Gamera releases, which were actually quite watchable.
This print has a better picture. I still have my VHS tape from TV
I recorded in 1984 and if its clearer than that, I'm easy to please.
As for the commentary. Enjoyable but with one setback.
Brett Homenick is a good host and Carl Craig, the movies American
star has some fun stories and points out some interesting detail.
The drawback to the commentary is Damon Foster, who barely utters
a word and only speaks up when he has something unrealistically
negative to say. In fact I would have to say that he comes across
as an angry mean spirited jerk. Did he get paid for this? It seems
that he hates Gamera movies. So, why pick him for the commentary
track? Anyone off the street seeing Destroy All Planets for the first time could offer a better commentary of the cuff. Even when clips
from War Of The Monsters, a movie Foster claims to like, he has
nothing at all to say. Damon, which monster crawled up your @$$
and died. Likely Guiron.",1288396800,,1056,4.476683937823834
1885981,3,B00009NHAN,"Now that Gamera vs Viras (The alternate title for this movie) has been released, and with an english voice track, I see very little reason get this version.

I've heard all Carl Craig's stories already-- if YOU haven't, this swingin' disc is a MUST HAVE. Three cheers to Brett Homenick and RetroMedia for pulling this together. And for what it's worth, this is the BEST print of DAP I've ever seen. I never knew the lights on the Viras starship PULSED until I saw this print. Thank you RetroMedia. I'd love to see Brett and Damon tackle the other public domain US Gamera movies-- I'd pay $19.99 for each. Gladly.  --- John ""Toyzilla"" Marshall",1280793600,2,640,4.714285714285714
1885983,5,B00009NHAN,"I was worried when I saw this was a DVD-R. Have no fear monster fans, this DVD from Retromedia is just like a regular DVD! The re-mastered DVD is much better than the previous DVD from the company! I loved the commentary, too. And you get nice cover artwork both on the disc and the disc sleeve. I would recommend this to ANY Gamera fan. Get this AND the Shout! Factory Gamera DVD's - ENJOY! Superb..More please Fred!",1278979200,6,417,4.358974358974359
1885984,3,B00009NHAN,"Retromedia's ""Destroy All Planets 2010"" is a bare-bones re-release of the full frame, English-dubbed AIP-TV version of the film featuring a marginally better print than found on previous discs, although the richer colors are often betrayed by the blurry, washed-out visuals you can expect from the budget releases of these films.

What sets ""2010"" apart from previous releases is the actor's commentary track hosted by Brett Homenick and Damon Foster and staring Carl Craig. Craig's insights into the production of this film are quite engaging, and Homenick knows how to steer the discussion without being intrusive.

Unfortunately, Craig's reflections are occasionally interrupted by Foster's boisterously feeble riffing of the Gamera films, and it appears that someone had their cell phone on while the commentary was recorded, as evidenced by the occasional beeping sounds.

Regardless, although I can't recommend this release to the average buyer, especially since you can purchase the same version of the film for $1 in any number of bargain bins or, better yet, Shout Factory's anticipated double bill of the Japanese versions of ""Gamera vs Gyaos"" and ""Gamera vs. Viras"" coming in the Fall, film buffs, historians, and die-hard fans will enjoy Craig's disembodied voice emanating from their television speakers.",1278028800,2,1317,5.477832512315271
1885985,4,B00009NHAN,"Retromedia upgrades it's previous release of DESTROY ALL PLANETS with a remastered video transfer and a commentary track.

The video transfer of the full frame AIP version of DESTROY ALL PLANETS is pretty good.  It's a relatively clean print and looks and sounds better than most of the other versions of this film that are out there in the grey market.  But the real reason to get this is the commentary track with star Carl Craig, who shares his experiences of making the film.  Carl has a great memory and shares many insights and recollections, the commentary continues throughout the film at a lively pace  and seldom gets boring.  The DVD is a DVD-R, but is otherwise professionally packaged and labelled.

Regarding the ""controversy"" of whether or not this is an authorized release; there are literally dozens of companies who have released the AIP version of DESTROY ALL PLANETS on DVD, to include a prior release from Retromedia.  I would wager that not too many were complaining about these before Shout! Factory began bringing prestine prints to the American market.  Regardless, my bet is that anyone who likes Gamera enough to buy Retromedia's DESTROY ALL PLANETS for the commentary track will also be buying Shout! Factory's GAMERA VS.

1885987,4,B00009NHAN,"Retromedia is allowed to release this as the AIP-TV version of this film is in the public domain.  AIP never bothered to copyright it since it was sold directly to TV stations, videotapes or any home video did not exist at that time (late 1960's or early 1970's), and the company felt that the film would have a very short shelf life (informed speculation on my part).

By that time copyright law had changed, so renewal after 28 years was no longer necessary, but they never registered their version to begin with, though I do believe that a copyright notice was placed on the film itself.  Well, before 1976 that was not sufficient; a copy of the film also had to be registered with the Copyright Office itself and a print of the film delivered to them.  Easy to see why AIP would not have bothered with this additional expense.  They could not forsee any future market for a foreign-made, dubbed, genre picture they felt would have a limited audience.

It is true that other companies copied Retromedia's DVD and released their own knock-off versions.  That stinks and is very uncool, but it is also quite legal.  The principle that allowed Retromedia to release the film to begin with also allowed other companies to copy Retromedia's DVD and sell it.  What people cannot do is copy Carl Craig's commentary track, which is new and copyrightable.  On that basis, Retromedia does have exclusive content.  Whether or not that audio track makes this DVD worthwhile is up to each customer.

Also, Shout! Factory is releasing an original version of the film, from Japan, with the original Japanese dialog track and new English subtitles.  This version has remained in copyright in Japan, and therefore, is still under copyright.  People cannot just copy that version and sell it.  That would be illegal.  But the AIP version is up for grabs.  AIP was authorized to create it by the Japanese studio under contract, but they never registered it in the USA.",1277337600,8,1952,4.761904761904762

Retromedia was the first company to ever present the AIP-TV Gamera films to the public on DVD and quickly became the source of material for all the cheap DVD labels that flooded the market afterwards. Retromedia also successfully initiated and won a copyright case based on their release of DESTROY ALL PLANETS, so your claim of illegality is BS as well. This DVD doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't. It's simply the best edition of the AIP-TV version of the film ever released on DVD and it has an actors commentary track with star Carl Craig. That's all it advertises as being and that's what it is.

Oh yeah! In an attempt to promote racial harmony, one of the brats is Caucasian and the other is Japanese. It's kind of hard to tell until the bright red-headed mom shows up to wail ""Jim!

Seems kind of silly when we learn later on that when Gamera is flipped on his back he's just about helpless! So the aliens find out that Gamera is a softy for kids, and that's when the fun begins. The kids are snatched, Gamera is mind-controlled by the aliens, there's a giant squid with a pointy nose that turns out to be the head honcho who eventually gets around to battling with Gamera.
