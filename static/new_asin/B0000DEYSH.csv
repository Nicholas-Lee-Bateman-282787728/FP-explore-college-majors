8000897,1,B0000DEYSH,The DVD for a coaching resource is very short and the exercises not shown for long enough to support coaches in developing their inderstanding of what the pertinent points are. The DVD is very dated also so some of the the tactical elements are obselete.,1317600000,,254,4.666666666666667

8000900,4,B0000DEYSH,"This video gives you a comprehensive explanation of the 4-4-2 formation of soccer, with highlights on how to run the flat back four defense, with great positioning pointers.  I would recommend this video if you are just learning this formation or need to brush up on it.",1220400000,,270,4.74468085106383
8000901,5,B0000DEYSH,"What genius!! This instruction made everything that seemed nearly impossible to understand , simple. Meaning, how to organize and properly instruct what will become a competent and disciplined ZONAL defence. The drills presented here are great. I only wish i could find such a product like this one designed to better explain the catenaccio system of play.
