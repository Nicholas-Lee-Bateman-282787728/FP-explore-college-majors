8159638,1,B000007PA3,"I thought I was going to like Death Warmed Up (called Death Warmed Over on IMDB). For starters the description I read talks about zombies, and I do like zombie movies. Titles from Night of the Living Dead to Resident Evil line my shelves.

I could tell from the start that this was going to be low budget and probably campy, but neither aspect is necessarily a bad thing. It still showed promise initially.  Dr. Howell, a man who doesn't mind experimenting on humans, brainwashes young Michael into killing his parents in order to get Michael's dad, a doctor who disagreed with Howell's practices, out of the way.

Flash forward a few years and Michael is being released from a mental institution.  He has tracked Howell down to an island research facility and is out for revenge.  He's taking a few of his young friends to the island under the ruse of a vacation so he can have a look around and maybe get a shot at the mad doctor.

So far so good.  It's a good setup.  I was ready for Michael to go up to the guy and say something along the lines of, Hello.  My name is Michael (whatever his last name is).  You made me kill my father.  Prepare to die.

Unfortunately the story soon dissolves into a series of mindless chase scenes and standoffs that don't really have much story to them and aren't done well enough to be worth watching on their own.  There's virtually no emotional impact, excitement, or any other reason to keep watching.

What about the zombies? you ask?  Hrumph, this is as much a zombie movie as is a racing movie because there's a car chase.  Some of Howell's current experiments have become little more than mindless animals.  Towards the end they get loose and cause some havoc on the island.  There's your zombies.

The acting is not great but could be worse I suppose.  These are not all unknown actors, though.  Michael Hurst, at least, I enjoyed in the Hercules series.

Ultimately I got bored despite all the action. I quickly quit caring about Michael or any of the other characters. Now that a few days have passed since watching it I can't even recall exactly how it ended. Maybe I fell asleep. Maybe I'm still asleep. Maybe you are, too, and we're just sharing a dream in which I'm writing a review that you're reading. Or maybe I don't exist at all and this is all just inside your own head.

As Im getting ready to post this review Im surprised to see that hardly anyone dislikes this movie as much as I do, and quite a few people actually really enjoy it. It just goes to prove that you shouldnt take the opinion of just one review as definitive. Maybe this one just didn't connect with me like it does other viewers. It wouldnt be the first time.

Content:
Violence is frequent and bloody with a bit of gore including exploding heads and removing parts of skulls for brain surgery. Theres some nudity, sex, and innuendo. Strong language is frequent and sometimes vulgar.

DVD:
I got it in a 50 pack called Night Screams. The audio is low quality but not terrible except for a few notable glitches here and there. The image is a little smudgy and out of focus. It's also pretty grainy. There are no extras.

I thought I saw a region 1 DVD edition at one point, but currently all I can find are imports and streaming video.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
Do yourself a favor and check out a good review from someone who likes Death Warmed Up for a conflicting perspective. It only gets 1* from me, though. If you do want it you're pretty much limited to Night Screams, a region 2 DVD, or streaming.",1523491200,,3522,4.43701399688958

8159641,3,B000007PA3,"Michael picked a bad time to be late for work in the neurosurgery department. His punishment? Suspension? Verbal warning? Heck, no, try becoming a test subject for Dr. Howell's out of control experimentation on ""curing"" death! After the results makes Michael go on a mini killing spree and being placed in a psyche ward, the mad doctor moves and sets up shop on a remote island. Seven years later, Michael (now with bleach blonde hair) is released from the cuckoo's nest and plans a ""vacation"" with a group of friends on a certain island retreat where certain experiments are still being conducted. Purely coincidental... not. This low budgeter from further down under (New Zealand) has ample bloody FX to appease the gorehounds and enough oddball characters to keep attention spans riveted, only to be unsatisfied in the end once it's realized there was nobody in the film to really care about that much in the first place. 5.25/10",1291420800,,932,4.905063291139241
8159642,3,B000007PA3,"A guy (Michael Hurst) is given an experimental drug that causes him to kill his parents w/ a shotgun. He is then committed to a mental institution for seven years. Upon his release, our hero takes a trip w/ his girlfriend and another couple to a remote island. The same island where he'd received the drug! You see, he's out for revenge against the doctor who destroyed his life, and nothing's gonna stop him! However, there's more going on than he realizes, including twisted brain surgeries that have helped the evil doctor create an army of crazed zombies! This one's rather grim, w/ a few humorous moments in between the exploding heads and impalements. There's even a bit of nudiness near the beginning! Not too awful, just don't expect a masterpiece...",1156550400,,758,4.793893129770993
