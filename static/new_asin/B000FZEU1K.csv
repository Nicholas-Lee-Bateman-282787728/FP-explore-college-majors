2596064,4,B000FZEU1K,"Having read the original novel ""Third Man Out,"" I have to agree that the screenplay for the movie version was reasonably well adapted.  Since I wasn't a huge fan of the book, ""reasonably well adapted"" to me means that 90% of the book was changed.  The movie is loaded with gritty sex and violence that the novel was just missing.  Occupations were changed (in the case of one character, from a meteorologist to a singing, puppet-wielding, male Shari Lewis wannabe), motives were changed, personalities were beefed up or changed, scenes were added, a distasteful, unnecessary, and preachy subplot was completely deleted, and the story was transplanted from an obviously early 1990's setting to a vaguely 30's-era seeming present day.  None of these are complaints, mind you; everything has been improved.  Dramatically.

Unfortunately, whoever adapted the screenplay neglected to change the atrociously bad ending. It negates scenes which took place earlier in the movie, tries to make a point and fails, and is altogether best left unviewed--stop your DVD player about fifteen minutes before the end if you want a satisfactory viewing experience.  Without spoiling anything, the twist itself was fine--clever, actually--but various characters' reactions to it were so untrue to life as to be almost offensive.  When a character in a movie makes a grand speech at the end that causes other characters to hang their heads in shame, you at least expect the speech to make an ounce of sense and to have any persuasive power whatsoever.  Instead, my reaction (to both the book and the movie) was a simple, ""Uh huh.  Right."" Actually, the movie's version of the ending was even worse than the book's, for various reasons.

That, however, is the only reason for a 4-star instead of a 5-star review, and even I wouldn't expect anyone to completely change (or leave out) the ending when adapting a book into a screenplay.  The acting is stellar from all of the principals (particularly Chad Allen) and most of the peripherals (I enjoyed the young hotel desk clerk especially), the direction is top-notch and the production values are impressive.  I am greatly looking forward to the next Strachey movie.

The only extra on the DVD is a featurette which is actually well worth viewing, particularly for the relevant comments of Chad Allen, who makes more sense than I've ever heard a Hollywood actor make in my life.",1156291200,40,2406,5.0125628140703515
2596065,5,B000FZEU1K,"""THIRD MAN OUT: A Donald Strachey Mystery"" (2005) stars openly-gay actor Chad Allen, as the Albany NY gay private eye made popular by the series of novels by Richard Stevenson.

In this first in a series of HERE!TV made-for-cable films based on the series, Donald is hired by John Rutka (Jack Weatherall, who was Uncle Vic in Showtime's ""Queer As Folk"" series), a controversial gay activist known for ""outing"" closeted gays who publicly oppose equal rights. Rutka has received numerous death threats based on his work, and hires Strachey for protection following his hospitalization for a gunshot wound. However, Strachey finds out that Rutka orchestrated the shooting, to try to call attention to the more serious threats he has received, and drops the case for deceiving him.  The next day, Rutka is announced as the victim of a kidnapping and murder, where the body was burned so badly that dental records and the gunshot would were the only things that identified him.  Stunned by the news, Strachey vows to help Rutka's surviving lover solve the mystery of his death, concentrating on three individuals who were likely to be ""outed"" by him in future months, and would therefore benefit by his being silenced.

Having read the original book, I thought tha screenplay adaptation was excellent, and the movie was well-acted and produced.  The director intentionally gave the piece a 1930's ""film noir"" feel, as a homage to his appreciation for the ""Thin Man"" series of that era. Allen is believeable in the role, and the chemistry is good with the actor who plays his life partner.  Veteran character actor Weatherall is perfect as Rutka, as are those in supporting roles. Porn star Matthew Rush has a cameo as an informant.  Rated R for sexual content and nudity, extras on the DVD are limited to trailers and a ""Making of"" featurette.  I give it a full five stars out of five.",1155168000,7,1880,4.871473354231975
2596066,5,B000FZEU1K,"This is one of the most satisfying ""gay"" films I've seen since ""Beautiful Thing,"" and one of the best mystery-married pairings since John and Sherlock, or should I say Nick and Nora. It's the story of Donald Strachey, tough guy P.I. with a shady past and a sweet tooth for guy pal Sebastian Spence. It's a good story, not a great one, with a sultry jazz score and topical references to such controversial subjects as celebrity outing and pedophiliac priests. What makes it work is the unconventional casting of Chad Allen (who is gay himself, but whose somewhat beat-up good looks don't conform to cinematic stereotypes of gay--although one character dubs him ""Nancy-boy Drew"") as Strachey, who just happens to be very happily married to Timothy (played by Sebastian Spence, who is apparently straight, and maybe that's why his character overdoes the nelly a bit). Allen, as Strachey, is developing very nicely as an actor, and he's more interesting looking now than he ever was as a child. In ""Third Man Out,"" he gets solid support from QAF's Jack Wetherall and Sean Young. Apparently, this is the first in a series, based on the novels by Richard Stevenson and set, contrarily, in Albany, rather than in New York City or San Francisco. Hopefully, it will prove popular enough with its intended audience that other books in the series will also be filmed. Apart from the rather pedestrian direction (by Ron Oliver) and a couple of too obvious twists in the plot, ""Third Man"" is entertaining throughout.",1154476800,87,1503,4.875

I thought the acting was solid and him and actor who plays Timmy had a great chemistry together.

Now, I do think the ending was strange, not because it was not interesting or did not fit the story, but because I just had trouble seeing Donald agreeing to what he did agree, otherwise great movie with likeable cast.",1372291200,,677,4.207692307692308

2596084,4,B000FZEU1K,"This is a gay crime mystery that was made for a TV audience and once you get your head around that, that then you know that there will be limitations both in  terms of budget and bedroom wrangling.  It stars Chad Allen who plays Donald Strachey; he is a Private Investigator who was once a cop. He has a live in boyfriend in Timmy (Sebastian Spence) they have moved into a new home and it is being renovated by `Dykes on Bikes'  a la `Petrocelli' the eighties cop that never finished his home.

Strachey drives a battered up heap of rubbish that is as reliable as a Mexican rail time table. A la `Colombo' eighties TV cop. He is gay so likes to suck on things a la `Kojak' seventies TV cop (lollies). So a bit of a composition of cops we have seen before. And what is wrong with that, as just because his sexual orientation is not the same that he should be completely different in all respects.

He gets hired by one of those gay activists that go around `outing' hypocrites. He has been receiving threats and thinks his life is in danger. The thing is he has upset so many people that Strachey tells him to keep his money and his job and his hot boyfriend - might have wanted to think through the last one.

The plot develops and you know our lovable cop will take on the role. There are some questionable bits like the car in the studio with the background being projected; I have not seen that for a while. There are more than a few clichs and some seriously questionable acting including `Dick Steel' enough said.

Despite all of the above I really liked it, it has a heart and a soul and there were some quite funny moments even if they were painfully signposted on more than one occasion, if you grew up liking Scooby Doo before you started to like males of the two legged variety (or three if you are really lucky), then the plot twists will not be a problem at all. If you want something devilishly deep and sinister then this should go on your rental `c' list.

2596086,4,B000FZEU1K,"#Possible spoilers in review#

Based upon Richard Stevenson's series, Here TV bought the rights to turn these books into movies. Although they filmed the books out of sequence, starting with number four instead of one, the movies still make sense even if you haven't read the books. For fans of the books, the movies differ from them in significant ways and while I have read the  books, I have to admit I like Ron Oliver's (the director) take on Donald and Timmy's relationship better in the movies. Since the books were written in the 1980's, they have that era's flavor and to me were dated. So they needed to be modernized for a current television audience, which is what Oliver did.

In book canon, Donald was a divorced man just figuring out he's gay. Now in the movies, he's a former Marine intelligence officer, who was discharged because he was gay, who is out private detective in Albany, New York. In the books, Timothy Callahan was Donald's casual lover, but in the movies, Timmy is all but his husband - they wear matching wedding bands. Timmy is a state Senator's aid and a former Jesuit priest. They live together, are completely monogamous and have a dog named Doctor Watson. The movies have taken out the casual sex of the books and added in romance, commitment and fidelity into the storyline, which I feel enhances the Timmy and Donald relationship to make it the core element of the movies.

In ""Third Man Out,"" Donald is approached by John Rutka, who runs a web site that outs gay men in Albany. His web site has inspired death threats following a campaign of forced outings of important people in town. Donald doesn't like Rutka and declines the job until Rutka is kidnapped and burned alive, then he is determined to find out who killed the man. What follows is Donald's investigation into the seedier side of Albany politics and religion and the secrets everyone seems to be hiding. But will Donald's crusade to find the truth endanger the ones he loves?

What draws me to these movies is the love, trust and chemistry between Donald and Timmy. Chad Allen (who is gay) and Sebastian Spence (who is not gay), do an incredible job of portraying a loving, committed couple who just happen to solve crimes together. If you watch the Behind the Scenes extras, you will see Chad talk about how he and Sebastian wanted the love scenes to be realistic and natural, and Chad wanted Sebastian to feel comfortable. These two actors have amazing chemistry together and it just gets better and better as the movies progress. Each movie is filled with a topic relevant to the gay community today (forced outings, so-called `straight' therapy, hate crimes, etc.). Plus Ron Oliver evokes a 1940's flair with the films, especially the last two that are reminiscent of film noir pieces and it fits in just perfectly with the Nick and Nora theme.

So, if you're in the mood for a little mystery, romance and a detective that kicks ass on the bad guys and comes home to his long-term partner every night, then this is the movie series for you.

2596097,5,B000FZEU1K,"Third Man Out (2006) Here! Films
 John Rutka (Jack Wetherall) was the most hated man in New York State.  He knew what people thought of him.  That he was a liar and needed to die.  His mission is to ""OUT"" the closeted bigots who he feels are working against gay rights.  Rutka has spent a lifetime and a small fortune collecting ""proof"".  These files were then used to inflict revenge.  After surviving being shot in his own home, he turns to Albany's only gay detective, Don Strachey (pronounced STRAY- che) (Chad Allen).  Only this detective wants nothing to do with him either!
 Here! Television network approached award wining director Ron Oliver with an interesting proposition.  Do a series of films based on the popular crime novels by author Richard Stevenson.  They could not have achieved a better outcome.  In over 100 years of film mysteries, there has never been a gay detective.  Third man Out accomplishes much more than a sexual preference change of cast.  It stands on its own with the best ""whodunit"" ever to come out of Hollywood's heyday.
 While it acknowledges the Film Noir genre, this story is as fresh as the morning's cable headlines or evening blog.  The movie is seasoned throughout with elements of Dashiell Hammett and Erle Stanley Gardner.  But don't expect the typical climax with a room full of suspects or even a courtroom confession. This movie stands up to multiple viewing and never lets you down.  It pays homage to the martini drinking couple ""Nick and Nora Charles"".  In this film, ""Donald and Tim"", are a modern couple that today's gay audience can relate to.  A couple who have to face the same everyday challenges we all do.
 Private investigator Strachey has had to make a living mostly by following cheating husbands and taking pictures.  In his line of work, he gets hit in the face allot. His life partner, Tim Callahan (Sebastian Spence) serves as a chief aide to Senator Dianne Glassman (P. Lynn Johnson).  Their home is not going to fix itself so Don is tempted by the money John Rutka has offered.  Tim wants no part of it.  He points out that Rutka and his files have destroyed people's lives.  There are such things as absolute ""Rights"" and ""Wrongs"" and he doesn't want Don involved with a ""wrong"" in any way. Police detective ""Bub"" Bailey (Daryl Shuttleworth) has known Rutka since they were kids.  He wants Strachey to talk his client into leaving town.  He even offers to ""let certain things slide...""
 Our hero's gut is telling him that he is being used.  Then Rutka goes too far by threatening Don with knowledge of the detectives past.  That does it and Strachey is out of there!  In the morning, Don gets a call from Rutka's younger lover Eddie (Woody Jeffreys) confirming the morning news: John Rutka's burned corpse was found overnight.
 The death puts a new spin on the action.  Donald knows the police will search the home for the files.  Anyone who gets them has a ready made blackmailing business. Wither out of sympathy or guilt, Strachey agrees to hide the files.  They hold to the key to the murder.  However this puts his beloved Timmy in mortal danger.  Now even Timmy wants Don to find the killer for their own safety.
 Suspects are coming out of the woodwork.  Everyone wants to get their hands on those files!  Just a few include: a powerful Congressman into S&M on the sly, (David Palffy), a puppeteer on children's television who is hiding much more than his hands (Sean Carey), and a slimy used car dealer who pretends being an upstanding church member (Scott Swanson).  Maybe the crooked motel clerk (Richard Cox) had his rubber-gloves in this.  How about someone in the police department?  Could they have a motive?  Then there's the Porn Star (Mathew Rush) who has found a way to supplement his ""acting"" income.  He runs a bank of telephone sex workers, each one pretending to be the star himself.
 Yet they all seem angry at being cheated out of the grand prize -- the personal gratification from killing John Rutka themselves.
 Everywhere Don looks he finds more people who can't be trusted.  Even the files hamper him by only listing people's initials.  It's going to take all of his street smarts to clear up this one before it finishes not only him by also his happy home.  Chad Allen really gets to expand his considerable acting ""chops"" in this film.  After viewing his gritty portrayal, you can't imagine anyone else in the part.  His personal journey from TV teen idol to a working ""out"" gay actor is inspiring.  One can see the resemblance to a young James Cagney.
 No clues are hidden in this contest of wills.  Everything is all out in the open for us to see.  Like in the old ""Thin Man"" movies, you'll find all of the typical elements: from a blood soaked suspect to a smoky night club complete with a jazz singer and people dressed in their evening attire.  Things might look familiar but nothing is as it seems.
 Just as we are about to savor the ending, it takes off again in a completely different direction!  Soon you'll want your own martini, which we are informed should be shaken to the beat of a waltz!  Third Man Out is just the first.  There are three more movies in this series, each as good as or better than the one before. What a gift it would be to have a boxed set!  How about it Amazon?",1306800000,2,5296,4.609860664523044
2596098,5,B000FZEU1K,"I enjoyed this first film adaptation of the Donald Strachey novels. Modern but tinged with stylish retro touches (opening credits, martinis, etc.) as the talented Chad Allen expertly handles the role of a gay detective asserting himself in a sometimes indifferent world. We are introduced to the charming & amusing relationship between Strachey & his conservative city official husband, Tim Callahan (played wonderfully by Sebastian Spence). Here, Strachey (begrudgingly, because he & Tim need the money) takes on the case of a not-so-loved gay activist (Jack Wetherall from ""Queer as Folk"") who feels he's doing public officials a favor by outing them, with Strachey's ethics at odds with his. Sure enough, amidst death threats, someone does do the man in, and the plot thickens, as some unusual suspects complicate matters.
Allen seems to be the perfect Strachey from the get-go; Spence is equally good as Tim, but needs to pull back the prissiness a bit. ""Third Man Out"" is a good start for the series; but the best is yet to come with the following novel adaptations.

Up until viewing ""Third Man out"" which is based on a Donald Starchey novel, I've always had to translate the Detective/Mystery film that I was experiencing into my own particular lifestyle.  Not with ""Third Man out"".  It required NO translation on my part; it is a film that I can understand completely--a gay detective, a story about the murder of a rather radical gay activist with suspects ranging from closeted government officials, church hierarchy to the man's own partner.  Added to this is a wonderful sound tract, a smoked filled night club with martinis, a ""cool"" jazz singer, a plot with many twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat, unsavory nasty looking characters, the question if it is right thing to do  to ""out"" hypocritical powerful individuals or not and MOST OF ALL, wonderfully acted lead roles that are filled with very appealing actors.

Chad Allen is simply great as a very tough gay detective that only shows his ""soft side"" in dealing with his partner as played so marvelously and with lots of humor by Sebastian Prince.  In fact, all of the actors in this film are wonderful. I particularly liked Jack Wetheral (the uncle in ""Queer as Folks"") as the ""gay activist"".

2596127,4,B000FZEU1K,"""Third Man Out"" proves to be a pretty good movie packed with ""film noir"" moments and a lot of mystery, suspense and drama. The best part of this film is without doubt, it's star actor Chad Allen, who gives a wonderful performance as ""Donald Strachey"". Strachey is a gay private detective hired to find who has been threatening a notorious member of the gay community noted for outing prominent people living a double life. When he refuses the case and the notorious John Rutka is reported to have been murdered, Strachey is compelled to solve the crime in spite of his personal disdain for the deceased. To do so, Strachey must protect hundreds of extensive files Rutka kept on high profile individuals he felt were a threat to the gay community. All hell breaks loose when he and his lover become the target of those who had a motive to kill Rutka and are seeking to destroy any evidence which might place them at the top of the list of suspects.

I was intrigued throughout the film to stick with it and find out ""who dunnit"". Never really a dull moment in this first gay mystery movie. The acting was very well done by almost every one of the nearly all-gay cast. A little overacting on the part of Sebastian Spence, who plays the part of Strachey's boyfriend. Not a bad performance, but probably not best suited for the particular role of the more feminine character. This was a role for which I felt the writing could have been more realistic. Allen's character was perfect, macho and more ""straight natured"" which fit him to a tee. His acting was flawless. I felt the scripting for the character of Rutka to be written a bit sloppy, and the combination of John Wetherall (Rutka) and Woody Jeffreys as his gay lover Eddie, to be a bit strange, but somehow it worked in spite of that. All in all, the actors all gave a great performance considering the script they were given to work with. There were a few things here and there that I was personally not impressed with, such as one unnecessary political reference that I found very distasteful, a little too much flame in the script for Strachey's lover Timmy, and a few unbelievable lines that I felt could have been much more convincingly written. There was the tattoo that changed from one arm in one scene, to the other arm at one point in the film, and I think a little more attention should have been given to detail throughout. All in all though, this is a great movie, very well done, and a first for gay media. Not your typical ""coming-out"" theme, or dime a dozen gay film topics. It was a nice twist making a GAY police drama, and I personally enjoyed viewing it. If you like suspense and mystery, you are gonna like this film.

There is also a great DVD extra for your viewing. It is a featurette with behind the scenes interviews with the cast. It is well worth watching and fills in a few details you may miss the first time you watch the film. This screenplay is Loosely adapted from the novel ""Third Man Out"", and the first of a series of Donald Strachey films. I will be watching for the next one. Hopefully it will be a little better written and directed than the first, BUT that being said, I highly recommend this movie. Just don't go overboard with your expectations. It's not the best mystery flick you've ever seen, but the gay theme behind it, gives it a nice flair, and the acting of Chad Allen makes it well worth watching. A great mystery that will keep your attention and dispense a few surprises along the way.",1180224000,8,3493,4.481946624803768
2596128,3,B000FZEU1K,"I'm not familiar with the book that this movie is based on, so I can't make a fair comparison of the two.  This film, though not the same caliber as ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Maurice"", is still a decent addition into the genre of gay films and a fairly decent mystery film.

Much of the film's success certainly is due to the likeablity of Chad Allen as Donald Strachey, a private eye who is hired by a loathesome man who's life is spent outing politicians and celebrities on his website.  When the man turns up murdered, Strachey is unwillingly drawn in to the mystery of his death.

QAF's Jack Wetherall does a fair job as the murdered man Strachey is originally hired to protect.  Sean Young appears (barely) in a role that can't be considered more than a cameo role.  And Sebastien Spence, as Donald's lover Tim, strives just a little too hard to prove that he's a friend of Dorothy---little white dog in tow each time he's in their apartment is just a little too much for me.

The director could have upped the suspense factor a little and, if needed, tinkered more with the storyline and characters.  Overall, however, its a decent movie.  Now that the second of an apparent series is out, it will be interesting to see it and compare the two.  Let's hope the director strives to improve on what could be an entertaining franchise.

This is the first in a planned series of films, about out detective Donald Strachey, and his loving partner Tim. Donald is hired by a gay muck-raker, John Rutka, after he's been shot in the leg. Rutka fears someone he has publicly outed is responsible, and wants them stoped before it's too late.

The production values, so lacking in most gay films, are top-notch, and the script is well paced, never allowing the story to drag. The direction is crisp and the performances are well rounded and three dimensional.

It is so refreshing to see a truly loving and strong gay relationship portrayed on screen, and the relationship here is the real foundation of the film.

2596133,3,B000FZEU1K,"I LOVE murder mysteries - and this is a nice example of a competent piece of work and an enjoyable mystery to watch.
I LOVE gay-themed movies that show being gay is normal.  And for that I liked this film, but it's not the only reason.  Good acting, good story, believable relationship portrayal. Is this more believable because Chad Allen is GAY? Could be - whatever it is this is a good watch.
I did like Chad Allen in this - he played it straight (not in the sense of denying he was gay), showing being married to the same sex is ok (which it damned well is), and you do all the normal stuff like renovating your home and loving your partner, openly dining in a nice restaurant and (horrors) dancing with them on the dance floor in public actually touching and looking like you are loving it.

The atmosphere created within the movie with lighting and the story treatment reminds me of the old detective movies - and this is done deliberately.  It has the feel of a 1940's detective story - with old fashioned foot work, fists at midnight (and all the other hours of the day) and quirky.  The modern touch is added with the introduction of the male partner instead of the female moll.  Loving it, I really am.

If I am going to criticise - the ending of the detective story part was weak for me.  It annoyed me quite frankly.  But hey, that is just a small part of the satisfying whole.  The ending of the movie is like a satisfied sigh.

This is part of a series and the next one ""Shock to the System"" develops the characters and the storyline improves.  In the next one you get to see the relationship mature, both the on-screen portrayal AND the obvious compatability of the main characters.  Well worth a watch - I pull it out when there is nothing else I want to see...it satisfies, so does ""Shock to the System"".

I can't quite put my finger on it, except the plot, interesting and full at first, spins farther and farther out of control until it completely disintegrates at the end.

I was also annoyed at the brown-ish hues and fake-feeling nostalgic nods to the early 1930's, super-imposed on the present day.  This film tries to be something it's not. It didn't work for me.

And it's too long with too many twists and unnecessary characters who behave in really strange and annoying ways.

I thoroughly enjoyed Chad Allen and his character and the scenes with his husband, which were clearly a joy for him to film.  The featurette (on the DVD) with the director and primary actors is also noteworthy, and possibly more interesting than whole portions of the film.

So, don't throw the baby out with the bath water.  This is a film worth seeing for the ambitious and, at times, successful moments and characters, and simply for Chad Allen.

2596142,4,B000FZEU1K,"After seeing years upon years of detective shows, like ""The Thin Man"" , ""Peter Gun"", ""Burke's Law"" , ""Columbo"" or ""CSI"", it is very interesting to see a very gay interpretation of this genre.

Chad Allen holds the center of attention as he tries to sort out the murder of his client, a journalist who specializes in 'outing' celebrities, priests, and politicians. Chad is supported in his work by a sophisticated and handsome life-partner, played by Sebastian Spence. This couple discusses the odds and ends of the detective's case over nightclub dancing and frequent martinis. Their clever banter and deliberation reminded me of Nick and Nora Charles in the ""Thin Man"" series.

Because Chad Allen conducts most of the investigation and engages in most of the action without his partner, he reminded me of the old ""Peter Gun"" type of detective, getting beat up by thugs, rounded up by the police, and shot at periodically as he gets closer to the ""truth"".

The client, played very well by Jack Wetherall (the superb uncle with AIDS in Queer as Folk), is on multiple hit-lists due to his ability to collect information on the man-on-man sexual activities of local politicians, Catholic priests, and entertainment celebrities.  I found it interesting that the character played by Wetherall was regarded extremely poorly by Allen and his crowd. Politicians who vote against gay-rights legislation yet enjoy a hidden gay sex life should be exposed, in my opinion. Thus I sympathized with the character played by Wetherall.

The theme of pedophile priests was also present but not really as well developed as the 'outing' aspect of the story.

If there is any weakness, it is a screenplay whereby all the gay suspects spill their nelly beans when Chad Allen says ""boo"". Like in ""Perry Mason"", the suspects tell-all when the least bit of pressure is applied. One fellow secretly films all the sexual adventures in his hotel and sells the dirt on his clientele, yet he gives Allen all the information he needs when Allen threatens to smash a porcelain desk elephant.

There is much masculine eye-candy in the film also. Woody Jeffreys plays Jack Wetherall's handsome young lover while muscle bound porno star Matthew Rush plays a porno star (go figure!) and provides the only full frontal nudity in the film.

Overall it is a fun film, a gay satire on all the pseudo-sophisticated detective stories we watched as kids.",1162080000,3,2411,4.9504950495049505
2596143,5,B000FZEU1K,"This has to be one of my favorite gay-themed movies that I've recently bought. I was glad to have bought this because I had two bad movies in the mix with this one for my last purchase. It was a sigh of relief. The character that Chad Allen plays, Donald Strachey, is done wonderfully. He has this tough side that he uses for work as a P.I. dectective, but then when he comes home to Timothy, his partner, and becomes this sweet, caring, thoughtful, loving man that wants to just separate his work from home life.

By taking on the task of protecting John Rutka, an outspoken gay activist, he soon realizes that some people aren't really who they say they are. He comes to find out that the type of person John Rutka is is really a man that believes that people should be honest about their sexuality, and doesnt see the harm in outing people when they haven't done so already themselves. We see that some politicans, tv actors, and a priest are really gay themselves, but do everything in their power to keep that part of them a secret and really just away from the press.

I'm so glad that I bought this movie, you should defidently go and purchase this movie, it's worth your while. A++++",1159228800,3,1191,4.409090909090909
2596144,5,B000FZEU1K,"If you're craving a soapy queer fix now that Queer as Folk is no longer lathering it up, then the Queer-Noir private eye thriller Third Man Out is sure to soothe your ache. The plot may be a bit serpentine and the dialogue stretched at the corners to cover maximum political ground, but Chad Allen's nuanced and sexily hard-boiled performance easily compensates for these shortcomings. As Private Eye Donald Strachey, Allen comes off as Spenser crossed with Columbo with a dash of Brian Kinney tossed into this enticing mix.

Though Ron Oliver's direction isn't flashy, it's very appropriate for a noir flick set in Albany. Like Richard Stevenson's books--on the pages of which Donald Strachey was conceived--this film is about character and concept and the tension between these two dramatic elements. Stevenson was one of the first writers to infuse the pragmatic, ultra-masculine private eye genre with an unabashedly gay aesthetic. A perfect synthesis of these two influences, Third Man Out gives us a detective who shares waltzes and moonlight martinis with his hubby, drives a banged up Toyota Tercel and can lay bad guys flat with an unsparing right hook.

Third Man's production values are outstanding for a cable film. Keeping Richard Stevenson's Albany setting was a smart move by Here! network, as so many well intentioned films go astray when they aim for glitzy settings and end up with cheap Canadian photocopies.

The only flaws worth citing were: a couple of actor Sebastian Spence's scenes (during which he portrays Donald Strachey's husband as a cross between C3PO and Uncle Arthur from Bewitched) and a heavy-handed score (with good feature songs that are sandbagged by some very obtrusive ""tension and suspense"" instrumentals).

What most delighted me about Third Man was the thrill of watching a genuine and polished noir flick which was, in every respect, thoroughly but naturally queer. While Third Man isn't Brokeback Mountain, it is a milestone in its own right. It's a well executed, enjoyable film about a hard-boiled detective who wears bad ties and breaks out in a blushing grin when his boyfriend kisses him on the cheek.",1159056000,3,2151,5.084985835694051

2596146,4,B000FZEU1K,"Ron Oliver is to be commended for bringing this first story from the Donald Strachey Mysteries by Richard Stevenson (screenplay by Mark Saltzman) to the screen.  This first story is so well written, directed, acted and filmed that it can only give us hope that the other novels in the Donald Strachey series will be forthcoming.

The story is a modern detective story that takes place in Albany, New York and is complete with realistic characters, a fine plot well paced, and a number of twists and turns that keep the audience not only entertained but glued to the screen.  The difference, here, is that the detective Strachey (Chad Allen in an impressive performance) happens to be a gay man, well adjusted, living with his wholesome and tender partner Timmy (Sebastian Spence).  The action involves a gay activist John Rutka (Jack Wetherall) with a penchant for outing political figures whose agenda is not friendly to the community.  He likewise lives with a healthy life partner Eddie (Woody Jeffreys) and the two seem targeted for death by apparent candidates for Rutka's next outing computer magazine.  Strachey is engaged to protect Rutka despite initial, partner-supported feelings that Rutka disrupts closeted men's lives too ruthlessly.  But take the case on he does and he proves to be not only smart but wise while remaining a lovable detective. The plots thickens and surprises are everywhere just as good detective mysteries should have.  But along the way the film takes the time to make some cogent statements about the clergy and politicians and other significant matters that raises this movie to a fine level of social consciousness.

The cast is excellent and the love scenes are beautifully presented. There is even some beefcake (Matthew Rush as the 'Dik Steele' porn star in the buff) and club scenes to lighten the action.  The film includes a superb featurette with Ron Oliver discussing how the film made it to the screen and includes for once some healthy conversation from openly gay actors who are enlightened about their roles.  Though obviously a 'gay film', the story and production are so strong that any audience will find this a fine mystery!  Highly recommended.

The first film is actually the fourth novel in the series by Richard Lipez, and shows Strachey is an impossible situation. The Detective is hired by John Rutka (Jack Wetherall) a gay extremist, who runs a website that is actually devoted to outing celebrities. Rutka had been receiving death threats, which is nothing new, but when he's shot in his own home, he needs protection and doesn't trust anyone outside of the gay community. Strachey loaths the man and doesn't believe his story, but reluctantly agrees to protect him for a large payday. As Strachey does a half-hearted investigation, he's shocked when he learns that Rutka really was murdered, and even more dismayed, when he sees that the local police department, really doesn't care all that much. I know I'm going to get more than few e-mails about this, but it has to be said. I have no problem with a gay detective working within the gay community, in fact, I think it's a great twist in the classic mystery genre. That being said, the movie features a gay actor, on a gay network, married to a man. There are men kissing, there are male strippers, and there is bigotry all around them, so why is it necessary to constantly refer to the elephant in the room? The film goes out of it's way to mention the word gay and throw in a joke or comment whenever possible, and it was so over the top that it actually takes away from the seriousness of the film. The setting and characters are simply parts of a larger story and the focus should really have been more about the mystery in front of them and less about the sexual orientation of the characters. Third Man Out features a great twist in a classic who-done-it story, the acting is solid, the writing is terrific, and once it gets going, it's a very compelling story. I just wish that they had cut out some of the unnecessary satire, and stuck more to the story. There are three more films out there though, and hopefully filmmakers learned from their mistakes and let the next mystery speak for itself.",1438992000,,2175,4.565217391304348
