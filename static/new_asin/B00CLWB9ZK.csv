8583208,5,B00CLWB9ZK,"Rhea Topping has a very good video for a beginner.  It has the basics and enough drills that you should be able to learn to double haul.  It's easier if you find someone who knows how and have them help you learn.  Watch the video and get some real person help.  Remember it's 5% instructor and 95% student.  Do your part.  I was disappointed there wasn't more advanced information.  I've been using a fly rod for 35 years and the video probably won't be much help for someone who's been hauling for a few years.  That shouldn't keep a beginner from buying the video and practicing the double haul.  I really did like that several times it was pointed out that the haul helps balance out the cast and make it easier to cast.  You will be less tired and you can fish more hours if you double haul efficiently and at a reasonable rate.  It may help a little on distance but it's not a magic cure for a poor cast.  It won't make your 50 ft cast zing out to 75 or 80 ft.  For most people, once you start to double haul it becomes a very easy and natural thing to do and you may haul on almost every cast.  It's 5 stars for a beginner and 3 stars for someone who already knows how to double haul.",1405468800,,1191,4.0995670995671
