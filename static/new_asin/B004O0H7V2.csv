8436901,5,B004O0H7V2,My daughter had this at her church last year for VBS. By the second day every child in the room knew every song with the hand motions. It was truly a beautiful sight to see that many children enjoying being at church that much. I loved it so much I bought the cd that day. I have since given the cd as a gift to my parents to sing on stage with their adult service. I would definately recommend this!!,1329350400,4,401,4.025
8436902,5,B004O0H7V2,"This is possibly the best VBS DVD we have ever used . All the kids from pre schoolers to teens loved it . Older adults enjoyed it as well .
The signs were simple and easy to learn , the songs were mostly one verse and chorus , making for less to memorize . The production quality was first rate .
We will continue to use it for Sunday School opening worship as a prelude to our live music . I highly recommend Pandamania for your VBS .",1313971200,3,435,3.9545454545454546
