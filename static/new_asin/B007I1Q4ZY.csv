5088368,5,B007I1Q4ZY,"Well, my experience about this wrestling DVD. It was fantastic and I indeed loved it. It was the bomb and I am a die-hard fan. Thank you very much, yours, Zaida Quijano.",1344384000,,169,4.3125
5088369,4,B007I1Q4ZY,"""People Power"" Battle Royal - United States Champion Santino Marella & Intercontinental Champion Cody Rhodes were sitting at ringside as the winner of this match would get to choose which champion he would challenge later that night.  Christian made his return to WWE here as this battle royal had some moments such as Yoshi Tatsu taking a real bad fall, Miz & Alex Riley facing off, Tyson Kidd making the best of the spotlight he had on him, and the moments with the final three.  This was entertaining & good way to kick off the show.

WWE Tag Team Champions Kofi Kingston & R-Truth vs. Dolph Ziggler & Jack Swagger - This was textbook Tag Team Wrestling 101 as it started off with both teams trading momentum in the first half of the match before Swagger & Ziggler cut off Truth from Kofi & worked him over building to the hot tag to Kingston.  A good match as you saw all four men did work hard here with good storytelling but the match was hurt by the commentary as Lawler was more focused on talking about Vickie Guerrero's naval than anything else.

WWE Divas Champion Layla vs. Beth Phoenix - Beth was out to get the woman who she feels took her title shot at the previous PPV in Layla and should be noted that the crowd was chanting ""We Want Kharma"" before the match.  Layla was able to counter a slam attempt with a head scissors followed by a crossbody from the corner early before Beth focused on the knee using the ringpost & ropes to wrap it around while stretching it with moves like the half crab before Layla fought back countering a body press attempt into a spike DDT & rolling through the Glam Slam before giving a Beth a ""Rude Awakening.""  There were some moments here where you saw their timing was slightly off but still a good match from the divas.

World Champion Sheamus vs. Randy Orton vs. Chris Jericho vs. Alberto Del Rio - Orton & Sheamus had unfinished business from their match on SmackDown days earlier so they took out the heels early to focus on each other but Jericho & Del Rio decided to work together as a team focusing on Sheamus' injured shoulder but the alliance didn't last long when it one man broke up the others pinfall attempt.  Sheamus was kept on the outside & out of action by everyone at one point while each man at one point as able to have a counter to a signature move like RKO countered into a cross armbreaker, exchanges of counters between the RKO & Brouge Kick, another RKO attempt into the codebreaker, and armbreaker into the Walls Of Jericho.  Michael Cole described this match perfectly, ""Action Was Insane & All Over The Place"" as this was a great fatal four way match where everyone had a moment where it looked like they were capable of winning the championship.

Brodus Clay vs. The Miz - Outside of The Miz doing his own version of Brodus' dancing (which nobody picked up that he was was actually doing the dance from the Michael Jackson's video ""Thriller""), this was the typical Brodus performance but I'll give Miz credit that just like Dolph the previous PPV, he gave him the most competition than we usually get from his challengers.

Intercontinental Champion Cody Rhodes vs. Christian - Christian had chosen to face Santino for his title after the battle royal but after overhearing Cody make comments backstage, Christian changed his mind & challenged Cody instead.  Christian went into the steps on the outside at one point before Rhodes worked over Christian's previously injured shoulder & even executed a beautiful moonsault at one point but it was when Cody lost his cool that Christian was able to not only take advantage but also take to this air himself.  This was just an average match as it just seemed to be missing something as the chemistry was a big off but the bigger picture here & throughout the night was Christian's return & making an impact.

WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. Daniel Bryan - As Punk alluded to in the pre-match interview, the two former Ring Of Honor competitors meet here for the WWE Championship which would have been unthinkable years ago.  The crowd was split from the very start as Punk focused on Bryan's leg wrapping it in the ropes before working it over with various stomps & kicks & kneedrops & a curb stomp with his legs wrapped up along with submissions like an indian deathlock & spinning toehold while later tossing him over the top rope to the floor landing knee first.  Bryan showed the effects of Punk's offense after delivering a missile dropkick but hurt his own leg in the process as he focused on the midsection that Kane had hurt with a steel chair on the previous SmackDown doing such thing as dropping him on the guardrail, various stretches, a running kneedrop, and the flying headbutt before both men crash & burned on each other with dual crossbody attempts.  Both men continued to target each others focal points of the body from here with Bryan's kicks to Punk's ribs, Punk's dragonscrew legwhip & figure four before dropping his Savage elbow but hurting his own ribs in the process, and Bryan being able to counter Punk's trademark bulldog into the Yes Lock.  This was a hell of a match that stole the show as the two men who are more known for being wrestlers than entertains gave you exactly what you would expect from them.

Ryback vs. Camacho - Outside of Lilian Garcia once again making a mistake by announcing that Hunico was wrestling this match, this was the typical Ryback squash you expect which of course got the chants by fans of another guy who used to ""jackhammer"" his way through the competition.

No Disqualification/No CountOut Match: John Cena vs. John Laurinatitis - As made clear on the previous RAW, anyone who interfered in this match would be fired while Laurinatits had to win this match or else he would be fired as well & before the match got started, pay attention to Michael Cole's comments about the Dynamic Dudes because I couldn't help but laugh hard at that one.  This match was all about John Cena embarrising & having fun at Laurinatitis' expense from doing the old school airplane spin, using the announce table including doing spanish commentary (well, sorta), having ""shrinkage"", taking out the trash, using a chair, and of course using the fire extinguisher.  However after what happened on the previous RAW, a disgruntled ex-employee got involved & delivered the final ""knockout"" blow that changed the entire face of the match.  Let's be honest in that we've seen this type of match up with the wrestler against non-wrestler authority figure before with guys like Austin & Rock & Ric Flair going against people like Mr. McMahon & Shane McMahon & Eric Bischoff so I won't knock the concept of this match but Cena just wasn't as entertaining as the babyface here as I found most of his rumor corny & unfunny while I'll give credit to Laurinatitis in that he did his role well in taking the beating while also doing some funny bumps & comedic moments as well the best he could (sue me, I laughed when he imitated Booker T).  Bottom line, if you like John Cena's type of humor then you'll like this match despite the ending which was really very predictable based off the stipulations & what happened earlier in the week on RAW.

In the end, this PPV didn't surpass WrestleMania or Extreme Rules but was a nice follow up as the only things I can really saw were a negative here where the two last minute Brodus/Ryback matches that were the exact same stuff we see on TV every week, Rhodes/Christian just seemed off while the main event while again I just didn't care for the Cena/Laurinatitis match.  Everything else on the card was great as you saw the talent worked hard & gave good performances with the highlight of the night being the Punk/Bryan match while Christian returned to get a bigger push in one night than he had for months before getting injured.  It's not a show I would go out of my way to get but definitely something I would check out for a viewing.",1338249600,,7937,4.598018400566171
5088370,4,B007I1Q4ZY,"Tonight Sheamus faces 3 other competitors looking to capture the World Title, CM Punk faces former friend Daniel Bryan for the WWE Title and can John Cena defeat Raw and Smackdown General Manager John Laurenitis and send Big Johnny to the unemployment line? Its time for WWE's Over The Limit.

-People Power Battle Royal, Winner Faces Either the Intercontinental or United States Champion Later in the PPV: As the show comes on the air the match is already in progress and among them is the returning Christian. Its not too bad, it does feature a lot of jobbers like Tyler Reks, Curt Hawkins, the Usos though Miz is among the superstars included. One elimination of note is when Titus O'Neill, Darren Young and Miz get rid of The Great Khali, the crowd cheers big for William Regal but he gets eliminated which the fans boo. Its down Christian, Miz and David Otunga who double team Christian, but Otunga gets tossed out. Miz and Christian battle and Christian hits a spear knocking Miz off the apron to the floor. 6/10. He then motions to Santino Marella so it will be Christian vs. Santino for the U.S Title later tonight.

-WWE Tag Team Championship Match, R-Truth & Kofi Kingston (Champions) vs. Jack Swagger & Dolph Ziggler: Here's a good tag match that features the usual good double teaming, Truth and Kofi hit some good high flying offense, Dolph and Jack do display good amateur skills and ground both men. They cut the ring off and wear down Kofi for a few before the hot tag is made to Truth, who hits a nice corkscrew elbow on Jack but a distraction allows him to hit a running Vader Bomb for two. Truth gets worked over before tagging Kofi who hits the expected jumping clotheslines and kicks including the Boom Drop on Ziggler. The closing minutes are gold as both teams prevent the 3 count, Truth hits a dive on Swagger on the outside, Kofi hits Trouble In Paradise and covers Dolph to retain the titles. 6/10.

-Backstage David Otunga and Eve are talking to Curt Hawkins and Tyler Reks about going into the crowd and removing any anti-Laurenitis signs.

-WWE Diva's Championship Match, Layla (Champion) vs. Beth Phoenix: Last month Layla returned at Extreme Rules and won the Diva's title and Beth was out to regain the belt. Layla starts out with some quick moves but Beth shows her strength and stomps down the champ for a bit, the crowd starts a ""We Want Kharma"" chant and really doesn't seem to care one bit about the match. Beth starts targeting the knee, wrapping it around the ring post, Layla counters a press slam into a DDT for two and the crowd boos. After kicking out of a roll-up, Layla hits a neckbreaker out of nowhere and covers to retain the title. 3/10, mainly cause the crowd just didn't care.

-Matt Striker is backstage with Chris Jericho and Randy Orton, where Chris talks about how he will become a World Champion for the seventh time. Randy says if he gets in his way he'll get an RKO.

-Fatal Four Way Match for the World Heavyweight Championship, Sheamus (Champion) vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. Randy Orton vs. Chris Jericho: Coming into the match each of these guys had run-ins and matches with each other and the 3 challengers each wanted to lay claim to the title. During Del Rio's entrance the crowd starts a ""Si, Si, Si"" chant and for the third straight PPV Sheamus gets a large amount of booing. Like most fatal four ways this has the pairing off and also unexpected double teaming as each man looked to gain the advantage and sneak in a quick pinfall. Everyone gets some good spots in and the pace rarely slows down, even during the expected submission holds, Del Rio and Sheamus have a good match in a match, then Jericho and Orton square off.

Del Rio comes in and locks on the Cross Arm Breaker but Jericho breaks it up, the pace really picks up as each goes for their finisher. Nice spot where Orton hits the DDT off the second rope on Alberto and Ricardo, Jericho counters the arm breaker into the Walls, then hits a Codebreaker on Sheamus but only for two. Orton is in hits an RKO on Chris then Alberto, gets the Brogue Kick, Sheamus then hits White Noise on Jericho and covers him to retain the title. 8/10.

-Cody Rhodes is backstage with Eve, where Rhodes says Christian made the wise choice to face Santino instead of himself as Christian wouldn't have been able to beat him. Christian appears behind Cody and says he changed his mind and he'll face Rhodes instead.

-The Miz vs. Brodus Clay: Miz comes out and tries doing some dancing of his own but gets cut off by Brodus's music, its the usual Brodus match he uses his strength but Miz does hit some good moves and sends Clay into the ring post. Miz does hit a couple of nice double axe handles off the top rope, but Brodus comes back with his usual moves however does hit a nice throw off the top then the splash and covers to win. 4/10.

-Hawkins and Reks are in the crowd taking anti-Laurenitis signs from ""fans"" aka plants in the audience.

-WWE Intercontinental Championship Match, Cody Rhodes (Champion) vs. Christian: Cody cuts a promo on the fans especially North Carolina even referencing his dad Dusty Rhodes, the crowd cheers for Christian whose now a good guy for some reason. The match isn't bad though is kept short given how Christian already had wrestled in the opening match, Cody works over Christian keeping him down even hitting a nice superplex off the top. Once Christian makes his comeback the pace picks up, Cody does hit a nice moonsault but only for two. As Rhodes is bad mouthing Christian he gets sent into the post, Christian hits the Killswitch and covers to win the title. 6/10.

-Josh Matthews is interviewing CM Punk where he talks about how he's known Daniel Bryan for years and that he's changed for the worse. AJ appears and says that this match will be a lot of fun to watch and Punk looks at her and walks off stunned.

-WWE Championship Match, CM Punk (Champion) vs. Daniel Bryan: For years they fought on the independent circuit and into Ring of Honor and now to one of the main events of a WWE PPV. The crowd cheers both men and the usual ""Yes, Yes, Yes"" chants follow Bryan, along with ""CM Punk chants. It starts with good wrestling by both men as the crowd is split in their chants, both use good kicks and some submission moves as Punk works over the left knee of Bryan. However soon Daniel locks on a shoulder stretch working on the arm and midsection of Punk, then a surfboard but Punk comes back with hammer fists.

Punk makes a comeback but Bryan thwarts it and hits a nice flying headbutt then locks on a modified camel clutch, Punk starts battling back and the crowd is once again split on the chants. Both guys keep going all out, Punk locks on a figure four but Bryan gets to the ropes, Daniel keeps up the attack and neither man will stay down. The crowd starts a ""This is Awesome"" chant, after a big diving elbow by Punk there's a ""Randy Savage"" chant. Bryan catches Punk off the running bulldog and locks on the Yes Lock, but Punk rolls him onto his shoulders for three just as Punk was tapping out, but Punk retains the title. 10/10.

-Eve and Otunga are backstage they run into Teddy Long, who says he's looking foward to tonight's main event, then with a water bottle in hand he needs to make sure Laurenitis he has enough protein for his match. Kinda odd end to the segment.

-Camacho w/Hunico vs. Ryback: If you've seen the last couple of months of Smackdown then you know what to expect here, though why WWE felt the need to zoom the camera up to an inch from Ryback's face I'll never know. Ryback throws around Camacho, behind the referee's back Hunico hits a kick to the back of Ryback's head, then Camacho knocks him off his feet. Then we get Ryback's usual moves including a muscle buster type move and covers to win. 2/10.

-John Laurenitis vs. John Cena, If Laurenitis Loses Then He is Fired: For weeks Laurenitis had targeted John Cena blaming him for Brock Lesnar leaving the WWE and proceeded to make Cena's life very difficult, which led to this match where no one could interfere or they and Laurenitis would be fired on the spot and you could only win by pinfall or submission. Its mostly a comedy match, Cena does an airplane spin and Johnny falls out of the ring, Cena brings out the ring bell and rings it by Johnny's ear a couple of times. Back in the ring Johnny tries for a handshake but Cena slams him, goes for a mic then says he's gonna put him in the STF and says he'll let go if he can last 10 seconds, this goes on for a bit with Cena even taking a water break.

Cena pours water on him then down his pants, then sprays a fire exstinguisher on him for a few seconds, pours a trash can on him on the outside. Shockingly Laurenitis wrenchs Cena's bad arm then targets it with a steel chair, but Cena grabs the chair and does the Five Knuckle Shuffle with it, but Johnny hits a lowblow. Laurenitis goes to escape through the crowd, in the ring Cena looks confused, the recently ""fired"" Big Show comes out with Laurenitis in his grasp then brings him in the ring. Now Johnny is between both Cena and Show, Laurenitis pleads with Show, Cena goes for the AA and Show hits the Knockout Punch and stands in the corner. Johnny covers Cena and pins him. 5/10. Show helps Laurenitis up then leaves the ring.

Not a bad PPV, the title matches save this show and the vast majority of the other matches aren't too bad with only the squash and Diva's matches being the downers.",1337558400,3,9453,4.466396292004635
5088371,5,B007I1Q4ZY,"The People Power battle royal was a pretty good for a opener and it got really intense in the end. The Tag Team title match between the team of Dolph Ziggler & Jack Swagger against the team of Kofi Kingston & R-Truth was a solid tag bout to say the least. The Divas title match between Beth Phoenix & Layla was not great but pretty good. The Fatal Four Way Match for the World's title(Sheamus vs Alberto Del Rio vs Randy Orton vs Chris Jericho) was hard-hitting,smash-mouth,action-packed bout. The match between Brodus Clay & The Miz was mediocre at best and the same goes for the Camacho-Ryback match. The IC title match Cody Rhodes-Christan was a pretty good back-and-forth bout. The WWE title match between CM Punk & Daniel Bryan was a back-and-forth,submission-driven,hard-hitting,nail-biting bout. The Anything Goes match between John Cena & John Laurinaitis was dumb,cartoony,dragging waste of time but what kept me from hating this to the max is Big Show's double-cross on Cena. That loss oughta make WWE turn John Cena a heel now. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1337472000,2,1069,4.783783783783784

OVER THE LIMIT 2012

1.[PEOPLE POWER BATTLE ROYAL]-the night opens with a battle royal in which the winner gets a shot at the I-C or U.S. title, which ever they want. Of course like any battle royal it is fun and fast paced. These are always favorites of mine so you know I loved it. The returning Christian gets the job done here and gets a title shot later in the night.

2.[TAG TTILES]R-TRUTH & KOFI KINGSTON VS DOLPH ZIGGLER & JACK SWAGGER-we follow that up with a great tag match in which both teams look wonderful. Of course we get the back and forth momentum changes and the heels cutting one guy off from another to build the hot tag. This match is full of action and proves how good each of these guys are. Truth and Kofi keep the belts in a great tag match.

3.[DIVAS TITLE]LAYLA VS BETH PHOENIX-this was a pretty good Divas match with some nice counters and near falls. The action moves at a good pace and both women do a good job. Layla retains in a good effort from both women, I miss them.

4.[WORLD TITLE]SHEAMUS VS RANDY ORTON VS CHRIS JERICHO VS ALBERTO DEL RIO-this was an excellent fatal four way match with four of the top guys. Of course alliances are throughout the match only to fall apart since it is every man for himself. There are various near finishes in the match with fast and furious action. Every man seems like they have the match won at various points but in the end Sheamus retains the title.

5. THE MIZ VS BRODUS CLAY-this is one of those filler matches that isn't bad but isn't really PPV worthy either. Miz pulls off some Thriller moves in this match for us while Clay uses his size to his advantage. Decent match with Miz doing most of the work here, also I do enjoy the ladies at ringside here.

6.[I-C TITLE]CODY RHODES VS CHRISTIAN-when Christian won the battle royal earlier he had the choice of U.S or C title to go for. At first it seemed he would go for the U.S. title but after Cody a little cocky backstage he decided to go for the I-C title. This was a good match with the crowd all the way behind Christian in his return singles match. Of course Cody didn't help that with his promo earlier before the match which was great. Good match here that flows at a nice pace with Christian coming out on top with the title in hand.

7.[WWE TITLE]CM PUNK VS DANIEL BRYAN-why this wasn't the main event is beyond me as it stole the show. These two put on an amazing performance and I still cant see why Vince didn't let this go on last. This was a great back and forth match full of everything you would expect from these two. They are the two best in the game right now [or at least when Punk returns] and deliver every time, especially against each other. This is easily the best match on the card with pure wrestling, wrestling, it had to be said twice. The finish with Punk winning is great, I love the way they played it here.

8. RYBACK VS CAMACHO-this was one of those squash match for Ryback when he was still undefeated. He pretty much runs through Camacho here for the easy win.

9.[NO DQ/COUNTOUT MATCH]JOHN CENA VS JOHN LAURINATITS-now earlier I stated wrestling twice in the Punk/Bryan match because here it was all about the entertainment. This was all about Cena beating Johnny Ace all over the place. It was entertaining and there were some hilarious moments on commentary here. But after Cena beat him down the whole time Ace got in a few hits and then finally escaped. He was promptly brought back by The Big Show who he had previously fired. Things went south after that though as Show knocked out Cena and helped Ace win the match and save his job.

This was a good event over all with some great matches especially that Punk/Bryan match. As a special feature we get an interview with Sheamus with the great Matt Striker.",1402358400,,3786,4.365056818181818

1. Battle Royal to determine who will have a shot at the IC title or US title later in the show:
This was a fun opener. The crowd seemed to be into it with a bunch of Regal chants and everyone loved the return of Christian. It's funny how he was a heel, leaves, cameback and now he's a face. Winner was predictable but still a good match
7/10

2. WWE TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: Kofi Kingston and R-Truth(c) vs. Jack Swagger and Dolph Ziggler:  This match started out ok but felt a little slow in the middle with a really cool finish that will make you want to see more out of this four guys.
6/10 (for the finish)

3. DIVAS CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: Layla(c) vs. Beth Phoenix:
For a diva's match this was actually pretty good! I was actually enjoying this two wrestle because that's what they actually did! Reminds me of TNA's knockout's!

4. FATAL 4-WAY MATCH FOR THE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP: Sheamus(c) vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. Chris Jericho vs. Randy Orton:
This was a really enjoyable match! All 4 of these guys work really well together and this match proves it. It's just some good classic entertainment with really fun false finishes.

5/10

6. INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: Cody Rhodes vs. Christian:
This was a great match. The crowd loved it. It was just a way to show who the next World champions are. This match starts out with an excellent promo by Cody Rhodes making fun of people in North Carolina.
7/10

7. WWE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: CM Punk(c) vs. Daniel Bryan: WOW! This two know how to put on a show! They know how to show technique which seems to be a lost art in WWE. These guys just put on one heck of a show. I don't agree with the finish because the man who is pinned has his shoulders up which ruined this match from becoming match of the year. Anyways an excellent match buy the DVD for this!
