8603346,4,B00EASFSFK,"This box set contains 3 previously released operas in their original DVD cases, housed in a thin cardboard box. All operas are available on Amazon individually.

THE OPERAS ARE:

LA TRAVIATA (3.0 stars)  2003
Mireille Delunsch is Violetta Valry. Matthew Polenzani is Alfredo Germont. Zeljko Lucic is Giorgio Germont. Yutaka Sado conducts the Orchestre de Paris at the Festival D'Aix en-Provence. Singing ranges from decent to excellent. Acting is excellent. There is no scenery; the only prop is a chair. Costumes are slightly bizarre. Lights are flashed at the stage to create effects. Delunsch gives an impressive performance.

AIDA (4.8 stars)  2006
Nina Stemme is Aida. Salvatore Licitra is Radams. Luciana D'Intino is Amneris. Adam Fischer conducts the Zurich Opera Orchestra. Excellent singing and acting. This production is updated to the time that Verdi composed it, which slightly distracts from the plot. Scenery is beautiful. Occasionally the screen is split into three boxes. A few times this enhances the storytelling but it is mostly a distraction.

MACBETH (3.0 stars)  2009
Dimitris Tiliakos is Macbeth. Violeta Urmana is Lady Macbeth. Ferruccio Furlanetto is Banco. Teodor Currentzis conducts the Paris Opera Orchestra. Excellent singing and acting. Very poor stage directing. This production is set around mid-20th century. The witches appear as the local community dressed in everyday clothes; the Scottish refugees at the border look like witches. The ghost of Banco munches potato chips.
