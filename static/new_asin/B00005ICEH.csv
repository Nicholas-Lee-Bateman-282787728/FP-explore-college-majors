1425901,5,B00005ICEH,"We love Kipper! Our son has been watching his videos since he was 2 and he's almost 7 now. They are funny, engaging, interesting and mellow without being boring. If you're tired of the hyper, loud, inappropriate video trash that's out there for kids, you'll love Kipper.",1171065600,7,270,4.76595744680851
1425902,5,B00005ICEH,"I wish these would come out on DVD, I hate the rewinding with tape, but these episodes are great like all Kipper episodes.  The shows are gentle, and don't rub lessons in your face.  For e.g. the river trip has a section where Tiger is to tie up the boat.
There is never a loud voice and I love watching along with my 2 year old son through as many repeats as he would like.  Can  you believe, he prefers it to Barney!  I think that is because of the simple engaging story lines.  You can let them watch on their own without a worry unlike shows like Sesame street.  In the official reviews comparison to Pooh, I would mention that there is no destructive, loud, inconsiderate character like the Tigger in the newer disney pooh shows here.",1027036800,6,739,4.311594202898551
1425903,5,B00005ICEH,"I have the first Kipper video's Pig's Present and The Visitor, which was my introduction to Kipper since we do not get cable. Anyway I thought the older ones were really good, but nothing compared to the new ones- this video and Pools, Parks and Picnics. Now Kipper has a background. When camping there are tress and lakes and not just the white background of the older videos. These stories are wonderful and edge of your seat fun- for me anyway. My baby is 9 month's old and can sit through 2 Tiger Tales. I kept watching the whole 60 minute video because I could not turn it off. Kipper, Tiger and friends go camping, roller skating, to the beach, and river rafting in this one. All the episodes are wonderful, cute, fun and even learning. You teach your children to play outside and share. There is no inside the house, or in this case doghouse, in this video. I loved it and I hope Sara will to when she gets a little older.",992908800,11,929,4.344827586206897

1425936,5,B00005ICEH,Kipper is my daughter's favorite.  I am so glad that Amazon has kept Kipper as part of their Amazon Prime.  Thanks!,1402358400,,115,4.428571428571429
1425937,5,B00005ICEH,My son loves kipper!! great stories and keeps him entertained while other shows he can become easily distracted with kipper he is watching the whole time.,1401753600,,154,4.961538461538462
1425938,5,B00005ICEH,"My son adores Kipper (he is 3). It is his go-to cartoon right now, and has been for a few months. I actually really enjoy Kipper as well. It is simple, quiet, and clever, and sweet. I enjoy that my son now speaks in British-English: ""Ready, steady, Go!"" ""I would like a biscuit."" ""Let's have a go!"" And he says all their names with an accent. It's pretty funny. This is one that I don't mind letting him watch over and over, and I have only gotten mildly bored with it after the 700th viewing, lol.",1398816000,,498,4.197916666666667

1425940,5,B00005ICEH,"My daughter LOVES LOVES LOVES this show, so glad that it's now on Amazon because they stopped casting it on Netflix...Would have been so bad if I didn't find it on Amazon. My girl is hooked!!!",1397347200,,192,4.361111111111111
1425941,5,B00005ICEH,"Kipper was on TV in the late 90s and my youngest son, who was about 8 years of age, really loved this show!  There is a lot of programs and music for children that I think is worthless and trashy!  Kipper is one exception! The stories are low key, sweet and innocent!  The jazz music is good and not obnoxious like some videos.  Smaller children probably won't understand the English accents when they are young but will come to understand it as they grow older.  I still have a working VCR at home so I can show these to my grand daughter!  Thank you England for Kipper and his friends!",1395705600,,587,4.290909090909091
1425942,4,B00005ICEH,"Kipper offers my "" grandchild"" a non - aggressive yet common emotion to a number of everyday type(s) of situations. Kipper even offers a"" thought process"" while working through a given situation. Will done BBC !!

1425953,5,B00005ICEH,My son is almost 3 and loves all of the Kipper shows. They are just so sweet and simple. Great dialogue and the cartoon is never too flashy. Some stories are very imaginative while others are more simple.,1392768000,,204,4.394736842105263
1425954,5,B00005ICEH,"I personally haven't watched the entire episode, but I limit very much what my four-year old son watches and this is one of three shows that he watches. He can watch it over and over again. It's cute, funny and appropriate for his age. Many children's cartoons have a ""bad guy"" element which frightens him so I make sure to find shows that are just pure fun and entertaining and easy to understand.",1392681600,,398,4.465753424657534
1425955,5,B00005ICEH,"very well made animation. Perfect for kids and adults. no bad language, story lines are awesome. We all love the whole series of kipper. I wish there were more.",1391558400,,160,4.551724137931035
1425956,5,B00005ICEH,"Kipper is great. Very relaxed, easy for kids to follow. It can also be entertaining for adults. The books are excellent as well.",1391472000,2,128,4.608695652173913
1425957,5,B00005ICEH,"Many of us know that Kipper entertains our young cares, but also shares educational stories in a subtle way. You can have several popular epesodes all in one easy to access location. I raised 3 sets of children over the last 34 years, and now often care for the grand children. Although TV Media should be used in a wise and delegated manner, Kipper has enough class to rise above the other often questionable variety.",1389139200,,418,4.586666666666667
1425958,5,B00005ICEH,Calm and thoughtful programming for little ones.  How do you do humor for 2 yrs olds?  Mick Inkpen does it!,1387497600,,107,4.3
1425959,3,B00005ICEH,I enjoy the Kipper Tales because my grandson who has autism love to watch them on my kindle when his family comes over which he like to be next to me and sit in his comfort space,1386547200,,178,3.8378378378378377

1425961,5,B00005ICEH,"Sweet, simple little cartoon with nice animals and good stories. Beats so much of what is out there. And my 3.5 yo daughter loves it.",1385510400,,133,4.36
1425962,5,B00005ICEH,Daughter loves it and it's safe! I don't have to worry about what she's watching! My daughter is generally pretty serious but this show has her cracking up (she's 2 1/2).,1380585600,,170,4.516129032258065
1425973,4,B00005ICEH,kids needed a break they love kipper. would like some ability to change language though. the download in ecuador took the time of the movie. i think its by landline connection.,1372204800,,176,4.709677419354839
1425974,4,B00005ICEH,My friend's kids whom i downloaded this for love it and watched it over and over. even the 6 year old,1371686400,,101,3.857142857142857
1425975,4,B00005ICEH,"Fine for the kid to watch. Just a little sleepy for me, with the muted colors and British accents. But very innocent and sweet.",1368144000,,127,4.333333333333333
1425976,5,B00005ICEH,I love Kipper myself and it's one of the few shows I actually let my kids watch. So glad that Prime offers plenty of English programming.,1367452800,,137,4.3076923076923075

1425978,5,B00005ICEH,"I absolutely love Kipper.  I bought all that were available on Amazon.  Kipper is calming but fun and doesn't create that ""bouncing off the walls"" reaction in my family who all watch it.  Even if no one else in my family enjoyed these videos (which they do) I would still watch them myself!",1267574400,,290,4.433962264150943
1425979,5,B00005ICEH,"We own every Kipper DVD ever made.  As a amateur cartoonist myself I have to say that this is the best animation for children you'll EVER find.  These people are genius'!!  I love to watch them over and over with my grand daughter.
Buy one and you'll want them all!",1266537600,,265,4.26
1425980,5,B00005ICEH,We love anything Kipper.  This is a wholesome video series with good values in a simple format that really focuses on a lesson.  We love Kipper.  It is so cute how my US child has picked up on the British vernacular.  These videos are appropriate for the toddler in their simplistic art styles but extend into Kindergarten age in the dialog and life lessons.  Did I say we love Kipper!,1226102400,3,385,4.442857142857143

1425982,5,B00005ICEH,"I am so happy to have discovered Kipper! This was the first video we got, but have added many more!
In a time of banal, ugly, frenetic children's entertainment, Kipper is a gift! A nice pace, cute stories, lovable characters, what else can I say? My child loves the English accents and imitates Kipper and Tiger very well!
This is still my favorite video, but all of the Kipper's are great!",1207353600,5,390,4.507042253521127

This compilation of Tiger Tales is extra delightful, as we all know someone like Tiger, and love them in spite of themselves, smile. Seeing how Kipper and the rest interact with Tiger is a good lesson for us all. Ah, vanity!",1425686400,4,481,4.738095238095238
