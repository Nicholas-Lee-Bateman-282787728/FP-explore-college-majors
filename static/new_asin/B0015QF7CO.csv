8259535,5,B0015QF7CO,"My grandchildren love these DVD's and watch 5 or 6 DVD's at one sitting.  There are 8 DVD's in the package with 2 animated shows on each lasting around 15 minutes--16 stories in all encouraging good character--patience, faith, loyalty, honesty, goodness, kindness, gentleness, obedience, self control, responsibility, thankfulness, peace, joy, politeness, patience, and confidence. Each story has two songs about the theme and a story of how to behave with character. Altogether excellent and godly.",1422835200,3,499,5.653333333333333
