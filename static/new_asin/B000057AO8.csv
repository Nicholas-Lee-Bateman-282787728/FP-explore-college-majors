About four years ago, I did find one of those rentals on eBay, and I paid about 15.00 for it (not a bad deal). It's okay, I guess...at least I get to see the show again, but WHEN will this come out on DVD?",1247443200,,379,3.871794871794872
7932925,5,B000057AO8,"I have followed Eurythmics since their inception way back in 1983. I've been to their concerts and were in awe of them. Their music and videos always broke the mold in terms of innovation and creativity. The voice of Annie Lennox is incomparable. It is unique in range and sound. One just has to hear a note to know that it is Annie. Dave Stewart is probably one of the most underated guitarists around. Whether he is playing acoustic or electric, his masterful interpretations rank him among the best.

I lost track of Eurythmics in the 90's after they went their separate ways. I loved Annie Lennox's solo albums, most notably Diva.

I happened to come across YouTube and a live concert video of Sex Crime (1984). This one video brought about in me a rediscovering of Eurythmics. When I viewed other songs from this live concert I knew I had to have it. It is, IMHO, one of the best concerts I have ever seen on video. From the moment Annie steps on the stage to perform Sex Crime, the viewer is hooked. Annie and Dave really seemed to enjoy doing this concert not only for themselves but for their fans. They ran the gamut in terms of songs from ""Whose That Girl"" to ""Missionary Man"" I particularly enjoyed ""It's Alright (Baby's Coming Back)and ""Here Comes The Rain Again""

Eurythmics band members are simply awesome led by harmonica and sax player Jimmy Zavala and Blondie drummer Clem Burke. Accompanying vocalist Joniece Jamison is amazing. What a powerful voice she has.

Rumor has it that this concert, along with Savage and We Too Are One will be made into DVD. I hope so. This concert deserves to be heard and seen in the dvd format to really appreciate it. Eurythmics are still around today because people know genius when they hear it. They continue to win awards to this day and for a good reason. They simply are THE BEST!!!",1166918400,4,1838,4.5606060606060606
