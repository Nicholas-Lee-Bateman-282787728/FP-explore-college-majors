 Most Dressage DVD focus on correcting the horse. Walter Zettl gentlely helps the rider make the corrections they need to their aides to help the horse find balance.

It is frequnently the rider who creates the problem with their inappropriate or unintentional aides. Mastering your own balance, body, hand, and legs must come first. Walter Zettl's directions are precise and he clearly describes what action the rider needs to take and the anticipated response the horse should have.

True learning only comes in the frequent transitions Walter Zettl uses to teach his students. This is what sets A Matter of Trust apart from the typical equine DVD.  Cantering or trotting around an arena without transitions does not give the rider and horse any opportunity to improve in the different gaits it only build endurance. It is difficult to imagine how  a horse and rider will develop finese at the canter or trot when there are major problems at a walk.

Walter Zettl will help every rider and horse from Olympic arena to country trail find their true potential.

A Matter of Trust should be required viewing for all riders regardless of their riding disciple.
The moment of learning for horse and rider comes in the transitions. Doing endless laps arounds the arena creates endurance but does not improve the quality of the gaits.",1408492800,3,1398,4.919148936170213
