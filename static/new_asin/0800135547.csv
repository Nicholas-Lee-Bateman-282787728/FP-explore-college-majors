168944,5,0800135547,"MIKE NICHOLS' FORGOTTEN FILM?

When Mike Nichols died last month at 83, there was an outpouring of deserved accolades for the acclaimed performer and director of films and plays (he won nine Tonys).  The river of tributes always mentions, at the very least, 1967's THE GRADUATE (for which he won a Best Director Oscar), WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOLF (1966) and the 2012 reboot on Broadway of Arthur Miller's ""THE DEATH OF A SALESMAN.""  No question, he had a golden touch and his work on stage and screen was among the best of the last 50 years.

Nichols first gained attention as half of the sensational, farcical comic duo with partner Elaine May.  Sitting on stools on a bare stage, their sly, often improvised, witty wordplay revealed a sophisticated awareness of the human condition -- especially as it pertained to the battle of the sexes.

That rarified wit was also present in Nichols' forgotten, manic, slapstick THE FORTUNE (1975).  Nichols had directed two expensive films (CATCH-22 and DAY OF THE DOLPHIN) that received mixed reviews and he wanted a hit.

Carol Eastman, the screenwriter of FIVE EASY PIECES, wrote the jazz era farce under the pen name Adrian Joyce.  But this dark, manic comedy is a not just a slapstick homage to the screwball comedies of the thirties but more a hybrid Laurel and Hardy riff on steroids.

Jack Nicholson is Oscar Sullivan and Warren Beatty is Nicky Wilson - both inept con men.  They have an insane plan to relieve madcap flapper heiress Fredericka Quintessa Bigard - a wonderful Stockard Channing in her first film role - of her fortune.

Naturally, things go horribly awry in their increasingly desperate escapade of deadly errors that involves love, betrayal, embezzlement, murder and the Mann Act.  Richard Sylbert created the terrific production design and master cinematographer John Alonzo captured the period images.  It's top-notch in every way and an unexpected, unfiltered delight from Nichols.

It's strange that this mostly unseen, but maligned film from Nichols is often put in the same category as former comedic partner May's equally unseen but wildly funny ISHTAR that got dissed before release based only on articles about it's massive budget overruns.

I was working in Hollywood when this film was made and I heard many stories about events that were said to impact production.  Nichol's wanted Bette Midler for the lead but a perceived insult from Midler changed that and the unknown Channing was given the female lead. Also, around this time, an article revealed that Nicholson's sister was his mother.  A fact he did not know.  Strong emotions from all the principals, both personal and professional were and are apparently attached to this project that deserves to be seen for the wonderfully wacky film that it is.

Nicholson never mentions this film in interviews nor can it be found in his published authorized biographical material.  THE FORTUNE barely received a theatrical release and was never officially distributed in the home video market.  Director Nichols did not direct another movie for almost a decade.  Sometimes, the weird vagaries of the public's fickle affection cannot be parsed.

But wait.  Breaking news! The demand from the cult of vocal fans, including the Coen brothers, has miraculously made this forgotten gem available in a Blu-ray transfer from Turner Classic Movies (shop.tcm.com).  Sadly, no commentary from Nicholson and Beatty.",1418774400,2,3431,5.093023255813954
168945,4,0800135547,"Why oh why is this unhinged Mike Nichols' film not on Blu-ray with an unfiltered commentary from director Nichols and stars Jack Nicholson, Stockard Channing and Warren Beatty.  In the movie, Nicholson channels Stan Laurel in a goofy homage to 1920s in this screwball, slapstick and desperate comedy of errors.  I don't think this has ever been released for home video in the U.S.",1330214400,5,380,4.921875
168946,1,0800135547,"What in the wide world of sports is going on here?  This movie is so stupid and boring, I can't believe it.  Why in the world would the only reviews here be so good?  There is no accounting for taste.  Silly, stupid, had to be a flop if ever released in movies.  I love, and I mean LOVE, Jack and Warren.  It's especially nice knowing they are good friends.  But even with all that, the movie was horrific! Spare me!  Looks like trying to remake a 20's movie, but just plain awful.  Perhaps if you have eclectic taste, or are ancient...this might appeal to you.  Not me!  This is one time I agree with the critics.  Don't bother.",1305072000,,629,4.237288135593221
168947,5,0800135547,"One of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I have waited for over a decade for this movie to come out in DVD format, but as of 2010 there still is no attempt to produce it. And I have no idea why. Beatty is spectacular as the slick talking con artist and Nicholson steals the show as his bumbling sidekick. Too many great scenes to mention, as I think of one, another will pop into my head.
 To me, this film is nearly flawless. And yet, movie studio's put Lindsy Lohan's movie on DVD? Seriously?
 I guess it's true the people who think 'Jersey Shore' is entertaining would not find this film to be something they could watch, but the rest of us who don't have to take Ritalin to be a functioning adult will.",1293235200,7,708,4.237037037037037
168948,5,0800135547,"This remains one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, with excellent performances by all three principals -- Channing, Nicholson and Beatty.  I cannot understand why it is not on DVD.  There are a lot of these really wonderful movies from the period in which this one was made which really need to be resurrected on DVD.",1262390400,2,322,4.631578947368421
168949,5,0800135547,"I've seen The Fortune at least 20 times, and I've also taped it whenever it's played on cable, but I desperately want the DVD of it (Region 1; I did purchase a Region 2 version). I think it's borderine criminal that some of the best movies ever made (such as this one and Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills) are not being released on DVD. It's also incredibly stoooooopid of the normally greedy Hollywood money men.

You want another belly full of laughs? Mixed Nuts by Nora Ephron, with a stellar cast of comedic talents! Laugh, I thought I'd die!

Add one more, The Pest, but be high on something (ice cream, sugar donuts ... whatever) when you watch it ~ it's insanely zany. If you don't need a bedpan 10 minutes into it, your humour scale is minus zero.",1235433600,3,770,4.415492957746479
168950,5,0800135547,"The Fortune was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  The acting is superb and it just gets crazier and still somehow plausible as it goes along.  Why the critics didn't like it is too bad, but then they're usually wrong anyway.  Ignore the critics, watch this wonderful film and enjoy the subtleties and humanity of real writing and acting and directing.  Sadly, there are very few films this well made -and none that I can think of today.",1196640000,5,446,4.5375

7792979,1,0800135547,"Failed 1920's set screwball comedy came out the same year as Lucky Lady and the year before Harry and Walter Go to New York--all three period comedies were complete box office and critical disasters that were likely green-lit because of the success of Paper Moon and The Sting.  The Fortune has the best pedigree of the three by virtue of its stars and director Mike Nichols but it's a painfully unfunny film that's aggressively zany without having any good comic ideas to justify the tone.

The extremely complicated set-up has Stochard Channing as a daffy heiress who runs away with Warren Beatty while marrying Jack Nicholson.  When she threatens to change her will so all of the money she inherits on her next birthday goes to charity both men decide that the only reasonable course of action is murder.

Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty and Stockard Channing are all very game but the material mostly leaves them flailing about wildly trying to give the impression that things that are happening are funny when they almost never are.  There might be three funny sight gags in the entire film and not a single amusing line--I would honestly be hard-pressed to come up with another movie that tries so hard to be funny with so little success.  Fans of Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty might want to check this out simply for curiosity value--The Fortune was so toxic that it seems to have escaped any home video release in the United States at all until very recently.

Think about how bad a movie starring Jack Nicholson and Warren Beatty would have to be to not get a home-video release for forty years then as bad as you are imagining multiply that by at least two--The Fortune is the rare kind of disaster that could only be made by talented people trying very hard and failing so spectacularly it can be hard to believe that what you are watching actually exists--it's kind of like finding out that two of the biggest stars in 1970's Hollywood made a sex tape but worse since a sex tape would almost certainly be a lot funnier.",1420156800,,2032,4.659217877094972
