485125,5,6302587948,"If you're a Dylan fan, you should see this just to watch Dylan humbled. Dylan plays an retired rock legend (Billy Parker), who gets friendly (no, nothing happens) with a young female musician...takes her to England with him to play a gig, where they meet a rock star/Parker fan (Rupert Everet). She falls for Everet, blah, blah, blah. The film is cheesy. If you can imagine a circle, with good on one point and bad at the opposite end, picture this film at the bad end...but it is so far into the bad side of the sphere it ends up on the good side. Yeah! It's really that bad. The female singer - Molly (played by Fiona) starts out with some musical integrity (she at least plays guitar) but by the end looks and sounds like Tiffany (who I vaguely remember...but I could be wrong what with being a small child in the late 80s). The Everet character (Colt) plays the classic cliche of what a male musician is - sensitive, moody, drinks to excess (I can't belive they didn't address his alcoholism), and likes to wear more make up than your average model. Oh, and the Dylan character is slightly pedophilic. Molly says she's 18 (which I don't think Fiona was) and Dylan is quite a bit older - he wants her but tries to stay away...tries to protect her but in the end I think he decides he'd like to hook up with her anyway (despite what he says to her in begining of the film). Oh, and before I forget, check out Molly's drummer...the hulking blonde...esp the scene where they get to America and he kisses the floor and shoves a groupie. I chalk this film up to Dylan messing with his image and screwing with the public...at least this funny...the victoria's secret thing just makes me sad.",1083283200,,1688,4.430868167202572
485126,2,6302587948,"Ok, to start with, yes, this movie was so funny I choked.  Like the other reviewers, I only bought it for my precious Bob.  To answer some questions you may have, no, the main character and Bob do not get it on in the hay, because she's not that smart.  No, the main character does not die a fiery death, because the producers aren't that kind.
Bob Dylan goes through the entire movie with an ""I hope you all die"" expression on his face, which is perfectly suitable considering the lines he's being forced to say.
Rupert Everett is all broody and sensitive and painfully boring in this movie and he made me want to hang myself.  The only problem is, you can only hang yourself once.
Any music in this film that doesn't come from the mouth of Bob is painfully bad, so have that remote control handy.
Would I buy it again, you ask?  Sure, if only to see Bob screw with his image yet again.",1062201600,,887,4.255952380952381
485127,4,6302587948,"...except you will need to use the fast-forward button on your remote when Bobby isn't onscreen. He performs a song called ""The Usual"" that's still in my head after only seeing it once! I heard it wasn't written by him, but I'm sure he does it justice like noone else can in this film.
Oh, and I love the little serenade in the barn at the end.=)
Another thing is I really like Fiona Flanagan's music, which of course helps when you're watching this..a cool chick.
Peace out,

485128,1,6302587948,"The Late Victor Mature once said he'd been barred from a certain club on the grounds he was an actor. Vic asked the club if they'd ever seen him act! Sadly, Bob can't (act that is) though he remains the enigmatic (musical) genius he's always been. Only highlight is a non-Dylan song-John Hiatt's ""The Usual"" which sounds like it was written for Bob!
Apart from that, the thing tanks bigtime!",1054512000,,391,4.6
485129,4,6302587948,"This movie is, quite frankly, absolutely appalling. It is also, however, possibly one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Like most of the other reviewers, I watched it simply because I'm a Dylan fan, and it's only because of the fact that I enjoyed it as much as I did. Dylan's ludicrous performance is so breathtakingly bad that it achieves a rare kind of...genius? perfection? I'm not sure how to describe it. But no matter how bad Dylan is, he is nevertheless by far the best part of this stupefyingly bad film (apart from Rupert Everett's terrifying mullet, that is). Skinny-dipping with Fiona, taunting an audience in England, punching out 'handsome' Rupert (in what is the best/worst ever punch in cinematic history - I must have rewound it 20 times) and languidly trashing a hotel room, Dylan is all over the shop, seemingly so bored he doesn't know where to look. Then, right at the end, after the blind girl pulls a gun on Rupert (don't ask) and Fiona 'rocks' her hometown (joined onstage, of course, by Dylan, who throws a cigarette at her), Bob performs a fragment of an incredibly obscure little gem, something I've never heard or heard of before and which alone justified sitting through the rest of this turgid movie. All in all, 'Hearts of Fire' is worthwhile if you're a Dylan fan, if only to see your idol brought down so low. And to have a good laugh.",998870400,,1373,4.631147540983607
485130,3,6302587948,"Bob Dylan not at his best in this movie,but still you will have to see it if you are a Dylan fan. There are some moments when Dylan will make a smile  on your face.",938908800,,164,3.6857142857142855
485131,2,6302587948,"In between the release of the inconsequential albums ""Knocked Out Loaded"" and ""Down in the Groove,"" Bob Dylan lent his  talents, or rather his name and image, to this even more inconsequential  and exceptionally silly film.  It's about as bad as the worst rock and roll  movie (such as almost anything made by Elvis from 1965-67), but worth a  look if only to hear Dylan answer a hotel employee's question, ""Would  you like flowers in your room?"" with these words:  ""Yes, I'd like  some pansies.""",927158400,,496,4.752941176470588
485132,2,6302587948,"While not as bad as most reviewers claim, it is a wasted effort.  Dylan fans will find a few gems mixed in the mess.  All and all a big disappointment despite Dylan's performance and appearances by Ritchie  Havens and Ron Wood.  Embarrassing at times.",922924800,,251,4.636363636363637

7827906,5,6302587948,I really love this movie and it is very sentimental for me and it will be for the rest of my life good thing they had a used version of it on vhs because the new one is at a  higher price maybe someone should send it to disc dvd or something.,1395878400,,242,3.6538461538461537
7827907,4,6302587948,"So, i have no idea why i purchased this. It was during mid terms and i guess i was nervous. A nervous buy ? Because I don't plan on watching it more than once. -- but regardless, it got here SO FAST. So  thank you! For being so on top of everything!",1386979200,,249,3.7884615384615383
7827908,5,6302587948,"I watched this for the same reason most people did...Because Bob Dylan was in it.
I was kind of unsure about it at first because alot of reviews said it was horrible,
but I honestly loved it. I wish they had it out on DVD, but for $2.99 you can rent it on Itunes!
Not too bad.",1371340800,,276,3.8596491228070176
7827909,5,6302587948,"I watched this movie at one in the morning after a very long day. It was comforting and funny, I liked the way Dylan's character is very caring and courteous towards Fiona's character indicating his feelings though he is very macho and she is very young. And the triangle gives force to the plot because it brings a lot of misunderstandings and you cheer for a happy ending. We just need to forget about the actors and enjoy the craziness of the music scenario at the time. And boy, what a wonderful voice that Fiona chick has... She's very hot!",1327017600,,545,4.46
7827910,4,6302587948,"As a big Dylan fan, I really enjoyed watching this film.  Yes, it's cheesy early 90's filmmaking at its worst, but it's a rare and often humorous performance by Dylan.  If you're into 80's-90's wraspy Dylan, you'll catch a few songs you might have never heard.  If you've seen some of the other rare appearances (Masked and Anon., Pat Garrett, Renaldo y Clara, Eat the Document etc.) this is a good Dylan piece to add to your collection.  If you have no interest in Dylan, or judge him because his voice isn't up your idea of American Idol standards, don't get this movie.  If you are a big fan, check it out and you'll no doubt get some enjoyment out of it.  When else will you get to see Bobby punch Rupert Everett in the face and throw a TV out the window?",1255564800,,759,4.2727272727272725
7827911,2,6302587948,"""Hearts of Fire"" shows some glimmerings throughout of what could have been a well-made story, but from the first song heard in this movie, one wonders, ""What the hell was the director THINKING???"" The first song is an extremely bad cover of Soft Cell's ""Tainted Love"" (which in the film is supposed to be an original hit by James Colt (played by Rupert Everett). I don't get why they used so many covers. Another such cover passed off as a fictional original is ""The Usual"" by John Hiatt, which is passed off as the original work of Billy Parker (Bob Dylan) in the film. The only original songs used are the ones Molly McGuire (Fiona) sang...which were Fiona's songs, if I'm correct.

The plot is also nothing if not plodding and badly written, not to mention the atrocious dialogue and poor staging. Some memorable bad lines include:

Billy Parker: ""YOU'VE been choppin' onions!"" (in response to Molly's tears)
Molly: ""No""
Billy: ""Then why are you crying?""
Molly: ""I have an eye disease""

(Soon after, instead of actually admitting why she's crying, she declares her desire to go skinny dipping...and they do! Thank God Bob didn't strip for this cruddy film!)

But what I give this film 2 stars for is the unintended comedic effects (such as in the scene described above), as well as the one suspenseful scene in the film, where James Colt has to confront a blind fan who's pointing a gun at him, following a show. I won't explain what happens, but it does add some much needed drama to the insipid plot.

One star for the glimmerings of 3-dimensional character exposition and tiny bits of good plot, and another star for the unintended comedy, including Billy's classic sucker-punch to the side of James's head. It's SO unrealistic and cartoonish as to be laughable. And yet it is perhaps the best moment in the entire film. (Look up the punch on YouTube if it's still there: CLASSIC!)",1235260800,,1887,4.706060606060606
7827912,5,6302587948,"Very interesting to see the different moods of Bob that you rarely see.  He is such a private person that it is amazing to see him go through different moods (laughing, being a little sexy, devilish, and a little naughty) all wrapped up in one movie.  I did not care for the other people in the movie, but just seeing DYLAN is all there is to see!!!  You get to see the moods in him you rarely see!!!  Staring at his sexy blue eyes, during the movie is breathtaking.  I was surprised that he is in the film, a lot longer than I thought he would be.  So if you are STRICTLY a Dylan fan, this movie is for YOU!!!!",1227139200,,611,4.05
7827913,3,6302587948,"Let me start off by saying I'm not the kind of couch-potato 'you-tube' geeks who like to use big words and obviously have written the other reviews about this movie. I'm generation-X if it matters, meaning I'm no hip-hopping SUV pothead with baggy pants and my hat sideways. Seen 'Rockstar' with Mark Walberg?...This is MTV's 1987 answer to that movie. So don't expect plot twists, shock scenes or any profound messages. This movie was a poster child for struggling singers, yeah, but it travels the same road as 'LaBamba' but without any death. The soundtrack for the movie is fantastic..Fiona Flanagan's power-charged ballads and her 'Heart'-like 'Hair of the Dog (That Bit You) are a nice treat for an 80s' fluff movie, and even Bob Dylan's songs are satisfying to someone NOT alive in the Vietnam 'peace love dove' no war smile on your brother days...(I despise people stuck in the Nixon era). 'Hearts of Fire' is a fluffy somewhat cheesy way of telling the story of young musicians who come up in the fast-paced world of rock stardom (ok, these days I guess white boys who rap)...regardless if you're a fan of 80s' music and fashion and you're not looking for an powerfull drama theres nothing wrong with this movie, its' $3 for crying out loud, there are gonna be plenty of rainy days this year.",1168646400,,1301,4.73568281938326
