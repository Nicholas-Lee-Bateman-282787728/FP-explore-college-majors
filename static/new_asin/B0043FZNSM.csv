8414892,4,B0043FZNSM,"This is a very interesting video especially if you have ever followed the findings of Jerry Ainsworth (such as his book The Lives and Travels of Mormon and Moroni.  Although the purpose of Jerry's research on this video was to find links between heiroglyphs found in Southern Utah and compared those to some found in Mesoamerica that may be the heiroglyphic signarture of Moroni, it is filled with a lot more interesting evidences and suggestions.  In particular I was impressed with his idea for what the Urim and Thummim may look like and the Jaredite spiral pyramid connection.  The production of this video may not be the best but it allows for some interesting insights.  I don't know Dane Hurt's history in video production but I like the product overall.  I would suggest this to other people.  I am actually surprised at how many people who are interested in Book of Mormon lands have never heard of this video. They are truly missing out.",1365120000,6,947,4.7439024390243905
