8549331,5,B00AAQMZAC,Once there existed a great channel called Cartoon Network this channel had a variety of cartoons from Hanna Barbera cartoons like The Jetsons to Huckleberry Hound to Space Ghost and M.G.M cartoons like Tom & Jerry and Droopy Dog and the Looney Tunes like Bugs Bunny these cartoons are been presented here in this Vhs called A Taste Of Cartoon Network this channel would not have existed if not for two amazing people like Betty Cohen and Jim Samples it was Betty Cohen that launched Cartoon Network back in 1992 but it was Jim Samples who made Cartoon Network such an amazing channel when Betty Cohen was in charge she over saw the launch of such amazing shows like Johnny Bravo Dexter's Laboratory The Powerpuff Girls Ed Edd n Eddy of course let's not forget the classics cartoons like Tom & Jerry or The Jetsons or The Flintstones or Jonny Quest and when Jim Samples took over in 2001 he oversaw and launched great cartoons like The Grim Adventures Of Billy & Mandy Samurai Jack Justice League Codename Kids Next Door Teen Titans Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi  The Life Times Of Juniper Lee and Camp Lazlo and other great cartoons include like: Megas X.L.R Duel Masters D.I.C.E and I.G.P.X like I said two great general mangers  of Cartoon Network. There times when I wished that ether Betty Cohen or Jim Samples was still in charge of Cartoon Network because if we look at Cartoon Network as of today its not the same as it once was and that all thanks to Stuart Snyder and Christina Miller now I don't need to get into how these two ruined Cartoon Network but I will say this about the A Taste of Cartoon Network Vhs was worth the wait and worth the pick-up and I want to thank the seller Complete Sentences Media and Amazon.com for allowing me to purchase the A Taste Of Cartoon Network Vhs  which is why I highly recommend getting this rare vhs because like I said if we look at Cartoon Network as of today its not the same and if we look back the old Cartoon Network that's where we will find greatness again and more to the point we will find the classic cartoons that we grew up with.
