After watching this Volume; now I know how much I didn't know about the game. Here is a wealth of information in easy to understand steps. You will want to watch this video over and over again. I learned something new about Chains that I didn't know before. Though Yu-Gi-Oh is a complex game. These three volumes ( New Duelist & Master Duelist) are a must to have in a players library but note changes have been made to the game in the last few months so always check in with the website I mentioned above for the latest news.

PLEASE NOTE: Some cards wordage and effects have changed since they have been printed. Go to [...] for latest updates",1114214400,,1485,4.714285714285714
