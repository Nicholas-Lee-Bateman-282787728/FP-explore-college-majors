Video quality is so poor that ""We'll sweep out the ashes"" with Emmylou Harris & Gram Parsons isn't actually what they were singing but is passed off as such.  Very obvious it's the wrong beat and not the words being sung.  Most of what is offered here is country versions of the songs once you get past the second offering.
