7425269,5,B014XABKAQ,"Viper fans have waited a very long time for this title to be released. The video and audio are very nice with this complete collection box set. The episodes are the original first-run syndication airings and are unedited, with the exception of the Pilot movie cut into a two-part episode. With that being said, the episode count is 79, so I'm not sure where they got 80 episodes. The DVD menus are a little lackluster in their appearance, but since every episode is there and complete, I have to give this a five-star rating!",1512777600,15,525,4.595744680851064
7425270,1,B014XABKAQ,"The Menu and video quality were top notch but I was very disappointed that the audio was only in
German and not English, it was not indicated on the listing.",1480982400,,157,4.266666666666667
7425271,5,B014XABKAQ,this TV series was great and it is still great I'm enjoying watching it,1522972800,,71,4.142857142857143
7425272,5,B014XABKAQ,I have been waiting for this show to come out on DVD for years and years and it definitly lives up to the hype. Its not HD or anything but it makes up for it by being a show that is engaging and fun to watch. The packaging is dynamic and well designed and looks great in any DVD collection!,1521676800,4,290,3.85
7425273,5,B014XABKAQ,"Nice to finally have a good copy of this show, not old VHS that was unwatchable.

I've only watched a bit of the pilot episode again so far but it looks and sounds as good as something of this age that hasn't been re-mastered would be. It would be really cool if they have the original film that they could re-do the transfer like was done for Star Trek TNG but I _highly_ doubt that would ever happen.

This is standard resolution TV from 20/30 years ago, not HD nor wide screen (as would be expected).
Just so people know more details about the product:
480i (interlaced video, meaning subtle scan lines can be seen)
Dolby 2.0 (stereo audio)
No captions / subtitles
4:3 standard aspect ratio.
14 dual layer DVDs, not copies, this is a real product.

Strange case, with CD/DVD sleeves that would be commonly found in trapper keeper type large CD cases.",1521331200,7,853,4.490322580645161

7425277,5,B014XABKAQ,I have waited for almost about 17 years for the show to come on DVD as a true die-hard fan that I record the show from VHS to transfer it to my own DVD and try my best to maintain as best as I can with the show's episodes I'm so grateful and happy  finally its on DVD as a Viper fan and as a car fan this is one of the top of the line science fiction crime-fighting car show you have to watch believe me,1520467200,,403,3.632183908045977

7425279,3,B014XABKAQ,"The show comes in a rather large plastic boxed set -- all four seasons.  Both picture and sound are great to me. However, while i like titles on each of the discs, i also prefer descriptions to each particular episodes in a card or booklet form. The discs come in plastic sleeves like a book. 3 stars for lack of episode descriptions.",1519257600,,334,4.387096774193548

7425282,5,B014XABKAQ,I loved everything about the viper collection. It brought back great memories when I first watched it.,1517702400,2,102,5.0588235294117645
7425283,5,B014XABKAQ,One of the best shows from the 90's Vei is a awesome company that takes the time to find classics that have been overlooked definitely by far my favorite company love the shows they release looking forward to seeing what the release in the future viper is a great show,1516752000,2,268,4.38
7425284,5,B014XABKAQ,"It's finally here, y'all!  VIPER on DVD!",1516752000,,40,4.714285714285714
7425285,5,B014XABKAQ,"I waited years for this. I couldn't wait for it to hit Amazon so pre-ordered straight from VEI.  At long last I got to enjoy the whole thing again. 4 seasons, 79 episodes (no idea why it said 80. I WISH that many had been made, the series was way too short, just really hit its stride to be cancelled) There are 14 discs. I enjoy the first and last season best as they had the original actors from the pilot, but the middle season is a lot of fun too. They don't make them like this anymore! Adventure, some sci fi twists, plus some humor and plenty of high action car chases for good measure.

The only flakiness was a bit of odd coloring / pixelation in red/blue police light scenes. But given that the show was never made for the widescreen HD TV I was watching on, its just a little quibble. It was worth every penny and I don't regret this purchase at all!",1515974400,5,861,4.149700598802395
7425286,5,B014XABKAQ,Waited a long time for it. Quality is pretty decent considering the first episodes were filmed 20+ years ago. Props for finally releasing it. Most of the 1st season was new to me.,1514937600,6,179,4.454545454545454
7425287,5,B014XABKAQ,"This is one of those shows that has managed to kinda wedge itself in my memory every since it premiered when I was a kid. For a long time, this show had never seen a official DVD release (at least not in the states) and it was virtually impossible to find episodes outside of some rather poor VHS bootleg copies flowing around the internet. I had all but given up hope that this show would ever see a proper release.

 Enter this DVD set. I had been following this set's release since VEI first announced it and while it has been a long wait, I think it has been rather worth it. The DVD's themselves are well packaged with a sturdy outer case housing a nice set of soft sleeves (no scratches during shipping!). The picture is generally fine. It is not going to be wide-screen or even HD (probably due to how the show was originally filmed) but the picture is of solid DVD quality and the audio is surprisingly great.

  This is one of those shows that you will probably buy because you are already a fan on some level. This set is certainly worth a purchase if you want to have a nice bit of nostalgia.",1514764800,14,1103,4.258373205741627

7425289,5,B014XABKAQ,"haven't opened the box set yet, a Christmas present and Christmas is not for a few days but it was exactly what I wanted from Santa, loved the show then, will enjoy the memories it brings",1513987200,3,187,4.222222222222222
7425290,5,B014XABKAQ,"This is a must for any car guy, Mopar fan, VIPER fan. VEI deserves a thanks for listening and releasing this great series. The episodes are in order, and come in a Sleeve inside a thick case. Very good idea for shipping!! Thank you VEI! The DVD's don't seem to have any issues, mind you I haven't watched all yet but, I skimmed through and they seem all good! THEY ARE ORIGINAL UNCUT NBC EPISODES in SEASON 1!!! The color and picture is good and it is remastered very well. Now the audio.... WOW it is fantastic for a 90's series. Dolby AUDIO BABY! WhooHoo!! VIPER fans will be pleased!",1512864000,11,586,4.336363636363636

8732177,5,B014XABKAQ,"Received as ordered. Nice case. The DVDs come in a CD holder basically and are labeled by the years and not the season. Also theres no order but it does have number discs for each year. 6 episodes are on each DVD and some seasons have 4 DVDs for it. As others have said, the quality is pretty good considering this was filmed as low budget for the mid 90's. At least the DVD does give you the best quality possible for the original recordings. They do put a warning notice on each DVD when you play it that even though this series is on DVD the quality is as it is and could not fix certain things to make it look better. In Other words they tried to enhance as best as possible but can only do so much. Im really satisfied with it considering. The menus are very easy and the theme music plays great with the GTS car showing in the background.",1532908800,,844,4.121212121212121
