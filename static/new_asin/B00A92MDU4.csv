5401615,1,B00A92MDU4,"I was all set to order season two, when I found out about the price. No thanks! I'm a big collector of all types of shows on dvd, but I've never in 10 years, EVER paid such a fee. Star Trek wasn't even this high. Eight Is Enough was a good show, but not this good. In 2002, I wanted the Brady Bunch more than any other set to be released, and, at first, it ran $25.00- $35.00. However, that was for the whole season. Now, as prices are finally coming down on all dvd's, that one goes for about $15.00. I even see I Love Lucy for $9.00 per season at Walmart. But none of this. Besides, that's really not the worst of it. These sets are manufactured ""on demand"", using dvd-r discs. Now that's cheap.",1355616000,14,697,4.094890510948905
5401616,1,B00A92MDU4,"This is totally crazy. Half a season at a full season's price. There were plenty of shows out there that were an hour long and sold their shows as complete seasons.(Examples: The Waltons, Little House on the Prairie) They did not feel the need to rip off the consumer by overcharging. It's like they want these shows not to sell, so they can stop releasing them right in the middle and consumers will be left with half a series and no hope of ever getting the rest. (like Love Boat). This was a good show with alot of happy memories associated with it - everyone wanted to be a part of the Bradford clan... I just don't know if it is worth it at this price. Please stop wasting our time with half seasons, it's an insult !!!",1355270400,12,724,4.253623188405797
5401617,1,B00A92MDU4,"Come on now $70 for Season 2 of a 30 year old show??  As much as I would like to own this latest season, I refuse to shell out so much money for it.  Once again, Corporate big wigs are figuring they can get over on consumers.  They did it with The Love Boat and now they are at it again.  No one should buy the dvd's until WB comes to its senses.  WB is totally out of touch with their viewing public.",1355184000,16,401,3.783132530120482
5401618,4,B00A92MDU4,"I loved seeing Season 1 of EIE, but when I saw they were selling the second season in two set, I was outraged. Why are the making the consumer pay twice at a high price for One season , but 2 dvd packs.
They did this with ""My Three Sons"".  The would sell them as Vol. 1 and vol. 2 - just to get more money.  Well they stopped producing anymore MTS dvd's probably because of poor sales.  I am afraid this might happen to Eight Is Enough.  If they weree able to put ""Charlie's Angels"", ""The Waltons"",
""Scarecrow and Mrs. King"" onto one dvd package, then they can do with EIE. They were all one hour shows.  Greed, Pure Greed by studios releasing these DVDs.  I will not purchase season 2 until the price comes down alot and feel bad because season 2 will have poor sales.",1355184000,4,769,4.162162162162162
5401619,1,B00A92MDU4,"I was afraid EIE would end up a MOD product.  But I could accept that if it wasn't broken in to 2 volumes, and at an outrageous price. COME ON!  Meet the consumers half way.  Either charge 35.00 for the complete season or charge 19.99 for each half season!! :(",1355011200,31,260,4.16
5401620,1,B00A92MDU4,Enjoyed seeing season 1 finally on DVD as this was one of my favorite shows from when I was a kid.  Although the idea of splitting into 2 parts AND charging $70 is BEYOND ridiculous!  Will not be buying this as it is a way to totally rip off fans.,1354752000,16,247,3.92
5401621,5,B00A92MDU4,"I love having the second season of Eight is Enough on DVD, even if I did have to purchase it in two parts!  I have been waiting so long to get this on DVD, and would have gladly paid more to get this set!  It was amazing to watch this series again, some of the episodes I barely remembered!  I pray  we get the rest of the seasons.  Two seasons are not enough!  I hope everyone with fond memories of this series, gets it!  We will never see television like this again.  It was just as good as I remembered, and I loved watching these episodes again!",1354233600,6,549,4.065420560747664
5401622,1,B00A92MDU4,"$32.00 for a ''measly'' 14 episodes? are they kidding? what ''genius'' at wb came up with the decision to take a season & release it in two seperate parts? the only reasoning behind this would have to be ''greed''! they want you to pay ''twice'' for something you should own in one volume! this is a complete turn off/rip off & warner archive should be ashamed of themselves! i can assure you, they will ''not'' get my money!!!",1354060800,20,427,4.487179487179487
5401623,1,B00A92MDU4,"They're charging $35 for three discs of season 2, and $35 for the other three. I'll wait 'till the price drops...A LOT!",1353628800,48,119,4.454545454545454
5401624,1,B00A92MDU4,$35.98 of half a season. $72.00 for all of Season 2.  Come on!  I am a fan of the series but this is just extortion. I can't imagine too many people are going to such ridiculous prices.  The fans deserve better.,1353628800,55,211,4.097560975609756
5401625,5,B00A92MDU4,So glad I bought this. Loved this show growing up. It's still as good as it was back in the 80's. I'll end up owning the whole series. I'm just waiting for 5 to come out.,1379030400,,170,3.75
5401626,5,B00A92MDU4,"If u grew up in the 70's this is a nice family show that are not made like this much anymore.
It deals with all family issues and brings u back before computers and iphones  and the only high tech was the good old typewriters and bell bottoms was in style.",1378166400,,256,4.019607843137255
5401627,5,B00A92MDU4,Love it very much can hardly wait for the rest of the series would buy again great organisation thank you,1375488000,,105,4.3
5401628,4,B00A92MDU4,"Given the cost of these sets, and the 35mm re-masters that Warner used for these sets, I'd like to know why they cut the concluding tag from Part 2 of ""Yes Nicholas, There Is A Santa Claus"".",1372636800,,190,4.162162162162162
5401629,4,B00A92MDU4,"My only complaint with this set (both part 1 and part 2) is that MOD orders are not commercial/retail quality. There are some spots in a couple episodes where the video/picture color quality is not good. And the audio is not at equal levels. However, to my knowledge, this is not the fault of this seller...it's because MOD orders are not retouched like they would be for retail sales. Overall, the lesser quality does not take away from the shows other than being noticeable.",1367884800,,476,4.678571428571429
5401630,1,B00A92MDU4,"Well I love the series! I remember watching it when I was younger. I continue to struggle with the ""modern day"" t.v. shows for my kids (11 & 9). No one makes good family center shows that display good family values and a sense that we are not in this alone. Disney t.v. makes kids think that singing and dancing (and kissing boys at 11) is what all kids in this country do. Meanwhile, either the show doesn't have parental influence or the parents are made to look uninvolved or stupid. I was so excited to see Eight Is Enough and other shows like it. I was about to put this series in my cart when sticker shock for the second season hit me! We need these shows in our kids lives again ... but in this economy,who can afford them?",1364860800,4,731,4.191489361702128
5401631,5,B00A92MDU4,"what can I say about this dvd set- eight is enough was one of my best shows back in the 90's . I watch these dvds quite frequently. I'm patiently waiting for season 3,4,5,etc. I highly recommend this set,especiakky if you were an eight is enough fan back then.",1362614400,,260,4.326530612244898
5401632,5,B00A92MDU4,They just don't make wholesome shows like this anymore. I really enjoyed this. Did you notice for a family of ten there is only one frige?,1362096000,,138,4.346153846153846
5401633,5,B00A92MDU4,Can't wait to see the rest of the season. I recommend this to anyone who was a Eight is Enough fan,1361750400,,98,3.7142857142857144
5401634,5,B00A92MDU4,"Like Part 2, of the 2nd Season, Part 1 is also Excellent.  I really love this television show, and I'm hoping that the Company or Companies that have Burned the Information on to these DVD's, will soon come out with the Remaining three { 3 } Seasons.  I alreadyhave the first { 1st } Two { 2 } Seasons, and there Both Superb; on a Scale of 1 through 10, One { 1 } being the Very Worst, and Ten { 10 } being the Very BEST, I would have to Rate this television show of Eight is Enough to be a "" 10 "".
  This show is Very Educational, when it comes to learning Respect, Understanding of other's, being Very Supportive of other's, when soneone, anyone is in Need of HELP, that we should do the Very Best that we can to go HELPING him / her, reguardles of One's Skin Color, Religion, the Language OR Language's that he / she goes Speaking { where there from in this World that we live in }, how to go making Sacraifce's for other's by NOT thinking of Ourselves, but rather thinking of Other's that are in Need of HELP, reguardless of what Help that they are in Need of HELP.",1361059200,,1069,4.076190476190476
5401635,5,B00A92MDU4,"I'll be the first to admit it!  I was reluctant to purchase the two volume set of Eight Is Enough (Vol. 1 and Vol 2 respectively of Season 2).  While I am not going to make an educated guess on WHY Warner Bros. decided to separate the Second Season I will say this:  let's stop all the complaining and enjoy it finally being released.  I've waited for years for this to come out and while we ALL don't mind spending HUNDREDS of dollars at Target or Wal-Mart on frivolous items we don't need each day...spend the extra and buy this.  The quality is 98 Percent FANTASTIC!  It was sealed and the dvd's were brand new and looked AWESOME.  Picture quality is awesome and the episodes are clear (there were a couple of moments but c'mon...the show is about 36 years old, right)?  I think it's cool they released it.  We all have a choice.  If you want to, then buy it!  Worth it.  If not...don't but c'mon...enough negative.  No one is MAKING you purchase it.",1359072000,4,953,4.377142857142857
5401636,5,B00A92MDU4,"Love this show, brings back childhood memories when we would all watch this show.  Price does not bother me, I will pay whatever I have to to get these episodes.  Cannot wait for Season 3!  Great DVDs!",1358899200,4,201,4.378378378378378
5401637,3,B00A92MDU4,The dvd's froze and went back to the beginning on a few episodes ex.wedding/christmas. My loves this show very much!,1358553600,,116,4.85
5401638,3,B00A92MDU4,Although I am glad I have the full episodes. My DVD's color was faded and in one scene a dark blue line down the center for a second. For this price I was expecting full restoration and closed captioning.,1358035200,3,204,4.256410256410256
5401639,5,B00A92MDU4,I really enjoyed this season....I liked the character of Abby coming on board. Real step parent issues along with the everyday problems that come with raising a large family. Very intertaining and cute series!,1357257600,2,209,5.176470588235294
5401640,3,B00A92MDU4,"Purchased so that young daughter could enjoy show that we enjoyed in younger days. Only negative is that this season was broken up into two DVD's and is the reason for my 3-star rating. Kind of pricey, but wasn't a deal breaker. Hope future releases correct this issue!",1357171200,3,269,4.625
5401641,5,B00A92MDU4,"I was able to snag these sets for $20.97 each from the WB website a few days after Christmas 2012. Just keep looking, and you will find the deals. Don't buy from the sellers who buy them from WB and mark them up outrageously.",1356825600,,225,4.136363636363637
5401642,5,B00A92MDU4,"I was hoping they were going to put these on dvd since they had alot of older shows on dvd but, no Eight Is Enough & soon as they released the 1st Season I jumped on it real quick.....one of my favorite shows",1356739200,,208,3.86046511627907
5401643,5,B00A92MDU4,it was great i love it i can watch it over and over can't wait till season 3 comes out keep up the good work,1356739200,,108,3.36
5401644,3,B00A92MDU4,It would be better if season 2 was not part 1 & 2 as its an extra cost that shouldnt be,1356652800,3,87,3.1904761904761907
8548677,5,B00A92MDU4,"One of my favorite shows, soon I will get the rest of the seasons as soon as I can.",1493424000,,83,3.4210526315789473
8548678,1,B00A92MDU4,"I loved this show as a kid, and if not for the fact I couldn't find the DVD elsewhere or the Christmas episode on YouTube, I would have never ordered it from this price gouging seller. You can bet I won't  be ordering anything else from the seller, however, and I highly recommend that no one else does, either.
As for the series - Eight is Enough was a great show that had a great cast, writers, and producers that handled a horrible situation (Diana Hyland's death) with the utmost class .. namely not insulting the audience by simply recasting the role or ignoring the situation completely.",1464566400,,593,4.542056074766355
8548679,5,B00A92MDU4,"Loved the show as a kid and love watching as an adult.  Brings back memories of the 70's-80's.  Good times, good times.",1422662400,,119,4.363636363636363

8548682,5,B00A92MDU4,I miss the Bradford family so much.  I am so pleased to find my most favorite childhood show on DVD.  The quality is just as good as I remember on Network tv.,1402272000,,158,3.90625
8548683,5,B00A92MDU4,Abby arrives in the 2nd episode and her folding into the family takes up the rest of the DVD.  The marriage of Tom and Abby and the Christmas where Tommy gets a present from his late mother are the highlight episodes.,1393027200,,217,4.2926829268292686
8548684,3,B00A92MDU4,"This is honestly the best show that was ever on television!  I grew up watching the re-runs, and I loved it!  Good, clean family entertainment at it's best.  My complaint?  Why don't you just rob us blind?  This price is exceptionally high, not to mention ridiculous, especially for only Part of one season.  No thanks.  as big a fan as I am, I'll wait for the price to come down.  There are lots of sites out there offering lower prices for used collections.  Listen to your customers, Amazon! You lost me on this one, not to mention many others.  I gave it three stars simply because the show is so awesome!",1390953600,,609,4.405405405405405
8548685,1,B00A92MDU4,"I have to wonder why shows like the beloved Eight Is Enough & Alice  are pressed in DVD-R format and not in standard DVD Video format as is the case with shows like Diff'rent Strokes, Laverne & Shirley, What's Happening & All In The Family.

It seems the new gimmick is to rip off the consumer, giving less for our dollar. As much as I love & have waited for Eight Is Enough to get released to DVD, I'm on the fence on buying this series' sets as not only is the cost exorbitant, but it stands to reason DVD-R format doesn't have the durability as standard DVD format.

There is no reason in the world why Eight Is Enough can't have a DVD Video release like a legion of other much-loved classics have had over the years & with much success I might add. I'm very disappointed about this marketing ploy & won't cough up a small fortune for a half number of episodes per set. I'll wait another 10 years for a legitimate release if I have to for another distributor who appreciates the series & its fans.",1384387200,3,1000,4.252631578947368
8548686,5,B00A92MDU4,I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good old fashion family series.  It has all the trials and tribulations of  family life and with eight kids there is definately heaps of problems to deal with.,1383004800,,204,4.486486486486487
