7829752,5,6302648602,"This is a great mini-series. Came out in, I think, 1979. Great story and great acting by all. For those interested in technical details I think you'll enjoy the technical and scientific details associated w/ defusing bombs.",1425340800,,223,5.054054054054054
7829753,5,6302648602,"Danger UXB is the story of British soldiers engaged in bomb disposal.  It is a story of the officers and men, who as a team performed this dangerous task on a daily basis from the start of the war and well beyond the end of it.
This is an ensemble cast that works well together from the young officer freshly commissioned and assigned to bomb disposal (""don't you have to volunteer?"")to the scientists working hand in hand with the military to come up with new ways to disarm more and more complex bomb fuses.  You have the fussy civilians worrying about their stores, to the bomb out people looking to see where they'll be living for the next few days.
The series bings out the interesting point that it is much more of a problem if a bomb does not explode than if it does.  The disruption to normal acitivity is shown quite well.
The team aspect is underscored because even though the officer is disarming the bomb, the sappers are out there digging for it and one wrong shove with a shovel or bang with a pick and the whole group thing goes up in a bang.
This is a specialty of military service with few walking wounded, you are either alive and sitting on a bomb or dead and only the birds can find the pieces.
I had a particular encounter with British Bomb Disposal when I was in Berlin, Germany in the late 70s on military service with the US Army.  I came home one afternoon and found the whole street blocked off.  When I asked an MP what was up, he told me that there were two bombs, one American and one British, that had buried in the mud and were discovered when a new autobahn was being built.  So while we waited, British and American bomb disposal personnel were working on bombs that were over 25 years in the mud and clay soil, just waiting to explode.  From this I viewed Danger UXB in a much more positive light.
I found this to be an exciting and well put together series.  It is a typical British top drawer program that Masterpiece Theater is to be commended for finding and introducing to American viewers.  I recommend this to any person interested in British military history and World War II.",1015372800,2,2118,4.368956743002545

7829755,5,6302648602,"VOLUME ONE (the first three episodes on this tape) OF A FIVE VOLUME SERIES
I swear, I've not met many people who have actually seen ""Danger UXB."" But those, maybe like me, who's whole family would  wait with eager anticipation each week for the next episode to come on,  speak so highly of it that you would think that it ranked with the classics  ""Upstairs Downstairs"" and ""The Jewel in the  Crown.""
""Danger UXB!,"" they'd say. ""That series is SO  wonderful!! Don't you remember how you felt knowing that your favorite  character whom you'd just spent three episodes growing to love might be  taking the last step of defusing the Nazi's horrible invention of an  'unexploded bomb' where the fuse is designed to detonate as it is being  removed and you don't know if that next moment will be their  last!""
This series is like the video equivalent of a ""page  turner.""",940032000,4,866,4.631578947368421
