This is the sort of packaging that serious collectors demand.  Kudos to the Blue crew.  Now, if only we could get a release for the grail of mondos, the 1974 cult classic 'Mondo Candido"".",1082937600,5,350,4.783333333333333
1880174,5,B000096IC0,"Thanks to William Lustig and the friendly folks at Blue Underground, serious fans of cinematic weirdness can check out the numerous films of Franco Prosperi and Gualtiero Jacopetti. Who are Prosperi and Jacopetti, you ask? Good question. Before checking out this awesome eight disc limited edition set, I knew little about these two Italian filmmakers. I once heard about ""Mondo Cane"" years ago, but had never investigated further. Thanks to the voracious appetites awakened in the masses with the advent of DVD technology, I finally got the chance to acquaint myself with this film and the others that followed it. What an experience! The eight discs in the set consist of ""Mondo Cane,"" ""Mondo Cane 2,"" ""Women of the World,"" ""Africa Addio: The Director's Cut,"" ""Africa Addio: English language version,"" ""Goodbye Uncle Tom: English language version,"" ""Addio Zio Tom: The Director's Cut,"" and an interview disc with the two directors created especially for this set called ""The Godfathers of Mondo."" So what does it all mean? According to these discs, the two filmmakers birthed a phenomenon that led directly to the current spate of reality-based media. Most of these films are documentary style epics showing our world--or at least how it looked back in the 1960s--in all of its bizarre and frivolous forms. ""Mondo Cane,"" by the way, translates as ""A Dog's World."" An apt title when you see the films, to be sure.
Start your experience with ""Mondo Cane,"" ""Mondo Cane 2,"" and ""Women of the World."" These are the first three films made by the two moviemakers, and are arguably the quirkiest. These three documentaries capture some of the oddest rituals practiced by peoples throughout the world. We see strange and bloody religious rituals in Italy, the grotesque lengths women will go to retain their youthful appearance, animals dying from radiation poisoning in the South Pacific, shark hunts, the horrific effects of Thalidomide, primitive peoples in New Guinea building shrines to airplanes, and so many other diverse oddities that it simply staggers the imagination. Many scenes are tame to modern eyes, some are still shocking, and several are just plain amusing. For example, you will laugh yourself sick over the ""slap the faces"" concert seen at the end of ""Mondo Cane 2,"" although the participants look decidedly unhappy over their performance. There are plenty of extras on these three discs, including poster stills, trailers, and a few other worthwhile goodies; the picture quality is so good, so crystal clear, that the colors simply take your breath away.
Perhaps the most controversial film made by Prosperi and Jacopetti was ""Africa Addio"" (""Farewell, Africa""), an attempt to document the changes in Africa during the time when the European imperial powers granted independence and withdrew from the continent. Ultimately accused of racism by critics for their unflinching portrait of a region gone mad, ""Africa Addio"" reveals in grisly detail the monstrous crimes committed by indigenous Africans against the remaining white settlers and the local wildlife. Large segments of the film show poachers brutally killing animals in the parks set up by Europeans. Moreover, the killing extends to humans as civil wars break out across the continent, with Africans killing each other, slaughtering Muslim minorities, and battling white mercenaries. Two executions caught on camera eventually resulted in charges against Gualtiero Jacopetti, who stood accused of orchestrating the killings for the camera (he was eventually exonerated). As tough as this film is to watch, try and look past the bloodshed and enjoy the panoramic scenery found in nearly every scene. Africa, despite all of its troubles, truly is a beautiful land.
Nothing will prepare you for the nightmarish images in ""Addio Zio Tom,"" (Goodbye Uncle Tom) a film made to counter charges of racism stemming from the ""Africa Addio"" experience. Fashioned as a sort of pseudo documentary where the filmmakers go back in time and visit the American South during the slave era, the movie is a grim look at the degrading conditions faced by Africans brought here as chattel. Every scene is absolutely mind blasting stuff, a horrific recreation of such abhorrent activities as the breeding of slaves, the formulation of scientific racism, hunting down and killing escaped slaves, the sickening conditions of the slave ships, the slave markets, and a billion other objectionable situations. The filmmakers based their film on written records and accounts of slave life, ultimately using the issue of slavery to make a statement about contemporary (1960s and 1970s) American race relations. Be sure and watch both versions: the English language cut is an entirely different film from the director's cut. Both are grueling experiences tempered only slightly by Riz Ortolani's FANTASTIC musical score (Ortolani scored ""Mondo Cane"" as well and snagged an Academy Award nomination for the song ""More"" from that film).
""The Godfathers of Mondo"" provides plenty of information about the collaboration between Prosperi and Jacopetti, Ortolani's musical work on the films, and a chronological discussion of each film. The impression I took away from the ""Mondo Cane"" films was the silliness of humanity in general, how we all do ridiculous things in our everyday life and never give any of it a second thought. At the same time, we are capable of particularly vicious activities that we never give a second thought to, either. With ""Africa Addio"" and ""Addio Zio Tom"" the whole scope of Prosperi and Jacopetti's documentary style changed. These films dwell on human beings as barbarians engaged in enormous bouts of cruelty and bloodshed. One of the filmmakers says in ""The Godfathers of Mondo"" that violence is a part of life that should appear in any attempt to document the human experience. I agree wholeheartedly, but that doesn't make these two films any easier to watch. Thanks, Blue Underground, for a truly memorable experience.",1075766400,41,5992,5.22972972972973
1880175,5,B000096IC0,"There is no denying the importance of the films of Gualtiero Jacopetti and Franco Prosperi as they have influenced everything from hardcore horror films ie Cannibal Holocaust to broadcast news and the reality TV craze of today. Blue Underground in an ambitious move have put out this great 8 disc box set (limited to 10,000 copies) which should more than satisfy any mondo fan.
The first two discs are Mondo Cane and Mondo Cane 2. Mondo Cane is certainly a milestone and in fact this entire genre of ""shocking documentaries"" which where made by Euro filmmakers is better known as the 'mondo' genre. Essentially Mondo Cane is a strange journey into some of the more bizarre and macabre places with the camera voyeuristically witnessing all kinds of oddities and bringing them back for the curious viewer. Mondo Cane 2 continues this tradition. The third disc Women of the World is similar but all the footage is tied together by a common theme of the varied roles women play in different parts of the world.
The next 2 discs are the cut English language version of Africa Addio and the Italian language uncut version. Considered by many to be the greatest mondo doco of all time, the crew head of into Africa during it's transition from colonial control. While the majority of this focuses on the interactions of white and black and some long sequences on the fate of wildlife with laws protecting them diminished (countless animals are gunned down and speared in these scenes and hippos are dismembered) what sets this apart is the aftermath of several massacres caught on film. Later the crew hook up with a group of mercenaries (these nuts look as though they just walked of col. Kurtz's compound in 'Apocalypse Now') and go on a mission, filming a couple of executions.
After the English language print was recut to exclude much political commentary and the censored version was released the film makers came under fire and accused of exploitation, racism and some even called them murders (accusing them of paying for the executions). Being labeled racists must have really angered  Jacopetti and Prosperi resulting in them making Addio Zio Tom (Goodbye Uncle Tom) in order to prove that they are not racist.
The next 2 discs are Goodbye Uncle Tom in the cut English version and Italian Language directors cut (this disc alone in worth the price of the set). The butchered English version done little to mend their reputations as in order to have it released alternate versions of scenes were shot and some extreme (but easily justified) politics were omitted. In essence it became a different movie.
The director's cut of Goodbye Uncle Tom is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen. While some scenes are mondo filmed modern 70's events in America, the majority of this film is a departure of the mondo formula as they have made a regular motion picture with actors and sets under the pretense of them traveling back in time to shoot a mondo doco on the slave trade in America pre civil war. All these scenes are set up based on factual accounts and are unsparingly brutal and authentic, literally using 1000s of extras. The sweeping photography and epic scale of this film as we are taken into various aspects of slavery make for a simply breathtaking motion picture experience.
Some people have claimed these scenes are a false representation, by pointing out silly little things like ""there probably wouldn't be so many slaves in the house"" and ""they wouldn't be allowed to jump on the bed like that"" as well as others who are infuriated by this film claiming that ""it was never as depraved as this"" but once again this film is clearly well researched quoting writers of the time and besides how could any people who kept slaves not be ""depraved"" anyway? Gone With the Wind this certainly is not. Roots, while well made and genuinely heartfelt, is pure sacarine by comparison. Steven Speilberg made the typically cowardly film 'Amistaad'. How can this courtroom drama depicting Europeans as being cruel to slaves and Americans liberating them via the righteous legal system be hailed as ""tackling slavery head on"" when it completely ignores the 200 years of slavery in America? Goodbye Uncle Tom is clearly a one of a kind spectacle and in my humble opinion the best disc in the set.
The final disc is a doco on the filmmakers themselves, rounding out what is an awesome boxset!",1068422400,24,4394,4.796833773087071
1880176,5,B000096IC0,"When MONDO CANE first came out it was the ""adults only"" film every kid like me wanted to see. Needless to say, what was considered shocking and adult in the 60s all seems rather quaint in retrospect. Yet, it's a short distance from the Mondo craze of yore to the ""shocking reality TV"" we are saddled with today. With all that in mind, I ordered the Mondo Collection and figured $127 was a small price to pay for a little trip down memory lane. To my surprise and delight, the 8-disc set is a primo package. (Think Criterion Collection in terms of quality and restoration but from a company called Blue Underground.) All the shockumentaries are in the package, not to mention ""The Godfathers of Mondo"" documentary about the guys---the trailblazers---who gave us these films. Soon every schlock filmmaker would crank out a Mondo-this and Mondo-that shockumentary, hoping to out-Mondo everybody else. But, again, this collection gives us the real thing from the guys who put the word Mondo on the map. And, lest we forget, every time we hear a lounge singer do ""More,"" we'll fondly think back to its origin: Mondo Cane.  Buy this set and enjoy!",1067558400,13,1141,4.733668341708543
7989939,4,B000096IC0,"Haven't seen them all.  I have been loving Riz Ortolani soundtracks since the 70's and looked forward to seeing the films with his music. These extremely powerful documentaries are incredible, but no for everyone.  Fridays we shoot the hippos.  I am surprised the photographers survived.  Beautifully remastered.",1498348800,,312,5.574468085106383
7989940,5,B000096IC0,I saw these movies as a teenager when I was in NYC. If I remember correctly some  of them were playing at the Waverly for the midnight show. If you have not seen them you should. The best of the worst exploitation films.,1478044800,,220,4.116279069767442

7989943,5,B000096IC0,"""Mondo Cane/Women of the World"" is actually pretty tame.  Although, it may have been considered shocking back in the 60s, it plays like a National Geographic TV special.  Definitely not scary or shocking today.

""Africa Addio"" is very informative.  The film is a heroic attempt to explain the demise of the continent and people of Africa.  This film should be required viewing for high schoolers and college African studies courses.

""Addio Zio Tom"" is the most shocking of the set, and the primary subject of this review.  It is a staged documentary about the horrors of slavery in America, via interviews with the white slave-owners, as well as some of the slaves.  Initially, the only complaint is that in the theatrical release version the seemingly hundreds of slave characters were given almost no voice in the film.  How could the directors present the horrible reality of slavery without giving the slaves a voice?

This is why it's so important to view ""Addio Zio Tom"", the director's cut.
It not only gives the slaves more of a voice, it also connects slavery to the condition of 1960s African-Americans and the righteous anger they held against whites.  Jacopetti and Prosperi must have been mortified to find that all reference to the ""angry black man"" had been editted down to only the mock modern-day ""Nat Turner"" footage.

There is hardly any representation of modern-day 1960s Black women in the theatrical release - while long stretches of the film are dedicated to watching blonde-haired, blue eyed women do things like bounce around on a trampoline, or run along the beach in slow-motion.  These ""beautiful white women"" scenes contain no dialogue or narration.  What is supposed to be inferred?

The director's cut shows that images of modern day Black Women were left on the cutting room floor.  The material omitted from the theatrical release says almost as much about race relations in the 1960s as the statement made by the director's cut.

The strangest edit of all happens at the end of the theatrical release film.  The theatrical version of the ""Nat Turner"" murders is actually bloodier than the director's cut.  Why was so much that may have been considered offensive cut out, while the baby-killing scene (with the fake baby-doll) was made bloodier?  What's up with that?

I have yet to view the ""Africa Addio"" director's cut.  If the director's cut of ""Addio Zio Tom"" is any indication, I'm sure I'm in for another eye-opening experience.",1207526400,,2469,4.941747572815534
7989944,5,B000096IC0,"A collection of controversial and infamous mondo documentary films from the 60's and are quite educational yet disturbing at times. Long before ""Faces of Death"", there was these Italian imports that have become grindhouse theater favorites over the years, sure there are scenes of graphic animal mutilation, war footage, executions, casual information of different cultures around the world, subject of racism, bug eating, and that kind of thing.

If you can handle some of the subject matter in this movie, you'll be pleasantly suprised of how entertaining and informative these movies are.  Better than ""Faces of Death"", these are a must have for the collectors of documentaries and horror alike!",1200096000,,698,5.336363636363636
7989945,5,B000096IC0,"what happened to the lyrics for MORE!!!!?? I recall it was sung during the ""blue"" painting section.  The wonderful book, HOLLYWOOD SINGS, confirms that. Lyrics had to be written to get a Best Song Oscar nomination.",1141776000,,214,4.944444444444445
7989946,3,B000096IC0,"This film is incomplete. It never reveals upon the begginning the resistance the African American showed toward this creature some reviews failed to identify with, calling this person a human not ""white monster"" and dark age mad ball. If you have dislexia this film serves this honor. It seems to be backwards from the cuts and certain segments others seem timely.  It identifies with the sick behaviors of the present day system and psychology and menality of the system per se in charge. It never ceases to amaze me no matter how truthful the content must be, always the truth is twisted and perverted to fit the person who made or created this mess which doesn't make it better, but even worse. The truth doesn't hurt but it heals, educates, and stimulates wisdom and growth because these characters ensemble small minds of men and women then and now.  It depicts this impotent man who lives a fassade to trick others into the false belief that he is superior but needs young girls to have sex with, rape to feel sexually sufficient. Check the catholic churches and present day sexual behavior of the practice of most sexual assaults and molestations. This movie shows both the aspects of corruption by the white structure as well as the most welcoming and subdued African's later to be tainted as the black race which still is resilient in the most of certain efforts to overcome the retardation of racism and unjust treatment. The civil rights act is one that needs to be cancelled along with the voting act. If blacks are citizens and the constitution honors all natural born citizens which this movie proves by hundreds of years of them being in American, building America and dying for the hypocritical notions of America. Certainly through African Americans, Blacks or what have you they have a prominent place in this society over most if not all. This movie doesn't seem to leave the African with much dignity nor reveal there pride like they had and have and will remain as long as they are in existance which they certainly are and won't be going anywhere by the TRUTH of HISTORY and BY GOD if you will. Certainly one must view this with an insight and telepathy of spiritual discernment, knowledge and independent thinking.",1134000000,2,2237,4.777777777777778
7989947,5,B000096IC0,"When I was a child living in Africa there had always been this almost mythical rumor that a movie existed that chronicled the atrocities that happened when the Europeans left Africa. The movie was censored. Seeing it for myself, well all of the rumors didn't prepare me for what I saw.

These pioneers of shockumentary actually took the time and risked their lives to show what was happening in their world through a camera lens that never favored one side or the other. All of the DVDs in the 8 disk pack are thought provoking. Leaving you with a sense that what ever you do see (headlines or news) in our world may not be the entire story.

Unfortunately I think that these classics may be overshadowed by fake documentaries or ones where the director asks leading questions. This is not the case in the Mondo Cane Collection. The collection is a little pricey, but well worth the education.",1124064000,8,893,4.610062893081761
7989948,5,B000096IC0,"I love this set.  It is well worth every penny I spent.  I watched the Mondo Cane films when I was a teenager and really enjoyed them.

These are the original Mondo films.  These sparked the entire Mondo shockumentary genre.  Some other quality masterpieces such as Shocking Asia I and II to the prolific garbage fake mondo documentaries.

The poor reputation of the fake mondo documentary has caused the Mondo Cane series to be tarnished with this image.  What was enjoyable is that everything in Mondo Cane is real.  The only things staged were still true but needed to fix other footage that was lacking and it was kept to an extreme minimum.

I had only heard of Mondo Cane I and II when I bought this but the other films are great surpise finds.  Women of the World is a documentary done basically the same as the Mondo Canes.

Africa Addio is quite literally one of the greatest documentaries ever made.  It is about the changes in Africa during the time when the British left.  It spans the light-hearted of the calm of South Africans jumping on trampolines to showing dead bodies scattered in other African countries.

You see poacher's warehouses literally with football fields of elephant tusks stored in rows on the floor.  You also see piles of human hands that occured in war atrocities.  It is quite an honest documentary that shows what others would choose not to.

Goodbye Uncle Tom is an extremely graphic drama made to be as if it was a real documentary during slavery times.  There is tons of full nudity male and female and extremely graphic things depicted I won't describe here.  Jacopetti and Prosperi made this to fight charges that they were rascists which they were accused of regarding Africa Addio. (Why Im Not Sure).  This instead caused quite the opposite causing them to be labeled extreme rascists.  This is one of the most notorious films ever made.  I really was surprised by the graphic nature of what I've seen and I am the kind that wonders what is shocking in movies like Bloodsucking Freaks or I Spit On Your Grave.  This wasn't shocking to me but I was surprised that they went so far with this movie.

The last disc is a documentary on Jacopetti and Prosperi.  A highlight is them talking about almost getting executed while filming Africa Addio.  They were going to be lined up for execution when someone stated they are not ""whites"" (meaning British) and were Italians.

This is a prize in my DVD collection. One that I will watch over and over.  In my opinion, Blue Underground is better than Criterion and Anchor Bay and this set is outstanding.  I only hope they take interest in and are able to release the Shocking Asia series.

If you only heard of Mondo Cane and don't want to spend the price for this set just for those 2 films, get this.  The other films are just as good if not better.

2 of the films are the original language director's cut.  5 great films.  A great documentary on these great filmmakers. And two original language versions (which differ greatly from the English language versions)

This is limited edition and I can't imagine anything this good coming around often!",1115424000,9,3138,4.633393829401089
