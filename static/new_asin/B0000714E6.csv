She instist on thinking she is a beast or animal and the other beast animal thing is crazy and to interested in woman even though he seeing his teacher and assistant having sex all the time when his teacher already has a girlfriend.

1799455,5,B0000714E6,"While Hollywood continues to pump out uninteresting, action packed, technologically expensive fodder....movies that do nothing for you but leave you lighter in the pocketbook.........there comes along a group of directors who challenge the way you view films and think about them.  Michel Gondry is one of them.  He is a very creative director with tons of music videos to his credit.  He has done music videos for artists such as Radiohead, Bjork, and Cibo Matto.  If you've ever seen any of his work, you will know what I am referring to.  He does not come up short with this film.  If you enjoy watching films that entertain the mind, this film is a must see.  I have been waiting a long time to see Human Nature and it was well worth the wait.  This is instantly one of my favorite films.  Rent it or buy it when you have the chance.  --Other films that I recommend:  1. One Hour Photo by Mark Romanek  -2.  CQ by Roman Coppola -3.  Sexy Beast by Jonathan Glazer -4.

1799457,2,B0000714E6,"If you want to see this film because you loved ""Being John Malkovich"" you will almost certainly be disappointed. The two films are not of the same quality, they are not even in the same range of quality.
I think Charlie Kaufman is one of the most important writers writing screenplays today, and everything I've read of his (from ""Being John Malkovich"" to ""Adaptation"") had been superb, but ""Human Nature"" simply did not translate well from page to screen.
And I can't say that it is necessarily all Michael Gondry's fault in his direction. While, I think part of the problem is that Gondry didn't ""get"" the screenplay, part of the problem is that this was Kaufman's first script and while entertaining on the page, when put on screen, without the humorous writing style and Kaufman's cynical voice ... well, the filmable elements simply don't hold together.
Wait for ""Adaptation"" or ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" both of which promise to be better. They could hardly be worse.",1035849600,4,982,4.851190476190476
1799458,4,B0000714E6,"Coming off the unquestioned success that was ""Being John Malkovich"", Charlie Kaufman (and Spike Jonze, who produces here) again brings us a comedy that'll have you scratching your head in wonderment, your mouth agape in awe, and your belly laughing hysterically, even though you're not quite sure if what you're seeing is really all that funny.  ""Human Nature"", like ""BJM"", is a film that's tough to define, tough to comprehend, but not so tough to enjoy.
It's a film that purports to be one about big ideas -- concerning, duh, human nature -- but that really doesn't give much weight to those ideas.  I got the feeling that the ideas were just the hanger off which Kaufman and Co. could drape comic set-pieces, gags, and pratfalls.  If you look at it as an intellectual exercise, it does not work.  But as a loony farce, it's terribly hilarious, in a rather bent sort of way.  One of my favourite sequences shows the ridiculous tableaus Dr. Nathan Bronfman (Tim Robbins) and his assistants assembled inside the observation cage of Puff (Rhys Ifans), a feral man found in the woods.  At one point, a fake fireplace turns up; later, we see Puff in an opera box seat, dressed in tuxedo and clapping enthusiastically to the sounds coming out of a portable radio.  Another favourite moment shows the comic repression essayed by Nathan's parents, played with deadpan glee by Robert Forster and Mary Kay Place.
Director Michel Gondry doesn't mimic the baroque expressiveness that Spike Jonze found in ""Being John Malkovich"".  Instead, he goes for stark cartoonery.  Watch as Ifans flies through the air more than a dozen times after being zapped by an electronic collar.  Or the sweet (and subversive) song Lila (Patricia Arquette) delivers as an ode to her hyper-hirsuteness.  Or Robbins, recounting his part of the story, ignorantly repeating the same silly joke over and over until the audience is forced to laugh at him.  ""Human Nature"" makes no attempt at reconstructing reality; instead it focuses all its energies on creating a reality, one that's malleable and morbid, twisted but bright.
Kaufman's script plays more like a series of Saturday Night Live skits than a follow up to the nineties' most popular existential cult classic.  He revels in his one-joke characters, but makes sure that the one-joke is as strong as can be (the central conceit of Ifans character, that he was raised in the woods by a man who ""thought"" he was an ape, was enough in itself to draw me to the film).  And except for what he gives to Robbins' character (who's speeches, even though they're *meant* to be ultra-formal, were still often distracting and clumsy), the dialogue is fresh and frequently funny.  ""Eet izz like 'Sophie's Choice',"" says Nathan's assistant, Gabrielle.  ""Exzept no, eet izz 'Nathan's Choice'.""  The narrative he's constructed skips and swings all over the place, unburdened by any and all film conventions.  It's told from three different perspectives, testimonial style, a technique that doesn't work in the film's nascent stages, but does as it nears its conclusion.  And it gives the audience ample opportunity to get to know the three main characters, independently and as a unit.
Robbins, in the beginning, appears ill at ease playing Dr. Bronfman.  In much of the comic work he's turned in over his career, Robbins is fine at playing idiotic idiot-savants (""The Hudsucker Proxy"", ""Bull Durham"").  But he tends to have trouble with quiet solemnity (""The Shawshank Redemption"") even when it's within the context of a farce like this one.  As the movie moves along, though, Robbins takes centre stage -- he is the sun in this particular universe; all the other actors revolve around him -- and he becomes more relaxed.  And more funny, even during his straighter moments.
Arquette plays Lila's discomfort and pathos well, and gets her innocence just right.  And she's super sexy, even when covered top to toe by hair.  In the film's middle third, when her obsessions take over and she's meant to be soulless and creepy, you still can't help feeling for her, caught in such a ridiculous predicament.  And more so in this one than in her other films, Arquette's stalactite teeth appear to be a character all to themselves.  Gondry films her erratic mouth in such a way that the audience feels a threat of attack (an odd character point, that).
Ifans, in the film's most showy role, steals the show.  But he doesn't do it in an outlandish way.  He could have barged around the set, grunting and groaning, and relying on his bare bottom to draw as many laughs as possible.  But instead, Ifans has to play sophistico and Cro-Magnon, sometimes all in one scene, and always subtly.  He is achingly funny, terribly tragic, cold and manipulative, open and warm-hearted.  An egoless actor in a spindly naked Englishman's body, Ifans is perfectly cast and perfect in execution.
While not as easy a crowd-pleaser as Kaufman's previous work, ""Human Nature"" has its fair share of oddball moments.  Enough so that anyone looking for another iconoclastic romp will do well enough if they look here.",1020124800,11,5093,4.912383177570093
1799459,2,B0000714E6,"""Human Nature"" shows what can happen when a couple of filmmakers allow critical acclaim for a previous work to go to their heads.  Writer Charlie Kaufman and co-producer Spike Jonze were the creative forces behind the almost universally praised ""Being John Malkovich"" from a few years back (Jonze was the director of that film actually, while Michael Gondry gets that credit on this film).  ""Offbeat"" and ""bizarre"" were probably the mildest terms one could apply to that movie, but no matter how utterly insane the proceedings became, one could never fault ""Being John Malcovich"" for being a messy, undisciplined work.  ""Human Nature"" is another case altogether.  Kaufman seems to have fallen into the trap of believing that, as long as you have at least some unifying theme upon which to hang your unconventional components, you are free to put pretty much anything you want up on the screen and get away with it.  Guess again.
The theme Kaufman has chosen to explore is that old chestnut about how humans, in their attempt to deny their ancestral association with the animal kingdom, are always working to suppress their natural instincts under the weight of ""civilization"" and ""culture.""  All the characters in this film are, in one way or another, trying to repress either their own basic animal nature or trying to repress someone else's.  Thus we have beautiful Patricia Arquette portraying a young woman who, through a hormonal fluke that seems to harken back to humanity's evolutionary connection with our fellow primates, has had to endure (from puberty on up) a body almost completely covered by hair.  Therefore, she spends most of her adult life undergoing painful electrolysis treatments under the patient and sympathetic tutelage of Rosie Perez.  The irony is that Arquette, even after she has come to accept her natural state, realizes that she can only get her sexual needs met if she conforms to society's standards of physical beauty.  Tim Robbins plays a bizarre cross between Charles Darwin and Professor Henry Higgins as a researcher who lives to make animals more human-like in their behavior and finds his most intriguing challenge in a man the two of them discover living on his own in the wild - having been raised by his deranged father to believe he actually IS an ape (Rhys Ifans plays the human guinea pig).  He, too, finds that he can only achieve sexual gratification if he, paradoxically, plays by civilized society's rules.
It's hard to know whether or not this particular material could ever have been successfully realized on screen, no matter who thought it up Perhaps the imagery - of a hirsute Arquette, of a naked Ifans - is simply too unappealing and unpleasant to raise any emotion other than disgust in the viewer.  Perhaps it is the obvious, heavy-handed nature of the theme or the chintzy way in which it is visualized that keeps the concept earthbound.  Whatever the cause, ""Human Nature"" thuds along from one unfunny scene and moment to the next, doing little but embarrassing these otherwise fine actors and actresses in the process.
Recently, in an earlier review, I lamented the fact that there seemed to be no end to bad reworkings of the ""Pygmalion"" story - and, alas,  ""Human Nature"" can now be added to that growing list of hopeless failures.  The only consolation, in fact, may be that George Bernard Shaw is not around to have to witness them all.  Perhaps now we can finally move on to fresher territory.",1018742400,8,3460,4.909090909090909

1799462,4,B0000714E6,"Remember ""Being John Malkovich""?  Charlie Kaufman, who wrote that strange movie, is the writer of ""Human Nature,"" a strange but very intelligent film.  This time the task of director is handed to Michel Gondry from France, famous for his music video clips made for Bjork (""Human Behavior"" and others).  But don't be put off by his profile because Gondry wisely avoids any flashy techiniques you might associate his MTV profile with.  In fact, his fashion often seems very orthodox.
""Human Nature,"" Kaufman's newest produced film, deals with four persons trapped in a maze of love, or sexual desire (call it human nature) ... so to speak.  As is the case with ""Being John Malkovich,"" Kaufman's style easily defies our ready-made concept of movies, so I just tell you what you see.  Tim Robbins (one of his best turn) is a scientist who spends his time trying to teach proper table manners to white mice.  A nature writer Patricia Arquette, hairiest woman in the movie history, falls in love with him.  Meanwhile, somewhere in the forest, a grown-up man (Rhys Ifans of ""Notting Hill""), who believes that he is an ape, is found, and the Tim immediately got interested.  He contemplates: ""Let's educate him as a human.""  Well, after naming him ""Puff,"" with a help of an electric collar and some nude photos, Dr. Robbins tries to 'cure' Puff of his nasty, die-hard habits of showing 'human nature' or sexual desire, explicitly in the public.
While the experiment proceeds, love relations got complicated as a famale assistant Gabrielle (played by wonderful Miranda Otto, seen in ""Thin Red Line"" and ""What Lies Beneath,"" with too obvious French accent) is involved.  The love triangle gets more confused after eventual inclusion of Puff, who slowly starts to change himself from an ape-like man with long beard -- Rhys Ifans at first looks like ""It's"" man of Monty Python shows -- and  ...  guess the rest of it for yourself.  Anyway,  Kaufman's creative power does not belong to the traditional sense of storytelling, and we know it.
Just like ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Human Nature"" is full of brilliant ideas, but the whole touch of the film is less outlandish than the other.  Actually, you may say some scenes  are direct parody of methods used in classic Hollywood films, and some scenes, especailly opening ten minutes, even remind you of films such as ""American Beauty"" and ""A Life Less Ordinary.""  By saying that, I do not mean the lack of originality; rather, the director Gondry is cleverly challenging us with unique skills shown in these film, deftly using them to his purpose.
And the most amusing thing about ""Human Nature"" is its ever-changing relationships of love between four characters, among which Puff's sadly too human nature plays the most prominent role.  The process of Puff's ""education"" contains funny, but very poignant moments, and what we laughed at loud in ""American Pie"" (my favorite) we see in a completely different light.  At same time, the film mocks American values very slyly.  See, for example, how Tim Robbin's scientist is easily captivated by a phoney French Gabrielle with dubious accent (and don't miss the quick change of her French 'room  decoration'!!).  Also of note are Robert Forster and Mary Kay Place's forster parents, whose dead-pan humor leaves us great impression in spite of their brief screen time.
This off-beat film probably ends too neatly after many elements are thrown in the film, but I didn't feel the film is confused.  I admit ""Human Nature"" may not draw a lot of critical or commercial attention; it is a shame, though,  because it is a very clever film, and even if it is not totally coherent or logical, it at least gives us fresh and powerful talent upcoming in this industry.  For that only, it should be called something, something precious.",1016582400,33,3808,4.901716068642746

Females fight against nature tooth-and-nail (think cosmetics industry), and ultimately ""sell their soul"" to land a relationship (and the requisite baby).

Sounds pretty cynical, yet accurate, doesn't it?  I don't think the human species, or any species at that, has ever made it far without a healthy prioritization of sex.  What this movie does, however, is attempt to peel back the veneer we have painted upon ourselves.

I had this movie on my ""to watch"" list, but forgot why it was there.  Shortly into it, I got weirded-out by the imagery and matter-of-fact treatment of some pretty ludicrous scenes.  I thought, ""Is this a joke?""  I stuck with it and only during the end credits did I realize it was Michel Gondry and Spike Jonze flick, and a Charlie Kaufmann Freudian-tinged script.

I'm sure there's much to this movie that I am missing (What is the meaning of the scientist's new little brother?  Where exactly is the white room?).  I'm purposely writing this review before reading any other reviews or analysis at all, so I can't pretend that I figured out all the metaphor and simile on my own.

1799489,3,B0000714E6,"I have to admit, I had really high hopes for this movie. Made by Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry, the same writer/director team that worked together on one of my favorite movies ('Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'), and featuring Rhys Ifans and Miranda Otto, who were so good together in another favorite of mine ('Danny Deckchair'), I figured I had good reason to get excited about this.  While I was not completely disappointed, it should be said that 'Human Nature' was something of a letdown for me.

At least it's original.  'Human Nature' is the story of four people who come together through some pretty unique circumstances.  Tim Robbins is a scientist trying to teach table manners to mice, as the result of an interesting set of neuroses.  Patricia Arquette, cursed since puberty with out-of-control body hair, plays Robbins' girlfriend and eventual assistant. Rhys Ifans is the scruffy man who was raised as an ape in the wild. And rounding out the list is Miranda Otto, the cute French lab assistant who has bigger dreams and naughtier intentions.  Nobody in the film, of course, is quite what they seem or what they wish to be, and as the story progresses they all interact in different (often surprising!) ways. At the very least, the story will keep your attention to see what happens next.

Hilary Duff fans, take note...she appears for maybe 30 seconds in 'Human Nature' as a young (teenage) Patricia Arquette, when she first discovers her hair growth.  It was a surprising appearance if you're not expecting it (I wasn't), but nothing to get excited about if you're a fan.

'Human Nature' has its funny moments, and its sad moments, and many that are an odd mixture of both.  As Robbins and Arquette first find the man-ape Ifans, their ideas of his situation are completely opposite: Robbins wants to re-train the apeman to be a refined and dignified gentleman, while Arquette wants to let him explore his freedom.  Otto's French lab assistant's motives aren't ever really clear, except for the idea that she's mostly looking out for herself.  The thematic question becomes obvious: which is the 'true' nature of humanity?  Is humanity defined by it's ability to rise above the base animal instinct and be civilized, or is it preferable to free the beast within us and live as we wish? The film provides no ready answer to this, but does give you the chance to explore the ideas of it.

There's nothing specific I found disappointing about the movie, just a general feeling that at some point it got so strange that it lost me.  Was it Patricia Arquette's oddly-placed nude (well, sort of) singing scene?  Was it Miranda Otto's questionable French heritage?  Rhys Ifans getting shocked over and over for his natural reaction to seeing a naked woman?  Probably, it was the overall effect of all of these things, and others like them. Taken all together, I never felt like the movie found its direction.  It's not so much that it lost me...just that it never really found me in the first place.

I like some pretty oddball movies sometimes, but 'Human Nature' might be just a little over the line even for me.  It's funny, it's got some good performances, and it's definitely an original.  My overall impression in the end, though, is that it's just... strange.

1799492,5,B0000714E6,"Men raised as apes. Mannered mice. Women with bad body hair days. Don't expect anything halfway normal in the ironically-titled ""Human Nature,"" the first collaboration between the brilliant Michel Gondry and even more brilliant Charlie Kaufman. Forget style above substance -- this is a thinking man's comedy, quirky and utterly hilarious.

It opens with a dead man, a convicted woman, and a genteel simian-man all speaking of their pasts: Lila (Patricia Arquette) became horribly hirsute when she was a teen -- by twenty, she was ""Queen Kong"" in a sideshow. Miserable, she retreated to the woods and became a reknowned nature writer. During electrolysis treatment some years later, a nurse offers to set her up with a desperate guy: Nathan Bronfman (Tim Robbins), a manners-obsessed scientist who is teaching them to white mice.

One day in the woods, Lila and Nathan come across a feral young man they call Puff (Rhys Ifans) -- as explained early on, Puff's father thought he was an ape, and raised his son accordingly. Now Puff is being taught the ways of humanity, as Lila tries to preserve the more primitive things about human beings -- and a warped love triangle results.

Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman recently collaborated on the wonderful, poignant ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" so it's not surprising that their first joint film was also excellent. It's the sort of film that can't be easily pegged as one thing or another -- part comedy, part satire, part blinking question mark. Is it human nature to be naked and free, to be civilized and uptight, or does it lie somewhere in the middle? Are we just animals in clothes, or do humans have something more... or less? ""Human Nature"" doesn't answer all these questions, but it does make you think about them.

Michel Gondry's quirky style -- he directed some of Bjork's best music videos -- suits this equally quirky movie. He keeps the movie jumping quickly from scene to scene, moving fast enough that you never get bored. And he seems like a kind of directorial minimalist (the afterlife is a white room with a white table and white mist). At other times, he takes slapstick to new heights, lightening up the cerebral tone of the comedy.

The surreal flashbacks and oddball comedy (like Ifans wearing a shock collar) give ""Human Nature"" cinematic style. But the characters are what really fill up the screen -- Arquette does an excellent job as the tormented Lila, particularly during a beautiful musical number in the woods. Rhys Ifans is even better, whether it's as an uncivilized ape-man, or as an eloquent, rather dapper ape-man.

Dorky scientists, civilized simians and hairy women sound like an idiotic basis for a movie, but Kaufman and Gondry transform it into a smart, strange comedy. Definitely not to be missed.",1107907200,5,2801,4.923728813559322
1799493,4,B0000714E6,"There is a point to what happens in ""Human Nature,"" but the key things to remember are that (a) the point will never be made explicitly and (b) the point is up to the beholder.  So if you need your points clearly and sharply made, then this film written by Charlie Kaufman is gong to befuddle you as much as anything he has ever written.  Since that includes ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Adaptation,"" ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" that would be a lot of befuddlement.

This film begins with the revelation that Nathan Bronfman (Tim Robbins) is dead, courtesy of a small round bullet hole in his forehead, and somewhere in the afterlife in a room where everything is white.  In prison is Lila Jute (Patricia Arquette), and testifying before some Congressional committee is a nattily dressed but strangely bearded man named Puff (Rhys Ifans).  Apparently there are issues about being ""sorry"" that this film will explain, but first we have to get up to speed on how this strange collection of characters came to be strange.

When Lila was 12 years old her hormones caused hair to grow all over her body.  Tired of being ""Queen Kong"" in a side show she goes off into the wild, writes a best selling book with a disparaging view of humanity, and, tired of shaving all over all the time, uses the money to have electrolysis to try and remove her hair.  Louise (Rosie Perez), who is doing the electrolysis, thinks she knows a guy who would be perfect for Lila.  This would be Nathan.

Nathan is a scientist.  As a boy he was taught the importance of table manners by his mother (Mary Kay Place) and father (Robert Forster).  Failure to use the right fork for eating his salad meant the young boy was sent to his room without supper.  So it is not surprising that today he is busy teaching a pair of white mice table manners.  As he explains to Lila, if he can teach table manners to white mice, then he can teach table manners to human beings, which would result in ushering in a golden age of good manners and civility.  Helping him in his lab work is the apparently smitten Gabrielle (Miranda Otto), who has decided the best way to come on to Nathan is to use a fake French accent.  Despite never having learned the correct film to use from either the wild or the dinner scene in ""Titanic,"" Lila and Nathan begin to go out together.  The key to understanding Nathan is to know his simple mantra: ""Remember, when in doubt, you should never do what you truly want to do.""

One day Lila and Nathan are out in the wood and they come up the feral creature that they bring back to civilization to study.  Gabrielle gets the honor of naming the creature and picks ""Puff.""  Nathan goes is not only to teach him about the silverware in a formal dinner setting but all other aspects of high culture.  He also wants to stop Puff from humping slide projections of sexy women, and in all of these endeavors uses the same shock aversion therapy that has worked so well with the two white mice (who do the best scene stealing by mice since the original ""Babe"").  But while Nathan is turning Puff from the Naked Ape into a sophisticated, debonair, man about town, he is torn between Gabrielle and Lila.  As for Puff, he would pretty much like to have whoever is left.

I would say that there are competing love triangles in ""Human Nature"" except that I am pretty sure Lila is the only one capable of love rather than lust.  But, of course, what these characters do is not as important as why they do it.  The problem is that since the characters do not seem to know why they are doing what they are doing, that makes it a bit difficult for us.  Nathan is always a step behind and Gabrielle goes whichever way the wind is blowing.  Lila is the most honest of the bunch, which means she is doomed, and Puff is caught in all of the middles of the circumstances developed in the film.  Puff also gets most of the good lines, from pointing out at the start that being raised by a man who thinks he is an ape is pretty much the same as actually being raised by apes to his recognition of a stage that exists before a beloved teacher takes a student from crayons to perfume.

I missed this film when it was first released but checked it out because I discovered after watching ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" that there was a movie scripted by Charlie Kaufman that I had missed.  Certainly ""Human Nature"" is the least of the films that I have mentioned here, but it is still indicative of the creative quirkiness that has made Kaufman's reputation.  I like films that make me think, even if I am not sure I am necessarily thinking what the film intends for me to be thinking in the end.  What I do know in this case is that the joke in ""Human Nature"" is on human beings, but then that usually is the case when you bring nature into the equation.",1098057600,6,4871,4.406703910614525
1799494,4,B0000714E6,"Almost as strikingly original as Kaufmann's other screenplays (""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation,"") what this film lacks is a director of Spike Jonze's mastery to bring it to the screen.  Michel Gondry while competent is not quite there yet, which results in a number of awkward, slow scenes and dead spots along the way---especially at the end, which turned embarassingly cornball until the last 10 seconds.

Tim Robbins, Patricia Arquette, and the yummy Miranda Otto all put in solid performances but again you get the feeling that all three would be capable of far better under a more talented director.  Robbins especially seems to be phoning his part in; he isn't asked for much, and delivers it.

The main saving grace of this film is its acerbic social commentary and gloriously jaded, anarchistic ideas regarding its title: ""human nature"" as well as the ""nurture"" (i.e. social programming) which largely mass-produces it.  The last second twist-ending is a nice cherry on top.

While certainly funny and entertaining especially during the first half, this is a movie I'd only rent, not buy.",1096761600,4,1103,5.1
1799495,4,B0000714E6,"Written by Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich), this film about a love rectangle is as quirky and insightful as one would hope.  With Patricia Arquette as a circus freak/nature writer, Tim Robbins as a researcher scarred by his childhood, Rhys Ifans as a young man raised as an ape, and Miranda Otto as a French lab assistant with a secret, this is a well-acted well-paced oddity that nevertheless makes consistently interesting observations about human nature.  If you enjoyed other films written by Kaufman, you will most likely enjoy this film, which is a bit quirkier but less bizarre than Malkovich.

DVD extras are: a trailer -- that's it!  The film can be heard in English or French with optional English subtitles.  Another worthwhile movie from the mind of Kaufman.",1090972800,2,777,4.992248062015504

If you want to see a film that operates as a piece of art, this film is for you.  Kaufman's quirky characters are wonderful & wonderfully played by this great cast.
If you don't want to think while watching a film, I recommend running away & watching some silly action film or teen comedy.
And be prepared for hairy naked women!
Great Film!",1081728000,,498,4.461538461538462
1799498,4,B0000714E6,"A unique film in every sense of the word.  If you enjoy Kaufman's other films, you should definitely check this out.  It may not be as funny as Being John Malkovich or as clever as Adaptation, but it is by far, one of the strangest films I have ever seen.",1079827200,,255,4.08
1799499,5,B0000714E6,"This was a completely unheard of movie from what I know, though it starred Tim Robbins, Patricia Arquette and Rhys Ifans (of ""Notting Hill"" and ""The Replacements"").
It's a strange story of ""human nature"" with some hilarious bits, some extremely strange situations, and bases ALL human nature on man's urge to fornicate.  (which is probably somewhat true, why do we write books, invent things, have jobs, etc?).
The main characters are Lila, Nathan and Puff.  All of whom have their little intricacies.  Lila (played by Arquette) is a former circus freak/nature writer, who's got a hormone problem that makes her hairy all over her body.  Nathan (Robbins) is a scientist with an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with regards to manners.  Puff (Ifans) is a man raised by apes, or more specifically, andother man who THOUGHT he was an ape.
The story then works to become a love triangle, or rectangle as it may be, as well as a quirky tale of Nature versus Nurture.  It's a VERY Spike Jonez feeling production and has quirkiness similar to that of Being John Malkovich, but it's a little BETTER in that it's more receptive to a larger audience.
There are some genuninely funny scenes and lines, but if you'd like to hear them or know them, you'll have to check out the movie.  If you liked Being John Malkovich, you should like this movie as it's got a comparable level of quirkiness to it yet remains comically sensible.  I haven't shown this movie to someone I've met who hasn't liked it, though I've noticed some terrible reviews for it.  If you're not sure, check it out.  It looks like you'll either love it or hate it.  At least it provokes some feeling either way.",1076371200,,1665,4.706896551724138

Even Herzog's similarly-themed Kasper Houser is better than this, and that's not saying much. At all.

Lyla was my favorite character in the movie... it was just too funny to see her shaving her whole body in the bathroom.  I was sad when she decided to change for the crazy doctor!  I thought Puff was hilarious--he did a great job playing the ape man!  The whole story line was laugh-out-loud funny, but from the very beginning you could sense the message about the ridiculousness of human nature.
