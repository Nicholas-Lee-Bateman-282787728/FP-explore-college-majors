8316740,2,B001KZTJ4W,"My 5 year old is taking Mandarin classes. I also have a three year old who picks up a lot of what the 5 year old learns. Since I do not speak any Mandarin, I started borrowing children's Mandarin DVDs from the library. So far this is the worst one. The sound quality is poor. There is a lot of screen time with no speaking or singing at all...just animation or images and background music (which is not traditional or modern Chinese music). Only a few words are spoken in Mandarin and each is repeated just a handful of times.

There is a narrative device (a young woman is out shopping, presumably in Chinatown in some city in the US, and is calling her dad to ask how to say various food words in Mandarin) but no real story. If you are looking for a video that is basically visual flashcards, you are better off with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Pim-Chinese-3-Pak-Volume-1/dp/B0010GWP2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Pim Chinese (3-Pak Volume 1)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Early-Start-Mandarin-Chinese-with-Bao-Bei-the-Panda-Volume-1-Colors-and-Animals/dp/B000G1TES2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Early Start Mandarin Chinese with Bao Bei the Panda Volume 1: Colors and Animals</a>.

Mei Mei basically ""teaches"" a lesson and then has songs and such at the end.

Our favorite so far, though, is one that actually has a story line:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Journeys-to-the-East-The-River-Dragon-King/dp/B001BZ9GRG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Journeys to the East: The River Dragon King</a>.

8316741,5,B001KZTJ4W,"The video is mixed with Chinese and English language with the panda bear speaks only chinese, and brown bear speaks only english.  They are good friends and play together and talks to each other in their own language.  It gives English speaking kids some comfort to watch because they can understand some context through English, and picks up some Chinese in the conversation.  It's fun to watch, and my little 3 years old wants to watch it again and again.  It's also enjoyable for adults to watch together with the kids.  I like it so much that I bought the 2nd Episode (Time to swim).  And it gets better.",1306022400,,608,4.532110091743119
8316742,2,B001KZTJ4W,"The purpose of this video is ostensibly to learn some Mandarin Chinese.  And there is some Mandarin spoken.  Occasionally they say the names of some fruit in Mandarin.  Stuff like that.

There is a cute dance sequence where no words are spoken--which doesn't seem like very efficient use of learning time when the objective it to learn language.

Nothing much is ever repeated enough times to really get what they are saying...except the counting.

Some words are repeated a little but not with enough context to associated it with either a real word thing or with an english equivalent.

My daughter (age 3.5) does want to watch it again and again.

What words has she learned from it?  So far, none that I can tell...she learns more from Kai Lan...but maybe over time.",1281571200,,770,4.7293233082706765
8316743,5,B001KZTJ4W,"Culture Cubs * Time to Eat!

My son loves this DVD. I bought it for him when he was 2 years old. He learned how to say the names of all the different foods rather quickly and with ease.  It is a 30 minute video with children of various nationalities speaking the names of particular foods in English and Mandarin. I used to watch it with my son and have picked up the Mandarin myself.

There are two characters in the DVD: one is a bear named Huckleberry, who speaks English.  The other is a panda named Xiao Long, who speaks Mandarin.  They are both good friends. The clips and music in the video make it fun and interesting. What I like is the DVD features real people and not 30 minutes of cartoon characters. The way it's done reminds me of some of my favorite PBS programs as a child. My son is 3 1/2 years old now and still enjoys watching it.

The set I bought was the Deluxe one, so it includes all the items pictured above. However, the Amazon price of USD19.99 is for the standard set, so only comes with the DVD. The only useful bit from the deluxe set are the *SNAP* cards. They are like memory cards (two cards with the same picture, except one card has the English word and the corresponding card has the Chinese characters as well as pinyin. Pinyin is the romanized spelling for transliterating Chinese.) The pinyin helps a lot if you are unsure of the pronunciation in the video. The rest of the items in the Deluxe set include a mini clip-on panda, stickers, and tattoos of the vocabulary words.

A year after I bought this DVD, I decided to buy the other two DVDs (Time to Swim & Time to Meet the Animals). I have to admit I was a bit underwhelmed. This is my favorite of the three. Time to Swim ranks second. If you are deciding which one to start with, I highly recommend starting with Time to Eat.

8316744,4,B001KZTJ4W,"It is a good educational DVD for young children. My 2 and 4 years old love this DVD series.
I don't know why I only got the DVD. I didn't get the panda, the stickers and the cards. I thought I would get everything shown in the picture.",1241654400,2,235,3.9166666666666665
8316745,5,B001KZTJ4W,"This video is so thoughtfully conceived and produced that it appeals to both of my kids, who are separated by 5 years. My older one, now a 3rd grader, studies Mandarin in school with a native speaker, but I would argue that he has learned as much from Culture Cubs, which emphasizes enunciation and does so in a fun, engaging way. We look forward to the other episodes in the series--would that more educational tools were this spot on.",1228089600,,436,4.531645569620253
8316746,5,B001KZTJ4W,"This 30 minute DVD is colorful, interesting and a fun introduction to Mandarin language focusing on food.  It has been the favorite DVD of my 15 month old for many months now and one that I can watch over and over happily myself. Colors, kids, food, dancing, creating food to eat and food as art, cartoons - it is all there and kids beginning from 1 year old seem to really enjoy it.  There are 3 in the series with the next one focusing on swimming and the most recent one focusing on animals.  They are all great.",1226793600,,515,4.23469387755102
