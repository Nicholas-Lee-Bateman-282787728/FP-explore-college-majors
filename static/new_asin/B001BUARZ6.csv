8284918,4,B001BUARZ6,"I don't know what tape the other reviewer watched, but it sure wasn't 'Charo's Kauai.'

THIS tape, which appears to date from the early or mid-'80s, is definitely set on the Garden Isle, and has plenty of local footage (actually pretty well-produced and shot, on video) of all the prominent sights, including (of course) Charo's dinner theater/restaurant. Charo also sings ""Under the Bamboo Tree"" (on the beach), strumming a ukelele.

As you would expect, it's all more than a little cheezy, but then we're talking about Charo here, so what would you expect? A must for her fans, as well as those who love the tropical beauty of Hawaii.",1342742400,,636,4.825688073394495
8284919,5,B001BUARZ6,"I love the VHS even though it was stated as Charo in Kauai ,it really isn't Charo in Kauai it's in Las Vegas I was hoping it was in Kauai since she lived there, all is good I can still enjoy the VHS.",1310947200,,199,3.6511627906976742
