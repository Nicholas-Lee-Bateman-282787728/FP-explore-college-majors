8356799,1,B0028S10ZG,"I get it, it is supposed to be intentionally dumb and to show off the naked ladies. This movie doesn't even muster a camp appeal. It is like a bad comedy skit no one wanted to be in or watch, extended to over an hour. Makes scenes of attractive nude bodies BORING, which is hard to do. Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad lighting, bad sound. One star for the soundtrack, which doesn't sound great because of the poor audio mixing, but the songs aren't that bad.",1449705600,,456,4.313953488372093
8356800,2,B0028S10ZG,"This had potential. Had the producers played it straight-up as a silly,  harmless  farce of horror films with much more  nudity (and better nudity), which is what I  had been expecting based on other reviews, this could have been good. It has a pretty strong female  cast for that,  though unknown Samantha  Carlson, who opens with a shower scene, is the standout  but gets killed off right away.

However, the movie has far  more  gore in it  than I had been led to believe.  Sometimes that  can  be silly,  ridiculous,  overdone and played  for  laughs--there are plenty of examples out  there. However, this adds an uncomfortably-realistic  level  of  violence to  the  gore and I would imagine that most  people  who are looking for  the sexiness wouldn't want to be surprised by finding the other  junk.

Even taking away that,  this movie is darn near  unwatchable.  The  writing  is terrible  (since this actually is a remake of  an  earlier picture you'd think that the producers would have had time to get it right)  with most of the supposedly funny lines missing their  marks.  Bad acting  is par  for  the course here  but  when you can tell that somebody in the cast is clueless as to how bad that he or she is, that makes things worse.  I refer in this case to the  punk  who plays the only male  employee of the ice-cream shop,  who spends the totality of the film  trying  to  imitate  Jim  Carrey as  Fire Marshall  Bill. Every time  that he  came on screen I either had to fast forward or mute. Ironically,  watching him was like taking  an ice pick to the skull.

There is  a  fair  amount of nudity,  but it  isn't well-done (basically all of it just toplessness, and nearly all of it from just one of the players--Asian brunette with a plastic-looking implant  job).  Don't buy this if you're looking for an eyeful; you WILL  be disappointed.

Actually I can't really give you a good reason to buy this.  There's a reason why it isn't more popular.",1388880000,,1969,4.530612244897959
8356801,2,B0028S10ZG,"The origional movie was called Ice Scream and it came out long before this one. Exact same plot, same charactors, only the origional had Conrad Brooks in it. I wonder why that one is not on dvd. I wonder why the total rip off?",1307059200,,226,4.159090909090909
8356802,1,B0028S10ZG,"I was hoping to watch a mindless, low budget flick for pure entertainment.  I was wrong.  This one was a true disappointment and it should be re-titled...""Hot Blood Silicone Sundae"".  I don't know about others, but I'm not a silicone fan, especially when the surgery is low budget, too.  I guess these ladies needed the dough...no talent whatsoever.  I feel stupid buying this one (for $2.34 used).  It has now taken up residence in my trash can.",1289692800,,446,4.7272727272727275
8356803,5,B0028S10ZG,"I bought this for Bobbi Billard.  I've seen her for years & never knew she could act.  Silly premise, silly characters, lot's of blood & tons of beautiful nekkid chicks.  Ever see an ice cream parlor in a warehouse with an industrial shower room & 3 blue lockers?  I hadn't either.  How about death by a waffle cone?  Maybe sprinkles & whip cream?
Silly premise:  Guy wants to turn a profit by having his already stunning workers wear less.  All the while there's an ice cream killer doing what he does best, kill the girls off one by one with different condiments.
Quirky & funny.  Enjoy it.",1275868800,5,592,4.457943925233645
8356804,2,B0028S10ZG,"This movie is great, if your looking for a soft core porn rather than an enjoyable horror film. I love over the top horror films to just sit back and laugh at, but this movie was horrible! Sure it had a couple lines in it that were pretty funny mostly because of the terrible acting, but for the most part the jokes were lame, the killings were boring, and since I was wanting to watch a horror film and not a porn the 3/4 of the movie where they just strip, dance and rub each other got old. Not recommended unless your just looking for an hour of boobs.",1259107200,,555,4.10091743119266
8356805,4,B0028S10ZG,"Hot Blood Sundae is very entertaining, B-horror comedy about an adult ice cream store and the stacked-and-sexy employees who work there. Some gorgeous actresses packed into very small outfits in this flick, including Bobbi Billard and Akira Lane. Also a ridiculous slasher/killer with an ice cream bucket on his head. Not bad at all if you like that sort of thing.",1253664000,6,364,4.983606557377049
8356806,5,B0028S10ZG,"I bought both Hot Blood Sundae and the alternate version Ice Scream the Remix, and let me tell you- they are both hilarious! What more could anyone ask for in a movie? There is not only unadulterated camp, buckets and buckets of blood, but exceptionally beautiful girls, and tongue-in-cheek humor that will have you in tears. Finally, a movie that deviates from the never ending line up of teen horror flicks with the same plot line and over-hyped releases. This is not the run of the mill ""teens go camping in cannibal infested/ organ stealing/ vampire ridden woods with the token..""oh no...I have no cell reception"" running in circles until only the plain-formerly geeky girl who discovered her inner strength after watching all her friends get disemboweled-drives back to civilization-with the slow pan up into the sky so we watch the car travel out of the backwoods onto the highway end scene"" that we get thrown every month or so by other companies. It's no coincidence that Bobbi Billard is shown prominently on the cover and the disk- she is by far the most stand out actress of the bunch. Bobbi plays her character well and looks damn good doing it, it's worth the price just to watch her alone.",1250035200,4,1203,4.733333333333333
8356807,3,B0028S10ZG,"Hot Blood Sundae has breasts. Lots and lots of breasts. Big Breasts. Small breasts. Fake breasts. Real breasts. They're all here. So why didn't I enjoy this movie more? Well, not even breasts can make up for a lackluster script and some stinky acting. Also, for a slasher movie the deaths are so lame and uninteresting. The movie kind of reminded me of a cross between Bikini Bloodbath and Jim Wynorski's Sorority House Massacre 2, only not as fun as either of those. Oh, but it has breasts. Did I mention that already?",1249948800,6,519,4.591397849462366
8356808,5,B0028S10ZG,"So I got my copy of Hot Blood Sundae and what can I say except this is a really fun movie.  Watched it with a bunch of friends and we laughed and had a really good time.  This movie has some of the hottest women including Bobbi Billard, Akira Lane, and to my surprise Joanna Hernandez.  She is the girl that won For The Love of Ray J on VH1.  She is smoking hot.  The movie has a lot of blood, funny jokes and some great music.  That really surprised me because this type of movie usually has really lame music.  The movie just rocks.  I fully recommend it.",1249430400,2,557,4.045871559633028
