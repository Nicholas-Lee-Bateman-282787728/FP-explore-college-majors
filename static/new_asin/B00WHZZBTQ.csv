7132368,1,B00WHZZBTQ,"i love ES and have since i first heard him in college in 1996. Don't confuse your love for his music with a crappy movie with unforgivably terrible  editing comprised of  mostly B reel footage that does little more than reinforce the negative stereotypes about him. I was apalled when the movie began focussing on his death. what other rock documentary focuses so heavily on the death of the artist before the story is even told?  yes, please flood my inbox with your oblivious noncritical fanboy comments.",1437436800,3,506,4.793103448275862
7132369,5,B00WHZZBTQ,"Elliott Smith may not be a household name but to his millions of fans all over the world, he is beloved and missed. This beautifully shot documentary is an amazing glimpse into the short life of Elliott Smith. I loved the intimate interviews with Elliott. Any Elliott fan will simply adore this film. Heaven Adores You is a lot like Elliott...humble, sweet, loving and beautiful.",1437350400,2,379,4.846153846153846
7132370,5,B00WHZZBTQ,"This is the film that Elliott Smith deserves, showcasing more of the amazing music he created and giving a glimpse of the very witty man that he was, rather than focusing on the drama of his life that has been told of far too many times. Nickolas Rossi and crew have put together a very respectful, loving and artistic tribute to Elliott, and hopefully it will spark a whole new legion of Elliott Smith admirers and fans.",1437350400,6,421,4.48051948051948
7132371,5,B00WHZZBTQ,I have been waiting to see this movie for over a year. When I finally got to I was not disappointed at all. What a beautiful done amazing film about this amazing artist. Top notch documentary. I am so glad this movie was made. Thank you.,1437350400,3,237,4.173913043478261

7132373,5,B00WHZZBTQ,"I watched this in theaters, and it was a great documentary on the music of Elliott Smith. I'm very much looking forward to the extended hour of bonus footage.",1435968000,4,158,4.482758620689655
7132374,5,B00WHZZBTQ,"I backed up the documentary 3 years ago on Kickstarter, and I don't regret it. I have seen it at the movies, and it's really great ! Highly recommended !",1435276800,5,153,4.133333333333334
7132375,3,B00WHZZBTQ,"I love Elliott Smith. Unfortunately, I don't think this documentary is the documentary he deserves.

The documentary is a chronology of highlights his music rise and career. It had interviews with friends and colleagues who knew him well spliced with various videos and photos of Elliott.  But I don't know what this documentary was trying to do. If it was an introduction to Elliott Smith it offered so little of the music he is known for. If it was for the die-hard Elliott Smith fans, it offered little insight beyond what we already knew. It tried to stay positive and did not touch on the darker side of the musician, thus to a non-Smith fan, you would have been surprised at the end of the film of his drug use and suicide. It's a shame, I really wanted to like this documentary, but I didn't learn anything new about the musician, his life, his motivation, his music. My roommate who didn't know who he was had his interest piqued, but did not come away with any thoughts or opinions on his music. This is regrettable since Elliott Smith was a brilliant musician. This documentary fails to have an target audience- new fans won't be introduced to his amazing songs, long-time fans won't come away with anything new.",1457222400,22,1222,4.626728110599078
7132376,2,B00WHZZBTQ,"A frustrating piece. As a serious fan, I found it lacking. Fifty percent landscape and cityscape shots. So many missing pieces, such as missing persons among the interviewees and a notable dearth of archival footage and complete songs (I could have cobbled together more from my old VHS and audio cassettes). As a biopic, it fails. But, as a celebration of his music, it fails just as much. I watched it with my girlfriend, who has little knowledge of Elliott or his music, and we both came away from it dissatisfied. If this isn't for the hardcore fans and it isn't for the newcomers, who is it for?

Elliott referred to his songs as impressions. If this documentary is attempting to create an impression of his life and/or music, it's the unfinished demo tape of a jam session. Elliott's music was lean and visceral. He deserves better than a movie that's so sloppily edited and emotionally empty.",1456617600,3,899,4.726114649681529

7132378,1,B00WHZZBTQ,"I saw an early screening of Heaven Adores You in Chicago where the director attended and fielded questions afterwards.  I was so excited for its release that I drove up all the way from Dayton, OH to see it.  Let me tell you that it was massively disappointing.  It's amazing how this director made a movie about Elliott Smith that failed to make you feel anything... not at all like his songs.  If you like random shots of trains, and helicopter views of the pacific northwest, then maybe this movie is for you.  There's also a decent amount of information in there about the dates Elliott moved from city to city.  This director did not put anywhere near enough energy into this movie that Elliott Smith deserved. It is a shame.  Almost a year afterwards now, I'm still upset about it.  One question he got at the screening asked: ""Why was there an absence of substantive information on the parts of Elliott's life that we know existed... depression, drug abuse, etc? The book Torment Saint was much more satisfying"".  The director replied: ""Yes, I bought that book, but have not had the chance to read it"".  If I was to make a movie about an artist's life I would at least take the effort to do the background reading.  To know about it, and to ignore it, is irresponsible.  Save yourself the disappointment. Also, don't give this director any money for his film,... for the sake of Elliott.",1456012800,15,1394,4.576612903225806
7132379,5,B00WHZZBTQ,"Anyone who has any interest in Elliott Smith should add this film to their collection. The filmmakers interview people who rarely grant permission to be interviewed, and they beautifully honor Elliott and his legacy. This film has been lovingly produced, and it shows through every second. Definitely worth the purchase!!!",1455408000,2,322,5.46
7132380,2,B00WHZZBTQ,"This documentary is just a discography. If you're dying to know where Elliott lived when he made Figure 8, this movie is for you. If you want a filmmaker who has the courage to dive into all the controversial and muddled pieces of Elliott's troubled life and his constant battle with depression and substance use, this ain't that.",1455235200,4,330,4.706896551724138

7132382,3,B00WHZZBTQ,"Yes, there have been books or maybe the occasional half-hour special on Elliott Smith. It was great to see a movie about him. It didn't really dig deep enough. As a huge fan; I knew most of what was mentioned in the.. documentary? It wasn't a biopic...was it? Love letter is an apt description, I suppose. There were a lot of instances where the people being interviewed could have elaborated on their respective stories. After two of those instances it was obvious in this particular film. He wanted to showcase Elliott's gift of music. Yes, he was a wonderfully gifted song writer and equally gifted at guitar. I was under the impression the movie would shine a light on the person that created the music. It just fell short of that for me.",1453334400,3,742,4.586466165413534

7132384,4,B00WHZZBTQ,"A great retrospective on a musician who died in his prime.  Don't go in expecting a serious dissection of  all things Elliott Smith.  This is a full gloves on celebration of the man and his music.  It is beautifully shot with Smith's songs perfectly complementing the urban scenery that frequently make up the film. Enjoyable as a fan of Elliott's music, but with only tiny glimpses of his life and the events that lead to his untimely death.",1449878400,2,442,4.628205128205129
7132385,3,B00WHZZBTQ,"It was nice to hear some of the music and get some background story, but it wasn't very well executed as a whole, more like a highschool media project, which some people may actually like. Very lo-fi.",1448323200,,200,4.4324324324324325
7132386,4,B00WHZZBTQ,"I adore Elliott Smith and have for years. He's my favorite solo artist and his music has touched my life beyond words. I thought this documentary did a pretty good job describing him and his music and life, but maybe could have been more detailed about a few things. It's a close 5 though, and definitely worth watching, especially if you're a fan of his.",1448064000,,355,4.476923076923077

7132391,5,B00WHZZBTQ,"Heaven Adores You is a lovingly made documentary that takes us on a journey of Elltiott's musical career from a young man in Texas to his rise in Portland to New York where his career blossomed as his life fell apart before he moved to LA in a tragic descent.

The documentary comes to life through old interviews with Elliott and through stories that those that knew him shared. Through happy memories and  thoughts that were obviously hard for his friends to share with us, Elliott came alive once again to touch our lives with his music.

The film wasn't about his death or his problems with drugs but was instead about who he was as a person. A entire film could be made about his life in LA. I couldn't help but feel that there were some big holes in the interviews or people I would have loved to see interviewed for the film such a few missing band mates, fellow musicians who were close to him and his parents. Some may have declined the offer but it left me feeling that there could have been some good perspective to have been gained from their insights.

I personally enjoyed hearing a few hard to find tracks from some of his hard to find projects such as Stranger Than Fiction and at by the time the documentary ended we are left with an impression of who he was and reminded of the hole that remains from what could have been.",1443484800,,1340,4.348

7132393,5,B00WHZZBTQ,"Just viewed this and it is an excellent tip of the hat to this great singer/songwriter. Very insightful. After I watched this I was inspired to revisit a wonderful DVD of Elliott performing in Seattle in 1999,titled 'YoYo a GoGo'.  'YoYo.....' is not a bootleg DVD. Screening copies were sent to critics (it was reviewed in Rolling Stone) but to my knowledge it was never released commercially. I don't know why as it is pro-shot and as I stated,it is a wonderful snapshot of E.Smith. Anyway,I recommend 'Heaven Adores You' to the E.S. fan and to folks just discovering Elliott.",1443312000,,578,4.78
7132394,5,B00WHZZBTQ,Loved it. I only wish it had been longer.,1443052800,,41,3.6666666666666665
7132395,5,B00WHZZBTQ,"The opening hook was amazing.  As a fan of Elliott Smith, I don't think I ever knew the person behind the music.  The opening let me know so much about him right off the bat.  It made me a bit sad that I didn't get to know this side of him until the film exposed it to me.  Also, the doc is a great tribute to Portland.  All the visuals are composited in such a way that it doesnt feel like B-roll or filler.  Portland is its own character.

To be honest, Im a bit overwhelmed at some of the emotion I felt while watching the doc. As someone who has struggled with depression, it was easy to empathize with Elliott.  He gave us the words that we couldn't find when we were sad really stuck with me.  That said it all for me.  Thanks for giving this gift and this message.  Many needed to hear it, and many still do.",1442275200,2,815,4.0

7132397,5,B00WHZZBTQ,"Nickolas Rossi put together this film, which is as quietly and thrillingly as touching as the music of Elliott Smith, the documentary's late subject. It explores his life, via old interviews with Elliott and fresh, candid interviews with friends and family. It starts with his childhood and progressing one major release album at a time, from Heatmiser's latter works to From a Basement On the Hill, the posthumously released tour de force.

Heaven Adores You also takes us from Portland, where Elliott was a local staple in his early musical years, to New York, and finally Los Angeles, where he died - and it's still undetermined whether or not it was a suicide. It shows the real, non-touristy parts of each city where Elliott based his music of the time, through the lens of Rossi's carefully choreographed shots. The cinematography is real. Throughout, the film is full, of course, of Elliott's music, and the song selections are perfect.

I'm watching Mr. Rossi's career with interest. He'll have a tough time topping a winner of a picture like Heaven Adores You.",1440892800,2,1069,4.933333333333334

7132404,5,B00WHZZBTQ,"A well crafted, throughly composed love letter to an exceptional voice in American music, Heaven Adores You succeeds most in not pandering to the sensationalism around Elliott Smith's last few years as a summation of his whole life. Instead, Director Nicholas Rossi gives us a well rounded experience of a life well lived and a creative force that has gone on to impact fans from around the world, and hopefully for years to come. Bravo. Finally. Elliott Smith can be remembered as more than someone who struggled with drugs and depression. While these themes are present in his life and career, and in this film, Heaven Adores You paints a much more interesting portrait of Elliott as someone who spoke for ALL of us.",1437696000,2,718,4.798387096774194

8713501,5,B00WHZZBTQ,"Good film... Focused a bit heavy on his hundred of hip friends basically talking about how he had no friends.  Cool to hear some of E-Dogg's childhood recordings.  Ummm... and it basically (started and) ended with XO and glossed over his ""crazy"" period near the end...  Nice to not define the guy as a druggie... But the biography's on Elliott do... and I'd be kidding if I didn't say that stuff wasn't more entertaining and more-worthwhile of someone's time than many of the un-eventful encounters in this movie.  I watched the film with an newbie and felt like she felt I suckered her into watching a boring ass documentary expecting to hear stories of him going to Mexico to hook himself up to urine filled IV's at the recommendation of Courtney Love... But nope, not here.  For a fan with multiple Elliott tattoos (ME!) it was great though. :)",1490054400,2,847,4.657718120805369
