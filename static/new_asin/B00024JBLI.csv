Even though the production quality is relatively low (by today's standards), the interviews with such notable guests as Julius Erving, Rick Barry, Bill Russell, Oscar Robertson and a number of others is very engaging.  The clips are only about 20 min each, and they are hardly what you would call comprehensive as far as detailing the individual athlete's career.  However, there is alot of great old footage (especially from the 50's and 60's) and some surprising opinions that would hardly be PC for today (check out Jerry West's interview if you want to know what I mean).  The most interesting items though are a slew of ""extras"" that are included in the DVD.  Although they are only the B&W newsreels from Ed Herily doing commentary, the items such as the 1961 NBA Championship, or the 1959 NCAA finals are great for reminiscing purposes.  Again, for those who are totally absorbed in the ""modern game"" or a production that is really refined, these DVD's will be boring for you.  But if you can name a backcourt of Sam Jones or Bob Cousy with a frontline of Bob Pettit and Elgin Baylor, then check these out (if you can get them for a reasonable price).",1344643200,3,1318,4.555084745762712
