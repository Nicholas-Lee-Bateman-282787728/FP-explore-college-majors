5374635,4,B00A0HT99G,"I enjoyed watching these stories back in the days before HD, DVD and Bluray affected viewing habits and probably even casting. The acting and stories are dated, but Francesca Annis is always worth watching. The stories have been well adapted from the series written by Agatha Christie.

5374637,4,B00A0HT99G,"I bought these dvd's in two boxed sets in 2003 and was hoping this product would be an upgrade in quality although it doesn't list it as such. It is the same quality as the earlier set - which is good but blu-ray spoils you. The advantage of this set over the earlier one is the dvds's are all in the same case (a flimsier case, with flip holders) and so it saves on shelf space, which is helpful when you are a collector of mysteries. For that reason alone, I am keeping this one and selling the earlier sets. If you want a sturdier set or already have the earlier one, there is no reason to buy this one. There are no extras. That said, Tommy and Tuppence are fun and it's Agatha Christie, after all. I like the Secret Adversary best.",1361577600,41,736,4.153846153846154

5374639,5,B00A0HT99G,"Agatha Christie crimes with Tommy and Tuppence as investigators.  The opening story is the feature film that shows the beginning of this sleuthing set. It's all a magnificent British Roaring 1920s costume mystery COMPLETE series that also includes 10 TV episodes. Beresford's, T&T, are the duo solving Christie short story tales. A funny, likable, proper British sleuthing duo, much like Agatha Christie's Poirot but as much humor as mystery. FUN!

The regular cast is Francesca Annis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cranford/dp/B00140PK6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cranford</a>, Lillie, Reckless) as Tuppence, spiffing in 20s hat styles.

Alert is a comic young assistant played by Reece Dinsdale, his first role in a strong continuing career. Arthur Cox (Jane Eyre) plays a Scotland Yard Inspector in episodes 1, 5, 6 & 10. Guest stars appear by the dozen.

ALL now with SUBTITLES
The Secret Adversary- 2hr film
Tommy and Tuppence meet in London, demobed after WWI.  Govt. man Carter (Peter Barkworth) employs them to locate a secret paper that survived the Lusitania.

Believable 1920s period, some film inside the Ritz.

I couldn't care less about the production values.  That's what all TV programs looked like at that time. These productions are very different from others in the genre (with the possible exception of Campion), including all made in the 70's right up to today.  I was surprised that they went for such camp, 'scenery-chewing' performances.

5374655,5,B00A0HT99G,"Finessing the King

Keep your eye on the queen of hearts

Agatha Christie's ""Finessing the King"" adapted by Gerald Savory.

Tommy Beresford (James Warwick) and wife/ assistant Tuppence (Francesca Annis) of the international detective agency are getting bored when Tuppence notices an anonymous advertisement in
The Daily Leader (local new paper.)

""I should go three hearts, twelve tricks, Ace of spades, necessary to finesse the king.""

Of course it is an obvious secret message. However being clever they figure that the message is some sort of rendezvous. It is to take part at the Three Arts Ball (costume ball) where one of the sleuths gets to dress up as Sherlock Homes and the other as Dr. Watson. One guess as to who gets to be homes.

After the ball is over, like most of the revelers, they go to xxx to have a drink an early breakfast. There they notice a man costumed as the local paper entering a private booth with a woman and coming out alone. We are way ahead of them on the plot

As with most of the ""Partners in Crime"" series we are fare ahead of them on the whom. The fun is to watch them figure out not only the whom but the other details. This story is a period piece of just after The Great War.

Made for TV and fairly transparent, this film still has all the ambiance of a BBC Agatha Christy production. It is a period piece and employs many major English actors. Detective Inspector Marriott (Arthur Cox) played the newspaper reporter Salcombe Hardy in Dorothy L. Sayers' Have His Carcase (1987).",1506297600,,1520,4.5625

5374698,5,B00A0HT99G,"Those having only a passing knowledge of Agatha Christie's body of work may be surprised that she penned recurring sleuths other than that mannered Belgian and the busybody spinster. Her third most prolific mystery solvers are Tommy & Tuppence Beresford, and they happen to be my most preferred choice in Christie's stable of clue wranglers. On the small screen, in 1982, these perfectly amiable amateur detectives-in-love made their mark with BBC's fantastic television film adaptation of The Secret Adversary, a recounting of their first ever caper. In 1983, BBC aired the Partners in Crime series which adapted Christie's second Tommy & Tuppence novel (or anthology, to be more precise). These are thoroughly polished endeavors as reflected in the glossy production values and how this bygone era of flappers and Charlestons and bee's knees and such are so convincingly evoked.

Unlike Christie's more somber yarns, these particular mysteries are distinguished by a lighter tone. Franscesca Annis and James Warwick bring to life the mischievous, inquisitive, fashionable Tuppence and the steady, sensible Tommy. Their spirited partnering produces a constant dose of amusing verbal jousting. And, boy, do they keep on trading these naughty half-smiles.

There's the all-important whodunit aspect, yes, but there's also the romantic element. Tommy and Tuppence's romance is a bubbly, effervescent thing. This sophisticated English couple practice a sexy kind of alchemy. They bring marvelous comic timing and an appealing air of self-mockery. Tommy and Tuppence would feel entirely at home hobnobbing with Nick and Nora Charles. Annis and Warwick showcased their playful chemistry in their earlier collaboration Agatha Christie's Why Didn't They Ask Evans? (first aired, 1980) wherein they're equally engaging as sudden sleuths Lady Frankie Derwent and Bobby Jones.

The Secret Adversary begins in the aftermath of the first world war. It finds longtime chums Tommy and Tuppence renewing acquaintances. Being two young things down on their luck, they decide, on a whim, to engage in a joint venture. They place an ad in the paper, keening for adventure. They promptly reel in a case, the gist of which has them striving to unearth the mysterious Jane Finn who may have in her possession a secret treaty of which publication could destroy England. But opposing our young adventurers is the brilliant criminal mastermind, Mr. Brown, who could be anyone and be anywhere. I have loved many an Agatha Christie conundrum. For sheer likability, The Secret Adversary sits very near the pinnacle.

I love the short story collection, Partners in Crime, near as much. In its opening salvo, ""The Affair of the Pink Pearl,"" several years have elapsed since the events of The Secret Adversary, and Tuppence is bored, bored, bored. She longs for adventure, or as her patient hubby Tommy puts it: ""This craving for vulgar sensation alarms me."" But, for the Beresfords, the doldrums are soon laid to rest as, for a six month trial period, they get a crack at running a down-and-out private detective agency, interchangeably called Blunt's Detective Agency or the International Detective Agency.

In the book/anthology version of Partners in Crime, each short story involves Tommy and Tuppence applying an investigative method favored by a (at the time) well-known literary sleuth. This conceit isn't as relevant in the TV adaptation, but there's still a whiff of good-natured parody lurking about in several episodes. So, for example, we glimpse a glimmer of Sherlock Holmes in ""The Case of the Missing Lady"" and Father Brown in ""The Man in the Mist."" In ""The Sunningdale Mystery,"" the Beresfords indulge in a bit of armchair detecting &agrave; la Baroness Orczy's the Old Man in the Corner. In ""The House of Lurking Death,"" A.E.W. Mason's ingenious French Inspector Hanaud (whom you will, of course, remember) is channeled. What fun! What gaiety! By the way, young Reece Dinsdale does very well as the exuberant, cinema-obsessed Albert, erstwhile bellboy become the Beresfords' indispensable butler.

Unlike plenty of literary detectives, the Beresfords were allowed to age. I only wish BBC had adapted N or M as well. Or The Postern of Fate. Two books that follow the Beresfords to, respectively, middle age and on to early dotage. And maybe that's why I relate more to these two than to Poirot or Marple. It feels like the Beresfords have lived a life. It feels, when we weren't reading about their daring escapades in Christie's books, that they carried on living, anyway. Or I like to think so.",1459123200,,4583,5.220108695652174

5374728,5,B00A0HT99G,"since not many authors manage to create TWO iconic characters, some might say that Agatha Christie met her quota with Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. well, Tommy & Tuppence may not be quite as famous as those two, but by all appearances they've built up just as rabid a following.
it's frequently compared to The Thin Man, suggesting that Tommy & Tuppence are the British Nick & Nora Charles. like most such analogies, that's a pretty good starting point but frankly an oversimplification. ultimately, it's not unlike suggesting that The Three Stooges and ZZ Top are interchangeable on the grounds that they're both trios.
the principle difference lies in the male half of the team. we meet Nick Charles as an ex-detective who ostensibly retired to get married but never quite managed to leave the job behind. conversely, Tommy Beresford is naturally conservative and as such a slightly reluctant adventurer. (after all, he does go on to become a button-down bureaucrat.) it is his friend and eventual wife, Prudence ""Tuppence"" Cowley, who sucks him into the game. Tommy proves to have a knack for adventure as well as more of a taste for it than he'd like to think, but he needs a nudge to get going.
Tuppence is more comparable to Nora Charles, having much the same mischievous spunk. the primary difference is that she is the driving force of this team. for all intents and purposes, she's the leader.
so yet another of Dame Agatha's continuities proves rich with potential. and it's potential largely met and lived up to. the casting of James Warwick and Francesca Annis proves inspired, and they literally sparkle with chemistry. that alone would make the series worth your while, since any series depends upon the chemistry of it's characters. but thankfully, this wasn't seen as an excuse to slack off on everything else. the period flavor is indeed flavorful, and the writing is invariably faithful to it's source material. what most sets Tommy & Tuppence apart from their Christie siblings is an element of ""screwball"" comedy, and the series balances that with the mystery admirably.
(i sometimes suspect the comparisons to The Thin Man have less to do with Dashiell Hammett's novel than with the film series starring William Powell and Myrna Loy.)
if there's an issue to be taken it's that it makes it less than halfway. first we get a movie of their premiere adventure, The Secret Adversary. then, from a year later, a series of ten short story cases. at this time they are invited to take over ""Blunt's International Detective Agency,"" actually a spy surveillance outfit. the series even took it's name from the book encompassing said period, Partners In Crime.
there are several stories from the book they didn't get to, and three novels left over as well. so why didn't they go all the way? one possibility is obvious: the Beresfords are unique in these literary continuities in that they actually aged. they're fresh in the 20s in The Secret Adversary, and well into their 70s at their ""last hurrah,"" Postern Of Fate. so it wouldn't be surprising that neither Warwick nor Annis felt altogether confident in their ability to pull the later stories off. one wonders if there might've been a tentative plan to revisit the characters once they'd themselves aged, in which case we can only speculate as to why it didn't pan out.
anyway, for the most part it's a delightfully frothy confection in the best tradition of Agatha Christie. fans of the Poirot and Marple series of recent decades will find Partners In Crime a more than worthy companion piece.",1428364800,17,3563,4.871499176276771
5374729,3,B00A0HT99G,"Agatha Christie's best known detectives are Poirot and Miss Marple but far from their only ones. The 1983-84 series, Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime followed the adventures of a lesser known detective pair Tommy and Tuppence (played by James Warwick and Francesca Annis).

Before the series began, an adaptation of the first Tommy and Tuppence novel The Secret Adversary aired as a telefilm and told of the first adventure of Tommy and Tuppence when they met after World War I in need of work and began their careers with an ad in the newspapers and found themselves involved case of international intrigue. The plot was superb with a lot of tricks and an amazing number of red herrings. The cinematography was great for the 1980s with a far better quality than the typical British TV show of the era.

The cinematography of the main series was more typical of the era which was a definite downgrade. The series finds a married Tommy and Tuppence taking over a detective agency and assuming the pseudonym of the jailed original owner of the Agency, Mr. Blunt while Tuppence pretends to be his confidential secretary, Miss Robinson.  The stories are set in the 1920s  and the producers do a great job creating a period feel, even on a limited budget. Annis carries the show in that regard, looking very much the fashionable 1920s woman in looks as well as her general manner.

The book upon which the series was based,  was a bit of a tongue in cheek look at popular detective fiction and that feel comes through with several tips of the cap to the great detectives while maintaining a light feel to most stories.  The pacing could be a bit slow with too much melodrama and lead to a resolution that was more than a little bit rushed.  There were some great episodes in the series, but some stinkers as well.  The best episodes in the series are arguably the last two, ""The Case of the Missing Lady"" (from a comedy standpoint) and ""The Cracker"" from a dramatic standpoint with ""The House of Lurking Death"" probably the weakest.

In the end, the series is worth watching because of the delightful performance of Annis and her chemistry with Warwick. While not a great show, like many other programs of bygone days, it will beat most of what's on television these days.",1427068800,8,2270,4.680904522613066

5374736,1,B00A0HT99G,"Whatever this is, it isn't what Agatha Christie created in her Tommy & Tuppence books.  There is  a whimsical, lighthearted aspect to those books.  But, in trying (and failing) to translate that to the screen, both the actors and the director failed miserably.  The characters behave in such an absurdly facetious way that it made me cringe.  And there should be a law against over-acting to this extreme.  It begs the question of where the director was in all of this.  Both of the lead actors have given fine, measured performances in other shows, which suggests that they were directed to go over the top in this way; in fact, not just over the top, but over the top and out of sight.

At first I laughed, not at the story but at the appalling acting.  But finally, I just turned off the DVD player and put the discs back on the shelf.

If you like the Marple and Poirot series and are considering buying this based on those -- don't do it!  Save your money.

Tommy and Tuppence are English - of course - and they get involved in a series of investigations almost accidentally. The books are delightful and so are the actors who portray the couple. The crimes are original and the solutions don't come easily but require the pair to stretch their minds and, in some cases, their imaginations.
The problem: This was an early effort by the BBC and it suffers from poor set design, sometimes just-not-quite-right lighting and poor reproduction on DVD. It's good but not up to par with the current ""Poirot"" and ""Miss Marple"" efforts and a long, long way from ""Sherlock.""

5374780,5,B00A0HT99G,"My wife and I adore this series and they seem to be the BONNIE AND CLYDE OF THEIR DAY---only they are on the Right side of the law. How delightful are the costumes.

5374783,5,B00A0HT99G,Lighthearted Agatha Christie mysteries in the 1920's. Lots of period dress and 'roaring 20's' British scenery and situations. Nice little addition to any Agatha Christie fan's library.,1378252800,15,184,5.851851851851852
5374784,4,B00A0HT99G,"These shows are fun to watch.  The Tommy and Tuppence Mysteries are not my favorite Agatha Christie mysteries, but I felt it is well worth the money to get them.",1375574400,,161,4.366666666666666
5374785,2,B00A0HT99G,"My wife had read the Tommy and Tuppence stories years ago and so was eager to view these dramatizations. Sadly, the productions are rather disappointing. The actors are engaging and the costuming is nice to look at, but it all quickly devolves into self-conscious reveling in a faux-Twenties setting. The first episode, which dramatizes the novel which introduced the pair of sleuth, is a confused and almost incoherent mess. Later installments are more focused but still fall largely flat. A minor technical point is that these were made back in the years when BBC dramatizations such as this employed video for interior scenes and film for exteriors, leading to subliminal discontinuity when matters shifted between inside and outside. Anyway, that's a minor point, paling beside the shortcomings of the scripts themselves. Some might enjoy these out of a sense of devotion to Agatha Christie or for the sake of nostalgia or period era affectation. Viewed from my subjective perspective, these productions are simply boring.",1375315200,10,1026,5.262195121951219
5374786,5,B00A0HT99G,"Agatha Christies ""Partners in Crime: The Tommy & Tuppence Mysteries"" will delight you with the sparkling dialogue, beautiful costumes and clever stories so beautifully presented in this series of eleven adventures starring Francesca Annis and James Warwick. These two actors will bring to life Blunt's Detective Agency as a believable fixture of the fabulous 1920s in London. The range of stories and the variety of settings and personalities cannot fail to interest you.",1375056000,31,471,5.465753424657534
5374787,5,B00A0HT99G,"These 2 are an absolute treat to watch! They are delightful together and although these are mysteries, they aren't dark or heavy as others might be, especially for Agatha Christie. They are suitable for all ages. The actors themselves are excellent, the costumes are divine. Definitely a great addition to anyone's DVD collection. Think of Tommy and Tuppence as a lighter, summery version of the Miss Fisher's Mysteries, another series on DVD that I definitely recommend.",1374796800,2,471,5.2105263157894735
5374788,3,B00A0HT99G,"We have all the Agatha Christie movies, and were disappointed with this set.  The best way to describe this is ""unreal.""  Not quite what one expects with Agatha Christie.",1372377600,,170,4.827586206896552

5374790,4,B00A0HT99G,The Agatha Christie characters are brought to life in this series. However at times they seem to be acting a play instead of a movie which is a little stilted.,1371081600,2,159,4.333333333333333

5374792,4,B00A0HT99G,"I had so looked forward to getting this series,  I found the two main characters charming.  The clothes Tuppence wore were beautiful, and the hats were to die for.  But the series had little to do with the mystery side of the show.  While it was entertaining, I would much preferred it would have dealt with  the crime, and  less with them clowning around.",1369094400,2,356,4.484375
5374793,3,B00A0HT99G,"This was passable but certainly not close to the Poirot series in quality.  Here the acting was uneven as were the scripts, at time delightful and at times -- not.  As a fan of Agatha Christie I could not pass this up and on that basis I was glad I purchased this.",1368662400,2,264,4.0576923076923075
5374794,4,B00A0HT99G,"I enjoyed these Agatha Christie stories.  The earlier performances in the set were great, but as Francesca Annis began to ""vamp"" the character, Tuppence, in the later episodes;  It became less interesting to watch.",1368144000,,214,5.264705882352941
5374795,5,B00A0HT99G,"Start with the story.  Christie's stories are always elegant and suspenseful .  Then take the character development.  Again, Christie does it so well.  Add a polished cast and stunning settings and you have countless hours of quality entertainment.  These are the works which my wife and I like to view and re-view... pure pleasure. Particularly enjoyed the fact that we got so many hours of viewing for such a reasonable price.  Great value!

We were given fair notice of a few minor technical glitches when the older film version was meshed with the DVD technology, but it was hardly noticeable.",1366675200,2,597,4.91
5374796,5,B00A0HT99G,"I watched Tommy & Tuppence on Mystery years ago and always enjoyed it. I have been watching for this series to turn up, timed it just right for a new search and got the new set. I was pleasantly surprised to find a few I hadn't seen the first time around.

5374798,5,B00A0HT99G,It is wonderful to watch a series which was written by one of the greatest mystery writers of all times. The acting is superb and a joy to watch.

5374801,5,B00A0HT99G,"Partners In Crime is one of my favorite Agatha Christy series.  Amazon has done a good job of packaging the 11 mysteries in this collection and in making the collection affordable.  Even though I'v seen all of the programs at least once, they're so entertaining that I am  enjoying watching them again.  Amazon says that the age of the programs prevents them from being really HD, but the video quality is certainly acceptable. the main female actress Francesca Annis, is one of my favorite stars.  She is consistently delightful.  This series is a welcome counterpoint to current ""thrillers"" that focus on gore, car chases and suspense at the expense of totally losing sight of the most entertaining aspects of ""old time"" mysteries.  I highly recommend this series for enjoyable light entertainment.",1363651200,32,800,5.061068702290076

But, please do not order the new one with the other actors, the actors may be okay but the story line and time-lines are completely different.  I could not even watch 15 minutes of the remakes.  Whom ever is in charge of the new Christie mysteries is an awful muddled injustice to Christie and her mysteries.  Stick with Suchet, Hickson, and these 2 for Christie's mysteries on screen.....",1522454400,,580,4.443396226415095
8545898,5,B00A0HT99G,"Francesca Annis is a superb Tuppence!!  If you've read Christie's stories, you probably will agree with me about this.  And, Annis is simply gorgeous.  A stunningly elegant actress.  These tales are all reproduced from the TV broadcast, so some of the quality may seem rough and possibly uneven.  Don't worry - you will still enjoy watching these two fine actors and the entertaining supporting cast bring the tales to life.  And, the fashions, too, will probably even for the guys who watch these DVDs be eye-catching.
A great diversion for those days when you'd rather watch a story instead of reading one.",1520812800,,608,4.911764705882353
