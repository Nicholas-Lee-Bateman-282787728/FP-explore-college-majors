5063706,5,B0078XH6FE,"If you are into animes about magic or vampires, this anime is definitely one that I would recommend.  It is truly one of my favorites, and I really loved watching it when I first saw it.  If you're into it, go and get it!!!",1390003200,,223,4.045454545454546
5063707,5,B0078XH6FE,Oh my gosh it was just so amazing getting this complete set instead of just the one and two volumes on their own. If you love Vampire Knight why not get this as a gift for one of your friends...or an unexpected gift to yourself!,1379462400,,228,4.088888888888889
5063708,5,B0078XH6FE,"Purchaseed for teenage son. He says 'The story just grabs you and won't let go. Classic animae with well developed characters.""",1379116800,,127,5.095238095238095
5063709,5,B0078XH6FE,"It showed up before I could even think about it. I was extremely pleased.  I hate writing reviews and am taking the time to write one, if that tells you anything.",1368748800,,162,4.225806451612903
5063710,5,B0078XH6FE,"To be honest I lost my dvd remote so I can't go to the set up menu but when I stuck it in the player it actually has both subs and dubs going at the same time. It's a little akward plus it's kind of annoying! It could be just a problem with the set up & with me losing my remote well we will see when I dig out my remote or try at another dvd player. Hopefully it can be changed. Otherwise the quality is decent & I love the anime!

So I dug out my remote... buried in my kids room. The problem was fixed in the set up menu! So definitely worth the buy!",1368662400,2,553,3.6864406779661016
5063711,5,B0078XH6FE,"I love vampires and I've read all the books.  So when I found out there was a movie of it, I just had to have it!",1363824000,,113,3.3461538461538463
5063712,5,B0078XH6FE,"the dvd was awesome,and it was everything that was advertised. i was definitely pleased with my purchase. you can be sure i'll be back!",1361836800,,135,4.666666666666667
5063713,4,B0078XH6FE,"I've loved this anime for a really long time but only recently decided that I liked it enough to buy the set.  As a whole this is a good version, though there are some flaws in the English subtitles.  My only real complaint is with the second season/disc, I'm not sure what the problem is, and I don't recall this happening the first time I watched this series, but the panning shots are glitchy, moving in bursts rather than one fluid pan.  Still, it isn't too big of an issue for me though it might bother others.",1353888000,4,515,4.288659793814433
5063714,5,B0078XH6FE,This is an awesome anime. Good story and lots of action. I wish they wouldn't have cancelled it. They ended it at a pretty good place though so you don't really feel like you're missing too much. All in all a great buy.,1353024000,,219,4.116279069767442
8512431,5,B0078XH6FE,The best series!!,1451347200,,17,5.0
8512432,1,B0078XH6FE,The case and DVDs are great and look good but it is not English dubbed at all its in Japanese all you can change on it is the subtitles,1441324800,,135,3.689655172413793
8512433,4,B0078XH6FE,Disks don't stay in the DVD case but all after its very good,1429833600,,60,3.6923076923076925
8512434,1,B0078XH6FE,"This is FAKEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!! I mean look at the quality...theyre just copying the downloaded anime into CDs. China/Korean made.........I mean look at it, the JAPANESE characters are wrong where it translates Vampire Knight. Even I can distinguish the wrong charcters w/ just high-school 2 yr Japanese class.omg, i see so many fake ones on amazon. This is scary and NOT RIGHT.",1409097600,,381,5.366666666666666
8512435,3,B0078XH6FE,"Vampire Knight is fantastic and this arrived at my house much sooner than I expected. However, this is not at all high definition and if you try to skip a scene, you will skip an entire episode",1408406400,,193,4.243243243243243
8512436,1,B0078XH6FE,Do not buy this set. It is a bootleg produced on China.,1407456000,,55,3.6666666666666665
8512437,5,B0078XH6FE,"The story is gripping and pulls you in right away, I have no complains there. But the product itself could be of better quality. I purchased my DVD English dubbed version a little over a month ago and the sound quality is already deteriorating from frequent viewing. Season one and two are divided equally onto two DVD discs. The first disc during the first few weeks played quite well. What is always noticeable, distracting, and incredibly annoying is the glitchy pan movement of the camera in most of the episodes of season 2. It really can take you out of the story, and if you suffer from migraines or just don't like the feel of being dizzy, this could be a more than reasonable deal breaker.

I suppose it says something about the worth of the anime; beautifully crafted, inspiring soundtrack, compelling story line, that despite the season 2 disc glitches I've kept watching, over and over and over again. However now that both discs are showing signs of degradation I'm really wishing there was a Blu-ray version to pick from. I would recommend buying this with caution. If you can find a Blu-ray version you might be able to avoid the technical issues, if not you might want to wait and just continue to enjoy the series while it's on Netflix, completely free of technical glitches.",1407369600,,1292,4.691629955947136
8512438,1,B0078XH6FE,"I would strongly caution against buying this set.  The official region 1 complete season 1 & 2 set was only JUST released by Viz.  In fact, this is probably a region 0 set made for selling worldwide (and that's why it has Chinese subtitles).  One review mentioned that all content is on 2 disks - a common bootlegging technique to save money, and which can significantly reduce quality.  Here is the official release:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampire-Knight-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B00JVVFM3O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampire Knight: The Complete Collection</a>",1406678400,,616,6.6625
8512439,5,B0078XH6FE,"Came with all the episodes on two discs as advertised, no real issues. The second season was slightly choppy at times like a few other reviews said, but not too bad. Would recommend this to others to purchase :)",1404086400,,211,4.435897435897436
8512440,4,B0078XH6FE,the set has all 26 episodes on two disks but in the box there is space for Four disks but other then that i'm happy,1391385600,,115,3.64
