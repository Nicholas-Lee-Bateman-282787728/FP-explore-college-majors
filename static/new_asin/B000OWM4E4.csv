8187054,5,B000OWM4E4,"Expert trainer and practitioner with great material. Very practical material presented well. Execution is exceptional. Hernandez appears down to earth. Includes 2 DVD's. Bought this to replace VHS version because I found it so impressive and useful. Maybe more beneficial to someone with martial arts background and a good instructor or partner to practice with and perfect. Probably best absorbed by students of Hapkido or various styles of Arnis / Kali. Hernandez showcases his skills which are surprisingly good, despite his connection to the questionable Vee Arnis lineage. Includes bloopers section that illustrates realistic attitude of demonstrators.",1286928000,3,657,5.783505154639175
