8067096,1,B0009UVBRW,"I bought this budget DVD used hoping to receive at least a passable compacted history of The Great War. I know very little of WWI apart from something about an assassination at Sarajevo and mustard gas, so I hoped a budget label DVD [Eagle Media] would give me an idea of what the war was about and if I wanted to add more prestigious DVD releases to my collection.

What I got was a potted, disjointed, blandly read narration over a lot of very poor quality stock footage (which is never referenced and rarely had anything to do with the narration) all accompanied by an endlessly repeating snippet of music from Elgar.

The DVD cover promises ""Gripping Drama,"" ""Complex Characters"" and ""True Stories."" This DVD delivers on none them.

I give this item one star only for presenting historical footage I've never seen before; otherwise, I would advise viewers to avoid this poorly produced waste of money.",1220140800,5,905,4.751592356687898
8067097,3,B0009UVBRW,"It's a good documentary, well organized, but the sound is dreadful. The added (and unnecessary) sound effects are so loud that they often drown out the narrator's voice, and the distortion in some places is very bad. I know that it is a bargain-priced item, but the producers should have done a better job.",1173830400,7,306,4.685185185185185
