4213366,5,B003WEAW18,"I highly praise LARKRISE TO CANDLEFORD, but I cannot do it better than the 5-Star reviewers have done before me.  I must say that they have told you what I would have told you, if I had their writing ability.  I had read, and reread Flora Thompson's trilogy of semi-autobiographical novels long before there was a series.  I was skeptical that a television production could match the imagery held in my mind after reading the books.  I, and my husband, have been so pleased with the BBC interpretation, which does not follow Ms. Thompson's stories exactly, but which certainly represents them in the spirit they were written.  The cinematography is award-winning.  As Dusty Rhoads says in his review, ""every frame looks like a painting...""

For all who loved LARKRISE and will miss it, the DOCTOR FINDLAY series will delight you -- if you can find it.  I put my 5-piece collection together over a period of time, and it has delighted and charmed my husband and me.  Again, I will quote Dusty Rhoads, because it so perfectly fits the DOCTOR FINDLAY series, also:  ""...you feel like you're a fly on the wall watching REAL people with real emotions, real interactions, real losses, real senses of humor, real relationships...""  You will come to love the characters in DOCTOR FINDLAY, and will miss them when the series ends.  The DOCTOR FINDLAY series (that I own) are not numbered, but in order of production they are 1. WINNING THE PEACE; 2. A DELICATE BALANCE; 3. NO TIME FOR HEROES; 4. DAYS OF GRACE; 5. SNOWBLIND (a 1 hour special, ending the series).  There are 27 episodes totaling 21 hours. Unfortunately, the episodes do not have subtitles; fortunately, we rarely needed them.

Now, I am off to watch ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL, season 2.",1304899200,19,1747,4.760797342192691
4213367,5,B003WEAW18,"I've reviewed each of the 4 sets in detail. All excellent period drama. One of the best series ever produced, as a matter of fact. But the ""collection"" price is strange at $134.49 (today's price).
Sets 1,2 & 3 sell for 30.99 with 4 at 26.49 for a total of:
119.46.
Why is the combined set worth more? Buy them separately on Amazon and SAVE $$$.

English country life could never have been as poetic, pictorial, and enchanting as this dramatization of the lives of those living in and around the two 1880's towns of Lark Rise and Candleford. Even the DVD's music puts a sanguine sugarcoating on the period. All of this is to the delight of the viewer of this masterfully done TV series sure to endear any North American who has a tender video heart toward Victorian Britain. Each episode has multiple plots so it is impossible to break down the episodes into short summaries. And with carryover from one episode to another, it's more like moving to Lark Rise or Candleford and living with the good people (and the bad). A delightful scenic experience even Disney has never matched. Every emotion you have ever felt in your past will be repeated sometime throughout this English town saga.

Subtitled. It is romance, nostalgia, saga, suspense, drama, well...it's a cornucopia of viewing that is not to be missed. It continues with a great and large nucleus cast, but the stories and depth of characters grow with the show's movement. Darling Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan), Lark Rise born, was sent to Candleford to learn the trade of postmistress. She is the spark caught between the two towns (sometimes world's different.) Her mentor is Dorcas (Julia Sawalha.)
The cast is an assortment of either the die-hard, disheveled, working class or the Candleford higher class, shy of nobility range. Cast individuals make this memorable.  Also, be warned. Expect belly laughs too. Those Pratt sisters, Twister (OK tears too) and wife, Queenie, not to mention, Thomas the Bible-quoting, bike-riding, mail-deliverer, and his wife, Margaret could put together a comedy show every bit as good as this dramatic series has been--from day one. There is an abundance of fine British dramatic programming available, but this has to be one of my favorite.

Watch them in order. It's worth every wee farthing.",1304726400,124,2292,4.899484536082475
4213368,5,B003WEAW18,"If you've ever wanted to turn on the television and be thoroughly uplifted, entertained, touched, made to laugh, possibly even inspired, and, generally, just allowed to escape and be pulled in to a very good story...time and again, each and every episode, then don't look any further than the 'Lark Rise' series.  My wife and I are in our late 20s/early 30s, and this is easily the best program we have ever watched.  Hands down.

As the previous reviewer eloquently said, it is excellent family viewing, but ONLY because it's naturally wholesome, clever, fun, beautifully shot (the cinematography is truly breathtaking -- each frame looks like a painting from this period), handsomely scored, and all of those other attributes she mentioned -- it doesn't ""try"" too hard to fit into the family genre -- it just naturally fits.  So much of ""family entertainment"" seems like it was put together by a committee who are very fickle and trendy, as if the committee's #1 goal and bottom line was to ensure to appeal to the ""flavor of the month"" themes in entertainment (Where's the originality in that?).  THIS show, on the other hand, was clearly written by those who recognize the enduring and universal themes of family, friends, community, love, and basically, the things that make a memorable, good story -- the kind of story that brings you back for more.

The acting is superb.  The Brits seem to have this natural ability encoded in their genome.  You don't even feel like you're watching good actors -- you feel like you're a fly on the wall watching REAL people with real emotions, real interactions, real losses, real senses of humor, real relationships...oh, it's so refreshing.  One of the only other television series that comes close to the superior quality of LRtoC are the ""All Creatures Great and Small"" series (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Creatures-Great-Small-The-Complete-Collection-Repackage/dp/B003DUBAZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Creatures Great & Small: The Complete Collection (Repackage)</a>) another family favorite which also happens to be a BBC production, starring Robert Hardy (of ""Harry Potter"" movies and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sense-Sensibility-Special-Edition/dp/0800141660/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sense & Sensibility (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;fame).

Having the time to write a review for products you really appreciate, and to do it some justice, takes time I wish I had more of.  As they say, you vote with your dollar, but you also vote with your time.  So, I've cast in my vote!

I hope that many others will be introduced to this excellent program about the many charmingly told comings and goings of two Oxfordshire communities, and the individuals who lived there (in Flora Thompson's memoirs), set in the late 1800s.  I only wish that more seasons were in the works, but I am indeed grateful for what they have made in these four seasons.  Many of our home videos in our collection we grow tired of after a few viewings.  However, I know that ""Lark Rise to Candleford"" will be a rare treasure in our household for years, if not decades.",1303689600,217,3182,5.42393509127789
4213369,5,B003WEAW18,"Charmingly entertaining, this series is a wholesome delight to the vintage senses, from darling start to sudden finish. (The only true downside being that this series was just stopped short at essentially a half of season four - for some strange and unanswerable reason, having absolutely nothing to do with and seemingly ignoring the fact that the show has enjoyed very high ratings and passionate fans in the UK - to the US and beyond.)

I discovered this engaging series about a year ago and was entirely thrilled to have stumbled upon it. I couldn't watch every episode of the first three seasons fast enough and then promptly watched every show once more at a more leisurely and enjoyable pace. I couldn't wait for season four to arrive this year and have recently seen every episode once (and I'm about to watch them all again for the second satisfying time). I'm glad that many storyline threads were wrapped up quite nicely at the end, but still wish this series had continued through the few more seasons that it was meant to be in the first place. (Could fans bring this back in any way any time soon - either side of the pond - maybe a co-production?!)

Adorned with lovely late Victorian dresses and details, complete with wonderful actors and their perfect performances, abounding with cute and quirky characters running the gamut from silly to snarky to sweet: this series of episodes (in basically three and a half seasons) offers plenty of thought-provoking and interesting themes while it evokes smiles, laughter and even some tears (at least to the sensitive of heart).

The women I know who have seen it have loved it like I do, and even some men I know have watched and enjoyed it too. This series is certainly family fare. There is plenty to think about... Poverty contrasting against monetary ease. A poor hamlet sometimes in contest with a thriving town. Class structure. Old traditions versus new ideas. Neighborly and not always so very neighborly folks. Human nature and divine beliefs. Conservative thoughts opposing liberal views of that late nineteenth century day. Religion and politics, business and love. It's a cornucopia of fulfilling fun.

Miss Lane and young Laura each fall in love their several times throughout, as they both think on marriage: to be or not to be. Many families and individuals take their turns facing their financial troubles and personal challenges. Characters of many types come and go within the storylines. There are wise women, careless ones, loveable but flawed individuals, caring parents, good and bad fathers, and the list goes on. Many of the actors were gone too much or too soon for my tastes. One thing for sure: what I've seen has left me wanting more; but I will thank my blessings and enjoy what was done of this wonderful series.",1299024000,373,2802,4.843423799582464

4213391,5,B003WEAW18,"I fell in love with this series back in 2008.  It is one of the best period dramas produced.  I'm glad I was able to find the complete set on Amazon and at a very reasonable price.  I binged watched it during the Thanksgiving holiday.  And have since lent it to my sister to enjoy.

4213430,5,B003WEAW18,"Lark Rise to Candleford.  I like this 40-episode, 2008-2011 BBC series so much that I purchased it and plan to see it over again, perhaps many times, as well as share it with my friends.  It is based on Flora Thompsons semi-autobiographical novels set in Oxfordshire at the end of the 19th Century.  In her teens, Laura Timmins leaves the hamlet of Lark Rise for a job in the market town of Candleford, where her mother's cousin, Dorcas Lane, is postmistress. Life centers around the post offce.  We get to know well about a dozen characters and meet others who come and go.  The series deals with personal and family issues as well as conflicts between various factions that arise.  The scripts are as fine as I have ever seen, the acting superb, the setting and costuming top-notch.",1500076800,7,784,4.644927536231884

4213436,1,B003WEAW18,"I do not understand anyone giving this series an encouraging rating.  I usually enjoy English/Scottish/Irish series - but this is just boring!  Characters are not interesting ....plots are predictable and always sunny in the end.  Couldn't make myself like or dislike any of the characters enough to care what might happen to them.  Thank goodness Mr. Bates was able to find better employment at Downton!!  If you enjoy, as the commercial says...season 1 episode 1 - you will be disappointed.",1494201600,,492,5.1
4213437,3,B003WEAW18,"And idyllic it was, if this series is to be taken seriously. Daytime scenes are filmed in sunny, warm earth tones; interior and nighttime scenes are incredibly well-lighted; every dwelling is clean and spacious; everyone is well-scrubbed, well-fed, nicely coifed, clad in freshly washed clothes, and possessed of perfect teeth (a character had only to smile to bring me jarringly back to the present). The stories are very much in keeping with the sanitized, often cartoonish, characters that populate them. Each episode features many precious and teachable moments, and lest we miss the moral of the episode, Sarah Lancashire speaking as the heroine as an adult summarizes it at the closing in a voice-over. The material would have worked much better as a 90-minute feature, but as a series of over 30 hours length, the effect, on me at least, was similar to that of a diet solely of desserts: after a few episodes, I found myself craving something savory. (My wife, for whom I purchased this, and who insisted that I too watch it, loved the series; hence my rating of three stars rather than two.)",1493596800,,1099,4.882352941176471

4213526,5,B003WEAW18,"I first came across this series on Netflix.  After watching a couple of episodes, I was hooked and then came to Amazon looking to purchase the entire series.  This is one of the best series I have ever watched.
It starts out with a young girl, Laura Timmins, being sent away from her home in Lark Rise to work in the Post Office in Candleford.  The woman who runs the Post Office is not only a cousin to Laura's family, but she is also a very strong, single woman whom all the people in Candleford (and Lark Rise) look up to for advice and for inspiration.  The postmistress is played by Julia Sawalha (probably better known for her role as Lydia Bennett in 1995's Pride and Prejudice).  For Downton Abbey fans, you also will get Brendan Coyle (Mr. Bates) as Robert Timmins, Laura's father.
For those in the U.S., I liken this show to a cross between Little House on the Prairie and Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.  It's about strong women in the late 19th century, which was a time in which women were not supposed to be strong.
Once you start watching this series, you will be hooked and look forward to the next episode.  Unfortunately, there are only 4 seasons and it ended far too soon.",1479081600,,1186,4.412844036697248

It was a fun buy cuz now I have it to re-watch any time. I have loved getting to see it and study the characters..and they always turn up in other BBC productions which is also fun.  This series takes you through a time of incredible change in England, as the industrial revolution was just beginning to change how villagers lived and worked.

4213578,5,B003WEAW18,"This adaptation is loosely based on Flora Thompson's trilogy. They include many of the characters from her novels and some not in her novels at all, so to tell the story they have not stuck faithfully to the narrative. They often attribute events to others rather than the one the book credits and the Candleford relatives are missing from the story here. Miss Lane is 50ish in the book, whereas Julia Sawalha's Miss Lane is much younger to be sure. This is to be expected from any screen adaptation though,  and I really found this series charming.

4213625,5,B003WEAW18,"Please accept my review from the heart not so much as from the head. I watched a few episodes & I wasn't particularly impressed at first. Forgive me for telling you what episode from Season One I came to be drawn into; I cannot remember& I cannot lie....I watched the whole thing in a matter of 5 days accounting for sleep. Lark Rise to Candleford  is MAGNIFICENT!. As I watched I became more attuned to the writer of this script (and the author of the book altho' i've never read her) and the sublime messages that were imparted. After I got down to that last 4 episodes in Season Four I had no clue as to any ending or how things were going to be all tied up in a neat package& I wasn't looking for that either- the ending last episode reflected the values of what had been shown to you was built upon in the very beginning of Season One. After the last episode I shed tears. I really had a good old sob- & went to bed missing the Lark Rise to Candleford characters . Amazingly, as I was drawn into the drama I began to see Life's Lesson's on anger, fear, disappointment, matters of the heart ,etc. and presumed ""old ways"" and yet these still resonate today. I cannot recommend this series enough . You can let your kidsI( I would say anywhere from 6 yr of age watch this,too, as they would not be overexposed to subject matter that is questionable as in other media. I can also say it changed my life a bit by reminding me of what is known as ""universal truth""(s).

4213666,5,B003WEAW18,"Lark Rise to Candleford is a charming BBC period drama that tackles myriad themes, and is adapted from Flora Thompson's semi-autobiographical novel. In the first season, young Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) leaves her village of Lark Rise to work as an assistant to the postmistress in Candleford, Dorcas Lane ( a brilliant Julia Sawalha who first impressed me as Lydia Bennet in Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition)). Through the course of the first season, Laura discovers that she enjoys living in the more affluent town of Candleford, and experiences the pangs of adolescence, including romantic entanglements. Dorcas Lane, the kind-hearted and sensible postmistress also goes through some pangs of her own, largely to do with her friendship with squire, Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to the beautiful and composed Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant). In the first season, viewers got to see the themes of marital strife, conflicts between the upper and lower classes, romantic entanglements, and other issues played out.

By the second season, both Sir Timothy and Lady Adelaide have moved to London, but there is still plenty of drama in Dorcas' life with the arrival of James Dowland (Jason Merrells), a former inhabitant of Lark Rise, a local boy who has done well in life. A young clockmaker, Fisher Bloom (Matthew McNulty) comes to town, and Laura finds herself attracted to Fisher, though he seems oblivious to her charms, initially. Laura's parents, Robert and Emma Timmins (Brendan Coyle & Claudie Blakley) who have always been a very close and loving couple find themselves facing some marital strife in their marriage, and this second season takes an intimate look at their dynamics as a couple.

Season Three sees the introduction of a significant new character, Daniel Parrish (played by Ben Aldridge), a young journalist who arrives in Lark Rise with some life-altering news for the Timmins. The independent and strong-willed Dorcas Lane continues as Candleford's postmistress, and experiences some human drama of her own, taking on a role that she finds fulfills her immensely. Unlike previous seasons, Dorcas' story is no longer the only dominant thread this season, as other characters begin to get more screen time, such as postman Thomas Brown (Mark Heap) and his devoted wife Margaret Ellison (Sandy McDade); Minnie the maid (clumsy and awkward yet so innocent and plain speaking); the wise and at times clairvoyant Queenie Turrill (Linda Bassett) and her simpleton husband Twister; young Alf Arless (John Dagliesh), the Pratt sisters, Ruby and Pearl (Victoria Hamilton and Matilda Zeigler), and others.

In the final season i.e. Season Four, viewers only get to watch six episodes. There is also a significant absence in the form of actor Brendan Coyle (who played Robert Timmins). In the story, Robert's character is portrayed as having gone off to work elsewhere to send money home to his family (in actual fact, actor Brendan Coyle had landed a meaty role in the period drama Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey (Original UK Unedited Edition)). The first episode sees the introduction of a new character Gabriel Cochrane (Richard Harrington)who has lost his once flourishing foundry business to the bank and who is also recently widowed. Luckily for Gabriel, Dorcas offers him a job and a home and the people of Candleford welcome him into their fold. Gabriel however is intent on reclaiming his former position and vows to get back at the people who have cost him his livelihood. Emma Timmins finds herself at wits' end when the money sent by her husband Robert is lost by her son Edmund. In the second episode, Daniel Parrish who runs the local paper, organizes a poetry writing competition and Laura gets upset when there is insinuation of favoritism toward her (since Daniel and Laura are courting). In the third episode, Thomas the postman is ecstatic when he is put in charge of the church bazaar but clashes with the new reverend, forward thinking curate Reverend Marley. The reverend's relationship with Emma Timmins also gives rise to gossip. In the fourth episode, Alf and Minnie's love is tested when Alf wins the title King of the Fair and Queenie finds herself upset at Twister when he does something behind her back, involving a pig Queenie won. Episode Five revolves around a cricket match where Daniel is intent on victory against a neighboring town. Only problem is that Daniel's fledgling team lacks superior players, until he finds an unexpected star player. The final episode sees Gabriel working on an invention that may restore his wealth and standing, and it also focuses on the developing attraction between Gabriel and Dorcas. But are these two strong-willed and fiercely independent souls too independent-minded for their own good?

Frankly, I was rather underwhelmed by this final season. The actors did an amazing job in their roles, yet the stories just appeared to lack the extra 'something' that made the previous three seasons so special and incredibly addictive. None of the episodes in this season (well, except for the final episode perhaps) seemed to engage me as deeply as some of the episodes in the previous seasons - Dorcas' torment regarding her relationship with Sir Timothy Midwinter and the impact on Sir Timothy's wife (one of my favorite episodes was the one where Sir Tim's wife finds the abandoned girl and insists on raising her as their own given their childlessness, and then goes berserk when she finds Dorcas and Timothy have been sort of 'plotting' behind her back); the exploration of Emma and Robert Timmins' marriage and the episode where Emma tries to assert some independence and find her own 'voice'; the romance between Thomas and Ms. Ellison (their courtship is so comical yet sweet); the episode where both Candleford and Lark Rise come together to help with the harvest and the way the two communities deal with tragedy, and many more. I also did not care much for the character Gabriel Cochrane and felt the chemistry between Dorcas and Gabriel lacked credibility.

Despite the flaws in this season's episodes, I still gave it five stars if only because the acting was top-notch and the cinematography was spectacular as always. I will miss this series dearly and can only hope that the BBC will bring the cast back for at least a TV movie and tie up the loose ends - it would be a nice treat for the fans of LRTC.",1442880000,4,6421,5.025352112676057

There are a fair number of dark and unhappy EPDs out there, Lark Rise is not one of them... It's sweet, cute has its ups and downs and the characters develop nicely.

The series is set in the small Oxfordshire hamlet of Lark Rise and the wealthier neighboring market town of Candleford, towards the end of the 19th century. The series chronicles the daily lives of farm workers, craftsmen, and gentry, observing the characters in loving, boisterous, and competing communities of families, rivals, friends, and neighbors.
The story is seen through the eyes of a teenage girl, Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan), as she leaves Lark Rise to start a new life under the wing of her mother's cousin, the independent and effervescent Dorcas Lane (Julia Sawalha), who is Post Mistress at the local Post Office in Candleford.

The characters are engaging and memorable,  Minnie is a hoot.  And I named one of my cats after Miss Pratt - Pearl specifically as they have very similar prickly personalities!

One grows to love each and every character as they each show honest insights into the human condition, which transcends all time barriers. What an excellent script writer with so much insight into human nature. Wonderful handling of such tough human problems involving love, failure, and forgiveness.

4213724,5,B003WEAW18,"This show is a bit like ""Little House on the Prairie"" in terms of wholesome plots -- no blood, gore, profanity or gratuitous sex.  The actors are superb, and the plots are little vignettes of issues in life that all people face, from jealousy, to misplaced pride, to vanity, to love, honor, and respect, to name but a few. The time is the late 1800s as far as I can tell. It is one of the most relaxing, truly enjoyable series I have seen in quite a long time. My wife and I look forward to watching it as we can, but of course, we also record and watch such shows as The Good Wife, Justified, Blue Bloods, and Grimm. However, this production will surely transport you to a simpler time when there were no phones, no TV, no electrification of dwellings, no Internet or movies. It is so refreshing to watch people actually speaking with one another and the scenes last for minutes, not seconds as in most American TV.

Worth every penny.",1426377600,,936,4.373563218390805

I don't know why the APIV version was edited, or which version people get when they buy the episodes to stream, but I've really enjoyed watching the series over again with all the snippets I had apparently missed.  My one complaint: it isn't available on Blu-Ray, so there are a lot of discs, and the disc menus are clumsy to use.

It's innocent enough to recommend to my grandmother, and interesting and relevant enough that I can see watching it with my children and having appropriate conversations about life's events with them. It reminds me a bit of a more mature (current, maybe?) Avonlea from the late 1980s and early 1990s. All of the characters develop really well, each episode flows sequentially so you get buy-in to the story line, but they also stand alone enough that they don't leave you in cliff hanger mode- you get a little closure with each episode, so you can jump in anywhere. The best part? There are lots of season, so if you get hooked, there is lots to watch.",1423353600,,718,4.530769230769231

This was captivating, wonderfully written and cast, beautiful cinematography, set and costume design. I'd not heard of the author, but now have her books, and it's clear that the richness of the stories was born in her writing. The writers, producers and directors have honored her work, and in doing so, have brought a real treasure to the screen.

The story lines of each episode are thematic and pertinent to today's world as well as to the time period in which the series is set. The acting, set and costumes add much to the appeal of this series. While I can probably rise to my own conclusions for the ending of the series, I am surprised that the series did not continue through at least a fourth season. This series is refreshing to view in place of the violent viewing available and appropriate for all ages. I laughed and cried, and found the historical touches enlightening and informative.

4213766,5,B003WEAW18,"One of the best DVDs I own, and I have hundreds. I had the season one, before it was labeled season 1, for years on the shelf. I didn't realize the gem I had and after finally finished a lot of Dickens stories and decided to watch it. It didn't take long to realize ""why did I wait so long"" - and had to order the whole boxed set. given the modest extra $ from getting the other 3 seasons, I also knew I could give away season one and have a family member owe me one. This is indeed a great story line. I also watched both seasons of ""The Paradise"" about this time and couldn't miss the similar styles - to understand that look up who was involved.

The others talk about the story lines per se. I won't second guess the author's original works, but I thought this was great story. The special features do a great job providing background on this - what they did, how they pulled from the 3 books, the costumes and settings and in the final season actually going to the real village where the author lived - that is a real treat that many movies or miniseries never do. If you buy this, and you should, don't miss the special features, this one in particular.

The postmistress is the real centerpiece of the whole story, and that makes sense when you know that the real postmistress Flora once worked for was the biggest influence on her life, especially imparting wisdom. In this production, the viewers will enjoy that - it is often feels like being there. From Sir Timothy in season one to James Dowling in season 2 to the other characters who come in during seasons 2 and 3 (a half season - according to Wikipedia they couldn't continue because the driving force of the soul of this, the producer or director, had left and nobody could keep the style).

I really enjoyed how they did the final episode, bringing a great closure to 3 of the main characters' story lines. It is a great ending. If only all stories ended so well. Congrats to the crew and cast.",1420848000,3,1962,4.311653116531165

Among the many, many British costume dramas I've watched over the years - whether series, miniseries or films - this stands out as uniquely illuminating the human heart, each episode highlighting the growth of one or more characters in maturity, common sense, love, compassion, neighborliness, self-understanding. We've adored everything from Poldark to Downton Abbey, Inspector Morse to Cold Comfort Farm.

In another life I was probably in the Oxford area of England because I identify with it in all of the films centered around its past. The costumes! The beautiful countryside! The actors! Sometimes a little unbelievable, but always interesting. The small town feeling of it was just comforting to experience. I watched this in bits and pieces during its run on PBS, but never really got it. Buying the series and watching it from its beginning to its ending made it one heck of a way to spend rainy days indoors. Even though one character left to join another series that I also love, it ended positively in the land of ""happy ever after.""",1418256000,13,720,4.5038167938931295

This is not about rich folks,this is about plain folks on the upswing during the time of the industrial revolution when little towns and hamlets were being challenged by ""progress"" and all that means in terms of relationships and lifestyle, and values.  Acting is great!  Script writing and program plot are very well crafted.  I'm so surprised that more people are not on to this series.  Sadly it ended after 3 1/2 season.

I didn't want to have to wait for each disc to come in through a rental service so I looked online to buy. Once I started watching I couldn't stop...I really wish it had gone for longer than 4 Seasons!!!

If you frequent the BBC shows you will see lots of familiar faces: Brendan Coyle (Downton Abbey, North and South), Victoria Hamilton (Mansfield Park, Pride and Prejudice), Claudie Blakley (Pride and Prejudice, Cranford), Julia Sawalha (AbFab, Cranford), Linda Bassett (Calendar Girls, Sense and Sensibility), and Okivia Hallinan (The Paradise). You will even see the faces of Dawn French, Matthew McNulty, Burn Gorman, Ronald Pickup, and many more.

It is much cheaper to buy this collection than to purchase each of the four season separately, so I recommend if you love period drama with mystery, comedy, and romance that you check this show out! You will not be disappointed!",1406073600,3,1061,4.7923497267759565

It takes a few episodes to orient one's self to the inhabitants of Lark Rise (the farming hamlet) and its more sophisticated neighbor, Candleford.  Once you learn who's who, it's a complete and utter delight.  The narrator, Laura Timmons, is a young woman who moves from Lark Rise to work in Candleford's post office with its owner, Miss Dorcas Lane.  This move opens up a new world for Laura.  It's difficult to choose a favorite character for each one is unique and memorable.  I anticipate that the stories will not be tied up neatly in the end since this series was not renewed after the third season despite high ratings and audience desire.  That's my only complaint.

4213856,5,B003WEAW18,"It is hard to find a series with such an array of characters, so many varied and interesting stores, and tremendous sets. Downton Abbey is extremely good, but Lark Rise wins by a nose in terms of story lines, characters and sheer lovability (Is there even such a word?).

The lives of the families from the up and coming, and wealthier town of Candleford are closely intermingled with those of the poor hamlet of Lark Rise, as each face changing times. Almost every pertinent subject is gently dealt with .. religion, politics, morality, the role of women, love, parental responsibility, business, finances, good (and bad) neighbours and even corsets.

Where else are you going to find a sometimes annoying Twister Turrill, a wise and wonderful Queenie, a ridiculously endearing Minnie, a Pearl or Ruby Pratt, or the lady with the backbone of steel... Emma Timmins. To say nothing of Mark Brown... the postman who you want to hung and take a stick to at the same time.  Oh yes, and not forgetting that other wonderful actress Sandy McDade, who plays Margaret, the postman's long suffering wife. Brendan Coyle is as good as he always is as the wise, but slightly pig headed Robert Timmins. The only person I disliked intensely was Dawn French who played Caroline Arless. But then I couldn't stand her in Vicar of Dibley either. Luckily she was only in the initial episodes, or she might have cast a shadow over the entire series.

After a few episodes, we almost feel like we have known the people of Lark Rise and Candleford for a long time.

My husband and I are now close to the last episodes, and are going to be very sorry to see it come to an end. I am sure that, in a year or two, we shall enjoy it once more.",1393977600,5,1715,4.5372168284789645

It's not UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS and it's not DOWNTON ABBEY, but it is the ""country folk,"" well done and enjoyable.

4213866,5,B003WEAW18,"This is truly the most beautiful series I have ever seen. As each series progressed, the characters developed and became more and more loveable, as their foibles were as endearing as their kindnesses. Each separate story was wonderful because there was inevitably a problem but one which the viewer knew would be solved in a perfect way, and the settings are beyond beautiful! I do not think such 'feel good' set of stories has ever been made, and yet there was nothing slushy or over-romantic about them.

4213871,3,B003WEAW18,"Just finished watching ""Lark Rise to Candleford"" on Prime instant video.  My take on the series was that it started well, and was at it's best when dealing with the changes facing a rural population at the edge of industrialization, and the resulting social issues that were arising from the mixing of town and country due to changing from an agrarian to industrial economy. Queenie realizing there was no market for her skills, but showing Ruby how to make lace, for instance, was an incredibly powerful piece.  The effects of measles on the hamlet, and the helplessness of choosing between one's children and one's livelihood speaks to the pain so many families today have when faced with employers that don't offer time off for family health issues. By season four, however, the show had dissolved into little more than a soap opera about the life of the spinster postmistress, with comic relief from her silly sidekick, Minnie. Laura had become a whining caricature, and the one of the strongest characters, Robert, had presumably hired off to Downton Abbey. There was a lot of potential in Lark Rise, that might have helped explain that important pivot point of the later half of the 19th century, seen through the eyes of a small community, but it was lost in brainless fluff.",1390262400,7,1282,4.8493150684931505
4213872,5,B003WEAW18,"I really enjoy these stories so much, just like Downtown Abbey the Authors give considerable depth to the charters. The acting is superb!

The Mason,his wife,the Beekeeper, her husband and the village's misguided Mom and her son keep everything running in the village. There is  a great many cast of characters. The mail carrier,the housekeeper for the Postmistress and many merchants and such that live in town. Many more people in the village. Also, the Lord and Lady of the manor.

The Timmins living in a small cottage with 5 children . Lark Rise seems to be the poor villiage, while Candleford is the larger city.  So, The line is drawn between the city folkes, and the country type folk who still believe in the ancient traditions. The Lark Rise people live in small cottages and barely have enough to eat, while Dorcas always has a table full of food. Dorcas is enchanting and I adore her line ""This is my only weakness""..she has lots of those only weaknesses.

In general, the shows are appropriate for the whole family, although too slow-paced for anyone younger than pre-teen. The episodes are generally positive, although they don't always result in happy endings for the characters.

4213914,5,B003WEAW18,"We're almost all the way through the series and I thought I would write this before I forgot. Truly a magnificent series. I have NEVER seen ANY series where each actor was so perfect for their character. British series excel at this but Lark Rise is simply astounding. As the episodes progress, you get to know each character intimately and see them, warts and all. While there are continuing threads throughout the series, each episode can stand alone pretty well but one would be well advised to start from the beginning to get the feel for each character's development. I particularly like the gentle moral(s) each episode brings out; a terrific guideline for a young child (although I would admit it can get a little simplistic at times) but some of the story lines can bring a tear to your eye. I did not like it when some of the main characters who were strong in some episodes all of a sudden were gone in future episodes and never returned without any explanations about why. It was not a drastic occurrence and did not cause any jarring to any particular story line; you all of a sudden noticed that a peripheral character was no longer present. But it does not take anything away from this magnificent and tender series.
And I do agree with other reviewers about the series just stopping; not that I think anything should be 'wrapped up' (life just does go on), rather that I just wanted to see what happened next to these two villages. I think it could have been a six or eight season, easily. Oh, yes, this is the only one where I let the opening music play all the way through before I select the next episode; it is just such a fitting and marvelous tune.
DON'T MISS THIS ONE!!! (Don't pay any attention to those '1 stars' - phooey! - notice there are NO 2, 3, 4 stars!! Well, there weren't any when I wrote this.)",1374624000,11,1828,4.459701492537313

4213921,1,B003WEAW18,"Contains too many opinions and views for my taste.  Throughout the series, it just seems like the writer(s) are pushing their strong opinions down everyone's throat.  What's more their views are unsound and unBiblical.

It is very apparent that their intention is to make a mockery of Christianity.  Miss Lane is somewhat of a narcissist who doesn't believe in God but does believe in her own power and wisdom as an almighty know it all.

Overall, the show is very annoying.  I'm a Christian and I make it a habit not to accept advice from any source that does not hold God's Word as its standard.  Wisdom apart from God is foolishness as was Miss Lane's babblings and the words of the other ""seemingly"" wise characters.

Mrs. Timmons constantly fought against her husband's authority throughout the series.  There were so many contradictions in family values and child rearing. For instance, one minute Mrs. Timmons is interfering in her husband's discipline of the oldest son.  Then later on, several episodes later, Mr. Timmons interferes when she is disciplining the children.  She goes all hysterical stating that he is not too question her discipline methods in front of the children.  Huh???  Okay. I could go on with many other instances like this but I'd rather soon forget the whole thing.  Fact is, I only continued watching it because my husband really liked the show.  He's able to just watch things at face value for pure entertainment so it didn't bother him.

Basically, I find it a bit amusing that unbelievers think themselves so wise in attacking Christianity but in so doing, they prove themselves to be no more than blundering fools.",1372809600,26,1654,4.874551971326165

So I bought the complete set .  It is just the loveliest story of the hamlet of Lark Rise and the town of Candleford and the interactions of the people, both those who like things as they are and those open to progress.  The quaintness of the setting and the story are heart warming. One can become attached to the characters and having the DVD's allowed us to follow the tale chronologically.  It's full of human foible and decency and good for family viewing..  The filming was beautiful as well.  Love the period they live in.",1364947200,,694,4.4523809523809526
4213949,5,B003WEAW18,"I happened upon this show on PBS quite by accident. Unfortunately, the scheduling was haphazard, then it went off the air. I am so happy I bought it. The writing, acting, & set design is exquisite. You really become involved in the lives of the people of Lark Rise & Candleford. Julia Swahala is ""absolutely fabulous"", pun intended. I love this show. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants something that is intelligent, heart warming, & uplifting. Too much garbage on TV, that's why I watch PBS. Only praise for this show. The only dislike is that it ended in the middle of the 4th season. Perhaps a special to wrap it up? Thank you BBC. for this wonderful production.

Just wanted to update my review, [June 6,2013]. I am watching Season 3 now & there hasn't been one episode of this show so far where I haven't laughed and cried. I feel like I ""know"" these people, their hamlet, their town, that's how realistic this show is. Makes me want to be part of it all. Oh, to have Queenie as my mother & Dorcas as my confidante & friend. Robert wouldn't be so bad as a husband either, lol. Love, love, love, this show. I will be heartbroken when I have finished the last disc. Now, if only Amazon had had the current price available when I bought the collection,lol, but it's worth every penny I spent.
I just can't say enough about this collection. What television programming should be.",1364688000,8,1388,4.486166007905139

4213953,5,B003WEAW18,"I purchased this delightful 'complete series' at Christmas time and knew I'd probably enjoy it based on all the wonderful reviews. I did not expect it to quickly become my favorite series of all time. I was hopelessly addicted from the first episode, and have since shared it with my Mother and my Aunt who both fell in love with it as well. (My Aunt had felt that it could not compare to Downton Abbey, but within a few episodes she was forced to admit she liked it way better) Watching Lark Rise to Candleford offers you the chance to escape in to a wholesome, innocent world full of gorgeous scenery and wonderfully entertaining characters. Every heart warming episode is a beautiful story filled with brilliant acting, stunning scenery and a good dose of humor. (I found myself laughing out loud at some of these characters and their hilarious personalities) I also cried at times, and especially at the end of the last episode. Not because it was a sad ending, but because I hated to leave these characters and their world! If like me you sometimes long for a simpler, more wholesome time, this is your ticket to it. Adding more to its value, it is the kind of show you can watch again and again. I look forward to re-watching the whole series in the near future and I am so glad it is a part of my movie library.",1364083200,,1318,4.450413223140496

4213959,5,B003WEAW18,"This is definitely one of my all-time favorite BBC TV Series! I absolutely adore the well-written episodes, the characters, and the beautiful time-period costuming and scenery. It is a wonderful escape as it takes you back to a time when life was slower-paced and well-appreciated. There are not many TV shows out there anymore that teach the value of family, friends, and love of the simple things in everyday life like this one does. It reminds me of ""Little House on the Prairie,"" only smarter and more-adult-driven. I even bought Flora Thompsons original book the series is based on! The characters become like your best friend and remind you of someone you might already know. I also love the many ""Behind the Scene"" extras included with the set. It really shows how everyone was so passionately involved with this series. I could watch this show forever; I only wish it would have continued on. If you like ""Call the Midwife"" you'll enjoy this one as well.

Almost totally character-driven, it's a thrill to watch and keeps you deeply engrossed in the characters.  Julia Sawalha is magnificent as Dorcas Lane, a character so opposite of the hideous Lydia she played in ""Pride and Prejudice"" that you can hardly believe it's her.  Brendan Coyle (Downton Abbey) is excellent as Robert Timmins, along with other standouts Linda Bassett(Queenie), Karl Johnson(Twister), Sandy McDade(Margaret), Ruby Bentall(Minnie), and Victoria Hamilton & Matilda Ziegler as the Pratt sisters.

I think this show is right up there with Downton Abbey as far as the quality of tv. I love all those shows from across the pond and I think I have maybe 1/16th of Irish and 1/16 of English. I hope you all will go into your attics and dig out as many outstanding shows you have buried there. I think the best part is that there isn't any sex and violence like in American shows.

It is gentle & unhurried, yet I'm never bored because the script is so dense & masterfully crafted, and the camera shots & scenery are tightly relevant, poetically pictorially deepening the theme & emotions of each scene. Every word is carefully chosen, all the scenery details meaningful. The series explores many socio historical themes, as well as universal truths of the human soul. It is full of a deep common sense type of wisdom, and the timeless beauties of life. If you long for simplicity, heart & wholesomeness, you may feel purified & uplifted watching this series. The characters are lively, and archetypal. The acting is pure perfection, the costumes exquisite, the lighting & camerawork are pure poetry, the sound quality is great. This is not highly personal drama, where human flaws & lower emotions are indulged, counterpointed and given center stage. I would say this drama is more reflective, almost contemplative in style.",1359331200,5,1009,5.121212121212121

Such great characters & stories, all wonderfully cast & acted! It never failed to delight!

The end was a bit abrupt (inconclusive & sudden), as it didn't complete season 4, so I'd hoped to read the books it was based on to get ""closure"".

4213987,5,B003WEAW18,"I loved this simple, sweet, romanticized series about life in two small English villages in the late 19th century - one rather prosperous, the other really workaday. The characters are appealing. No violence. Some romance. Strong female characters and some interesting male characters. Lots of good comic characters (gossipy sisters, pompous mail carrier, lazy husband) seen through the eyes of a young woman trying to decide between a career and a husband - a modern dilemma in a quaint setting. This is suitable for everyone, but will appeal most to women who love period romance novels.

I have no idea how historically accurate it might be, but it's great fun. Like all terrific shows, each episode has both humor and drama. The two communities are supposed to be 8 miles apart, and I must say everyone must be in terrific physical shape as often as the characters make the trip between the two.

She who pretends to know everything and is sooooo...friendly and neighborly with everyone.  She has had good marriage prospects time and time again, and even loved them...one at a time of course...but when she did finally marry, it was to some...loser!

As far as the other characters in the series, especially those from Lark Rise, is that how the English people really lived?  Were they really that stupid?  The BBC has time and time again projected the English people of the past as jokes.  Why would they do that?  The writers of this saga did not do their history.  If they had, they would have found out that so many things they are portraying about these people and their lifestyles just simply did not exist.

To know the history of that time is to know they could not in all honesty praise it to high heaven!  I have done my homework and I know that the writer(s) of this series took an ungodly amount of artistic license.  Do not believe half of what you see and hear in this saga.  Another thing.  I paid $42.99 for the complete series last month, and just days after I noticed the price was $142.99.  The price increased by 66% in a matter of days!  I ask you, is that right?

There are some good subject matters in this film series, but the bad seriously outweighs the good.  I have lived long enough to know that what I say here is the truth.

In the 4th season, there was the annual fair held...in downtown Candleford of all places.  Those annual fairs did exist, but there was a field set aside for that purpose.  If a woman like Caroline Arless has pulled half the stunts as this one is portrayed to have pulled, she would have been run out of town on a rail. There is no way the people would have condoned her actions.  And the interfering in other peoples lives to such an extent as this?  Come on!  And for people to have had children out of wedlock and not be outcasts;  that was not the way it was.  Their morals were very strict, I know, I grew up with these kind of morals everywhere around me.  I am no spring chicken and I know of what I speak.  There are so many things wrong with this series I could go on for 300 pages, but I won't.

I ordered it immediately. All I can say is that (after watching only a few episodes of season one), I'm very, very satisfied with the BBC Boxed Set. Even if you're reading this and the price has gone up again, if it's at all possible for you to purchase this wonderful, wonderful show, DO IT.

When it was all over, I rented it and watched through it all again and found myself wanting more, so I bought it. It is more like The Waltons than Little House (to me anyway) and has a great honest feel to it. It is nice to not have to hear cussing, see boobies or have violence all over the screen.

The characters are engaging though a bit over the top and fun to follow as this saga winds along what seems to be an endless path.  Apart from the emotional bait that abounds, the series provides a unique insight into life in England as it approached the end of the agrarian age and moved forward into industry and more modern times and attitudes.

The tales are quite good and entertaining, looking at the more polished Candleford denizens and their more rural and friends, neighbors, and, yes, relatives living in Larkrise.  It's about a day's walk between the two villages, but a world apart in culture, clothing, and circumstances.

We've watched the entire production, and enjoyed it.  Some of the episodes drag on a bit, but when one is looking at all of these in toto, there are bound to be some episodes that are better than others.

4214047,5,B003WEAW18,"Lark Rise to Candleford: The Complete Season One is a charming series that tackles myriad themes, and is adapted from Flora Thompson's semi-autobiographical novel. In the first season, young Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) leaves her village of Lark Rise to work as an assistant to the postmistress in Candleford, Dorcas Lane (Julia Sawalha who was also brilliant in her role as Lydia Bennet in Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)). Through the course of the first season, Laura discovers that she enjoys living in the more affluent town of Candleford, and experiences the pangs of adolescence, including romantic entanglements. Dorcas Lane, the kind-hearted and sensible postmistress also goes through some pangs of her own, largely to do with her friendship with squire Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to the beautiful and uptight Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant). In the first season, viewers got to see the themes of marital strife, conflicts between the upper and lower classes, romantic entanglements, and other issues played out.

By the second season, both Sir Timothy and Lady Adelaide have moved to London, but there is still plenty of drama in Dorcas' life with the arrival of James Dowland (Jason Merrells), a former inhabitant of Lark Rise, a local boy who has done well in life. Being a self-made and wealthy man, James settles in Candleford, though he reacquaints himself with the residents of Lark Rise, especially Queenie Turrill (Linda Bassett) who used to take care of him as a young boy. James opens a fashionable hotel in Candleford, and tries to 'improve' the lives of the Lark Rise residents with mixed results. There is also strong chemistry between James and Dorcas, though their relationship flounders between attraction and rivalry/conflict. Laura seems more mature and wiser, having learned a couple of enlightening things about the pitfalls of romance, and is taking on more responsibilities at the post office. But then, a young clockmaker, Fisher Bloom (Matthew McNulty) comes to town, and Laura finds herself attracted to Fisher, though he seems oblivious to her charms. Laura's parents, Robert and Emma Timmins (Brendan Coyle & Claudie Blakley) who have always been a very close and loving couple find themselves facing some marital strife in their marriage, and this second season takes an intimate look at their dynamics as a couple.

There is also plenty of drama amongst the other inhabitants of Lark Rise & Candleford - the sisters Pearl and Ruby Pratt (Matilda Ziegler, Victoria Hamilton) who have a dressmaking/drapery store continue to pry into others' affairs whilst dealing with their own emotional dramas. Postman Thomas Brown's (Mark Heap)romantic (mis)adventures continue, and many more.

Season Three sees the introduction of a significant new character, Daniel Parrish (played by Ben Aldridge), a young journalist who arrives in Lark Rise with some life-altering news for the Timmins. Emma (Claudie Blakley) might inherit a fortune, and both Emma and her husband Robert (Brendan Coyle) ponder the possibilities and opportunities this signifies for them as a family. Parrish is also drawn to Laura Timmins (Olivia Hallinan) who has matured into a true beauty.

The independent and strong-willed Dorcas Lane (played by the talented and lovely Julia Sawalha) continues as Candleford's postmistress, and experiences some human drama of her own, taking on a role that she finds fulfills her immensely. Unlike previous seasons, Dorcas' story is no longer the only dominant thread this season, as other characters begin to get more screen time (yes, I was not too pleased with this, but I felt some of these stories were still well done). One story arc which I particularly enjoyed watching was the marital adventures of postman Thomas Brown (Mark Heap) and his devoted wife Margaret Ellison (Sandy McDade). Their antics just make me laugh out loud, and yet there is also a poignancy to their marriage which is explored later in the season. This balance makes them an interesting couple to watch on-screen and the actors outdo themselves in lending credibility and depth to their characters.

Minnie, the bumbling yet lovable maid from Season 2 is given a meatier role this season, and I loved how Dorcas takes Minnie under her wing, grooming her not for a life of servitude but for something far more worthy and fulfilling, with mixed results - a blend of hilarity and poignancy that had me laughing one moment and tearing up the next.

Strong and resilient Emma Timmins also gets a chance to explore other sides to her role - she is not just a loving mother and loyal wife this season, but yearns to be something more which I felt rounded-out her character very nicely this season. One of the story arcs I've loved throughout seasons 1-3 is the strong bond of love between Robert and Emma Timmins, one which is further explored this season.

The Pratt sisters, Ruby and Pearl (Victoria Hamilton and Matilda Zeigler) continue their roles as town busybodies and this season sees a major upheaval which threatens the sisters formerly close knit bond with each other. Young Alf Arless (John Dagliesh, also one of my favorite characters after Dorcas and Robert) begins to mature into his role as the head of his family, assuming real responsibilities, but also faces some serious and heartbreaking challenges.

This season also sees the inhabitants of Lark Rise and Candleford coming together in a time of crisis, helping each other out, and setting aside their differences which I felt was timely and touching. The stories make you feel like you're there, experiencing these people's joys and pains, their triumphs and failures, and the slowly developing sense of community between both hamlets.

In the final season i.e. Season Four, viewers only get to watch six episodes. There is also a significant absence in the form of actor Brendan Coyle (who played Robert Timmins). In the story, Robert's character is portrayed as having gone off to work elsewhere to send money home to his family (in actual fact, actor Brendan Coyle had landed a meaty role in the period drama Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey. The first episode sees the introduction of a new character Gabriel Cochrane (Richard Harrington)who has lost his once flourishing foundry business to the bank and who is also recently widowed. Luckily for Gabriel, Dorcas offers him a job and a home and the people of Candleford welcome him into their fold. Gabriel however is intent on reclaiming his former position and vows to get back at the people who have cost him his livelihood. Emma Timmins finds herself at wits' end when the money sent by her husband Robert is lost by her son Edmund. In the second episode, Daniel Parrish who runs the local paper, organizes a poetry writing competition and Laura gets upset when there is insinuation of favoritism toward her (since Daniel and Laura are courting). In the third episode, Thomas the postman is ecstatic when he is put in charge of the church bazaar but clashes with the new reverend, forward thinking curate Reverend Marley. The reverend's relationship with Emma Timmins also gives rise to gossip. In the fourth episode, Alf and Minnie's love is tested when Alf wins the title King of the Fair and Queenie finds herself upset at Twister when he does something behind her back, involving a pig Queenie won. Episode Five revolves around a cricket match where Daniel is intent on victory against a neighboring town. Only problem is that Daniel's fledgling team lacks superior players, until he finds an unexpected star player. The final episode sees Gabriel working on an invention that may restore his wealth and standing, and it also focuses on the developing attraction between Gabriel and Dorcas. But are these two strong-willed and fiercely independent souls too independent-minded for their own good?

Frankly, I was rather underwhelmed by this final season. The actors did an amazing job in their roles, yet the stories just appeared to lack the extra 'something' that made the previous three seasons so special and incredibly addictive. None of the episodes in this season (well, except for the final episode perhaps) seemed to engage me as deeply as some of the episodes in the previous seasons - the exploration of Emma and Robert Timmins' marriage and the episode where Emma tries to assert some independence and find her own 'voice'; the romance between Thomas and Ms. Ellison (their courtship is so comical yet sweet); the episode where both Candleford and Lark Rise come together to help with the harvest and the way the two communities deal with tragedy, and many more. I also did not care much for the character Gabriel Cochrane and felt the chemistry between Dorcas and Gabriel lacked credibility.

Despite the flaws in this season's episodes, I still gave it five stars if only because the acting was top-notch and the cinematography was spectacular as always. I will miss this series dearly and can only hope that the BBC will bring the cast back for at least a TV movie and tie up the loose ends - it would be a nice treat for the fans of LRTC. This boxed set is the perfect complement to any LRTC fan's DVD library.",1333411200,3,9220,5.011749347258486
4214048,5,B003WEAW18,"We have so enjoyed this rural Victorian drama about the changing life in Oxfordshire and the surrounding counties at the end of the 19th century. We decided partway through watching the series on borrowed discs that we wanted to own it and probably would watch more than once. Our friends are enjoying it, too. We decided to read the book which we found differed from the series mainly in the narrative threads added to the video version. (The book is more description and essay.) Reasons why we like it so much: superb acting ensemble, depictions of bygone rural life such as threshing, village interactions in everyday life and special celebrations, gardens, the contrast between the hamlet and the town, the aspirations and accomplishments of women (running of the post office, getting out of corsets, becoming a writer), and the fading traces of a feudal labor economy. The characters of Laura, cousin Dorcas, Laura's parents, Alfie, Thomas and Margaret, the sisters Pratt, Queenie and Twister, and the others offered richly textured moments of humor and pathos in a beautifully crafted setting. Has the narrative force of a soap, but with humor and a humane touch.",1333152000,4,1169,5.030927835051546

4214050,5,B003WEAW18,"I enjoyed every single episode! This deserves more than the full 5 stars! I now have my mom addicted to the series, and she is trying hard not to watch them all too fast, because she doesn't want it to end!
Makes me want to go England to see the places! The series is based on the author's true life, and fictionalized.  She wrote three books and this series is based on those according to the introduction in the front of the book, that is available too, ""Larkrise to Candleford""....I just started reading that. My mom is so taken with this series that she felt we both need to own the complete dvd series and book - Yeah :) I, of course, did not turn down the offer of the gift, and because of Prime, they arrived the next morning!
The characters are well developed and loveable. You will get a chuckle out of the characters and you might even get misty eyed in a place or two. All in all this series is a delight to watch.  They don't make 'em like this anymore - at least not in America, sadly.
I feel the need to address the one star given:
One reviewer wrote that it was like a good book that you don't want to end.  I couldn't agree more with that description.  That feeling could be why the one person gave this only one star.  The minute the very last episode ends you find yourself thinking ""wait, what happens to so and so""....but it didn't take me long to reflect on each character and realize that they really did 'wrap things up' - and didn't leave us hanging ...you have to go back over each character & think ""ok, this one went on and did this, that one went on and did that.."" and so on. I would have liked to see that actually played out in more episodes. So imo that one star is really only for ending the series too soon. When one feels that way it is usually because they like the series so much that they don't want it to end. I just don't feel that one star was justified, just my opinion.
Interestingly I think there are many places in the series where things still apply in this modern world.",1332547200,2,2017,4.188144329896907

4214059,5,B003WEAW18,"This is series based on three novels published in the 1940s about a young woman and the families in two particular towns. The stories are set in the late 1800s, just before the turn of the century. The novels are semi-autobiographical, so they have an honest appeal to them.

The events that occur are not the earth shattering and ground breaking instances that most major series are filled with. Instead the stories revolve around everyday life in these two hamlets. Lark Rise is conservative, smaller, and more remote. Candleford is a town on the rise with influences from near and far. We see these influences with such subtle hints as the unveiling of the latest Parisian fashions for example. Several of the stories deal with family issues, debts, and work. Troubles that still ring true even today.

There are some terrific actors and actresses that one might recognize from Cranford, Downton Abbey, and other top notch British drama series. The roles are played well with an emphasis on subtlety, instead of the more dramatic performances in series such as Downton. The acting and the sets remind me a lot more of Cranford, despite the 40 or 50 year gap in their time periods.

Though the series starts with young Laura as the apparent main character, she acts more as a foil to the other various characters. It is a slow paced series, and many of the supporting characters have episodes focused on them. It's all very well done and there is no sense to trying to fit too much in. Often the scenes and episodes can be rather sparse and quiet.

The show went on for four seasons (series as they are known in the UK) and was sadly not renewed for a fifth, despite impressive ratings. Whether you watch on instant streaming or on DVD, the show is very good and is a nice change of pace from some of the more dramatic pieces out there. Which is not to say there isn't drama! But it's definitely a more toned down series. If you get through episode three and aren't hooked, then you probably won't want to continue watching. But if you are like me, by episode three you start to see the real genius here and want to watch more.",1327449600,,2129,4.56544502617801

When PBS took a break from showing it to do their yearly telethon, it was like going into withdrawal. I love everything about this series. At first glance it reminded me of a minseries version of Cranford (a movie I absolutely loved). Every time I watch an episode I almost wished I could live in Candleford (if I don't think about things like disease, corsets, spinsterhood, and the sanitary conditions). Every story, every character, every emotion is vividly and well portrayed. Even some of the characters who are small-minded and annoying are still likable. I grieve for Dorcas and her lost loves and yet her goodness and strength are ever present.

Unfortunately, if I were to write down everything I loved about this series, I'd end up going on forever. Needless to say if you are a fan of period pieces and/or British dramedies you will love this series.

Interesting and educational to see the interaction between the classes, the clothing of the era and the ongoing relationships develop.  We would recommend this to anyone even if you don't think you're into 'period pieces'.  My brother-in-law got hooked too.",1316390400,,366,4.777777777777778
4214083,5,B003WEAW18,"This is a great series. I liked it so much that it prompted me to go visit the Cotswolds (which is what the area in the movie looks like, but not where the action actually takes place). I thought the characters were complex, not one dimensional. I thought the themes were diverse, but in keeping with the times and the character of the place. I loved that they never jumped the shark and got outlandish. The emotional conflicts were real and human. Even when people weren't so likable (like the Pratts), they were understandable. It's all rated G, so there was no foul language, overt sex, or nudity. It's just good, pure entertainment. I bought the book to see how closely the series parallels what was written. I want more! :)",1316044800,,728,4.564885496183206

4214085,1,B003WEAW18,"Our family was so impressed with the first season of this series!  The character development was exceptionally done, and the stories were sensitively told.

I'm editing my review in order to group my criticisms by type.  My first concern has to do with the portrayal of Christians, my second is about the loss of character consistency, and my third concern is about the suitability of some episodes for children.

FIRST: the portrayal of Christians is problematic.  They are portrayed as awkward, socially inept (Thomas) or overbearing, cruel and rigid (pastor), or timid and uptight (pastor's daughter).  By contrast, the strong characters -- the ones who deal well with the situation at hand, who have solutions and who behave naturally -- are not religious.  The mysterious, fortune-telling, sceance-leading Queenie, is shown in a positive light.  She can tell just by quickly examining a woman's eyes that the woman is pregnant.  The negative portrayal of Christians continues more blatantly in the second season.  One example occurs when the caring and selfless almost-doctor George Ellison reveals how his bully father, the local pastor, suddenly withdrew all financial support because his son George didn't believe in God.

SECOND: the episodes in season 2 revolve around a select topic or two in a way which is more transparent than season one, and the characters are used as mouthpieces for the writers' views on these topics.  What happens then, is that characters are made to say and do things which are not in keeping with the personalities that were presented in the first season.  Emma Timmons, for example, who was an extremely admirable and supportive central character, goes on a tirade against her husband in the male-female relations episode (but we're supposed to cheer for her husband-bashing speech).  She'll feel so free and liberated on the afternoon that (thank God!) all her children are gone for the day, and she'll do undignified cartwheels in the time-youth episode (but we're supposed to see this as a symbol of freedom and spontaneity).  Laura Timmons will quite willingly tell a lie in the second season, and Robert Timmons becomes a caricature of himself in temper-losing.

THIRD: many of the shows are not suitable for younger children.  Season 2 begins with a Christmas special, which was definitely unsuitable for young families, unlike all of season one.  It revolved around a young female ghost, who disturbed all the residents.  The music was eerie, and the mood was extremely unpleasant.  Our family watched almost in disbelief, because we had come to trust the show as delivering enjoyable entertainment.  But the episode did not lighten up in the least -- it culminated with a midnight seance (communicating with the dead) led by Queenie. The show ended, and my children were too frightened to go upstairs to their beds without me being with them.  (Thanks a lot!)  I was wondering whether I could trust the show.  Should I continue to watch other episodes?  The last straw for us came in season 2 when Laura Timmons received three hate notes.  The first note said ""Silly Bich,"" and so my two older children were asking what a 'bitch' was.  The third package that she receives cuts her hand while she is holding it, and the camera zooms in on her hand which is now dripping with blood.  (Nice!)

Depending on the age of your children, other episodes might be unsuitable for other reasons.  One episode focuses on Minnie, the unmarried, unsophisticated young maid.  Minnie thinks she's pregnant, and Alf asks her whose baby it is. In fact, a lot of people have questions for her, and the show has now introduced a topic that might not be suitable for every family just yet.

We're really disappointed.",1315094400,96,3742,4.985483870967742
4214086,5,B003WEAW18,"Lark Rise to Candleford is a BBC series based on a book by Flora Thompson.  The series were highly recommended to me by my husband who bought a complete set from Amazon, for me to watch it at my own pace and leisure and I must say it is an excellent show and I enjoyed every minute of it.  It had a peculiar effect of calming my nerves and leaving a pleasant feeling in me because the characters in the story were generous, understanding, compassionate, and firm when necessary. To my surprise, the screenplay did not have any violence or unnecessary sexual scenes.  A movie without sex and violence is rather rare these days.  Every evening I was eager to watch the next installment.  Most of the characters were serious about their obligations, performed their duties diligently and above all they respected each other.  There was a bond in the community and that is what impressed me the most. The writer of the series has taken a lot of effort to depict the late 19th century life style as realistically as possible.  Darcus Lane, who runs a post office, stands out as a role model and she is adorable.  Her very smile makes one feel a thrill of joy.
The story takes place at the end of 19th century when industrialization was on the verge of beginning a new era. Laura, who is the daughter of Emma and Roberts, narrates the story by writing daily events in her diary.  We are talking about the period 1880 to 1890 in England.  The agriculture is the main occupation of the inhabitants, income is limited, and many people live in poverty and others hand to mouth, Robert's family enjoys relatively a better standard of living because Robert is literate and holds the position of a very skillful mason.  He is the leader in the community and people respect him.  He feels the land- lords are exploiting the farmers by paying them low wages and believes in a kind of a socialistic system that would create a fair wage structure for all.
Laura is beautiful, has many likable qualities, loves her parents, and shows a lot of compassion for others. Her mother is very proud of her because Laura loves to read and write. Laura has a younger brother who is very serious for his age and wants to join the army or work on the farm.  Emma does not consider working on the farm an honorable profession and feels one cannot have a better living standard just by being a farmer.  Emma is tired of the hardships of life not having enough money to spend.
Darcus Lane is Emma's cousin, who has inherited a forge and other business from her relatively wealthy father, now deceased.  Darcus is poised, well- educated, practical in business matters and runs a post office in her home in Candleford.  During the period in which the story takes place, the government did not run post offices directly but rather subcontracted the postal functions to the private individuals.  The important rule to run a post office was the person must be unmarried and take an oath before a magistrate that there will be no delay in delivering letters or telegrams.
Darcus has employed as a postman, a tall and handsome fellow who promptly delivers the letters and fervently talks about his allegiance to queen Victoria.  His loyalty and dedication to his profession is admirable but at times looks very funny.
The village population was gradually growing and Darcus needed one more person to deliver the mail.  People working in the farm could not come to the post office to collect the mail.  For their sake, Darcus kept post office open in the late hours.  She wrote a letter to Emma and Robert asking that if they approve, she would like to have Laura work in the post office as her assistant.  Laura accepts the job and begins working happily in the post office. She lives in Darcus' home, has a room to herself and a comfortable bed.  Another member in the Darcus' household is Zilla, an elderly woman rather obese and slow moving, employed to clean and cook. One day while relaxing, she suddenly dies. Later, Darcus hires a young girl to whom she entrusts the job of cooking and other household chores.  The girl is ignorant and has no idea of how to cook. She is afraid if she does not learn her new job she will have to go back to her father from whom she has run away, because of his violent temper and his beating her. Darcus sympathizes and starts her with simple menial tasks.  The girl is thankful to Darcus, does her job as best as she can and is loyal to her.  Laura is also friendly with the girl and helps her to learn certain chores. The girl appears in some very funny scenes, shows up at odd moments, and says something stupid when Darcus is having a serious conversation with her clients.  Darcus would order her in her stern voice to go and clean the attic, meaning thereby, do not interrupt.  At every difficult, awkward moment, Darcus exhibits her calmness and composure.
Another important character in the story is Timothy, the local landlord and a magistrate who in the past dated Darcus but the latter did not reciprocate because she felt there was an economic disparity between the two and, therefore, their relationship would not succeed if they got married.  Later Timothy marries a beautiful woman but he still keeps visiting Darcus in the post office and other places regularly despite the fact she discourages such visits.
Occasionally business people come to Candleford to start a new business.  On one occasion, a businessman, who it turns out was brought up in the village of Lark Rise, comes to Candleford, and opens a hotel in the town. It later transpires that he has left a son in some other place.  Darcus goes there and brings him back to his father. The child is very attached to Darcus. He prefers to live with her than with his father.  While barely a young lad, his father decides to leave him with Darcus and then moves to another town.  Darcus later legally adopts and raises the child.
Finally, Darcus meets a man whom she has allowed to work in her forge. She falls in love with him and they get married.
Laura meets a journalist and she marries him.
The show has several other interesting and delightful characters, but to describe them will take a large space. I will, therefore, stop here.",1315008000,,6210,4.590950226244344

I just had to have the complete Lark Rise collection so that I could delve deeper into the story.  This collection is the best I've ever purchased, and a person truly can get lost in the lives and lifestyles of each character.  I was so sad when I finally had viewed the very last episode...yes, there were tears!  I intend to begin it all again some months from now, and I have no doubt that there will be little things that I may have not noticed the first time around.  Splendid acting, breathtaking period costumes, Lark Rise is pure genius, not merely ""entertainment"".",1312329600,,694,4.52
4214090,5,B003WEAW18,"This collection is a wonder and I heartily recommend it to fans of BBC work generally. I recommend it to fans of period work and wheat waving gently in the summer sun and the sweetness and complexity and wonderful lore of village life on the outskirts of the industrial revolution.

The cast is just marvelous and the writers and producers outstanding. When I wear out my four seasons I'll finally get around to reading what Flora Thompson wrote. Am not there yet, just letting this wonderful work make viewing addicts of the whole family as I am in the second time through with a younger generation who loves it as much as I do.

A little immersion and then going out and about feels just like being in Larkrise and Candleford. Major congratulations to the producers and writers and directors of the various episodes. Am still curious why exactly the series stopped. Of course, it stopped very well and the final episode satisfies even though I understand there are fans who don't want to let it go there.

See wikipedia for more on that and the cast and if anyone knows why it had to stop and where was Brendan Coyle while his character went to work in Oxford, please tell.",1310256000,2,1175,4.559241706161138

All the characters are well-defined and believable.  The scenery, costumes, and actors were well chosen.  Even though it's set in 19th century England, the issues and problems are very relevant--human nature never really changes.  Because they introduce new characters in most episodes, the series stays fresh while maintaining it's core set of actors. I'm just sorry it only goes to season 4. I've now got my adult daughter and her friend hooked on this as well. Like Pride and Prejudice, this is a series you can watch again and again.",1305849600,15,800,4.712230215827338
