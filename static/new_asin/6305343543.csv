7887872,4,6305343543,"'building a mystery' is pretty easy to pick up. chords, if you can do them, were well explained, but one problem is that she doesn't explain the strumming very much - seems to be along the lines of 'do what feels good' which isn't really great advise if you want to strum like she's strumming but can't figure out how to do it.",1174867200,,327,4.2063492063492065
7887873,4,6305343543,"I was taking lessons at the time, and frustrated since my instructor had a tendency to teach songs all out of order and we never really played any songs from beginning to end.  I borrowed this tape from a friend.  I was playing the first two songs fairly quickly. The only problem was playing the tape over and over and writing out the chords.  Forgot to see if this tape comes with a  book. That'd help a lot!  Not sure you could learn these songs with out previous guitar knowledge.  Some of the fingerings are a little tricky. Well they were for me! LOL I only had a few months of lessons, but Building a Mystery sounded decent within a shorter time than expected. :)'
4 stars if you already know some guitar, but not a first time learners video. Again better if it has a book.",1072483200,,780,4.272108843537415
