8188931,5,B000P520TO,"Bought this on album when it first came out, because I was able to see many of these acts back in the day in NYC and Philly. Years ago when I saw it was on VHS I had to grab it, the tape was out-of-print by then and going for big $$$ (was supposedly released on LaserDisc as well). The film had limited theatrical release, but has shown up on TV from time to time. Now it's on a Widescreen DVD and a no-brainer purchase, historical essential stuff. Many of the acts featured were managed by POLICE drummer Stewart Copeland's brother Miles, of I.R.S. Records fame, and many recorded for that label as well. I've always wondered if there were FULL sets of all the performers recorded, the rumor is each band had three songs each filmed.  Would make a great limited edition set, eh? Considering what a licensing nightmare this must be, we're luck to have it at all (unless Miles Copland gets all the $$$ anyhow). Here's the track/performer/song rundown, with the album the original recording can be found on afterwards for those of you that might want to dig deeper. I've also added ten links (the limit) to albums I feel are essential for a collection. Those marked (*) are on the double-album/cassette version. There was also a 21-track CD available at one time which is now useless, buy this.....!

Considering this is a DVD-R release, the picture and sound are great. Some are complaining about the ""bare bones"" lack of a proper menu and chapters, they should be glad it's available at such a reasonable price! The initial release had a generic Warner Archive sleeve, the pressings since have a photo of the film poster, which shows that this has sold quite a few copies so far). You never know when stuff like this will go out-of-print, so get it NOW! The only URGH! about this is...I want more.....!",1459987200,,5699,6.34020618556701
