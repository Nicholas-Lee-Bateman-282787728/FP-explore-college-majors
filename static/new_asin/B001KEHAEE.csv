3664331,3,B001KEHAEE,"Chronicling the life of English journalist George Hogg during WWII, ""The Children of Huang Shi"" attempts to show the atrocities faced by the Chinese people during the Japanese occupation of the country in the early stages of the war.

Hogg (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is an ambitious (albeit naive), young journalist trying to get to Nanjing. Under the guise of a Red Cross worker, he gains entrance, but quickly finds out this assignment will test all of his survival skills. His journalist peer (David Wenham) is killed, Hogg is stranded in Nanjing with an extremely aggressive (and murderous) force of Japanese soldiers, and to top it off, he is captured with the evidence of the atrocious behavior of the Japanese (killing of innocent villagers-men, women and children).

It is only the fortuitous presence of a Chinese Nationalist (played with tremendous credibility by Chow Yun-Fat) that Hogg eventually escapes, making his way to an orphanage, partially looked after by Lee Pearsons (played with a lack of credibility by Radha Mitchell-a fine actress, but not her brightest hour). Befriending the boys-scared, lonely, starving, and diseased-isn't Hogg's easiest task, but he manages to convey a strong sense of self in the children, aided by Merchant Wang's (Michelle Yeoh) advice and supplies.

Upon learning of the Japanese army's advancement into the orphanage territory, and knowing the boys could be conscripted at any time, Hogg decides to make the dangerous, 700 mile trek through the famous `Silk Road' (of Marco Polo fame). This is where this epic film should have risen to the occasion, with grandeur and wide-angle scope, but there is a definite disconnection with the viewer of the hardship faced by Hogg, Lee, and the children. The time feels shortened and compressed during the most challenging portion of the film, and when Hogg succumbs to tetanus, one feels cheated.

""The Children of Huang Shi"" had much potential, but fell a little flat overall. A 2.5 star effort, worth at least one viewing for a story many in the States are unaware of.",1233360000,4,2059,5.0828402366863905
3664332,4,B001KEHAEE,"THE CHILDREN OF HUANG SHI is a long (greater than two hours) epic tale that happens to be a true story of an extraordinary hero's life and gift to humanity during World War II.  If as a film the telling of this story is a bit shaky in spots, it is probably due to the episodic series of events that happened very quickly and under existing conditions of  profound stress.  Yet despite the occasional misfires in production this remains a bit of history we all should know.

George Hogg (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is a journalist assigned to Shanghai in 1937 and with his colleagues he plans to explore the extent of the invasion of China by the Japanese.  Under the guise of Red Cross workers his small band manages to enter Nanjing where now alone due to the loss of his friends to battle he observes and photographs the atrocities of mass murders of the people of Nanjing. He is captured by the Japanese, tortured when his confiscated camera reveals his terrifying photographs, and it is only by acts of fortune and the aid of a Chinese Nationalist Chen Hansheng (Chow Yun-Fat) that he escapes. Hogg probes the Chinese countryside for further evidences of the evil of the Japanese invasion, and he finds a village of children (adults are all absent) and realizes that he is in an orphanage without a leader.  At first reluctant to assume the role of guardian of these impoverished and filthy frightened children, he soon accepts his responsibility and is challenged by an Australian nurse Lee Pearson (Radha Mitchell) to become not only the caretaker but also the father/teacher/provider/role model these children so desperately need.

Seeing the advancing of the Japanese, Hogg decides to take his wards 700 mile away to a small village by the Gobi desert reachable only by the infamous Silk Road.  It is this journey and the way both the children and Hogg are affected by the challenge that absorb the greater part of the film.  Observing the transformation of George Hogg's view of the world is made credible by Jonathan Rhys Meyers' performance.  The cast of children often steals the limelight, but with supporting cast members such as Chow Yun-Fat, Radha Mitchell and Michelle Yeoh as an opium merchant the story never lacks color and character.  The look of the film is dark, but the message of this story is full of light.  Here is a bit of Chinese history we should all know!  Grady Harp, January 09",1232668800,21,2406,4.7272727272727275
3664333,5,B001KEHAEE,"This true story has it all.  I cried, laughed and cheered.  I would love to see it again; but, it's no longer on in any theater in Phoenix.  I will purchase the DVD as soon as it's out to share with family and friends.",1219190400,3,218,3.909090909090909
3664334,5,B001KEHAEE,"I agree with Flight Risk's review of this film on all accounts. I saw the movie last night, and could not help but be very moved by it. I am also glad that this man's obscure story is being told, as anyone can use it as an example for their life...I know that it has touched me greatly.

Technically a few flaws can be found, and most media reviewers are doing so, and completely missing the point of the movie. I do agree that a documentary version of Hogg's efforts really needs to be made, so that even more people can know the true history here, without the artistic embellishment. I also don't think that Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was really the best pick for portraying Hogg, as his pretty-boy looks somehow distracts from the character's believability, but his acting is touching nonetheless. The storytelling also does kind of move at a quick pace, and you really have to let what is being said here soak in through your eyes to your heart as it moves along -- that is, the realities of that era and being a child with no home or hope, which is what the story really is about. I think that these things are what has distracted the negative media reviewers from the beauty of the movie, unfortunately.

The story has very tragic points and I won't spoil them here. But I can say that during the final credits, some of the grown-up children that Hogg saved, give their thoughts on him and how he affected their lives, and what they feel they owe him. After the way the movie ends, combined with their sentiments, tears were a foregone conclusion for me and I don't cry at movies. Do see this film, if you are at all interested in Asian history, and children, and the inspiration of a life lived well, the way humans are meant to live -- in humble service to each other. I will definitely be purchasing this DVD when it's released and hopefully it will contain more backstory on Hogg and the children.",1215907200,24,1901,4.444126074498567
3664335,5,B001KEHAEE,"This is the true account of George Hogg (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), a young English journalist in China during the Japanese occupation of 1937. Initially there to cover the occupation and all that that entails, he and another journalist manage to infiltrate into an area where they are not welcome disguised as Red Cross workers. Things take an ugly turn, and George finds himself alone and wounded, captured by the Japanese, and about to be executed when he is rescued by a Chinese partisan. He is whisked away to a remote orphanage in the hills to recuperate, and what is at first only tolerated by the invalid becomes his mission in life.

With the help of the Chinese partisan (the great Chow Yun Fat) and a young Australian woman adventurer/nurse (Radha Mitchell), George undertakes an almost unbelievable task: to evacuate the sixty orphan boys in the orphanage he has turned into a school 700 miles through China mountain passes on the Silk Road to the edge of the Gobi Desert, to save them from being conscripted into war.

Beautifully filmed, the movie portrays mid-twentieth century China against breathtaking vistas and crowded cities amidst ancient buildings and sweeping deserts. The full vast scope of China is so gorgeously shown it makes you want to go there, and retells the story of George and his sixty young charges to a new generation of moviegoers who most likely have never heard of the Japanese Occupation. There is a beautiful score as well; the right music compliments a film, and this is all that and more.

I love a good historical drama well told, and there are no missteps here. This was an excellent film.",1208822400,69,1632,4.842293906810036

3664436,5,B001KEHAEE,"This is a magnificent DVD rendition of a True Story to honor British Journalist George Hogg, an Australian Nurse and a Chinese Resistance Leader who saved the lives of several orphan boys during the Rape of Nanking.  Literally, they walked hundreds of miles to a sanctuary known as Huang Shi.  In 1937, the British Journalist George Hogg smuggled himself across enemy lines to expose the atrocities during the Japanese occupation of China.  Although he was captured and injured by the Japanese Army, the Resistance Leader, Chen rescued Hogg and sent him into hiding at a remote orphanage.  Then, George Hogg developed deep friendships with the orphans, love for the Australian Nurse and timeless friendship with Chen.  Hogg displayed a rare courage and demonstrated the true purposes of life that leave any viewer of this DVD movie speechless and intrigued.
Included in this DVD is a behind-the-scene commentary that includes some adult Chinese men who were among the young orphans that George Hogg was the moving force to save them.  In the International War Crimes Tribunals of Nuremberg and the Hague, there is the emphasis on the universal natural law principle of civilization at the bar and the value of every individual human being before the dock when necessary where eugenics for race or creed was not allowed.  The world should recognize this:  A white man named George Hogg who was a leader in an effort that save several young Chinese boys - and others.",1434326400,5,1465,4.975409836065574

3664535,4,B001KEHAEE,"This is a heartwarming story and true to boot.  This is a story of a ""reluctant messiah"" (non religious) for a bunch of Chinese orphans during war.  Rhys-Meyers does a good performance as George Hogg, a newspaper reporter stranded in China during the invasion by the Japanese.  He ends up leading a group of orphaned boys hundreds of miles to safety.  The only bummer about the whole thing for me is that i so desperately wanted to read ""the book"" this film was made from and found out there was none.  This was not a ""GREAT"" film, that is why it only got 4 stars.",1351987200,,564,4.333333333333333
3664536,5,B001KEHAEE,"I was baffled looking at other less-than-stellar reviews of people who were just overly analytical.  The movie and actors played well in their roles.  The premise in and of itself is powerful- that is, it is based on the true story, and the producers shelled out a loss by making the movie just to tell the story.

Get over it.  This is a great movie.",1344470400,,351,4.3538461538461535
3664537,3,B001KEHAEE,"""The Children of Huang Shi"" is a smaller variation of ""Schindler's List"". Based on a true story, a young British man travels to Japanese occupied China in the 1930's and goes to great lengths to protect a large group of Chinese orphans, just as Schindler fought to protect a group of Jews in Germany. This is not a sweeping big budget war movie, but rather a smaller drama about the young British man and the Chinese orphans he saves. As such, it's fairly well made, but rather cliched. Leading man Meyers is okay, but leading woman Radha Mitchell does a bad job of acting, looking stiff. Maybe with good supporting actors Yun-Fat Chow and Michelle Yeoh, there was no money in the budget for a better female lead. If you're looking for an epic war movie, this is not it, but it is an okay drama set during a war. Reviewed 4/29/2009 after watching on DVD.",1326672000,,854,4.480769230769231

3664541,3,B001KEHAEE,"This movie started out pretty bold as George Hogg makes his way into occupied Nanjing and sees frightening atrocities. Captured by the Japanese and escaping by the slimmest margin, he finds himself eventually at an orphanage for boys and is forced by circumstance into the role of leader.
To this point it was an exciting story, but from here it slowed down considerably.  I can't claim to be a movie critic, but I can say that the movie took on a very restricted feeling at this time. I was reminded of special movie presentations for television. Safe, taking no chances, taking an exciting and very interesting story and almost boring us with it.
And the story itself is an amazing one. Hogg becomes a better person for his experiences and rises very much to the occasion. But even when there is a natural tension in the story, the storytelling is flat. I'm not sure that it is the fault of the actors. Certainly Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh can bring a lot to a movie. The other two actors, playing the lead roles, may have been fine, though they didn't inspire me particularly.  Their fault or that of the director? I'm not sure it matters.
In the end, I think it is an important story, and it was told in a very workmanlike way. But workmanlike isn't necessarily what you want from a good story.",1305504000,,1302,4.512711864406779

3664547,2,B001KEHAEE,"The story upon which this movie is based is fantastic---a tale of bravery and courage. However, this movie---a semi-fictionalized version of the real events---had some fatal flaws which undermined the power inherent in the tale.

But first, its positives:

1) Brilliant depictions of the horror of the Japanese occupation of China

2) Especially good (that is, disturbing) depiction of the Rape of Nanjing

3) Good use of Mandarin and Japanese interspersed with English.  So many movies do not mix languages well---this one pulled it off.

4) EXCELLENT ending, or post-ending:  using actual footage of the now-grown men whom Hogg helped rescue.  It was actually the most powerful part of the movie.

5) Chow Yun Fat is an excellent actor, and does not fail here.

And its deadly flaws:

1) The two main characters (Hogg and the nurse) were too pretty and had weak acting ability.  That combination made the movie seem FAKE and shallow.  Had they gotten average, normal-looking actors OF QUALITY the movie might have worked.

2) The shallow acting made the characters' motives and relationships with others seem cheesy.  Hollywood strikes again!  (Strikes out, that is.)

3) The romance was unnecessary and insincere.

So, overall:  I felt like I was watching Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie rescue more non-white orphans.  What's sad is that the real George Hogg, from what I gather (via the internet and from the profoundly sincere words of the actual people he nurtured), was no Brad Pitt.  He was the real deal.",1263600000,6,1511,5.012096774193548
3664548,5,B001KEHAEE,"An excellent movie. I highly recomend it to any Jonathan Rhys Meyers fans, and those who are interested in stories based on historical fact. This was also a good love story without falling into the ""chick flick"" catagory.",1256428800,,221,4.842105263157895

3664550,4,B001KEHAEE,"""The Children of Huang Shi"" is based on the true story of the English writer George Hogg, portrayed by Jonathon Rhys Meyers (The Tudors) and his quest to save the boys of a destitute orphanage. This takes place during the Japanese occupation of China around 1937. Radha Mitchell also stars in this movie as the nurse, Lee Pearson, who moved about China helping where she could. She travels with George and the boys on an extraordinary 700 mile hike to escape the Japanese. This trek takes them far into the bowels of China along Marco Polo's silk road in search of a safe place to live. The scenery is as amazing as the story. I highly recommend this movie.",1252713600,3,657,4.529411764705882
3664561,4,B001KEHAEE,"At two hours in length, this beautifully photographed biographical film is still not long enough to flesh out the underlying story we are encouraged to imagine. The movie makes a good companion piece to The Last Emperor, as a record of pre-WWII China. But I do not know of a movie that fills in the psychology of the starving boys orphaned and raised wild by older boys -- their dreams, their fears, their codes of honor. The civilizing work of George Hogg and his allies, and its unexpected consequences, amount to another movie within a movie. And then there is the arduous long trek through mountains and out into the high Gobi desert, which tells yet another story of courage and perseverance that could have been expanded to satisfy my curiosity about the journey. How many animals did they lose along the way? Did their provisions last? Did the vegetable seeds and rice and grain they took with them do as well in sand as in the lowland mud?",1250121600,4,947,4.609467455621302
3664562,5,B001KEHAEE,"This is a very special film. It belongs in the category of great films that include, ""Empire of the Sun"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""Band of Brothers"". Along with the growing collection of films detailing the lives of people who seemingly lose control of their life and then find the greatest rewards that life can give. This story is powerful and meaningful. Based on the true life experience of an amazing man. I recommend that you buy this film and watch it every year.

3664564,5,B001KEHAEE,"I was attracted to see this movie because it is set in late 1930s in China.  I personally knew very little about the internal civil war that was going on there between the imperial army and emerging communist force. It finally helepd me understand how Japanese had audacity to invade that country many times their size and keep it occupied throughtout the World War II.

Main chracter of the movie is a young British reporter George Hogg, an Oxford educated journalist.  His job took him initially to US, then Japan and finally to China.  Seeking to report in Europe what is truly happening in the far east, he finds his way to Shanghai in desire to reach Nanjing where Japanese occupying army is killing civilians.  However, fate has other plans in store for George.

George ends up in a countryside in an orphanage full of boys of all ages who know only of starvation and horrific loss of their families.  Slowly, George accepts his role of becoming their surrogate father, teacher and caretaker, until it becomes obcvious that Japanese army is closing in and Chinese army wishes to use boys for their own purposes as soldiers.

For fans who saw Michelle Yeoh in her former films, there is a surprise.  This agile, martial arts actress has transformed herself in a dignified, beautiful local merchant full of grace, quiet determination and wisdom.

3664568,4,B001KEHAEE,I enjoyed this movie and as with all movies it takes liberties with the facts if the reviews from the New Zealand websites are correct.  It's based on the biography of Mr. Hoggs - Ocean Devil written by James McCamus who was also the screenwriter of the movie.  Another movie with a similar storyline is The Inn of Sixth Happiness with Ingrid Bergman.  There are some casting issues but it's still an interesting story.  That movie is based on the biography about a British woman Gladys Alyward who takes 100 children over the mountains in China to safety: The Small Woman by Alan Burgess.,1235606400,,589,4.634615384615385

8314679,5,B001KEHAEE,"Occasionally you'll come across a story that is so inconceivable, so profound, so caring it seems to be nothing more than fiction.

The Children of Huang Shi is one such story.  This is the story is George Hogg, a pacifist from England in China at the onset of WWII.  Making good way to Nanjing, George witnesses the cruelty of the Japanese towards the people of Nanjing.  Meeting up with freedom fighter Jack (Chow Yun-Fat) and Lee (Radha Mitchell), an English nurse, George is taken to to an orphanage to see firsthand the result of the horrors witnessed.

Ultimately, Lee, Jack and George lead near a hundred orphans more than 200 miles, the course of two months, over mountains in the winter to the relative safety of an inland province along the Yellow River.

My review cannot possibly do the moving story justice.  Too many times throughout the movie emotions overcame me to leave me weeping silently.
