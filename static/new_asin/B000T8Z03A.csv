8208090,4,B000T8Z03A,"Many death metal bands on this compilation, with video as well. I bought this to sample other bands and to see their live performances or videos.",1520812800,,145,4.615384615384615
8208091,1,B000T8Z03A,It didn't play in my bluray DVD player at all. It isn't regionally encoded but I was frustrated that it has so many videos and I want to watch them so bad! Something is seriously wrong with the discs and I am not satisfied with a product that won't work.,1473724800,,254,4.1
8208092,4,B000T8Z03A,Highly recommend it but I would like to know one thing and that is who is the actor that played the part of the old man that was the zombie in the video for Death Walking Terror by Cannibal Corpse because he looks alot like Anthony Hopkins but I know it ain't him.,1369008000,2,264,4.0
