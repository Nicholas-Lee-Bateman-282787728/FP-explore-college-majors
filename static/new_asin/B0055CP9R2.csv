4573409,5,B0055CP9R2,"The opening shot is in a sunny neighborhood in Ventura California. The smell is white hyacinth. It reminds us of the 70's and this was a happy time in america. Liddsville and freakies cereal and that dune buggy that had eyes and talked, inch high private eye. Kids played in the sun, everyone was tan, no kid was on drugs and corporations only sold sugary cereal and breakable whammo super balls. All boys played little league, and an occasional girl, and chewed bubbs daddy gum in these long sticks. We never wore helmets and were always falling off our bikes. Wooden ramps were on the sidewalks and homemade mini bikes with lawnmower engines roamed america. Evil Kneivel told me nothing was impossibe, causing a lot of bike wrecks. The economy was strong and every family had houses and had birthday parties. Little girls had boyfriends. You ate at the table and said grace, it only got cloudy during the week, the weekends were always clear. Everyone was happy, what happened? No one was arguing or fighting,  parents were young and kids were smart. Pain didn't exist. There is so much pain now. I just want the kids of today to know they are so cheated now! The parents of the 70's came from the 50's. They were poor and had nothing, so we always got a million presents at christmas. Innocence ruled and pain was not heard of. On January 16th though, the spell was broken and the happy times died, may we all remeber garry jr.",1377475200,2,1430,4.56420233463035
4573410,5,B0055CP9R2,One of the great Kroft shows from my childhood. Unless you grew up with it you probably don't understand it and it might seem really lame. Hey it is what I grew up with.,1376179200,,169,4.0
4573411,5,B0055CP9R2,Wanted to share some innocent and caring cartoons from my childhood with my grandchildren and Amazon had it. Found this charming show and instantly bought it. I loved it then and my grandkids love it now. There is no bad language or sex and the only violence is sea monster on sea monster and it is slapstick at that. This is a show that I feel all kids should see. Thanks for having it.,1370390400,4,387,4.243243243243243
4573412,5,B0055CP9R2,I used to watch this on Saturday mornings back in the early 70's and had very fond memories of the show. By todays standards it is dated but never the less fun to watch. I would highly recommend this to anyone of our age group that remembered Saturday morning cartoons and kid shows of the late 60's and early 70's. Also I think that young kids today might like the show.,1366761600,7,371,4.23943661971831
4573413,5,B0055CP9R2,"The show centered on two brothers, Johnny (Johnny Whitaker) and Scott Stuart (Scott Kolden), who discover Sigmund (Billy Barty), a friendly young sea monster who had been thrown out by his comically dysfunctional undersea family for refusing to frighten people. The boys hide Sigmund in their clubhouse. This 3 DVD set of Series 1 contains all 17 episodes plus features such as commentaries with Johnny and Scott! As you know from watching Sigmund and the Sea Monsters, the plotlines were very simple and straightforward, usually some variation on the idea of Sigmund doing something silly to arouse attention, and the boys working to prevent him from being found by Sigmund's brother monsters, Blurp (Bill Germaine, Larry Larsen) and Slurp (Fred Spencer, Paul Gale). The brothers also worked to hide Sigmund from their overbearing housekeeper Zelda (Mary Wickes), elderly neighbor Mrs. Eldels (Margaret Hamilton) and Sheriff Chuck Bevans (Joe Higgins). Zelda was the boys' housekeeper while their parents were away on vacation. The parents were never seen on the show, nor did they return home by the end of the series. With over 434 minutes of Sigmund fun!

The episodes included songs as part of the plot development, the character(s), generally Johnny, would sing a song about what he was thinking or feeling about something going on in his life, from things that made him happy to anxiety about girls.",1357689600,6,1406,5.139737991266376

4573415,5,B0055CP9R2,"Although I had the ""Best of"" DVD, I missed out on getting Rhino's original First Season release since I wanted the whole show.  I really regret not picking it up.  But now here's a second chance.  I'm hoping my single purchase will persuade this company to do future Krofft releases; particularly the rest of Sigmund.  I was 7 or 8 when I first started watching the show...watched them over and over every Saturday morning.  In fact, this is among a group of shows (along with Filmation stuff, Hudson Brothers Razzle Dazzle, etc) that takes me back to my childhood like a personal time machine to the 60s, 70s and 80s.  It seems ridiculous at 45 to still be watching these shows.  But somehow I find it still entertaining as well as comforting to sit down to it on Saturday mornings like old times.

The visual/audio quality is exactly the way it should be.  Sure, I'm a collector of old show but if this looked like it was made yesterday with overdone cleanup I'd be oddly disappointed.  Not to say it looks bad, it just looks like 1970s TV on your 42"" plasma.  That's a good thing.  ;)

I really like that packaging for the same reason.  THIS is how it should have looked when Rhino did it, but they chose a minimalist approach with just Sigmund on the front.  Here we get something with over-saturated color like the 1970s really was.  Perfect!  Awesome job.  The packaging isn't quite as good as what they did with Pufnstuff (loved that big shot of Witcheepoo on the back!) but it looks like it belongs in the 1970s.

I've only viewed 1 extra so far, the ""commentary"" from the first episode by Sid Krofft is actually more like interview material played over the episode.  It's informative and Sid seems like a super person.  He seems to want to defend their creations endlessly but he really need not to that... folks like me, even at 45, still adore this stuff.",1316217600,32,1866,4.51044776119403

8457937,1,B0055CP9R2,"The Sid and Marty Krofft shows were somewhat of the pinnacle of early live action Saturday mornings (although that's not really saying much, if you ever catch an episode of the 70s ""Ghostbusters""). Somewhat a kid's fantasy world (as today, the more realistic the live action, the more tangible the fantasy), these shows offered something different from the run-of-the-mill animated series (most mirroring Scooby-Doo, by this time). Then again, they were often no more than Keystone Kops humor in theme park costumes.",1407715200,,516,5.304878048780488
