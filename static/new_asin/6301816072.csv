Wonderful cast, brilliantly produced and with excellent music.  What more could one ask for?",1379808000,,262,4.3061224489795915
7816049,5,6301816072,"This opera, recorded live, in performance,  at the Salzburg Festival in the early '60s is nonpariel -- cast, (Schwartzkopf, Edelman, Jurinach, Rothenberger) conductor, (Karajan) orchestra, (the Vienna Philharmonic) maganificent sets and costumes.  Glorious music by Richard Strauss -- what more could one ask for?",1361664000,2,313,6.090909090909091
7816050,5,6301816072,"Although a bit dated and without English sub-titles, it was a wonderful experience to view the tapes.  The singers were  in their prime and the orchestra was - as obviously expected - excellent.  If a DVD copy is somewhere available, I would like to know.

7816051,4,6301816072,"from my limited experience i believe that elizabeth schwarzkopf is the finest soprano of the twentieth century.  She is a fine actress and has incredible flexibility in her voice giving her the ability to give each phrase a unique expressivness.  When one listens to her voice one knows instinctively whether she is asking a question, musing about some thought or making a declamatory statement. All of these atributes are all the more apealing because physically she a very beutiful woman. Thank you.",1149724800,15,501,5.097560975609756
7816052,4,6301816072,"I have never been a Schwarzkopf fan and for the past 18 years preferred R&eacute;gine Crespin's Marschallin (on Decca), even in the complete Solti recording, where her voice allegedly was in decline (critics are always  happy to point out these imperfections). I also never warmed up to Otto  Edelmann's Baron Ochs, and felt his timbre gives the role a cunning/evil  twist rather than a comic one (I prefer Manfred Jungwirth). My first  reaction to this tape was that the production is conservative and  unimaginative, compared for example with the newer Covent Garden production  with Solti and Te Kanawa. However, on repeat viewing I finally gave in - I  feel the critics were right all these years and Schwarzkopf IS the greatest  Marschallin ever. I still am not a fan of hers as a voice - Crespin's  voluptuous voice and seductive yet motherly characterization are a rare  gem. Yet Schwarzkopf's interpretation is highly intelligent and very subtle  (it took me 18 years to appreciate it). It is a very unusual role of a  lover who displays rare wisdom and maturity in her love and understands  when to let her lover go as an act of love. Schwarzkopf displays a deep  understanding of the Marschallin's dilemma and choice with very fine  nuances of singing and acting. I felt that watching her acting added depth  to just listening to her on discs. In that sense the very restrained  production serves to highlight Schwarzkopf's nuances. Even Otto Edelmann's  Baron Ochs is more complete when viewed on stage. His baron Ochs is a  stupid, crude and conniving character, rather than funny, and as a result  it is more difficult to forgive him (he's never really silly). He  represents the complete antithesis to the Marschallin's truly noble  handling of her love object - he wants to grab, hold on to, use and thereby  demean his chosen one. Their conception of these roles is highly idiomatic  and no singer who wasn't raised on the German language can quite match  that. They project a degree of self confidence in these roles that comes  with the experience of many live performances together - they rarely look  in the direction of the conductor to get their cues. This film is a  classic.",947548800,100,2198,4.836021505376344
