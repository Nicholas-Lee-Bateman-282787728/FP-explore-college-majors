7154684,5,B00WV7TNEE,"Can't beat 6 50s sci-fi films at a great bargain considering these were available manufactured on demand at $20-25 each! Best of all,  the superb transfers are the same as the Columbia MODs in their proper aspect ratios! No obvious compression issues either!",1438992000,3,258,5.0
7154685,4,B00WV7TNEE,"At about $2 a movie depending on Amazon's current pricing, it is hard to go too wrong. Chances are if you are considering this purchase you are a fan of 50s/60s Sci Fi so you know what you are getting into.

The really good news is these are all great prints. The 2 Japanese movies are in color while the rest are B&W. No extras.

I actually liked The Night The World Exploded better then the other reviewers here even though it wasn't at night and the world didn't explode. Seemed very typical to me of many other entries where scientists race against time to save the world while being completely oblivious to the girl mooning over him.

Personally I am not a big fan of the Japanese movies outside the original Gojira (and even the Americanized version Godzilla) Of the two on here I liked Battle in Outer Space much better as I could follow that story. H Man seemed to really be disjointed and I can only imagine it was the editing for American audiences. At the end, our hero is asked if it is over and he says it isn't then literally less then a minute later the head scientist is holding a news conference announcing it is over. By then I was hoping he was right. I'm not sure what was going on. There was this creeping black ooze that seemed to just creep. There were the greenish glowing sort of human forms and there was a guy trying to find a stash of heroin in the sewer systems. Seriously. I guess that is where the ""H"" comes from. Maybe I just wasn't paying enough attention to this one.

The 27th Day is another friendly alien trying to teach us a lesson about our atomic ways. Starring Gene Barry, I was expecting better from what reads like an interesting concept in the liner notes. Not much happens for a whole lot of this movie.

Valley of the Dragons is a pretty typical men get stuck in prehistoric times and hot cave girls fall for them flick. The opening comet effect was pretty well done. The ""Dragons"" appear to be close ups of Iguanas and Geckos.

12 to the Moon wasn't bad as again the aliens are forced to teach us lessons about our atomic ways.

Nothing great, but largely likable (well except for the H Man). If Amazon had half stars I probably would have gone 3 1/2 but moved it up to 4 due to how good they look.",1438560000,33,2245,4.28066037735849

7154690,4,B00WV7TNEE,"Nice inexpensive package of some hard to find films mixed with a couple of Japanese films with superior releases elsewhere.

SPOILER ALERT: 12 to the Moon is your typical ""let's all get along"" film from the 1950s with an international group of UN types on their way to the Moon. They anger aliens with their visit and bad things happen on earth. The lame conclusion (Aliens are so impressed by humanity's character they stop killing earth and claim everyone was in ""suspended animation"" anyway) just disappoints. Ditto The 27th Day, with more superior aliens teaching us how to live. Yawn.

Valley of the Dragons is an adaptation of Jules Vern's Off on a Comet. Two men about to fight a duel are swept off of earth by a near collision with a comet. Dinosaurs and cave people abound. The Night the World Exploded is so bad it is scary, but it does have the female lead from The 7th Voyage of Sindbad, (as ""Hutch"") so there is eye candy in this tale of the earth flying off its axis or something.

If you're buying this set for the Japanese films, better go buy the icons of Science Fiction Toho Collection instead. The H-Man is edited for content here, and poorly. At least the Toho Collection provides the Japanese uncut version as well. That is not included here. Battle In Outer Space is fine, with the US print not significantly different from the Japanese. Sadly, the prequel to Battle In Outer Space, the far superior The Mysterians, is out of print and hard to find, and should have been collected here, too.",1437868800,69,1514,4.5793357933579335
7154691,3,B00WV7TNEE,"Six sci-fi flicks on two single sided dual layer discs. That's squeezing quite a bit of material onto those little discs but overall the features all look pretty good, all with nice transfers provided by Columbia Pictures and all in their original theatrical ratios. You get two Japanese dubbed features in CinemaScope and color, 1958's ""The H-Man"" and 1960's ""Battle in Outer Space"", both with so-so special effects and the usual atrocious dubbing which may give you a few chuckles. Then there is the Sam Katzman produced snoozer ""The Night the World Exploded"" with Kathryn Grant and by comparison considerably better (but still not great!) ""The 27th Day"" with Gene Barry, both from 1957. Finally a couple of (in my opinion at least!) real duds, ""12 to the Moon"" from 1959 and ""Valley of the Dragons"" from 1961. I'd never seen either but had trouble staying awake for both.

Nothing really great here but you do more than get your money's worth and the films (from pretty good to BAD!) bring back fond memories of Saturday matinees and dusk-to-dawn movie marathons at drive in theaters way back in the day. As mentioned previously the films all have original theatrical aspect ratios, 2:35 to 1 for the two Japanese 'Scope films and 1:85:1 for the other four films and that's always a good thing. No extras or scene menus, only a very few chapter stops on each feature. Recommended for fans of 1950's shlock, not so much for most younger audiences who will most likely be extremely bored.",1437609600,106,1489,4.793774319066148

7154719,4,B00WV7TNEE,"Pretty standard fare for late 50s early 60s science fiction.  The quality of the transfer is pretty good considering three movies per disc.  My only issue is with the packaging.  I ordered two of these by accident.  Im kind of glad I did (only about $9.00 more). The flange for one of the discs in both of the cases were broken and just flopping around the inside of the case.  One of the other discs wasn't seated in the retaining ring and was scratched up pretty badly.  To the point the disc would freeze in my player.  I decided to just use each of the cases for one of the discs and pitch the rest.

The 27th Day (1959  B&W) is probably the best of the bunch.  But I like my science fiction more character and story driven rather than a bunch of explosions and blasters.  Dont get me wrong, there are a number of plot holes big enough to drive trucks through, but still a good character driven story using aliens and the possibility of Armageddon.  Like most of the alien visitation stories of the period, the aliens come to Earth to warn of the threat humans pose to the rest of the (presumably) peaceful galactic community because of their new-found harnessing of atomic energy.

The Night The World Exploded (1957 - B&W) is full of the usual stereotypes of the era.  Scientist creates a method for predicting earthquakes.  Goes to warn the authorities, but because its untested, they hope it doesnt happen (not even warning the populace) with predictable results.  Scientist is completely immersed in his work, completely oblivious to the beautiful scientist who is absolutely crazy about him.  The interesting thing about this movie is the intercutting of actual disaster (fires, earthquakes, building demolitions, etc.) footage into the film.

The H-Man (1959  Color)  A Japanese movie which makes me think of The Blob.  But instead of being an alien, the monster is man-made due to all the H Bomb tests conducted in the Pacific.  Full of the usual Japanese stereotypes  gangsters, hard-boiled cops, young scientist who falls for a nightclub singer who was the girlfriend of a gangster everyone thinks has been dissolved.  Wait until you see how they destroy the monsters.  Its laugh out loud funny.  But, considering the time frame

12 To The Moon (1960  Color)  An international team of 12 astronauts voyages to the moon.  Finds an alien intelligence who thinks humans are dangerous and must be destroyed.  Even to the point of putting the Earth itself into a deep freeze.
International crewmembers include a square-jawed American, an American wunderkind (19 yrs old) scientist, a German, Israeli, Swede, Japanese, Russian, Turkey, France, Britain, Nigerian (Muslim), Brazilian.  Dont know how this crew was put together with crewmembers exhibiting outright hostility towards one another (Israeli vs. Russian), scientists acting entirely unscientific (sticking hands into a molten flow), and one of the most lovely astronauts Ive ever seen (Anna-Lisa).  Whats not to like?  Just don't expect any internal logic.  Oh, and check out the dog, two cats, two monkeys, and two birds as well as the lawn chairs and plastic cafeteria chairs used on the ship.

Battle In Outer Space (1959 - Color) Japanese with yet another international organization controlling spaceflight.  Story opens with a space station being destroyed by three alien ships (flying saucer type).  Its determined aliens are using the Moon as a base of operations to launch the attacks.  Two ships are sent to the Moon to counter-attack.  Primarily crewed by Japanese crewmembers, there are a number of other nationalities included.  It kind of reminded me of the Gerry Anderson productions out of England.

All 6 movies go well together. If you like one you will probably like the others. I thought overall the set was very well done. Picture and sound quality are good. Very nice budget set of movies in a nice package. A 2 disc set with six movies I got mine 6 dollars I would call that a very good deal just one dollar per movie.

7154751,4,B00WV7TNEE,"Ishiro Honda was an excellent director and the H-Man (original title is often cited as Beauty and the Liquid Man) is one of his best. The film is a crime drama/sci-fi hybrid with some elements of horror. It's about a police investigation into the disappearance of a criminal who vanished leaving only his clothes behind. A scientist has evidence that radioactive  liquid monsters are causing people to dissolve. The H-Man is on a par with the best sci-fi has to offer and deserves a wider audience. Honda was less well-known for films like The H-Man and Matango than he was for his giant monster movies but, now that the film is more widely available, that may change. The Mill Creek Vintage Sci-Fi set has the dubbed American edit but it's still great and the editing was minor as near as I can tell, at least in comparison with the hack jobs other Toho films endured for their American releases. I showed it to a friend recently who complained she didn't want it to end. The entire sequence on the boat as sailors tell about their encounter with a ""ghost ship"" is among the most memorable in the annals of sci-fi movie history, I think. It's the first one of several great scenes. The attack at the nightclub in the film's second half is also great as is the dramatic conclusion. That's three great scenes and no bad scenes. Howard Hawks would be pleased. Just writing about makes me want to watch it again. I've watched it four times over the last month already. It's one of my all-time faves.
The 27th Day is also very good and overcomes it's low budget with a serious, thoughtful script, good acting, and plenty of tension. The film centers on a group of human beings from different national backgrounds who are given the unenviable task of holding the fate of the world in their hands at the behest of an alien race. Can they hold out until the 27th day without annihilating themselves?
In Battle in Outer Space Ishiro Honda shows his knack for gorgeous technicolor visuals, well-composed shots, and an entertaining story. An alien race has established a base on the moon from which they plan to launch an attack against Earth. The world sends two international crews to the moon in response and the laser-blasting fun begins. Great model work in this one. Watch for the destruction of Tokyo's Cinerama Theatre.
The Night the World Exploded is a competent well-plotted story about a geologist whose discovers a highly unstable element just under the surface of the Earth. Like the 27th Day, it exists within its means and makes the most of it.
In 12 to the Moon, after discovering a civilization beneath the moon's surface, the crew of the Lunar Eagle 1 learns that the Earth has been frozen by the aliens in their absence. A nuclear device might be the key to ending the freeze. This entry is not as strong as the four already mentioned. It's a rather hum-drum affair for most of its run but picks up near the end.
Valley of the Dragons. Where to begin? I want to call this the worst film on an otherwise pretty decent set but it really is rather entertaining. The story is loosely based on the tale Off on a Comet by Jules Verne and is about two 19th century men who, in the midst of a duel, are whisked off by a passing meteor and find themselves trapped on a prehistoric planet. On the upside, a lot happens. On the downside, a lot of what happens is stuff you've seen before, right down to the giant, and rather lifeless, spider who was previously employed in a nearly identical scene in World Without End years earlier.  If you've seen Rodan, One Million B.C., Cat-Women of the Moon, and perhaps a few others, then you've already seen parts of this movie because it shamelessly lifts nearly all of its special effects shots from these other films. Sluposaurs abound! And so does Joan Staley's cleavage!",1468800000,5,3814,4.590909090909091

I bought it for the move The 27th Day since my single copy was non-functional and the vendor would not replace it or refund my money. It is the best film of the six. I liked the H Man the least.

The H Man (the Japanese version of our Blob) has decent EastmanColor (the monster looks green sometimes as he was in the original so I know we're close on),  fair clarity and the right aspect ratio. The 27th Day is a high concept premise carried through by a competent cast and thought-provoking story by John Mantley.

7154774,5,B00WV7TNEE,"You get six Columbia released sci-fi movies:

The Night the World Exploded (a cheap monochrome 59 minute film with the gorgeous Kathryn Grant)
The 27th Day (a terrific but underplayed alien ultimatum film, very talky but intelligent stuff, very few effects)
12 to the Moon (not seen it yet, not read very good things!)
The H Man (US dubbed Japanese sci-fi from Toho, lovely looking film)
Battle in Outer Space (another US dubbed Toho film with effects galore, space ships, moonbases, explosions, destruction, you name it!)
and
Valley of the Dragons (a very cheap Hollywood film which borrows endless 'dinosaur' footage from One Million BC and therefore has to essentially borrow the same plot!).

For a couple of dollars, it's a bargain even though some of the film's are a bit rubbish. H Man, Battle and 27th Day are worth the price alone. The others are just bonuses.

A nice mix of some very bad to some not so bad movies. I would recommend if that's your genre.  All the films have good to quite good transfers and are way above the VHS quality in some Mill Creek Mega sets.

The set comes with 2 discs - 3 films to each disc.  There is a slight menu where you chose which of the 3 films to watch.  No other menu options.  None of the films have subtitles or closed captioning.  There are 4 chapter stops in each film.

Only Battle in Outer Space and H-Man are color.  These two films are also letterbox.  The other 4 films are B&W and presented in 16:9 format.

Check out their helmets; no protection over their faces. Chairs they laid on for takeoff looked like beach chairs. Guess that is what it was like in movie making then. Had a blast watching all of these movies and well worth the price. Very interesting how much Hollywood mvie magic has progressed.

7154789,4,B00WV7TNEE,"Just finished watching ""Vintage Sci-Fi - 6 Movie Collection"" released by Mill Creek Entertainment.
Of the six movies in this DVD collection - which are Columbia Pictures releases -I have previously watched and reviewed independently ""Battle In Outer Space"" and ""The H-Man"" which are terrific, must see movies for lovers of vintage science fiction movies.
Of the remaining movies in this collection; ""The 27th Day"" is perhaps the most intriguing to me.  I remember discovering and reading  the novel the movie is based on in on the shelves in the science fiction section of Twice Told Tales, a used bookstore that was near the New River Shopping Center in Jacksonville, North Carolina nearly 40 years ago - it's long out of business; but it was like the Chamblin Bookmine here in Jacksonville, Florida.  It's an intense melodrama about what happens when five people are given the means by aliens to destroy the world.  I still have it somewhere in my bookshelves.
""The Night The World Exploded"" is a good attempt at a B-movie.  Want to destroy the world with a new mineral?  Just add water!  A bit far-fetched, but worth watching.
Now ""12 To The Moon"" is very intriguing because not only because of the acceptability of inter-racial romance; but there are hints of gay romance on the side between some of the male astronauts.
Skip ""Valley Of The Dragons.""  Bad acting, bad story, and bad special effects.  I stopped watching about 30 minutes into this KER-STINKER!
Well worth the price of admission for 5 great movies!
Strongly Recommended!

I LOVE  the 27th Day and that is why I purchased this set!  I am watching ""Battle in Outer Space"" as I type this out.  I would have rated this at least a 5 if not for the overly heavy handed religion in 12 to the Moon.  LET THIS SERVE AS A WARNING TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO LOVE THIS SET... AVOID ""12 TO THE MOON"".  If you are a religious NUT then you will love that movie!  This has no bearing on the FABULOUS  company that I ordered this from!  All the other movies were GREAT.
