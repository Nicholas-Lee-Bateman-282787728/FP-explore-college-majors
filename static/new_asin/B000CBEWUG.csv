8096612,4,B000CBEWUG,"In this police drama about the British ""internal affairs,"" we have an ""anti-hero"" protagonist who wrecks his marriage and nearly wrecks his career but somehow remains likable, or at least not detestable. Even more likable, though, are the man and woman who work just under him; indeed I think it is these two who make an emotional connection with the viewer and make the show work. ""Class"" is very much a theme of the drama and it's clear that the nominal hero has advanced to his position in part because he is relatively well-born and well-spoken, whereas the pair who work for him will have to work harder for advancement because they are not ""born for management"" as he is. Indeed, the woman is bisexual which was probably somewhat shocking when the show aired in England. Most of the villainous policemen whom they try to arrest are quite upper class which is one reason why too many of them elude justice. The first two seasons are just plain fun to watch, and they were a smash hit in England when they aired, perhaps because it was the first to present the police in a non-too-favorable light. I should add a note, however, on the subject of DVD ""regions."" This show remains ""region 2,"" which will not play on purely American machines, and I doubt it will ever be re-issued as a region 1 product. If, like our family, you enjoy well-made British (and French) television, you may find, as we did, that purchasing one of the ""all-region"" DVD players on Amazon is well-worth the price!",1370649600,3,1490,4.626415094339623
8096613,4,B000CBEWUG,"It has interesting story lines and, as the previous reviewer states, neat, everybody happy type endings you don't get.  Neil Pearson is a very good actor who was in a wonderfully nutty Brit series called 'Drop the dead donkey'.

'Between The Lines' captivated my American wife, as has most of the Brit detective series.  Guns are rare but made up for by more 'in your face' gruesome murders with a variety of weapons.",1366329600,2,417,4.684931506849315
8096614,5,B000CBEWUG,"Only on British DVD, this is a classic police series with a twist .. it's about the police investigating the police. And almost every episode ends badly. Each episode builds on the previous and you'll need to watch series 1 first.",1365465600,5,230,4.634146341463414
