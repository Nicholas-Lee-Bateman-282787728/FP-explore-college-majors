8589106,5,B00D3O24NG,"At last, a Pessaro production that is actually viewable and enjoyable!  Gorgeous yet phantasmagorical, it made me think on the cultural artifacts that defined the beginning of Western culture, and their current extermination at the hands of fundamentalists.  There is a detail here: the costumes DO reflect Babilonian styles, if through the eye of 21st C. sensibility.  Podles floored me, and so did Jessica Pratt--in both cases, I rushed to see what else by either lady could be found.  Definitely a feast for both the eyes and the ears.  Kudos to all involved.",1427155200,,562,5.0
8589107,5,B00D3O24NG,"Ewa Podles is moving in this and the star of the show. I like the production although a friend did not for some reason.

The staging is set as actors in a black and white silent film, and the audience as the chorus. A kid from the audience jumps into the opera too. The background is at times projected upon by flickering film clips and at points by the singers making faces and stuff. I liked it.",1408752000,,397,4.1558441558441555

8589109,4,B00D3O24NG,"Whether she's singing the telephone book, or individual arias listen to madam podles.  A distinctive voice, used with distinctive artistry.  As opera singers become more  and more homogenized, listen well and appreciate that today's recording equipment is  technically sophisticated - not scratchy old analog.  Enjoy a dying era of singing when artists and audiences embraced and savored individuality.  Shame on the met and like minded critics for shunning madam podles, like madam dormitories before her.",1399852800,2,506,5.68
8589110,5,B00D3O24NG,"I have three live audio performances of this early Rossini opera in my collection and never thought very highly of the piece. Sure it has its moments, but the young Rossini seemed too inexperienced to grasp what little drama was in the admittedly weak libretto.  Of course to bring off Rossini a stellar cast of experienced singing actors is needed.  None of those earlier recordings even comes close to providing a cast of singers capable of doing justice to the piece.

With this recording which is scrupulously prepared, conducted, and performed so as to be effective both vocally and dramatically a veil seems to be have been lifted revealing a score compiled by a quite skillful young man. Yes, it is the work a composer still learning his craft and as such it can be compared to the pre Idomeneo operas of Mozart which reveal similar weaknesses. Still, while both composers were to reach greater heights in their short operatic careers, these early pieces are certainly harbingers of what was still to come. As such they should be relished and appreciated for what they are.  That the score of Ciro contains enough good tunes to keep one captivated for the duration of the piece is testament to the fecundity of Rossini's inspiration even at such an early age.  Akin to those early Mozart pieces, Ciro in Babilonia is of its time and place. As such it is representative of the type of opera that was prevalent at that point in time. That Rossini was able to fashion a quite decent opera based on the traditions of the time is certainly evidence of his budding genius. Putting this piece in perspective and knowing his later and greater operas, certainly makes one realize how he changed, molded, and eventually set the standards for the operatic world for decades to come.

As to the performance itself, I find no weaknesses and given that Will Crutchfield is the conductor guarantees authenticity grounded in sound scholarship.  While I somehow feel compelled to give special praise to Ewa Podles, Jessica Pratt, and Michael Spryes, that is patently unfair to the remainder of the cast as all excel in and are comfortable with the Rossini style... and as alluded to above... that indicates that all deliver their difficult coloratura roles not only with with virtual vocal perfection, but also with dramatic conviction.  I am not even bothered by the silent movie concept of the production as the costumes are evocative of the ancient setting, albeit with a not inappropriate ""Roaring Twenties"" point of view.

If you like Rossini, Bel Canto, or just great singing this is worth exploring. It will also give you some insight into the history of Italian opera and the not so small part the young Rossini contributed to its development.",1393977600,,2741,4.852248394004283
8589111,4,B00D3O24NG,"Not a great opera, but the singing is great  Podles steals the show.  However, the production is absolutely ridiculous, almost makes watching impossible.",1385942400,4,153,5.608695652173913
8589112,3,B00D3O24NG,"I'm not quite sure about this one. At first I was disturbed because it seemed not to adhere to what I expect  of a real performance.  Sets, costume, etc.  This one has an ""updated"" presentation, done like a silent movie.  When I got the idea and began to ""get with it,"" I felt jarred by the disruption of the gimmicky of continued flickering of the silent movie camera.  I felt that business was overdone.
I plan to view it several more times, the artists are fine and I guess there isn't any way the modern directors and stagers can really completely wreck a work of a Master. The costumes are a Blast and I suppose I will credit the work with being ""all of a piece"" and consistant in its way of the conception for us ""Today.""",1382918400,3,727,4.2773722627737225
8589113,5,B00D3O24NG,"The twenty year old Gioachino Rossini had been writing musical numbers since he was twelve. In 1810 he assembled a first opera ""Demetrio e Polibio"" not performed until 1812. This was followed by a few ""farces"" in 1810 and 1811. Finally in 1812 he tried his hand at an opera that could be given by a theatre during the Lenten season. It had to be uplifting and preferably a biblical story. He decided on something from the book of Daniel about Balshazzar, the feast and the hand writing on the wall but this would not be long enough for a two act piece that he wanted. He the worked with a local poetaster to add a romantic element Cyrus and his wife Amira with some story lines taken from Herodotus about the triumph of Cyrus over Belshazzar a Babylonia. The work is entitled ""Ciro in Babilonia"".
The music is varied in quality but the arias are excellent. He was already a master of the Bel Canto style and the writing for the three principals, Ciro (Cyrus) contralto, Baldassare (Belshazzar) lyric tenor and Amira, prima soprano are all show-stopping display pieces. Alas the music in between is not all of high quality as would come later. However he was writing fast a furious and of higher and higher quality. He produced three more comedies (still performed) in 1812 1nd 1813 and late in 1813 he did his first masterpiece Tancredi.
So Ciro in Babilonia would not be a likely choice for a full-fledged, staged revival although it has some great individual numbers in it. However the inspired creative team of Will Crutchfield and Davide Livermore dreamed-up a way to do it. Do it as a silent movie, C. B. de Mille biblical extravaganza with movie-flickering, exaggerated make-up, costumes, lighting, video clips and exaggerated gestures. The audience for the movie is the chorus of the opera. The result is a magnificent revival featuring great artists at their best.
Ewa Podles id the reining contralto of the day. Unfortunately there are few parts and very few parts of any length for this voice range. Rossini wrote this for his friend Maria Marcolini - a famous bell canto contralto of the day. Ms. Podles is just right for it, great versatility, excellent diction and technique and a rich, robust voice. She is the shining star.
Michael Spyres has just the right lyric tenor and bel canto technique to carry off the role of Baldassare. His numbers are most challenging but he comes off very well.
We have already heard the exquisite vocal technique of Jessica Pratt in ""Adelaide di Borgogna"", a later Rossini composition. Here she with her Theda Bara costume and make-up commands the stage with bel canto flourishes. (f.y.i. Theda Bara is an anagram of Arab death). For the vocally limited secunda soprano (Argene) of the first performance, Rossini wrote ""chi disprezza gl'infelici"" an aria around a single note (B flat); a difficult thing to do if the harmony is to remain stable and the piece is to have charm. But he did it.
The whole production comes off superbly; a good commentary on the quality of the composition itself fused with the artistry of the singers and the production team. Even after several viewings, I'm still thrilled by the singers and enthralled by the production.",1379116800,13,3198,4.774368231046932
8589114,4,B00D3O24NG,"I have no reservations about recommending this DVD for the singing, though I'm less enthusiastic about the production.

I'll start with what I liked.

The cast are uniformly excellent.

Ewa Podles is in a class of her own.  The voice is huge; the lower register cavernous; and the coloratura faultless.  I've had the opportunity of seeing her on stage in operas ranging from Handel to Wagner (No one else could possibly make Erda so interesting!).  She exceeded my expectations in her performance of the title role of this opera.

Jessica Pratt has matured as an artist since she was filmed in ""Le convenienze ed inconvenienze teatrali"" four years ago.  Her technique is impressive, with agile runs and a trill that any singer would envy.  I have always enjoyed Michael Spyres's combination of ringing tone and agility, perhaps even more than some other tenors in the same fach.  His voice has more weight, but all the fleetness, of the tenorino.  I'll repeat what I've said in other reviews and again state that I shall hope to hear more of him.  Mirco Palazzi, Robert McPherson and Carmen Romeu are very good in the smaller parts.

The score is tuneful, but it reflects the young age, 20, at which Rossini composed the work.  There are long stretches of recitativo secco, and I suspect that even they have been pared down.  Nor does the music serve the drama in the same way as the maestro's later works.  The story is loosely based on the Biblical tale of Belshazzar's Feast.  The scene in which Belshazzar (Baldassare) sees the writing on the wall falls remarkably flat.  It calls for a grand choral display and gets a mini-mad scene for Baldassare, with a comprimario Daniel thrown in to forecast death and destruction.  The most unusual piece is an aria on one note for the seconda donna.  Apparently that was the only note that Rossini considered the original singer could sing pleasantly.

The production by Davide Livermore has much in its favor, with one major flaw.  He chose to stage the work as a silent-film style Biblical Epic.  On the whole, this works very well, if he had only left off there.  He puts an audience on stage and revives the trite and tired play-within-a-play concept.  He might have thought this a fresh take on an old idea, but no one has been able to pull this off since Hamlet directed ""The Mouse-trap"" over 500 years ago.  If he had simply left the on-stage audience out of the picture, the performance would have been much more enjoyable.  Rather, the camera spends far too much time on them, especially during the first act.  There's an almost relentless focus on one woman supernumerary.  One too often sees her when the principals are singing away.  Perhaps the cameraman has a crush on her.  In any case, the presence of the on-stage audience is distracting, though not nearly as bad as the incessant, under-stage motion in the Pesaro DVD of ""Zelmira.""

This really is too bad, as otherwise the silent-film concept worked.  The black and white color scheme, down to the elaborate costumes and wigs, highlights the fact that we're seeing something from a bygone era, even if that era is longer ago than 1920.  Even the highly stylized gestures are appropriate to the highly stylized music.

Sound and picture are both very good.  The accompanying booklet has an interesting essay by Will Crutchfield, who conducts the performance.  There's a scene-by-scene synopsis, but, surprisingly, no track listing.

So, I recommend this to all lovers of Rossini.  I just wish the production had been less banal and distracting.",1378080000,24,3557,4.816528925619835
8589115,5,B00D3O24NG,"Dressing Rossini's Ciro in Babilonia up as a silent movie sounds like a bit of an arbitrary or frivolous choice, but there's no denying that Davide Livermore's production does at least inject some life into Rossini's otherwise stodgy Biblical drama. I was going to say ""inject some colour"" into the work, but since the colour scheme here is primarily black-and-white, that doesn't seem appropriate, particularly when all the colour the work needs is already there in the detail of Rossini's writing for the singers, and that hasn't been neglected here either. Singing and staging combined in this way, the impact achieved for this particular Rossini work - one that would unlikely ever be considered as one of the composer's greats - is simply tremendous. This is another coup for the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro.

Rossini's first religious drama for the Lenten festival in Ferrara in 1812 is, it has to be said, quite old-fashioned and probably not best suited for modernisation. By setting it Ciro a silent Cecil B. De Mille Biblical epic however, complete with projections, tramline scratches and even with fortepiano continuo, director Davide Livermore (responsible for the charming Pesaro production of Demetrio e Polibio) is also in a way looking back to a past and making a commentary about the nature of art and performance, and silent cinema with its old-style expressions and gestures perhaps has more in common with opera than you might think. It's very clever in that it allows the old-fashioned nature of the opera to actually ""work"" without resorting to irony. The stage concept can however only take this so far, and unless there are real merits in the work itself, it's not going to be enough to hold you for its full three hours. Fortunately, the Pesaro team also recognise how important the singing performances are in this particular work.

Evidently Rossini tailored his writing to suit specific singers, but more than just to show off their range, the composer clearly took advantage of their abilities to place it in the service of the drama. We can never know how such works sounded in their original performances, but on the very rare occasion when you have capable singers who understand the nature of bel canto, you get a glimpse of the true quality of a Rossini opera. The cast in this production are, quite frankly, just phenomenal. The role of Ciro, for example, requires the full richness of sound and the range of tessitura that only a true contralto can achieve, and you only realise that when you hear Ewa Podles sing the role. Her first scene in Act I, 'Ahi! Come il mio dolore, come calmar potr?' is just astonishing in its delivery, performance and technique, but it's the combination of that contralto voice with the other singers that gives the work real depth and range - and Rossini even provides an unaccompanied trio at the end of the prison scene in Act II to show this off.

Ciro is however by no means the only challenging role in the opera, and this production benefits from - and actually needs - exceptionally strong performers in the other roles. Jessica Pratt impressed in the Pesaro production of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adelaide-di-Borgogna/dp/B00ARWDRE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adelaide di Borgogna</a>&nbsp;(even if the work itself and the production were a little bit lacking), and she's even more impressive here as Amira. It's a spellbinding performance of extraordinary technical virtuosity, but more than that it's also fully in service of the drama and the nature of the production. Michael Spyres also plays up the silent movie villain role of Baldassare with a gorgeous deep lyrical tenor that navigates the demands of the role consistently and with wonderful expression. Robert McPherson's Arbace is more in the style of the light Italian tenor and just glides along here beautifully, perfectly complementing the other voices. Directing from the fortepiano, Will Crutchfield also leads an fine account of the work that shows Ciro in Babilonia to have qualities worth examining.

Released on Blu-ray by Opus Arte, the High Definiton presentation is impeccable. The image is clear, detailed and perfectly toned, and the whole performance is well filmed. The quality of the PCM and DTS 5.0 audio tracks also contributes to an appreciation of the performance and indeed the music itself. Other than a Cast Gallery there are no extra features on the disc. The enclosed booklet however gives information on the work and the production and also has a full synopsis of the opera. The BD is all-region, full-HD, BD50, with subtitles in English, French, German, Japanese and Korean.",1375660800,19,4694,5.140052356020942
