8320348,5,B001M213SI,"The Conciousness of the Christ is another breathtakingly beautiful film by Spiritual Cinema Film director Kell Kearns.  He also directed the spectacular ""Rumi Returning"" (filmed in Turkey). The C.of the Christ filmed in the Holy Lands,features five speaker presenters including Kell Kearns, Barbara Marx Hubbard, Andrew Harvey and the ever delightful and hilarious Marianne Williamson.  This is an enlightening experience presented in three parts.  Highly recommended.  Available at heavenearth.net",1245456000,3,498,6.173913043478261
