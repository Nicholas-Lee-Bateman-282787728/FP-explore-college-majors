The DVD clocks in at less than an hour and follows a presenter - who is cursed with a rather thick and nasal accent - as he travels about Pakistan. Now many such shows would try to present the nation being looked at in the best possible light however that doesn't seem to have been a concern here. This is both very brave and praiseworthy but also somewhat goes against the up beat nature of other Globe Trekker shows I've seen and certainly pours some cold water on the travel bug.

To illustrate, we get a segment where the chap goes and visits a hospital for leprosy. Shortly after he is talking to a female journalist who openly mentions that talking to a western man could get a woman stoned in some parts of the nation. Then we see how he needs armed guards to go to parts of the nation and another section where the issues of intestinal health are discussed. Snippets of interviews with people mention the harassment that can happen to western female travellers and that even in a large city like Lahore there are no-go zones for foreigners.

It all adds up to a fairly in your face appraisal of the sorts of issues that face the tourism industry in Pakistan. Sure makes me glad I'm never likely to be appointed Minister for Pakistani Tourism.

There are some plus points however, we get to see footage of a country so often maligned. The mountainous parts of the nation seem truly gorgeous and the views stunning. Those who love hard trekking would do well to try and see the later sections of this film.

Finally the DVD has some bonus features based around the music featured herein. And I should mention that the menu screen is easily operated.

An interesting addition to your travel library that's for sure, though videos by Zenith Irfan probably show more beautiful aspects of Pakistan in five minutes than this entire DVD manages.",1479427200,,2092,4.506596306068602
