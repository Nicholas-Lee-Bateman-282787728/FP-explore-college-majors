6126592,5,B00H1FDJVE,"This animated DVD movie lasts a little over 65 minutes and features two likable bear brothers, Briar and Bramble, and their archenemy Logger Vick in a two-part storyline. In part 1, the bear brothers team up with a few other forest animals in stopping Logger Vick from cutting down an old pine tree. In part 2, the more poignant part, the bears actually help Logger Vick get back to his parents' home for the Chinese New Year's reunion. The audio track is English only; voice acting is okay, sometimes a little over the top as is usual with these dubbed foreign cartoons, and quite noisy most of the time, but generally intelligible and professionally done. My kids really like this movie and even though they're still young, they get the message about getting home and getting together with one's family. You get a really funny car chase sequence, and a monkey king that reminds me of that lemur from Penguins of Madagascar, but less gay-ish. The DVD is not rated but there's a bit of cartoon violence and mildly foul language like ""you stinking bears!"" so I'd guess it's at the PG level. The animation is done in high-quality computer generated graphics.",1389398400,4,1156,4.727722772277228

8629103,1,B00H1FDJVE,"My kids liked it, but I couldn't stand the annoying high pitched whiney voices coming from the movie. It seemed like one person did all the voices. And the voices didn't match the characters mouths. I like quirky movies, but the plot didn't make sense, the animation was gross and the characters not worthy. My goal is to delete it, and never download a movie like this again.",1465344000,,376,4.544117647058823
