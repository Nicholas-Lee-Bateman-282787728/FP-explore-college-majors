8336539,2,B001QV83KQ,"I have not had a chance to watch the DVD as I was so dissappointed in the CD.  The first thing I did was to try and download it so I could listen to it while traveling.  I had purchased The Power of You CD but it hung in the car CD player and the Ford Dealership has not been able to retrieve it.  When I placed it in the laptop to download it ran for over an hour and finally kicked out.  When I went to the music and tried to play it there was nothing there.  I tried again and another hour later (which is not the usual download time of other CD's I've purchased) still no music.  I then put the CD in my CD player/radio and it played but would skip throughout various songs.  I love Collin Ray's songs on this album and try to listen to what I can of a few songs, but am very unhappy that I cannot download and/or listen to them all.

The shipping was great and it arrived on time as promised and that is why I gave this 2 stars....  but the CD is a big dissappointment!",1399939200,,974,3.878787878787879
8336540,5,B001QV83KQ,I enjoy this performance very much.  The only thing I would change is the audience sounds and I realize that they are part of a live performance.,1253577600,,145,4.37037037037037
