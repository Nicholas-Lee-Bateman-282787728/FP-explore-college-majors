7914127,5,B00000K3B4,"Dream Stalker is an unintentionally funny rip-off or mash up of Nightmare on Elm Street meets Friday the 13th meets throw them all in a shot-on-video vortex of hilarity, stupidity, and late '80's/90's strangeness.

Imagine a dirt bike guy dying and his fiancee trying to move on from his death, but the guy keeps haunting her via dreams.  Friends and those close to her are killed in strange ways.  Then suddenly the fiancee stays at a remote cabin, and adults, or teens, or  I can't tell what age these people who are camping nearby are supposed to be also end up in the dream killer's cross hairs.  This is basically a wild slasher movie peppered with oddness.

I loved this movie because it's gory, funny, poorly shot, and for old SOV fiends, this itches the scratch.  Death by Love wasn't my jam, but Dream Stalker is the star of the show.  For those worried about the bad audio, there are subtitles.  Problem solved.",1493596800,3,921,4.601226993865031
7914128,2,B00000K3B4,"'Dream Stalker' deals with the ultimate possessive boyfriend... one whose domineering ways isn't even stopped by death.
It is fairly good when  compared to other ultra-low budget horror flicks shot on video. The acting  is slightly better than average, the camera work is mostly okay, and what  effects and make-up it features aren't bad either. The pacing is mostly  pretty good, and, although the script could have done with another draft or  two to make the dialogue a little better, there aren't too many characters  behaving stupidly or illogically due to plot dictates. That said, the film  is marred by some of the worst sound work I've seen beyond home videos. In  several scenes, the dialogue is drowned out almost completely by background  noise, as if the crew was using microphones on their video cameras instead  of mikes on the actors or booms.
Even with that annoying techincal flaw,  'Dream Stalker' might have earned Three Stars if the last quarter of so of  the story hadn't started to fall apart when it should have been building to  its climax; it was almost as if the writer or director traded in story for  wild hacking and slashing.",967334400,6,1155,4.826530612244898
