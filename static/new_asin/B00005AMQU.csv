1416814,5,B00005AMQU,Having followed this show from day 1 I plan on buying the first movie in the least just to have the pilot handy. I'll probably watch the others as I tape it. There's more new stuff every few weeks.,988588800,,197,4.076923076923077
1416815,5,B00005AMQU,"Power Rangers Time Force is more than the newest version of this nearly ten year standard.  Once again, the show is trying to make its storyline more mature.  This time, the main characters are four young adults, young police officers from 1000 years in the future, to be precise.  These four, driven by a pact of honor and a need for justice, follow the 31st century's most vile criminal, a mutant named Ransck, back to the year 2001.  It is Ransk's belief that if he cannot rule the future, why not the past?
  The story's premise seems simple, but it does have one hell of a twist.  To those who haven't seen the original broadcasts, I'll keep quiet about it.  But, this little shocker can't help but make future episodes a little more intresting.
  Visually the show is stunning.  Its littered with special effects and the action during the battle scenes is nearly non-stop.  A little addition of human drama, with a touch of moral undertone, make this current version of Power Rangers one of the best to date.",984700800,5,1014,4.603351955307263
1416816,5,B00005AMQU,"After watching Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue, I thought it was the ultimate adventure, but now I can't wait for the release of Pwer Rangers Time Force The Movie.  I'm sure that as usual, this new adventure will be more thrilling and fascinating than their lost adventure. LET'S GO FOR IT!!!!!!!",983059200,6,296,4.92

379-380.  Force From The Future:  1000 years in the future, a mutant criminal, Ransik is captured and sentenced to prison.  But he manages to escape and he and his followers make their way to a time ship.  Ransik escapes to the past.  Jen and a team grab some equipment and follow him into the past.  This is quite possibly the greatest start to any Power Ranger season ever.  A+

381.  Something To Fight For:  Wes witnesses a bank robbery by some mutants and tries to help. The Rangers arrive and Jen tells him that he is not fighting.  Trip talks to Wes and tells him about Alex and the future.  Wes and Jen talk, and a mutant attacks the city.  Jen offers Wes another chance to prove himself by giving him Alex's morpher.  Another excellent episode, which happens to introduce one of the coolest Megazords ever.

Im going to buy Seasons 8-12 just so I can have all the episodes of this and the team-up with Wild Force.",1391644800,,1048,4.4603174603174605

7935619,5,B00005AMQU,"As hokey as they may be, the Power Rangers provide great fun and lots of inspiration for imaginative play for my 5-year-old. He and his friends have watched this movie countless times and act it out as it plays on, but even better, he makes up his own versions away from the vcr. I hear him learning the tough talk but using it in appropriate ways -- and with hokey humor, too. (e.g., before the garbage truck arrives, he turns and says, ""OK garbage can, your time is UP!"") When watched *with* the kids and when ""power-moves"" are monitored by parents, gearing them to a level of safety appropriate to age, these movies--and the world of Power Rangers -- can be a lot of fun and great food for kids' hungry imaginations!",1001548800,4,719,4.454545454545454
7935620,5,B00005AMQU,"This Power Rangers movie was one of the best movies that I have seen so far. It is an excellent with all the action and it's probably one of the best series I have seen since the Original series. It all begins in the year 3000. A mutant criminal named Ransik, escapes through a time warp to the year 2001. And so it is up to the Time Force police to catch them but they can't activate the morphers without a red ranger to lead them. The original red ranger died because Ransik struck him down without mercy. So now it is up to get a person who's D.N.A matches the original red ranger so they can activate the morphers and recapture Ransik and his group of mutant criminal and take them back to where they came from. But can they stop him when he's got some monsters and Cyclobots lurking around the corner? And how are they going to get back when the time ship's been destroyed? The answer's not revealed by you should brace yourself for an adventure that will blow you away!",1000166400,3,975,4.275675675675676
