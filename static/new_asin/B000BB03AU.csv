2409930,3,B000BB03AU,"I have the original G3 Live DVD as well and I haven to say I liked it better.  Why? Because the camera work on the Toyko show sucks, most of the music isn't that interesting and it's just too much noise at once during the jam.

However, I really did enjoy John Petrucci's two songs, he should have had more on here.  Glasgow Kiss and Damage Control were, to me, the most melodic and impressionalbe songs on the DVD.  Petrucci isn't much for show but he's got it down where it counts.

Vai is the biggest 'explorer' of the three in terms of where he takes guitar music.  He is very innovative in his approach but I find that his music on here is repetitive and I lost interest a little too easily.  But he is a showman and that almost makes up for it.

Satch is back at it but I still enjoyed his original G3 tracks more.  I dunno, these tracks just weren't that interesting to me for some reason.

I guess it was just nothing too new for me, except for Petrucci.  I'd buy a DVD of just him in concert. (not Dream Theater)  I've been to a G3 show with Malmsteen and I've seen Malmsteen by himself too.  I think it's time for a new approach to the 3G formula though because it's gettin kind of stale in my opinion.

If you don't have any of the G3 DVDs I'd go with the original.  I haven't seen the Denver show so I can't comment on that one.  They're all absolutely astonishing guitar players and musicians, no doubt about that.  But most of the music is just technical showcasing.  Lots of heart but no soul, ya know?",1130544000,3,1517,4.172413793103448
2409931,3,B000BB03AU,"Had originally blasted this for the lack of sound coming from satriani's guitar during the three man jam. Another review pointed out that it is panned hard left. I'm guessing that we had some bad cables that just cut out his guitar - everything else could be heard.

Pattrucci - excellent playing - clear and concise, my favorite for songs picked for the dvd. Unfortunatley he is as exiting to watch as a cardboard cutout.

Vai - wild with a wild band.

Satriani - my favorite for total watching experience - puts on a good show without going over the top.",1130284800,,556,4.485148514851486
2409932,4,B000BB03AU,"I have been a tremendous fan of the G3 concerts for years. In fact, you can see me in the front row of the ""Live in Denver"" DVD.  There are few people that are bigger fans of Joe, Steve, John, Yngwie, and Eric than me.  Many people share my sentiments when I say that the three song set formula they have been using, leaves this post-concert experience a little empty.

If you are fortunate enough to attend one of the concerts, it usually exceeds 3 hours and allows many more songs.  I've never understood why artists are unwilling to deliver what the fans (consumers) want (e.g. Metallica).  There is surely a market for a multi-disk compilation featuring the entire show. It would be worth the $100.00 expense.

In regards to the DVD and CD, there isn't much to say.  The performances are great, but some of the camera work leaves something to be desired.  It is shot in a widescreen format, which I absolutely love, but it lacks the intimacy of the Denver show.  The cameras seem very far away for the most part and they have to put the zoom on maximum to get close shots.  There are also a couple of shots where they fail to adjust the viewing ratio and all three individuals are compressed, tall and skinny.

The fabulous artists in Steve Vai's band are barely evident as well.  I would have been much happier to see some great shots of Dave Weiner and Tony McAlpine, but they were simply pushed to the side.

The Audio is superb. With the exception of some amplifier issues during Joe's solo at the end (he explains it in the commentary section), the 5.1 audio is flawless and a very good mix.  The Joe Satriani technical difficulty is much more prominent on the CD version because their digital editor was able to smooth it out somewhat on the DVD. Joe doesn't believe in overdubs so he left it in to stay ""honest"" to the show.

Unlike the ""Rockin' In the Free World"" release, the DVD and CD are identical.  Same location and set-list. Seems barely justifiable to purchase both.  Hardcore fans like me won't have difficulty justifying the expense.  Something to be mindful about, however, is the new copy protection software installed on the CD version.  This will restrict your ability to play it on your computer without installing proprietary software and nearly impossible to play and rip in iTunes if you have a Mac.  If you have the means, I would suggest recording the audio from the DVD to make yourself an audio only copy for in car use.

Ultimately, this concert allows for fans to see and hear songs, to date, they have not heard live. Most classics are absent, with the exception of ""The Audience is Listening"", and most songs are prominent standouts from the artist's latest releases.  I can't really put my finger on it, but somehow I just feel a little short changed. Was it the (cold) venue? The camera work? I'm not really sure, but the experience lacks some luster.",1130284800,13,2891,4.562015503875969

2409938,5,B000BB03AU,"If you don't like total guitar virtuosity, don't bother! John Petrucci, Steve Vai, Joe Satriani backed by bands that are as kick a** as they are! The DVD's sound is great, as is the camera work. You really have to see John Pertrucci's fingerwork to believe it! Steve Vai plays with his customary flair, and Satriani...well, I saw him at the Silver Legacy in Reno, and Leslie West of Mountain, who warmed up for him called him a ""(expletive) showoff""! Petrucci's set included Dave LaRue of the Dixie Dregs on a cool Music Man bass. If you have the proper home theater system, at the end of the show, with you ears ringing, you'll think to yourself ""There's no way these guys are human""!",1381449600,,685,4.532258064516129

2409940,4,B000BB03AU,"I would have given the show 5 stars, but the thing that pissed me off was when the 3 were doing improvisations to classic rocks songs, Vai would cut off Petrucci's ending to his solos when the 3 were going back and forth. For example, listen to when they cover ZZ Top's ""La Grange,"" particularly when they go back and forth. Listen to Petrucci's solos, and you'll notice Vai cutting off Petrucci a lot. For God's sake, Petrucci wasn't finished! Let him finish!!

Anyway, that pissed me off a lot and I had to talk about it, lol.",1365206400,,528,4.387755102040816

Farhad",1354492800,,148,4.481481481481482
2409943,5,B000BB03AU,"After watching this performance on YouTube, I just HAD to see it again! There is nothing like watching a live performance and this production comes close to that stage front and center experience! I know we're all listening to our music on 'ear buds' these days, but put this into your entertainment center and turn the knob! This collaboration just blows the doors off ...!!!

Notably, Satriani has the widest appeal. His melodic and imaginative sounds mixed with good rhythms appeals to the masses. His finger work is recognizable and simply memorizing. He remains right on point in this performance and although his signature sound is identifiable, the collection is unique and does not disappoint ...I rate this as some of his best work to date. In the G3 group performances, as in others, he provides just the right amount of leadership to bring these 'Master's' together in an entirely enjoyable evening of sound and 'guitar magic'. This work is fantastic and just brings the emotions straight out of your chest until it is beating on fire right in front of your face ...and then your soul starts to scream and dancing.

Vai's experimental nature does not always capture the general imagination as does Satriani's sound. Some 'folks' just don't get it. (I don't always). But here, more than any of his other performances that I've seen, Vai's style will click with the majority of listeners. And, as always, Vai has a certain 'performance/exhibitionist' style which is pure 'Rock-n-Roll'. Vai certainly puts on a good show. What most impressed me (and was culturally well received and understood in Tokyo, Japan) was his presentation of respect for his 'teacher', with a long, deep and humble bow of respect and appreciation to Joseph Satriani. ""Well Done, Vai!""

Petrucci was previously too extreme in his sounds for my liking. But, of all the surprises ...!!! I couldn't believe what I was hearing and seeing. I was absolutely beautiful, rich and deep! His invention, Glassglow Kiss, is superb and his finger work is nothing less than spectacular to watch. He appears a little the outsider, but with no less the respect. Wow! I almost ...almost change my favorite guitar players! It was that good! Again, this is a new sound for Petrucci, definitely appealing to a wider audience but with all the speed and more the delight than his previous work.",1354233600,,2355,4.926952141057934
2409944,4,B000BB03AU,"I bought this because some other reviewers said it was the best of the G3 performances.  I'm much more familiar with Joe Satriani than Steve Vai and John Petrucci.  After watching this, nothing has changed for me.  Satriani has the most approachable sound.  I like some Vai stuff in moderation.  I appreciate Petrucci, but probably a little less than the other guys.

I think that Steve Vai was the most entertaining on stage, but it is ultimately about the music, right?  Watching them all jam to the classics was really great.  Smoke on the Water from Deep Purple's live album is one of my all-time favorites and the version on this G3 stands up to the original very well.",1343520000,,674,4.605042016806722

2409946,2,B000BB03AU,"The video it self is great. If you like classic rock or guitar stuff, you must own the G3 videos. The G3 live with Eric Johnson is my personal favorite. But this copy, the video at the end is messed up. The color runs all together the last few minutes. Kind of like something out of the 60's.",1244246400,,292,4.051724137931035
2409947,4,B000BB03AU,"with all due respect to the monumental talent on this DVD, the John Petrucci trio stood out from the rest. Only two songs in the set, but what beautiful numbers, flawlessly performed, all three musicians tight and precise. The opening number, Glasgow Kiss, has a celtic feel and Petrucci shines with a focused intensity from the first lyrical riff  to the high-powered finish.  Drummer Mike Portnoy plays perfectly off Petrucci--at the finale, he leaps out of his chair as a release from the intensity of his concentration. A magical musical moment! The second number, Damage Control, starts out with a toneless power-chord riff that repeats a little too long before  unfolding into a beautiful instrumental epic. Lots of wonderful twists and turns with an exotic, middle-eastern groove woven in. I have to say this set from the Tokyo tour is my favorite out of all three of the G3 DVD releases.  As for Vai's and Satriani's sets, those guys are incredible guitarists and I love their playing. But some of Satch's compositions seem redundant and Vai's drummer doesn't appear to get a chance to explore rhythmically or dynamically on Vai's numbers. Even so, this DVD is a great one to own and listen to repeatedly. Don't forget to check out Petrucci's nod to Richie Blackmore""s solo from the great Deep Purple Made in Japan album during the G3 jam. It's all good!",1227398400,,1362,4.857758620689655
2409948,4,B000BB03AU,"I love all the G3, Joe Satriani and Steve Vai together is like having the two best guitar legends combined into one, I have never heard of John Petrucci before, so it was great to hear another great guitarist, and the three togther its an awesome mix

2409950,5,B000BB03AU,"It's all good, all 3 memebers of G3 do it justice.
John Petrucci's solo work was amazing.
Steve and Joe of course give you thier high standards of excellence as expected.
 Let it rip.",1206403200,,183,4.382352941176471
2409951,4,B000BB03AU,"The G3 legend continues with the legendary Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and John Petrucci offering individual performances, followed by all three taking the stage together in Tokyo. All three guitarists are top-notch in their performances and the sound quality on the DVD is excellent.
The climax at the end of this is a riff-and-shred-trading session between the three during ""Foxey Lady"", ""La Grange"" and ""Smoke On The Water"".

Quite frankly, I was disappointed that John Petrucci's session only included two songs and Satriani and Vai three. I think that one or two more for Petrucci, followed by another each for Satriani and Vai would have been beneficial towards making this a five-star rating. Indeed, the musical virtuosity on this comes in at five stars but the brevity of it knocks off a half-star to land at 4.5.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this as an opportunity to see all three guitarists join together in a rare performance.",1196553600,,945,5.012738853503185
2409952,5,B000BB03AU,"If you're a Petrucci fan, which I am you can't do without this DVD. AS well as lots of Satriani and Vai footage, the G3 videos essentially showcase the talents of 3 exceptionally amazing guitarists, and with me being a long time Dream Theater fan I couldn't miss this one. John goes through a couple of tracks from his solo project which on all accounts does not fail to impress one bit.
Do the needful. Buy this DVD.",1193184000,,417,4.358974358974359
2409953,5,B000BB03AU,"Petrucci and Johnson are my favorite to round out the triads in Steve and Joe's shredfests. Petrucci is a class act and an ensemble player who is not a limelight hog or a show-off. All of the solo acts are great, and the jam session is a classic! The camerawork on the DVD is good -- aspiring guitar gods be able to ""see"" stuff close up they wouldn't get on a CD or at a live show.",1188172800,,381,3.961038961038961
2409954,4,B000BB03AU,"I bought this a week after seeing the 2007 live G3 show in Boston. I had been disapointed with the show in Boston because of poor acoustics and sound mixing at the Orpheum. However, this DVD from thier Tokyo show is great and cost wayyyyy less than seeing them live. The sound quality is fantastic; the mix is perfect and the camera work is VERY good. In JP's set the camera at one point lines up perfectly to see JP and Dave Larou wailing over frets with synchronised speed and the effect is pretty exciting for a player who is watching. The Vai set is typical stuff and for me is OK but Satch's set is VERY good, maybe better than his set on the Satch, Vai, Johnson DVD. I had paid no attention to Petrucci till seeign the live show and this DVD has earned him my respect as a truly talented and professional player. His set alone is worth the price of this DVD. I also have the G3 DVD with Satch, Vai and Eric Johnson. That one is IMHO the best of the G3 concerts available on DVD. The Tokyo show is the second best. I saw the one with Malmstein and was very disapointed with Malmstein. One last note... of the 3 DVDs I mention here, the Satch, Vai, Johnson DVD has the best G3 jam at the end. The chemistry of those 3 in the jam's classic blues forum just worked better. Even Vai who is anything but a traditional blues player kicked out some of the coolest blues/rock licks I've ever heard; my favorite having a lot of Jimmy Page flavor to it.",1179014400,,1448,4.193548387096774
2409955,5,B000BB03AU,"Joe always brings the big show for the G3. These guys have such great sound.

2409956,5,B000BB03AU,"This is the greatest rock guitar album ever! Satriani and Vai produce their usual high quality stuff, but the revelation is Petrucci, as he brings together all those years of experience with Dream Theater et al to produce two 10 minute tracks of sheer virtuosity: an amalgamation of skill, passion, power, and control. The conclusion of the three in concert together is a real joy as they take three old favourites (Hendrix, ZZ Top, and Deep Purple) and dance new rythms around old standards with delightful skill. Buy this album!",1169596800,,530,4.9
2409957,5,B000BB03AU,Im not big on words so I'll make this short. This was one of the most incredible G3 concerts I have ever seen. Most of the songs are ones I like and John Petruccis guitar playing is phenomenal. I used to think Steve Vai was the best guitar player in the world. Mr. John Petrucci has me thinking twice about that. He only plays 2 songs on the DVD but they are very long and played flawlessly as far as I can see. I have watched this DVD at least 3x now and will probably do so many more times in the future. This one is a no brainer. Buy it.,1167955200,,540,3.873873873873874
2409958,4,B000BB03AU,"Excellent footage, sound quality, and camerawork from Japan.  Petrucci holds his own while opening the show with 2 songs.  Vai comes out for 3 tunes like a man possesed and Satriani melts your mind with his 3.  When they all get together for a 3 song jam they take turns with some breathtaking solos that really take songs like Smoke on the Water and La Grange to new levels.  This DVD is worth adding to your collection.",1164240000,,421,4.428571428571429

2409960,5,B000BB03AU,"This is another impressive concert from Satch and friends. My favorite part (Sorry Joe!) was the John Petrucci set. He plays only two songs from his Suspended Animation disc and Mike Portnoy and Dave LaRue are Rock Solid throughout. Searching is my favorite part of Joe's set and Vai is never disappointing. The Jam tunes were a little more cohesive than the Denver show. As much as I love Yngwie, I believe the jams were a bit more competitive then. Definitely less toes being stepped on with Petrucci. He was in awe of Satch and Vai while Yngwie didn't give two poops about them earlier in his career and has said as much in interviews back in the day.",1159228800,,654,4.504201680672269

El DVD no trae extras y el sonido es estereo digital , pero la buena energia que maneja el grupo en escena hace que estos pequeos detalles se pasen por alto.

interpretan temas de sus tres trabajos en estudio mas que todo del EAT ME IN ST LOUIS Y DEL BIG LAD IN THE WINDMILL , para mi los dos mejores trabajos del grupo.

Recomendado para aquellos que deseen ver una banda con mucha musica y tecnica.",1155254400,,838,4.284810126582278
2409962,5,B000BB03AU,"I'm just going to add to what others have already said.

First, some people are complaining that Petrucci only played two songs in his solo set, whereas the others played three.  Well maybe if these guys could count past three, they'd realize that Petrucci's set was around 18 minutes long, Vai's was around 20, and Satch's was around 21.  Besides, if you want to see more of John, you could always buy a Dream Theater DVD.

As far as Joe's choice of songs on the disc, it should be obvious... he included ""Up in Flames"" and ""Searching"" because they were two of the best songs on the album, ""Is There Love in Space"" (which was his most recent album at the time).  He also included ""War"", an older song that was not as big of a hit as some others.  I'm sure he played quite a few other songs, as there's no way he'd travel all the way to Japan to play for 20 minutes.  My guess is that those songs had to be cut out of the DVD in order to stuff the whole concert onto a single DVD.  Besides, they were probably already featured on the ""Live in SF"" DVD or the other two G3 DVDs.

Conclusion: if you appreciate the electric guitar, buy this DVD.  Don't tell me you can't afford it.  It costs less than a single movie ticket.",1148688000,2,1221,4.197424892703863

2409965,5,B000BB03AU,"This dvd is very good, but I think they should have included at least one more Petrucci Song, he stole the show as Vai and Satriani do not offer anything new. Also Petrucci has Mike POrtnoy as drummer.

An excellent purchase for such a low price.",1142899200,,302,4.375

I am getting to see that too many ego's spoil the broth here.

Also frustrated lead guitar players doing bass guitar solo's have never worked for me,(either play lead guitar or bass, or shut up), so stay at home Mr Sheen, and hand it over to a real bass player. (ie; Wooten)

It's a great pity they never released the Japan G3 tour with Andy Timmons this would really be worth watching. (and he can out play all of them, and tastefully)

2409971,4,B000BB03AU,"It Bites wasn't proggy enough or pop enough or pretty enough or even around long enough to hit it big, but damned if this was not a group with chops -- and juice. The juice is what's on full display in this recording of a Tokyo show that just happened to fall out of somebody's closet one day. And here it is, readily available for our consumption, 16 years or so after the fact.

Led by Frank Dunnery's Gabriel-esque voice and Holdsworthian fretboard wizardry and the writing talents of the band -- most notably John Beck on keyboards -- It Bites left behind a small but astonishingly durable body of work. Their best and longest song ""Around the World in a Day"" is conspicuously missing, but the second best, ""Old Man and the Angel,"" is not, and that alone is worth the price of admission. ""Yellow Christian"" is also a standout, and the inevitable ""Calling All The Heroes"" and ""Still Too Young To Remember"" are also featured.

Check out the size of Dunnery's hands and his ease in singing over complicated guitar parts! Kind of makes one wonder why he dropped this gig so completely and took up life as a troubador and astrology expert (or some such nonsense).

John Beck's keyboard work is hard to appreciate because it's kind of lost in the mix. Unfortunately his vocals are not; I wonder if the technology is not around to sweeten those up a bit because they really take away from what is otherwise a stellar set.

I would have given this one five stars if it had included the entire set.",1137628800,2,1493,4.498154981549815
2409972,4,B000BB03AU,"The tradition of G3 concerts is taken to a new level incorporating John Petrucci. It is sad that only two songs from him were included in this DVD. Satriani and Vai, as always, deliver their creativity, impecable technique, and control of the instrument and effects. The jam session is interesting ... it seems that Satriani and Vai were not in complete synchrony with Petrucci. But, any way, three virtuosos together always have something interesting to offer. It is becoming a tradition of this kind of DVD's to stuff them with irrelevant and poor additional features.",1137456000,,570,5.010526315789473
2409973,5,B000BB03AU,"Thats right...can you believe it?Marty Friedman apprently jammed with the 3some on stage that night,and its not on the DVD.I thought these 3 would be beyond things like royalty distribution etc and would put out the best dvd they can,for the love of the craft. You cant have Marty play with you and not put that on tape...or dvd. That apart...the dvd is awesome. Production values are top notch. Like somebody else said,I wish Steve Vai had chosen better songs.....I am not too crazy about Satch's "" up in flames"" either....Petrucci is flawless. A great buy by all means",1137283200,,570,4.767676767676767
2409974,4,B000BB03AU,"my favorite G3 effort. excellent camera work and sound. as usual, joe and steve were great. steve has the same line-up as the london dvd with a different drummer. that said, i thought john petrucci stole the show. he's got mike portnoy and dave larue with him (heavy duty firepower if i do say so)and works 'em. the songs are really well written and the performance is awesome. the reason i only gave it 4 stars is i really feel they could put more effort, organization wise, into the group thing at the end when they step all over each other. it's not appealing to those of us who know better. BUT, if you like instrumental rock guitar, you need to buy this now.",1136764800,,663,4.354838709677419
2409975,5,B000BB03AU,"This whole DVD just ""ROCKS"" ... coz the best 3 have performed. I am not biased & truely no offense YJM & E.Johnson .... G3 is just Satriani, Vai & Petrucci.

This DVD is a must for any G3 fan !!!!",1136419200,,196,3.7804878048780486
2409976,3,B000BB03AU,"I'll start by saying this DVD comes at a great price. That being said, it's pretty forgettable. While all three musicians showcased here do their best and do amaze, I find myself wanting to hear more Petrucci, a whole lot less Vai and maybe asking Satch how he decided to pick those three songs. Vai annoys me with his onstage antics and his truly pompous attitude. Plus, with the exception of Audience is Listening, his set sucked. Satch picked two bad songs out of three. I have nothing bad to say about Petrucci. I do have something bad to say about the last three songs where they're together. Petrucci just disappears soundwise at that point and makes it sound pretty lame. Anyway, overall I didn't enjoy this DVD, but it was still worth having to see such amazing musicians at play.",1136246400,,788,4.595744680851064
2409977,5,B000BB03AU,"Most of us are probably familiar enough with Satriani and Vai already, so I'll put some more spotlight on JP. John Petrucci (of Dream Theater) is an incredible addition to the G3 lineup this time around.

When I first saw this DVD I was disappointed that John Petrucci only had two songs on the setlist. But his two songs ""Glasgow Kiss"" and ""Damage Control"" are as intricate and as powerful as they are long; so it really isn't a problem as you get to see Petrucci's uncanny ability to keep the same song fresh and exciting even eight minutes into it. Satriani and Vai tend to get a little repetative after a couple minutes, but Petrucci knows how to hold your interest. And unlike Yngwie (in the G3 Live in Denver video) JP is much more in tune with the crowd as well as with Satch & Vai; so there is chemistry all over the place.

The Jam songs at the end of the video hold up to what you should expect from a G3 show. They trade licks, play three part harmonies, and occassionally just run everything together (which sounds a bit odd) as each G3 show has done before in the past. They all do a great job and really made what I paid for the DVD worth it.

If you aren't sure which G3 video to purchase, I would recommend this one. I have seen them all, and think this one is marginally the best despite it only being 108 minutes.",1133654400,6,1331,4.232283464566929
2409978,4,B000BB03AU,"G3 returns in fine form with ""G3 Live in Tokyo"". The same formula as the last two g3 DVDs is repeated.  Joe Satriani  teams up with Steve Vai and find a third guitarist worthy of sharing the stage with them. Each member performs his own set and then all 3 jam on stage together. It worked on the  previous 2 DVDs and it works again. This time, with the addition of John Petrucci of Dream Theater/LTE, is the best time. Yes, there is only 90 minutes worth of music, but if you want the full G3 experience go see them. The 90 minutes is a great deal for under $15. Now to the show:

John Petrucci plays a couple of songs from his ""Suspended Animation"" disc. I saw G3 with Petrucci back in 2001 and thought that he should release the music he was playing. Now he has. Both songs showcase Petrucci's ability to combine speed, tone and phrasing in an instrumental form. Both songs have a couple of tone and time changes, and Petrucci shows why he is considered one of the best guitarists in the rock genre. (Or any genre for that matter) Fans of Dream Theater or any of John's other projects won't be dissapointed. John is joined by, DT drummer, Mike Portnoy and Dave Larue of Steve Morse and Dreg's fame. The rhythm section is solid and all over John's music. A very good set.

Steve Vai is next and continues to be the most energetic of the G3 members. Vai opens with ""The Audience is Listening"" from Passion & Warfare and it is a blistering version. Steve and bassist Billy Sheehan go wild during this song. They trade fours, exchange picking hands, and play some high speed unison lines. These two have been mesmerizing together since the David Lee Roth Band, and have taken their showmanship to new levels. ""Building the Church"" and ""K'm-Pee-Du-Wee"" are the other Vai tunes and Steve is his amazing self. Vai has been guilty of composing tunes that I can't identify with, but these are both great compositions and Steve's playing is true virtuosity at its best. Great set from a great showman.

Joe Satriani's set is also very good. He plays great versions of ""Up In Flames"" and 'Searching' but is guilty of not stretching out as far as he can. Still, both of these songs are excellent and show Satch's unparalled ability to combine catchy melodies with guitar virtuosity. 'War' is a song that Satch stretches out on and improvises a unique ending. Excellent version.

As always, the DVD ends with all 3 guitarists on stage. ""Foxey Lady"" is the first tune. Mike Portnoy plays drums on this tune.  How can you go wrong with these 3 guys jamming to Jimi? The last two songs have Jeff Campitelli on Drums and Billy Sheehan joins Matt Bisonette on bass. The two bassists alternate taking the vocal duties and do a decent job. Both songs feature each guitarist taking a solo spot and then all 3 trading 4s at the end. More G3 madness done right. As always, if you aren't a fan of guitar, you won't be a fan of this. If you are a fan of any of these three, then you should get this. I am a fan of all 3, and find it to be the best of the 3.",1132531200,59,3034,4.367021276595745
2409979,4,B000BB03AU,"John Petrucci is a very smooth player, and when he's speed-picking, his right hand moves so quickly you can barely tell it's moving at all.  Steve Vai delivers the goods, as always, and his band is hot.  Jeremy Colson's enthusiastic drumming is particularly admirable.  Joe Satriani's performance of ""War"" is most significant; relevant to the times, Joe finishes with a bit of melody that is, shall we say, ""extremely Eastern.""  I took this as a fairly bold statement.

The jam at the end is, like the previous G3 jams, another guitar-mad frenzy.  The trading-off becomes a bit tedious.  Satch's guitar is panned hard-left, and he could be louder.  Joe's vocals are terrible on Hendrix's ""Foxy Lady,"" but Billy Sheehan does a good job with ZZTop's ""La Grange,"" and Matt Bissonette does OK with the Deep Purple classic, ""Smoke On The Water.""  What's most interesting here, besides the welcome addition of Mike Portnoy on drums for the first song, is that Bissonette and Sheehan are on stage together.  Personally, I think the idea of two bass players is a great one.  It only adds to the ""guitarishness"" of it all.  Ok, I know I just made up that word.  Forgive me.  But I believe this is the first time we've seen two bass players in a G3 jam.

All in all, this is a great concert and the price is right.  Though it may be a bit of a guitar overdose, it's just what some of us need to escape from the fashion show that is the pop scene these days.",1131753600,6,1447,4.507692307692308
2409980,5,B000BB03AU,"Petrucci - a big surprise.  He seems to be very precise, highly technical and very much melodic.

Vai - my favorite in this DVD.  at his best.  ""Building the church"" is very powerfull, yet based on many oriental motives, using 1/4 tones etc.  his following track is a masterpeace. keeps you very much entratained, with unexpected tune development.  some blocks use  jazzy formats and jazzy positions.

Satriani - I was a bit dissapointed by his 3 tracks which were not interesting enough.  I felt like he starts to repeat itself.

3G jam - excellent selection. In this part Satriani came back to life , with closest as possible to the othentic original , basic sound and style from Hendrix and Blackmore.  Petrucci sounded a bit shy and too technical leaving his soul behind.  He needs another one or two 3G concerts to become part of the team.

Sound and video - excellent quality. no complaints.
Bottom line - just go buy it , don't waste your time reading these reviews...........",1130976000,8,983,4.711764705882353
2409981,5,B000BB03AU,"Don't listen to the other reviews about this DVD. Let me tell you why...

First, people are complaining about the length of the DVD and how it only has 3 songs per set. Okay, 3 guitarists x 3 songs + another 3 for the Jam. Thats 15 songs, to be fair its 14 because Petrucci does 2. So 14 songs. And the DVD is $12 dollars!! Come on people, thats cheap for a Live DVD with 14 songs.

Second, the camera angles and quality is great. Being a guitar player, I know that its important to focus a lot on the guitarists, which they do in this DVD.

Third, people are saying that the sets are boring. The sets are GREAT because they play different songs than what is normal! Do you really want 3 dvds with the same songs on each one? I didn't think so.

So in closing, this DVD is an excellent addition to anyones collection. The sound is great, the songs are a fresh addition to the live set, and the video is great too. Quit complaining people.",1130803200,9,938,4.137362637362638
2409982,5,B000BB03AU,I don't know guys. I just read the reviews posted and I'd have to say that I seriously disagree! This DVD is excellent! John Petrucci I do agree is probably the best of the 3 performances and it doesn't hurt having his DT buddy Mike Portnoy playing drums either! Dave LaRue plays some excellent driving bass! I saw G3 do this show a few years ago and I thought it was the best one so far! I saw G3 in it's previous incarnations as well as the last one with Y. Malmasteen. Enjoyed each one. I didn't get bored. I got energized! Lots and lots of raw energy in these shows. I also found the tour with Robert Fripp quite amazing. As far as the DVDs go I think the first release was not quite as strong as the Denver show and the Tokyo show. The Denver show really rocks too! But I think Steve Vai's performance on the Tokyo show was a bit more driving and strong than on the Denver DVD (and even alot of his stuff on the Live at the Astoria DVD). They come on strong on this one. Billy Sheehan is playing his butt off as well as Dave Weiner and Tony MacAlpine! And that drummer is simply amazing and playing so damned hard! To me it is simply amazing to watch. Satch's performance is top notch as well on his set. I also loved the first song he did on the Live at Denver DVD. Just amazing! I don't think any of this is stale (as a previous reviewer said). Far from it! I think it is a rare treat to have shows like this that bring all these artists together and I am thankful that Joe continues on with the G3 tradition.,1130803200,28,1516,4.073578595317726

8084204,3,B000BB03AU,"This turned out to be a little disappointing in my opinion.  I am a fan of all three leaning towards Joe Satriani as the favored of the three.  First there are solo performances done by each of the guitarists ( Petrucci followed by Via then by Satriani bring up the tail end.  After the two to three solo performances from each artist they combine forces to play three additional tracks.

As for the solo performances Petrucci far out did the others.  It is about the only part of the DVD I play repeatedly.  As for the ""combined forces"" efforts they covered Foxy Lady by Hendrix,  Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple and La Grange by ZZ Top.  Really?  Three of the most talented guitarists and that's what they chose?  If you are going to do Deep Purple you can stay on the same album ( Machine Head) and at least play Highway Star.

Aside form the somewhat less than over the top performances,  the video resolution and audio quality were greatly lacking.  Even given the fact this was not recorded last year with the lasted in high res cameras and digital mastering,  it fell short.  I have Pink Floyd Pulse DVD that is as old or older and has much greater audio quality.",1435536000,,1172,4.411214953271028
