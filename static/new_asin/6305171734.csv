973982,5,6305171734,"""God does not exist, if Aushwitz exists,"" says Primo on the train. Truce shows something else . . . how a man's soul cannot be destroyed. Truce is a travelogue through the chaos of post war Europe. Beginning in Aushwitz, Primo and has band of brothers traverse the wilds of Poland, Russia, and, finally, Munich en route to their home. Their souls are slowly reborn. They find love, compassion and a simple appreciation of nature before landfall in Italy. By chance, by laugh, they complete their journey from death to life. The only negative(a small one) in this movie was the use of voice over narration by Primo. The visuals tell the story; the voice over narration was unwarranted. I would have liked to have seen more of Primo Levi beginning his life in Turin, but this would have been a different odyssey.",1137196800,8,810,4.671328671328672
973983,2,6305171734,"Having read most of the reviews in relation to ""The Truce"" - I think I am going to find myself in a minority of one.

I bought this DVD because I thought that the storyline was interesting and because of the good reviews.

However,having now watched it twice I found that most of the acting and the scenarios defided credibility.

Right from the start when we saw the alledged inmates of Auschwitz virtually running to the open gates - a situation which,to anyone who has seen original footage of the liberation by the Russians,would know that,most of the unfortunate inmates could hardly stand let alone run. This immediately struck an un-realistic chord. Shortly afterwards we are introduced to a large Greek gentleman(with the boots)- a totally unbelievable character,with an OTT performance by the actor concerned,played more as a caricature rather than an actual character - and there were numerous others who were just not convincing. In fact the main character (Primo) was the one performance which was excellent and believable,who did convey the fact that he had just come from Auschwitz,most of the others gave the impression that they had just come from a holiday camp.

Also there were too many musical pieces in the film,which gave me the impression that the director wasn't sure whether to go for serious drama or a semi- musical.(At times I almost expected Topol to come in singing ""If I was a rich man"" or similar!)The scene with the swords-man dancing to ""Cheek to Cheek"" was one such case and rather pointless.

The plus-points of the film were the superb photography,the fact that,as some other reviewer mentioned,sub-titles were not used when many of the different nationalities were encountered ""en-route"",which did convey the difficulties in making one-self understood,plus,as already mentioned,the excellent performance by the main character Primo.

The thing is though,with any film,unless you are regarding it as pure escapism - you need to believe what you are watching,and this was not the case with this film. As already mentioned,there were too many un-believable characters and too many un-likely scenarios which was a great shame as the basic story could have been made into a good film,but it needed to be under-played NOT over-played.

If you are the sort of person who can just accept that whatever you are seeing portrayed is true and life-like, you may enjoy this(plus any John Wayne war films!)- but to me it was totally un-convincing.

I am aware it was based on a true story and,if all the incidents in the film did truly happen,I am convinced that they didn't happen quite as portrayed in the film.

""The Pianist"" is so much better,my advise,buy that instead.",1120953600,18,2698,5.017897091722595
973984,5,6305171734,"THE best film I've seen in years .
Primo ( John Turturro in his best role )is a survivor of Auschwitz , survivor of Holocaust . He is Italian Jew saved by Russians at the end of WWII . All he wants is so simple - just to go home . But railroads are destroyed and he has to make a detour true Minsk ( Minsk is a capital of Belorussia . Minsk is a hometown of my mother . Minsk is the city where only 4 buildings was still standing after WWII . Minsk is the city which my mother had to leave when she was 2 years old and hide under the horse cart during the air strikes ... she still can't talk about it .)At the same time he need to learn how to live usual life , how to look without scare , without pain . How to live at all .
 What makes this film 10 stars out of 5 ... little details , the feeling , the scare in everyone's eyes . I know this feeling . I know this scare . I don't want to remember it , but this film brought it back . And especially now I think everyone have to learn it ... before it is too late .
This film is very slow and very deep . Acting on highest level - I even forgot that this is actors ""acting"". What shocked me most - the details , just little things which are so important ,
 This film have to be watched by everyone and taken deep into our hearts . This kind of story might and have to change our world for better .

973985,5,6305171734,"If posible, I would award ten stars to the film version of Primo Levi's ""La Tregua"".  This is a superb movie about what happened to the prisoners of Auschwitz after their liberation by the Red Army.  The role of Primo, an Italian Jew, is played brilliantly by John Turturro.  Along with survivors of various nationalities, the band of liberated Italians is taken to a transition camp run by Soviet medical personnel.  Here the survivors recover from their ordeal, rebuilding their strength for the long journey home.  A chemist by profession, Primo joins the Soviet medical staff until the train finally arrives to transport everyone home.  Unfortunately, the railroad track has been everywhere destroyed by war, necessitating a prolonged and circuituous route through Minsk.  During the trip, the Holocaust survivors are dependent on the limited supplies of the Red Army and the generosity of impoverished Soviet citizens.
The Italian language is ""dubbed"" in accented English for this American film, and a variety of foreign languages -- Russian, Polish, Ukranian, German, French -- are spoken without subtitles.  This very realistically conveys the confusion and frustration experienced by the survivors.  The audience, like Primo, must rely on translators or simply decipher some dialogue from context or pantomime.  By utilizing panoramic filming of scenery, changing gradually from dreary winter to spring to early summer, the movie gives a strong sense of the interminable duration of the journey home. Recurrent throughout the film are eerie black-and-white flashbacks to the horror of Auschwitz.  Some of these are wrenching. Overall,though, the theme is of hope, and of camaraderie and kindness helping to heal the wounds of the Holocaust.  Watching ""Truce"" is an emotional experience,  depicting true events that must never be forgotten.",981244800,54,1847,5.43859649122807
973986,5,6305171734,"I rarely write reviews. This film compels in more ways than words can express. It has it all: soul, humor, a teaching conscience, which is rare in film today. It is well-made and well-directed, and the acting is superb  and convincing. I saw it several times in the theater and anticipate owning  my own copy. This is the kind of film that should be required viewing in  today's college history classes when World War II is covered--learning  ""what happened next"" is as important as the events themselves, so  that we can see the results of our actions, or our inactions.",930700800,31,571,4.67

7884072,5,6305171734,"While hard to find, I love this movie.  Unlike most Holocaust stories, this one focuses on what happened after the camps were freed.  The inspiration for this movie is Primo Levi's account of what happened after ""Survival in Auschwitz"".  Although the movie never forgets about what happened in the camps -- indeed, Levi clearly states that his role and all of the survivors should be to bear witness-- the tone of the movie is more picaresque, as the survivors bounce from one camp to another in Russia and Poland.  By turns romantic, humorous, serious, and lighthearted this is fun to watch, and John Turturro does a great job with an international cast.  This was a multinational production for European TV, and that gives a different flavor than an American production.",1461369600,,772,4.907692307692308

7884075,5,6305171734,"A compelling story about the journey home from Auschwitz to a comfortable life in Italy. I think that it could have had more depth and I will read the book for that. It was somewhat cheesy and sentimental. The music sets the tone for the whole film. Scenes that should have horrific were sanitized. It's hard to tell how good the acting really is when the film has been dubbed, it felt a little over the top but when you overlook all of that and get to the core story, a compelling story about the journey home, it's a lovely film.",1380585600,,531,4.267326732673268
7884076,5,6305171734,"This movie is based on a true story of survival at the end of WWII.  I just love this movie because it shows a period in history that has disappeared with time (thankfully).  It's of a man who was sent to Aushwitz, and survives it.  Then, at the end of the war, he must make it home.  It's a long, and at times troubling, journey.  It shows man's resilience to adversity.  I highly recommend this movie.  Everyone who's seen it said WOW!",1362787200,,437,4.2560975609756095

7884079,4,6305171734,"This movie is a cinematic rendering of Primo Levi's diary of how he traveled back to Turin Italy after spending over one year in Auschwitz.  Some parts of it are too sentimentalized and others don't truly show the conditions as they were just after the war.

The Auschwitz camp was way to neat and clean, and the flashback scenes were did not convey the brutality of the camps.  That aside, the rest of the movie is well done and thought out. The cinematic ambiance was spot on and the dilemma that awaited the 'survivors' is well explained.

It is hard to make this type of movie because you can either cartoonize the 'bad guys' and over romanticize the good guys.  Turturro does a great low key performance of Primo Levi (who was a very shy and reticent personality) that closely follows his book (the Truce or Reawakening) in story and feel.  It's just difficult to watch some of the side characters  especially the ""Greek"" and the ""Clown"".  They don't always add to the story and their actions seem to have lost something in 'the translation'.

But, all in all a good film.
