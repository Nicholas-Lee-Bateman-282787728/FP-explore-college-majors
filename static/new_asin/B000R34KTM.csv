3423698,5,B000R34KTM,"There's a couple of gags in this you've never seen before. This film is more about seeing entertainers and comedians that are lost in time. Some straight out of vaudeville. It's pretty nutty stuff...
and not good for your waistline....",1377820800,2,235,4.9
3423699,5,B000R34KTM,"This movie is hilarious from the first moment. Shirley Temple shines with laughing point after point, the music is great. And the moments of humor are simply great -- and even the kids can watch it.",1376092800,,198,4.527777777777778

3423702,5,B000R34KTM,"The first time I ever saw this, I was hooked, there are so many funny scenes and lines that will forever stick with you.
Although Shirley Temple has a supporting role, probably due to the fact that she was sooo young, she was great and extremely cute.
I just seriously love this so much, and it's very obscure, but I highly recommend everyone to see it, I guarantee you will enjoy and the title jingle of this short!
ENJOY!",1352073600,2,423,4.367088607594937
3423703,5,B000R34KTM,"Delightful short film. Shirley Temple doesn't sing but she sure is cute in this little spoof about her teacher, his infatuation with Dora (a sweets maker) and her talented classmates who end up performing a seemingly disastrous  radio commercial for Dora's novel donut creation.  In spite of this, the hilarious story concludes with a sweet ending.",1462060800,,348,5.196428571428571

3423719,5,B000R34KTM,"I absolutely LOVE Shirley Temple, and anything she's in!! There will never be a child quite like her!! This movie is silly, of course, because it's so old. But it's funny, and Shirley is adorable... it only lasts for about 20mins., but it's still super cute. If you love Shirley Temple, this is a cute movie to watch!! Hope this helps you!!

3423728,5,B000R34KTM,"If you are watching this little movie, keep your eyes on Shirley doing her comedy acts. I always believe that most great actors started out as being comedians.",1394236800,,159,4.714285714285714
3423729,5,B000R34KTM,"I picked this because I remember enjoying it as a child and my four year old daughter loved it!  If you want a short, sweet movie and, like us, are doing your best to keep your kids' (limited) media exposure as wholesome as possible, this is a must-watch!",1394064000,2,255,4.3125
3423730,4,B000R34KTM,"I love Shirley Temple movies and saw a lot of her singing, dancing movies when she was a bit older.  This was a little too slapstick for me, but was entertaining nevertheless.",1393027200,,175,4.46875
3423731,1,B000R34KTM,"Silly slapstick with a couple of scenes ""stolen"" by 4 year old Shirley. A movie that makes you glad that the ""Golden Age of Film"" ended quickly.",1392681600,,144,4.37037037037037
3423732,4,B000R34KTM,"Not exactly a Shirley Temple filmed, as billed, which is why we downloaded it.  Our 5-year-old has really enjoyed watching other Shirley Temple films.  She appears in it as one of the children in the teacher's classroom.  Nonetheless, this is a very charming and entertaining short film that made us laugh.  And the small appearance Shirley Temple makes is totally adorable.",1392595200,,374,5.081967213114754
3423733,5,B000R34KTM,"This is a cute short film from the Great Depression era. It's easy to imagine a theatre full of rumpled children laughing at the slapstick gags and irrepressible  pandemonium. 4 yr. old Shirley Temple has a minor role, but she's a dimpled dynamo in banana curls. Watch her steal the antics-filled radio show segment with her sparkling Satchmo impression on tiptoe. Lots of wacky mayhem served up with squirting donuts, a one-room schoolhouse and a side of radio days nostalgia.",1392422400,3,477,4.9625
3423734,3,B000R34KTM,"You can't watch a Shirley Temple movie without enjoying watching the cute little darling--this is one of her early movies, and it is old, but still worth watching.",1392249600,,163,4.857142857142857
3423735,5,B000R34KTM,"This is a great movie for us ""old timers"" who can remember the ""Lil Rascals shows"" I loved to watch these. I am sorry that she passed away but living to be 85 was a great long life.",1392076800,,181,3.789473684210526
3423736,4,B000R34KTM,I have watched and enjoyed Shirley Temple movies since I was young. It was fun to see one of her earliest shorts in this black-and-white mini-movie. Great comedy and singing.,1389916800,,174,4.833333333333333
3423737,5,B000R34KTM,Very cute film. Funny and I love seeing the old architecture and decor of the buildings shown In the film,1389139200,,105,4.3

3423741,2,B000R34KTM,"This is a comedy that is too slapstick for my taste. It's old and it shows its age with juvenile humor that is past its prime. Shirley Temple is one of the students of the teacher, not a main character. Watch it if you want to see Shirley as a tiny waif, but you've been warned.",1380412800,,278,3.982142857142857
3423742,5,B000R34KTM,"What a charming little film with the very young Miss Temple!  I thought I'd seen everything with Shirley Temple, so how wonderful to discover this delightful little gem.",1379030400,,169,5.035714285714286

8272169,3,B000R34KTM,"This 1932 short film runs under 20 minutes. It is about a middle-aged schoolteacher who has a crush on the local baker. When the baker creates a donut that can soak up one's coffee and float, the teacher sees his main chance into her heart. So, he decides to promote her creation with the aid of his students. Shirley Temple is one of his students. The result is pure mayhem, aided and abetted by slapstick comedy.

This 1932 film short  is streaky, filled with static, and in desperate need of restoration. Adorable four year old Shirley Temple is the standout in the film, stealing every scene in which she is featured. Slapstick comedy is not my thing, but if you love Shirley Temple, you will want to see it, as you will derive enjoyment by her mere presence in this film. She is simply too adorable for words.",1463788800,2,814,4.493243243243243
