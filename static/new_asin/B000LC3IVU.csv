It is difficult to watch this and think how the Soviets could have possibly won the war. Their situation is absolutely bleak. The abandoned and destroyed Soviet armor is vast.

You can imagine watching this shortly after it happened, and thinking that there was no chance for the Soviets. We see around Kiev the largest encirclement in military history. We see the bodies of Latvian nationals, mutilated after torture by the Soviet GPU. We see the Lithuanians welcome the Germans. Nice scene of a big Panzer II rolling in with a BMW motorcycle in the same scene. How different would the war have been had Hitler granted the 3 Baltic countries their independence again,and enlisted them on the side of Germany? Some horse-drawn ordnance-- unusual to see that. More unusual is to see the hundreds of soldiers on bicycles.

The program starts with the Finnish-Soviet War. We see a truck herding reindeer off the runway so that a Stuka can land. We see aerial shots of both the FW-190A and the Me-109. And Stukas and Ju-88s and He-111s.

A criticism of the program is that there is no overall picture given us; just endless scenes of victorious German soldiers marching ahead. With that annoying band music. If you know what will happen to these smiling German soldiers in the next year or two, deeper in Russia, it is all the more tragic to watch.

A problem with every episode in this series is the annoying band music. Way too loud, always. Wish we could turn it off. I watched it with the English audio off, and the German audio on, with English subtitles.",1368576000,2,1570,4.673913043478261
