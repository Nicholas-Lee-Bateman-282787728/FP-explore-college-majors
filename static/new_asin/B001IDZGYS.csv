8310830,3,B001IDZGYS,There was not enough content on the actual labor and delivery. We didn't see much. There was too much time spent on their personal story.,1323216000,,137,4.52
8310831,5,B001IDZGYS,"This engaging story of three homebirths in New York City is a great slice of the life of a midwife. But, unlike some other movies of homebirths, the focus is not on the midwife, but on the mothers--as it should be.

Different women, in different circumstances, have different and similar reasons for choosing to give birth at home. Women who are considering a homebirth, or even not considering one, should watch this movie. It will open their eyes to what this ages-old process actually entails.",1238025600,8,496,4.8352941176470585
