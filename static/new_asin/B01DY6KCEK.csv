7726101,5,B01DY6KCEK,Awesome Blu-ray collection if you love the Alien series. Some of the movies even come with the digital codes!,1479772800,,109,4.7894736842105265
7726102,4,B01DY6KCEK,"Got this on a Daily Deal that was too good to pass up.

This is not a boxed set. Just 7 movies bundled together with shrinkwrap. Still, it was a steal compared to buying them individually.

They are all one disc versions that come only with the cover insert. Only Prometheus comes with a digital copy on Ultraviolet. No Director's Versions or Extended Versions or Deluxe Versions here. Pretty basic.",1479686400,9,399,4.685714285714286
7726103,4,B01DY6KCEK,"Exactly as advertised. All 7 movies on blu-ray. The only thing that prevents this from being 5 stars is the digital copies. I wasn't expecting any, and if it had come with none, then 5 stars, or if it had come with all 7, 5 stars. Somehow 4 of the 7 had digital copies included, and 3 did not. For those wondering, there was no digital copy for AVP, Alien 3, and Alien Resurrection.",1479340800,6,382,4.175675675675675
7726104,5,B01DY6KCEK,"Ummmm folks, with tax... these movies come out to $5.32 EA for the Blu-rays!!!! You cannot pass this deal up! Do it!",1479168000,4,116,4.318181818181818

7726111,5,B01DY6KCEK,"Every time one of the Alien movies is on TV I find myself watching it, commercials and all, so I finally got off my duff and ordered this collection. With the exception of AVP 1 and 2, which I haven't seen yet, and Prometheus, which I saw once, I have seen the others multiple times. Also, Im probably one of three people on the planet who likes Alien 3but I digress.

The 7 movies came shrink-wrapped in a stack. All the movies were individually wrapped again as well in individual cases and appeared new. I removed the main wrap to take these pics front and back. I thought it might be helpful for some to see the actual covers. The versions of the movies sent may depend on the supplier. My supplier was Planet Fun Toys and the movies arrived in 2 days with Prime.

Heres more details on the specific versions I received. Back cover states that it includes:

Alien: 1979 theatrical version and 2003 directors cut. Special features: Audio commentaries, isolated score, deleted and extended scenes. Digital HD code that must be redeemed by 12/31/17.

Aliens: 1986 theatrical version and 1991 special edition. Special features: Audio commentaries, isolated score, deleted and extended scenes. Digital HD code that must be redeemed by 12/31/17.

Alien 3: 1992 theatrical version and 2003 special edition. Spine says widescreen. Special features: Audio commentaries, isolated score, deleted and extended scenes. (Note: Its rated R for Monster Violence :)

Alien Resurrection: 1997 theatrical version and 2003 special edition. Spine says widescreen. Special features: Audio commentaries, isolated score, deleted and extended scenes.

Prometheus: 2012 with digital HD code that must be redeemed by 9/8/18. Special features: Audio commentaries, isolated score, alternate beginning and ending. (Back cover movie slogan is Questions will be Answered. No, no they won't ;)

AVP: 2004 theatrical version and unrated extended version. Special features include audio commentaries, trivia track, and enhanced for D-Box Motion Control Systems, whatever the heck that means.

AVP Requiem: 2007 theatrical version and unrated extended version. Special features include audio commentaries, making of the movie, digital HD code that must be redeemed by 2/10/18.

Four of the seven movies have digital HD codes, but all those codes have expiry dates as stated above.

When I ordered this bundle, the Blu-Ray set cost only $2 more than the DVD set, so I splurged. It was a great deal compared to buying them individually. The plan is to watch them all again and then go see Alien: Covenant to add the cherry to this sci-fi sundae.",1493424000,15,2611,5.105633802816901
