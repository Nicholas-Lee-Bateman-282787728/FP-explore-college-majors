But it wasn't very good either.

The main problem is the writing - with a bunch of pretentious Poe and various literary quotes thrown in for no good reason just to make things sound intelligent.  It didn't work.  Some of the dialog, or rather mini-monologues, are quite embarrassing.

The gore?  Well, there is very very little.  I think they blew 90% of the budget on a fake head for the eye gouging scene.  Even that didn't look very good.

Essentially a pointless little film, with a group of unknown actors - some of which were good, and some of which were poor.  The two younger girls were probably the best of the bunch.

Sorry - but I hope they try again.  Just remember, if you're making a gory horror film, we really don't need all that nonsense dialog.  We want believable characters, stereotypes even.  If you're going to reinvent some for us, they've got to be better than this....",1265932800,,1076,4.526041666666667

I tried to watch it previously on netflix, but it would not play.
I decided to order it on amazon.com.
So glad that I did!",1232841600,,157,4.096774193548387
8284104,1,B001BP14LW,"Rips her eyeballs out because she thinks there are ants behind them. Honest. just like the description says. This movie is very close to being a contender of the ""Don't Look In The Basement"" Award of lousy, insane inmates films. Rent it. It's probably in the cheap aisle by now. I applaud anyone that gets behind a camera and makes movies. The trouble is most of todays filmmakers are into the 'torture porn' school of filmmaking. Don't get me wrong, I like a good horror/blood 'n guts film. The key word here is ""good"". Sorry folks, one star is all I can give and believe me I wish I could give more.",1222992000,2,601,4.375
8284105,5,B001BP14LW,"I received Pink Eye written by Joshua Nelson and direccted by James Tucker from Amazon. com today - yes, that's right folks - We support indie horror by BUYING the films whenever possible!!

The film stars the lovely and beautiful Melissa Bacelar (SKINNED ALIVE aka EAT YOUR HEART OUT) and the talented Joshua Nelson (THE BLOOD SHED, SKINNED ALIVE aka EAT YOUR HEART OUT) along with, a cast I like to refer to as the ""Six Degrees of Alan Rowe Kelly"" as they've all worked together in a number of films including AUNT ROSE, SKINNED ALIVE, THE BLOOD SHED, I'LL BURY YOU TOMMORROW, GALLERY OF FEAR, and we'll see many of them again in the upcoming remake of DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT. - Besides Joshua and Mellisa, The cast includes Zoe Daelman Chlanda, Alan Rowe Kelly, Raine Brown, and Susan Adriensen. A fine actor Joshua James plays the lead villain, Edgar, and does fantastic job playing a dramatic Edgar Allen Poe obsessed psycho.

Ok, I hate reviews that tell the story. If you want to read a review that tells the story, check IMDB - there's one there.
So, I'll get to the point: Buy the DVD.
Joshua Nelson writes a hell of a good story. It twists, it turns, sometimes unpredictably and it won't make sense where it's going until later, but it'll wrap up nicely. The ending scene was ""ehhhh, neither here nor there to me"", but that's ok... the entire story works with it or without it.

James Tucker directs the film beautifully.
He brings Joshua Nelson's story to life with horrifying imagery, technical astuteness, and simply beautiful camera work.

One thing I love about the ""Six Degrees of Alan Rowe Kelly"" group is that they work together, in film after film and no matter how big or how small the role they nail the role every time. The two child actresses in the film were incredible actresses that we'll hopefully see more of as they grow up.

The gore f/x were gruesome. The kills were appropriately written and cool as hell. Gore, blood, naked girls, a well written story, and beautifully acted parts all made this a film to be seen.

Buy it [...]

As an added bonus you'll get two episodes of Melissa's horror show called ""The Scream"" .. she's hilarious as a horror hostess conducting interviews, reviews, and the like! Melissa has joined my list of all time great horror indie actresses that includes Debbie Rochon, Raine Brown, Brooke Lewis, Zoe Chlanda, and Susan Adriensen (in no particular order). I love these women for all the horror that they bring to us.

Trust me, ""Best Horror Movies. com"" stated it correctly when they said ""You haven't lived until you've seen a young woman graphically rip her eyeballs out because she thinks there are ants behind them... awesome!!"" Fatally Yours says its ""very graphic, cringe-worthy, pleasantly gory."" and I say ""Ditto to both accounts.""

And near as I can figure, several of the cast believed enough in this story to put their money where their mouth is as you'll see them listed as executive producers too.
Now its your turn - put your money where their mouth is -- and go buy the DVD!",1222905600,5,3126,4.638336347197106
