8381213,4,B002UHZ6JG,Great DVD... Grayson Capps is one the best under rated performers in this day or centrury... His lyrics and music are transending...,1355443200,,132,5.045454545454546
8381214,2,B002UHZ6JG,"I personally thought this was terrible. Besides not being able to carry a tune, the audio and video quality was well below average. I guess I'm not as big a fan as the others who rated this DVD, but really, this guy is not that good. I got my copy for $2 and feel that's too much. Nobody I know wants it, even for free, so I canned it. Sorry Grayson fans this ones not much better than listening to a cat fight. If you want to see and hear a GOOD performer I would suggest Chris Smithers ""One More Night""

I wish Amazon had a 3 criteria rating that would make for a quicker, more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance
2. Quality of Audio
3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)

1.*
2.**
3.**

Artists that wish to have there performances recorded and recognized should be held to a standard. Poor Audio or Video, no matter how good the performance, is still a BAD product. Those who would still rank that product highly just because of performance are not doing the industry or the band justice. Demand better and we will get it, settle for less and that's what you'll get.",1281139200,,1113,4.311004784688995
8381215,5,B002UHZ6JG,"What a delight!  Grayson Capps is in his element talking, singing and entertaining the crowd.  This DVD is almost too much fun and the music is excellent.",1276387200,,154,4.666666666666667
8381216,5,B002UHZ6JG,"The small hall of Paradiso changed in a sanctuary the night Grayson Capps came to share his music. For the first time in Holland he was astonished to notice that a great part of the audience knew all the lyrics of his songs. It was a pity the audience sometimes sang along too loud, but still, Grayson succeeded in creating an intimate atmosphere, as if we were visiting him in his own house. The solo interpretation of at least 25 of his songs was magic, ensorcellating, at times nicer than the studio tracks....A few songs were unedited and will never be, as he ensured us...for example the cute short song he sang about his little girl cindy, at that moment far away over the ocean. This superb recording belongs in every home & heart of any Grayson lover, and also in the homes of the poor ones who don't know him yet....don't hesitate, Grayson Capps is worth his weight in platina!!
