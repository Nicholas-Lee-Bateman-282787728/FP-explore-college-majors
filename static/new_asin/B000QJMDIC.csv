8196622,3,B000QJMDIC,"It's okay...  Much too much talk about the history of the surrounding area (more like a visitor guide with waterfalls in the background) and little to none on the waterfalls, hiking location, pathways, etc.  Also - these are all the ""touristy"" and easy-to-get-to falls.  Very little challenge in hiking to them (half are actually viewable from the car).  I have been to all of the falls in this film - they are very beautiful falls - but so many that are just as easy to get to and/or have a slightly (very slightly) more challenging hike are omitted as are some stunningly gorgeous waterfalls in that area that require a 1/4-1/2 mile walk.",1472774400,,640,4.6371681415929205
8196623,5,B000QJMDIC,"This is an excellent educational waterfalls dvd.  I have several relaxing dvds as stressbusters.  However, this dvd is different in that it is very informative on the off the road locations and history of waterfalls in North Carolina.  The waterfall and trail safety information was wonderful.  Mr. Roberts narrates this waterfall program like a tour guide.  I really enjoyed this visit to the different North Carolina waterfalls.  I look forward to Part 2 and others.  Global warming and real property sprall is changing many areas for the worst, especially for nature lovers.",1186444800,2,577,5.206521739130435
8196624,5,B000QJMDIC,"The subject matter is not often available, so I was glad to receive
this DVD. Anyone who plans to vacation in the North Carolina Mountains
will find this helpful. The falls are located as to highways and road conditions.
The print is crisp, the background music appropriate, and the narration
informative. The only change I would like is to able to switch the audio
to with or without narration.  I think it  would be nice to be able
to listen to the water spray and the sounds of nature only.
I recommend this DVD!
I'm looking forward to the next one in the series.",1185408000,3,566,4.4326923076923075
