8538308,5,B009A8SCUS,"I've made a couple of Christmas wreathes in the past but this year I wanted to do one that I thought would be a little more complicated so when I saw this video available I decided to see what tips and tricks they could offer me - wow, what a lot of great ideas.  They walk you through it and gave me some even better ideas for the wreath project I will do this year - in fact, I may do a couple of wreathes and give one or more away.  Definitely a good visual to watch it on video, even better than the Martha Stewart book I bought, because it really is a nice step by step, just like being in the classroom with her.  Highly recommended.",1456790400,,639,3.9765625

She opens a world of designing to the crafter like I have never seen before.  This DVD will both teach you how to design and cause you to fall in love with the art of wreath making.,1435708800,,309,4.032786885245901
