4156314,5,B003N0QE3Q,"I only recently started watching Dexter after many people told me how good of a show it is.  I usually don't take anyone's word on these things because 99% of the time people seriously overhype everything.  To my surprise, this wasn't the case.  I watched the first and second season streaming on Netflix and instantly fell in love with the show.  Its written amazingly, and I couldn't get enough.  Don't let people fool you into thinking that one season is so much better than the others, because they all have their moments, and I was thoroughly entertained the entire time.

Definitely worth the purchase.",1287619200,6,608,4.798076923076923

4156316,5,B003N0QE3Q,"There are a lot of repetitive shows out there, about 100 regarding vampires, another hundred crime or law shows, etc. Yes, this is a crime show but they put a spin on it like no other. A serial killer who kills serial killers, rapists, murderers, etc? Awesome. The narration is actually amusing. The storytelling is amazing. I love it.

There have been many shows that have been great for one or two seasons, then really start to decline after that. This is not one of those shows. Right up through the fourth season, it just keeps getting better and better. It's nice to have it on DVD too, some of these episodes really leave off with a cliffhanger and if I had watched it on TV, I'd want to throw something at the screen.",1283731200,6,724,4.402985074626866

4156321,5,B003N0QE3Q,"Dexter has got to be one of the best shows on TV. The knowledge and creativity that went in to this show is superb in comparison to what we're used to seeing on TV. Even though it may offend some people who are a little more sensitive than the normal human, there is no doubt this show is one of the best on TV. It's 100% original and full of suspense; it actually keeps you looking forward to the next episode. It's rare for any show to keep me that anxious about watching the next episode, but this show does that.",1282003200,18,516,4.118811881188119
4156322,5,B003N0QE3Q,"Dexter, is a great show with an interesting twist for the concept.  The Hero of the show is a sociopathic serial killer who goes after criminal who have slipped though the justice system.  Michael C. Hall is fantastic and the plot will keep you watching disk after disk.  A must see, but be warned because it airs on Showtime show it is very graphic (probably not the best show if you're squeamish and don't have anyone to tell you when you can uncover your eyes).",1282003200,8,464,4.435294117647059

Although the series is interesting and fun to watch, the DVDs that I purchased are of low quality, skipping and breaking up in many sections.  Obviously, this ruins the enjoyment of watching the show.

4156337,1,B003N0QE3Q,"Dexter is a great series. I love the show. I'm writing this review because there are bootleg 4-packs floating around. I wouldn't even care, if the quality of the bootlegs was good. Dual layer dvd's would have been fine. As it is, the video quality of the shows are poor because the discs have been compressed to single layer DVDs. My advice is to buy the shows separately or buy the 4-pack directly from Amazon. Amazon has taken action to get me a refund. They've done me right. Just be careful what you buy. Non bootleg Dexter gets 5 stars.",1317945600,,541,4.42
4156338,5,B003N0QE3Q,"Michael C. Hall, the actor who played David Fischer in Six Feet Under, is a serial killer working for the homicide division in forensics.  However, he only kills serial killers, wraps them up in plastic, cuts their cheeks with a scalpel, and puts a drop on a slide with a glass cover.  He stores it in a box hidden in his the wall when he removes air conditioner - it looks like he has about 100 or so.

And he must keep ahead of being found out by his own fellow workers, his family, his girlfriend and other people who could out him.

But do the ends justify the means?

I think this is left to the audience to decide.  He was found by the police with his dead mother in a pool of blood, his older brother was there as well.  A policeman took him and adopted him as a son, along with his own daughter.  So was the violence he was introduced to as a child the reason he became a serial killer out to avenge his mother's death?  Or can he stop?  It is up to the audience to watch, listen and make a decision, or just watch and enjoy.",1317945600,,1033,4.044334975369458
4156339,5,B003N0QE3Q,"I really like the show, Dexter and consider it one of the best in recent years.  The acting, the directing, and the writing are all first rate.  The subject matter is somewhat morbid and for adults only, but it is very well done.

However, the quality of these CD's is pretty bad. It is even more frustrating because I really like this series.",1316476800,,343,4.412698412698413

4156347,5,B003N0QE3Q,"This is a great show. Amazing actors and actresses. Great story too.

The only down side is that the DVDs had trouble playing on my PS3. It had a few smudges and I cleaned them and it still wouldn't play. I tried on my neighbors son's portable DVD player and it allowed me to watch the first episode. I just believe I got a bad DVD. It happens. :) I returned it and got my money back.",1311033600,,384,3.987012987012987
4156348,5,B003N0QE3Q,"Buying the entire set of seasons 1-4 was well worth the money.  This drama can be watched a dvd at a time and last for two weeks of great entertainment.  I would definately say buy this product.  Get familiar with this program, it will be around for a while!  Spoiler alert, in Season 4, I was sad to know his wife died.  This could have been written out, because it is highly unlikely that this would happen in real life.  The only criticism I have about the series is the amount of tail that Dexter's sister Deborah gets.  She is too much of a tramp to like.  Her foul mouth is cute, but overdone sometimes.  The other office romances are also getting in the way.  Like Lt. Leguarta, she has slept with everyone, even wanted Dexter in Season 1.  She needs a toy from sex in the city to solve her issues. I don't think I could watch her in any other movies or shows knowing her charactor in Dexter.  To me, this role has made her tainted goods.  The writes should look at editing her out of the show.",1309564800,,1001,4.205263157894737

4156350,5,B003N0QE3Q,"With all due respect to Cheers and the first season of Twin Peaks, Dexter is putting up quite a fight for the top position in MY all-time list.

Is it possible to think of Dexter as therapeutic, because I definitely think he is!  His wit is infectious, ""murder monologues"" are on target.  I can't wait to see what they're going to do next!",1308528000,2,339,4.349206349206349
4156351,5,B003N0QE3Q,"When I watched the first episode of this show I didn't know what to expect...actually even after the first episode I still was a little unsure what I thought but as I delved more and more into the series I was COMPLETELY HOOKED. I HAD TO watch them all.

That being said, the concept of this show is not for everyone. Basic gist is that you are being transported into the mind and world of a serial killer. In this case, said serial killer kills other serial killers to help curb his urge to kill. What I like about the series is how well written it is and how intelligently they have approached the topic. This series goes where no series has gone before. It delves into what makes someone like this ""tick"", how they are different and how they are the same as the rest of society and by the end of the very first season you get to a point of almost understanding what that old debate of nature vs nurture really does stand for. As a matter of fact, it makes you relate so well you are actually able to follow and cheer Dexter on in his pursuits (Although you may feel oddly guilty about it lol) All in all, I really love the series. I highly recommend it for those looking for something very different and fresh (I especially recommend it to those that like shows like Law and Order Criminal Intent and Criminal Minds as this show will go where they would never dare and beyond) A great peek into a mind of madness (or maybe not as mad as you might think!)

So many shows are very similar to each other on TV these days, so no matter which one you're watching you feel like you're watching all of them at the same time.

The series is well written and well acted. The conversion to Blu-ray was good, despite the negative comments about that from some other reviewers. Picture was sharp and clear, and sound quality excellent.

What really surprised me about the series, though, is that this is a 'feel good' program. Dexter is a nice guy, in spite of his special needs. You identify with his struggles to appear normal, and cheer when he gets the bad guys. But most of all you cheer because despite himself, Dexter makes a success of being human.",1302048000,,639,4.8

I really just got into this show a week ago and liked the first season so much I bought the 4 pack and I loved it! Season 3 is a little slow in pace, but it was worth it to get to season 4.

Surprisingly enough.. I'm not a big fan of the Pilot, once you get past the first two episodes, it gets on track and really starts going full speed in the right direction!

There were network shows as I knew them before this and then Dexter happened and everything changed one fine day last year. A day when I was lying sick at home and feeling terribly bored - started with 1 episode of Dexter season 1 on Netflix and before I knew it, I had seen 4 episodes by the end of that day.
A week later, I had seen season 1, season 2 and season 3. And then in a matter of couple of more weeks,Season 4 was done too. Dexter is smart, chilling, thrilling and comic in its own right. The dialogue-writing is superb and so is the lead character played by Michael C Hall - I cannot imagine anyone else having done justice to this role. The music(the soundtrack rocks too). All in all, this series is a must watch.
I am watching Season 5 now and each episode this season has been a winner in its own right. Dexter.....u rock !!!",1291766400,2,1027,4.014634146341463
4156369,5,B003N0QE3Q,"The premise of Dexter (FBI agent commits murders, but doesn't ever get caught because he knows what the investigators will be looking for) sounds like it's a tired plot that would wear thin quickly. But then you get sucked in and realize how many ways to go about it and realize that, although it probably wouldn't work in real life, it works perfectly as a show's premise.
  Dexter Morgan was 4 when his father taught him to kill, but instilled the point that the victim must DESERVE it...ie: Either have killed someone else already, or threaten to expose his ""dark secret.""
  The first three seasons are, in effect, the first half of the entire length of the show (currently in its 5th season, ending next year with the sixth). They are pretty much individual of themselves...as long as you have seen episode 1, you can pretty much laze through the episodes in any order at your leisure.
  Season 4 is the search for the Trinity Killer. You will never look at John Lithgow the same way again (not a spoiler, his identity is given by the end of s4e2). YOU know who he is, before long Dexter knows who he is, but Miami Metro doesn't catch on for awhile.
  All I can say is don't try to tag on to the TV show now, s5e4, then decide to go BACK and watch these, because right now it's sort of pulling every season together, and much will be ruined. And ruining DEXTER is as big a crime as murder.",1291593600,2,1393,4.372093023255814
