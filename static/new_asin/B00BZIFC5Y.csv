Pretty hard to stuff this up you'd think? Just point the camera in the direction of the artists on stage, record the sound, and take some cutaway shots of the 'beautiful people' being stoned, dancing, laying about etc... Unfortunately 'writer and director' David Huggett has taken the original film recorded by Gordon Mutch and made a nauseating mess out of it.

Perhaps the film represents all the footage that survived after being 'lost' for 40+ years. If so, the DVD should have presented that raw footage (even as an extra) instead of presenting something out of an Allen Ginsberg nightmare. Seriously... who is the target audience for this? Seventy year-old colour blind stoners?

Whether it be the terrible computer special effects that are in evidence throughout the film, the Shakespearean re-enactments, or the drivel sprouted by Adrian Rawlins, or the fact few (if any) of the artists are presented for a full song..... this is one mess of a film.

The film is a disservice to the original footage recorded by Gordon Mutch, as well as being an insult to the fine artists that played at the festival.

Do not buy it. If you must, then buy mine. This is rubbish, and I will not watch it again.",1421020800,,1416,4.790983606557377
