THE MOVIE DOESN'T COVER HIS WHOLE CAREER",1324080000,4,122,4.3478260869565215

8466989,4,B005DKS202,"So here we have another biopic of a tragically lost rock singer and teen idol. We just saw this on Amazon Prime Video, so heres my take. Ricky Nelson was well played, and the music well performed. But Garden Pparty, his comeback anthem was never performed. The actor who played Ozzie Nelson didn't look or sound much like him. But the depiction Of overbearing parent was probably accurate. The actress who played Hariot did it right. She looked and sounded the part.
There is one question I have for the producers and writers on this project.  The story is told of a meeting with Elvis Presley. In this movie the king is just as excited about Nelson as he was about meeting Presley. I have heard that Travelin Man was written for Elvis by Nelson, but he couldn't get it to him because of Tom Parker. That song would have been a perfect fit for Elvis, and a perfect payoff for a storyline that went nowhere!
The bottom line here is that this is an entertaining little movie. It was worth the 90 or so minutes it took to view it. Made for VH1, take it for what it is. An entertaining look at the first made for TV musician. This really didn't happen again until The Monkees came along.",1512000000,,1183,4.377272727272727
8466990,5,B005DKS202,"I love this movie because I was a mega-fan of Ricky Nelson back in the day. I could tell immediately that this was certainly not a high-budget film, but it was far better done than other films about celebrities. I am happy that the parents were not unnecessarily vilified. They were a product of their time and tried their best to keep a family ""industry"" going for the benefit of all concerned, desperately holding on to financial security. I feel that the film was honest in the presentation of the anxiety and hostilities that brought so much damage into the life of Rick Nelson. How awful to be a has-been in your youth, disrespected for the very success that made you an international idol. Give this movie a chance. There's a lot here to learn.",1508716800,,750,4.562962962962963
8466991,3,B005DKS202,"Im not a big Ricky Nelson fan, but I know enough about him to understand he was a link in the early days of rock-a-billy & rock n roll.  He obviously had a great marketing advantage being on TV for many years, but at the same if he didn't have any genuine talent no amount of TV exposure would have made his music career.

This bio-pic was informative for me (never knew about his relationship with Lorrie Collins). In the movie were depictions of his life on the set of the family TV show, the beginnings of his music career, and the drama that went with a young man trying to find his identity.  I had hoped the movie would clarify the details surrounding his death, but the producers chose not to re-enact the plane crash. I thought the actor playing Ricky  Gregory Calpakis  gave a commendable performance and captured a lot of the quirkiness in Nelsons personality. I also thought Calpakis physically resembled Nelson; he didn't look any less like Nelson than other lead actors starring in bio-pics.  Actor Jamey Sheridan played Ozzie Nelson. He did a good job portraying someone trying to keep their family together, but also aware of where his income came from  a show that is about his family.

As a rock-a-billy fan I appreciated the inclusion of the Burnette Brothers, and James Burton. I also enjoyed hearing a few of Nelsons hits. However, the majority of songs in the movie were sound-a-likes written by Jonathan Goldsmith. In other words, you won't hear any of the songs Nelson wrote, such as Garden Party (could have been a limited budget for music licenses and synch fees). Singer Cal Dodd does the singing for Calpakis, and does a great job sounding like Nelson.

Several Nelson fans have left critical reviews. For the casual and uninitiated fan  like me  I thought the bio-pic to be informative and entertaining. Like Nelson use to sing, . . . you cant please everyone, so you got to please yourself.",1480636800,3,1919,4.64792899408284

8466993,1,B005DKS202,"Big mistake,I thought I was purchasing a DVD or a old VHS tape. I should make a habit of reading the fine print more but who purchases the rights to watch a 1999 made for television movie just so you can watch it on a computer screen?I mean who does that?Also the streaming signal kept dropping out over and over. One of the most stupid things I've ever did. Who else does this?
Also I've created a dam nightmare for myself as someone has went wild on my Amazon Account along with my Capital One Card charging stupid idiotic videos and movies from $1.99 to almost $23.00 a pop. From 08-20-2016 to 08-21-2016,they did or attempted it 7 or 8 times. I hope like hell they go blind from a stroke but life isn't that good.
We talked earlier this morning and you told me it would stop but I guess you were either lying or just blowing smoke. I'm really sorry you felt the need to do that but in 2016 it's tough to find anyone who really gives a dam about their job or business when it comes to John Doe Public.
The good people at Amazon have helped me get the situation under control even if you didn't because they do care about their customers. The situation for the time being should be under control and I will make dam sure it won't happen again after tomorrow.",1471737600,,1260,4.254166666666666

I loved Rick Nelson so thought the movie was ok.  Never knew that Ozzie was so overbearing.  I think we lost a great singer.",1435363200,4,137,4.230769230769231

8466996,1,B005DKS202,"I have been a fan of Rick Nelson since I was a young girl.  The first album I ever owned was Fools Rush In, and I saw him in concert in the early 1980s.  I did not know him personally, obviously, but based on autobiographical/biographical interviews and writings, this movie is an insulting, sensationalized account of his life.  It fails to recognize his place in music history, and portrays him as little more than a dancing chicken.  I wish there were negative stars.",1409443200,9,470,4.626506024096385
8466997,1,B005DKS202,"Hell no! This movie was a joke and a slap in the face to Ricky Nelson. For us who've grown up with his music and have read the books about him this is insulting. The acting is beyond horrible and the man who plays Ricky dosen't look anything like Rick. I agree with another review on here it doesn't even talk about his music career just his fights with Ozzie and Kris. And David and Harriet are barely in the film. I mean COME ON!! My 91 year old grandmother told me she watched, ""Ozzie and Harriet"" back in the day and told me while watching this film that someone just pulled this script out of their ass. I agree with her 150% If Hollywood actually takes their time and makes a decent proper script like they did with ""Walk The Line""  And if they pick a actor that looks like Rick and can sing then I'll watch it. But this is laughable and an insult to not only to Ricky but his family. Seriously? Try again.",1408752000,8,912,4.1525423728813555
