4683438,5,B005FNLUFQ,"The makers of the entire Shaun the Sheep saga are offering some of the best medicine around today. I am dealing with a progressive, degenerative disease that can easily put me in the dumps. It only takes single episode from any of the Shaun the Sheep DVD's (we have ALL of them) and I am laughing my head off and entirely out of the pit. ""We Wish EWE a Merry Christmas"" is definitely one of the funniest shows yet. The level of communication in each of the stories on this DVD is astonishing given the fact that there really isn't much verbal content, but everything is in the expressions, gestures and intonations of the various animal sounds, and the mumbles of the farmer. The sometimes shaky alliance between Shaun and Bitzer the dog is priceless throughout this package and often contains real moments of tenderness. That's one of the amazing things about this entire series. The very real human moments among the characters, ranging from all of the disgusting instincts of the pigs to the mischief always ready to happen with Timmy to the acts of kindness on the part of all of the animals to the bumbling and lonely farmer - all of that pulls on one human emotion after the other, and always with a quick and very happy push into uproarious laughter. Long Live Shaun the Sheep. He should be granted a Knighthood for outstanding service in the field of medicine. I'll take Shaun overr a pile of pills any day. (By the way, I'm 66 years old and sharing Shaun with my grandkids is one of the more enjoyable parts of getting old.)",1324080000,7,1533,4.537906137184115

""Shawn The Sheep: We Wish Ewe A Merry Christmas""
(Hit Entertainment, 2011)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Another nice installment of this British kid's series, with seven new episodes including some seasonal good cheer... The opening Christmas episode is nice, a heartwarming cartoon in which the farm animals rally together to give the lonely farmer a happy Christmas; the other cartoons are fun as well, following the now-standard STS formula.  An episode where baby Timmy's favorite toy gets trapped under a five-ton block of granite was particularly funny. If you like Shawn already, you'll enjoy this collection as well. Happy holidays!

4683442,5,B005FNLUFQ,"Wow.  Even more of my grandkids favorite, Shaun the Sheep.  We all love him and have watched the other videos more than a few times.  Grandkids are 10, 4, and 2 and they each love these stories!  The 10 year old suggested watching a video when he was here visiting cousins, The younger ones are FANS!! even had to order Shaun merchandise!! We love the new one as it has some very nice winter season stories, but the littlest one's favorite is how the sheep make Christmas special for the Farmer.  It is as good as Charlie Brown's christmas and these toddlers have watched this one everyday for 2 weeks.  Cannot recommend it highly enough.  Even my old hubby likes to watch these, just maybe not 10 times in a row....  Very funny stories!!",1321660800,7,738,4.455223880597015
4683443,4,B005FNLUFQ,"This is a very cute collection of Shaun the Sheep holiday/winter episodes.  While they are not all about Christmas, they definitely got my boys in the mood for the holidays and had them cracking up.  In the Christmas episode both the famer and animals do good deeds for each other and its nice to see they care!  Shaun the Sheep is great because it is a DVD that I don't mind watching with the kids as the humor is really for people of all ages!  Wholesome lessons with mischief and laughter!",1320710400,2,492,4.373626373626373
4683444,5,B005FNLUFQ,"I have never seen a Shaun the Sheep episode before. I was sent the DVD to review on my blog. I enjoyed the entire DVD so much I watched it twice in one day.

I realize people might see this as more of a ""kid"" program but I can tell you as a 40+ year old I thought the show was not only incredibly adorable but funny too. It's good, clean fun!

This is GREAT for the whole family.

There is only one holiday episode (which is very sweett). The other six clips are not holiday related (although two feature Winter/cold weather).

I loved this! I'm hooked on Shaun the Sheep and I'll have to pick up more DVDs.",1318550400,17,607,4.07563025210084
4683445,5,B005FNLUFQ,"it might be strange for a person  my age to find the Shaun the Sheep series so entertaining and downright funny, but  if you enjoy english comedy it becomes easy to understand just why they are so appealing to me.  Shaun the Sheep operates on two levels, the first is for children who can easily understand  and enjoy the antics of farm animals who constanly befuddle the human farmer.  the second is an adult level aimed at those  who enjoy the understated english sense of humor and the subtle sight gags that pop up throughout each story. In We Wish Ewe A Merry Christmas we find the farmer dressed as Santa distributing gifts to his farm animals.  the gifts are very simple, just fruit and veggies with makeshift wrappings.  Bitzer gets a new chewie.  even through the gifts are simple, it shows that the important thing is the thought behind it, not the gift iteself.  the animals follow the farmer  to his home and peek through the window and see that even though he gave them gifts, he had received none for himself and was sitting alone staring into the fire and thinking of happier times.  as he trudges of to bed, Bitzer and the Sheep decide to do something for the farmer.  they round up decorations and a tree and even knit him a colorful sweater.  the next morning, the farmer finds all this and his face lights up with supprise and amazement. the bell rings and the farmers family and lady friend have come to share the day with him, so he spends a happy Christmas day.  the story ends with all the farm animals standing outside while Shaun leads them in singing  songs of the season.  without preaching, the tale shows that it's more important to reach out and help others and the value of gifts depend on the thought behind them, not the value of the gift itself.  this is a very nicely done story with great attention to detail. no one can imagine the work that goes into the presentation of these stories.",1317513600,67,1923,4.477011494252873
4683446,5,B005FNLUFQ,"Christmas has come to the farm! Shaun and the sheep are at it again in this delightful DVD. My children love the Christmas episodes best, although all are enjoyable. If you are a Shaun fan, grab this for the holidays.

4683474,4,B005FNLUFQ,"Bottom Line First: Shaun the Sheep, We Wish Ewe a Merry Christmas is entertainment that has something for the old and young. Unlike most movies that make this claim, we have no annoying, adenoidal voices or hard pushes for toys nor even sneaky adult references to pander to the adults. Recommendation: Very simply 7 episodes of mostly visual entertainment, extremely family friendly and altogether pleasant, wholesome and light hearted.

We are two adults in this household. We do not demand that all viewing time be cleansed of the vulgar, sexual or violent. We have mostly given up on words like sophisticated as applied to our likes and dislikes. If we like it, we like it.

We like Shaun the Sheep.

I had bought We Wish Ewe a Merry Christmas after we saw and enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-the-Sheep-Movie-DVD-Digital/dp/B013H99V46/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun the Sheep Movie [DVD + Digital</a>] . We have also enjoyed some of the Wallace and Gromit shows. In saving the DVD until this December I was hoping for something of an in house Holiday Special absent the commercials and the preachiness artificial or otherwise in the usual holiday fare. This disk was what we wanted.

The Christmas episode is about giving, but the lesson is demonstrated not hammered. Instead your family gets a fun and funny mostly pantomimed story. The main characters are barnyard animals and their human owner, but there is very little talking and just enough sounds, to keep things interesting. The pantomime gestures and well done drawn faces carry all the meaning we need. No one needs to tell you that the sight of an animal knitting a sweater directly from the wool of another sheep can be funny. More so if the wool has been dyed in many colors while still on the sheep. What is clever is that this image part of a larger scene and used to add to the humor of a larger shot.

The other 6 episodes keep with the theme of winter time. A heavy snow grants the animals a snow day. Blitzer, the dog gets a new hat and his friends, led by Shaun go to extremes to return to him his old one. The farmer build a makeshift wind generator and of course the animals turn it into a carnival ride.

For us this was a nice break from what can be a season of too many and too much. We Wish Ewe a Mary Christmas is relaxed, fun and will make for a seasonal family movie night even after the youngest claim to have outgrown it.",1481328000,,2464,4.772300469483568

StS is wonderful for the whole family.  The teenagers snipe before Shaun goes in the DVD player, but they are wrapt while it is playing.

The other shorts are similar Shaun the Sheep episodes you will find on any of the other DVDs. Is it worth it... yes. The Christmas episode is very touching and my 5 year old daughter understood the Spirit of Christmas that the episode was trying to convey.",1357257600,,370,4.455882352941177
4683561,5,B005FNLUFQ,The creativity involved in putting this together is phenominal.  The story line was well written and thought out.  I loved how the sheep and the dog made a special Christmas for the farmer.  DELIGHTFUL!!!!,1357257600,,205,4.970588235294118

A friend commented that they could be watched anywhere in the world as there are as a rule no words spoken.  There was one short video I personally didn't enjoy as much on this recording as I'm not partial to seeing runny noses!

4683582,3,B005FNLUFQ,"Docked two stars -- one for the misleading cover and the other for the inadequate product description.  This is a set of seven Shaun the Sheep videos, only one of which is about Christmas.  The cover makes it look as if this is all about Christmas.  The description simply says that the running time is 50 minutes.  It does not say that there is only one Christmas video that runs for seven minutes.  Don't get me wrong.  We love Shaun the Sheep.  This is five-star content.  What we don't like is misleading marketing.  Had I known the particulars of this DVD before, I would not have bought it.",1325376000,18,596,4.444444444444445
4683583,5,B005FNLUFQ,"After having previously watched the intro to Shaun the Sheep DVD, OFF THE BAA!, I decided to pick up WE WISH EWE A MERRY CHRISTMAS when it was on sale during the Christmas season. I really enjoyed the episodes of SHAUN THE SHEEP that I had watched before and I was eager to see what holiday adventures the Shaun and the flock would get into. Though all of the episodes on this DVD are funny, there is only one Christmas episode and only two others that have anything to do with winter. There are seven episodes total on WE WISH EWE A MERRY CHRISTMAS and they are all from Season Two of SHAUN THE SHEEP. The episodes are:

""We Wish Ewe a Merry Christmas"" - the Farmer loves Christmas. He dresses up like Father Christmas and gives each one of his barnyard animals a special Christmas gift. Part of the episode flashbacks to the Farmer as he was growing up and showing the absolute joy he has for the holiday. However, this year the Farmer will be spending Christmas alone and this saddens him greatly. The flock decides to do something about the Farmer's sadness and go about making Christmas decorations, cutting down a tree, decorating his house, and getting him gifts so that he won't feel so bad come Christmas morning. There's a lot of humor in this episode and a whole lot of heart. However, this is my favorite episode of SHAUN THE SHEEP that I've seen so far. In a short six-and-a-half minutes, this little cartoon brilliantly displays what the spirit of Christmas is about. Though the message of Jesus's birth is not displayed at all in the episode, the grace, hope, and joy that that birth brought into the world is clearly illustrated and displayed.

""Snowed In"" - the sheep awaken to find the door to the barn shut-tight because of a mountain of snow that has drifted against it. They climb out the window and play winter games. Meanwhile, the Farmer finds his door can't be opened because of the snow, too. However, he's determined to go skiing and finds a way to do so.

""Fireside Favorite"" - Blitzer gets a serious cold and the Farmer brings him inside and has him sleep in front of the fire. Pidsley the Cat doesn't like it that the Farmer has given away his favorite napping spot and begins plotting on a way to get rid of Blitzer and get his favorite spot back.

""An Ill Wind"" - After getting an unbelievably high electric bill, the Farmer decides to put up a wind mill to power the farm.

""Blitzer's New Hat"" - the Farmer decides Blitzer's old hat must go and forces him to wear a horribly looking new hat. The flock tries to cheer him up by finding an even new headpiece. Meanwhile, Shaun attempts to get Blitzer's old hat back.

""Chip Off the Old Block"" - the Farmer decides to become a sculptor and unloads a huge block of stone into the farm yard. Unfortunately, the stone lands on Timmy's teddy bear. Shaun and the flock attempt to retrieve the toy from beneath the sculpture.

""Shirley Whirley"" - Shirley has become so heavy that she can no longer move very well on her own. Shaun attempts to fix the issue by placing Shirley on wheels. At first things seem to work, but then technology interviews and Shirley goes for an unexpected whirl.

All of the episodes on WE WISH EWE A MERRY CHRISTMAS are now available on SHAUN THE SHEEP SEASON TWO. If you're a serious fan of Shaun and the flock, I recommend buying that. However, if you're a casual fan, someone who is just curious about the show, or wanting to introduce someone to the series, WE WISH EWE A MERRY CHRISTMAS is a good place to start.",1325116800,7,3519,4.453416149068323
4683584,5,B005FNLUFQ,"Another great Shaun the Sheep adventure, this one with a Christmas theme.  While watching with my grandsons, one of them turned to me in the middle of viewing and stated, ""I love this!""  What could be a better review? This is a delightful DVD; there are 7 episodes of winter fun that will make you laugh and feel all warm and fuzzy.  The boys have watched this at least 10 or more times since they received it for Christmas only a few days ago.  Shaun has been a big hit in the family this past year and this DVD was definitely the year-end topper!  Great purchase, we are sooooo pleased with this!",1325030400,,598,4.303571428571429
4683585,5,B005FNLUFQ,"My husband is a big fan of Wallace & Grommit and claymation works in general. He loved it. Kids loved it, too. I am just always amazed at all the work that goes into making such productions. Cool.",1325030400,,196,4.184210526315789
4683586,5,B005FNLUFQ,"We love Shaun the Sheep.  It's great; my girls LOVE it.  However, if you have Season 2, all of the episodes here on already in Season 2, so don't double up.",1324684800,41,156,4.0

8470323,4,B005FNLUFQ,"Shaun the Sheep is always entertaining. The biggest disappointment is simply that it is mostly a collection of episodes from the show which can be found on the Season 1-2 or Season 3-4 disks. It would have been nice if ALL the episodes chosen had a Christmas theme running through them, but that didn't even happen.",1515715200,,315,4.642857142857143

We have a few of the seasons already so my daughter has seen all these episodes. The description doesn't say anything about it being a collection of episodes so it's a little deceptive. Overall, it's a cute movie. I just thought it was something else :)",1514592000,,426,4.3375
8470327,5,B005FNLUFQ,"My family loved this video. Each episode was full of laughs. Characters do not actually speak, but the farmer kind of mumbles, and you're never left wondering whats going on. My 5 year old absolutely adored the entire thing. My husband and I chuckled right along with her. These are witty, relaxing, and good wholesome family fun.",1514332800,,330,4.807017543859649
