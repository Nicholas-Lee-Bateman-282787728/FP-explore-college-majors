I will say that I've seen quite a few silent serials and ""Lightning Bryce"" is by far one of my favorites. The action in this 15 chapter serial is just about non-stop; and the acting, locations, and cinematography are all first rate.  Each chapter is about 25 minutes long and the total running time is 320 minutes (or five hours and 20 minutes).  That's a lot of bang for the buck (pardon the pun).

Attractive movie heroine Ann Little proves that she can out ride and out shoot just about any cowboy in the West. In chapter three, a band of outlaws has surrounded her cabin.  One of the outlaws breaks down the front door by riding through it on his horse.

Ann aims her pistol and shoots the outlaw off his horse in the middle of her parlor.  She then jumps on the wounded outlaw's horse and rides out the front door shooting at the other outlaws.  I can't say that I've seen a cowgirl do that in any other Western.

And this brings us to Ann's big, handsome, and likable co-star Jack Hoxie (who wears an even bigger ten gallon hat).  Jack is one of my favorite Western stars. He was especially effective in his silent Westerns, but he also held his own when the sound era arrived.

Another thing that I like about Jack Hoxie is that he wore his twin pearl-handled pistols with their handles pointed forward.  Tim Holt, another great cowboy hero, did the same thing with his six-shooters. And both Jack and Tim were dead shots.

Grapevine Video has done a nice job with this serial, piecing it together from a number of different source materials. The visual quality varies from chapter to chapter and the entire serial is watchable, but don't expect Criterion Collection quality. Please remember that this is a rare Western silent serial, so it is really nothing short of a miracle that we have it in any form at all.

Lastly, Jack Hardy's musical score for this serial is truly amazing.  It is soaring, and sweeping, and proves that silent films were not really silent.  Hardy's music for this serial is as big as the West itself, and it perfectly accompanies the action in ""Lightning Bryce.""

""Lightning Bryce"" is a really fun and exciting Western adventure made in 1919 starring Ann Little and Jack Hoxie, two nearly forgotten silent film stars who are well worth rediscovering.",1496361600,,2447,4.61431870669746
8539536,5,B009CC58ZE,"""Lightning Bryce"" is a 15-chapter serial released in 1919, one of the few made in the silent era to survive in reasonably complete form, and typical of these it was not from one of the major studios.  The credits list ""Produced by The National Film Corporation of America"" and ""Distributed by Arrow Film Corporation, New York.""

Two old prospectors, Bryce and Arnold, have found a hidden and, they believe, forgotten cache of gold.  To keep it from falling into the wrong hands should something happen to them, Bryce writes the location on a string which he has wrapped tightly around a knife blade, so the message can only be read by those in possession of both the knife and the string.  The string is to be given to Arnold's daughter Kate (Anne Little) and the knife to Bryce's son, Lightning (Jack Hoxie).  But an Indian tribe regards the gold as sacred, and through use of a drug the prosepectors are soon dead.  The string and knife are given to Kate and Lightning, but an ""unscrupulous outlaw,"" Powder Solvang (Paul C. Hurst, who also directed the serial), finds out about the message, and the chase is on for the remainder of the 15 chapters.

Anne Little shows fine acting ability, and while this was not one of Jack Hoxie's known attributes he gets through the action scenes decently enough.  The plot doesn't always make much sense, and it doesn't move very fast, but the locations are varied, including a chapter set in Chinatown of Los Angeles, with automobiles of 1919 and unpaved streets.  While much of the action is familiar from Westerns and Serials, the padding has a few interesting twists, with the Indians having a sort of Television, in the form of a Crystal Ball that shows who has possession of their sacred gold nuggets, a well-done technical effect for the time this film was made.  There's also a Mystery Woman, watching over Lightning, often shown with the image blurred suggesting a mystical quality.  The cinematography is by Herbert Glennon, one of his earliest efforts in a long career in movies and television, and includes some fine artistic effects.

Grapevine's edition is on three single-layer DVD-R discs.  The image quality varies due to the condition of the prints used, and none of it is really sharp, but gray scale is adequate, framing is good and only a few places show significant film deterioration.  One ""next week"" title appears to have been created for the video release, and a few intertitles have been captured from individual frames.  Grapevine adds their logo on some of the intertitles, unobtrusively in the lower right corner, but otherwise keeps it off the screen.  That multiple source prints were used is most obvious in the text of the ""synopsis of previous episodes"" where different fonts, layouts and image sharpness is seen  There seem to be a few variations in description of the plot; for example the reference to ""Los Angeles"" is changed to ""a nearby city"" in a later chapter.  A couple of the ""recap"" titles are a little hard to read, and one is missing, but given the fate of similar films the image is good and serial is remarkably complete.  Jack Hardy's orchestral music score is too ""modern"" in style; this and the wide-range stereophonic sound are at odds with the ""vintage"" qualities of the print, but the music is well-coordinated with and supportive of the action.  I find it far less distracting played at low volume, monaurally through a small loudspeaker.

While containing a lot of the usual serial-movie padding, the plot moves along well enough if the chapters are watched with a day or so between them.  Grapevine has done a fine job of presenting this serial, their efforts fully deserving a five-star ""I love it"" rating.",1493769600,2,3705,4.801574803149606
8539537,5,B009CC58ZE,"I really like this serial. I'm a fan of all the old serials, and even enjoy the few silent serials I have watched.  I usually haven't liked silent films, but I think the serials have grown on me.  And I really enjoy seeing old locations, buildings, vehicles, clothing, etc. which are really not found anywhere now but in old movies.

This one is a good long running movie, typical storylines from serials but also many subplots and other things I have not seen in other serials, although I do have quite a lot I still want to get through. This has a love story, mystery, tragedy, serial action scenes, with stolen treasure and some supernatural aspects thrown in.  This all made the story interesting for me.",1476921600,,708,4.595238095238095
