The audio, eng subtitles, and video quality are excellent. My favorite drama that got me in to kdrama. Its a classic.",1448409600,,244,4.212765957446808

8688536,4,B00PL6VNI6,"5 stars for the show itself and only 4 stars for the DVD release.

The sound quality is exceptional, the subtitles are excellent, but the video quality is not up to standard.  For some reason this is sub-DVD quality with highly noticeable pixelation and frequent motion blur.  When I watched it on Netflix the visual quality was significantly better.  Overall worth it as this is a difficult to find Korean television release that actually plays on all DVD players.  Highly recommended.",1424131200,3,486,4.950617283950617
