8344150,5,B001UL7SE4,This is the only reason I let my son watch Barney. This DVD is awesome. It has a lot of good nostalgic songs and some you never heard of that are still fun. I didn't know many kid songs before and this gives you a lot to go with. And there is very little downtime which just means less time for your kid to lose interest. (my son is 18 months and he has liked this one for about 5 months now and can watch a good 20 min then go in and out for a while.),1375315200,,452,3.670103092783505
