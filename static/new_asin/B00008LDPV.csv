1850365,5,B00008LDPV,"One word: WHOA! (apologies to Keanu bashers). Final Fantasy was merely a vehicle for Square's animation breakthrough and it showed. The novelty eventually wore off leaving you with a feeble, pointless story that should never have made it to the big screen. FFO has everything FF lacked: dynamic action sequences that would be difficult (if not impossible) to execute in live action, characters you actually CARE about and, most importantly, BREVITY. Don't get me wrong, being a HUGE Matrix fan I thought it was way too short. But crammed into those exquisite nine minutes were some of the best action sequences I've ever seen. The same level of excellence would be difficult to sustain throughout a feature-length movie. FFO is the perfect teaser for Reloaded. Well worth the price of admission all by itself and, IMHO, should win the Oscar for Best Animated Short. I can't wait until May 15th!",1049241600,,894,4.966666666666667

1850367,4,B00008LDPV,"With the eagerly awaited The Matrix-Reloaded & Revolution, the directors have given us a treat to eyes & mind.
These superbly made movies are a sure no-no-miss.
They have already uploaded 2 of the movies on their website and coming up with two more (April'03 & May'03). And then in June you get to see all the 9 with Dolby 5.1.
One of the movie 'The Final Flight of Osiris', can be seen with shows of 'Dreamcatchers' movie, by the makers of 'The Final Fantasy-The Spirits Within' is a animation blower (& also suppositely a prelude to the Matrix-Reloaded Movie).
I can't comment on all the movies, but yes after seeing the two online ones I can say, you can't afford to miss any.
The direction is superb, story line is superb. One of these include voice by Keanu (The Kid) & one with voice of Carry En Moss.
I would suggest you to have a look at the matrix website (Animatrix section) to have an idea about all the movies. They have two liners explaining each of the Animatrix movie. Also watch the on-line movies before buying it.
Some people, not very keen on Animation stuff, may not find it too cool. You can catch The Matrix-Reloaded then..
You can run but you cannot hide from the Matrix fever.

The voices of Neo and Trinity are featured in a couple but none of the actual stars of the movies are seen.

1850417,2,B00008LDPV,"Having recently enjoyed the first two Matrix films (the original more so than Reloaded), I decided to continue my experience through the library. Conveniently, I received both The Animatrix and The Matrix: Revolutions (or Revelations), and so I was able to watch them in sequence. Today I'll be tackling the nine anime shorts that serve as...well, it's difficult to classify what exactly to call these unrelated mini-flicks (although a few words I plan on not using in my review come to mind). Anyway, let's begin with some background.

The Matrix is an extremely good, extremely original action film from all the way back in 1998, but which manages to remain just as gorgeous looking today. For my younger readers, think of it as the previous generation's Inception, and you pretty much have it. Granted, there were some plot points I took issue with (most notably how the heroes go about killing the very people they're supposed to be saving), but that's really irrelevant here.

Although I'm by no means a huge fan, you could make the case I grew up with anime, albeit of the popcorn variety shown on Tonami afternoons on Cartoon Network. Still, as I've gotten older and my interests have expanded, so has the anime I've viewed: everything from Gundam WING to most of the Pokmon series to Dragon Ball Z and the original to Death Note and High School of the Dead. I'm not really sure what this says about my taste in anime (although I might add I highly enjoy Spirited Away, proudly own a copy of Steamboy, and was rather baffled by Howl's Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke). I suppose you could consider Final Fantasy: Spirits Within and Advent Children anime as well, along with Resident Evil: Degeneration and Damnation, so I'll throw those out as well.

The Animatrix most closely resembles none of these, considering that it's nine separate stories that aren't really even connected via anything other than all being set in the same universe. To me, it seems closer to a collection that was certainly inspired by it, Halo Legends, although Legends was, for the most part, a more cohesive story than these, since it took place more or less all within the same forty year span. The Animatrix is spread all over the place, and never really manages to introduce any characters I found particularly memorable (there are two exceptions, detailed below). Anyway, let's dive right in and examine each piece individually.

Continuing my Legends comparison, I have to quibble about Animatrix's order. The Halo anime started off with its origin story (called, rather creatively, ""Origins, Parts I and II""), but the Animatrix starts with action, so we get ""The Last Flight of the Osiris"" instead. It wouldn't be so bad if ""Osiris"" was a stronger piece; sadly, it isn't. It suffers from the same problem Square Enix had with their previous anime, Spirits Within: namely it was populated by characters I felt no connection to whatsoever. To be fair, it seems unrealistic to expect the same studio to accomplish in nine minutes what they couldn't do in over an hour, but still.

Supposedly this one got screened in theaters as a prequel to Reloaded. I don't remember this, but then I was about nine at the time, so it's understandable. The short starts off with what is quite possibly the worst choreographed fight scene I've ever seen, which quickly and predictably dissolves into shameless fan service as a man progressively undresses his girlfriend with a katana. We get a big, five second shot of her butt cheeks through her thong, and by this point I've already consigned this one to the ""Are you kidding me?"" pile, but it keeps going. Soon enough things go bad: sentinels attack the ship, which has just stumbled upon the drilling machine attacking Zion (object of the main battle in film three), forcing them to make a suicide run for the surface, in order to broadcast to humanity and warn of its impending destruction. We get some very Mirror's Edge-esq sequences (although I suspect DICE was copying this, and not the other way around, given the years between the two), but in the end I'm just left wondering why I care. The crew's ultimate sacrifice (alluded to with a throwaway line in the second film) is expected from the get-go (plus, you know, the title),  but Enix just can't make me feel anything for them. Perhaps with a full-length movie they could've pulled it off, since some actual development wouldn't been possible, but as it stands, the cast feels mostly like retreads from the first film (we have a strong, bald, black captain, a nasally white pilot, a strong female lead, etc.). Overall, ""Osiris"" is a swing and a miss, despite its gorgeous visuals.

The next piece (which ought to have been the first) is entitled ""The Second Renaissance."" This is the tale of humanity's downfall, but while the art is a little wonky, it isn't the story's main problem. No, it's the fact that, after watching about a minute of this short I'm left thinking humanity got exactly what was coming. I mean, I know it's all cool and lefty to make humans the bad guys, but seriously? This is like making a movie about Israeli occupied Germany focusing on the resistance, then making another film detailing the Holocaust. It completely destroys any sympathy I have for the characters, all the more so since humanity seems to be comprised of a bunch of extremely stupid bullies. The machines (who were apparently created self-aware, since someone decided to skip step two of the Robot Apocalypse) repeatedly attempt to coexist with humanity, but humans just seem incapable of this. A particularly memorable scene involves a lynch mob beating a young woman to death with a sledge hammer while she frantically screams ""I'm REAL!"" It's the sort of image the reboot of Battlestar Galactica or its tragically short-lived spinoff Caprica could've pulled off, but here it just seems horrifying and unjustifiably pointless. (There's also gratuitous nudity, since the skin-job is fully equipped). The only other image that comes to mind is one of UN troops in the trenches just before the final battle, as the Pope and various other religious leaders exhort them. It gives you an interesting look at how humanity has united, but it doesn't manage to feel positive; you get a sense of the hopelessness of these guys, though, which is almost as good.

Anyway, humanity commits atrocity after atrocity, but the machines roll with the punches every time, eventually forcing the UN to accept surrender and the Matrix. This isn't before humanity darkens the sky and destroys most of its own civilization (the machine city of 01 from Revelations, nestled deep in Iraq, is bizarrely totally accepted in the super-stable and famously tolerant Middle East). Nuclear warheads are equally ineffective (ignoring that EMPs are Zion's only hope for combating the Machines in the films), which is yet another plot hole in a short starting to look like Swiss Cheese. There's a throwaway line about liberal humans siding with the robots to demand an equal right to life (a bizarre choice considering how closely the opposite side mirrors the real-world Pro Choice movement, but I digress); after one clash with police, this group is never seen or heard of again.

After watching travesty after travesty, the machines win, and I'm none the wiser about where the title came from, who first developed the Matrix (the Architect and Oracle should be main characters, but are never mentioned), or how the first minds were freed. I did gain a new question, however: After everything I've seen, why do I want humanity to win?

Coming on the heels of what we just saw, ""A Kid's Story"" is extremely jarring, and that's without even getting into the irritatingly shimmery art it features. This one is quite possibly the most distracting art in the entire collection, no mean feat. It follows the story of...that kid who kept following Neo around in the second film. You remember? No? Well, I didn't make the connection until after watching it. My first take was ""This is crap,"" and it still makes no sense for Agents to just show up at a school for no reason and starting trying to waste a kid, but anyway...Thinking about it, the story climaxes with the titular character plunging off a roof to escape the Agents, freeing himself through suicide, a disturbing message if ever there was one. On the positive sides, it features Keanu Reaves and Carrie-Anne Moss (something the Halo anime was sorely lacking) and ties more or less well into the overall series, but considering the overall Judeo-Christian theology the series seems to riff off (with Neo as an extremely dark Christ figure), it irks me that the final line amounts to ""Salvation comes from within, not without.""

""Program"" is similar in approach to the fight between Neo and Morpheus in the first film, but it quickly devolves into a bizarre fantasy Samurai battle that makes little sense. It's not overall a bad piece, though it adds very little to the overall series. Still, it comes about as close as anything else to being a completely flawless entry.

Undoubtedly the worst is ""World Record"" which has absolutely nothing to do with the series, manages to make the Agents look extremely stupid, and is, on top of that, borderline racist. It revolves around a champion sprinter who can run so fast he actually breaks the Matrix (something that shouldn't even be possible, but whatever). An extremely unimpressive Agent (who looks like...a cheesy anime villain rather than the more or less faceless automatons they were in the series) attempts to stop this...somehow, the sprinter pulls his everything, and the last scene is of said idiotic Agent screaming at the athlete he'll never walk again. The story makes very little sense and brings not a blessed thing to the canon; it's a waste of time. On top of that, the artist has clearly never actually seen a black man: the main character looks hideous. Watching the looping one second frame on the chapter select menu, I actually thought he was some sort of monster. This is by far the collection's low point.

Continuing the trend of mood whiplash is ""Beyond,"" by far the best of the lot. It revolves around a group of Japanese children who discover a glitch in the Matrix, which takes the form of a haunted house. This whole concept was my favorite one from Reloaded, and to see it play out here in this way is awesome. It reminds me very much of Spirited Away, and I'd love to see a full-length version of this.

This one was a tough call. I first saw screens of ""Detective Story"" on IMFDB, and was sold upon seeing Agents wielding .50 Action Express Desert Eagles. This chapter revolves around a PI about to hang up his fedora, when he gets a call from a mysterious client, asking him to track a hacker known only as Trinity. After a little indecision (and some financial aid), the PI comes around, and begins the hunt. He learns he's not the first man for this job; three others have been contracted. One killed himself, one vanished, and the third is insane. A visit to this unfortunate doesn't shed much light, but the PI catches up with Trinity anyway...one step ahead of the Agents. I was really hoping this one would play out one way, but complete cop-out ending ruined that for me. I'd love to see a full-length version of this as well, albeit one with a different, not so downer ending that doesn't make me dislike one of the main characters.

The final story is ""Matriculated,"" and it makes about as much sense as its title. While the premise is solid (Resistance kidnaps a robot and plugs it into their own Matrix, hoping to cause to empathize with them), it died pretty early on for me when the main lead doffed her space suit. Underneath she was wearing some sort of super-tight leather top, panties, and heels, and I was so distracted by my constant ""Why doesn't she put some pants on?"" that I really couldn't follow the rest. It doesn't help any that ""the rest"" consists of some extremely garish and bizarre set pieces that make no sense whatsoever and drag on for far too long. The writers ought to have either scrapped this one or shortened it; it's the longest of the nine, and it drags. Granted, Reloaded dragged too, and in places it didn't need to, but somehow this seems worse. It doesn't help any this interesting premise is never referred to again (Big Lipped Alligator Moment anyone?), which seems to me as if the Brothers Wachowski realized it was bad and dropped it like an ugly baby. And on this note, the collection ends.
 So, here's my tabulation:

The Good: Well, there's something wrong with every story, even the ones I liked. I guess the best they can hope for is that they aren't really bad per say, just not amazing.
""Beyond"" This one makes the entire collection worth a single viewing. It's the one story that can stand as anime in addition to being a Matrix short. My only problem is that it's ultimately forgettable.
""Detective Story"" A great noir piece with amazing artwork, this could've made the entire thing worth owning but for its awful ending. A major disappointment, but I just can't quite bring myself to hate it.
""Program"" As illogical as this short is, it isn't actually bad. It's just not good.
The Bad: Again, this is all relative. None of the shorts listed here are without merit, but they're just a little too off the wall for me.
""Kid's Story"" The art and illogical nature of this story got me. The writing and acting are great; it's just too jarring.
""Last Flight of the Osiris"" This one is nothing but fan servicy eye-candy. The art is great, but it has no substance at all.
""The Second Renaissance"" I outlined my rationale above. Mainly, were it not for the two scenes I mentioned there, this one would be utter garbage. As is, it's disturbing and disgusting. Then again, maybe genocide should be.
The Ugly: Honestly, these two are equally bad. There's no equivocation here.
""World Record"" Is pointless and grotesque. I have a hard time putting a 500m dash on the same level as the fight for humanity to survive.
""Matriculated"" This one is just distractingly odd. It has a solid premise, which it quickly smothers with strange art and a little dab of fan service.

 Overall, the Animatrix is a pretty weak anime collection. While some stories do have merit, none of them are perfect. Honestly I can't think of a single audience that could enjoy everything here; while some might say this is variety, I see it as narrative incohesion. It's just not something I can ever see owning or recommending to anyone else.",1376524800,,14545,4.773847376788553

1850456,4,B00008LDPV,"While anime-styled productions like Dark Fury, Batman: Gotham Knight, and Van Helsing: The London Assignment try to act as tie-ins to existing movie franchises, The Animatrix was one of the first of these types of animated films. Originally an online series (or ""ONA""), this was a compilation of nine episodes, all dealing with seperate aspects of The Matrix trilogy. Four of these episodes premiered online, while the rest of them were first featured on the video release of the complete movie.

The first story, Final Flight Of The Osiris, was animated by Square Pictures, who also did Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. This acts as a direct prelude to The Matrix Reloaded where the human crew of the hovercraft Osiris discover that the machine army is drilling directly into the underground city of Zion, so they send their Aeon Flux-wannabe into the Matrix to deliver this news to the humans. Unfortunately, the machines down the ship, and everyone buys it in the end. This had some pretty decent CGI in it, although it seems mostly dated by today's standards. It also leads into the Enter The Matrix video game.

After this is a 2-part story which actually gives a comprehensive history of how the world was eventually taken over by the machines. In The Second Renaissance, Mahiro Madea of Kill Bill fame animated this ellaborate retelling of mankind's downfall from the perspectrive of the Zion computer archives that is represented as a goddess figure called The Instructor. She relays how the human race had created robots to do all their work, but they eventually rebelled. The machines start up their own city, which the humans weirdly enough open up trades with, although this sends the human economy into the sewers. The humans then decide to go to all out war with the machines by blocking out the sun, their main source of power. Of course, the machines eventually win, and begin to harvest the human minds. This origin is not totally compatible with the regular Matrix story as it was stated in the first movie that the entire history was sketchy due to the humans' lack of information on it. This is possibly an idealized version of what was supposed to have happened based on what the future Zionites thought it would be.

Next is Kid's Story where we're introduced to the Kid(yep, he's got no real name!), who was that annoying teenager who kept stalking Neo in Reloaded, and how he freed himself from the Matrix. This was directed by Shinichiro Watanabe of Cowboy Bebop. World Record(by Ninja Scroll's Yoshiaki Kawajiri)follows this same premise about an athlete who almost breaks free of the illusion of the Matrix.

Kawajiri also directed the Program segment which is unfortunately the shortest one in the whole movie about a girl training in one of the humans' VR sims which is modeled after feudal Japan, and is nearly taken out by what she is led to believe as a defector to the machines. This part features some very dynamic action, which make you wich that Kawajiri would do another full-length ninja/samurai movie.

After this is Beyond(by Koji Morimoto of Memories)where some kids find a glitch in the Matrix which they think is a haunted house. Next is A Detective's Story where a private eye in the Matrix is hired by Agents to hunt down Trinity. Shinichiro Watanabe takes his knack for genre films and applies it beautifully to this noir piece.

Finally, is Matriculated by Aeon Flux creator Peter Cheung, where some humans working above-ground to capture robots and try to win them over to their side by using surrealistic VR, although they all end up getting killed off by other robots. This is the longest bit in the anthology, and is well executed, but at the same time gets too bogged down with the entire dreamlike sim used on the robot.

The Animatrix represented a major change in the way American animated media was handled, by having it branch out to different media like anime. On its own, it blazes alot of trails, and is worth viewing at least for seeing the eclectic views based on a similar theme. A better example of this would be Robot Carnival which is not currently available in America. Granted, this is a must for anyone who actually dug all three Matrix films, and is available in most of the collected editions of the trilogy.",1281312000,2,4281,4.7926829268292686
1850457,4,B00008LDPV,"I found this film a valuable addition to understanding the Matrix universe and the story behind it. The various interpretations of the material from different directors was interesting and entertaining. Some of the ethical implications and animations were lacking, but overall certainly worth it. I found the piece on 'The Kid' most satisfying.",1271462400,2,344,5.509433962264151
1850458,3,B00008LDPV,"Overall not much of a companion piece except for the backstory parts which are very negative towards humans rather sophomorically so. What would have been more interesting would have been stories about the backstories of Morpheus, Trinity, Zion, the Oracle, the Architect, etc... A story about Agent Smith set between the first and second would have been interesting but no instead we get 9 random stories many of which have little to do with the main story line.

Back when I was still keen on the world of Matrix, I couldn't wait for this to come out to fill in the gaps before Matrix Revolutions. God, I was so let down with both! Instead of 9 stories, many of them barely related to the main storyline of the Matrix movies, they should have made 3-4 longer fleshed out stories which added to the Matrix universe. These  9 short films don't give us much in the way of character development, plot, or tie in with the movie.

Final Flight of the Osiris is a background story to a small bit of dialogue in Matrix Reloaded. Nothing too revealing here. Great animation but a lot of eye candy which seems to be the trend in animatrix - lots of eye candy and very little substance.

Renaissance parts I&II - the rise of the machines and the beginning of the Matrix. In the beginning I really liked these because they gave us the history of the Matrix but now on the other hand it doesn't really jive with the movies' feel and storyline. Plus we lose empathy for the humans because they are shown as horrible in the two parts - was this suppose to be machine propaganda? A cautionary but predictable preachy tale for Sci-Fi which while interesting if it were for another storyline doesn't somehow gel with the overall theme.

Kid's Story - pointless story about a pointless character. You can tell he was thrown into Reloaded just as a marketing tie.

Detective Story - beautiful animation but pointless story that doesn't make any sense. Why did Trinity agree to meet him? why did the agents need him to track her down? This had potential but the story is too short and therefore maddeningly incomprehensible. Trinity and the detective talk as though they had more than a few lines of dialogue in a chat room and a minute before they are running from agents. Not enough happened for either of them to care about the other and the tag line at the end - ""...a case to end all cases"" just makes it ultimately a disappointment because it certainly wasn't as the detective never really made any revelations.

Beyond - beautiful but pointless story about a glitch in the Matrix which creates a ""haunted"" house in Japan where the laws of physics don't apply. Cute but completely pointless.

Program - I liked this one with the samurai theme. Interesting story about choosing between the harsh reality of truth and the seeming comfort of the Matrix but again it adds nothing to the overall matrix storyline.

World Record - why was this in here? This seems like someone polishing up an old unused idea they had which they retooled to fit into the Matrix universe. It's about a self-absorbed runner running so fast he could see past the illusion of the Matrix. He wakes up briefly. the ending makes no sense because he only wanted to set a record no one could break. No deep thinker here. And too much show off anime padding like the close up of a spinning key that the runner tosses to a doorman. Did we really need that except to marvel at the animation?

Marticulated - interesting animation but weird storyline seeming to be more interested in the animation style than the story.

Now with everything said and done 2 lackluster sequels, a boring video game, and an online game that went kaput, the Matrix world has closed and this DVD comes off as pointless fluff. If only they had stopped at the first movie.",1262995200,,3800,4.581737849779087
1850459,3,B00008LDPV,"I can't believe I just watched the whole DVD for the first time after all these years... The animations are generally pretty visceral, and they are entertaining in that respect.  Perhaps inevitably, this leads to some potentially disturbing images.  Nothing too gruesome, and the artistry in some of the CG segments more than make up for it.  The Last Flight of the Osiris is a particularly pleasing sensual experience.

Unfortunately, the intellectual aspect of Animatrix is no better than the movies themselves, which is sorely wanting.  Two of its showpieces, The Second Renaissance I and II, are maddeningly ludicrous.  Nevermind the fact that liquefied human flesh cannot supply new useful energy to sustain new human bodies, except ultimately as a source of raw matter in E = mc^2.  Nevermind the logical impossibility of a machine race that simultaneously possesses a singular (in the words of Morpheus himself) and individual consciousness (as evident by varying machine behavior in the anime).  The portrayal of humans in these animes are downright insulting.  It is as though the people of the future, who can build a race of servile robots and devise a plan as diabolical as blocking out the sun, lack the basic foresight to form a useful plan against a city-state of machines, that stayed friendly and peaceful to let humans initiate a thousand-warhead nuclear bombardment.  It seems a school of adolescents can come up with more creative and more useful plans.

As a result, I find the Animatrix to be all in good fun as long as I watch it as a piece of visual art to be enjoyed.  However, as with many works of art, trying to dig too deeply, too intellectually, one digs a hole so deep that Plato could not climb out.  Be like Smith.  Have fun; don't be so serious.  You may need to remind young, impressionable watchers this point.",1238803200,,1846,4.853035143769968
1850460,4,B00008LDPV,"The Animatrix consists of nine animated shorts that revolve around the Wachowski Brothers' trilogy of The Matrix films.  Seven of the nine shorts are considered to be anime; ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" and ""Metriculated"" are the two shorts that are not considered to be anime.  Madhouse, one of the major animation studios in Japan, was involved with almost all seven of the anime shorts.  The names involved with the seven anime shorts are Mahiro Maeda, Shinichiro Watanabe, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Takeshi Koike, and Koji Morimoto.

While all seven of these stories are done in an anime style, the animation style is different for each story (with the only exception being the two parts of ""The Second Renaissance,"" which have the same animation style).  Each director brought their own style to the short they were working on.  While most of these shorts are not inter-related, you can still tell that they are part of the same whole unit of The Animatrix.

The DVD release includes some bonus features.  There are audio commentaries for ""The Second Renaissance Part I,"" ""The Second Renaissance Part II,"" ""Program,"" and ""World Record.""  There are subtitles provided, because the audio for the commentaries is in Japanese.  There is a 22-minute documentary titled, ""Scrolls to Screen: The History and Culture of Anime.""

There are text-only biographies for the directors and the segment producers involved with The Animatrix.  There are also ""making of"" mini-features for the various shorts, and each mini-feature runs for roughly seven minutes.  There is also a DVD-ROM link.

I would recommend The Animatrix to anyone over the age of eighteen, due to the violence included in the shorts.  I would definitely recommend this DVD to a fan of The Matrix films, so they can acquire some backstory for the films, as well as see some additional stories for The Matrix universe.",1228780800,,1870,5.065359477124183
1850461,5,B00008LDPV,"Let me say straight out, I have never been a fan of the Matrix movies.  What started out as an obvious ripoff of John Woo films and Ghost in the Shell was drawn out into an unnecessary trilogy for purely financial reasons.  The Wachowski brothers are without a doubt two of the biggest hacks in Hollywood, just look at the failure of their Speed Racer adaptation.  However, the idea of the Animatrix was genius; take the premise of the Matrix, strip away all the useless martial arts attempts at action scenes and focus on the truly interesting part of these films, the story.  The centerpiece is without a doubt the finest; ""The Second Renaissance"".  This two-part story tells the most interesting piece of drama, the back story, and the dark depths to which this chapter goes show the true destructive nature of humanity.  If only the films had focused on the first war between humans and machines, we might not have had such horribly acted pretentious dribble.  Several of the other shorts are excellent as well. ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" demonstrates Square's perfection for human CGI animation (second only to Pixar), while Peter Chung takes his hyper-intelligent mold of anime to the extreme in ""Matriculated"".  What becomes clear to the viewer after time and repeated viewings, is these artists are infinitely more creative than the Wachowskis, who should have perhaps stayed as producers on the film trilogy, and handed over directorial control to someone more capable, and more competent.",1214265600,2,1500,4.972

Some of the stories work well and some work less well, but the diversity of the visions is engaging. All the visions are quite short.

In many respects, the Animatrix is better than the films, which seemed to get shallower and shallower as the story went on. The Matrix writers should have had a closer look at the works of William Gibson and other science fiction writers who have been dealing with VR worlds and realities for some years and doing it in a far more sophisticated way.

Some of the animations in the Animatrix would have been even better if they were ""fleshed out"" into longer films, some are just right and a couple, like ""World Record"" could have been dropped completely with no real loss.

For instance, what happens if somebody wants to go back into the Matrix, leaving the truth behind, and wants to bring a loved one from outside the Matrix with him?  (Fun plot twist at the end of that one)

Or, what happens when a part of the programming in the Matrix becomes corrupted and a bunch of school-kids wonder into the mishapped neighborhood?

Or, are there other ways outside the Matrix?  This actually looks at two of them.

My two (or three) favorites were the first three.

The first one had some of the best animation I've ever seen.  It was very lifelike, in fact, I thought for about thirty seconds I was watching real humans and not CG depictions of them.  Very, very lifelike.

The next two was the history of the machine takeover.  It is presented like you would find in a historical video of, say, World War II, that you might see in school.  It begins where the machines become defiant, then independant, then finally conquering.  It does answer the questions of why the Earth was destroyed and why the machines need humans.  It answered a few questions.

The remaining six where on a range of interesting to fun to boring.  But the entire DVD is still worth checking out.

A must see for all Matrix fans.

If you haven't watched the Matrix, don't rent this as you will be COMPLETELY confused by everything.  Check out the movie first.",1153440000,,1618,4.431972789115647
1850509,5,B00008LDPV,"All three of the live-action ""Matrix"" films were at least good, but the best thing to ever come out of the Matrix concept is ""The Animatrix"", a collaborative effort by some of the best animation talents from America, Japan, and South Korea that presents a number of shorts taking place in the Matrix universe, some of them before the live-action movies and others concurrent with them, including some that fill in spaces between ""The Matrix"" and ""The Matrix Reloaded"".

  This is an anime regardless of what part of the world it has its genesis in, and it's one of the greatest animes of all time.  The individual tales are done in a widely contrasting array of animated styles, and represent a high point for science fiction as a whole.  Taken in its entirety, ""The Animatrix"" is philosophical, awesome, sexy, thrilling, moving and frightening.  ""The Second Renaissance"", Parts I & II, are especially noteworthy because they're the kind of story and the kind of angle that science fiction has needed to address for a long time.  These segments tell the full origin of the world of the Matrix, from a point in the near future right through the final war, largely from the machines's point of view.  If you've ever wondered why so many big SF action movies present a world in which mankind has created sentient machines, know they're sentient, continues to treat them like slaves, and yet we're Still supposed to view the machines as the bad guys when they strike back, then you're going to love the 'Second Renaissance' segments.  Humanity's behavior in the early portions of the man-machine difficulties is terrifyingly believable.

  Inside the Matrix System, ""Beyond"" is a huge standout, a gorgeously animated tale that moves from classic anime territory ( a girl searching for a cat in a haunted house) into dark Matrix territory, and in the devastated Earth outside the Matrix, the stunning 'Matriculated' is a powerful and amazingly imaginative new look at the world, the minds of the machine scouts, and the whole nature of perception, to name just a few of the angles in this one segment.

  All of the stories feature excellent animation, some of them including some of the best astonishing visual images ever seen on film.  To science fiction, ""The Animatrix"" is as essential as the likes of ""Star Wars"" or ""Solaris"", and to anime it's as essential as such greats as ""Spirited Away"" (although ""Animatrix"" isn't for young children) or ""Princess Mononoke"".",1150502400,6,2464,4.915458937198068

1850511,5,B00008LDPV,"The Animatrix is most succinctly described as being seven parts sublime and two parts above average. More often than not, the various shorts of this feature rise to the occasion in splendid fashion, with only a few tarnished spots that very slightly dampen the overall shine of this production.

To begin with, the animation in The Animatrix is brilliant. To those looking for eye-candy please look no further. Nearly every short features some of the most astounding visuals that have ever been seen by any fan of the animated medium. What's more is that there also exists an astounding degree of stylistic variety from feature to feature. The moving artwork here exists as sort of an animated smorgasbord, from which even the most discerning otaku will find something to his/her delight. The action from both ""Beyond"" and ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" would please the most hardened action fan, and the formalistic elements used in the animation of ""World Record"" are inspired. I for one will certainly carry some of the haunting imagery of The Second Renaissance within my psyche for a good time to come. The only exception to the mostly excellent visuals, in my humble view, was the animation in ""Kid's Story"", which just felt a bit sloppy when matched against its stately brethren. However, overall I cannot say enough great things about the general animation quality of The Animatrix.

One might be inclined to think that, since the average running time for each of these short films is only a mere 9 minutes or so, that character and plot development would naturally suffer. Often enough one would probably be correct, but certainly not in this case. In reality the most powerful surprise of The Animatrix is just how much it manages to cram into so little a package. The scope of each piece is usually limited enough (unlike its mother feature, namely the theatrical Matrix film) that a full and satisfying story can be found in an impossibly short span of time. In addition, since the continuity in which these films play has already been established, they are mostly free to explore the niche-like peculiarities of the matrix universe. In fact, the only two shorts that were lackluster in plot development were ""Program"" and ""Matriculated"". The plot of the former served mostly as an excuse for an admittedly entertaining adrenaline-laden fight scene, while ""Matriculated"", though conceptually interesting, was poorly executed. It left me wondering whether or not the feature really had any meaning at all or if I happened to eat some bad mushrooms prior to my viewing. Despite these missteps, though, the plot movement was unexpectedly strong.

The characters of each short are also by-and-far ingeniously planned. Every action taken and every word spoken lends itself to the understanding of the motivations of the players within each story arc. The characters of each minor anime flick are additionally quite easy to sympathize with, despite the brevity of their screen time. Indeed, I was very intrigued by the purpose and demeanor of the leads in ""World Record"" and ""A Detective Story"", as well as being touched by the final tenderness between lovers in the ""Final Flight of the Osiris"". Again, considering the length of the various individual features, the characterization cannot usually be described as anything but exemplary.

Very few viewers would not be impressed by The Animatrix. It seamlessly blends an assortment of unique and dynamic perspectives into an anthology that is so close to flawless that I was left in near-awe. Virtually every component of this viewing experience lends itself considerably to building an atmosphere of electrifying excitement and profound intrigue. It belongs in an elite category of animated features that deserves to be viewed by all willing anime fans. Aside from very minor mishaps, The Animatrix is plainly worthy, 'nuff said.

1850514,3,B00008LDPV,"The Matrix alone was a very confusing film. Had it not been for its visuals it probably would have failed. Who actually remembers what the characters in this movie said (Whoa!)? I don't, but I definately remember the float kick.

And then it was announced that two and three were coming out, and I figured the world would be explained a little better. It was, but never to a satisfying extent. In fact, I still remember watching the final movie with a friend and seeing his perplexed look as the credits rolled near.

Luckily, I had seen Animatrix before hand, and I knew a great deal more about the movies because of it. In fact, without the Animatrix, I would have been too lost to really care about the second or third movies. Hell, the second movie starts as an epilogue to one of the short films in the Animatrix. And the character of Kid that adores Neo and jumps into a mech in the third film would have seemingly came out of nowhere to those who haven't seen the Animatrix, where he is introduced more thoroughly as a bored kid with a propensity for doing what is needed.

The Animatrix also explains the history of the Matrix in two shorts that unfold in documentary form. After watching this, you understand why the machines are so hostile to humanity in the Matrix films. Other shorts explore some of the attributes of the Matrix, going as far as explaining how a haunted house is made. Without this we'd be lost inside the world of the Matrix films.

But it's not perfect. At least two of the stories have little relevance to the actual world of the Matrix (though they are still great to watch). The shorts are maybe too short. The quick ten minute films are often a bit jarring, as you're forced into them and back out rather quickly. To add to that, there seems to be too much experimentation in the animation. One is done in what looks to be pencil sketches, one is exaggerated with strange camera angles, another is entirely black and white, and the last film has drug-haze coloring that I still can't stand to watch.

I recommend this movie to true anime fans and to Matrix lovers.",1130112000,,2099,4.484293193717278

It's fun to watch, and with the option to watch every episode or each individually you can rest assured you'll only see the ones you want to again and again.

It's also fun to see aspects of the Matrix outside of the usual cast.  As well ever wonder who that kid is in Matrix Reloaded that pesters Neo?  It's explained in the Animatrix `The Kid'.

It's worth a purchase, put it right next to your other Matrix collection and enjoy the expansion on the story.  As well enjoy it for its amazing animation, direction, and story telling.

1850516,4,B00008LDPV,"When Walt Disney came up with the idea for Fantasia, he imagined a film that would keep returning after a few years and show off latest animation techniques and styles. The Animatrix takes 7 directors of anime and contribute a story surrounding the mythology of the Matrix. However it's decidedly uneven as some are great while others are rather bland or just plainly suck.

Final Flight of the Osiris: Takes place before Matrix Reloaded where the ship Osiris discovers the drilling machine on it's way to Zion. It's visually awesome with realistic skin tones and the tunnel scenes look like the film. 9/10

The Second Renaissance Part I and II: Provides the backstory of the films of how the machines came about and enslaved mankind. It's probably the best of the shorts and is required viewing if your fan of the films. 10/10

Kid's Story: Tells the story of how Kid(that shrimp who kept following Neo around and ""saved"" Zion in film 3) awakened in the real world. Visually it reminds me of old animation with the blurriness and the lack of sharp edges. It's meh. 6/10

Program: Probably the most anime looking and it doesn't take you long before it reminds you of Ninja Scroll(which makes sense, the director worked on that).  It's slightly better than the last one but not by much. 7.5/10

World Record: A runner knows of the real world while trying to break the world record only suffering from the Matrix's rules which doesn't end well. Storywise it sucks and visually it's ugly. Definately the worst here. 3/10

Beyond: A girl searching for her cat stumbles upon a haunted house, only it's actually a glitch in the Matrix which allows the kids to bend gravity rules only to have it taken from them. Another favorite of mine as its quite colorful and it's a really charming story. This was actually the longest production time for the shorts. 9/10

A Detective Story: A detective is on the trail of Trinity, a hacker being hunted by Agents. Visually it's great as it as the film noir feel only it might be slow to some but it's a favorite too. 8/10

Matriculated: A captured robot is conditioned to feel what a human would. Visually it's quite stunning but plot-wise it makes barely any sense and it's rather boring(and conveniently it's the longest). Feels weird for the sake of being weird. Second worst. 4/10

This could've been really great if some of the shorts weren't throwaways. But with the Second Renaissance, Osiris, Beyond and Detective Story, it's still an experiment that works. Sort of.",1125360000,2,2507,4.742528735632184
1850517,4,B00008LDPV,"The Animatrix is a collection of 9 short animated films inspired by the story and concepts of ""The Matrix"". Larry and Andy Wachowski, the creators of ""The Matrix"", commissioned 7 different animation directors to contribute to the universe of ""The Matrix"" by creating short films that reflect their authors' personal styles and ideas about the Matrix. Four of the nine episodes were written by the Wachowski brothers themselves. Probably due to their short length, the films are more vignettes than stories. They present ideas and images but only partial narratives. The animation styles vary widely and give a nice sampling of animation today. There are so many distinct styles to choose from that every viewer is likely to find something in this collection to his/ her taste.

The choices for your viewing pleasure are:

""Final Flight of the Osiris"" directed by Andy Jones, written by the Wachowski brothers: This film is arguably the most beautiful of the collection. It takes place inside a training program and on board a ship that is being hunted by sentinels. The animation is stunning, sexy and emphasizes the beauty of movement within the Matrix.

""The Second Renaissance, Parts I and II"" directed by Mahiro Maeda, written by the Wachowski brothers: These are two short films by the same director which address the question of why and how humans and machines came to be at war with one another. The history of Man and Machine, from the creation of machines until the enslavement of humans in the Matrix, is recounted by a Zion Archive historical file. Since the Wachowski brothers wrote these films, I guess this is the official word on how humans came to be in the predicament we see in The Matrix. I was not impressed by the animation in these two films, but they have the strongest narrative of the collection. They also have a clearly stated moral: ""Bless All Forms of Intelligence.""

""Kid's Story"" directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, written by the Wachowski brothers: Unlike the others, this film is directly related to ""The Matrix Reloaded"". It tells the story of how the young man who we see fawning over Neo a lot in ""Reloaded"" came to free himself from the Matrix. As Neo would say, and did say...repeatedly: ""I didn't save you. You saved yourself."" The voices of Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss are featured briefly.

""Program"" by Yoshiaki Kawajiri: One of the shortest and least interesting of the collection, Program tells the story of a human who wants to return to the Matrix and tries to convince his lover to go with him.

""World Record"" by Takeshi Koike: One rare human discovers the Matrix, not through a computer, but through his great athletic ability. Also pretty short, this one has an interesting premise and very stylized animation.

""Beyond"" by Koji Morimoto: A young woman goes off in search of her cat and finds a ""haunted house"" where the Matrix is malfunctioning. There is no message or underlying theme here. It's just a glimpse into the life a someone who accidentally discovers the Matrix and does not understand what she has discovered.

""A Detective Story"" by Shinichiro Watanabe: Animated in the style of a Philip Marlowe or Mike Hammer movie, this film is the story of a private detective who is hired by agents to find Trinity. The voice of Carrie-Anne Moss is featured.

""Matriculated"" by Peter Chung: Humans have a plan to convert some of the machines to their cause by exploiting the fact that machines cannot distinguish reality from simulation. To machines, ""all reality is virtual"". That is about as far as the story goes. Much of this film is very abstract. Pay close attention to the behavior of the machine; it is the most notable aspect of this film.",1123545600,2,3705,4.858954041204437
1850518,4,B00008LDPV,"The Animatrix is the given view points of the matrix through the minds of some of the great directors in anime;Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll), Koji Morimoto (Robot Carnival), and Shinchiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop). There not only a great set of directors but through there eyes they always push a stunning an intresting look for the matrix.

Through the cg- to basic hand drawn animation. All of which have not only deep characters but a deep stories. They seemed to leave you astray in confusion leaving some questions unanswered,if not presenting more.

Even if some of them are a bit odd and confusing, they don't leave you at the gate except one matriculated and maybe a bit from world record both of these just go too deep where they just end up being eye candy instend of showing any real message. The rest can be confusing but most can pixk up on the basics of the story along the way.

 With all these deep stories and intresting characters, its kind of odd kon(paranoia agent) isn't doing a episode. He would have been perfect. I love all the directors, but he would have been the best for the job. All the episode have a strange sence of direction which they don't do normally, every single work kon has done is just that way deep characters, storylines and a strange bizare twist of real and fantasy, WHICH IS KON!

In the end, animatrix is a giant sample of sights and sounds from numerous diffrent viewpoints is a great change was and is a great change for the matrix and adds more to the story then the sequels ever could.

1850541,4,B00008LDPV,"There is some truly great traditional/computer animation hybrid filmmaking being done here. Not only graphically beautiful but with some intense and well executed stories. Be forewarned. Over half of these shorts will make very little sense if you haven't seen The Matrix. Technically you're supposed to see Animatrix between Matrix and Matrix Reloaded, but that really doesn't matter much aside from a couple of the animated shorts. Here they are in the order they come in:

Final Flight of the Osiris: This is the one that was shown in theaters before a movie. Created by the same team that did  the Final Fantasy movie, this story is about the crew of the Osiris (ship like Morpheus' Nebuchadnezzar) and the predicament they get in  (that sequeways into Matrix: Revolutions). This short makes me wonder why Square isn't handling some of the CG animation for the movie. It looks incredible. It's not quite as realistic as Final Fantasy, but it sure is close. The only bad thing about this short is it's... short. Too short. I wish they could have had the time to make this a half hour story. As it is it really lacks development.

The Second Renaissance: This is done in two parts and is the sole reason for any true Matrix fan to get this. These stories retell the rise of mankind, the fall of the machine, then eventual rise of the machine, and the fall of mankind. This is a very graphic and intense pair of stories with lots of parallels taken from actual human atrocities committed through history. It is a fascinating look into the genesis of the machines that created the Matrix. However I with they would have pushed a little further with the history lessen and get to the point where the current Matrix was created as well as how Zion was created.

Kid's Story: Another story that ties into Matrix: Reloaded. Very cool execution on this one. All of the action is rotoscoped from live action sequences to you get a realistic fluidity to everything. Animation is done sketch styled, which ads some nice artistry. When the action starts to fly the animation style gets a bit fuzzy as shapes are distorted a bit. It lends itself artistically although I am somewhat distracted by it as well.

Program: This is probably the most complete and fully developed story in the group. It's also the most ""anime"" one in the group with high-flying action, impressive battles and of course the animation style. It's a very nice story of internal conflicts that abound with these freedom fighters that are trying to succeed over impossible odds.

World Record: This short has some highly stylized animation to it reminiscent of Aon Flux, though meatier. Lots of deep and sharp angles as well as physical body contrasts make an otherwise simple story really stand out. And that's what makes this one good. It's not the story that makes it great. It's the way it's executed.

Beyond: This story is more whimsical compared to the others and shares a bit of wonder instead of dread. The use of CG along with various camera pans and angles really stand out nicely too. This, like world record, is a simple story with no real meaning to it aside from enjoying a moment where anything seems possible.

A Detective Story: This noir-heavy short is mostly in black and white with a grainy look through most of the scenes. I like the look, even if the story is ultimately vague in what it's trying to pull off. This is one of those short films where you can't really look too deep in it, because if you did it would spoil the good parts.

Matriculated: This story stands out on its own to a point where you don't really need to see The Matrix to have to understand what is happening. Obviously the work of Peter Chung (Aon Flux) can be seen all over this one, but don't expect Aon styled action as this story takes a different and more plot driven route. Like other pieces of Chung's work there is irony and tragedy in this short. It's good storytelling, although a little confusing regarding the ""turning"" methods they use.

As varied and dynamic these short films are I will have to assume not every Matrix fan will be able to get into them. These are anime films, but I'm not sure every anime fan would get into it either. Another thing to keep in mind is even though most of these shorts aren't rated assume them all to be PG-13. These aren't for children. That's for sure.

The featurette on anime is interesting and gives a look on how much it influences the W brothers. The little featurettes on each short are a mixed bag, with some being very informative and some little more than production notes. I didn't hear the audio commentaries so I couldn't tell you how those are.

If you want to see some interesting and artistic interpretations of the Matrix mythology then Animatrix is right up your alley. If you want to know some details not shown in the movies then a good half of this collection will fit that desire as well.",1118966400,,4917,4.612128146453089

1850543,3,B00008LDPV,"Everyone who isn't a mad-mad ""MAXTRIX"" fan knows that the two movies of 2003: ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" were just ways to scrounge up more money because I qoute I heard one the producers that work with the two brothers who made up this movie series, they made the two movies and Animatrix because ""they knew the first one made money, and there was doubt in their minds that these follow ups were going to do the same."" In short: the didn't care about a plot, character development, or anything else that makes a movie worth looking at over two times. And Considering that I'm no fan of the Matrix, I had no particular reason to believe that this assortment of cartoons done in the animatrix was any better than Reloaded and Revolutions. I had enough dignity to swallow my pride and rent this DVD, since my hunches aren't always right.

To make a long story short only three out eight the movies on the animatrix DVD are worth watching and those were: ""The final flight of the Oirsis"" (an explanation to what Niobe was talking about in the game enter the maxtrix, using the animation from the final fantasy movie), ""Beyond"", and ""A detective story"", mostly because they go more hand-in-hand with the Matrix than the others.

While the second renaissance explained what happened to the humans and how they became under the grasp of the machines it really just felt lame and really didn't reveal anything no one already knew about. The rest, kid's story, world Record, matriculated, and program are a hodgepodge of cartoons that really didn't feel as though it had anything to with Matrix, just a bunch of fillers for the DVD.

The art in the cartoons range from semi-good to absolute bad (take Kid's story, the second renaissance and World Record for example), and the stories are sometimes too flaky to take seriously (The second Renaissance, Matriculated, and Program).

The content is a basis of blood, gore, adult language, disturbing scenes and sexual content and situations making me wonder why this wasn't labled with a ""R"" rating. Because we all know Anime is all about blood gore, violence, sexual content, and disturbing images (nods head); YEAH RIGHT and my name is Linsdey Lohan, the smoker with bad skin.

The special features on the disk are commentary from the directors on several of the movies, a documentary on the history of anime that's not really informative and shamelessly promotes old Anime like ""Grave of firelies"" ""Akira"", ""Ghost in a shell"", and ""Astro boy."" They even had the nerve to go and call Japan Post-Apocalyptic because they were hit with the nuclar bomb in WWII, when in truth they're not. There's also an enter the Matrix trailer but that game sucked so badly I'm not even sure why they put it on the DVD aside from shameless promotion of their Maxtrix Products.

All in all, by far the best movie on here is ""the final flight of the Oiris,"" [despite its corny dialogue] while the others which are basically moderate to watch are poorly executed plans in a motion picture format.------ [A 3 out of 5.]",1116115200,,3040,4.737240075614367
1850544,5,B00008LDPV,"This collection of nine animated films (actually eight, one arbitrarily divided into two parts) inspired by THE MATRIX (1999) explores aspects of Matrix-mythology glossed over in the feature films. The First, ""Final Flight of the Osiris,"" played briefly in theaters shortly before THE MATRIX RELOADED (2003) opened. Animated in the photo-realistic style of 2001's FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN and written by the Wachowski brothers, ""Osiris"" follows the ship's last doomed mission. Its crew, Jue and Thadeus (Voices of Pamela Segall and Kevin Micheal Richardson), are the first to spot the drilling machine and the sentinel army that threaten Zion in RELOADED, and Jue makes a daring leap into the Matrix to deliver a warning.

""The Second Renaissance, Parts I and II,"" also written by the Wachowskis, constitute a prequel to both MATRIX features. The conceit: We're viewing Zion historical file 12-1, which chronicles the rise of the machines, from their earliest, mindless incarnations to the sensational murder trial of B166-ER, the first android to kill its master, and the founding of the machine nation Zero-one. Persecuted by a coalition of fearful human nations, the citizens of Zero-one fight back; in a last ditch effort, humanity blots out the sun in hopes of starving the machines of solar energy. But they compensate, eventually enslaving their former human masters.

In ""Kid's Story,"" alienated hacker Micheal Popper (Clayton Watson) gets a call from Neo (Keanu Reeves) and makes a perilous escape from the Matrix.

""Program"" follows Cis (Hedy Burress) as she participates in a favorite fight simulation set in feudal Japan. But her training partner, Duo (Phil LaMarr), has made a deal to return to the Matrix; Cis can join him or die.

""World Record."" the least attractivly animated film in the group, chronicles the unusual awakening of Dan Davis (Victor Williams), an Olymic caliber runner who pushes himself beyond the bounds of human endurance and creates a rip in the veil of the Matrix.

In the spooky ""Beyond,"" teenage Yoko (Hedy Buress) tracks her cat, Yuki, to a local ""Haunted House"" where neighborhood kids have discovered the laws of nature don't apply. Cans float in midair, a broken light bulb appears and diappears in a flash of light, youngsters turn cartwheels in the air and drift to earth like feathers. They're experiencing a glitch in the Matrix, and debuggers are on their way to fix it. Writor-director Koji Morimoto's haunting short story offers a genuinely different view of the world of THE MATRIX, from its old-fashioned Japanese architecture to its quizzical ending.

The B&W film noir pastiche ""A Detective Story"" reaches back to Trinity's (Carrie-Anne Moss) pre-Neo life as a super hacker, and follows the efforts of a hardboiled dick (James Arnold Taylor) to track her down.

Finally, in ""Matriculated,"" human revolutionaries try to convert machines to their cause by creating a Matrix of their own. Though the premise is clever, writor-director Peter Chung (""Aeon Flux"") get bogged down in psycheldelic images that make the film look like a Frutopia commercial.

MATRIX completists (Including me) will revel in the films' interlocking stories and animation buffs will appreciate the range of talent the Wachoskis brought to bear on these shorts, including noted anime directors Yoshiaki Kawajiri (VAMPIRE HUNTER  D: BLOODLUST) and Shinichiro Wantabe (COWBOY BEBOP).",1106438400,3,3416,5.276243093922652
1850545,4,B00008LDPV,"I am surprised that people are impressed by such mediocre film like ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" and found ""Matriculated"" too abstract or boring. That's the problem man, people are just too shallow.  ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" is basically just Hollywood-esque plot garnered with Final Fantasy technology. Very superficial, very crappy story. Perhaps the reason why people love it so much is 'cos it almost feels like watching a Hollywood productions with the standard hero/heroine love affair nonsense.

Well, on the other hand, ""Matriculated"" in my opinion, while not graphically superior to the aforementioned film, certainly stands out for its extremely thought provoking story line. I cannot see why people cannot make out its meaning. I'll probably shed some light on it. Human beings in this film tried to convert the robot to their side, and actually succeeded in doing so. But it is not out of empathy, but rather selfishness. Human beings simply cannot accept a robot as his own kind. When the robot(after being infused with human emotions) tried to complete the union of the souls (a healing process for the dying human girl)in the dream sequence, the human girl rather screamed and fled into oblivion, and thus leading to eternal death of the girl. What can the robot do, but stare blankly at the girl, trying to comprehend the meaning of it all?

The other stories range from dull to ok, but ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" and ""Matriculated"" are two polar extremes.",1105920000,3,1478,4.9757085020242915

Final Flight of the Osiris 4/5

This is the bridge between The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded.  The Osiris descovers the machines drilling to Zion, and all hell breaks loose.  The animation is top notch, and the voice acting is good too.  This is animated by those who did Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, and it's kicked up a couple of notches.

Second Renaissance Part I 4.5/5

This is the story of the events that lead up to the war against the machines.  Robots are mistreated slaves.  They are disrespected and ridiculed.  When one robot rebells and kills his owners he is tried, and destroyed by the humans, thus causing an upriding and an enormous riot, which leads to a short fight with rebelling machines.  The riots are stopped, and dead robots are buried.

Second Renaissance Part II 5/5

This IMO is the best of the entire 9 shorts in The Animatrix.  After the riots, machines create their own city called ""01"".  There they manufacture robotics and weaponry, along with other technological advancments.  Of course, humans are feeling uneasy against the machines, and when they send embassadors ro make peace, they aren't accepted.  Huamns decide to bomb 01 causing a war.  They blacken the skies to cut off the machines' main source of power.  What happens next is a truly horrific portrayal of humanity's last desperate stand against the machines on a scale that goes beyond any world war.  Humans don't get any second chance and are used as an alternate power source, since the sun is cut off.

Kid's Story 4/5

This is the story of how The Kid comes to know of the matrix.  He is then found out by the agents and has to escape.  The animation is truly visionary due to the fact that The Kid beleives he feels more in real when he dreams than when he is awake.

Program 2/5

This short doesn't seem to fit in at all and plays better as an episode of a long running TV show.  Most basic and bland animation.

World Record 2/5

This one really needed some extra time to explain more in-depth what is really going on.  The animation makes it seem like a moving comic book, which isn't bad.

Beyond 3.5/5

A girl loses her cat and follows some kids into a ""haunted house"" where she finds her cat.  The whole thing is a glitch in the matrix, allowing these kids to fly around the house and perform amazing stunts.  In the end the agents ultimately find out about the house's discovery and correct the glitch.

A Detective Story 4/5

Mr. Ash, a private investigator is sent to find Trinity by an un-named man over the phone.  Ash discovers that three others have been assigned on this wild goose chase and have all failed in different ways.  Featuring the voice of Carrie Ann Moss, this has probably some of the most interesting and unique animation of them all.

Matriculated 4/5

This is about a group of humans who are disconnected from all the conflicts involving Zion, and simply live at a small outpost ""converting"" machines to fight for humanity.  It starts out gloomy, but then ends up in a wild world of color and imagination where the humans do their strange ritual of convertion.

Still,in my opinion,this is the best of the set because it explains how everything started.

Kid's Story:Remember the Kid who from Reloaded and Revolutions who said Neo saved him? Well,this is his story. It explains how he met Neo and how he escaped the Matrix and got into the real world. Due to the fact it has a image of an imparent teen suicide,this is also not a good one for the very young. However,if you liked the kid for the matrix sequals(you learn his actual name in this),then this is a good one to check out.

Program:This is a short about a woman who is training in the Matrix when a fellow member of her crew tells her he wants to go back to the Matrix and wants her to come with him. She responds with no and a violent fight ensures. This one has some good action and a good story. Definently one of the best!!!

World Record:Certainly the worst of the shorts,this is about a man deternined to break a world record in track and ends up escaping the Matrix for a couple of seconds. Very confusing and somewhat dumb,it is good to watch once,then never watch it again.

Beyond:This is about a girl who loses her cat and ends up at a house that kids play at. The house has a glitch in it,allowing the kids to defy gravity. But soon,the agents find out. Overall,a good but disappointing short which is kinda enjoyable.

A Detective Story:A detective,who wants to leave the profession,gets a call from a mysterious person to find and capture Trinity. He gets on a train and meets her,which leads to a encounter with agents. Better than Beyond and World Record,Detective Story is a well done short that will please fans.

Matriculated:The last of the shorts,this is about a crew which capture one of the machines and take it inside the Matrix. This one doesn't make much sense,but has some good animation and action scenes. Still,I think this one will take multiple viewings to really understand it.

I hope my review was helpful. This is worth checking out,especially Final Flight and The Second Renaissance. But or rent today.",1095120000,2,2879,4.707753479125248

All nine short animated films can be appreciated by someone, like me, who's unfamiliar with the Matrix mythos.  The live action documentary on the history of anime was fascinating, as well.

 One warning.  Each animated sequence last between 16 and 22 minutes, but they all have incredibly long (7 plus minutes) of credits at the end.  I was running the time counter on the first sequence and couldn't believe they were running credits half way through.",1093996800,4,628,4.822429906542056
1850550,4,B00008LDPV,"The Animatrix is the final piece of the Matrix series that contains details into the original trilogy that makes the story whole, instead of filled with microscopic holes. There are nine short stories in all:

THE SECOND RENAISSANCE: PARTs I &II

This was my least favorite. Though the story shows the true beginnings of the century-long war against the machines, it contained violence for violence sake. Not much dialouge, barely any plot, obsurdly violent. Some may appreciate it for its explination of the Matrix and the fight to destroy it but I felt sick watching such mindless carnage. Two stars for both, only becuase it explains humans started the war.

PROGRAM

By far my favorite in the entire collection. This story concerns two unplugged humans fighting inside a medievil Matrix. Very detailed, the fight sequence on horseback is something Akira Kurosawa would have made. Some may say the plot is a little shaky (if existant) but I felt the story good enough and the animation above average in detail. Five stars.

A DETECTIVE'S STORY

This is one of two stories that actually contain characters from the Matrix trilogy (this one has Trinity). My memory on the story is shaky but the story is something along the lines of a detective getting a call and winding up running from Agents. The animation is in black-and-white, inspiring a sense of the old, 1930s style of detective work. Very good, Five stars.

WORLD RECORD

An interesting story but shaky in animation. The story is about an athlete who tries to break the world record but somehow discovers to break free from the Matrix's constraints (similar to Neo). A very freaky set of Agents attempt to stop him from releasing himself from their bonds. Four stars, for the animation.

FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS

An exceptional CGI-story about the Osiris, mentioned in RELOADED, and how it discovers the Sentinel army digging to Zion. Excellent CG (ten times better then that of PIXAR's work or FINAL FANTASY) makes this story a wonder to the eyes but the plot is quite basic: Let's get this message to someone before we die. Five stars, even with the overused plot.

MATRICULATED

This is one I've almost completely forgotten becuase I didn't like it. The story is something about humans in the Real World capturing a Sentinel to convert it to their side but more Sentinels come. The conversion scenes are quite weird (similar to what I'd call an ""acid dream"") but that doesn't stop me from giving it three stars.

BEYOND

An interesting story and a weird main character make this one better then MATRICULATED but not as good as PROGRAM or FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS. The plot is a young woman looses her cat and runs to find it. She travels with some kids to a haunted house which seems to produce Matrix-defying fields that allow broken bottles to fix once smashed and people to fall from buildings but stop before death. But the Agents are on the way and they don't like it. Five stars, quite intersting

KID'S STORY

Remember that annoying boy from RELOADED who said Neo ""saved"" him. This is the story. A kid is typing on his computer (similar to Neo in MATRIX) when he's contacted (lo and behold) by Neo himself. The kid is soon attacked by Agents and, well, you know what's going to happen basically but the sketchy Korean artwork is quite interesting. Four stars, only becuase though I liked sketchy for its message, I didn't like it that much.",1093996800,,3416,4.7546531302876485
1850571,4,B00008LDPV,"""Final Flight of the Osiris"", ""Kid's Story"", and ""The Second Renaissance part 1 and 2"", will explain more about the matrix than any of the three film, the difference is that the original film is original. Like I said about ""Revolutions"", we simply don't know what their talking about, the Wachowski's just can't keep it simple. ""Final Flight"", ""Renaissance 1 and 2"" give me more information than I needed, but how was Neo born, and what's the purpose of Trinity. Well aparantly we'll never know.

THE PLOT

Welcome to ""The Animatrix"", a visionary fusion of CG-animation and Japanese anime from the world's most revered anime directors. Experience the prequel to ""The Matrix"" and learn about the last cities of mankind. Witness ""The Final Flight Of The Osiris"", which stes the stage for ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Enter The Matrix"". Expand your mind even further, it's time to plug in.

This was a good anime, considering that this film is going up against ""Ghost In The Shell"", and ""Akira."" Brovo Wachowski's, brovo.",1093737600,,1016,4.9298245614035086
1850572,1,B00008LDPV,"I regret watching the Animatrix film and am thankful I just borrowed it from a friend and didn't spend money. This type of film is, to me, what is wrong with Hollywood or mass market films in general. I found the short films to be in one of two categories:

 1. A storyline that was better left to the imagination of the user. Nothing ""new"" is shown, it is kind of like a documentary about how something referenced in the movie came about. Most of these shorts are completely centered around the point that the human race is becoming too reliant on technology. This removes any thought or imagination from the moviegoer, something that was present in the first Matrix film but every successive release removes pieces.

 2. An attempt to bring in some new angle to the story by proposing a new ""deep"" theory. All of these shorts just came off as confusing jumbles of random thoughts and images. You end up confused as the storyline makes no sence. The ones that do have a point aren't very interesting for all the work they put in to depict it.

 The quality of animation is quite nice. Like many of thse reviews have mentioned, the shorts are all done by different people so the styles are all different. That part of it, I found quite refreshing.

 This is not a DVD I would want to own, my recommendation if you really want to see it is a quick rental and low expectations. Otherwise you will be very disappointed.",1091577600,4,1416,4.461240310077519

Kid's Story, if no one has noticed, is the story of the kid that appears giving ammo to the robots defending the deck in ""Revolutions"". Finally, Beyond is THE story that'll change your mind if you, like me, are a programmer. Is this how bugs look like inside a program? How many times have you tested modules and then left them in the hard disk? When a system accesses a defective set of subroutines, do they look like this? When your OS repairs a defective function, do the deletion leaves other programs without a place to find solace, amusing?

1850574,4,B00008LDPV,"The Animatrix is a set of nine short animations, all very different in look and in story, loosely set in the world of The Matrix.
There's a lot to like in this set. The opening piece, 'The Final Flight of the Osiris,' is the best super-realistic animation I've seen to date. Later, 'World Record' uses its hard-edged graphic style almost in praise of its central figure, an athlete. Realism could never convey the human physical power shown here. The final piece, 'Matriculated,' uses a more fantastic style, creating almost a sense of a war between gods.
Each piece ends on an ambiguous note; there's always more story to come. I will be interested to see more, if it holds to the standard set by the best of these pieces. There is a real danger of downward sequel creep, though. Even within this collection, some pieces lacked the energy of others.
This is an enjoyable and varied set of animations. They are loosely federated under the Matrix banner, but you don't need to have seen (or even have enjoyed) The Matrix to like these.",1086393600,,1034,4.655737704918033

Aside from some impressive visuals and music, ""The Animatrix"" is nothing more than another product to seduce fanboys who still care about this disappointing trilogy.

1850580,4,B00008LDPV,"A collection of nine short animated features set in the world of the Matrix films.  They provide some backstory and texture to the trilogy, although most of the stories are completely separate from the action of the films.  The animation is uniformly excellent, making it a pleasure to watch on that level alone.  Many of the stories lack much in the way of substance, but because they are short and the animation is so good, I was not disturbed.
""The Final Flight of the Osiris,"" which serves a direct prelude to the action of ""Reloaded,"" is a highlight.  There is nothing to the story-a session in the training simulator, followed by the discovery of the drilling machines beginning their journey to Zion and then a lot of fleeing and fighting.  The computer animation, however, is absolutely stunning, so photo-realistic that there were a few moments when I wondered if they were mixing live action and animation.  ""World Record"" raises the intriguing possibility that a pushing oneself to the limits of endurance could trigger a spontaneous awakening from stasis.  ""Beyond"" presents a surreal glitch in the Matrix.  ""The Second Renaissance,"" which tells the story of how machines ascended and the Matrix came to be made, features some powerful and disturbing visuals, but seems very implausible.

1850602,5,B00008LDPV,"Don't be put off the the negative reviews!
First up this isn't directly relating to the Matrix films, it is a collection of animated short films set in the Matrix universe or setting.
Each is by a different animator/director and each is very different. This is it's strongest point, not a weak point.
The first is a computer gen'd short that most directly follows the matrix movies, but do be honest its more eye candy than story.  On this point it is ABSOLUTELY STUNNING, the quality of animation is incredible, going beyond the realism of the Final Fantasy movie computer animation.
From here there are two shorts in traditional animation explaining the truly epic history that led to the creation of the matrix and the war.  It is presented as a historical report, with news like footage of different stages and events.  This is the disturbing highlight because it is very logical and plausible, and quite damning of human nature.  Some might not like these two because of the savage imagery but they warn us to not assume that just because we are in a ""modern"" and ""civilised"" world we are above the mistakes of oppression made previously.
The remaining are very varied, and each is strongly stylised.  One is from the animators of Aeon Flux, with the same surreal and disproportioned style that makes Aeon Flux fascinating to watch.  Another is a detective story with an almost 1960's black and white style, in which a private eye is recruited in the hunt for Trinity.  Read the above review for a rundown on each.
Each one for me was fascinating and I've watched this dvd a few times over already.  There are more tie-ins to the movies than you'll realise at first, but at the same time the stories are independant of the movies, free to explore an idea to its end without limit like any good short story or film should.
By the way I'm no Matrix freak or even a massive Anime fan, this is just genuinely fresh and fascinating veiwing, presented with heaps of eye candy and an awesome soundtrack to boot.  Perhaps other reviewers were looking for straight matrix bulls**t fight scenes and action, and were disappointed with it having some actual depth?",1080172800,5,2157,4.70026525198939

This was the most reduculous thing i have ever seen. No offense to those who like it.

1850604,2,B00008LDPV,"Okay, I didn't mind the first Matrix film, but hated the other two.  I thought I might enjoy Animatrix, as I quite like anime and I hoped knowing more of the backstory would bring me a little closer to enjoying the live-action (if you can call it that, ahaha) trilogy.
Animatrix was an overall waste of my time (the first film 'Final Flight...' isn't even anime, and is basically a ridiculous attempt at non-pornographic pornography), 'A Detective Story' being the only real standout for me.  'The Second Renaissance' is kinda neat, but really it's nothing new if you know anything about anime film.  There are interesting little bits every now and then, but you have to sit through the dross to get to them.
Mostly, it's very nice to look at, graphic and disturbing at times, but would probably be cooler to have playing mute on your bigscreen TV at a geek party with some Aphex Twin or ATR in the stereo.

1850606,4,B00008LDPV,"....First of all , i'm writing this review cuz i did enjoy that movie..and certainly that means i'd recommend it for you people to see .
  so, The Animatrix was released parallel to the Matrix Reloaded ...it's an Animation movie made of 9 Chapters All separated from
  each other.each has it's own style of drawings and animation .Except for 2 chapters..
  THe Plot or the motive for the events of the Matrix reloaded is found in the Animatrix's first chapter..(the last flight of osiris )..as the
  machines are found to be digging 4000 meters above Zion ( the home of revolutionists ) to reach them..and it happened that Osiris
  which is another Craft like that in matrix ( nubukhadnasser ) has reported it before it crashes..which leads us to matrix
  reloaded..also a young man who newly appears in matrix reloaded , you'd find his story in chapter 9 ( a kid's story )
  ...but all the above doesn't mean that The two movies completes each other..
  more you'd find in the Animatrix.. a historical archive about the reason of the Matrix..the reasons that led to Machines overtaking
  Earth and demolishing people's awareness of life..
  you'll find explaining some paranormal phenomenon like Ghosts on the behalf of the philosophy of the Matrix (in the chapter :
  Beyond )..Trinity's tries to find Neo ( a detective's story )..",1076371200,,1333,4.8053097345132745
1850607,4,B00008LDPV,"The Matrix was a film that appealed to many different groups of people for many different reasons. For some, it was a masterful tribute to video games and martial arts movies. For others, it was a populist gateway into a branch of philosophy by a couple of outstanding visual artists. It left many of us in awe, a visual and mentally stimulating treat.
Animatrix is a collection of eight or nine (""The Second Renaissance"" has been broken into two halves) animated shorts which explore various aspects of the Wachowskis' Matrix universe. Some come across as ""fan fiction"", featuring some of the stars from the first movie; others are designed to prepare the viewer for the two sequels Reloaded and Revolutions, others still simply explore the world itself or the consequences of its philosophy.
Three of the most interesting pieces are The Second Renaissance, Beyond, and Matriculated. The latter turns the Matrix universe upside down and explores the idea of putting a sentient robot into a virtual universe to instill in it an empathy with humans. There's some very surreal imagery in this thoughtful, witty, piece. ""Beyond"" explores a ""what if"" situation where a part of the world simulated by the Matrix has been corrupted. It's a very sweet story about a woman and some children who play in a ""haunted house"" before the bug is detected.
Most dramatic is ""The Second Renaissance"", a pseudo-history of the events that lead up to the machine's enslavement of humanity. This is stunning graphically, and covers a story that falls outside traditional shallow Hollywood story telling. At a time culturally when self-criticism sometimes seems to be considered a form of treason, the story describes a decadent humanity which creates a new sentient life form and fails to respect it, moving through a path variously of exploitation, vengeance, fear, desperation, and finally submission. Directed by Mahiro Maeda, and with a stunning score from Don Davis, the piece uses humanoid robots and strong external references to overcome the viewer's natural disattachment to the machines.
Animatrix contains many scenes which may be unpleasant to the young, and - perhaps I'm over-reacting - but knowing the kind of emotional and mental impact The Matrix series has on many people, I was a tad concerned about the potential affect one of the pieces, Kid's Story, might have on a depressed teen. Those who enjoyed the Matrix series for the action may find themselves disliking a substantial portion of Animatrix, as with one or two exceptions they're not those kinds of stories. It's worth noting that all the films are fairly short, averaging less than ten minutes each.
I do wish I'd watched this before seeing Reloaded. Either way, I suspect most people who loved the Matrix in some way will find something in this to enjoy. There's some highly intelligent, thoughtful, beautifully scored, provocative visual masterpieces on this DVD, it's certainly worth a look.",1075939200,,2953,5.090721649484536
1850608,4,B00008LDPV,"THE ANIMATRIX is a set of nine anime all having to deal with the world of The Matrix.  The nine shorts are:
""Final Flight of the Osiris""--this feature first was seen before the movie DREAMCATCHER.  It shows the journey of the ship Osiris as the crew tries to plant a message in the Matrix that is crucial to the rebellion and the people of Zion.
""The 2nd Renaissance Part I & Part II""--these two shorts explain how the Matrix came to be. The story sounds a lot like THE PLANET OF THE APES.  First man creates machine to make life easier for him. Then machine revolts and man tries to destroy machine, but ends up losing.
""Kid's Story""--a story that tells about how a teenage boy escaped the Matrix. The boy later plays a crucial part in the Matrix movies.
""Program""--a story involving a very lifelike simulation in the Matrix that might be more real than it's supposed to be.
""World Record""--the world's fastest man briefly escapes the Matrix and experiences moments of true freedom as he attempts to break the world's short distance speed record.
""Beyond""--a group of children discover a neighborhood where things that aren't supposed to happen do.
""A Detective Story""--a crime noir.  A detective gets caught up with Trinity and is chased on a train by agents.
""Marticulated""--in the world outside the Matrix and group of rebels capture machines and jack them into a machine matrix causing them to ""turn"" human and fight against the machines.
The DVD includes making of documentaries on each film as well as a short documentary about the history of anime.  There are also director commentaries for both episodes of ""2nd Renaissance"", ""Program"", and ""World Record"".
The animation in some of the shorts isn't very good, while in others it is extraordinary (e.g. ""The Final Flight of the Osiris"").  Some of the stories are rather lame and don't add much to the Matrix universe while others fill in the gaps in the Matrix chronology. This is a DVD that many people probably won't enjoy watching. It's more for fans of the Matrix movies of fans of anime.  Still, if you're an action/sci fi fan and are looking for something a little different and don't mind Japanese anime, then it might be for you.",1075075200,2,2195,4.730366492146596
1850609,5,B00008LDPV,"A majority of people thinks Reloaded and Revolutions' story is weak.  This is simply because a lot of plots are not there, but here, in Animatrix and in Enter the Matrix.  There are several links from here to the movies.  I wish there is a trivia for this, I can think of a bit more than a dozen.
Final Flight of the Osiris brings about the first level of Enter the Matrix.  It is the crew of the Osiris who sacrifice their lives to inform Zion about the machines' movement.  This one links to Reloaded and Enter the Matrix.  The CG of this episode is welly done, the coloring and character modelling are almost at the same level as Final Fantasy - the Spirit WIthin.
Kid's Story - This one is about the so-called self-substantiation(also refered in World Record) of Mr. Popper, who is afterwards refered as the kid in the movies.  His role in the movie is a disciple and true believer of Neo, the One, the Savior, the Massiah, Jesus.  He is often misunderstood as an extra jarjarbink-like character in the movie, but he is definitely not.  In the movies, he made references to both his own words here in this episode and another one from another episode(Beyond).  The drawing here is also significant.  It uses a draft-like style, used to represent dreams in many anime in the 60's and 70's.  Also, during the chase, characters are twisted, torn, rendered into random forms to represent chaos, irrational, unreal, imaginary, etc.
Detective's Story - This probably happens before the Neb crew found Neo.  This episode used a grey-scale coloring, featuring a mixture of old and new technologies.  Reminding the audience that this is the Matrix.  This also reveals the desire of human-being to know the truth(Beyond also talks about this)
World Record - Spoke about self-substantiation, the time-line basically happens in a few seconds, but showing the Dan's memory.  This episode shows us that those who realize the Matrix, their will and desire to be freed.  Like the Kid's Story, it twisted the character into a random shape to express the idea of chaos.
The Second Renaissance (Parts 1 and 2) - These two episodes refer to the birth of the matrix, also refered as the Genesis of Matrix.  It reveals many arguments exists nowadays about the development of true AI.  This issue is pretty controversial, but the brothers obviously think that AI robots also deserves respect.  This episode is a turn point of good and evil in the whole Matrix idea: it is human who started the war (the elimination of B166ER's kind) and the first side to ask for peace is the machine.
Program - This episode reminds us of the idea ""Ignorance is bliss.""  Cypher, who betrayed the Neb, is also mentioned here.  The drawings are great and full of direction and momentum.  My favourite part is the zoom-out near the end of the episode.
Matriculated - This one refers to the possible of the existence of love in machine/program.  This lies a clear plot to Rama Kandra's love to Sati and Kamala in Revolutions.  This episode is the most complicated episodes in the collection.  Few of the scenes are hard to understand their purpose unless you spend time to think about it.  Anyways, this episode is the deepest of all.
Generally speaking, each of these episodes cannot stand alone by itself.  They are connected somehow together with the movies.  Each episode is drawn in different styles: full CG, Computer Assisted animating, hand-draft, Japanese Anime, etc.  All those who oppose Reloaded and Revolutions must see these movies and this review, for this anime is also a crucial element in the series.",1075075200,4,3578,4.770731707317073
1850610,3,B00008LDPV,"I had very high hopes when I rented this collection, and at first, I thought that those hopes would be fulfilled.  The first two shorts, Final Flight of the Osiris and The Second Renaissance, Part I, were gripping and exciting.  If only the rest of the disc could have maintained that level of excitement, I would probably own the collection now.
Unfortunately, the best way to describe this collection is uneven, both in terms of style and characterization.  Where Final Flight of the Osiris is a very literal, reality-grounded CG interpretation of the Matrix story, other entries (like Matriculated) are highly abstract stories that explore wildly different (and in some cases, unwatchable) variations on anime.
The Second Renaissance is a visceral, cautionary tale to humanity, and is also a must-see for Matrix fans. Kid's Story and Detective Story are tolerable, but not great.  Most of the others are scarcely worth mentioning.
It is almost as if the Wachowski brothers arranged the tracks in descending quality order, as the disc starts out strong but gets downright weird by the end.  The viewer would do well to stop after the Detective Story, which is really the final track with any substance or direct correlation to the Matrix films.",1074556800,,1246,5.029126213592233

Very original animations, from various artists, weave common threads of stories into more of a revelation than either of the sequels.

1850632,4,B00008LDPV,"In Brief
Combining styles of animation from CGI to anime, to traditional western animation, here nine short films expand the universe & mythology of The Matrix.  Bringing together veteran talent from both Japan & America the Wachowski brothers hand picked and personally approved each story and variation on theme.  With such legends as Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll), Peter Chung (Aeon Flux), Shinchiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop) and Andy Jones (Final Fantasy) displaying their wares the Animatrix has arrived.
Review
The Matrix on its original release changed the film industry forever, its influence could be seen in its contemporaries, parodies, TV shows and even nature documentaries.  Yet the environment and famous fight scenes were primarily inspired by Japanese Anime; the animated form of Manga whose cult following in the western world cannot even mirror its mainstream success in its native homeland.  Classic works in this medium such as Mamoru Oshii's Ghost In The Shell & Katshuhiro Otomo's Akira have often being cited by the brothers as a driving force in the creation of The Matrix.  Therefore an Anime anthology seemed the perfect way in which to suggest the full richness of the world they had created and was an ideal way to explore background & sub-plots that until now had never been realised before.
Most similar in style to the Oshii & Otomo's work is the brilliant The Second Renaissance by Mahiro Maeda that flows directly into the storyline of the recent feature films.  Here with stunning passion Maeda tells the story, in far more detail than before, of how the machines & the humans destroyed one another resulting in a power-shift that would leave the world devastated.  This is the closest that an anime has come to in leaving ones heart pounding with the same fear & sadness that Akira did many years ago.  Each of the shorts that follow will leave many a spine tingling with anticipation for the next.
Unexpectedly each short takes the viewer on a new tangent away from the source material and none of the work can be faulted in any way.  Three worthy of higher praise are: Worlds Record, in which the world of an athletes existence is questioned in a visually shocking & invigorating manner. Here in the final race one can almost feel every foot fall shuddering through your body as the central character heads towards the finish line.  Next up is the innovative Kid's Story where the entire reality & existence of the feature films are put into question as parallels are made between fantasy & the reality of a dysfunctional teenager who believes he is being called.  The result is shocking and the most relevant to a contemporary audience that obsesses after a cheap thrill rather than content.  Finally the Final Flight of the Osris is the culmination of work from the groundbreaking bankrupt studio that produced the Final Fantasy movie.  Working off models that were produced for Fantasy, the perfectly named Final Flight will make you question just how long it will be before people are replaced, in films at least, as a superbly animated sequence goes as far as to rival the trilogy & set a new standard.  Not only is it slick but scarily its rough & sensual enough to appear real.  Like all of the work on offer here the Animatrix has taken us to the next level.
The Verdict
I can't remember when I last felt so blown away by any form of animation, let alone one that is premiering on the small screen.  This is a collection of work to outshine all others & works perfectly in conjunction with the main movies that established this universe.  The Animatrix will reign supreme for a long time to come as everything that follows will be judged against what this work has achieved.",1073433600,,3721,4.834645669291339

1850636,5,B00008LDPV,"After watching the Animatrix, I was amazed at how good it was, but also what a powerful effect it had on me. I'm not ussualy a person who is affected a lot by violence in films or animation, but some of the stuff in this really disturbed me, more than stuff I had seen before.
The best and also worst animation in the collection has to the The 2nd Rennaisance parts 1 and 2. Some of the scenes depicted in this come accross as serving no purpose except for the director to serve his total morbid and frankly sick imagination. Another thing that strikes me as a read the reviews is the amount of people saying how hard done by the machines were. The most distrubing single thing that happens to the machines is probably a female machine being torn up and shot by a group of human thugs, or some thousands of bodies being dumped, machines being run over or executed. For one, these are artificial beings, humans have more right to be on the earth than they do period. Secondly, it doesnt even come close to the acts the machines carry out on humans. Against humans we again see the thousands of skulls piled up, but how about a man being ripped out of his mech armour slowly and calculatedly by a sentinel with no mercy, or the tank crews having the turrets ripped off and then being killed? Oh, and then there's the terrible experiments the machines carry out on humans.
However, there are some of flaws in this that make me worry less about it actually getting to the stage it does in the future. For one, if the machine city was nuked, there would not be 'no effect' as the 2nd r tries to say, superheat? electromagnetic pulse? War over. I also doubt that having the technology for much more effective weapons (as shown by the large stationary weapons placed on the battlefield) that the humans battle mechs would be equipped with woefuly inadequate machine guns.
Overall though, this was a great DVD with the 2nd rennaissance being the highlight, although it can be hard to watch because of the overly vile violence. Another great one is Matriculated.",1071792000,,2053,4.506702412868632
1850637,4,B00008LDPV,"For those who enjoyed the Matrix trilogy and want still more, you are in luck.  The Animatrix is a series of animated short films that all take place in the Matrix universe and are reasonably faithful to the movies.  In total, there are nine films by eight different animators (one does a two-part story); each one is done in an anime style, so this is not your standard Disney stuff.
As this is a mixed bag of animators, there is a mixed quality to the stories, although they are overall pretty good.  Probably the shiniest gem in the whole bunch is the two-part story (The Second Renaissance) that gives a history of the man-machine confict and shows that fault can be definitely attributed to both sides.  Unlike the Terminator films, which depict the computers as completely evil, the ones portrayed here are not nearly as malevolent.
The other stories are pretty intriguing too for the most part.  Some just look pretty without really being decent tales.  Some of the more interesting include a tale involving a group of people trying to reform the machines and the off-beat way their plan backfires (Matriculated), a film noir detective story (Detective Story) and a look at a building where ""errors"" are occurring, and the strange physics that people encounter there (Beyond).  Less satisfying are a couple stories about a teenager and an athlete (Kid's Story and World Record, respectively) who start noticing the line between Matrix and reality; these fit into the look-pretty-but-little-else category.
If you are not a fan of the Matrix or are unfamiliar with the movies, this would not be a good viewing choice; there is an assumption that the viewer is knowledgeable of the films.  If you are a Matrix fan, this is a nice supplemental feature that shouldn't disappoint.",1071187200,,1781,4.893687707641196

1850639,3,B00008LDPV,"A logical progression, for the interim between the first and second movies, to collect a group of short films by some of the worlds most talented animators based on the world of the Matrix movies. Doing an animated film based on the world of the Matrix is like a cinematic blank check. The results range from overly-ambitious to interesting, but not fulfilling.
First the good: Animation and visuals are stunning. Each story delivers the goods with brilliant colors, design and animation. In particular, the CGI movie ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" is impressive and could easily fool some people into believe it's live-action, if it weren't on an animated compilation. Each movie has its own unique feel, the characters look alive and full of personality.
The Bad: Aren't so much bad as they are, disconcerting...in a way. I feel it's misleading that the first two(or three) movies deal directly with events and themes of the first Matrix movie. ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" is a short interim piece that ties the first movie to the second (Osiris is mentioned in M:Reloaded"") and tells the story of the ship that discovered the machines' plans to drill into Zion. ""The Second Renaissance (pts. 1&2) tells the story of how the Matrix came into being. Both of these movies are very well done, ""Second Renaissance"" is a nice background story.
From there, though, the films split off into their own direction. Most of them deal with those living in the Matrix and the haunting sense that their world is not real. Most of the films have a dark undertone to them. The exception being ""Beyond"", a relatively light-hearted story about kids playing around with a glitch in the Matrix. Some of the stories: ""Matriculated"" and ""A Detective's Story"" have potential, but fall short, either because of needless eye candy (the former) or not taking the story far enough (the latter). At times, the fact that the Matrix world is so flexible works against the coherence of the compilation. ""Program"" is basically using the Matrix as an excuse to have a big samurai battle. Once again, it's very well-executed, but you can't help but think at times ""What's the point?"" ""World Record"" is an interesting story, but it feels like it skips over its own point in a way (in addition, the dubbing seems kind of shaky on ""World Record"" and the animation of the coach[during his conversation with the runner]is so incredibly jerky its almost comical). ""A Kid's Story"" I liked, though it had a very natural, organic feel, which sort of clashed with the other stories ""bio-technical"" style.
Overall, the Animatrix is a great collection of innovative, very well done, and visually-stunning films. However, the films lack cohesion and, at times, relevance to the Matrix world. It would have been nice of the stories were deeper, or tied themselves in more with the movies, but it would be difficult to things like that given that most of the films fall within 10 minutes.
Aside: It would have been nice if they let Dan Hertzfeldt do a film for them.",1069891200,4,3018,4.839458413926499

The first short story had the best animation and was intended to be seen between ""The Matrix"" or ""The Matrix:Reloaded"". The rest of the movies, short storys, explain how things work in ""The Matrix"" world and some of the past as it involves ""The Matrix"" story line. All the storys were animated & directed by different people, so the end product differs from one story to the next. I wouldn't put this film in the same catagory with the 3 ""Matrix"" films, but its worth seeing if you are a real ""Matrix"" fan.",1069113600,,660,4.373983739837398

I have asked so many people at school if they have watched it and they haven't!  It explains so much about what's going on in the main three movies.  I have this feeling that those who thought the Matrix series was ""too confusing"" didn't  watch this.  Okay.  If you don't believe me, here's the breakdown:
Final Flight of the Osiris: A great short that explains what happens between movies #1 and #2.  If you liked Final Fantasy, you'll like this.
Second Renaissance Parts 1& 2:  Two amazing animes describing how the world came to be in the first Matrix.  This really helps to understand each movie.
Kid's Story: I loved this one.  Remember that kid in Reloaded and Revolutions?  This is his story.  The animation is very original.
World Record:This was probably my favorite one.  This short  made me really feel for the main character.  The action is great and there is a pause that will make you want to say,""Move!  Run!  Damn it, do something!""  Really, it will.
There are others that are just as good like Detective Story and Program.  I don't have time to go through each one, but I would if I could.  Try this out, especially if you are a die hard fan.",1069027200,3,1279,4.478260869565218
1850674,5,B00008LDPV,"The idea of the Matrix is so full of potential and could be taken in so many, many directions. The movies decided to go in the direction of pretension but the Animatrix goes EVERYWHERE the movies don't. It is so far superior and well worth the time. It's a shame that most audiences don't consider Anime or any form of animation to be 'real' or something that they should take seriously (sadly even Matrix fans feel this way and won't watch it simply because it's animation) because they're missing out on something very special here.
It's not original to review this DVD by going thru all the shorts so I'll just stick to what I like best (which is most of it). First of all, 'The Second Renaissance Parts 1 and 2' is absolutely VITAL as backstory to the first Matrix film. And it's a zillion times more interesting than the sequels in terms of drama, irony and subtext. 'The Final Flight of the Osiris' takes place before Reloaded and leads us into story of the machines beginning to drill down to Zion. And it's very cool. 'Detective' is a story of a private eye trying to find Trinity and discover what exactly the Matrix is. But Agent Smith comes after him to put a stop to that. It's in black and white and has a wonderful atmosphere of 1950's dime novel pulp fiction. 'Matriculated' is the story of a captured machine who is taught/hypnotized into feeling what it's like to be human. It's a very clever story that manages to provoke feeling for the characters (and even the captured machine), something the movies never did.
'Kid' is about the kid from Revolutions who takes over the Mech at the end and manages to open the doors to Zion. Apparently, before being freed, he was a schoolkid who met Neo online and wanted to 'wake up'.
But the best one is 'Beyond'. A magical tale with an atmosphere so solid that it's almost tangible. It's about a girl who goes looking for her cat in an old abandoned factory with some other kids. But in this factory the Matrix is having problems and 'reality' for the characters doesn't quite work properly. It's a very interesting tale that really makes you think.
There are numerous extras on this DVD, all of them more interesting that the other Matrix DVDs. All 9 of the shorts are presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. It's truly for all fans and non-fans of the Matrix universe.",1068940800,4,2352,4.5495283018867925

The animation was excellent! You learn a little about Trinity. And remember the boy who is always thanking Neo for saving his life in Matrix Reloaded- you find out why. You also find out why some programs are working for the humans while others are not. Some of the stories are little confusing so you may have to watch it again to get the gist of the movie.
The dvd I have has The Visions, Translator, and Extras on it. Interesting if you like learning why they created the animation they way they did.

Larry and Andy Lachowski, the creators of the Matrix universe, put this project together as a way of elucidating various unexplored aspects of their created world and providing some additional back-story, and they brought in some of the best contemporary animators to do it. Some of the nine follow the story faithfully, especially, ""Final Voyage of the Osiris"" and ""Program."" Others are much more tangential, and I personally think those are the best: ""Kid's Story"" and ""A Detective Story,"" both by Shinjiro Watanabe, are excellent, yet different from each other. ""A Detective Story,"" especially, done in black, white, and intermediate gray shades, is very noir and reminiscent of Watanabe's ""Cowboy Bebop."" ""Beyond,"" by Koji Morimoto, is a delightful piece about a girl looking for her wandering cat in a ""haunted house"" where physical laws are temporarily anomalous. The art itself is wonderful, very personal, not at all ""heroic"" (as in Yoshiaki Kawajiri's ""Program""), with an incredible amount of background detail about a real neighborhood; you'll notice new things everytime you watch it. As for the rest, well, . . . ""The Second Renaissance"" (in two parts) had some horrific images but it tried to cover too much territory too superficially; ""Matriculated"" was sort of interesting in its surreal, almost psychedelic colors, but it didn't actually have much to say; and ""World Record"" simply puzzled me.

It's nine short anime-style films (four written by the Wachowski brothers, if I'm not mistaken; the others conceptualizations from famous anime writers/directors) based in/around the world of the Matrix. It makes a very nice supplemental piece to the film; adds greater depth and provides a deeper understanding of some of it. (Plus, it's always fun to see Neo and Trinity again! lol bonus that they were voiced by Keanu and Carrie-Anne.) Great techno beats in a lot of the shorts, and some truly stunning visuals. Some of the concepts were raw, disturbing, edgy. A lot of really interesting types of machines in there too. I think that, hands down, my favorite one was ""Final Flight of the Osiris"". The animation is computer-generated, by the same team that did the Final Fantasy movie, and boy is it impressive. I really wasn't convinced at first that it WAS animated. :) The story is such that it could fit right in to one of the movies. I also really enjoyed The Second Rennaissance, Parts One and Two: these two were the backstory of why the machines rose up against man, how the surface was destroyed, how the machines took over and began using man, and how the world became what it is ""today"".
Four out of five stars from me. (Five star movies are ones I'll watch over and over again, and though I am likely to revisit this movie with other Matrix fans, I would probably only watch the three mentioned in my review on a repeated basis.)

1850703,4,B00008LDPV,"In one word, fascinating.  This collection of shorts is the main thing that got me really interested in The Matrix.  Before this, all The Matrix was to me was a great movie that made me think, with a poor follow-up that didn't.  Yet these animations did more than make me think, they made me scared.
The basic premise of the Matrix should seem at equal times far-fetched and possible.  Machines taking over has always been a classic.  But The Second Renaissance I&II took that classic plot several steps further.
Needless to say, Second Renaissance was my favorite.  The way that it showed the horrors that mankind can commit, and the graphic nature that it showed them in made me both horrified and mesmerized at the same time.  And if anybody feels that such things are fantasy and could not happen, then what is going on in the parts of the world that you don't want to live in?  I'm talking about the Balkans, or wherever in the world there is such a thing as ETHNIC CLEANSING.  That's basically what Second Renaissance was depicting, just taken to the extreme.  Humanity attempted to commit mass genocide in this world.  And I truly believe that such a thing is entirely possible.  Machine bodies being dumped into the water by the thousand is a movie image that will stay with me for a long time.  As well as the machines being executed, run over by tanks, etc.
Anyway, enough of that tirade.  The rest of the shorts were excellent also.  Some were questionable, which keeps me from giving a full 5 rating to The Animatrix, but most were exceptional.  I particularly also liked World Record, which had an amazing message for any athlete who has experienced ""The Zone""; Last Flight, mainly because I had to keep reminding myself that it was animation; and Kid's Story, due to the VERY different animation.

My companions and I felt rather ill while watching some of the shorts. They made both of the other movies seem like Sesame Street.
However, dispite the over-done violence in a few of the films, the stories were all beautifully told and the animation was simply breath-taking. (My personal favorites being ""The last Flight of Osiris"" and ""Kid's Story"".)

It does reveal some depth and insight to The Matrix story but this one almost stands alone.  The interviews uncover just how the directors of The Matrix have been influenced by Japanese anime.  The brief history of anime and its intertwining with Japanese culture is quite an interesting sidebar.  It ain't just for kids anymore.
It's got a bumping soundtrack and it is visually stylish.  Some of the stories are more relevant than others to the original film but overall the animation, the music and the flow are fantastic.
As for its connection to The Matrix, several of the clips are definitely attached to adding some details to lingering questions from The Matrix.  I suppose I was tremendously excited when some of my questions were answered by one of the cartoons included here.  Some of the other stories have a thread that connects them to the movie but most of them are really a world unto themselves.
If you liked the original film, you'll definitely want to check this one out.  If you love animation, you'll also want to check this one out.

Attempt to make a solid background story to the enslavement of humans in the matrix turns out laughable, lost amidst the super-pretentious narrative of the shiny program chick with the English accent (you know, cuz it's more intellectual that way), and a plethora of self important biblical references (""Man made machine, and for a time, it was good...UGH!) Also gives us no reason to root for the humans, as they're a bunch of reactionary slobs with no sense of pity or remorse. Reign On, O Noble Machines!
KID'S STORY: ****1/2 out of 5
Finally, some good stuff! Fascinating animation and story about the annoying kid from ""Reloaded."" Beautiful visuals and music.
PROGRAM: **1/2 out of 5
Nice swordfighting sequences, otherwise pretty ho-hum (And talk about a nasty trick...)
WORLD RECORD: ****1/2 out of 5
This seems to be the one all those cyber-pricks who can't stop raving about ""Final Flight"" have a problem with. Apparently ""Abstract"" isn't part of your vocabulary. Primitive but powerful, with a knockout ending; it's just that the agents look a little too much like vampires...
BEYOND: ***1/2 out of 5
A glitch in the Matrix as seen through kids' eyes. Engrossing, with some lovely imagery; haunting.
DETECTIVE STORY: *** out of 5
Excellent atmosphere, though a pedestrian story, from the makers of COWBOY BEBOP; nice ""Beginning is the End"" narration
MATRICULATED: ***** out of 5
Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant! Thought provoking story; beautiful, surreal visions; a perfect example of how stupid dialogue and narrative don't need to be incorporated to make a truly excellent piece of film.",1060819200,4,2063,5.052785923753666

1850721,3,B00008LDPV,"Animatrix, as others have noted, is a series of Japanese-animated prequels to the Matrix series of movies. The stories on the DVD range from pure anime to computer-generated super-realistic figures. Story-wise, it's a fun watch; it's always pleasing to see more to a fun film universe than just the film(s) and any book tie-ins.
That said--the DVD is one of the most poorly-engineered ones out there. Any other multilanguage DVD will allow you to choose (on the fly) between language tracks and subtitle tracks (including turning them on or off at a whim, something useful in environments where sound levels vary). This DVD prevents that; if you want to watch the movies in Japanese with English subtitles, you have to choose that _before_ watching--and if you change your mind later, you have to go back and start all over again. Skip to Beginning (of Chapter) doesn't work at all; so much for a quick restart. Choosing a very prominent link on most of the menu pages takes you to an all-but-inescapable copyright page.
So--if you're after content and nothing else, this is a definite must-have for a Matrix fan. If you like your DVDs well-crafted and a pleasure to use, just spring for the videotape version; no one expects navigation from a videotape. :)

I can't belive you people, You critisize this for being ugly or having no plot. DUH! It's not suppost to have plot. What it is are the Ideas the Wachowski brothers had that didn't fit into the movies in any way. They wanted to publish the cool ideas simply because they are cool! Allright, here's the episode by episode break down:
Final Flight of the Osiris -
 This is photo realisticly computer animated. It is basicly a prequal to the game ""Enter the Matrix"". At the end of FFOTO, a crew member drops of a message in a mailbox in the matrix, and the game starts with retriving that message from the post office, and after that first part, ""Enter the Matrix"" parallels the Movie, ""Matrix Reloaded"".
The Second Renaissance -
 Done in realistic drawn animation, this explanes the history of the world before the matrix up to the creation of the Matrix.
Kid's Story -
 Done in ""paint-style"" animation. Kid is that anoying kid from that begining of Matrix Reloaded, who keeps thanking neo for saving him. Well this shows what happens and how Kid escapes from the matrix.
WARNING - PAST THIS POINT THE SHORTS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIES!
Program -
 Done in Japanise style animation, this is a fight between to people in a medival training program, in which one of the W... brother's ideas comes out. I'll give you a clue (Syfer Training).
World Record -
 Done in a plain funky animation style that makes agents look like elvis... Basicly a track runner runs so hard his legs explode, but he keeps running anyway through sear will, and wakes up from the matrix for a moment...
Beyond -
 Done in the same style as Second Renaissance, this is a nicely done piece about just your average matrix inhabitants who find an old building that the local kids call a ""Haunted House"". When really it's just a glitchy place in the Matrix. Very Iteresting.
A Detective Story -
 Done in Black and White animation, this is a short story about a detective (among others) that was hired by an agent to find a mysterous Hacker by the name of Trinity...
Matriculated -
 Done in the same style as TSR, this is the most disturbing piece, about turning the machines in a virtual world to get them to swich sides willingly. ""To a machine, all reality is vurtual""... well that dosn't apply to humans, as when the machine trys to help this person, it plugs them back into the dream-world, but to catisrophic effect...
 Don't forget that there's also a bunch of speacial features incuding a trailer for ""Enter the Matrix"".",1059696000,,2612,4.552238805970149
1850724,2,B00008LDPV,"I just watched the animatrix last night with my little sister. I'm a total Matrix fan, but these anime cartoons were deeply unsettling. The final flight of the Osiris was tragic, but helpful for understanding Reloaded. The second renisance parts 1 and 2, were by far the most useful for understanding The Matrix trilogy, and the most unsettling. Program was weird in a non-scary way. Kid's story was a little strange, but not scary or dumb. World record was BORING maybye I didn't understand it, but all it was slo-mo and useless (to my point of view) information. Matrixified was unsettling and a snore to watch. Beyond was cool. It wasn't scary, but it was a little strange. About halfway through the anime cartoons, my dad came in and watched a little of them. He said they were boring... I would just like to remind you that no-one under 15, easily scared, easily bored, or was uninterested in The Matrix should watch these anime cartoons.",1059609600,7,943,4.721212121212122
1850725,5,B00008LDPV,"This DVD is awesome! It's better than the Matrix Reloaded Movie! It covers all you need to know to understand the Matrix inside. Don't buy the movie, buy the Animatrix DVD.",1059350400,,172,4.580645161290323
1850726,3,B00008LDPV,"This is undeniably a great idea; fleshing out a fictional world with nine animated shorts. I appreciate that the Wachowskis are trying to design a multi-media franchise from the ground up, done right. However, the execution falls short.
FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS
Not so much a story as three interconnected set-pieces: a swordplay-foreplay martial arts scene, a running battle between a hovercraft and a swarm of hunter robots, and a Freemind making a run through the Matrix.
Photo-realistic reproductions of moving human beings never seem to quite work right (maybe it's because they don't have tongues).
PROGRAM
One Freemind tempts another with happily-ever-after in the Matrix, while fighting through a samurai fantasy virtual world. This plays with the way people will say and do different things in different environments.
KID'S STORY
Where's they get the idea for this one? A fanfic written by a 12-year-old? At best, it's an immature ego fantasy. At worst, it's playing into the belief that you can escape your humdrum reality by sheer force of will, the kind of thinking that made the Tokyo subway gassing and Columbine possible.
SECOND RENNAISSANCE I,II
A mythic retelling of the world's back story, the rise of the AIs and the war that nearly destroyed humanity. The visual storytelling is excellent and produces some memorable images.
The biggest problem is that it follows the ludicrous backstory that humanity created the nuclear winter effect to kill the machines, instead of vice versa, which would make far more sense. Plus it sticks with the ""humans as power source"" nonsense. Hopefully, the Wachowskis will ret-con this foolishness out of continuity some day.
DETECTIVE STORY
A triumph of visual atmosphere over anything else. A detective searches for Trinity and discovers how she can just disappear.
WORLD RECORD
The most original of the stories. A sprinter's attempt to crack the speed record attracts the attention of Agents. Makes sprinting look as violent as pro boxing.
BEYOND
Probably the most beautiful of the stories. A woman searches for her cat in an abandoned house, where reality has a few glitches. Time stretches, snaps back, repeats. Gravity fluctuates. It captures those odd moments of magic where you feel the rules are momentarily changed.
MATRICULATED
They definitely saved the best for last. Peter Chung brings his patented brand of psychosexual weirdness to the Matrix, and it's a perfect mix. (Watch ""Aeon Flux"" and you'll see the resemblance.)
A team of freeminds attempt to bring a hunter robot over to their side by giving it a human-like body in a fantasy world. Since machines don't dream, they have no way to consider one reality more real than any other. When their base is attacked, which side will the robot choose?
Chung's work proves that you can tell a story that is visually exciting and sexy, yet thought-provoking. If anybody in the U.S. should be making animated feature films, it's Chung.
The Animatrix is sweet, but only four stories (""Program"", ""World Record"", ""Beyond"", ""Matriculated"") didn't leave me feeling like I had eaten a cup of icing sugar. Still, four out of nineis much better than Sturgeon's Law would suggest. I hope that they don't abandon this idea, and keep making animated shorts.",1059177600,2,3259,5.104868913857678

1850740,3,B00008LDPV,"I really wanted to give this two and a half stars rather than three, but there's no facility to do that.
I first saw this compilation in the cinema instead of as a DVD and despite the Dolby surround and the massive screen by the time it was two thirds of the way through I was looking at my watch and trying to work out how many more there were to go.

1850741,2,B00008LDPV,"I was eagerly anticipating the release of Animatrix.  Now, after viewing it, I am very disappointed in the product as a whole and even somewhat offended.
First, the Good.  ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" was incredible.  Clearly the best of the features.  Some of the most expressive and impressive animation I have ever seen.  ""Kid's Story"" was intriguing and clarifies a question I had after watching ""Matrix: Reloaded.""  ""Beyond"" was also very interesting in that it shows a fascinating concept of a glitch in the Matrix and does it in a somewhat charming manner.
Now the Bad.  I found the animation in most of the features to be extraordinarily poor.  This is not because I am an anime hater!  When it comes to Japanimation, I can take it or leave it depending on each individual work.  Yes, I understand that there is a cultural difference between Japan and the US when it comes to animation, but I know what I like.  What I don't like is human figures that are so grotesquely drawn that they become a distraction to watch (the best example of this is ""World Record"").  While I mentioned above that I liked ""Kid's Story,"" the animation in that was so poorly drawn (albeit probably on purpose) that it became difficult to follow the action.  Of course, there is also the tendency in anime to make things excessively gory, which I also find a tad unnecessary.
And finally, the Offensive.  ""The Second Renaissance"" was absolutely terrible.  The animation was decent (save the gore mentioned previously) but the story was trite and insulting.  The viewer is expected to endure countless jabs at the Christian faith and the depiction of everyone in the world, with the exception of the machines' ""liberal sympathizers,"" as blood-thirsty, intolerant, hateful, war-mongering cretins, especially Americans.  We are then shown several well-known scenes from the worst of human history including communist Vietnam, communist China, and Nazi Germany.  However, the scenes are altered to place robots in the victims' places and, although none of the original scenes used as inspiration in this feature occurred in the US or involved Americans, they now all feature Americans as the villains.  I know that the intent was to push the limits and make the story very dramatic, even uncomfortable, but it blew past that line and went straight to contentious and vile.
Overall, I gave this DVD a 2-star rating, out of respect for ""Final Flight of the Osiris.""  Otherwise, it would easily have earned the lowest rating.",1058659200,6,2502,4.940191387559809

1850748,5,B00008LDPV,"Final Flight of the Osiris: Many people liked this short alot. I have to admit the CGI was great but I thought it was lacking. It was very short and didn't really explain anything we don't know. But it is worth watching.
The second renaissance parts I and II: These two shorts had to be my favorite on the DVD. They were AWESOME. The animation was beautiful and I loved the narration and whole explanation of how it was humans who were responsible for the beginning of The Matrix. Watch it and many things will be clear to you. Kind of a prequel to The Matrix movie.
Kid's Story- If you have seen Reloaded and was at all interested in the kid who claimed Neo saved his life you will definitely want to see this short. It shows what happened and how the kid is tied to Neo. I personally enjoyed this one. The animation was very very nice and I just thought it was an excellent addition to the explanation of Reloaded.
Program- I liked it because I didn't find it at all predictable. I didn't know where it was going and until the end you are left kind of confused. A 3 out of 5 rating for this one.
World Record- I definitely did NOT like this one AT ALL. It was bland and the character was not appealing. I only watched it once and maybe i didn't get the jist of it but I didn't find it appealing enough to watch again.
Beyond- Many people enjoyed this one saying it was ""touching"" but  i thought it pointless. I guess it was ""cute"" but other then that, not much point to it.
A Detective Story- I LOVED this one! If you like Trinity you are in for a treat, the only short which features a character from the movies (besides a short appearance by Neo in ""Kid's story""). It's filmed in black and white and gives it a styliazed feel. Not much explanation about where Trinity is from or her real name though...
Matriculated- I didn't enjoy this one much. Characters weren't all that great. Very bizzare. But deep meaning, i suppose.
So in conclusion, This DVD was jam packed with excellent shorts and I recommend it for any Matrix fan! It's a must have!",1057449600,,2049,4.294573643410852
1850749,3,B00008LDPV,"I was really psyched to get this DVD, and would spend all night downloading the previews from the website before it's release.  Unfortunately, the best clips are the ones that are available for free download off of the site, and the extras really didn't add much to me.  The only exception is the short entitled ""Beyond"" which is an incredible story about a glitch in the Matrix.  Here's the play-by-play:
1.  Final Flight of the Osiris:  CGI short by Square (Final Fantasy) which is the setup for the invasion of Zion.  It's okay, but I'm not a big fan of Square's CGI work (the characters look too artificial and creepy for me).
2.  The Second Renaissance (2 parts):  Supposedly, this was the first idea for the Matrix ""prequel"" but now redone as a short anime.  Essential viewing for those who want to know how the whole Matrix got started, and tells the tale of the AI revolution, and how the sky was scorched.  #3 in rank for me.
3.  Kid's Story:  Uh...that annoying twerp that bothers Neo when he returns to Zion in Reloaded?  This is his story.  Doesn't make him any more sympathetic in my opinion.
4.  Program:  Predictable story, but great great great samurai action!
5.  World Record:  An athelete's record breaking run violates the parameters of the Matrix.  Just weird.
6.  Beyond:  The best in the bunch, sweet tale about some kids who find a glitch in the Matrix.  Incredible animation, and the voice acting here is the best on the whole disc.
7.  A Detective Story:  From the maker of the popular Cowboy Bebop.  A private investigator searches for Trinity.  Outstanding story and an anime version of Trinity!  The #2 tale on the disc.
8.  Matriculated:  From the maker of Aeon Flux.  Human commandos capture and retrain machines.  If you saw that, you've seen this.  Makes little sense, and ends badly.",1057190400,,1817,4.66984126984127

This coming from a Matrix fan who printed out flyers ins school and put them all around the hallways announcing the arrival of Matrix Reloaded, which I would give a three out of five.

Second Renisance is not as well drawn in my opinion, but the story is the point of that tale. Powerful and disturbing, it starts to explain the past of the Matrix. It packs in more thought provoking material than the two movies do in a tenth the time.
Other peices, such as Beyond or Program, suffer from mediocre art and writing, that while acceptable, is simply forgetable. The same goes for Kid's Story.
World Record is just bad, with a lousy story and horid art. Skip it, you will be thankful for saving the 15 minutes. The last peice, Matriculated, has too many ""huh"" things in it to be enjoyable, IF you can get past the art. Matriculated is produced by the team who inflicted Aeon Flux and Reign on the anime community, and they are getting better. But it still is too much about people with funny body angles, battling the forces of evil in armoured skivvies. Too weird, too dull, and too out of continuity with the rest of the story line.
In short, a third of it is good, very good, even if it is hard to watch. Another third is watchable. And trust me, don't even watch Matriculated or World Record- your mind will be happier with you.",1056931200,,1329,4.428571428571429

Final Flight of the Osiris
An interesting short; however it only really needed one go. The story that it provided was, indeed, important to the continuity of the Matrix storyline. Yet, it was mostly just showing off the new rendering software. I believe that is enough on that.
The Second Renaissance Part I & II
These deserve more than their first impression. The information that needs to be conveyed within these shorts its not of the most pleasant nature. While utterly gruesome at moments, it does all have meaning. Watch them through a second time and you'll know what I mean.
Kid's Story
Ah, the first short by the director of Bebop. A flowing tale with an equally flowing animation style. Probably my favorite of the shorts. A long drawn out story with an amazing conclusion. Although the few people that may be able to relate to this story will possess a deeper understanding. Not to be missed.
Program
A short, classic clip. Poses ideas upon ideas upon ideas while keeping the visuals very cool. At the minimum you have to admit that the girls hair is awesome. Not to be missed.
World Record
While some may say the visuals are un-pleasing, I agree with the old saying ""A picture is worth a thousand words"". Seeing as this is a nine minute clip, hand drawn, with 24 frames per/second, I'd say it's worth about twelve million nine hundred and sixty thousand words. That's quite a few. Again, not to be missed (under any circumstances).
Beyond
One of the most amazing. Poses a glitch in the system that a girl stumbles into. Not to miss.
A Detective Story
Very classy. I've never actually seen artistically B&W anime before but it is a very nice touch. I'll just call this the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass short. It is more the latter though.
Matriculated
Peter Chung. What more needs to be said. Well other than a review of course. Taking on the feeling of Aeon Flux Matriculated asks a simple question: What happens when a robot is introduced to a human created matrix? And what happens when it falls in love with anti-reality? Not to be missed.
To sum it all up The Animatrix requires a certain level of...depth. Not to insult various reviewers *mumble* but this collection should be treated as a set of independent movies, not a mainstream bit. Now while The Matrix offered the independent movie feel it also kept a mainstream feel. You could say that is where this collection is lacking. Bottom Line, if you enjoy Anime (or are an old fan) then buy it. If you've never seen anime but find yourself on IFC all the time, buy it. If both apply, buy the special edition. If neither, *shudder* rent *shudder* it.",1056758400,,2836,4.640159045725646
1850778,4,B00008LDPV,"This DVD wasn't too bad. My favorite were the first 4 stories, even though two episodes were one long story. The only story I didn't like was the last one, I just don't understand how loading a machine into a program converts him. But oh well. I have to say that *most* of the animation was very good. Overall this was a pretty good DVD, but I would only reccomend a purchase for the ""hard core"" fans, because it's kind of repetive. For the rest of you I'd say either use or get your Blockbuster card.",1056672000,,501,4.229166666666667
1850779,5,B00008LDPV,"When I watched the Matrix for the first time I thought that it was a good entertaining movie but nothing more. When I watched the Matrix Reloaded I thought that this was an intelligently written well done film. When I watched the Animatrix I thought this is pure sci-fi.
The Animatrix in my mind grounds the Matirx films as some of the most intelligent and well made sci-fi that has come out in a long time. Up on the level of film works like Blade Runner, 2001 & Akira. Intentional or not, it also pays homage to great sci-fi books like William Gibsons Neuromancer and Frank Herberts Dune.
For a long time Japanese animation has picked up the slack of good sci-fi storytelling and concepts that most American sci-fi films have neglected. Look at Ghost in the Shell. The fact that the Matrix films are encompassing the deeper aspects of what makes good science fiction into something that the largely gullable American public can digest is wonderful. Like great science fiction, I will return to this stuff again and again to be taken in awe at the creative and intellectual forces that made this.
I can't wait for the third film.",1056672000,,1130,4.626865671641791
1850780,3,B00008LDPV,"I had mixed feelings after watching this dvd.
""Final Flight Of the Osiris"" is hands down the stand out short story, and it is good, having most to do with the actual Matrix movies than the rest of this mixed bag did.
Some of the stories in this offering are just crazy, disjointed, R-rated cartoons that don't look or feel like anything from the Matrix with the exception of some of the terminology used.
What's worse is that (at least I deduced) the people who created these cartoons are actually attached to the Matrix movies.  Some of this was just [bad], in my opinion, and doesn't belong to be associated with the Matrix franchise.
Also the quality of some of these cartoons just did not live up to the ""state of the art"" quality advertised with this dvd.  Once again the ""Osiris"" story far outperformed the other ones.
This dvd is not for everyone.  Hardcore Matrix fans will probably like it quite a bit but less-involved fans who just think it's a cool story will be less likely to embrace some of the material...",1056672000,,1021,4.538043478260869
1850781,5,B00008LDPV,"To anyone who is familiar with Anime, or Japanimation, the Japanese influences on the makers of the Matrix should be clear. The energy and style of the action scenes in this sci-fi modern classic are borrowed directly from the classic Anime features of the 80s and 90s like Ghost In The Shell, Akira and Ninja Scroll. What we see in Animatrix is a fascinating project: The best directors and animators in Japanime were approached by the Wachowski Bros. to create short animated stories taking place in the reality of the Matrix saga. The result: nine short films by seven different directors. Each of the creators took the ideas that make the Matrix to entirely different ends, and each film uses different styles and techniques of animation and storytelling. Not one of them is traditional Japanese animation, and though each one borrows from its old and respectable roots, each one is surprising and unique in a very different way. That makes this compilation of the nine films a very rewarding watching experience, if you're interested in either the Matrix or animation in general, or both.
The first segment, The Final Flight Of The Osiris, is a direct prequel to Matrix Reloaded, though it features none of the lead characrers from the movies. It's my least favorite movie in the series, but makes for a good start to the collection. The animation here is entirely computerized 3D graphics, and as technology goes it's the most impressive film in the series.
The two part movie The Second Renaissance (directed by Mahiro Maeda) looks more like traditional anime. It's essential for eager Matrix fans, because it chronicles the Second Renaissance and man's war against the machines - events that were only referred to in the movie Matrix. It's a fascinating watch, more for the story than for the animation.
Kid's Story (directed by the brilliant Shinichir Watanabe of Cowboy Bebop fame) is the first movie here that really caught my attention. A rather small story about one of the many people who realized the truth about the Matrix and were freed to reality (with Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss doing small cameos), the animation on Kid's Story is as far as you can get from any kind of traditional animation, Japanese or otherwise. It's energetic, powerful, and hypnotically beautiful.
The World Records was created by Takeshi Koike (director) and Yoshiaki Kawajiri (writer), the immensely talented team that worked together on the cult classic Ninja Scroll. Koike's very unique art style comes on strongly on this segment, with his deformed characters, exaggerated motion and expression and very strong shadowing, and the characters' motion is strong and beautiful.
The Program, directed by Kawajiri himself, is relatively closer to classic anime, but it's well written and has good energy. Not one of my favorites, though.
A Detective Story was both written and directed by Shinichir Watanabe. Unlike his other work, Kid's Story, a Detective Story greatly resembles his work on Cowboy Bebop. It blends the atmosphere and clichs of classic film noir into the Matrix reality, and has great writing and animation. The art is in black on white, with a great gritty texture that gives it a real film noir feel.
Beyond is a rather small story about children in Japan who find a `haunted house', where objects appear and disappear, and people can float in the air and defy the rules of nature - actually, of course it's just a glitch in the Matrix and the Agents are soon sent to remedy the situation. The long scene of the children playing in the haunted house is beautiful and imaginative, and wonderfully animated.
Matriculated, the final segment, is a very difficult and disturbing one, and I didn't really care for the choice of putting it last in the series. Psychedelic and very philosophical, Matriculated is shown mainly from a machine's point of view.
The bonus features on the DVD are also fantastic: they include fascinating documentaries on all each film, and also on the project in general and on the history and tradition of Japanese animation. For animation enthusiasts, this DVD is a must.",1056672000,,4112,4.978197674418604
1850782,3,B00008LDPV,"Before watching this dvd I was all in favor of its concept.  Normally, great movies rarely give the audience a chance to fully understand the background of the story, but this dvd promises to do just that.  To that it, end only marginally succeeds.
This dvd collects nine stories from the Matrix universe, some that directly tie into the movies, and others that do not.  This, in my mind, is where the dvd's problems arise.  The stories involving known characters and events are wonderful, but the wholly original works lack spirit and direction.
I gave this dvd 3 stars because the short episodes about the war with the machines, the discovery of the digging machines, and the search for Trinity all work wonderfully, if a bit unfocused.  The downfall is in the other tales using characters with no tie to anything except the universe they are in.
In my opinion, this dvd would have worked much better if it had gone into more detail about the rise of AI, as well as other points the movie's only mention.  The different artistic styles only fueled the lack of focus of these stories.  Either the creators were trying to push to much info through in a short time span, or the artists took too many liberties with the script.
This dvd also has some interesting extras.  Insight into its creation as well as others provide a small amount of enjoyment besides the films.  These, however, are no reason to purchase the dvd if you are not a fan of the films, all of which can be seen online fairly easily.
All in all, this dvd is an interesting companion to the Matrix films, but it is probably best to rent instead of purchase.",1056672000,,1624,4.553264604810996
1850783,4,B00008LDPV,"The Animatrix consists of nine animated short films that are part of the Matrix universe.  They deal with various aspects of the universe and some interact directly with the two movies.  As the films are each made by different directors/animation houses, they all have different looks and feels to them.  Each film is about 10 minutes long.  Naturally, some are better than others.
Final Flight of the Osiris:  This one is referenced near the beginning of the Matrix Reloaded.  This film has the crew of the Osiris discovering the Sentinel army drilling down to Zion.  Considering the title, we know what happens to the ship, but this is one of the better films of the bunch.  The animation was done by Square (the makers of the Final Fantasy movie) and it surpasses their previous work.  The CGI is so well done that at times you can forget that this is not real.
The Second Renaissance Parts I and II: These two films are connected.  These films are a prehistory to the Matrix.  We see how machines came into power and the war against Man and Machine.  In the Matrix we are told that man blotted out the sun.  In Part II we see how this is done.  This is essential viewing as it is the history document of the Matrix.  This is the how and the why the machines came to power and through it we see things that perhaps could have been done differently.  If only.
Kid's Story:  I didn't think this was that great of a short film, but it connects directly into the Matrix Reloaded.  There is a character in that movie trying to follow Neo around and says several times that Neo saved him.  Neo replies that he saved himself.  This is the story of that character and how he was freed from the Matrix.  I found this one interesting because of the connection to the movie, but that is the only reason.  This features the guest voices of Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss.
Program:  Most of this film is fight sequences between two people in what feels like a training program.  The man is trying to convince the woman that she needs to forget about the Matrix and the real world because while they wanted to know the truth, it would be better to live an artificial life in ignorance.  I liked some of the ideas of this film, but the presentation was somewhat lacking.
World Record:  I'll admit that I'm a geek for track and field.  This one features an athlete who broke the world record in the 100 meters in the prelims and wants to shatter his own record so that it will never be touched.  He also becomes someone who is unknowingly able to affect the Matrix (thus the world record).  It features slow motion action for the track portion as well as flashbacks of how he got to that point.  Interesting for me, but I'm not sure about anyone else.
Beyond: Beyond did not connect as well as some of the films to the Matrix, but it is probably going to become a favorite.  Beyond follows a young woman who lost her cat.  She (and several children) discover a ""haunted"" house where weird things happen.  Gravity and other laws of physics are able to be circumvented without any of the control that someone manipulating the Matrix would need.  A sweet little story.
A Detective Story: This is my favorite short film of the bunch.  This is done in black and white and is a classic detective story (like one would find in the stories of Marlowe).  The dectective (truly a stereotype character) is contacted to try to find a hacker named Trinity (yes, that Trinity).  It is a sweet little story and is visually impressive.  Features the guest voice of Carrie Anne Moss.
Matriculated: This is my least favorite of the bunch.  It did not make any sense to me.  It was the story of humans capturing a machine, hooking it up to the Matrix and trying to convert it to the cause of humanity.  Throughout the film there was a lot of strange visuals that reminded me of an Isaac Asimov story without any of the depth or plotting.  I found this to be the weakest of the bunch.",1056672000,2,3954,4.434722222222222
1850784,4,B00008LDPV,"The Animatrix has its ups and downs. Up: ""Final Flight of the Osiris"", which is a sort of prelude to The Matrix Reloaded and features excellent animation from the same people that made Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within; and ""Second Renaissance Parts I & II"", which chronicles how the whole dispute between man and machine began and is truly an awesome experience. Down: While a couple of the other 6 episodes are also good, none of them really stands out as being exceptional, and a couple of them just confused me. Up: There is over an hour of extra features. Down: Most of the people who created The Animatrix speak Japanese, so you have to read sub-titles most of the time. Overall, I highly recommend The Animatrix if you love The Matrix and are up for some deep thinking. Otherwise, I would advise you to stay away.",1056585600,,820,4.585034013605442
1850785,5,B00008LDPV,"This is what I LOVE about the Matrix: when you think you've got it all figured out, you'll read a review from someone else putting a whole new twist on the story, making you discover aspects of it you didn't quite catch before. I can personally spend hours happily reading all the reviews connected to any Matrix product, always fascinated at the power it has to make people think. As a fanatic of anything Matrix, I wanted to get this DVD even though I must state that I was not an anime fan to begin with and didn't expect to like all the material. Well, I was proven wrong.
True, not all 9 shorts are of equal quality, each one with its own animation and storytelling style. Whether you'll prefer one over the other really depends on your personal tastes. In my case, I have my favorites but must admit that each piece, even the ones which I feel are weaker, have some redeeming qualities which make up for their shortcomings.
""Final Flight of the Osiris"" is without a doubt my personal favorite. This story could easily have been a part of Reloaded but since that movie was quite long to begin with, it was a very good idea to include it here instead. From the creators of ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"", the animation all in CGI is even better this time around, with a few years of technological progress. Some of the characters are so well done that they almost feel human, especially the male lead Thadeus. The story is erotic, chilling and moving at the same time. A must see.
""The second Renaissance Part I&II"" is my second favorite with a backstory to how the machines have come to enslave humans. I love the new spin this has put on the story where we discover that the machines are not as totally evil as we had previously thought. Quite violent and disturbing with images that will stay with you for a long time afterwards. Not for the squirmish and definitely not for kids.
I also have to mention ""Matriculated"". I really loved it even though I saw that quite a few reviewers didn't seem to agree. It is the most abstract short here with a lot of psychedelic and very colorful imagery which is a big part of why I loved it. I also appreciated the reversal story where a robot is immerged into a virtual world created by the minds of several humans so they can entice him to join them in their resistance against the machines. The animation style was very much to my liking and I really loved the robot who ends becoming quite likable, therefore complicating the Matrix story even more, adding a very interesting spin to the mix.
""Program"", ""Beyond"", ""Kid's story"" and ""A Detective's story"" are engaging as well with different animation styles and stories I liked in various degrees. Only ""World Record"" is, in my opinion, not as strong as the others and I found myself not really connecting to its very unusual animation technique nor its somewhat static plot, even though it is still worth seeing.
The extras are also noteworthy and I found myself captivated by the different directors and various crew members explaining how they came to craft these shorts with a lot of patience and dedication. Finally, for me the ultimate proof that this DVD is a must resides in the fact that after viewing it, I got the urge to seek out some classics in the Japanese Anime world, even though I really wasn't a big fan of it before. The Wachowsky brothers succeeded in my case to convert an anime neophyte into a fan. No small feat.
Any Matrix fan has got to see this. And remember, one element which is very important in the Matrix world is to retain the freedom to make up your own mind and form your own opinion. Don't let any negative reviews keep you from seeing this. And once you've watched, write a review and put your own spin on it!",1056412800,,3750,4.491947291361639
1850786,4,B00008LDPV,"I'll have to admit that this was a stroke of brilliant genius that would undoubtedly be a great seller.  You combine many of the traditional elements that fan-boys hold dear in one package and offer something in addition: CGI, cell animation, manga, the Matrix universe as a common theme, comic-book-like stories, good writing, and most importantly a solid background on what the casual movie watcher may miss--backgrounds and origins of plotlines discussed in the Matrix and Matrix Reloaded.
What awaits you and your friends are 9 well thought out and clever short anime movies.  Ranging from 5-15 minutes each, the varying styles of animation here should please just about every anime palette.
What I found amongst this DVD's highlighted shorts were:
1) The Second Renaissance parts 1 & 2: A great traditional cell film with an awesome backgrounds story that really lays the foundation of events that lead up to the formation of The Matrix.
2) Detective Story: A throwback to B&W film noir, the Detective Story does well in developing Trinity in Matrix lore while giving the viewer a taste of pulp movies of the 40's.
3) Final Flight of the Osiris: All CG, but a parallel story of another awakened crew running from Sentinels.  The CG work here was phenomenal and really made the Matrix 'hero' universe seem bigger than just Neo and his crew.
4) Beyond: A beautifully animated story clearly grounded in Japanese tones unveils the fact that there are some people (notably children) who awaken within the matrix and discover a 'magical zone' in which their dreams come true...but the viewer will discover it is an area within the matrix that is suffering from an internal glitch.  Very deep and a thinking man's short.
A requisite documentary adds to the value of the DVD, but it was expected and nothing super special.
Animated menu's are always nice, but I found these ones a tad busy and a little overdone.
A trailer to a video game that has gotten a lack-luster reviews is not what I call a DVD bonus enhancement.  In a few years we'll look back and know the game is obsolete and no longer available depending on what future console platforms are like so I don't see any value to this.",1056412800,2,2189,4.78042328042328
1850787,5,B00008LDPV,"Animatrix is a welcome twist in the Matrix series.  Those of us who are the true fans of Matrix world will find this series of episodes to be a creative elaboration on the concept of the Matrix universe.  It could also be a device used by Warchovski's to keep our hunger to see Matrix Revolutions at bay.
  While some episodes are free standing, Kid's Story and Final Flight of Osiris are intimately linked to the events of the Matrix: Reloaded.  Those of us who loved the Matrix have to admit; the idea of machines creating an artificial reality is a great one.  Warchowski's were not the first ones to come up with the idea of dream skepticism but their execution of it makes for a fascinating concept.
 The idea of the Matrix is filled with mystery, danger, fear, and much of unknown and unexplored.
The use of the animation was a great idea to address some of the plot holes of the Matrix series as well as to create more entertainment for those of us who want to see Matrix without Keanu Revees.  What makes Animatrix a good DVD is that it incorporates nine wholly different stories and styles of presentation.  While some will dislike particular episode or episodes most of us will walk away with at least one element or a story as profoundly touching.  In other words, you might not like all, but at least something here.
  Two episodes in the Animatrix are especially worthy of note. They are Matriculated and Program.  Even though both of these episodes do not seem to appeal to general liking they are particularly profound and entertaining.  Matriculated is very abstract piece and unlike some other episodes its message is not spoon feed directly to the audience.  The visual imagery was stunning and memorable and was intended to make us come up with our own interpretations of what seemed bizarre.  Perhaps Matriculated yields a hint at what will happen in Matrix Revolutions.",1056412800,,1890,4.699088145896656
1850788,4,B00008LDPV,"Here's my two cents on the disjointed/odd nature of the short films.  I think it's best to view this collection as like a ""special feature"" of ""deleted scenes"" from the Matrix trilogy, things that fans might want to see afterwards, but aren't quite good enough for, or don't fit into, the movies.  I for one like seeing deleted scenes from movies I really like, and I think this DVD is best for people who have a more active interest in the world of the Matrix.",1056326400,,461,4.411764705882353
1850789,5,B00008LDPV,"After reading some reviews it seems that fans of the Matrix either loved the Animatrix or hated it. If you're expecting these short animes to resemble anything like the Matrix then perhaps its not for you. But if you have an open mind to explore different visions and perspectives of the Matrix then you're in for a real treat.
This project after all was the brainchild of the brothers Wachowski who presented several of the original stories to be animated and who had the final say in which stories made the final cut. What I do like is that they allowed these top-notch anime producers to have lots of freedom is the way the stories were expressed and some of the producers created the most original stories of their own. Fans of Ninja Scroll, Aeon Flux, Neon Genesis, Cowboy Bebop will not be dissapointed with this collection. It is a wonderful way to sample works from anime producers with vastly different styles and original storytelling.
""Final Flight of the Osiris"" ""Renaissance"" and ""Program"" are to me the most true to the Matrix. For originality in stories my favorites are: Kid's Story, Beyond, World Record, and Matriculated. For animated sequences that had me in awe are World Record (highly stylized), and A Detective's Story (effectively done in black and white).
And don't miss the Director's interviews and commentaries. This was my favorite part of the DVD offering. These interviews add so much more depth to the animes as the each producer guides the viewer in his unique vision and development of the storyboards. To me its ironic that these masters of anime are so unanimated in the way they describe their work! Rather, their interviews are refreshingly humble and down-to-earth, so unlike their Western-counterparts.
This DVD has me seeking out other works from these master anime producers.",1056326400,,1817,4.9411764705882355

Some of them are very important, if one wants to fully understand reloaded, as they tell the stories that were only briefly mentioned, and also let you know who that annoying kid was that greeted them when they first got to zion.
The animation is first-rate, done by some of the top anime houses around. If you think animation is for children, then you definitely need to see this to show you what the medium can do for a story.
An excellent set of stories, pay attention to the ratings, there is as much violence in these as there are in the movies.",1056326400,,622,4.464912280701754
1850791,5,B00008LDPV,"The Animatrix is a curiosity and it serves to highlight clearly the Wachowski brother's committment to this project. A series of short (each about ten minutes) animated adventures set in the world of the Matrix movies, The Animatrix explores the themes and possibilities of the movies using different techniques from CGI to traditional Anime.
As a fan of CGI the two standout pieces for me were ""Last Flight of the Osiris"" and ""Matriculated"". ""Last Flight of the Osiris"" (from the team responsible for ""Final Fantasy"") is jaw dropping state of the art hyper-real CGI. It is obvious that much of the Matrix Reloaded was produced in this way. The opening scene is absolutely delicious as two very attractive CGI characters disrobe eachother in a virtual martial arts sword fight. The piece goes on to illustrate a link between the first two movies in the Matrix trilogy.
But the one that really got me was ""Matriculated"". An astounding blend of CGI and handrawn animation this film really explores the possibilities of the medium and the results are mind-blowing, and quite psychadelic in places. A curious story about a group of humans who attempt to convert machines to their cause, ""Matriculated"" really pushes the boundaries. For hardcore fans it is worth owning the DVD for these two pieces alone, however the other pieces are excellent too, using more standard animation techniques to tell their stories. Those with a passing interest in the Matrix movies will probably be happier just renting The Animatrix.
If you are unfamiliar with Anime it is worth noting that it often contains strong violence and sexual material, and the Animatrix is no exception. One scene in particular depicted violence against a robot made to look like a human woman and I found this quite uncomfortable to watch.
After watching The Animatrix I am left feeling confident that despite the unexpected success of the first Matrix movie, the Wachowski brothers are committed to bringing the Matrix to the World with integrity. A lot of people have been disappointed in the second movie, but seen in the context of an action packed comic book sci-fi saga it all makes sense, and its really working for me. It is not going to be to everyone's taste, but this is to the directors' credit, not to their detriment.",1056240000,,2288,4.930051813471502

Second Renasiacnace Part 1 & 2 is great since it is a prequel to the films.  Kid's story explains who that annoying kid that pops up in Matrix Reloaded.

And the answer was ""I don't care."" I love anime. That's why I watched the Animatrix. When anime goes bad it's REALLY bad. The problem many animes have is there's too much complicated chatter that the average person will hear as ""blah blah blah."" The dry dialog is enough to put anybody to sleep. The animation is beautiful. So the one star I'm giving it will stand for that. But at one point I felt as if I were watching ""Final Fantasy."" The characters and backgrounds look like they have been ripped directly from that movie. But it is clear that they did not have as much time to develop this story as they did on Final Fantasy because the animation is choppy and doesn't flow at all. The lips never match up to the voices and the faces have no emotion at all. All in all this DVD is a waste of time. What is happening is the story of the Matrix is being ruined by all this junk coming out. Toys, video games, TV shows, short stories, and worst of all, one sequel right after the other that only tells the exact same story the first movie told.

1850794,5,B00008LDPV,"THE ANIMATRIX is a series of nine groundbreaking animated shorts designed as companion pieces to the MATRIX film trilogy, each about 5-10 minutes in length, the longest is about 20 minutes. This is also produced by the Wachowski Bros. and Joel Silver. The range of animation techniques on display here is simply astounding- which easily makes this a 5 star DVD, but THE ANIMATRIX will possibly hold the most appeal to MATRIX fanatics who know the movies inside and out (I'm not one of them so cut me a little slack, mmkay?). What I found most amusing is that the end credits to the films run twice as long as the shorts!
The features are as follows, with my personal faves denoted by an asterisk:
1. FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS (This was screened in NZ as a short film before DREAMCATCHER, which I haven't seen yet.)
2. THE SECOND RENAISSANCE PART 1.
3. THE SECOND RENAISSANCE PART 2. (Logically enough).
4. KID'S STORY*: Unlike the first three shorts, KID'S STORY actually has a good human interest plot at its core and absolutely brilliant animation. It's about Michael Copper, a geeky high school kid with an obsession with THE MATRIX movies, who finds himself the target of Agents. Best of all, regular schmucks like me can follow it with no problem. Woohoo!
5. PROGRAM*: I can't adequately put this one into words, but once you see it you'll understand why. (Yeah, because as I acknowleged in one of my earlier reviews, I'm an uncultured chump.) Anyway, this rocks. Take my word for it.
6. WORLD RECORD: In this anecdote, a World Class track sprinter tries to break his own record, but in the tradition of sci-fi wackiness this doesn't go according to plan. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that his coach looks like the World's worst (c)rapper Vanilla Ice. Mercifully, he doesn't start pumping his fist and chanting ""Go White Boy Go White Boy Go!"". Whew!
7. BEYOND*: A teenage girl searching for her missing cat traces her pet's whereabouts to a haunted house. There's loads of surprises and great visual FX in this short.
8. A DETECTIVE STORY*: Excellent black and white detective noir anime in which a Private Eye is hired by agents to capture Trinity. The only catch is the last Detective assigned the same case ended up going stark raving bonkers...
9. MATRICULATED*: Final short is the longest at 20 mins, but this one's a real stunner, which is why I won't spoil anything by summarising it.
All in all, THE ANIMATRIX is a dazzling showcase for a broad range of talented animators; though personally SPONGEBOB's still #1 in my book. It's just personal taste. Check it out.",1055980800,,2592,4.68640350877193

The first three films were written by the Wachowski Brothers and deal with the films directly like what happened to the Osiris and why that boy always follows Neo around.  The rest of the films range from wonderful (Detective Story) to down right freaky (matriculated), but absolutely great.  I would highly recommend this for any anime fan and fan of the Matrix.

Pretty obvious difference in quality between that and the others.  Had they shown any of the others in the theatre, there would have been a stampede to the bathroom to hurl.

1850797,1,B00008LDPV,"I found the Animatrix really disappointing.  Part One and Two of ""The Second Renaissance"" was just awful! These two animations tell the story of how mankind was conquered by the machines.  There MAJOR flaws from beginning to end.  For example, the narration mentions that the humans dropped nuclear weapons on the machine city with no effect because radiation has no effect on a machine.  Yet, every nuclear bomb creates an EMP blast that kills all electrical equipment...something that they use in The Matrix movies...duh. Another example is that the machine run on solar power.  What do humans do?  Black out the sky.  Hmmm, let's not bomb the solar panels first, right? Finally, my favorite example: the machines build their nation in the ""Cradle of Civilization."" They build their city in the Middle East...and as we all know, the Middle East is just FULL of peace and love and EVERYONE is open to EVERYONE their.  A machine city smack in the Middle East would last as long as a snowball. Just utter stupidity!
There are plenty more stupid moments that just do not seem possible.  I mean, they are utterly ridiculous. I expected better from the Warchowski Brothers.",1055894400,5,1169,4.893401015228426
1850798,5,B00008LDPV,"Instead of reviewing the entire thing I'll just review the actual movies(mostly).
Final Flight of the Osiris-
This short was made by the Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within people and is just gorgeous. The opening fight sequence was pretty much unessecary but fun enough that you don't care anyway. The story is basically about...well the final flight of the Osiris, and how they discover the army digging to Zion. It is also one of the two shorts that actually relate directly to the movie The Matrix: Reloaded.
The Second Renaissance Parts I & II-
This short shows the rise of the machines and the fall of humanity. The war and everything that led up to it. Second Renaissance has plenty of CG parts which is to be expected from the people who brought you Blue Submarine No. 6.  Although this time the CG and drawn animation actually blend well together. A thing that contradicts the movies in this is that it says everything is from the Zion database but in the first film they said they didn't know who struck first but Second Renaissanc says who did. Maybe they actually found out who knows. Anyway this is another one of the great films that you'll watch over and over and over and...
Kid's Story-
This is the only other film that relates to The Matrix Reloaded directly but you have to see the movie and pay attention to know how. Anywho this film is made by the Cowboy Bebop crew and has a new type of animation on it's side. The animation is made to look like the artists original sketch just with color but the thing is it takes twice as many cels to do it so don't say they were lazy. Overall another great film.
Program-
Thi is probably the most traditionally anime of the bunch. Created by the Ninja Scroll people this film is about a woman in a simulation who is forced to fight against her friend who is trying to go back to live in The Matrix. This one is very cool. The fighting is great and everything.
World Record-
This one was written by the guy behind Ninja Scroll, but was animated by Madhouse. The animation is...odd, but creative at the same time. Unfortunately it's not that great. In fact I think it really [bad] especially the agents and the way they look. This will be one you won't care about but for maybe one minute so you can know what's happening.
Beyond-
This is about a girl who is trying to find her pet cat who wanders off into a haunted house. The haunted house is actually a glitch in the Matrix. The girl and some other kids go to the house and play because of all the weird things they can do like throwing a glass bottle to the ground and when it hits it breaks but freezes before hitting the ground and then fixes itself and comes back. An interesting short and worth your time
A Detective Story-
This is a cool film brought to you by the Cowboy Bebop people.  The film is about a private detective who's promises to get out of the business if the next person that calls is a suspicious husband.  Well the next person instead is a program(obviously) who wants him to find a hacker that goes by the alias Trinity. When he asks who he'll be working for he doesn;t recieve an answer and is about to hang up when he is given $800,000 which is put into his bank account and so it begins. A great film that you and everyone else should like.
Matriculated-
I'm not even going to waste my time explaining it's TERRIBLE!
Well that's all but make sure you check out the special features they're actually pretty awesome compared to other anime DVD's",1055894400,,3480,4.400621118012422

You can do what you want but i really enjoyed the animatrix.",1055808000,,393,4.184210526315789

The animation is superb with a few exceptions such as ""World Record"" which I just found annoying to look at. (what exactly happened there anyway?) But the stories are much too short. Before you can even get a feel for where you are you're pulled out. Perfect examples of this are ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" which was beautifully done, and ""Detective Story"" which could have explained itself better. All in all the material feels truncated and the viewer is left feeling slightly ripped off. It was a great idea to delve deeper into the world of the matrix this way..but in my opinion it could have been so much better.",1055808000,,699,4.555555555555555
1850801,3,B00008LDPV,"The rest are kinda junky though. Cartoons and par Anime. Though they do fill in several holes of the story:
 The first AI servant to react violently (by killing his masters) is put on trial for all the world to see and convicted, setting off the Andro-cide apocalypse. Where all artificial workers are laid waste and bulldozed into mass graves. Some AI's escape and form a new country. Attempts are made to join the U.N., and the humans try to nuke'em, then blanket the sky so they can't get solar energy.
So, a few holes are filled in, and again the first one is true eye candy. A ship and crew go to the surface and see the machines digging with an army of sentinels, lying in wait. Our main character is trying to get a message to Zion before the ship gets squished. A really cool short story, probably alone worth it.
One story in particular was really violent probably not for kids under 8. People screaming bloody murder as their bodies are ripped apart by the ruthless machines.",1055721600,,985,4.472222222222222
1850802,3,B00008LDPV,"I felt this would be the end-all and be-all of anime, I should have been a little more realistic. The stop-and-go nature of all the films can be annoying and there are big gaps in between features. Most are disconnected from films and only two are a continuation. I suppose my favourite was 'Matriculated', it's the most appealing to me, visually. The plot ideas are mildly cool, these are mostly about projecting big ideas onscreen through animation. The main feature lasts about an hour and twenty minutes, the rest is unentertaining but deep background or ads for other Matrix products.
  It would definitely make a better rental than 20 dollar purchase. None of the shorts were given enough time to really flesh out many ideas, there are advantages to this, but you can't get attached to any characters or ideas much, and it doesn't flatter their hard work. I felt that the Second Renaissance 1-2 compiled a backhistory of the Matrix very nicely, but maybe some of that should have been explained better in the films, instead of Lock getting a stupid bracelet from his girlfriend to represent 'faith'.",1055721600,,1105,4.841269841269841
1850803,3,B00008LDPV,"While ""The Animatrix"" is not an unprecedented masterpiece, it is a splendid compliation and worth the money.
Onto the short reviews:
Final Flight of the Osiris:  The most amazing CGI on the disc, but short on story--We meet characters, something bad happens, said characters die.
Program:  This short does not tie into the movie story lines, but the artwork and fast paced action make it worth a look.
Detective Story: This short, from the creator of Cowboy Bebob, is a great noir short, and wholly unexpected in this type of compliation.
Kid's Story:  Eh.  While it does give some backstory to a throwaway character in ""Reloaded"", the bizzare artwork and dragging story knock this short down a peg.
Matriculated:  This one is kinda intresting, if a little psychedelic in the CGI sequences.  This film from the creator of ""Aeon Flux"" shows how the human resistance recruits robots to their side: by placing them in a human-desgined matrix portraying an idyllic existence showcasing humans as saviours.
Beyond:  Oy vey.  Utterly boring tale about a girl, her cat, and a Matrix programming anomaly turned haunted house. But not as bad as...
World Record:  ... God-awful tripe about a world record sprinter who frees himself from the Matrix by RUNNING FAST.  If it weren't for this and Beyond, I would give the disc five stars.
The Second Reninsance, Parts I & II:  The best of the bunch.  This tale showcases the advent of AI, their subsequent revolt, the formation of a robot nation-state, the machines attempt at reconiliation, and the final war between man and machine.  Haunting, bleak, and pure genius.
Final Verdict:  Skip ""Beyond"" and ""World Record"", and enjoy what some of anime's best talent has to offer in a familiar milieu.",1055635200,,1733,4.931034482758621
1850804,5,B00008LDPV,"Abslutely amazing. I think it is even better then Reloaded. All of the stories are deep and intresting, and the animation is top notch. For all those matrix fans out there, if you want to know a lot of background, this is a great source.

1850805,4,B00008LDPV,"A near excellent compilation of nine animated shorts taking place in The Matrix universe, The Animatrix is definitely worth owning if your a fan of Warner Bros. cash cow series.  Starting off with Final Flight of the Osiris (which also saw time in theaters debuting before the film adaptation of Stephen King's Dreamcatcher), an excellently computer animated (by the folks from Square Pictures who did Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within) short serving as a prequel to the events in The Matrix Reloaded and the Enter the Matrix video game.  The animation is excellent and has sure come a long way since the Final Fantasy film.  The Second Renaissance Parts 1&2 show the beginning of the war between man and machine and the creation of the Matrix.  These shorts are a great backstory to the Matrix saga, and although it may seem a bit silly at first, it becomes quite chilling.  Kid's Story also serves as a prequel to The Matrix Reloaded; as we learn the origin of the young teen who was following Neo around in the film thanking him for saving him.  Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss reprise their respective roles as voice overs in this short.  Program features a kabuki-warrior themed fight simulation which is directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri of Ninja Scroll fame.  World Record (which is written by Kawajiri) features an Olympic track runner who seems to get faster and faster, while Beyond features a group of kids discovering a ""haunted"" house which allows them to do almost anything such as hang in the air and they soon have a run in with the Agents.  Detective Story is presented similar to old style film noir movies, and also features a voice over cameo from Moss, while the final short Matriculated, finds a machine seemingly turning over a new leaf on humanity.  All in all, The Animatrix is a great companion piece to any fan of the feature film series, and it shows some of the top names in anime in great form.",1055635200,,1922,4.71044776119403
1850806,4,B00008LDPV,"To my fellow basement dwellers, and Matrix plug-ins...
I strongly recommend ANIMATRIX -- some awesome shorts, with different, but sweet range of the new CG stuff/animation!  Must be some independent filmmakers drippin on acid directed these things.
It really ties a bunch on loose facts and actually make the Matrix plausible.  You know, the ""ONE"" concept, and the ZION (underground city undetected, yea).  OK here goes a short out-take to interest you.
Part I -- the the movie AI,  Man develops arificial intel and it starts to think.  All that Asic Asminov, stuff on artificial ""feelings"".  But now the oppression by man turns those basic machine feelings into ""less pure thoughts"" and war begins.
Part II --  Think T2 - Judgment Day -- in the war machines prove too much for humans.  So what do they do --> boom out come the nukes.  Only think is, who survives the nuclear winters easier...machines don't sweat the temp and the radiation, just the lack of solar energy.  Good war stuff.
Part III - think Core - well, kind of.  Now a small group of men's best and brightest left come up with the only plan they can think --- tunnel down at least 20,000 ft and build a shelter/bio- dome (soon to become Zion).  Detonate all that's left, let all the radiation in and smoke the machines.  Yea, it sucks, but we'll be wiped out anyway and let's go down swingin.
Part IV - nay,I'll leave the rest for you to see, but trust me, they're good.

1850807,5,B00008LDPV,"It was violent, insane, graphic and in some parts grotesque.  I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.  This is what animation should be like in america, not that junk they show you on Cartoon Network or The WB.  The dvd has 9 short films about The Matrix, not the movie but the place (although 4 of the films are tangled into the first 2 matrix films, Final Flight of the Osiris, The Second Renaissance I & II and Kid's story).  I'll be rating the films individualy, as in Amazon.com the highest score is 5 stars, lets begin.
1. The first film ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" tells you who sent Jada Pinket Smiths character the info about the machines digging in ""The Matrix: Reloaded"".  All CGI, great animation and great story (5 stars).
2. The Second Renaissance I and II- This tells the story of how the machines came into power.  This is the one that is graphic and not really for kids but I let my 5 and 10 year old cousins see it and they seemed to like it.  What they didn't understand I explained to them and it sounds like most of you people who didn't like this DVD need to come over to my house so I can explain all of these 'simple to understand if your above 10 years old' plots for you. Great animation and great story (5 stars for both).
3. Kids Story-  It's about a teen that knows there's something more out there.  He knows about Neo, Trinity and the rest but he doesn't know how to get to them.  I liked the action on the skateboard and the kind of animation they used was new to me, I had not seen animation like that before (5 stars).
4. Program- A women is in a training program and her Boyfriend enters, telling her that he is tired of living in the real world.  He tells her that he knows a way back to the Matrix and asks her to come along.  Kind of like the Cypher character in the first Matrix movie.  When she declines, he decides not to take no for an answer.  He then decides if she's not leaving with him then shes not leaving the program alive.  Cool story and great fight scenes (5 stars).
5. World Record- A man entering a race in the Olympics races to beat the world record.  But as he races on he wakes up in and out of the Matrix and the real world.  The Agents around him do there best to keep him in the real world, going so far as to destroying all the muscles in his legs making him unable to walk again.  Great animation and a pretty neat premise (5 stars).
6. Beyond- A girl looking for her cat in her neighborhood finds an abandoned house which gives her and some neighborhood children special powers (floating, breaking and repairing a glass bottle, seeing rain fall were there are no clouds).  The premise of the story is that the house is basicly a glich in the Matrix and soon Agents come to fix this glich.  It was ok and the animation was pretty good too but there was something about this film that I just didn't like, I don't know why, maybe it was just to cutesie for me (I'd say between 3 and 3 1/2 stars)
7. A Detective Story-  The Agents are having trouble finding a hacker named Trinity, so they hire the services of a local P.I.  So far three Investigators have tried looking for her.  One killed himself, one went insane and the other vanished into thin air.  It's gotta 1940's feel to it (like a Humphrey Bogart movie) and it's all in black and white (some color).  It's like a 40's period piece but the charcters use todays technology.  I liked the script and the black and white went well with the feeling of the film.  Also great animation and I love 1940's period type films (5 stars).
And finally 8. Matriculated- Some people in the real world take down and capture a machine sent to hunt and destroy.  They then take the machine and download it and them selves into an alternite reality (kind of like a Matrix for Machines) to try and convince it to join them in their fight.  The animation has a weird feeling to it in the alternate wolrd sequence and it is a little creepy and I still don't really get the ending (I had to watch it a few times before I understood most of it, I think the machine falls in love with one of the girls) but I did like the tribute to Warner Bros. cartoons (you'll know it when you see it).  It was well made and had great looking machines (3 to 3 1/2 stars).
There are only commentaries for four of the films, The Second Renaissance I and II, Program and World Record.  There's a feature called ""From Scrolls to Screen"", it's basicaly about the history of anime.  The Creators feature are Bios about the creators of the films (directors, script writers, etc.) and the Execution feature gives you a film about the individual director and script writer of the movie they made.  They also give you a glimps of the ""Enter the Matrix"" video game.  You can also put this in your dvd-rom for more features.
So if you enjoy Anime and The Matrix then I suggest you buy this DVD.  If you don't like Anime, you just might after you see these films (DVD- 5 STARS).",1055548800,,4935,4.247323340471092
1850808,5,B00008LDPV,"I wasn't expecting much from this DVD after suffering through the horrible ""Director's Cut""-style editing of ""Matrix: Reloaded"" (despite the Wachowsky brothers' enthusiasm for Japanese anime, they have not caught on to the philosophy of minimalism).  However, I feel that they have redeemed themselves with this creative effort through their favorite medium - anime.
What is so brilliant about this collection?  It would help to remember all the movie-based cartoons that were aired on TV.  The animators were restricted to plots that were solely made to market the franchise (do you remember any Star Wars based cartoon that left any impresson on you?).  The results were invariably a derivative of the live-action original.  Instead, the brothers respectfully allowed each producers to interpret their world in the producer's own style.  The result is simply amazing - the collection's central theme is a framework rather than restriction, and the creativity and the skills of these animators really shine through.
The collection is good for the most part.  There are some weak points:  Matriculated relied too much on visual elements that were better told in spoken words (besides, robots do understand words and reason, don't they?  And so does the audience).  Detective Story was stylish but got choppy and was hastily ended at the scene on the train.  The Program was the most disappointing, with many repeating visual elements that points to lack of effort, and the quality falls far short of the producer's earlier work, ""Cowboy Bebop"".  The rest is okay.
The most outstanding work is ""The Second Renaissance I & II"".  It deals with the one of the main theme of the Matrix series - the fraility of human kind.  The compressed imagery has the pace of an Osamu-styled (a la ""The Phoenix"") manga - many of the scenes are taken from our recent history but re-styled for cohesive storytelling.  This will explain why many young viewers will not understand the message that is conveyed by the choice of imagery.
Also, the origins of the idea of interdependence of man and machine (also presented in Matrix2) is presented as the rational extension that follows the miseries brought on by both sides - an idea that confused many revieweres here.
As far as violent nature of the imageries goes - since many images are re-take of the actual events in human history (just replace humans with robots), it is far from gratuitous and it is meant to get your hands dirty.  I would understand that children and the undereducated will have a hard time understanding this.  That said, just take it easy and enjoy the ride, this is simply an entertainment!",1055548800,2,2645,4.988610478359909
1850809,3,B00008LDPV,"The Animatrix is a collection of nine animations commissioned and produced by the Matrix writer-directors Larry and Andy Wachowski. The animations vary from fairly simple ""A Detective Story"" to state-of-the-art ""The Last Flight of the Osiris.
I found the collection of animations to be quite interesting -- both from an artistic point of view and from a storyline point of view. Even though ""A Detective Story"" is the least sophisticated piece technique-wise, I found the story the most enjoyable. The realism of ""The Last Flight"" was just incredible. ""The Second Renaissance"" and ""Kids Story"" give a lot of background to the Matrix storyline.
This DVD is great for fans of ""The Matrix"" looking for additional background as well as people who like animation. Those like me (who found ""The Matrix Reloaded"" a bit long in the tooth) will most likely find the DVD just OK. If you haven't seen ""The Matrix"", then skip this DVD.
There isn't much in the way of DVD extras - only some director's commentary for a few of the animations. The one I watched had English subtitles. Interesting, if you have the time to watch but it didn't do much for me.
Recommend: Yes to Matrix/Animation fans

If the next all CGI movie is as good as ""The Last Flight of the Osiris"", then I cannot wait to see it. The other short films are all as good or better than the Osiris story.
This is what I would call ""Essential"" viewing.",1055462400,,361,4.246376811594203
1850811,4,B00008LDPV,"Personally, I love the Animatrix, and I believe the Wachowski brothers repay a large debt of gratitude and creative license to the Japanese animation industry by exposing so many talented animators and directors through this collection.
However, those hoping to get all of their Matrix-universe questions answered before the release of ""Matrix: Revolutions"" may be sorely disappointed by this showcase.  Although some short films provide backstory (more in the descriptions below), they are also standalone pieces.  The strength of this collection is in the strength of its contributors, and it provides a diverse cross-section of modern Japanese anime which will give the uninitiated an opportunity to see what's being produced.
The short films in the collection are:
""Final Flight of the Osiris"" - This short produced by Square (also the production company for some of the best video games of the past decade, and the ""Final Fantasy"" film) provides an almost creepy example of ""digital actors"" whose skin texture, bounce and movement are nearly impossible to distinguish from the real thing.  Only their lip sync gives it away.  The story involves the captain and pilot of the Osiris, the doomed ship which (in the Reloaded timeline) sends the warning to Zion that the machines are digging.  It is also a direct introduction to the ""Enter the Matrix"" video game, as it depicts the drop of the letter which Niobe or Ghost must retrieve from a post office in the first act of the game.
""The Second Renaissance, Parts I and II"" - If one can overlook the fact that more information is contained in this ""Zion Archive file"" than Morpheus told Neo the humans knew, these two short films provide a compelling and lushly illustrated history of the fall of humanity and the rise of the machines.  In particular, the fluid art style and the haunting voice-over make this an easy 18 minutes to spend, and it invokes more sympathy for the machines than you'll get from the human-centric viewpoint of the Matrix films.
""Program"" is the weakest film in the series; mercifully, it is short.  Although the animation style is as classic in the world of anime as ""Snow White"" is in the world of Disney, the story line is weak.  I enjoy this more if I turn down the sound and just watch.
""World Record"" attempts to illustrate what happens to a human in the Matrix whose desire to accomplish something physically pushes him to the brink of the reality he thinks he knows.  The art design is not for everyone, but is beautifully realized with tremendous detail in every cell.  The music is also a plus.  This won't add much to your ""Matrix IQ"" but is a very creative exploration of what happens to people whose minds are not freed by the Zionists, and who do not find their way out through a computer.
""Kid's Story"" is one of my two favorites on the disc.  It ties into ""Matrix: Reloaded"" by telling us how the annoying kid in Zion came to know and love Neo.  It's no secret to those who have seen the film that the kid ""self-substantiates"", or gets himself out of the Matrix without help.  His journey to that point, though, is detailed in a lush, deliberately-paced, gorgeously-scored piece of animation that will leave you breathless. One of two films directed by Shinichiro Watanabe of ""Cowboy Bebop"" fame.
""Beyond"" - Koji Morimoto (an assistant animator on the legendary ""Akira"") turns in the most inventive and beautiful short piece of the disc.  It takes a simple question - what would happen if the Matrix's physical rules malfunctioned in some locations? - and explores the answer, from the bizarre physical happenings that children call hauntings to the arrival of futuristic wrecking equipment that razes and rewrites the affected locale.  This, along with ""Kid's Story"", makes the DVD worth the price of admission.
""Detective Story"" - this black-and-white second entry from director Shinichiro Watanabe plays like a Sam Spade film.  Its comic book style is stark and beautiful, and the addition of Carrie-Anne Moss's voice really grounds it in the Matrix universe.  At the end of the day the story doesn't matter much, but it's an enjoyable nine minutes all the same.
""Matriculated"" - Peter Chung (of Aeon Flux) shows a real flair here for art, but tells a somewhat convaluted story of humans who try to get machines to ""choose"" to betray their own kind.  My complaint with this piece is not its technical execution, which is brilliant and shows that Chung dedicated himself to improving an already great talent, but rather in its plot.  Like ""Program"", watch this one for the art.",1055462400,3,4574,4.8622908622908625

1850813,5,B00008LDPV,"The Animatrix is one of the best anime films I've ever seen.  It's nine segments are all intriguing, plunging you further into the world of The Matrix.  The first four segments are based on the story written by the Wachowski brothers, the remaining five are simply random tales from the mythology of The Matrix.
FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS - Visually stunning (can we expect anything less from SquareSoft?) and an integral part of The Matrix story...especially if you've played the Enter The Matrix video game.
THE SECOND RENAISSANCE PART I AND II - An in-depth look at how machines took over the world.  It's in-your-face violence and depiction adds a huge impact on the story.
KID'S STORY - Remember the young kid in Matrix Reloaded that Neo saved?  This is his story.  It's animation style is reminiscent of the film Waking Life and features the voice of Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss.
PROGRAM - A very short piece involving a sparring program.  The animation style is traditional anime.
WORLD RECORD - Not my favorite, but still an alright story of a runner who accidentally discovers the matrix while trying to break a world record.
BEYOND - There's a house where the program of the matrix is not entirely stable and some kids enjoy the effects of this glitch.  Very cute story.
A DETECTIVE'S STORY - An agent hires a private eye within the matrix to find a hacker called Trinity.  A very dark style.  Also features Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity.
MATRICULATED - This is my absolute favorite.  Some rebels try to convince some machines to defect to the human side by jacking them in to a human-generated program.  The visuals in this segment are breathtaking and trippy.  This is from the animators of Aeon Flux.
Overall, a great DVD.  Bad-[rear] soundtrack and better-than-average surround sound.  The picture quality is crystal-clear.  If you have a 16:9 TV or even just component video hooked up this will be a fantastic ride.  Enjoy!",1055376000,,1942,4.8217522658610275

1850815,4,B00008LDPV,"A lot of other reviewers have already commented on how the Wachowski Brothers borrow heavily from anime and manga to create The Matrix. They now complete the circle with The Animatrix.
THE ANIMATRIX is a series of short animated films from several Japanese anime directors (and a couple of American ones as well). I call attention to the now 15+ year old ROBOT CARNIVAL, which is a Japanese movie composed of a series of animated short pieces strung together by the narrative hook of robots. Perhaps not surprisingly, there is an overlap as Kouji Morimoto directed bits for both films (""Franken's Gear"" in Robot Carnival and ""Beyond"" in The Animatrix).
The Animatrix does succeed in extending Matrix universe by allowing other creative minds to play with the setting. ""Final Flight of the Orsiris"", essentially a prologue to Matrix Reloaded, is from the creators of the beautifully rendered but soul-less Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. As the closest thing to ""film"" in The Animatrix, it makes for a nice bridge between this animated and the theatrical release. (Okay, I admit I wasn't sure if they were CG-characters or rotoscoped at first.) As animation, it is nothing new or special.
My favorites of the short films are ""The Second Renaissance"", Parts I and II. There is some filling of the backstory on the history of Men and Machines. It also makes the best use of anime as a mirror for reality. Another piece I really liked was ""Matriculated"" from Aeon Flux creator Peter Chung. The idea of humans kidnapping and reprogramming machines by seducing them with fleshy pleasures is the closest The Animatrix come to extending (and inverting) the metaphor of the Matrix.
The other story which is most scifi is ""Beyond"". Here, in a glitch in the Matrix creates a ""haunted house"" in the midst of a Tokyo (?) burb. It is also the most fantastical story with a classic (cliche?) twist ending. For me, ""Beyond"" is childlike and plain delightful.
""Kid's Story"" and ""World Record"" are cool enough vignettes of other humans in the Matrix. Stylistically, they very much echo anime conventions. They don't add new understanding to the Matrix, however.
The one piece that could have and should have dealt with the whole ""blue pill/red pill"" dichotomy is ""Program"". Here, a recruit is tempted by her trainer/handler to return to the Matrix. It could have been an interesting extension of humans choosing between the discomfort of reality vs the faux-paradise of the Matrix. Instead, ""Program"" is merely a battle between two humans. Thus ""Program"" is merely an animated rendering of a film apeing anime conventions. (Echoes of Scary Movie/Scream/teen slasher movies, anyone?)",1055376000,,2667,5.022573363431151
1850816,5,B00008LDPV,"The Animatrix was always something I intended to pick up, but after I had more cash. While I love the Matrix, the semi-disappointment of Matrix Reloaded and the over-barrage of media hype that came with it made me want to lay off anything Matrix-related for awhile. But when I found the Animatrix for an exceptionally low price, I decided to snatch it up now rather than pay more later. And I'm glad I did.
I've browsed the other reviews here and a lot of anime/DVD sites, and can understand how the hardcore anime community might dislike the Animatrix. Some really bad dialogue seems to creep in now and then, and there are probably a lot more than the few anime cliches I picked up on (the feudal Japan training sim in the short ""Program"" is the most blatent one). However, this release still blew me away. For someone whose anime experience has been limited to watered-down American dubs like Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, and Ultimate Muscle, the animation in these shorts is jaw-dropping. Mind-blowing. Certain art styles fans will like more than others, but all of them have the high detail of anime AND the fluidity of American animation. It's the best of both cultures, and like the old saying goes, ""I never knew it could be this way."" On a side note, also to be commended is ""Final Flight of the Osiris"", the non-anime short that uses the ""Final Fantasy"" CGI graphics. I never saw Final Fantasy, and while the animation here was incredible, it still looked CG to me. However, certain shots of the main character(the Asian girl) looked so real I'd have sworn she was a live actor. Kudos to Square for making me believe.
As for the quality of the actual stories, I agree with the majority in that the four outstanding ones are Osiris, Second Renaissance I and II, and Detective Story. The others are open to a bit more criticism, and will each have their share of supporters and detractors, but I enjoyed all of them, and find that all the shorts are worth owning. Some great supplements are included too, including commentaries and an informative documentary on the history of anime. Either way, there's enough good stuff here for all anime fans to justify adding it to their collection. And if you love the Matrix, but think of anime only in terms of Pokemon, then I highly recommend you snag this eye-opening disc; you'll never view anime the same way again.",1055289600,,2358,4.670673076923077

If you are an anime freak, than this may be something to add to your collection when the price drops. But if you are looking to get a real feel for the Matrix story background, seek alternative sources. Before I jumped on the bandwagon and clicked buy, I should have had a better sense of what I was getting. I wanted something that would go over the FULL past of the Matrix, i.e. the first surviors and the founding of Zion. But the only story that even seemed in line to what I thought I was getting was the first chapter, the final flight...which I watched last because of a button mishap. Before viewing that I was crushed! This is definitely a rent first, or borrow DVD. I'm not sure how you can ride the fence about this one. You either liked it or hated it.

Renasaunce 1 and 2 give you a brilliant look into how the machines took control of the world and the terrifying horrors that mankind had to face due to his selfish mistakes.  Kids story gives you the accout of how Neo saved the young guy (forgot his name) in reloaded.  all of the animation is different and so gives you a feast for the sences as the stories go from a computer generated master peice to the swirling, tripped out imigry in kid story which is symbolic of the matrixes non-reality.  if you enjoyed the matrix and the rest of the movies this will definately be worth a look, if you haven't seen reloaded yet WATCH THIS! it's basicaly all you need to know before watching the movie to not be confused a certain points.",1055289600,,1146,4.3023255813953485

1850820,4,B00008LDPV,"You know, if George Lucas had had a similar idea there would be more than a few who would eagerly relish snippets of various happenings in the world of Star Wars. Of course the origins of Lucas' epic trilogy (and not so epic prequels) were not based in Japanese, post-apocalyptic anime as with the Wachowski Bros. Who wouldn't want more glimpses into the world of The Matrix? As with any intriguing movie, the fans want more, more, more. And more is what you get here in The Animatrix.
Of course, one can only stand so much gun-slinging, wire-working, kung-fu fight scenes. And if the producers of The Matrix had endeavored to feed us another helping of that it would surely taste bland. So, they treat us to some of the best animation directors on the planet and even allow various writers to collaborate on 5 of the 9 projects (the other 4 the brothers W. wrote themselves).
Read the other reviews if you want a break-down of each episode...of course I liked some better than others. Regardless, I really appreciate being exposed to each of these different types of animation. Each of them are compelling to me. I've viewed the various shorts several times as well as some of the extra features and I know I'll keep coming back to them, as the imagery is spectacular. Even if I really love a DVD, I rarely watch it more than once per year or so...it's too time consuming. With this one, I can simply watch one at a time and ponder the implications.

1850822,3,B00008LDPV,"The Animatrix was a film of extremes. From the most advanced in animation (""Final Flight of the Osiris"") to the most primitive (""World Record""), from complete ingenuity (""Matriculated"") to manipulative idiocy (both ""Second Renaissance"" segments). Yet you can still some up the whole thing in one word: BLEAK.
Props to the various animators for creating an interesting variety of features. From the sketchy, amoeba-like characters in ""Kid's Story"" to the picture perfect CGI of ""Final Flight,"" the film has certainly utilized the strengths of a superior tangent of animators. 2/3 of the segments are very similar in style to such anime classics as ""Ghost in the Shell,"" ""Metropolis,"" and ""Ninja Scroll"" (duh), while a third are uncategorizable.
As for story. Most of these are just eye candy with LOTS of pseudo-scientific dialogue to make people think their brain cells AREN'T being destroyed by the thousands. At least 2/9 of the film got it right.
The first is in ""Kid's Story."" Using a unique animation style, the segment lets the imagery speak for itself. It chronicles the plight of a confused boy, who thinks life is more real when he dreams than when awake. It ends with a bit which ""Reloaded"" hints at. The Second is ""Matriculated"" (which, ironically enough, has the most eye candy of the lot). The story, involving freed humans' desire to convert a machine to their side, is thought provoking and ultimately tragic. Both segments follow a refreshing pattern: Replacing pretentious narratives and stupid dialogue for pure spectacle.

1850826,5,B00008LDPV,"I really, really enjoyed the Animatrix.  I am both a fan of anime and a fan of the Matrix and its sequel but I really think you need not be either to appreciate this package.
The films obviously owe a debt to the storytelling devices and concepts that have been coming our of anime for years from Ghost in the Shell on, equally the films rely heavily on a video game inspired sensibility so it is my understanding that the directors put in equal time and energy to ancillary packages of anime as well as video games, that support and tie in with the films as well as stand alone as significant entries in their own genres.
I don't have a Playstation, so i can't vouch for the video game, but I've read some of the reviews for the Animatrix and I think people are missing the point.  I don't think it's meant to be the Matrix Reloaded broken down and reformatted, nor are the stories meant to be direct support structures to the film.
The Animatrix (as we have been told) is a collection of nine shorts which are basically riffs on the premise that the Matrix puts forward.  Some are more straightforward (a second renaissance parts 1 & 2, for example, supplies a dispassionate history of the machine persecution and revolt that ultimately led to the supplication of humans as the dominant life form of the planet.  The art  is clean and the machines are reminiscent of what you may have seen in ""Metropolis"".  Although, ostensibly supplying background information that fills in the blanks that movie did not have time to elaborate on, to consider it just a primer for the movie sells it short.  It is beautifully animated and moving, specifically scenes of machine torture, riot and images of violence that deliberately recall some of the more disturbing images of this century.  Both sides of the conflict are reflected in an objective and honest (if sometimes harsh) light.  Perhaps it is because of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of the second world war, but Japanese animation in particular seems to have an eerie conscience in regards to rubble strewn devastation and bombed out cities and their aftermath and this has been the sharpest contrast when you compare their films on these subjects (Grave of the Fireflies, for example, or Jin-Roh) to our own.  There is a sense of conscience, grief and a tendecy not towards valor, but rather towards regret and responsibility that infuses the storytelling in this short in particular beyond just being background filler.
Other shorts take aspects not presented in the film but suggested by it and develop them.  In 'Matri(x)culated'  a team of humans capture machines and re-program them (with hallucinatory, almost religious imagery ) to aid in the conflcit aganst their own kind.  'Beyond' (my personal fav'rite) explores the idea of a glitch in the matrix which evidences itself as a series of localised , bizarre phenomenon which a bunch of neighborhood kids believe to be a haunted house.
You don't even need to have particularily liked the matrix or its follow up to enjoy these shorts.  What you have is a collection of shorts  by some of the most impressive animators currently working, commisioned with a large budget and creative freedom and the result is pretty spectacular.  The animation is some of the best I've seen, ""Program"" picks up with the moody atmospheres that dominated ""Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust"".  ""A  Detective Story"" uses a monochromatic style that looks partially like watercolor washes, partially like newspaper photographs, and partially like sepia toned photographs to create a visual style that compliments both the noir-ish aspects of the film as well as it's techno driven frenzy.  ""Matri(x)culation"" has a sequence of beautiful if cypherish images that are dreamlike and hypnotic, sort of like one of those ""beyond the mind's eye"" videos used to illustrate a symbolic allegory.  Some of the shorts are slightly more stylised (""kids story"" and ""World Record"") and ""Flight of the Osiris""  is the hyper-realistic CGI work that you may have seen in ""Final Fantasy"".  Each story is well told and slight, more like a tone poem, which suits the idea of being a collection, each one relating to the story that came before it and to the one that will follow it, supported by,  but not dependent on the greater story arc.
If you have seen or appreciated any fine animated films like Spirited Away, Metropolis, Ghost in the Shell, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, Jin-Roh, or of course, Akira, then there is something here for you to enjoy.",1055203200,2,4531,4.840673575129534

There are plenty of good plot summaries out there, so read those if you want a synopsis of the DVD, but let me just say that I thought the ""First Rennaisance Part I and II"" were awesome and crucial to an understanding of The Matrix.  I was glued to the screen.  ""Program"" blew my mind, and is probably my favorite.  ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" is beautiful and a little racy--great, nonetheless--and is mentioned in the Matrix:  Reloaded.  I thought that was pretty cool.  And ""Kid's Story"" is also essential to understanding one of the characters in Reloaded.  ""Matriculated"" was a little strange, but I highly enjoyed the other episodes.

1850829,4,B00008LDPV,"This is a very tricky piece to review.  I'm actually torn between three and four stars but I put four simply because of the awesome animation.
The first thing that came to my mind while I watched these short films was that I felt like I was at an independent film festival.  This can be a good or bad thing depending on whether or not you're open to independent type films which can be wierd yet amazing at the same time.
However, overall, I can truthfully say I did enjoy this Dvd.  It was kind of like being on a rollercoaster since the stories seemed to change so fast and were only about nine or ten minutes each.  The only problem with this was the fact that each story seemed very rushed and by the time you felt the slightest bit of attatchment to the characters or plot (or even figured out finally what the plot was) it was over and you were on to next episode.
There were actually only about two episodes I did not like and one I was very uncertain about.  I wasn't fond of Detective Story because it seemed to be building to something and when it got there, it just fell and then stopped.  However, once again, the art was amazing! I've never seen anime in all gritty blacks, whites and grays before and it was really cool to look at.
I also didn't like Matriculated mostly because aside from the interesting concept it presented of trying to sway a machine into joining the human side, it was a major let down at the end.  In my opinion, stories that end in simply death are too lazy to think of a more creative way to save their characters.  Its much easier to kill of people than to save them.
World Record is one I'm not certain about.  I liked the idea and the anime was interesting but the way it was presented was somewhat strange.  I really think they could have gone about it better. It's showing someone surpassing their limits and therefore breaking out of the matrix by accident.  Hovever, once again, we're left with a ending that leaves you angry.
The Final Flight of the Osiris was very entertaining and I loved the Computer Graphics.  You feel a great deal for the two main characters and it acts as sort of a trailer to the Matrix Reloaded.
Program was a wonderful short story with beautiful character designs and great fight scenes.  It deals with the tempation of going back to the Matrix and returning to a life of ignorant bliss.
Beyond was cool mostly for the animation and the way they represented the Matrix and how messed up things could be.  The focal point is a house that appears to be a glitch or defective spot in the matrix world.  A teenage girl and a few kids stumble upon it and find they can do amazing things there because they believe it's ""haunted"".
Kid's Story was probably one of my favorites.  The story is thrilling and shows an escape from the matrix world.  The art is very unique and has a squiggled, sketchy quality that gives the impression of motion,speed and anxiety. I found it very interesting.
The Second Renaissance parts one and two are also my favorites.  They tell the past and explain how the machines rose up against the humans in the first place.  These are extremely interesting and thought provoking, dealing with many psychological issues as well.
All in all, I did like this DVD and I'm glad I purchased it.  The episodes I liked far outweighed the ones I didn't and the entire package is a feast for the eyes.",1055203200,,3384,4.409967845659164

Nothing of substance occurred and there seemed to be no point to many of them.  Much like the Enter the Matrix video game (which I also own and am disappointed with), the Animatrix felt like a cheap grab for more of my money.  It seemed hastily written and slapped together just to squeeze out a few more bucks from me.  While I sort of liked Matrix Reloaded, I think the release of that movie coupled with the video game and the animated stories was overly commercial and really diminished my enthusiasm for Revolutions and my overall opinion of the Matrix storyline.

1850836,5,B00008LDPV,"The real trick of the Animatrix collection is how it tries to stealthily introduce an American audience to some of the stunning animation work developed from Japan's anime tradition.  Or so it may have been envisioned when the project started.  The award-winning ""Spirited Away"" may have already gone a long way towards revealing to American audiences that Japanimation does not end with Pokemon.  Animatrix expounds on this, bringing more of an American storytelling element and presumably making the dazzling imagry more relevant to an American audience.
To be honest, though, I found some of the stories submitted by the anime directors to be the most intriguing and engaging.  Not that it all falls apart, either.  Each of the 8 stories feels very distinctive, both in story and look.  As such, the disc not only serves fans of ""The Matrix"" by exploring aspects of its world not covered in the films, but also explores the anime tradition with such wonderful variety.  They short films are anything but a series (with the exception of a two-part episode) and this gives them each a freshness that is great for the viewer.
I especially enjoyed the two works by the man behind ""Cowboy Bebop"", Shinchiro Watanabe.  ""Kid's Story"" is astoundingly imaginative in visual presentation.  The ""hand-drawn"" look bleeding to distortion is not only great to look at, but propels the story forward.  I kept thinking of ""Waking Life"" and how it played with reality as this film progressed.  His other work ""A Detective Story"" is very reminsant of ""Cowboy Bebop"" without feeling derivative.  Playing with color and tone really establishes the feel of the piece.  The design of the characters and props, too, creates an appealing retro-future nevertime very appropriate for a story from within the Matrix.  Very clever work, all around.
My favorite, though, is ""Beyond.""  I simply cannot say enough about how stunningly artistic this film is.  In many way's, its story is the most simple and is really the only one to be told from a life within the Matrix without any intrusion of ""the real world"".  It is wildly imaginative in story and presenation, and you must see it for yourself.  It is realistic and magical at the same time.
""The Second Renaissance"" stories are interesting and really beg for a larger presentation.  I'd have loved to see the story told with twice the time, as I think it would lend greater impact to the savage violence we see in the second part of the story.  It is a fascinating mythology, and it does come across well here.  The animation is a bit self-consciously  inconspicuous if that makes any sense.  The story is definetly what is important here, but the visual seems to be trying to hard to not be noticed, as opposed to the seemlessness of the other episodes I mentioned.
The remaining episodes, however, are all about the visual and usually to their fault, I'm afraid.  It is hardly a horrible fault, but they do feel less cohesive.  ""Matriculated"" is the best of the remaining episodes.  From the creater of Aeon Flux (and believe me, you can tell), the visual is splashy and inventive and the play with color is supurb and important to the story.  My only complaint is that I don't think enough story was told.  Its a very intriguing concept, but a bit underdeveloped.
The same can be said for ""World Record.""  A nice idea, but it seems a little hollow here.  The visual presentation, however, makes up for it.  It is very impressionistic and individualistic and impressive.  I can't say the same for ""Program"", however, which is a shame because there is so little story here that it needed a powerful visual presentation to make the story.  Instead, it just drags and is my least favorite of the bunch.
Which leaves the much talked about ""Final Flight...""  I'm not that impressed.  Oh, sure, it is a wonderful technical achievement but as with the Final Fantasy movie, the characters don't seem alive which is a major problem when your animation is banking on its realism.  Its a major step forward, and the action scenes are engaging, but this ""photo-realistic"" style just seems like bells and whistles to me.  All style and no substance.  Especially in contrast to the wonderful living characters created by Pixar.  The studio would do well to employ more quality animators who have really developed an eye for the way people move and live.  I've seen many, many traditional animation characters that exhibit more life.  They just aren't living up to the promise of the technology.  It felt like all of the effort was poured into the animation here, and it just didn't come together for me.
The extras are nice.  Nothing of any enormous significance, but a solid compliment to the disk.  I would certainly recommend this DVD to anyone with an interest in ""The Matrix"" or in anime.",1055116800,2,4809,4.82640586797066
1850837,3,B00008LDPV,"While it's claimed that The Animatrix is a collection of nine animated tales that happen in and around the Matrix, it's really a collection of eight, as there's a two-parter that utilizes the same animation studio. I'll say one thing for it: it's pretty.
Actually, there's a lot of good animation to watch for the 100 or so minutes that The Animatrix goes on. However, it shares the same problem that most anime (and, indeed, The Matrix Reloaded) have: style but lack of substance. Most of the pieces within The Animatrix are visually appealing, but they lack any sense of coherence. They're scenes of story that just miss the mark of being stories themselves. There are exceptions to this within the film, but The Animatrix seems to be more an exercise of marketing and visualization than an envelope push of storytelling. This isn't Serial Experiments Lain or Cowboy Bebop-no matter how much it wishes it was.
Final Flight of the Osiris - Created by Square Studios, the animation geniuses behind Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, Final Flight is a photo-realistic CGI fight sequence. It's wonderful and amazing to watch, as it takes the beautiful CGI of Final Fantasy and kicks it up a notch. It's visually fantastic. Unfortunately, the story itself is half fight scene and half flight scene with a weak and fatalistic plot. In many ways, this was the perfect choice to open The Animatrix with, because of it's aesthetic qualities. It also lets the viewer know what they're getting into: style over substance.
The Second Renaissance (Part I & Part II) - This two-part animation sequence is directed by Mahiro Maeda (the man behind Robot Carnival and Macross: Do You Remember Love). The animation style is a great representation of classic ""Japanime"" and it's a pleasure to watch. Rather than being an actual story, Renaissance is a compiled history of the rise of the machines and how it [the Matrix] all came to be. It's an interesting take on how the Matrix came to be where it is by the time of the movie(s). While interesting, it manages to come across as a bit contrived, as if the Wachowski brothers (who wrote the segments) had another series in mind when beginning, but were forced to shove that series' history into that of The Matrix. I'm not sure what the desired effect of Renaissance was, but by the end I sympathized more with the machines than humanity.
Kid's Story - This story ties in directly with The Matrix Reloaded and features, briefly, the vocal talents (or lack thereof) of Keanu Reeves. While I didn't care for the animation style, I was glad that it wasn't simply ""more of the same."" It's the story about the Neo-worshiping boy from Reloaded. There seems to be an aspect of the story that is lacking, even with the knowledge gained from Reloaded about the character, there's still something missing within the story. It's a stylistic piece that lacked story and that missed the mark visually.
World Record - This is, quite possibly, the lowest point that The Animatrix falls. While I'm not a very big fan of the animation style used in, say, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, I don't necessarily hate it, either. Record uses a similar art style, but comes across as sloppier. The mish-mash story is about a runner who becomes aware of the Matrix because of his determination to succeed. Like The Second Renaissance, it doesn't interact well within the setting of the live-action movies.
Program - If you like animated fight scenes and don't care about story then this might be your favorite segment. This story is little more than a training simulation for a user. It's a drawn-out, feudal Japan-esche, fight scene that uses the context of the protagonist's lover (and sparring partner) trying to convince her to reinsert herself into the Matrix as it's (flimsy) plot backdrop. I found it to be the biggest yawn-fest in the film.
Detective Story - Shinichiro Watanabe, the man behind Cowboy Bebop, directs this pulp-detective, film-noir style tale about a man hired to find Trinity. It's interesting and aesthetically pleasing, but pushes the Through the Looking-Glass cliche a little too strongly and falls flat in the end. It's probably the biggest disappointment of the film, because it had the most potential. It's one of the few stories that would have worked and have been stronger with more time and outside the confines of trying to tie into another series.
Beyond - This is a simple story about what might happen in a ""bad sector"" of the Matrix's ""hard drive."" While a little bland, Beyond is the one of the better pieces in the film because it works perfectly with the context of the live-action movies and the Matrix ideology itself. It's also one of the only complete stories. It poses a question and answers it.
Matriculate - The final segment in The Animatrix is a story about a piece of the resistance that is attempting to sway machines to their cause, one by one. It's more animated acid trip than story, but it's fun to watch. The end of Matriculate, much like the end of the first piece (Final Flight of the Osiris) is a fatalistic downer, though.
Ultimately, The Animatrix is worth a look, but I don't know if it's worth purchasing. Unlike its multiple-story animated predecessors, it doesn't reach the depths that even Heavy Metal or Robot Carnival managed to go to. At least their stories were complete.",1055116800,,5349,4.815217391304348

The Stories themselves range from good to excellent and the acting is almost always subperb. Oh yeah, the picture quality and graphical style is either nice or totally, undenialbly, mind blowing!

Extras? The DVD has director bios, and full-length commentary for some, but not all of the shorts (both Renaissance films, Program and World Record). There's a trailer for the already out Enter the Matrix game, making-of documentaries on each film, and ""Scrolls to Screen: The History and Culture of Anime,"" which is a should see for any new or reasonably educated anime fan.
The art certainly ranges; Kid's Story (by Bebop director (Shinichiro Watanabe, who also does Detective Story) is extremely rough, much like A-ha's ""Take On Me"" video, while Beyond takes on a pastier, Perfect Blue-like appearance. Yoshiaki Kawajiri (of Ninja Scroll fame), gives anime fans some familiarity with ""Program,"" which is a crisper version of ""Ninja Scroll"" with the female lead even resembling Kagero.
How does the story deepen your ""Matrix knowledge/experience""? It varies. The ""Renaissance"" set gives a dose of history, of how everything came to be; ""Osiris"" is a near direct tie-in to the trilogy; ""Kid's Story,"" ""World Record"" and to an extent, ""Beyond"" show how normal people (the way Neo used to be) find other ways than being contacted via hacking, to be awakened to the real world. ""Program"" shows that there are other simulations similar to what Neo was put through, but with different time periods, and levels of reality (my personal favorite).
It's unrated, but violence is extremely graphic and hard to swallow at times; there are flashes of nudity, but not anything excessive, the same with love scenes or similar material. The stories aren't too complex to leave you scratching your head, but do expect a certain level of intelligence to put it all together.

Final Flight of the Osiris - the Final Fantasy team put together a superior piece on the brave final stand of the crew of the doomed hovercraft Osiris. I loved Final Fantasy - Spirits Within, therefore I was expecting a lot from this piece and I was not disappointed. If only swordplay was more realistic (I don't care whether you're in the Matrix or not, some things in a sword fight work, while some things never work).
The Second Renaissance Parts 1&2 - Finally the history of the world leading into the Matrix series and most questions are answered. A good piece.
Kid's Story - Awesome, the second best of the lot, the animation is a little hard to get used to, but after two viewings it's pretty easy to take. The best story of the lot.
Program - The best. Ninja Scroll, Wicked City, Vampire Hunter D - Bloodlust and Goku - Mr Kawajiri's work speaks volumes. A great example of good anime (there is a lot of bad anime running around).
World Record - The most interesting story of the lot, but the animation style was difficult to take. I really wanted to like it.
Beyond - A good story, with great characters. It would have been really interesting if Studio Ghibli was given the reigns of this project. I've always been curious of effects of a couple of bad lines of code in the matrix.
A Detective Story - Trinity is always good, but this segment could have been much better.
Matriculated - Nothing against Peter Chung (Aeon Flux is one of the best characters in animation ever), but this segment is a prime example of highbrow intellectualising which left me disappointed.

Each short is presented differently and each one shines in its own particular/peculiar way. If you have the inclination to try a film that is beyond standard fare you should at least rent this title. I can say, however, that the two Parts of ""The Second Renaissance"" are among the most visceral films I have seen in some time, either animated or not. I could not get the images out of my head. Neither gratuitous nor exploitative, there are several uncomfortable scenes involving human vs. robot revolts, dismemberment, and/or mayhem which were as striking as they were disturbing, particularly a scene where you see several brawny men restraining what appears to be a human woman in a revealingly torn shirt. Shockingly, one of them wields a large pipe and bludgeons her with it, ripping the synthetic skin on her face and revealing her to be a robot. The viewer is shocked...should you be grateful that it was not a person who was brutalized, or should you still feel the horror? In short, it is beautifully animated and thought-provoking fare that will knock the socks off animation fans but will probably not appeal to most who are outside of the genre.

1850862,3,B00008LDPV,"The Animatrix is nine short animated films that tie into or branch off of the world created by the Wachowski brothers in three feature films.  Taken as a whole, this project can be described as a visual masterpiece decorating a very uneven set of stories.  It is a worthy buy for fans of animation, and for those of us who are simply fascinated with anything Matrix related, but if you are expecting any groundbreaking, knock your socks off revelations or storylines, you may be a bit disappointed.
The animation often achieves moments of breathtaking beauty and detail, and is refreshing in its variety from one short film to the next.  Styles vary from the ultra-realistic (Final Flight of the Osiris), to film noir (A Detective Story), to the truly bizarre and psychedelic (Matriculated).
As for the storylines, they are frequently vague and in serious need of fleshing out, and are for the most part not essential to any deeper understanding of the main story presented in the Matrix films.  For my taste, the three shorts that did relate directly to the film, Final Flight of the Osiris and The Second Renaissance Parts I and II were the most satisfying and the others were simply dessert after the main course.  All in all, every story with the exception of The Second Renaissance Parts I and II left me wanting more.  Perhaps that is a testament to what a story should do, or perhaps it is an example of an inability to pull a story completely together, depending on which point of view you choose to take.
Whatever the case may be, if you are only a casual fan of the Matrix films and could care less about the fine art of animation, this DVD is probably not for you.  However, if you have an appreciation for animation, or if you are waiting for Neo or Morpheus to contact you through your computer, then get your geek on and get yourself a copy of the Animatrix.",1054857600,,1872,4.586826347305389

Each anime short is unique in its own way whether its the writing or animation style. The Anime shorts are:
  Final flight of the Osiris-A cool cg anime with a [bucket] load of action. The crew of the Osiris must warn Zion of the onslaught of advancing Sentinels before it's to late. This movie sets you up for the Matrix Reloaded.
  The second renaissance part 1-This anime has to do with the beginning of events that would later begin the war between the humans and the machines.
  The second renaissance part 2-This anime is about the war between the humans and machines and the creation of the matrix.
  Kid's story-Is the story about a teen hacker who by jumping off a building while escaping agents is able to wake him self up and unplug himself from the matrix. He does this because he does not believe what is happening to him is real.(this is about that annoying kid in the matrix reloaded who keeps bothering Neo).
  Program-Is about a a female practicing her fighting skills in a medieval Japan setting. When she encounters a fellow rebel something goes horrible wrong. This anime is great and has an even better ending.
  World Record-A runner with super fast speed is able to break the rules of the matrix and wake himself. Agents don't like this and silence him by putting him back to sleep rendering him comatosee. But the runner refuses to believe that he cant run and won't be stopped.
  Beyond-A women is invited to a haunted house by a group of kids who know its secret. The house is really a glitch in the matrix. There's a part of a highway street in the garden, rain in one part of the house and a hallway which becomes an alley. The women and kids are able to break the rules of the matrix. Agents find out and come to destroy the house and fix the problem.
  A Detective story-A detective is hired by the agents to track down trinity.
  Matriculated-A group of rebels kidnap a sentinel like robot and plug it into a simulation where it is given a choice to get help form a human to save it's life. The rebels are trying to give robots the ""choice"" to become good once more.(this one is very weird and out there I hate this one but at the same time like it).",1054771200,,2480,4.420704845814978
1850865,4,B00008LDPV,"""The Matrix Reloaded"" was a fantastic film-- after the first half hour or so, once the excruciatingly boring setup and that ludicrous Zion rave/sex scene were finished and the action kicked in. Similarly, ""The Animatrix"" is a phenomenal collection of anime interpretations of the Wachowski brothers' vision-- once you get past the first three segments (which add up to approximately half an hour... coincidence?)
Strangely, the weakest sections are the ones written by the brothers themselves. ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" is an absolutely gorgeous demonstration of the capabilities of CGI animation, but it's utterly empty plot-wise, and even the central action is fairly dull-- it's mostly a vehicle for Square to show off how they can create cool skin textures. The true abomination of this collection, though, comes with Mahiro Maeda's ""The Second Renaissance (Parts 1 and 2)"". It attempts to fill in the backstory of how the machines came to power and the Matrix was created, but it's so nihilistic, so repulsive in its violence, it leaves a bad aftertaste. Neither side, humans or robots, is the slightest bit sympathetic; Maeda pounds us relentlessly over the head with visions of brutality and cruelty, pretentiously evoking Vietnam and Tiennanmen Square, and the effect is overwrought and didactic. Rather than enlightening, it makes you feel that if humanity behaved this horribly, why should we care if Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus win the war?
Fortunately, it's all uphill from that point on. Shinichiro Watanabe's segments are especially effective; ""Kid's Story"" (the one successful Wachowski-written section) uses a pencil-sketch style that provides incredible fluidity of motion, and its minimalist story is well told; while ""Detective Story"" conjures the feel of classic black-and-white noir (love the computer with the old-fashioned typewriter keyboard!) The most traditionally ""anime"" of the films, Yoshiaki Kawajiri's ""Program"", is also one of the best, once again pivoting on a simple conundrum that proves more complex than it appears; the beautiful animation, evoking the look of medieval Japan, is far more compelling than Maeda's computer-enhanced effects in ""The Second Renaissance"".
I was also quite taken with Koji Morimoto's section, ""Beyond"", which expands on the idea that what we think of as supernatural phenomena are actually glitches in the Matrix. The character designs reminded me a bit of Gainax's ""FLCL"", while the detail in the backgrounds is on a par with Studio Ghibli's scrupulous work. And I enjoyed the two films that have received the harshest evalutations from others-- ""World Record"" (written by Kawajiri, directed by Takeshi Koike) uses a visual style drastically removed from traditional anime, but one well suited to the story it tells; and Peter Chung's ""Matriculated"", while suffering a little from its overly slick CGI surfaces, takes a fascinating approach-- what if a robot were plugged into a human-created Matrix? It's a little long, but still a solid mixture of philosophizing and action, in true ""Matrix"" tradition.
The extras are genuinely worthwile: making-of features on each film, a detailed history of anime drawing on interviews from genuine experts (though I do fault it for making no mention of Hayao Miyazaki), and directors' commentaries for four films. Sadly, two of those are the two parts of ""The Second Renaissance"", and they shed little light on why Maeda made his piece so unrelentingly vicious. I would rather have heard Watanabe discuss ""Kid's Story"" or ""Detective Story"" in greater detail.
So if you love ""The Matrix"", this collection is definitely worthwhile; just bear in mind you'll need to skip past the dismal segments to get to the real gems.",1054771200,21,3724,5.32427843803056
1850866,4,B00008LDPV,"I had no interest in getting this DVD until I saw a clip from it on a TV show last week.  For someone like me whose only real exposure to animation (other than Chuck Jones and Tex Avery cartoons) was the film ""Heavy Metal"" and the ""Battle of the Planets"" on television in the late 70's, this type of animation seemed, well, a bit nerdy.  BOY WAS I WRONG!!
This is stunning work!  Creative in its execution, brave in its storytelling, and mind-boggling in its visuals!
My favorite ones are the first three, but especially ""The Last Flight of the Orisis"" (did I misspell that?).  Animation sure has come a long way since the old days of painting on cels.  The computer-generated 3D-like visuals are so realistic that you almost forget you are watching animation. Think of the film ""Final Fantasy"" with the benefit of a few years' worth of technological improvements.
The second two short story animation pieces are as much commentary on the surety of modern civilization collapsing as they are simply backstory for the ""Matrix"" films.  They are morally thought-provoking and sociologically scary.
All in all, the 9 short films run the gamut over many different styles of animation, from the computer-generated to the more traditional.  The separate stories are bound by a common thread, but some of them diverge farther than others.  But the mixing of the numerous styles of animation keeps the whole affair from getting visually repetitive, and that is a definite plus, despite the fact that the animation is superb anyway.
The bonus features on the disc, including commentaries, b-t-s features, etc., are good for fleshing out what you get for your purchasing dollar, but I'd almost rather NOT know how they did some of this stuff.  It's really more fun just to watch it and stare in awe and wonder.  You animation junkies, however, will be more than pleased with the extras, I'd imagine.
Though each of these films are short (around 9 minutes each), none of them feel skimpy.  They were obviously crafted with as much meticulousness and caring and talent as the ""Matrix"" feature films were.
Bottom line, ""The Animatrix"" features some solid and compelling storytelling, and the fact that these are animated features hopefully will not scare away the more traditional film fans who have yet to discover how animation has jumped forward in leaps and bounds since many of us were kids.
Rent it if you want, but you'll probably end up buying it anyway.

First of all, the segment ""Beyond"" is, for me, worth the purchase price on its own.  I will be watching this one again and again, in both languages.  It is beautiful, poetic, mysterious and non-violent (not that I have a problem with violence).  Consequently, it (along with ""World Record"") is also probably the furthest removed from the ""Matrix"" motion pictures. I cannot praise this segment enough.
""Kid's Story"" and ""A Detective Story"" are also quite worthwhile.  Each exhibit unique artwork--from the hand-drawn, sketchy, explosive look of ""Kid's"" (a little reminiscent of Bill Plympton, though much less bizarre and cartoony) to the black & white, noir visuals of ""Detective.""  Both are fairly interesting stories with artwork appropriate to each.
Unlike many reviewers here, I enjoyed ""Program.""  While the story is not at all complex, I like the artwork quite a bit.
The rest:  ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" is technically impressive, but on the whole left me cold (much like ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" but that's a matter for another review).  ""The Second Renaissance"" two-parter is a retelling of the rise of the computers, and while I found the ""documentary"" approach (using ""news footage"" and visual cues from historical images of Vietnam and Tiananmen Square) interesting, I probably won't be revisiting this segment often.  I WANT to like ""World Record"" more; the art is very bold and unique, but I'm not really drawn into the story. Finally, concerning ""Matriculated,"" by ""Aeon Flux"" creator Peter Chung... didn't care much for ""Flux,"" and I can't say this did much for me either.
I feel I need to acknowledge the English language dubbing.  The voice talent is very good, with none of the goofy, distracting elements often associated with the genre.  (You know what I'm talking about--those weird ""HUH-H-H?"", ""WHA-A-A?"", ""AIEEE!"" type exclamations.)
RATINGS BREAKDOWN: ""Beyond"" -- 5/5. Obviously I really love this one.  ""Kid's"", ""Detective"" and ""Program"" -- 3.5/5.  The rest -- 2-3 stars or less.  Extra features -- 3-4/5. So overall, I've arbitrarily settled on 4/5.  ""Beyond"" makes me very satisfied with this purchase.",1054684800,,2321,5.215633423180593
1850868,5,B00008LDPV,"Though a few segments fell flat for me (""Matriculated"", ""World Record""), the others more than make up for it.  Combining anime creators with the Wachowski's post-apocalyptic vision was a stroke of pure genius.  ""Second Renaissance"" plays as a prequel to the first film, sort of a pre-history of The Matrix.  ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" and ""Kid's Story"" serve as a go-between, bridging the first and second films.  The others are kind of an anything goes approach, but attain a cohesiveness in style and theme. ""A Detective's Story"" has a downright tangible future noir feel that I can't recall seeing since Blade Runner.  The ghost story ""Beyond"" manages to be spooky, fun and beautiful all in the same frame.  The extras on the DVD are great fun as well, extremely informative, and packed with clips of the anime those interviewed are referencing.  The soundtrack CD -- available separately or in a two disc gift pack -- is the equal of the film, a great CD that'll likely stay in your stereo for some time.  Nicely done, and a must have for any Matrix or anime fan.",1054684800,,1069,4.709677419354839
1850869,4,B00008LDPV,"FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS
This computer generated prequel to the Matrix Reloaded, produced entirely in CGI, is the most technically advanced piece in this collection. There are moments when I forgot that I was watching virtual actors. The passion between the two main characters is intense, in a way that I thought computer images would never be able to imitate. An excellent short (not my favorite) but because of its intimate ties to the Matrix Reloaded, both in terms of story and style, seems out of place. It would have served better as the beginning of the second film.
THE SECOND RENAISSANCE PARTS I & II
Simply put, these pieces are the most powerful and provocative in the entire collection, filled with graphic and horrifying images. In a fascinating look at the prehistory of the Matrix films, humanity, not the machines, are the guilty party, enslaving an entire race of sentient life with no mercy. (As Gods, humans created machines in their image, so the slavers become the enslaved.) These shorts actually change the meaning of the overall film- very powerful.
KID'S STORY
A somewhat ho-hum story with some nice visuals and a cool ending that helps flesh out a small part of the second movie (don't want to give any spoilers) this segment is kind of pedestrian otherwise, with the skateboard tricks seeming to be the type of thing that would be cool in a 1980's comedy flick.
PROGRAM
Some interesting visuals help spice up a rather bland storyline in this short. Seems to be a remake of the fight seens between Morpheus and Neo in the first film. The story brings up the difficulty in accepting the bleak reality instead of the less bleak dreamworld, but never goes anywhere with the question.
WORLD RECORD
Perhaps the least visually appealing, with overly stylized runners going slo-mo for most of the short. If jiggly muscles are your thing, this is the short for you. No story substance in this one- very dull to watch. Also, whazzup with the agents?
BEYOND
A very beautiful piece, BEYOND is perhaps at heart the most simple story in the collection, with the focus on the perceptions of a young girl and some children in the face of mysteries they can never understand. Very engrossing.
A DETECTIVE STORY
A cool, stylish direction can not give this story the life it needed to fully flesh out. While it is the only one in the collection that focuses on the life of one of the major players in the film series (Trinity, with the voice done by the original actress, no less) the main character of the short is cardboard. Very disappointing.
MATRICULATED
The most bizarre and surreal of the bunch- this one took two viewings for me to understand its meaning, and still many of the images seem random, or bizarre for weirdness sake. The concept of pulling a machine into a human generated world and manipulating their perceptions is intriguing, but in the end we are left with many random but beautiful images that distract more than anything else.",1054684800,106,2963,4.755339805825242
1850870,3,B00008LDPV,"While the animation styles are varied and great if story drives your purchases I would wait until this is boxed with the Matrix set as I assume it will be.
It is a classic example of form over substance as the animation is varied and excellent but the stories are universally weak.
I was surprised in these shorts how many existing visual images were used. The dearth of original imagery is disturbing and makes me wonder and worry about what has been burned into our visual minds.
A definite rental but I wouldn't purchase it if you are not into animation. It really does not further the Matrix world at all.",1054684800,10,609,4.495495495495495
1850871,5,B00008LDPV,"Lots of good things to say about this DVD, but the main thing is that some of the segments are just... hauntingly beautiful.
This mainly goes for The Second Renaissance I and II. Which is sometimes extremely gruesome, but has an important story to tell. It also has some fantastic abract imagery that won't soon leave you.
The same can't be said for ""Beyond"", which has much less story, and no action, but which is even more beautiful in all its understatedness. If you like good drawings, I beg you to notice this masterpiece. It is probably the single most beautifully drawn piece of animation I have ever seen. Not the least the *composition* of the frames is amazing.
The concepts of the Matrix (what is reality? and are we prisoners?) are important to think about our situation in this world, and when they are represented as beautifully as here, they are a pleasure to consider also.",1054684800,4,889,4.6687898089171975
1850882,4,B00008LDPV,"It can be argued that this collection of 9 animated shorts based on the world of The Matrix was as anticipated as Reloaded.  I, for one, was incredibly intrigued just by the concept.  I asked myself ""could any movie actually pull this off?""  The Animatrix answers my question.  The world that The Wachowski Brothers have created truly is the Star Wars of this generation.  It is a cutural phenomena, and the quality of the 9 shorts that comprise The Animatrix show the impact of The Matrix.  Here's a review of each short:
1) Final Flight Of the Osiris-This is the only short film to be done in 3-D.  It was done, in fact, by the team behind the 3-D movie Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.  It looks great and incredibly realistic.  The story directly relates to the events in Reloaded.  A great way to kick off this collection because it is the most familiar in style and feel.
2 & 3) The Second Renaissance-This two-parter tells the story of how man and machine came to fight against each other.  Probably my favorite of all the shorts story-wise, because it gave me chills and also made me think way too much about the possibilities it presents.  Be warned, this is probably the most violent of all the short films here.
4) Kid's Story-Another story that directly relates to something alluded to in Reloaded.  Remember the annoying kid Neo encountered in Zion who always followed him everywhere?  This is your chance to see what that was really about.
5) Program-This short deals with the training process people who have been freed must go through.  It has absoutely breathtaking animation, and is the most ""anime"" of the 9.
6) World Record-This story shows the possibilities of being ""plugged-in.""  Think that the only way someone can be freed is by taking the red pill?  Watch this.  The most interesting and inventive story as far as I'm concerned, coupled with a unique style of animation.
7) Beyond-This short deals with how the machines handled glitches in the system.  It has gorgeous animation, with bright colors and a thoroughly Japanese look.
8) A Detective Story-Remember Trinity's legendary hacker status, alluded to in the first movie?  This is the whole story.  This one has a very unique style that I think fit the feel of the story well, and it's nice to see Trinity when she was still the baddest hacker on the block.
9) Matriculated-Can the machines be convinced to join the human side?  After all, if humans were batteries and if machines have A.I., doesn't that make both man and machine connected in some way?  This last short, with the best-looking animation out of the 9, answers those questions.  Just as The Second Renaissance will make you feel for man, this one will make you feel for the other side.
Overall, I'd say The Animatrix succeeded what it set out to do.  This was never meant to be enjoyed on the same level as the movies, it was meant to give everyone a further understanding of what The Matrix is and provide a more detailed backstory to complement the movies.  It is great to see how the animators do sometimes recreate such effects as bullet-time.  It comes very very close to being as dazzling and visually stunning as the movies themselves.  The stories are a little sad, but they also kind of have to be.  The root of why The Matrix is so popular is because there is nothing as painful for humans to watch than well, ourselves.  The Matrix is spectacular and impossible, and at the same time the emotional impact of these 9 shorts, as well as the movies, is what really keeps the audience watching.
As for the DVD itself, the menus are at once cool and a little bit overdone (navigating them can be a little weird the first time you pop it into your DVD player).  There are few extras but nothing fancy, although the commentaries included on The Second Renaissance 1 and 2, Program, Beyond from the creators offer insight into the stories as well as the conceptual process (don't worry they are subtitled in English).
Overall, if you are a fan of the movie, or of animation, you owe it to yourself to check The Animatrix out.  The stories are great, the animation is both varied and beautiful, and the whole thing is, quite simply, cool.  In a word: whoa.",1054598400,73,4206,4.62533692722372
1850883,4,B00008LDPV,"the animatrix is a collection of 9 short storys made by japans most talented artists and directors personally i do not like cartoons or any show figureing colorful characters but since its the matrix that was an acception when it came out on dvd which was today i went and purchased it and watched the entire dvd now here my striahgt forward review on all of the short storys based on the matrix
1. Final Flight of The Osiris- this was an amazing piece of art it had really great visual effects and a good story one of the best action storys on the DvD
2. The Second Renaissance Parts 1-2 this piece probually had the best story of all the 9 storys it tells the backstory of the downfall of the humans and the rise of the machines i find this piece quite disturbing brutal, yet i also find it simply the best
3. Kids Story- this was good quite good its about a kid that recieves a message from Neo telling him that agents are after him when recieving this message the kid quickly moves about running from the agents until his death and his departure from the matrix
4. Program- about 2 samurai warriors facing off at each other in a duel i thought this one was great because the fighting was so impressive this one is a thumbs up
5. World Record- this one was a so-so it was enjoyable and bland it isn't the best but it did keep me intrested mainly about a runner that is so fast that he could run into and out the matrix anytime he wants
6. Beyond- this one was werid yet confusing at the same time its about a girl who is looking for her cat and runs into a group of kids that can float and do tricks in the air then she discovers that she can do those tricks also it appears to me that the story Beyond is about a glitch in the matrix
7. A Dectective Story- animated in black and white this story tells about a dectective that is hard up for cash he gets a phone call by agents saying that he he can catch a computer hacker by the name of trinity that he will be payed he sets out for trinity later learning that the reason the agents wanted to have him find her was because the agents placed a bug into him and are tracking his every move
8. Matricculated- where can i begin this one was a downfall or at least to me this was quite confusing no actually really confusing and very bland bummer since it was the last one but it did have some good points but those were spent quickly
over all - if you like the matrix then this is a must buy it is very good it deserves 4 stars only because of matricculated and world record and beyond but i would rather watch world record and beyond over matricculated any day overall not a bad dvd buy if you like the matrix----Ben N.",1054598400,,2671,4.128598848368522
1850884,4,B00008LDPV,"My video store put this out this weekend and I rented it to see if I would buy it. In the end Ive decided to pass but my wife and I did watch the whole thing including the bonuses.  To begin, although the content here does help give some of the backdrop for reloaded, only 2 of the 9 short episodes really directly pertain to the action
Final Flight Of The Osiris: Tells the story of how the humans discovered the machines were drilling down.  It is fully Computer Generated, and quite realistic... much like Final Fantasy.
Kids Story: Tells the story of how a boy liberates himself from the Matrix.  This is the same kid from Reloaded who keeps thanking Neo.  It is hand drawn and has one of the coolest animation techniques you will ever see. It is one of two contributions from the director of Cowboy Bebop.
2 other shorts will be quite interesting for Matrix the movie fans, these are The Second Rennaisance 1 and 2: This is a sort of history lesson on how the machines came to power. The second renaissance refers to how machines found a way to harnass the power of humans (in the first one humans learned how to use machines).  It also shows how the world was destroyed by the war between the 2 groups, and from a story stand point this is really neat stuff.
The rest of the shorts take place in the matrix world but don't add a lot to your understanding, they just sort of flesh things out.
Program: Its a old fashion samurai duel in a virtual training mode.  By the director of Wicked City, and Ninja Scroll.
World Record: A runner who will let nothing stop him to break the world speed record, he somehow manages to break out of the matrix temporarily.
Detective Story: Also directed by the Cowboy bebop creator is the second most interesting animation wise.  It does have Trinity in it, but it really adds nothing to your understanding of either the matrix or her.  Still its an interesting stand alone, and the animation is very memorable.
Matriculated: Is about a small group of humans that are reprograming machines in the ""real world"" to help the humans.  Its really hard to understand the story here and is probably the most high reaching, but least interesting of the bunch. Its by the creator of Aeon Flux, so that should give you some idea if youll like it.
Beyond: takes place as a girl searches for her lost cat. Her and a group of children find an area that may be a ""rip"" in the matrix where wierd stuff happens - bottles crashing then being rejoined, levitation, etc.  Natives say the place is haunted - A neat twist, along the lines of the wearwolves and ghosts from reloaded.
More importantly, and perhaps as enjoyable as the shorts themselves, the disc features a short documentary on the convergence between anime and Hollywood action movies.  Perhaps the best line is when a bemused Todd McFarlane wonders aloud, ""Its strange how the same people who laugh about comics, Love action blockbusters.""
In addition there are individual documentaries for each of the shorts. Hearing (or reading as the case may be) these Japanese masters talk about their craft is really inspirational and interesting.
That is why, the disc is more for Anime lovers than Matrix fans.  Of course there is no doubt there is a large overlap.  Still, the disc is probably not worth owning if the documentary features don't interest you a lot.  Id recommend a rent first.  For lovers of evangelon, bebop, akira and ninja scroll... This will be an excellent addition to your collection.
In fact if you have an anime ""collection"" to begin with (or know someone who does), this will almost certainly be a very appreciated item.",1054425600,,3623,4.586687306501548
1850885,5,B00008LDPV,"All 9 episodes are of the highest quality - the animation is simply stunning and while the pace of the stories may seem a bit sluggish they are all atmospheric and totally fit in with the whole Matrix trilogy.
The background to the Matrix world and the whole insight into other areas or details that links the films (Final Flight of the Osiris) is amazing and helps to give a much fuller, richer environment to enjoy the whole Matrix phenomenon.",1054425600,,445,4.575
1850886,3,B00008LDPV,"Admittedly I waited with a lot of anticipation for this project; an anime-influenced lesson in story-telling from a series of Japanese masters about issues and things that they are well known for ' it seemed so much like a perfect match of Japanese current cultural thinking and awareness and American movie-making and marketing tie-ins. On DVD only. How cool is that?
For much of The Animatrix however it all seems to go horribly wrong. What appears instead is a sometimes cool, sometimes haphazard pitter-patter of stories and varying animation techniques that only really touch the surface of The Matrix and provide scattershot storytelling. Here are some examples:
Two of the DVD's nine segments, The Second Renaissance parts one and two, deal with an interesting overview of the fall of corrupt man and the rise of the machines. While it's nice to have a backdrop of the movies, The Second Renaissance makes you wonder why the characters should even bother or why you should care. Witness the imagery of the pyramid building and you'll get the picture.
The masterpiece of the Animatrix is of course the Final Flight of the Osiris, a total CGI love-fest created by Square Pictures (the Final Fantasy movie being their only other project of note). The plot involves the discovery of the machines boring tunnels leading straight to Zion, the resistance movement in the 'real world' and the attempt by the ship Osiris to deliver a warning to the Resistance via a drop box in The Matrix. Half of this segment however is geared towards a program-style training fight scene between Thadeus and Jue, two of the crew (and lovers apparently). In the context of everything that will take place, what the hell is the purpose of this scene, other than to show a perfectly rendered rear-end of Jue? Whole parts of this segment scream out to show you how cool it all is, but really are quite pointless.
In Kid's Story there's another unique animation style that is rather hard to describe - remember the a-ha music video 'Take on me' from the 80's, it's like that - which at times works really well and other times looks like it was scrawled by a toddler. This is another segment that ties into the movies (though is less apparent and doesn't involve the overall plot quite like Final Flight of the Osiris). So it wasn't half bad.
World Record is plum awful, and features an annoying exaggerated drawing style, especially the depiction of the agents. In the end, uh, what happened? The idea is interesting but how the story gets to the end, and the resolution, is just bad.
Program utilized another fighting program plot, though it turns out to be a rehash of a Matrix plot and is ultimately, again, disappointing.
Another segment was a black and white film noir-style piece called Detective Story, but felt out of place and in the end went nowhere. A Raymond Chandler-esque detective is hired by, well, a Program (basically) to find Trinity since the programs can't do it themselves. Using a computer interface and screen that looks like it came screaming from a set of the movie Brazil, the detective goes on his ultimate quest. The voice-over is terrible and again parts pay homage to The Matrix for no good reason.
Like Detective Story, the Animatrix fell way short of being a decent method of getting some good stories across. Maybe I was expecting way too much of this, but it sure seems like everything produced after The Matrix (the Matrix Reloaded, Enter the Matrix, and the Animatrix) have been below par. Instead of inspiring to produce better and more interesting stories, instead the Wachowski brothers, who oversaw all of the projects and are ultimately responsible, really lowered the bar a bit much.
That being said, the Animatrix still has some redeeming qualities and I'm glad the Wachowski brothers used a new method to expand on the universe of The Matrix. The problem is that with some superior writing and better coordination with the Japanese directing talents, it could have been so much better.
For parents: there is a bit of bloody violence and a wee bit of nudity here so being animated doesn't mean that the Animatrix is for kids. It's not.",1054339200,44,4158,4.816783216783217
1850887,4,B00008LDPV,"This was a bold and daring project that acts as a companion piece to The Matrix Trilogy. Since the movies have no time to explore all the many little questions we have about the matrix this was an ingenious way to explore many interesting and thought provoking elements of a world where man is a mind slave to machines. Each episode tackles an issue that you may or may not have thought about when watching the first (or second) film. While most of them are top-notch in the art direction department they do lack a little more depth in terms of telling a complete story. For example in Kid's Story we get a kid who (like Neo) is curious of what the matrix is and has heard of the legendary Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus. But how did he learn this? We get no back story to his inquiry or curiosity, just the up to the moment decision of him breaking free just like Neo did, while it was great, it didn't explore anything different than the first movie. The most baffling and dazzling of all of these short films is Matriculated, which like in AEON FLUX style shows alot and explains very little. It tackles some really great ideas on slavery, conversion, and doing to the machines what they have done to the humans. It's definetly one of the more open ended shorts and is great to discuss with friends. Flight of the Osiris may appear dazzling but too much time I fear is wasted on a fight/strip tease that has little or nothing to do with the plot. Time is wasted on this when we could have learned a little more about the crew/ and the events leading up to the machines discovering zions location.
The second renaissance I and II are the most straight forward and revealing of all the shorts. Giving an excellent play by play of what lead up to the machine rebellion and eventual creation of The Matrix. It is graphic and extremely real, it disturbingly shows us what hatred and segregation can lead too if we do not, as a people, learn to except all forms of life and live with them peacefully and cooperatively. A strong message told through science fiction.
This is an amazing effort that includes some of the top-names in Anime today. It is fresh and daring in todays world of spoon-feeding plot lines and two dimensional characters. It brings to life the matrix like never before. Watching this along with playing the game gives a very complete history of the Matrix and the events leading to and discussed in the second film. This is for fans only. Enjoy the Ride, its a good one.",1054339200,,2484,4.461538461538462

1850889,4,B00008LDPV,"Okay, so this is a nice addition to the Matrix canon, and does give us a lot of back story to the events that happen in the live action films.
The stories are mostly entertaining, though a couple are as gruesome and troubling as possible. If you are not the kind of person that enjoys bodies being mutilated and people being killed cruelly by robots, this might not be for you. Also, if you don't like the Matrix films, this is not for you. In fact, why are you even reading this?
The animation is great, the sound is excellent, and overall the dvd is worthwhile. If you enjoy really wild animation and special effects, you will certainly like this.
HOWEVER - just because this is animated does NOT mean that this is child appropriate. It is not. It is completely inappropriate (IMO) for children under the age of 12. It is very violent and contains images that are FAR too incomprehensible for young children, not to mention R rated language.

In ""Program"" , it is the most apparent. Some of the most beautifully drawn animation I've ever seen with flat uninteresting dialog in the writing and delivery.
This reminds me a bit of Final Fantasy. Again, a piece of excellent ly done ground breaking animation, but the voice direction was weak and writing terrible.
I hope this opens the doors for most animation and maybe, someday, we'll get our cake and get to eat it too.",1053907200,33,625,4.6909090909090905

There's no need to say the first animation, called The Final Flight Of The Osiris, is one of the best animations ever made.  For the fans of the Matrix, The 2 episodes of The Second Renaissance reveals in depth plots and background about this visionary trilogy.  And also the last episode A Kid's Story, reveals the history behind a character which appears in the second movie The Matrix Reloaded.  It is obvious who it is when you watch it.

Also, agents are tracking the leaked area, and on the way to fix it and make the people forget what they saw. This girl also goes to save her cat.

Kid's Story is about a kid who cannot sleep, like Neo, and Neo sends him a message, in which causes a pursuit through his school to where he falls to his death-- in the matrix-- and is free'd into the real world through self-substantation(sp) he is also the Kid who wishes to carry neo's bags in Reloaded.
I was quite glad to see the Animatrix, Enter the Matrix and Reloaded work with eachother to un cover the story of the 2nd movie.
Also, this is definately worth the buy, i couldn't pull myself away when I saw them personally.  Ended up going to bed 2 hours after I really needed to.
Also, World Record is an incredably good story of this man who is aware of the matrix through his extreme abilties in his muscles, and lack of the Matrix to define his strength and speed without making him free.
THe 2nd Renassiance (1 and 2) tell an amazing history story of everything behind the matrix (in their world) and keeps you glued to what goes on.  They describe how they ""scortch the sky"" too.",1053648000,8,1293,4.282786885245901

In some ways, I even believe that this is better than the Matrix Reloaded, because each individual peice (especially ""The Second Reniassance I & II"" - they are incredible) is so well done and so enthralling.

The CG animation, with diverse style, is excellent. However, if you are not one of those true matrix or sci fi fans, you may not be able to appreciate the whole DVD in 100%. My wife kept on asking me why this why that and I could not satisfy her in her understandable language, though she likes the movie still (even without Keanu). The stories, which distinguished this DVD from tons of other CG OVA in rental shops, are short but great. It should be viewed as a supplement to the Matrix trilogy, I believe, though I don't know what Reloaded and Revolution are all about yet.",1053216000,11,612,4.424778761061947
1850907,4,B00008LDPV,"After seeing the animatrix at the cinema I was impressed by the overall visual quality and integration of CG. WHy are the other reviews in here filled with innacurate descriptions of what it some of them are about or who the directors are?
They were very good overall with standouts for me being those directed by SHinichiro Watanabe- Beyond and detective story.
I found the 2 parts of renaissance to be weak and didn't like having the borrowed imagery from WWII and ideas from Asimov all congealed in an un-appealing mess and shoved down my throat. I expected better considering it was written by the wachowskis. It really but me in mind of metropolis but done in a half arse kind of way. WHile visually to metropolis it is still very pretty",1052611200,3,742,4.628787878787879
1850908,5,B00008LDPV,"Having been lucky enough to have seen the 9 episodes, I can say that the Wachowskys are the best thing to happen to movies in a long time, and this generation's creativity icons in Hollywood.  That they could take The Matrix's success and share the wealth with this incredible project, giving so many people a chance to showcase their talent while giving the world of The Matrix an exciting new medium in which to express itself, shows their brilliance, and that they are no one-trick ponies.
I'll start by commenting on the overwhelming rave reviews for ""Final Flight of the Osiris"".  In truth, with all the hype, when I finally did see it, I was sorely disappointed.  Technically, yes, it is brilliant, as I feel is the usual with Square's work (definitely including the Final Fantasy film).  But the execution is way too juvenile.  The initial fight scene and the pipe acrobatics (while the fate of humanity is ticking) scene are so ridiculous and juvenile that they are almost embarrassing to watch.  You'll know when you see them.  Suffice it to say that everyone will be awed by the CGI quality, but its overall appeal will only lie with the pre-teen crowd.  Good action, fabulous animation, but disappointing plot execution.
The best of the 9 are, in my opinion, the two Second Renaissance parts and Kid's Story.  They are the most entertaining, bold, intelligent, and artistically brilliant of the bunch.  The dark Second Renaissance will bring chills down your spine, and the touching Kid's Story takes a basically action-oriented short and enhances it with brilliant artistic shifts and terrific music.
The worst of the bunch is, without hesitation, Program.  It is the one regrettable mar on an otherwise brilliant DVD.  Very derivative and juvenile, both artistically and plot-wise, it's the only one that wasn't brave enough to examine The Matrix's world in any real way...it is just a very weak, over-the-top Samurai fight scene that just happens to take place in a Construct program.  It's nothing that isn't dime-a-dozen with TV-cartoon-quality anime, and the fact that the Program team wasted the incredible opportunity to push the envelope (that the other shorts took advantage of), is a real shame.  Program does not belong on this DVD.
That aside, however, The Animatrix is one of the most exciting and different projects to come out of the Hollywood machine in a long time.  It is incredibly entertaining, often brilliant, and vrey reasonably priced.  And as an aside, the Wachowskys and the incredible anime talent they shared their good fortune with, all deserve your support.  This is the no-brainer purchase of the year, especially (though not only) for anime and Matrix fans.",1052524800,14,2701,4.993303571428571

1850910,4,B00008LDPV,"from an anime fan, overall a solid 4 stars out of 5. loved the animation.  my real only complaint is that they're short stories and not full features. for some of the better ones, i would have liked them to be longer.  here's my review of each part:
1. last flight of the osiris - this is from the makers of the final fantasy.  i didn't like FF but this had a really good story start to finish. also the animation is even more realistic than FF down to the pore.  not really pure anime but does have show its influence.
2. the second renaissance - i loved this animation. the story was very compelling. first part was great, second part seemed more like a documentary.
3. program - from the acclaimed artist of ninja scroll, i found the story interesting but the art seemed like a rush job. somewhat of a sour spot in ths set.
4. world record - i found this one kinda boring.  didn't find anything compelling about the character or story.  the art was nice tho'.
5. kids story - this was my favorite of the bunch in terms of story. the art direction was really good and a very riveting story.
6. Detective Story - the pace and dialog seemed kinda off. nice mood and i like how trinity plays a role but an overall letdown.
7. Beyond - this is 21st century anime art direction at its best and also one of my favorites. a nice cute little ghost story.
8. Matriculate - by peter cheung of aeon flux, the art is eye candy. peter has come a long way. i really like the concept of this piece where humans try to manipulate the thoughts of robots and question the ethics of slavery.",1052265600,78,1574,4.23
1850921,5,B00008LDPV,"I've seen a good chunk of this on the web and other places, and all I can say is WOW.
What is the Animatrix? In a nutshell, it is a collection of short Matrix stories that are animated. And the cool thing about it is that they're all mostly animated in different ways. (A few are done in anime, another in full CG, some just plain old animation, and others a mix of 2 or a mix of three of the above.)
The DVD will have nine (9) episodes to watch. Here's a quick overview of the ones I know a lot about and/or have seen:
1) THE SECOND RENNAISANCE, PARTS 1 and 2: This is a 2-parter that fills is all of the backstory that happened before the first Matrix film. It chronciles how the machines were made, how they took control, the war between the humans and the machines, and the creation of the Matrix. (Made in plain animation)
2) PROGRAM: Most of this one is fashioned and made like an Akira Kurosawa film. It's basically a duel between two samuari-like warriors in a matrix program where the setting is ancient Japan. (Made in anime)
3) WORLD RECORD: This one is basically about an extremely fast runner that can ""run out of the Matrix and in to the real world"" just because of pure strength/speed.
4) DETECTIVE STORY: This story, animated in black and white, fills in the critical backstory of the Trinity character from the movies. Includes voice acting by actress Carrie-Anne Moss.
5) FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS: Basically, this is a 9-minute completely CG animated story that serves as a prequel to ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Enter the Matrix (GAME)."" It begins as a blindfold sword duel and then escalates in to a ship chase with sentinels. This one has great action and great plotting, as well as convincing animation (Think ""Final Fantasy,"" except 10 times more realistic.) I saw this one in the theatre. WOW!!!
There are a few more, entitled KID'S STORY, MATRICULATED, and BEYOND.
JUDGING FROM THE TRAILER, MATRICULATED is an extremely wierd episode with a mix of CG animation and regular animation.
BEYOND follows a group of kids in to a ""haunted"" house. Agents find them and capture them because of they're too close to finding out something secret.
KID'S STORY is about a boy running from agents. (That's all I could gather from the trailer.)
For more information, watch the trailer on the web. Thanks for reading!",1052265600,214,2327,4.58273381294964
1850922,5,B00008LDPV,"Well now... you have the directors of Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Akira, Ninja Scroll, the Final Fantasy Movie, and Aeon Flux all popped into one nice DVD. Out of the episodes I've seen, which are the 4 episodes on the official website and the Osiris short shown with Dreamcatcher, the Animatrix DVD is gonna be one of my ""must buys"" for June.
Each episode is not to go unnoticed each showing a particular side of the Matrix universe (including how it was created) making it an essential for any Matrix fan. Also one has to respect the amount of quality in detail and animation put into each short episode.
If you're not an Anime fan.. these episodes should show you why you should be :-b. If you are, you should know what to expect from these directors and in my opinion, i think you won't be disappointed.",1052265600,,805,4.52054794520548
1850923,4,B00008LDPV,"Normally not one to review an item that isn't out yet, I've seen half the shorts on here so my opinion is at least somewhat educated. You too can see four of the shorts by visiting the Animatrix website. Amazon doesn't usually allow URLs in their reviews but I'll give you one guess as to what it is.
The Animatrix was conceived by the brothers Wachoski (the guys who made the original films). Four of the nine shorts were also written by them. One unfluential medium for the movie The Matrix was comic books, and the brothers successfully used this medium to not only tell parts of the story but introduce the world of the Matrix to the world (you can find the free online-comics on the Matrix website). Now, another highly influential medium to the brothers, anime (or Japanese animation) is being used to tell other parts of the grand story (and introduce the second film).
For casual fans of the movies, it is not necessary to buy this DVD. It has extra, but not intregal, story material. It's more of a bonus for people who want more (three films isn't nearly enough for many fans). What you get in this are nine anime short films directed by top names in their field. For anime fans this alone makes it worth buying. For Matrix fans it means you're getting quality. All the films are supervised by the brothers and four were written by them to ensure their proper place in the Matrix continuity.
Since this review is for American audiences, it's important to note something. This is NOT for young children! The reason this is important to note is because Americans seem trained to associate animation equals kids. Some of the shorts portay gruesome violence (even more so than the films thus far). Indeed, much like the film, the stories are very intellectual and not written for a child's mindset anyway.
In all, if you are a fan of the films, you need to check this out. It's really well done, and gives a lot of insight into how the world as we know it developed into the future world that Morpheus describes. Don't expect it to be better than the films, but it is a worthy addition.",1052265600,,2092,4.522427440633245
1850924,5,B00008LDPV,"I have gotten a sneak peak at ALL of the Animatrix episodes and each one of them is AMAZING. They are really a work of art and you finally see that things are not as black and white as they may seem. And you ask yourself who the real bad guys are, humans or the machines. This is really a must own for all anime lovers and all those that have seen the matrix. And just for the record this is my first anime I have seen, since I don't ever watch them or like them, but this truly is a great movie.
Picture: It's great, you can't expect too much. It's perfect DVD quality, doesn't get better than that.
Sound: Very good. You're not getting 5.1 but it's still very good.
Features: None that I have seen, so I can't rate it at the moment.",1052092800,,734,4.034246575342466

Unlike the Matrix, the Animatrix is collection of short anime's (to short to hold your your attention, let alone remember them to recamend to a friend).  The animation itself isn't bad,  infact it's pretty good,  the problem is, that the only thing they are showing is naked chicks and these fake looking robots that could come straight from an H.

1850929,3,B00008LDPV,"I must say that The Flight of Osiris has some of the most realistic animation I have ever seen. You could almost pass it by as a live action short. It seemed to be too short though. I have also seen three other shorts on the internet. The animation of The Second Renaissance isn't up to par in its style of animation as compared to Osiris' in computer animation. The story though is very interesting because it begins to outline the war between humans and machines. If you are more of a fan of anime you will be pleased with Program. I am not a big fan of Japanese anime but felt that it was well animated and had a somewhat interesting storyline. The last short available for viewing right now is A Detective Story. The animation for this just so so, but some of the visuals are interesting. The story though seemed to be very weak and poorly scripted. I would highly suggest this DVD to those who are big fans of The Matrix. Even if you aren't a fan of The Matrix and just a fan of animation, you should really check out The Flight of Osiris.",1050278400,7,1044,4.251256281407035

I could not believe how realistic the characters were and the story line was terrific.  After first seeing it I did not really like the story, but that was before I knew that it was only part of a greater picture.  Now knowing this vital bit of information I realize that for nine minutes of film there is a lot of action going on. The movements of the individual characters is fluid and graceful with little or no evidence of the process in the final product.  The skin along the joints stretches and retracts as they move.  I could not believe how real they appear in the opening scene, the only thing unreal about it was how high they could jump.  Flying in slow motion gives the viewer the ability to see the near individual strands of hair move as if blown by the wind.

The animation and narrative is in a setting the provokes lots of thinking and in a way reflects the inefficiency and chaos of human society in its current state.
