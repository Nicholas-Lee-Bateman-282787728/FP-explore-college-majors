3919430,4,B002ERQWW2,"This is a very cute and fun way to learn.  WordWorld has done it again with fun stories about Valentine's Day.  My sons liked the two stories and it is always good to learn in a fun way.  My biggest complaint with this DVD is that there are only two stories on this DVD.  The DVD shows a running time of an hour but these two episodes didn't even come close to that.  My kids were disappointed because our other WordWorld DVDs have more stories on them.  I guess I need to pay better attention to the descriptions.  Anyway, the stories on the DVD are titled, My Fuzzy Valentine and The Love Bug.

The first story revolves around sheep trying to figure out a rhyme for her song for her best friend, bear - what word rhymes with ART.  She finally realizes after talking to her friends about different words that rhyme with ART (we - as in four year olds - laughed a lot for some reason over the monkey and the banana cart rhyme) that it is the word HEART she is looking for and just in time for the party!  The second story involves bug and his friend frog.  Bug has never spelled his own name.  He wants to sign a Valentine for his best friend but he needs to learn how to do so.  His friend, frog, helps him learn how to spell his name and lo and behold, the Valentine is for Frog - his best friend.",1326931200,,1299,4.107142857142857

3919432,2,B002ERQWW2,"I bought this DVD along with the Christmas DVD episode of Word World, because my son loves the series and i liked the idea of buying the holiday-oriented ones. But there is only 30 min of actual episode playing time on this - it is not 60 min. The other 30 min are commercials. In my opinion, 30 min of commercials, along with 2 15 min episodes, does not add up to '60 min playing time' and therefore this DVD is not worth the money i paid for it. I won't be purchasing any more of these 2-episode sets.",1289865600,17,503,4.090909090909091

3919438,5,B002ERQWW2,"Word World is one of my son's favorite shows and he just can't get enough of it.  Not only is Word World on everyday but they also come out with great holiday specials.  Well they have done it again and come out with Word World My Fuzzy Valentine.

If you have never watched Word World before, it is an adorable show for kids any ages.  All the animals are comprised of the letters that spell them.  For example, the ant is made of the letters A-N-T and the same for sheep, frog, duck, pig, and the rest of the gang.  Even items in the show like a car, cloud, and more are also spelled out.

In My Fuzzy Valentine there are two episodes with a total running time of 60 minutes.  There is even a bonus music video, ""It's Time to Rhyme.""  The episodes focus on helping others out, learning to rhyme, working together, and other good values that PBS shows usually are built on.  I admit I like the show too and the songs they sing usually stick in my head!  I love though how the show makes learning fun and I really think it is helping Aidan out with his letters.  He recognizes the letters and animals and so at least he is getting some educational value from his cartoon time.",1264291200,4,1176,4.2242152466367715
