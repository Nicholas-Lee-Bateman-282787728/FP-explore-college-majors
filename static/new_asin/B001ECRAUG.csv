8297735,4,B001ECRAUG,"I've tried each DVD from this bundle. I prefer the 10 Minute Solution because it provides so many options for creating your own workout based on a time limit. The moves are clearly explained as they're demonstrated by the instructor. Apparently, I have muscles I was not entirely aware of beforehand, because I can feel them burning as I move through these workouts... but it's a good burn. In fact, it feels great! I bought this bundle the same day I bought the dance workout bundle, and I definitely prefer this one.",1264723200,2,518,4.641304347826087
8297736,5,B001ECRAUG,"This is a wonderful combination of DVDs if you want to learn yoga and/or just improve your positions. I'm so glad I got it, it's the cost of about 2 classes but gives you 4 DVDs to practice with.

The 10-minute yoga has 5 separate 10-minute segments, so you can do one a day or all 5 at once if you've got the time. The DVD has Yoga Basics, Yoga for Buns & Thighs, Yoga for Abs, and Yoga for Flexibility & Relaxation. I love when I don't have much time and can do 10 minutes. Seriously, 10-minutes is better than nothing.

There are two 'Crunch' DVDs, one is candlelight yoga and the other is a Pilates/Yoga mix, both are good. If you have time at the end of your day, the candlelight DVD is a good way to work out the days' stress. It's nice if you light some safe candles too.

The Yoga for Dummies is a solid intro into yoga. Despite the title, it's geared towards thinking people. It's a good DVD, and is paced well.

I really like this set. It's given me a boost to keeping up my yoga regimen at home.",1262822400,3,1006,4.091370558375634
