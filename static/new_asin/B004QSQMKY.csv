PINK SNAPPER,No guessing just rent it for the surprise and there are lots to behold...Very clever ending and these all seem to have a moral to them,Huh..Try to get one out of SAW 13.
Wrapping all this up is SKETCHER,Kind of has a EVIL DEAD tome look.
Please Anthony G. Sumner and Eric Richter take a bow,Job well done ...Good movie = Worth the rental fees.",1305158400,,723,4.934426229508197

""Slices of Life is a gutsy, gruesome, and complex film with compelling themes of both the light and darkness of human nature and the questioning of which will prevail in the end."" - Horror Yearbook

""A blood soaked horror anthology that easily stands with the best of its kind!""- Killingboxx

""SLICES OF LIFE far exceeded my expectations and is a hugely entertaining flick with great writing, overall strong performances, and tons of well-done gore. Tons!"""" - Anything Horror",1303344000,,1017,6.9140625
4455609,5,B004QSQMKY,"I agree with reviewer J!  This movie is very fun but at the same time it's also PEE-IN-YOUR PANTS SCARY!

I love horror movies that don't take themselves too seriously-- you know, the ones that provide a nice balance of laugh and scare so that you have some time to catch your breath before jumping out of your seat with horror...  and that's exactly what Slices of Life gives the audience.  Personally, I saw the movie at the Dark Carnival in Bloomington and was joined by my fellow viewers with chuckles and gasps throughout the course of the film.

I loved that each of the stories had a balance too- the first was zombie, the second was ghost and the third was GORE!  Horror movie fans of each type can enjoy.

Thought the acting was right on and the little old lady in the frame story was awesome!",1303344000,3,802,4.378378378378378
4455610,5,B004QSQMKY,"Wow, what a movie! Mr. Anthony G. Sumner really hit this one out of the park. I saw this at the premier in Chicago about six months and ordered it about 5 times on demand. This dvd will be saving me some money! It's totally worth it, I won't ruin it for anyone but this is a MUST SEE MOVIE. I guarantee you'll want more, much more!",1303344000,2,331,3.955223880597015
4455611,5,B004QSQMKY,"I saw this film at its premiere at the Chicago Horror Society Festival and found it to be a lot of of fun and pretty creepy. Slices of Life is an anthology of three short horror films with a wraparound story to tie the films together. The great thing about this film is that there is something for everyone in it - zombies, sex, ghosts, murderers, incestuous overtones, man-eating lady parts, and a LOT of blood...it's nearly impossible to be bored by this film! The stories themselves are a lot of fun - very reminiscent of Tales from the Crypt, Creep Show, and other 80's horror. Also, there are some standout stars such as Toya Turner and Deneen Melody. These are definitely actresses to keep your eye on!

Check out Slices of Life - it's a great low-budget indie horror movie that feels like a 80's film. You won't be disappointed!",1303344000,4,835,4.529801324503311
4455612,2,B004QSQMKY,"I originally saw this over 6 months ago in Chicago while I was at one of Horror Society's film festivals. While I saw a bunch of great indie flicks (Slime City Massacre, A Serbian Film, and Popatopolis were the three best feature length ones), I also saw some I didn't like. This was the worst of all the feature films I saw during the 2 day party.

Here's what I liked about it:

1. It was a horror anthology and I am a huge sucker for them.
2. I actually liked the idea of the first 2 stories.
3. The third story has a decent amount of gore.

Here's what I hated about it:

1. First story seems to go nowhere after dragging on for a long time.
2. Very predictable ending to the second story.
3. Third story is incredibly unoriginal. Ever see Teeth or Alien? Imagine a combination of the two along with a story of rape/revenge.
4. The special effects look as though they were added by the most basic software. If you hate that ""SCARY FACE"" effect that everybody and their mother who has a youtube love to try and show off, then you will want to kill yourself before the second story is over. The effect might have been cool in the 80s, but it is not scary and looks like crap.
5. The tie-in story is horrible. It's not well explained and the end ""pay-off"" is foreseeable and lame. Reminds me of the tie-in story to Late Fee (Ugh. Better not remind myself of that).

Now I'm giving it a 2/5 because I may give this a second chance. From what I remember it was a 1 but that could be for a few reasons :

1. The event was public admission - Being an established reviewer in the horror community, it get's bothersome to try and critique films while a large family with a ratio of 4 kids under the age of 10 to 1 mom are screaming at everything that happens around them. This doesn't just pertain to this film but it ties into my next two points.

2. It was the ""WORLD PREMIERE""!!!!!! - This normally isn't a bad thing but it seems like 400 more people entered the Portage theater right as this was about to start. This includes but is not limited to some no-name reporter (No offense to him. I myself fall under this category occasionally) and his camera guy, the possibly homeless, many passerbys who wanna feel a part of something,the false hope-filled aspiring youth and also those who are those involved with #3.

3. The whole cast and crew (and their families, friends, acquaintances, and possible enemies) showed up to the event - What's worse than a theater full of obnoxious people? A theater full of obnoxious people and their ""friends""/family watching a movie they were in. It's depressing since I usually express that people be proud of a hard job well done. Since this was poorly done, it doesn't apply here. The special part of the crowd spent the full time saying such insightful ""Oh look dare I am!!!"" and ""Oh snap!!!"" and ""Baby you were such a good little actress"". The wolf whistles were funny when we got to see a glimpse of Marv Blauvelt's beautiful backside but after hearing it every time an average to good looking chick or kiss was on screen gets annoying.

Oh and the director Anthony G. Sumner is a jerk. Before the screening, he pretty much informs everyone to keep their harsh criticisms to themselves and that he would just accept any applause as a job well done. After the film ended, and all the ""sheeple"" around me were clapping as though they just watched Vincent Price performing Hamlet, he had the audacity to go around surveying the audience as though he just made a film as amazing as Apocalypse. He asked me if I liked it, while sporting an evil grin, and I kindly gave him a grin right back to make it obvious that I had not enjoyed him movie and that I was ready to murder a theater full of people I hated at the moment.

So should you buy it? If you were in it, sure why not. If you have the outrageous $22.49 they are asking for as the pre-order price and you consider that to be pocket change, be my guest. If you are a horror fanatic, like myself, who will stop at nothing to own all horror ever, not like myself, then why are you reading this review? You are going to get it anyway. It's not the worst film of its type (That'd probably be Late Fee), but it still offers nothing new to a fluctuating genre.",1303171200,7,4246,4.316185696361355

8438539,1,B004QSQMKY,"Slices of Life (Anthony Sumner, 2010)

What is there to say about Anthony Metzger's mess of an attempt at a horror anthology film, Slices of Life, that hasn't already been said? One of my rules of thumb when looking at anthology films is that if your frame piece is the best thing about the movie, you have probably already failed. When your frame piece is the best thing about the movie and it's this bad, well, I'm glad someone believes in your talents, but before the next time you release something, you may want to see if you can get some sort of outside, objective validation for whether it's worth releasing (and maybe some constructive criticism on how you can make it better). I have a very hard time believing that happened here.

Whereas with many anthology films, the frame is that part the works least well (note the recent V/H/S series for excellent examples of that), here it was my favorite piece, so we'll focus on that. An amnesiac young woman, Mira (Dark Realm's Kaylee Williams), sits in a grimy hotel room obsessively drawing in a sketchbook, goaded on by motel owners Tiny (Sculpture's Marv Blauvelt) and Irma (The Door's Helene Alter-Dyche), and trying to piece together her previous life from the sketches already there, which form the bases of the other stories in the film. I'll give Slices of Life one thingthe other stories were kind of amusing, though I'm not sure comedy was what Sumner was going for here.

I am not one to criticize a low-budget film solely for it being low budget, but if you take a look back at the low-budget films I have championed over the years, there's always a feeling of less is more about them. 90% of the time (and it annoys me that every time I advance this hypothesis, it's the glaring exception of Oxygen that comes to mind) the more involved has to do with a director who went as many extra miles as necessary to find the best actors who would work for beer and pizza, or less. Noctem and Shallow Ground and Baby Blues and every movie Ricardo Islas has ever made and dozens upon dozens more are all as good as they are despite the shoestrings because while many of the actors in them are amateurs, they are very, very good amateurs who deserve to be a whole lot better known than they are. Sumner, on the other hand...well, I admire his drive and dedication, because obsessive amounts of drive and dedication are about the only way I can see someone justifying (or, more likely, overlooking) how bad some of the acting is here. And it's not a case of this one story is really horrible and the rest are pretty good, it's endemic (another reason the frame is my favorite part of this is that it features the best acting in the film by farthough that is not saying a great deal). Even in a movie with awful acting, I can overlook it if there's a factor or two on the technical end that really, really stands out, but everything here is workmanlike in its best moments and unapologetically amateur at its worstand it spends far more of its time on the latter end of that number line.

If you've got nothing better to do with a Friday night and you're really, really drunk, worth checking out for a few flashes of competence in the frame sections. Otherwise, head the other way fast. *",1393718400,,3243,4.500848896434635
8438540,3,B004QSQMKY,this movie is Meh. It harkens back to the old 'Tales From the Darkside' like stories when there are short horror films compiled into one. effects are blah and the action is meh,1373414400,,176,4.363636363636363
8438541,5,B004QSQMKY,"This movie is a nice mixture of the slasher/horror genre with enough who done it to keep you guessing.  Slices of Life was gory, but suspenseful til the end. Trying to figure out the identity of the killer was fun and made for a bit of a surprise ending.

8438545,1,B004QSQMKY,i can only imagine the reviewers giving this 5 star ratings either worked on it or are friends with people who did. i would give it 1 star for the wrap around and pink snapper only as the others aren't scary and a brain damaged idiot could predict what was coming from the very beginnings. pinksnapper boasts the best gore of any of the pieces as well but that isn't saying a whole lot. anyone who finds this to be scary really must not get out much because it isn't and there is really nothing that i haven't seen done before only better.,1318982400,2,539,4.242718446601942
8438546,4,B004QSQMKY,"SLICES OF LIFE (aka: 3 SLICES OF LIFE) is a low-low budget horror anthology. As such, it's pretty good. The wrap-around tale concerns three books which each have the title for one of the three horror stories. WORK LIFE: W.O.R.M.- A nerdy guy infects his co-workers w/ a computer ""virus"" that turns them into crazed zombies! This one is the lesser of the bunch. HOME LIFE: AMBER ALERT- A child-killer is on the loose. Meanwhile, a woman is haunted by pint-sized ghouls! I liked this story a lot! Quite macabre. SEX LIFE: PINK SNAPPER- My favorite! A brother and sister are on the run after assaulting their disgusting uncle. They wind up at a rural house with a girl locked in the basement. Unfortunately, the pair let her out and the title comes into play! Yikes! This one's a wonderfully bloody mess! Enjoy...",1313452800,5,810,4.671328671328672
