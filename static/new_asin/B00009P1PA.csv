I seriously fear I will go blind if I watch this film -- it gives me a headache just to watch a tiny bit.  No point in reviewing the film when you can't see it!  Also I suspect Alpha video masquerades under several ""imprint"" or ""distributor"" names.  I am thoroughly disgusted with them since 5 out of 6 films I got from them are similary horrid transfers.

1887218,1,B00009P1PA,"I am delighted to see the universal intolerance voiced here with SD's little DVD of one of the most important of the 1970's Italian Sex & Horror Show movies. THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE is a total classic, with a showcase appearance by Erika ""LEGS"" Blanc as a stripper involved with a plot to drive a wealthy young duke out of his skull. Classy, filled with great colorful sets, ""cool"" music and a fabulous modernist look, this is a Giallo that really isn't a Giallo at all & sort of mocks that specific sub-sect of Italian horror by having  the killer wearing yellow gardening gloves [Giallo is Italian for ""yellow""] instead of the usual sexy black variety.
With that said, you'll be better served buying one of the cheapo fullframe releases from Alpha Video or on one of the Brentwood Home Video box sets TALES FROM THE BONEYARD and FRIGHT NIGHT: This is a reburn of Sinister Cinema's DVD-R release, which suspiciously found it's way into the market about 6 - 10 weeks before this release and wasn't even transferred at the proper aspect ratio by SD, which is why the picture looks ""squished"" -- all of Sinister's widescreen releases are optimized for 16:9 screens with the flick of a switch, but sadly nobody told SD's technicians this before they ripped off the transfer.
So whatever: If you want a codefree reburn of Sinister's work that appears to have been engineered by circus chimps who had acess to DVI technology, here you go. Just be forewarned that it will look awful, you'll want your money back, and then you can come here & share your pain with us.

1887219,1,B00009P1PA,"More giallo than horror movie, Evelyn is the story of a wealthy, slightly insane London playboy who is haunted by images of dead wife.  Seeking to inherit the family fortune, his conniving cousin - teamed with a pair of London strippers - plot to drive him over the edge for good.  If you can suffer through the often tedious first hour and a half, the outrageous ending is good for a laugh or two, but otherwise there's little to recommend here.
Someone needs to talk to Sinema Diable about the quality of its products.  This DVD - like its other releases - is subpar.  The print that was used for the transfer shows a lot of wear and the sound is marginal at best, which is a little galling considering that the back cover promises ""an `All New' Gorgeous Digital Transfer.""  It may be ""all new,"" but it's far from ""gorgeous.""  There are no extras on this disc, either.  So don't expect to be wowed by the picture and sound quality or the extras.

1887222,4,B00009P1PA,"I was eagerly awaiting this film on DVD as I'm a big fan of Eurocult films and the stunning Erika Blanc. However, I was very disappointed with Eclectic DVD's treatment of its presentation.
The back of the box says it is ""letterboxed"" and presented in a ""gorgeous digitial transfer"" - both accounts are misleading. The original 2.35:1 Techniscope image is not represented correctly as the image appears 'stretched' and 'squeezed' with a fair amount of information lost on both sides. For example, the opening titles do not even fit the screen.
There is also an irritating 'grey/green' bar on the top of the screen which is persistent throughout the film. The print is very worn and scratched and seems to be from the same source used by Sinister Cinema for their VHS release many years ago.
There are no extras whatsover.
On the positive side, it does appear to be an uncut print.
I have another two titles from Eclectic - ""Vampires Night Orgy"" and ""Eerie Midnight Horror Show"" and would not recommend these titles either. If Eclectic want to satisfy us fans, they better lift their game. I would prefer to pay a bit extra for a DVD that a company has invested the time and care in releasing these gems in a transfer befitting the DVD format.",1064275200,10,1241,4.671232876712328
1887223,3,B00009P1PA,"The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave is a fairly standard Euro cult movie. Not quite a giallo but has the same style as one. The story opens with the main character, a wealthy aristocrat from a priveralged background, escaping a mental asylum then later picking up red haired woman before taking them home to his mansion/castle then whipping and finally murdering them. These scenes of course have the required nudity and have a cool if not well placed soundtrack (I am certain that one of the songs is the main theme to another film, Eugenie De Sade). We learn of course that the mans actions stem from the lost love of a woman with red hair.
After he marries a woman he meets at a party, a super natural element comes into the film as he is haughnted by the ghost of his lost love, on top oif that his new bride may be up have a sinister scheme. I won't give the story away but by the end there are many twists and turns.
While not the high art of films such as Deep Red this is still a fun Euro cult film, if you're not already a fan of these types of films you might want to remove a star from my rating however.",1060732800,3,1118,4.13302752293578
1887244,5,B00009P1PA,"Most reviews here are for DVD or Digital Video. This is for the Blu-ray.

A Giallo classic is available on blu-ray in isolation and well worth the purchase, if you don't care for the other film in the two film collection. Arrow is a rare gem in the world of film brokers. They recognize both that the two film collections often don't appeal due to a lack of desire for one film and they recognize that cost is a factor for many of us, so, they actually released this and the companion film, The Red Queen Kills Seven Times, as a set in Killer Dames and in isolation as two separate Special Edition Blu-ray releases. I bought the collection and the discs are identical.

This film, easy to find information on at IMDB and elsewhere, and as it is what it is, a classic Giallo film, there is no reason to bore you with a bunch on plot and actors. What you need to know about this Blu-ray release follows here.

First, this film contains both the original Italian audio (from the European release) and the original English audio (from the US release), so you can choose for yourself which you prefer. I've seen both, as have multiple friends, just as with Red Queen, and there is no consensus on this and likely never will be. The language preference seems to be mostly a matter of individual preference as both transfers are near flawless and sound amazing given the source material. There are new and improved English subtitles for the Italian track. As with most of these old crime/horror gems, the audio was post-looped so the Italian track often feels like the English track, in that the lip movements don't always match up. Oddly, this only seems to add to the charm of the film viewing experience.

Second, the digital restoration is beautiful. I prefer Red Queen for the color saturation. That having been said, I love both films, as movies and the color saturation in this film looks almost as good as in Red Queen. This film is a worthy effort and has, like Red Queen, been well cared for in restoration. A film like this will never be perfect, again, given the source material, but the best possible sources were used and the team restoring this did among the best restorations I have seen for something that simply can't ever look like a modern film.

Third, the special features are fantastic. The original featurettes, running around 44 minutes, are included here, as are a few new ones totally about 25 minutes. There is an audio commentary as well as an introduction on top of those.

Fourth, if you actually want to see both films, get yourself a copy of Killer Dames, for the book that comes with the two movies. But, if you don't need both, go for the individual release and buy with confidence knowing that this restoration is worthy of one of Arrow's special multi-film sets.

Good luck in making your choice.",1493942400,5,2826,4.573122529644269

This is a classic horror film, in fact it is one of the all time best, and truly one my very favorites, but with that being said this is an awful remastering of the original. The audio is off from the visual in most of the film and the film is slightly blurry through out, but despite all that this is still a cult favorite.

As an unstable British Lord mourns the loss of his deceased red headed wife who he loved dearly but didn't trust for nothing hits up the local night spots in search of fiery redheads willing to venture back to his castle for some outlandish activities. As he finally meets the second woman of his dreams (also a redhead, well kinda) he hopes she will kill the inner demons that haunt his psychopathic self. Unfortunately, the powers that be have a whole different plan.

This is a fantastic cult horror film for the ages. One that any fan of the genre could appreciate, and the only thing keeping this from being a five star review is that horrible, horrible remaster of the film.",1212883200,2,1061,4.375634517766497
1887283,5,B00009P1PA,Forget The Night Evelyn Came Out Of the Grave the transfer to DVD was bad. I never watched past the first 20 minutes or so. The real reason i picked this double disc up was for The House at the Edge the Park. David Hess the lead bad guy from Last House on the Left and Hitch Hike stars in it playing the creepy scumbag role that he does so well. A rapist and a dimwit are buddies and invite themselves to a dinner party for a group of content upperclass snobby rich kids. Soon violence and submissive sex games insue with some disturbing sadistic torture thrown in.

1887284,3,B00009P1PA,"With its lounge-lizard music, unclad beauties, bursts of violence, and potboiler plot, ""The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave"" is a respectable (if that's the right word) example of Italy's ""giallo"" genre.  Odd plot, though: the villain isn't the rich owner of the manor who lures young women to his dungeon and kills them, but the opportunists around him who try to manipulate the situation to get control of the guy's wealth.

From these Amazon reviews, it's clear there are several DVDs of this movie out there.  For what it's worth, mine featured a nice, crisp, widescreen image, an Italian soundrack with subtitles, and several extras.  So there is at least one decent DVD of this movie available for your viewing pleasure.

But, be warned (minor spoiler to follow)... even coming from a genre not known for its subtlety, you really get some over the top stuff here.  The barrel of sulfuric acid that shows up in the last minute of the movie is a particular hoot.  The scene had everything but the words ""Acme Sulfuric Acid Company"" on the side of the barrel and the villain doing an exaggerated ""oops"" double take as he pitches headlong into it.

But, in the end, hey, the movie's fun.  And that's all that counts.",1178755200,,1221,4.694835680751174
1887285,4,B00009P1PA,"Don't let the ghoulish title or the campy box fool you. ""The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave"" is no goofy zombiefest or cliched ghost story -- instead it's more of a manipulative mystery, with director Emilio Miraglia sprinkling the story with unexpected twists and giallo-like murders.

Evelyn Cunningham died in childbirth some time ago. Ever since, mentally-unbalanced Lord Alan Cunningham (Antonio De Teff) has had a nasty new hobby -- he has ""attacks"" where he lures young redheads to his rambling estate, and kills them horribly. Even a seance to contact his beloved Evelyn doesn't help his mental state.

Then he meets beautiful Gladys (Marina Malfatti), and quickly marries her. But as Alan tries to get on with his life, the castle is haunted by a red-haired, white-gowned ghost that beckons him -- and the murder of several people there. Alan is being slowly driven out of his mind, but has Evelyn come out of the grave -- or is there something even more sinister at work?

""The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave"" has many of the trappings of a giallo film -- Miraglia even gives the audience a nudge-wink by having the mystery killer wear a pair of yellow (""giallo"") gloves. But this movie isn't strictly a giallo -- more like a modern gothic with a few twists of ""House on Haunted Hill.""

It's not the best of such films -- it moves very slowly, and some of the scenes (such as the skeletal ghost-on-the-bridge scene) are just too silly. But it's made up for with some incredibly spooky ""hauntings,"" mad camerawork, and the lush interior of the crumbling castle. Miraglia even throws in some bizarre, grotesque moments, such as the disposal of a body by dumping it into a fox kennel.

And the finale is a outrageous double twist that is unlikely, but very interesting -- just when you think you've got the whole plot figured out, Miraglia yanks the rug out from under your feet. Even if the plot still has some big holes in it, it's pretty entertaining and an exciting end to a slow-moving storyline.

Teff plays the most difficult character of the piece -- his character is really psychotic at the beginning,  although by the middle of the movie he's more pitiable than detestable. Malfatti is somewhat less compelling, but does well enough as Teff's wife, while Enzo Tarascio plays the smarmy playboy very well.

It's pretty hard to find a decent print of this movie. Sinema Diablo's is horribly distorted and not worth watching, the Alpha is very bad quality, and St Clair Vision is even worse, incredibly discoloured and scratchy. The best one I've seen is from Brentwood's ""Tales From the Boneyard,"" which has excellent colour and sound, although it's a little bright at times.

""The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave"" is a lot better than its name would suggest, and its twisty spooky story is genuinely creepy in a ""giallo"" kind of way. Definitely worth watching.",1166572800,4,2887,4.746506986027944
1887286,3,B00009P1PA,"THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE is one of a class of movies that is not meant to be a pleasant diversion.  From the opening scene of the hero-villain's attempt to escape from a psychiatric asylum, one can see that he is meant as the inverse of the inner Vincent Price erudite gentleman slaughterer minus wit and charm. This wealthy count picks up hookers and disembowels them, thereby incurring the audience's disgust and odd fascination as to motive.  As the convoluted plot proceeds, the count begins to unfold his motivation like an onion.  We see Gothic paintings of his late red-haired wife who has died under mysterious circumstances.  We further see his marriage to a tall blond whose own role in the plot I shall not reveal.  There is also quite a bit of gratuitous female nudity that given the circumstances fits in nicely with the weird Eurohorror background.  Part of the problem I had, besides trying to overlook the poor quality of the film's flutterings and shoddy splicings, was the undertone of nihilism that kept me off balance.  There is at the film's core a metaphoric black hole that swallows up all morality, leaving a darkness that is as bleak as the ubiquitous greyness that smothers the flatness of the grim colors. When it was over, I had the feeling that this movie must be what the first level of Dante's Purgatory must be like.",1165622400,,1362,4.697478991596639

Since I have a region free player, I bought the X-Rated Kult DVD from Xploited Cinema. Obviously the dvd itself is uncut; and although the picture could stand to be a little more clear, for the most part it looks a lot better than the crappy Alpha version I first saw.

While I seen many movies far worse than this one, ""Evelyn"" has got to rank up (down?) there with the worst of them. First, the restless spirit is being caused by the most cliched of causes in this kind of film. Second, the character with whom we are expected to feel sympathy for is an active, masochistic serial killer who is picking up hookers and torturing them to death in his estate. Finally, the attempts at twists in the film (even beyond the ""shocking"" truth behind the walking ghost of Evelyn) are pretty much all so lame and goofy when viewed in the context of the ""hero's"" murderous actions that one has to wonder if anyone saw the entire script during production.

7992172,4,B00009P1PA,"Warning SPOILERS!!! I remember when this film was released to U.S. theaters (by Phase One Films) and being totally blown away by its poster and newspaper ads, which were very graphic for the early-'70s (or any time period, even today). This film fell into Public Domain and reportedly has nine different edits for the English language version alone, some edited so haphazardly, they make no sense, especially the TV edit titled ""Evelyn Raises The Dead"". I held off on reviewing this film until I could locate an uncut widescreen version. Imagine my surprise when I found it for free on Amazon Prime, in its original Italian language with English subtitles. It looks beautiful and if you have only seen the PD fullscreen DVD versions floating around (from Alpha Video and many of those Mill Creek and Brentwood DVD compilations), you are going to be in for a pleasant surprise.
 Lord Alan Cunningham (Anthony Steffen; CRIMES OF THE BLACK CAT - 1972) escapes from an insane asylum (by tying his sheets together) run by Dr. Richard Timberlane (Giacomo Rossi Stuart; WEEKEND MURDERS - 1970), but when he tries to climb over the asylum's front gate, he is captured by the interns. We then experience a long flashback which explains why Alan was committed to the asylum. Alan is in a car with hooker Polly (M. Teresa Toffano) and pays her 500 for sex and they go to Alan's family castle. He tells Polly that he usually doesn't come to the castle because it is full of bad memories. When Polly asks Alan about the painting of his dead wife Evelyn, he takes her to his medieval torture room (it is quite the sight), begins whipping her and then ties her up. He thinks Polly is his dead wife and he begs her to forgive him (he then has a flashback-within-a-flashback where he and his red-haired dead wife are prancing naked outside in the castle yard). He snaps back to reality, killing Polly and burning her clothes, Evelyn's brother, Albert (Roberto Maldera; NIGHT OF THE DEVILS - 1972), who is on Alan's payroll (he is the caretaker of Alan's wild foxes), watches all this happen. Alan is then visited by Richard, who is worried Alan is having ""attacks"" again because he is thinking too much about Evelyn. Alan tells Richard that everything is fine; he is going to a seance tomorrow to try and contact Evelyn. Richard leaves, telling Alan that he thinks it is not a good idea.
 We are then with Alan at the seance, joined by good friend Farley (Umberto Raho; THE EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW - 1974), Cousin George Harriman (""Rod Murdock"" a.k.a. Enzo Tarascio; THE DEAD ARE ALIVE - 1972), the wheelchair-bound Aunt Agatha (Joan C. Davies) and medium Miranda (Paola Natale; SEX OF THE DEVIL - 1971), as they try to contact the spirit of Evelyn. Just as Evelyn is about to enter Miranda's body, Albert comes into the room, shotgun in hand. He tells Alan that since Evelyn was his sister, he has the right to be here and sits next to Alan. The seance then continues and the ghost of Evelyn hoovers above the seance table, calling Alan's name. Alan faints and then Richard appears, worried about Alan's mental state. Miranda tells the doctor if Alan didn't faint, he would have been able to talk to his dead wife. Alan decides to leave the country family castle and live in the city for good, but how long will that last? Not very long. Alan tells George not to worry, he will not marry again and soon the Cunningham estate will be all his. George says he is not worried about that, he's more worried about Alan's mental state. Is he really?
 We then see what we think is a funeral, as we see people carrying a coffin and placing it on a table. It turns out to be stripper Susan's (Erika Blanc; A DRAGONFLY FOR EACH CORPSE - 1973) nightclub routine, as we watch her rise out of the coffin and remove her clothes. Alan is in the audience and is very interested in Susan (Uh, oh!). Alan buys Susan a drink (He pulls on her natural red hair thinking it is a wig. Alan has an aversion to women with red hair, as we find out later in the film.) and asks her to spend a weekend with him. Yes, they are back at the castle and the murderous rage takes over Alan. Susan does a striptease in front of Alan, so he takes her to his torture chamber, whips her and then chokes her until she passes out. He prepares a hypodermic needle, but Susan wakes up and tries to escape the castle...topless. She hides in the castle's creepy garden crypt, where Alan's ancestors are buried, but Alan injects her with something and then passes out. When he wakes up, Susan's body is gone. Albert, who was once again watching Alan the night before, makes a remark to Alan about how his wild foxes were not hungry this morning. Did Albert feed Susan's body to the foxes or did Alan? Alan pays Albert 100 and he walks away.
 Alan tells Farley to restore the castle to its former glory, money is of no consequence, but he is adamant that Farley doesn't touch the garden crypt. He even suggests to Farley to wall-up the crypt so strangers cannot break in. He gives Farley one month to restore the castle. Alan then finds Susan's heart-shaped cigarette lighter on his coffee table. How did it get there?
 At the party of the unveiling of the restored castle, Alan spots a blonde-haired young woman that catches his eye (Double Uh, Oh!). Her name is Gladys (Marina Malfatti; A BLACK RIBBON FOR DEBORAH - 1974) and that night he asks Gladys to marry him (When she asks why, he says because he wants to go to bed with her. She replies, ""If I married every man who wanted to go to bed with me, I'd never leave the church!""). He drives her home and they make love. Once again, Alan asks her to marry him and she says yes. Alan phones George and tells him that he is getting married to a woman he met three hours earlier. George is not surprised, since his cousin is quick to make snap decisions and wishes Alan well. They get married and hold the reception at the castle, where George is happy for them, but both Albert and Farley seem upset. Albert tells Alan that he shouldn't have gotten married and blames his sister's death on Alan, saying she died while trying to give him an heir (Evelyn died during childbirth. So did the baby.). Alan says he is happy and Albert shouldn't worry, he will still get his monthly check (He says, ""I can buy your conscience at any time!""). Alan and Gladys seem truly happy, but Gladys wonders why he keeps a portrait of Evelyn in their bedroom. Then some weird stuff happens in the castle, destroying the newlywed couple's happiness. Gladys tells Alan that she saw a red-haired maid in the kitchen, but Alan made sure he didn't hire a maid with red hair. As a matter of fact, all the maids in the castle look exactly alike (they all wear white wigs!), so none of them will remind Alan of Evelyn. Alan then hears his dead wife calling to him. Richard explains to Gladys how much Evelyn meant to Alan and Albert warns her to get away before it is too late. Someone wearing work gloves and carrying a deadly poisonous snake has it bite Albert on the neck, paralyzing him, then dragging his body to a freshly dug grave and burying him alive. Gladys has the cemetery custodian open Evelyn's tomb, but it is empty, Evelyn's body missing. Aunt Agatha discovers all the priceless silverware, which has been part of the Cunningham family for over three centuries, has been stolen. Someone then kills Aunt Agatha in her wheelchair as she is following Gladys, who is searching the Cunningham family crypt. What is she looking for? (and, no, it's not for Richie Cunningham's brother! [an old joke]) When Alan discovers what she is doing, he slaps the stuffing out of Gladys, but George stops him. At the same time, someone dumps Aunt Agatha's dead body in the fox cage, the little creatures turning her into a tasty meal.
 The police are called in and Richard shows up at the castle to calm Alan down. Is Alan involved in these murders or is something more sinister at work? If you have read any of my other giallo film reviews, you know I never give away the killer's identity, but I have given you more than enough clues for you to figure out on your own.
 This is actually a horror film with giallo genre overtones. If all you have ever seen were the washed-out fullscreen P.D. prints (including a VHS tape from VCI Home Video), you are doing yourself a total disservice because you should view the uncut, widescreen version, available on DVD from NoShame Films (as part of ""The Emilio Miraglia Killer Queen Box Set"", which is long OOP), Blu-Ray from Arrow Video or streaming on Amazon Prime (which is how I viewed it). It's like watching a different film, especially Alan's failed escape from the asylum, which takes full advantage of the widescreen process. Director/co-screenwriter Emilio P. Miraglia (THE RED QUEEN KILLS SEVEN TIMES - 1972) uses the castle's exteriors and interiors to his advantage, filling the entire screen with vital information, giving the castle a presence all its own. While the reveal of the killer(s) is hardly a revelation, the film is beautiful to look at and the surprise finale is just that, a surprise. Filled with full-frontal male and female nudity (edited out of the R-rated theatrical print, as were the coffin striptease and much of the torture dungeon footage) and bursts of gory violence (especially the shots of the foxes feasting on Aunt Agatha's body). Shot Under the title LA NOTTE CHE EVELYN USCI DALLA TOMBA (a literal translation of the review title), this is a great way to spend 103 minutes. The wild screenplay is by Miraglia, Massimo Felisatti (STRIP NUDE FOR YOUR KILLER - 1975) & Fabio Pittorru (WHEN WOMEN PLAYED DING DONG - 1971). Also starring Montinaro Brizio and Ettore Bevilacqua as the Cemetery Custodian. Not Rated.",1525392000,,9756,4.577803203661327

Total crap. The guy is soaking wet with sulfuric acid on him and the police are holding him without being burned themselves? The death scenes--especially with the snake--were so melodramatic that I laughed. The antihero--a crusty, old has-been--gets away in the end. Stupid.
