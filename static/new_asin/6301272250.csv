326954,2,6301272250,"Only watch this movie if you are a major fan of any of the actors, or are purposely trying to watch crappy 80's horror films. I did not find this movie at all scary, but then, I'm not really sure it was supposed to be... Expect lots of bizarre camera angles (including the doorknob-cam, for example), and very stilted dialogue. On the other hand, I still very much enjoyed this movie, and have watched it several times since buying it. It's best to watch it really late at night. If you want to watch Sam Raimi (""Spiderman"" movie director) act, this is the movie for you. If you want all the characters to live happily ever after, it is not for you. Infamous B-movie icon Bruce Campbell makes a brief (i.e. not longer than three minutes) appearance at the end, so don't be fooled by how often his name shows up headlining the credits. I personally bought this movie for the combined five minutes of Ted Raimi (Sam's little brother). He violences vegetables (and an innocent and unsuspecting watermelon), and bleeds very enthusiastically; unfortunately he is not a major character... The multiple deaths are not as explicit as they would be in a modern horror film, but they are creative; the blood content is rather moderate in most of them. I enjoyed it, despite its faults, and if you're in the right mood, you might, too.",1176249600,3,1324,4.614406779661017
326955,5,6301272250,"Intruder should have been called Halloween In A Supermarket. It's a scary slasher movie from a time when slashers were fun and gory. The first half hour is kind of slow, not boring just slow. However, after that it's non-stop horror as a killer stalks the employees at a grocery store that is going out of business. The twist ending is clever and sets up a sequel. I don't understand why there hasn't been a sequel to this, considering that it's better than about half of the Friday the 13th series. If the flick had some nudity, it would a perfect slasher movie. As it is, it's an almost perfect slasher movie.",1158019200,7,611,4.464285714285714
326956,3,6301272250,"Although starts off slowly this above average b-movie really packs a gory punch in the last 35 minutes or so.. The acting is what you might expect from an 80's horror flick but, who is watching these movies for the performances? However, I think the girl that was killed should have taken the leading role. Now.. here is a little something that bugs me about alot of companies that produce films to dvd. Bruce Campbell is in this movie for two minutes and for some strange marketing reason he is listed as the star of the film. Why? I really hate that. I love Campbell but, i don't like when I am led to believe that he plays a significant role in a movie and he is in it for a two minute ""cop"" role at the end of the movie. Anyway.. if you haven't seen ""Intruder"" it takes place in a supermarket while the 3rd shift crew stocks, changes prices and, cleans. They all get more than they ""bargain"" for when they are told that the store will be closing in a month and their jobs will be lost. On top of the bad news a psychotic killer is picking them off one by one. The deaths are gruesome. Especially two in particular. One involves a butchers electric meat cutter, the other involves a box recycling bin. Over all I give this movie 3 stars and a half.. definitely elevated by it's gory deaths!! Fun Stuff!",1156464000,14,1305,4.287449392712551
326957,3,6301272250,"There's only two reasons to see this film - the ""meat cutter"" scene, and Sam Raimi is in it.

If cheesy 80's slasher flicks, with bad acting, are your thing, this movie is right up your alley. The DVD release of this film is a mixed bag. I'm glad they finally presented it in it's original form with all the gore intact. However the packaging of it is awful. The cover depcts a silouhette of someone with an axe, yet the killer in this movie doesn't even use one. Worse yet; the movie *tries* to keep you guessing as to who the killer is, but if you flip the DVD case over and glance at the pics on the back, it blows it and shows you who is the killer.

That said, there is a GREAT scene where someone gets their head cut apart on a meat cutter. I remember reading about this scene in Fangoria back in the day, where they mentioned how much work went into making it. I was really dissapointed to find out it was edited out of the VHS version that originally came out. However, the dvd has this scene in all it's glory. In addition, there is a lengthier meat cleaver scene towards the end, that was originally toned down in the first release of the film.",1145664000,5,1154,4.170403587443946
326958,4,6301272250,"Intruder is alot of fun to watch. It has all the ingrediants of what a low budget horror film should have... silly dialogue, pretty girls, scares (well, a few) and lots of humor.  The inventive camera angles give the flick additional demension as well.  The cherry topper....a cameo from Emil Sitka.",1141344000,4,299,4.8431372549019605
326959,2,6301272250,"At the beginning, this is a promising little slasher film, typical of the eighties.  Put a bunch of people in an isolated setting, then start killing them.  And though the budget was obviously low and the story a bit silly, I still found it amusing.

Then came the last twenty minutes or so where the killer is chasing one girl back and forth through the supermarket.  Back and forth.  Back and forth.  It just got boring.  Then comes the ""Twist"" ending, which everyone will see coming.  By the end, I was just a little annoyed with this film, so I can't give it three stars.  More like 2.5.

Bruce Campbell is in it for maybe a minute at the end, but he is the best thing in it.

Also, in the pantheon of super strong serial killers, this guy has got to be one of the strongest.  He might even give Jason Vorhees a run for his money.",1137888000,2,834,4.208860759493671
326960,3,6301272250,"A slasher movie set entirely inside a supermarket on the night shift.  Cool idea and for the obviously low budget this film does pretty good.  It's no FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3 but I've definitely seen worse.  NIGHT SCHOOL anyone?

Opening with the store closing one of the cashier's ex-boyfriend comes to visit her fresh out of prison (for murder) and starts a fight.  He gets kicked out, but soon the night shift crew starts getting offed in imaginative ways (trash compactor decapitation, head sawed in half, eyeball stabbing).  Could it be the ex-boyfriend?  Or is it someone else?  Who cares as long as the bodies keep piling up.  And pile up they do pretty good there for awhile but the Final Girl bit drags out too long.

Worth checking out if you like slasher flicks.  I enjoyed it and got a few giggles out of it. Also Bruce Campbell is only in the film for maybe a minute and the last minute at that.",1137888000,2,907,4.4363636363636365
326961,3,6301272250,"Intruder is a ""love story"" about one cashier at a po-dunk supermarket and her ex-boyfriend/ex-con that still loves her. Sadly, she doesn't love him anymore. Maybe it has to do with the fact that she broke up with him a year ago and he just can't say goodbye? Its possible. That doesn't matter to him though. He goes to such lengths to prove he still loves her that he calls her repeatedly and gets in a brutal fight with her boss and co-workers while she is working...but not before socking her across the face. Ahh, young love.

On top of all of this she and her fellow employees find out their much loved place of employment is being sold to another company and the store will be shut down indefinitely within a month. While nowadays this would be met with as much concern by a supermarket employee as finding out your much hated enemy has contracted syphilis apparently jobs were so scare in 1988 that the girl's boss offers to give her a ""recommendation for a job at another supermarket"". As if this idea wasn't scary enough...somebody is stalking around the inside of the store killing each one of them off. Is it the ex-boyfriend???

Intruder is far from a masterpiece but is a good enough slasher flick to elicit shocks and laughs in abundance. While the ""plot"" isn't all that original there is a lot in Intruder that is. It is obvious that the director (Scott Spiegel, good friend of Sam Raimi and co-writer of Evil Dead II) was heavily influenced by Raimi. Some of the shots that he uses are totally bizarre (including the first ever shot up through the dial of a rotary phone!) and absolutely does not skimp with the gore. At least in this uncut version that is.

In many ways though this film is also a spoof of the slasher subgenre itself. 90% of the victims in this movie are male and I challenge anybody not to laugh as the ""Mystery Killer"" slowly drags off the screaming, writhing men to their ghastly fates. It also illustrates how nobody in slasher movies ever seems to attempt to defend themselves (except of course, for the heroine) even though their life is quite obviously about to be snuffed out in the grisliest way possible (a trash compactor and infamously, a band saw to name a few). If the movie played in total seriousness it would be funny enough as it is and just plain sad...but due to the over-the-top quality of the movie it all comes out as just plain funny. It is obvious the filmmakers just want to have a bloody good time and you can't help but be infected by it about halfway through the film.

The stand-out performance in this film belongs to Dan Hicks (and on a smaller scale The Brothers Raimi). Many of you will probably remember him for his role as Jake the redneck tow-truck driver in Evil Dead 2 (""BOBBY JOEEEEEEEE!!!""). After watching his totally goofy/fun performance it is an honest to god crime that he hasn't had bigger parts in more movies.

If you like absolutely ridiculous slasher films (and you can make it through some initial bloodless corniness) then Intruder shouldn't disappoint.

(NOTE: The back of the DVD refers to an ""Ex-cop trying to figure out why these killings are going on"" or something along those lines. This is totally false and I have no clue why this is there. The whole movie takes place in its entirety within the confines and surrounding areas of the supermarket and there is no ex-cop subplot. Also, on the back of the DVD there is a ""still"" of Bruce Campbell in one scene that is an obvious facsimile to make you think he is in the movie for more than 60 seconds. If you buy this movie because of any of the previous two misnomers you will be a tad ticked off. Other than that however...watch it.)",1125964800,17,3677,4.513513513513513
326962,3,6301272250,"Since this is a slasher movie, I'll keep this short.  Suffice to say, this film is utterly generic in all ways except that which I'm about to mention: Odd camerawork, and particularly gruesome violence.  This isn't a great film, or even a great slasher film, but it's worth seeing.

This was directed by Scott Spiegel, famed for his connection to Evil Dead II.  Clearly, some of Raimi's directorial tendencies have rubbed off on Spiegel, as he inserts lots of senseless, unusual camera-angles.  He's not as kinetic, or as big on moving it around, but he actually tops Raimi in terms of sheer gratuity, as exemplified by the stangest shot of the film, which is within a telephone, looking up at someone through the holes in the mechanism.

This movie is most famed for it's gore, and not with out good reason.  Though it's got a fairly low-body count, it's makes almost all of them matter, including a horrific eye-skewering, head crushing by trash compactor, a gruesome hook the the face, and a truly brutal scene of one character having their head sawed in half.  The gore isn't up to modern, mainstream standards of realism, but it's really quite impressive for a very low-budget film from the 80's.  Sadly, the kills are clustered together too closely, as they often are in slasher movies.  Still, they deliver, even if they could be spread out a bit more.

This DVD is in fact available now, though I won't say where as this would doubtless be against Amazon.com policy. (It ain't at all tough to find, however.  You don't need my help.)  It looks more or less like crap, but it is uncut, so it's a vast improvement over any other legitimate American VHS releases.

Definitely a reasonable way to pass 85 or so minutes.

326963,4,6301272250,"This movie is very well filmed and directed. There's so many unusual camera angles! The death scenes are also very gory and detailed which is very cool. The stunts in this film are kind of bad. You can tell when the killer isn't hit by the bottle. The ending is somewhat predictable but still fun to watch. This movie is also very orginal. Usually a typical 80's slasher takes place in house, well this takes place in a supermarket.

As another reviewer said, though, the currently streaming version cuts out some of the parts that led me to rent this movie. Specifically, the bandsaw scene. I figured the reviewers I listened to may have exaggerated what happened, and the amount of gore in the film, but they did not and all of the goriest parts are on YouTube.

326997,5,6301272250,"The night crew of the Malnut Lake Market is preparing to close down for the night and begin stocking and re-shelving for the next day. Among the workers is Jennifer Ross, who encounters are psychotic ex, Craig Peterson, the final minutes the store is opened and gets into a physical altercation with him. More devastation occurs moments later, when they're all informed that the store is closing down in the next month and they'll all be without jobs.

With a rather unexpected and crazy closing shift to kick things off, the night crew is about to learn that a crazy ex boyfriend and an upcoming permanent shut down of their job is about to be the least of their worries. As they go on about their business, they suddenly find themselves being stalked by a would-be intruder, lurking the premises of the store--inside and out, hacking and dicing the night crew in some of the goriest ways possible. Who is this knife/cleaver wielding lunatic and why are they out to pick off simple night crew teens of a supermarket?

Overall: Intruder is probably one of the more forgotten slashers from the 80s decade. It's a fast paced horror/thriller with little to complain about. The killings in this movie are pretty gruesome to say the least. I won't go into detail as not to give anything away, but I'll just way they're brutal and the producer got pretty plasma happy. There are a few funny scenes throughout though (e.g. a victim getting beat with a severed head) that I can't tell if they're supposed to be intentionally funny or not. If you're watching Intruder for the first time, I advise you NOT to watch the trailer as it unwisely gives away who the killer is. Despite knowing who the killer was, it was still quite fun to watch the entire thing unravel. Unlike a lot of the teen slashers of the 80s, this film isn't plagued with sex-driven teens with no redeeming qualities. In fact, most of the characters in this film are sympathetic characters with maybe the exception of 1 or 2. Overall, anyone that loves 80s slashers and is looking for a somewhat standout film of that genre, should give Intruder a watch",1467244800,,2112,4.644385026737968

In Scott Spiegel's somewhat unassuming directorial debut, ""Intruder,"" the night crew at a supermarket find themselves locked in with a mysterious madman on the prowl. Is it a jilted ex-boyfriend of one of the cashiers? A disgruntled customer who waited too long in line behind the old lady who paid in pocket change? The guy from the opening scene in ""Cobra""?

""Intruder"" offers a little mystery to the proceedings, which can often feel like a paint-by-numbers slasher. Spiegel, who spent a considerable amount of time working with the ""Evil Dead"" crew of Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, et al brings some familiar faces along, as well as a few tricks up his sleeve. What ""Intruder"" may lack in originality, it delivers in physical humor, creative camera angles and some unbelievably over-the-top death scenes. Its cast is mostly unknown (featuring a few cameos here and there you may recognize) and yet perfectly capable. Really, the cast is likeable and they add to the underdog charm of the film which, let's face it, was never meant for ""classic"" status.

Fans of the genre will find many things to like about ""Intruder"" (which originally went by the much superior and much less generic title of ""The Night Crew"") and if you've seen enough slashers, you'll forgive its shortcomings for the amount of ingenuity the film works into its limited means. Just an all around pleasant stroll through the aisles of yesterday's slasher oeuvre, be sure to throw ""Intruder"" in the cart if you haven't already.

Okay, one more: Tonight, the stock-boy will be the one being stalked! No? Okay, I'll leave now.",1458345600,2,1764,4.909395973154362

Although the ""poster art"" states that the movie is the ""unrated Director's Cut"", it isn't. Therefore, all of the good special effects by Tom Savini's SFX shop are cut short, which is a shame. As to the movie itself, there are some good performances in here, and not just by people you know like the Raimis Ted and Sam, Bruce ""The Chin"" Campbell (for two whole minutes!). There is some interesting camera work as well. One shot in particular was the point of view of the phone being used to call the police. All in all, it's good cheezy fun, but I paid to see the Director's Cut, and I won't be satisfied until I get it.",1456012800,7,730,4.335766423357664
327018,5,6301272250,"Intruder is a fun and delightfully gory late 80s slasher that perfectly exemplifies the direction the sub-genre took from the more somber and intense early 80s entries. These flicks now had a sense of humor about themselves and were far more self-aware than the ones that were inspired by Halloween and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. These films were more colorful, focused far more on bloody body count and were made knowing there was a slasher/horror savvy audience watching and openly acknowledged the films that came before them.

This film takes place at the Walnut Lake Market where the night crew is closing up and getting the store ready for when it reopens the following morning. But, the mood is somber as the employees have been informed that the store is being sold and they soon will be out of jobs that and pretty cashier Jennifers (Elizabeth Cox) thug ex-boyfriend Craig (David Byrnes) is out of jail and is harassing her at the store. But, soon the night shift becomes a nightmare as someone is stalking the employees one by one and slaughtering them in the most gruesome ways. Is it the spurned ex-con Craig? or is there someone else out there with a grudge against the market and demented enough to kill them all. Will any of them escape The Walnut Lake Market alive?

Written and directed by Scott Spiegel from a story by he and producer Lawrence Bender, this flick is a whole lot of slasher flick fun. The proceedings are taken seriously but, the film is written and directed with a wink to the audience that the filmmakers know they are watching and know what to expect and they are going to get it, covered in buckets of blood. The film is not very suspenseful but, does have some nice atmosphere, thanks in part to Fernando Argelles cinematography and a cool score by the great Basil Poledouris. Its made with the understanding that you know whose getting it and when and now its the anticipation as to see which gruesome manner it should be the ban saw, the butcher knife, the trash compactor or all of the above? And we get those gruesome kills with some delightfully nostalgic prosthetics and gallons of blood. The film knows the premise that no one notices they are being offed one by one or hears any of the screams is ridiculous but, goes with it, yet, never makes a joke out of it. Spiegel takes a likable bunch of young working stiffs and decimates them effectively in the setting of the empty grocery store and has a good time doing and so do we. The slasher formula is followed well and the film never insults us by assuming we haven't seen it all before. In fact, the nods and winks to the genre make this ooze with nostalgia all these years later as, it is both slasher and slasher homage all in one.

Getting back to the likable bunch of employees/victims Elizabeth Cox makes a solid lead. Shes pretty, perky and when she finally realizes whats going on, she is a resilient heroine as is part of the slasher tradition. Sam and Ted Raimi have small parts as butcher and produce workers respectively and the tools of their trade make the killers job a lot easier. Craig Stark is fine as Tim, a potential love interest for Jennifer and pretty much the male lead. David Byrnes is appropriately slimy as Craig who is obviously, as dictated by the formula, being set up as our #1 suspect. The rest of the supporting cast are also lively in their cliche roles which includes fun cameos by Spiegel, Bender and horror icon Bruce Campbell.

I had a real blast with this film. I love the 80s era horror and this flick not only is one, but, its self-aware tone sets it up as a homage as well, which makes it a fun nostalgic viewing all these years later! In fact, I will go as far too say that it probably works far better now as homage than it did back then, at a point when the slasher genre was burning itself out. Its got plenty of inventive and very gory kills and while it concentrates more on killing off its cast than trying to generate any real tension, it gets away with it by being obvious about its intentions and having fun with the fact that it respects that this is not the first horror flick we have all seen. A fun, deviously gory slasher flick that all these years later now works as a nostalgia filled homage, as well as, a fun horror flick. A very underrated and entertaining 80s slasher.",1452384000,6,4326,4.5

The killer uses various things you'd find at the market to kill, knives, meat cleaver, meat hook, box crusher ect..& its all very gory with some nice effects. Story is some employees are working late in a supermarket that's going to close for good soon & someone starts killing them off. There is also a bit of twist & it has you think 1 person is the killer when its someone else, I thought that was very well done. I liked the cast & especially the killer, he just acted so nuts it was great. So in short, good kills, nice gore effects, decent story & a cameo by Bruce Campbell.

327049,3,6301272250,"I've seen thousands of horror films and TV episodes over the past 40 years. I've taped off of TV, repurchased them on Beta, re-repurchased them on VHS, and re-re-repurchased them on DVD. I'm even downloading some of them off of YouTube.

You know, not every horror film requires a Blu-ray edition. DVD or VHS or even YouTube is good enough. If you've never seen Intruder, and have money to burn, go ahead and buy this Blu-ray. Otherwise, buy a cheap used DVD.

Intruder is a mediocre slasher film. It's good. I like it. I've watched it several times. (But that doesn't mean anything -- I've watched tons of mediocre horror films several times. That's what hardcore fans do.) But I wouldn't overpay for a Blu-ray of Intruder.

Essentially, you have some mediocre actors playing grocery store employees. It's the last night before the store shuts for good. There's a killer stalking the aisles, picking off the employees one by one. Yes, it's the usual variety of gory methods. Lots of killing tools in a grocery store. Meat hook, salami slicer, box cutter, letter spike, etc. There's a red herring, someone we're supposed to think is the killer, but isn't. Most memorable about this film are some cutesy, trick shots. Such as the killer's face seen through a large container of water, distorting his face in an unsettling manner. There's also a ""surprise"" ending, variations of which we've seen in other slasher films (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dorm-That-Dripped-Blood/dp/B004GF3IJU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dorm That Dripped Blood</a>, another okay film that doesn't deserve Blu-ray.)

There are a few horror films I've re-purchased on Blu-ray because the visuals are so compelling, or because they're simply personal favorites --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Unseen/dp/B00DELK9Z8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Unseen</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ring/dp/B00AEFYYA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ring</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suspiria/dp/B00UXZG6U0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suspiria</a>).

I had never heard of the movie and being a fan of the Michigan Boys - Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi I picked it up.  Sam was a victim and Bruce showed up for a cameo at the end of the film.  Ted Raimi was also in the film as Produce Joe who was another victim.  Ted has a way of just sort of stealing his scenes with his crazy characters.

This one isn't for fans of creepy mood and atmosphere, unless you find a grocery store and a few parking lot scenes eerily unnerving  There's no real ""T & A"" factor as is usually drizzled into these types of films. We have to settle for ""segway shots"" for the first couple of kills, but then finally, and thankfully, the kills start paying off for us gorehounds.

327124,3,6301272250,"This movie devotedly follows that oft used formula that requires a bunch of people be trapped in one location so they can conveniently get picked off one by one.  The killer also hides the bodies then stages them later.  As with other films of this kind, an obvious suspect is designated at the very start.  When the `real' killer is finally revealed they abruptly turn this killer into a cartoonish version of the typical CRAZED killer (virtually a new character).  And while I appreciate the unexpurgated version of the killings, the fact remains that there's way too much banality to wade through before the killing spree begins.  Why they thought the boring tete-a-tete between coworkers would be of any interest is a complete mystery to me.  They literally padded the first half of this movie with scenes like this.  It was like watching stakeout footage of a boss trying to catch his employees in the act of stealing, which is exactly what they were doing.  All the while an obvious score signals each sequence of menace with a loud THRUMMMM sound.  At the same time someone went crazy with a hodgepodge of bizarre camera angles and tricks that prove more distracting then clever.  If that's what they were hoping would set them apart from a sea of other slasher flicks, then they definitely get points for being pretentious but not that different from the rest.

The original title was The Night Crew, which made more sense than the ambiguous title Intruder (which sounds like a home invasion scenario).
I was amused to note they listed an acting coach among the credits.  Yeah, well, someone failed to do their job.

I've seen this movie twice, debated keeping it, decided against it as there are so many other films out there that do the job better than this film does.

327172,3,6301272250,"Taking place in a supermarket, this slasher has no nudity; this isn't the norm for an 80s slasher. While the body count and gore are good, I thought some of the black comedy elements towards the end hurt the film. There's plenty of gore, so that should satisfy slasher fans. However, it doesn't deliver effective atmosphere because the film is confined to this one location in the supermarket with only some small bits taking place outside the place. Some of the soundtracks I liked and some I didn't, and I thought the directing  and pace are good. It isn't a disturbing slasher, and there isn't really anything interesting about the characters. It's simply a gory slasher flick that separates itself to some extent from other 80s slashers by providing a different setting, having no nudity, and delivering some graphic deaths that are different compared to many other 80s slasher films.

The DVD I'm reviewing is the old Wizard DVD. I'll eventually get the new release from Synapse because this needs to be seen in better quality. The quality on this old DVD looks like it's from a VHS master. The quality is acceptable, but this is one of those films that will be much more enjoyable in better quality.

327190,5,6301272250,"Featuring a number of graphic and nasty kills, Intruder (1989) is a film that really delivers, in the violence and gore departments, as the director's cut, restores the graphic scenes previously cut for ratings.  Writer/director Scott Spiegel's film, has a darkly humorous tone, as the not especially bright employees of a supermarket, are systematically murdered, using kitchen implements, and various tools and equipment found in the store.  If you appreciate a dementedly fun bloodbath, this film will simply be a delight.

The Walnut Lake Market is about to close for the night, when Craig Peterson (David Byrnes), an ex-con, enters the store to confront Jennifer (Elizabeth Cox), a cashier he once dated.  When Peterson gets violent, the other employees toss him out of the store.  After the market is closed, Danny (Eugene Glazer) and Bill (Dan Hicks), the two owners, gather the night crew together, to announce that they will all soon be losing their jobs, because the store is being sold.  While the employees work through the night, a mysterious figure begins to kill them off, in some horrific and brutal ways, including using a band saw, and a trash compactor.  The killer is into dismembering, as heads, hands, and feet, wind up in some strange places.  As the body count rises, the suspense builds nicely.  Final girl Jennifer battles the relentless killer, struggling frantically to survive, as the film concludes on a devilishly dark note.

A fine example of 80's style horror, Intruder makes no pretense about being serious about anything other than the bloody demise of the staff, who stumbling around in near darkness, are easy prey.  Some of the action is pretty clumsy in execution, but the gore and practical effects are nicely done, as kitchen equipment is employed in some macabre ways.  The violence is usually directed at the head, including eye trauma, a meat hook into the jaw, a head crushed until it explodes, and a severed head used as a weapon.  The acting isn't very impressive, and the dialog is often weak, but the film does feature some really neat camerawork.

Intruder is a classic 80's slasher that really deserves more recognition, and the director's cut is definitely the way it should be seen.  For the hardcore fan, the two disc Bluray release from Synapse, might be the way to go, but for those with a more casual interest, the no frills release by Wizard Entertainment may suffice.",1371168000,2,2426,4.955555555555556

A highly entertaining and intense 1988 slasher shocker co-written and directed by Scott Spielgel (Co-writer of Evil Dead 2) and produced and co-written by Lawrence Bender (Pulp Fiction, From Dusk Till Dawn, Inglorious Bastards and more).

The acting is typical b-movie but the film offers scares and gruesome thrills with intensity to the very end, it was originally titled ""Night Crew"" but when Paramount bought it for a direct to video release than a theatrical one it was decided that had a different more marketable title like ""Intruder"" unfortunately it was cut to bits with some of the graphic kills chopped up for an R-rating. It took until 2005 for the director's cut to come and it did, i remembered renting this back in 1989 when i was 7 and thought it was a creepy yet very cool slasher film but glad in 2005 that the director's cut came out on DVD with all the gore restored to it's unrated glory.

This blu-ray/DVD combo offers a crisp and excellent picture transfer guaranteed to please videophiles out there and is free of grain with superb surround sound in English 2.0 mono in DTS plus the film is in it's unrated uncut director's cut. The extras are jaw-dropping as much as the blu-ray's picture is as it has featurette/retrospective making of, outtakes from the lost short film that inspired this film, extended murder scenes from the original workprint, audio commentary with Scott Spiegal and Lawrence Bender, original cast audition footage, 2 trailers and behind the scenes still gallery. It's a definite bargain and a must have for fans of high def horror and slasher films no doubt as this one will surprise you.",1368316800,4,2512,4.772413793103448

Basically the plot is a guy stalking all there grocery store employees in a super market. The camera work is very well done and has some style to it like the Evil Dead franchise (the director of this also I think worked on those too with Sam Rami who is also in this movie along with his brother so that's cool). Now with this being said as an awesome slasher film be warned that this is the WORST version of this film. This version that Amazon has on it's instant movies is horrible compared to the special edition blu-ray that I just purchased. Like I said this is the WORST version of the film. DO NOT RENT IT. Go out and buy the blu-ray version instead because it's so worth the money with all kinds of extra goodies and it looks fantastic.

Well, I think it's a small miracle to make a watchable film with no money, no known stars, and an empty old grocery store.  Any young filmmaker should watch this as a lesson in writing a simple script that keeps you involved and makes good use of limited scenery...very limited scenery.  No wonder Scott Spiegel went on to produce, direct, and rub shoulders with Sam Raimi, Quentin Tarantino, and Eli Roth.  Check him out on the Wiki.",1360368000,,506,4.5777777777777775

The story goes... It's the night before Walnut Lake's neighborhood supermarket closes its doors forever due to a windfall that the owners are supposedly hoping to net. The owners and night crew have a long shift ahead of them. Ace check-out girl, Jennifer (played by Lethal Weapon's Renee Estevez), has a deranged ex-boyfriend who's fresh out of prison. When he appears outside, weird things start happening. The phone lines are cut, and the night crew starts dying one by one. An ex-cop is trying to find out who the killer is and what possessed him to start the bloody rampage. In the end, it wasn't the deranged boyfriend and you'll have to watch it to find out more. Sam Raimi is good in one of his only acting gigs but Bruce Campbell is in the film for literally under 3 minutes.

I guess do to Halloween they decided to sell horror films and surprisingly, they had really rare and hard to find films. I ended up buying several rare dvds that day, much to my delight :). Anyways, I'm glad i finally got around to watching it.

I'm not going to get into details because I would be giving a lot of parts away, but this slasher film takes place in a store that is about to be sold to the city. A deranged boyfriend, who is fresh out of jail for murder, decides to visit his ex-girlfriend and begins to harass her in front of all the employees. A big fight breaks out and he was kicked out of the store.  He begins stalking his ex from outside and soon after, employees begin to get hacked to pieces! The desolate vibe from a night shift grocery store sets a perfect atmosphere for murder.

The effects were great, in my opinion. Some scenes were really gory and realistic! One of the employees gets his head crushed by what looked like a trash baylor and man was it awesome! Another scene I enjoyed was when another employee gets his face sliced by a meat slicer, very realistic and well done. If gore is your thing, definitely check out this film.

Overall this film was well put together. Everything from the camera views to the execution of the plot. The actors were great as well and really helped sell the ""psychotic"" factor of the movie. As far as the ending goes, it certainly did not disappoint. I recommend you watch this film!",1352505600,2,1618,4.383333333333334

What happens when the overnight employees of a local grocery store that's closing down are stalked by a crazed, bloodthirsty killer?  Ridiculous blood-letting that's what!  Though it takes some time to get going, Intruder features some inventive kills (with early effects work from KNB) and even performances from Evil Dead trilogy mastermind Sam Raimi and his brother Ted.  Synapse Films has thankfully released the film in all its uncut gory glory, with a decent amount of special features that will satisfy gore hounds aplenty.

327231,4,6301272250,"As a teenager, director Scott Spiegel made Super-8 home movies with his pals Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. And, like his talented friends, he went on to make films professionally, mostly for the direct-to video market. His first full-length feature was the supermarket-set stalk and slay thriller, INTRUDER (a/k/a THE NIGHT CREW, 1989), making its uncut home video debut on Blu-ray & DVD this week, courtesy of Synapse Films.

The evening shift employees at a small Michigan supermarket, have closed and locked the doors, and have been ordered by their bosses to conduct an all-night inventory in preparation for the store's imminent closing and sale. As the night crew set about their work, a shadowy intruder moves silently among them, and before long, the young staff finds themselves being brutally murdered, one by one.

Spiegel's film came out near the end of the 80s slasher cycle, and while there's really not anything particularly original about the story, it does have an engaging sense of dark humor, and a lively visual style, both of which were also evident in the director's later films, like FROM DUSK TIL DAWN 2 and HOSTEL PART 3. Produced and co-written by Lawrence Bender (PULP FICTION), the witty and suspenseful low-budget film also benefits from an interesting cast comprised of up and coming young actors including Rene Estevez (SLEEPAWAY CAMP), Elizabeth Cox (NIGHT OF THE CREEPS), and Ted Raimi (THE GRUDGE), director/buddySam Raimi (THE EVIL DEAD, SPIDER-MAN) and a last-reel cameo by Bruce Campbell (TERMINAL INVASION, BURN NOTICE).

Before its original release, the movie earned a bit of notoriety from a Fangoria magazine photo spread that showcased its graphic gore effects, executed by then-newcomers Robert Kurtzman, Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger (soon to be known as KNB and renowned for their effects make-up in films like FROM DUSK 'TIL DAWN, HOSTEL and TV's THE WALKING DEAD). Unfortunately, when it was released on VHS by Paramount, virtually all of that material was excised, severely undercutting the film's effectiveness, and leaving its intended audience disappointed and dissatisfied.

This new Blu-ray/DVD Combo from Synapse finally brings INTRUDER to home video as it was intended to be seen, with every blood-soaked kill and gory thrill intact.

The Blu-ray disc sports a very solid, 1.78.1 widescreen, 1080p HD transfer that looks pretty good for a 20+ year-old, $130,000 indie horror film. Audio is a perfectly satisfactory, DTS-HD MA Mono. (The enclosed DVD is in Standard def, 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 2.0 Mono audio.) Bonus features include an energetic and entertaining audio commentary by Spiegel and Bender; SLASHED PRICES, a terrific retrospective documentary featuring most of the cast and key crew members; extended effects footage from the original workprint; outtakes from Spiegel's 8mm version of the story, NIGHT CREW; original casting tapes; theatrical and VHS trailers, a still gallery, and a video interview with INTRUDER fan and filmmaker, Vincent Periera.

As I mentioned above, the story's not particularly fresh, and the actual filmmaking is a little crude, with the low-budget and general inexperience of the director evident in the final product. But it's fast-paced and suspenseful, several of the ""kills"" are real show-stoppers, and it's honestly entertaining in a way that a lot of slicker, more-polished fright flicks aren't. Synapse's new edition is terrific, and highly recommended to 80s horror fans.",1328659200,,3492,5.34

327254,5,6301272250,"I remember reading about ""Intruder"" in various horror film magazines and horror film websites over the years --- reading about how Sam Raimi, Ted Raimi, Dan Hicks, and Bruce Campbell (the people involved with ""Evil Dead 2"") all having individual roles in the film --- reading about how all the pretty decent gore effects have been cut from the final version of the film --- never being able to find a copy of the film on VHS, DVD, or Blu-Ray anywhere!!!

Well, all I have to say is ""Thank God, for Synapse Films!"" The brillant minds at Synapse have finally released a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack of ""Intruder"" in a Director's Cut version with all the blood and mayhem beautifully restored back into the film! If you are a fan of 80's slasher cinema, then picking this up is a no-brainer!

The plot of ""Intruder"" is simple and to-the-point: A group of people working the late-shift at the Walnut Lake Supermarket in Michigan are slowly being killed off one-by-one in gruesome ways by a mysterious killer that has entered the store!

Seeing this movie for the first time ever, in the version of the way it was meant to be seen, and on Blu-Ray was a total blast! You can tell the cast and crew had to have had a good time making this flick and it totally shows! And as for the gore effects...they are AWESOME for a low-budget slasher flick like this!

This is a perfect film to watch when you have friends over for beer and pizza! And all I have to say about the ending is ---> ""WOW! I loved it!""",1324425600,4,1488,4.41970802919708
327255,5,6301272250,"To me, Intruder signals the end of an era of classic horror movies. From the early 1970's to this film in 1988, horror fans were treated to the most amazing gory shockers ever made in the Exploitation, Grindhouse, and golden age of Slasher cinema. After Intruder, the 90's ushered in tame bloodless films with bad digital effects which lasted until the dawn of the 21st century, and at present we seem to be back to violence,blood, and gore albeit not as original as it was in the 70s and 80s.

Intruder was also the film that the KNB effects crew used to jumpstart their careers as a single company and this film features some of their best gore effects, even now. Everything about this film, from the casting to the gore, and music score, screams classic slasher and one could initally think this film came out in 1981 along with The Burning and The Prowler.

However, Intruder delivers a dose of humor that seems to carry over from Evil Dead 2 and into this film. In a wierd way, I see this film as a companion piece to Evil Dead two. They share some of the same cast and most of the same crew. From Sam & Ted Raimi, to Bruce Campbell, the KNB guys and Scott Speigel, this film is an obvious labor of love for the genre carried out by friends with their hearts in the right place.

While the Wizard DVD release was uncut, this Blu Ray is an absolute must have. The new cover art, the vinatage 8 MM footage prior to the films creation, the additional gore sequences, and the new featurette with cast and crew interviews - All make this release an easy choice for slasher fans and fans of 1980's horror cinema. The new transfer of the film alone would warrant re-purchase because the film looks ten time better than it did on the Wizard release. I hope you like the color of blood, because this new transfer makes sure that every drop is literally popping out of your screen.

While there are still literally hundreds of films from the heydey of horror needing release on DVD (or even better, Blu Ray), Intruder is a much welcome addition to any horror fan's Blu Ray collection.",1324339200,6,2079,4.43455497382199
327256,4,6301272250,"Tom Becker, DVD Verdict --Intruder came along at the tail end of the '80s ""golden age"" of slashers, but you'd hardly know it. While it includes all the genre tropes (except gratuitous nudity, unfortunately), it presents them in a way that feels fresher and more creative than many of the countless other maniac-on-the-loose films that the decade produced.

While the basic plot--lunatic picking off young people in a confined space--and acting are nothing to write home about, writer/director Scott Spiegel and writer/producer Lawrence Bender keep their tongues planted firmly in their cheeks on this one without ever making Intruder one of those dreadfully self-conscious horror comedies. Of course, this isn't surprising when you consider that Spiegel was a long-time friend of Sam Raimi, the man behind The Evil Dead films (Spiegel shares writing credit on Evil Dead II; Sam's brother, Ted; and actor Bruce Campbell. The Raimis have significant roles in Intruder, playing a butcher and a produce guy, respectively, and Campbell turns up at the end for a brief bit as a cop.

The sensibility here: inventive and really gory kills, ironic dialogue, cleverly cynical ending, and a few unexpected treats. This includes the appearance of Tom Lester and Alvy Moore--that's Eb Dawson and Hank Kimball from Green Acres--as cops who turn up early in the film to check out a complaint about Craig. This bit works so well because it's not overplayed--there's no Green Acres theme music, no mannerisms or catch phrases that recall the previous characters; if you get it, you get it, if you don't...well, that's OK too, no one is spoon feeding you a cultural reference. We get a number of sight gags--some gruesome, some not--and some nicely drawn characters, including a stoner who tells a ridiculous and funny story about a blender.

As noted, the kills here are especially gruesome; Spiegel uses his supermarket like a kid in a candy store, with every all that dangerous stuff you'd normally find in a market--you know, butcher knives, meat hooks, things like that--getting extensive play. This was one of the first major jobs for the KNB Efx Group, and Robert Kurtzman, Gregory Nicotero, and Howard Berger turn up in the supplements to talk about this early break.

The film also doesn't skimp on suspense. The first kill doesn't actually take place until nearly 40 minutes in, but Spiegel uses that time to establish the characters and build suspense, with the night crew searching the store for the deranged Craig. Spiegel offers up some very creepy extended moments here, rare for a slasher of the time.

Then there's the ending, which might be an affront to scream queens everywhere, but does answer some questions I've always had about how police deal with scenes of outrageous carnage.

Synapse is having a banner year in Blu, with top-flight releases of titles like Vampire Circus, The Dorm that Dripped Blood, Frankenhooker, and The Exterminator. This company clearly respects consumer appreciation for these off-the-beaten-path films, offering not just a high-def bump, but meaningful supplements as well. This release of Intruder (Blu-ray) is no exception.

The 1080p transfer isn't exactly a marvel of technology, but it's better than decent. There's a fair amount of grain, and the picture is soft in spots, but colors are good, and contrast and clarity are, overall, excellent. The audio is a simple DTS-HD mono track, which is clean, clear, and perfectly serviceable.

The slate of extras is impressive.

Commentary: Siegel and Bender--who went on to produce for Quentin Tarantino--have a great time reminiscing; a fun listen, informative and entertaining.

""Slashed Prices: The Making of Intruder"": Most of the cast members get together for this 20-plus-year retrospective; again, a highly entertaining piece.

Extended Murder Sequences from the Original Workprint: More gore.

Outtakes from the now-lost short film, Night Crew: Intruder actually began its life as a short film Spiegel made when he was a teenager; that film--Night Crew--featured Sam Raimi in a leading role. It was shot in 8mm, and Spiegel gave his only copy to someone and never got it back, but here are some scenes he had laying around.

""The Slashing of Intruder"" with Filmmaker Vincent Pereira: Like me, Pereira rented this on VHS in the late '80s, only to discover that the wondrous gore scenes he'd seen stilled in Fangoria had been cut for the home release; Pereira wrote a letter of outrage to the magazine, a move that had a very cool ending.

In addition there's a Behind-the-Scenes Stills Gallery, Original Cast Audition Footage, a DVD copy, as well as trailers.

327257,5,6301272250,"I ordered mine from the Synapse Films website,for the work-print exclusive. Got it a whole month early. YAY!! This was a good blind buy for me, as I just discovered it when it was announced a month or two back. And when I saw it was made by Sam Raimi's old crew from Evil Dead, and Sam Raimi in a starring role, with a cameo by the Great Bruce Campbell, it was immediately an instant blind-buy.

A group of employees in a grocery store/supermarket works their final shift overnight,as the store is closing permanently. The main protagonist has a borderline ex-boyfriend obsessed with her. In a little while, people start dying in violent and graphic ways. The kills in this film are top-notch. Not all of them are creative, but the best ones, CAUTION:POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!,like an employee getting crushed by a trash compactor,and another getting his head sawed in half,are the stuff of a horror and gorehound fanatic's wildest dreams,or uhh,nightmares. The movie moves along at an adequate pace, the kills start shortly after the half-hour mark, and does not let up soon after. Both Sam and Ted Raimi of EVIL DEAD fame have roles, and Bruce Campbell makes a cameo at the end.

By the time this movie was made, the MPAA was already on their crusade against horror, esp. slasher movies, and were very strict, demanding severe cuts for so much as a few drops of red blood, at the risk of the old dreaded X-rating(now NC-17,same thing). And this movie was no exception. About 4-5 minutes were sliced out of this movie, rendering it neutered. It wasn't until many years later, that Wizard Video/Full Moon released this uncut in the U.S. on DVD, some more recent years back. I've never owned that, so I can't speak for the quality of that release.

Anyway, as always, Synapse Films has pulled out all the stops on this baby. The DTS-HD 2.0 Mono is clear, and about as sharp as any of the knives and gadgets in the flick. High volume is not needed to hear this well. The 1.78:1 Anamorphic picture is sprinkled with natural film grain throughout, but nothing that would deter enjoyment. In fact, it looks better than it probably ever has. Detail is accurate and on the mark, revealing a little more than seen before. Colors are vivid without being too bright or dark, just right. In other words, this may not be the best-looking blu-ray, but for a low-budget movie made in the 1980s, this is impressive. Very well done.

The extras are equally astounding. First, we got a fun audio commentary with writer/director Scott Spiegel and producer Lawrence Bender. It's not overly informative, but it's a good listen, as they recall their memories and enjoy and laugh with each other and the movie. They comment on little details in the movie, such as POV shots, how times have changed(price of cigarettes etc),filming etc. A good fun listen. Next, is a half-hour retrospective featurette, interviews with Bruce Campbell, Ted Raimi, Scott Spiegel, Lawrence Bender, Elizabeth Cox, Danny Hicks and some others. Sam Raimi,is sadly,MIA. Some cool behind the scenes photos in between. The Outtakes from the lost short-film, Night Crew are def. worth a look. Then there's a brief interview with filmmaker and fan Vincent Pereira, it's brief but informative chat about how he discovered the movie through GOREZINE mag, and was let down by the censorship. And cast audition footage, worth a look.

Now the work-print footage comes from the bonus work-print DVD-R that I got with this set. Some slightly extended kills, that is very interesting and some other scenes and dialogue not in the final director's cut. The work-print version as a whole is very much worth a watch, as some other scenes and dialogue bits cannot be discovered in any other version. But for those who didn't get the bonus disc, the extended work-print kills are on on the BD and DVD as an extra.

Another slam-dunk release from Synapse. They are on a roll, and I hope they keep up the great work. Recommended to all horror/slasher/gorehound and Sam Raimi/Bruce Campbell fans. Cheers!",1321142400,44,4033,4.812409812409812
327258,2,6301272250,"When I saw some of the names involved here, Bruce Campbell, Sam and Ted Raimi, I figured this would be good, campy fun. Campy it was. Fun it wasn't.

Here's the scoop. Just before closing one night at a super market, one of the cashiers, Jennifer Ross, is approached by an ex boyfriend, just out of prison on a murder rap, who is determined to win her back. She's not thrilled with the idea and later finds out, along with the rest of her co-workers, that it's their last night at the store. The two owners have sold to the city and are cashing out. Suddenly, the bodies of said co-workers begin to pile up and we know who the prime suspect is.

This was just a lousy movie. None of the characters were particularly well developed and when they started to get offed it was difficult to care much. The kills themselves weren't all that clever. It was all just so ponderous and leaden. Then comes the big surprise. It happens early in the third act with over 20 minutes of running time left. The script was nowhere near clever enough to hold out that long. I wasn't certain I could hold out that long.

It sucked on a technical level as well. It was shot and lit poorly. Some of the camera tricks might have seemed clever back then but they haven't withstood the test of time. Even the wardrobe was bad. They put the heroine, Jennifer, in one of the most unflattering outfits ever. And what about Bruce Campbell. He shows up in the final scene and does a fine job with the 3 or 4 lines given him.

I'm sorry, but I go into a movie wanting to like it. No one wants to feel they've wasted their time but that's exactly how I felt here. About the only cool thing happening was when Alvy Moore and Tom Lester, of ""Green Acres"" fame, show up as a couple of hapless cops. Other than that I'd let this stinker pass by.",1320710400,2,1809,4.25

It did already have a Domestic release as well that ran 88 minutes (so I'm guessing the first printing was uncut as well...). Again, this is a good film for the slasher genre and highly recommended as they come few and far between with the quality spookiness and rather original storyline that this film delivers. I'm sure you can get the 1st printing right here but your choice is DVD only. I would definitely say get a cheap, excellent condition first printing unless BR is the only way you can go and the bonus features.

327260,4,6301272250,"The first time I saw Intruder was via a good friend of mine who through his work as a publicist obtained an advance VHS copy of this film. I remember thinking it was weak story wise, but intense gore effects wise. Well, 20 some odd years later, I finally watched this DVD re-release and was very very impressed. Yes, the story may seem a bit insipid and trite, almost as if the story were really the supporting character to the starring role which was the incredible gore SFX by KNB -- THE masters of special effects. But, this time around, I could actually SEE the film, whereas the original VHS quality was so poor half of it was washed out and completely hidden in unintentional shadows. The story was actually quite good for what it was. This is a slasher film, and as one of the last true films of that noble genre, it succeeds wonderfully. The killer is as ruthless as slashers can get, blindly sadistic and with absolutely no remorse. Also, I was genuinely surprised by who the killer turned out to be. The familiar faces of Sam and Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell (in his best role since Evil Dead 2, yes, partly cuz it's so short), and Dan Hicks, who played one of the shemps in Evil Dead 2, they were all great to see acting together in this film. I also give Scot Spiegel TONS of credit for daring to film this audaciously violent film when other filmmakers were succumbing to the mighty thumb of the MPAA and the current anti-violent film campaign that permeated America in the latter part of the 1980's. I highly recommend this film to slasher fans and to those who have only heard the rumors of what a groundbreaking film Intruder really was.",1302652800,,1650,4.466887417218543
327261,4,6301272250,"Intruder is a slasher film directed by Scott Spiegel, who as horror fans know, is a buddy and writing partner of Sam Raimi.
The slasher carnage takes place after hours in a grocery store as the night crew work.  Early on in the film, the crazy ex-boyfriend of our heroine shows up and causes a big scene.  He's kicked out of the store but continues to lurk about and make phone calls.  Soon, folks start getting bumped off.  All suspicions are on Craig, the crazy ex boyfriend, but we all pretty much know he's not the killer because such great lengths are taken to make it look like he is.
The killings don't begin until quite a while into the film.  Usually in slasher films the killings are sprinkled throughout the film, but here they all happen in about a ten minute chunk.  Be that as it may, I really didn't find the movie to be boring or to drag, even though for stretches it didn't seem like alot was going on.
Some of the kills are rather impressive, and as you can imagine, this whole film is done rather tongue in cheek rather than in an effort to scare the pants off you.  Spiegel obviously learned all he knows from Raimi as he pretty much directs in the same style-Not totally, but awfully close.  Lots of zany camerawork and goofy POV shots all around.
As you may already know, Raimi himself plays a small role as the store butcher, and Bruce Campbell shows up for less than a minute of actual screen time as a police officer.  Slapping Campbell's name boldly on the DVD box cover is kind of a low blow considering we're only talking about a cameo here.

Fellow gore hounds have nothing to worry about; all the slicing and dicing is here for your enjoyment. I have quite a few films from Full Moon/Wizard Entertainment and this is by far the best video and audio presentation I've seen from them. While the picture and sound may not be perfect by today's standards, it's about the best legitimate version we'll get until a major studio decides to re-release it.

The full screen print used by Wizard Entertainment is pretty decent containing some very minor blemishes here and there. Picture quality is really better than anything I expected from them and for the most part it's really clear. I didn't hear any problems with the sound, the blood curdling screams came across nice and clear on my sound system. My only real complaint with this DVD is the lack of special features/bonus content that Full Moon is famous for including in their DVD releases.

Welcome to the Walnut Lake Market where everything is being slashed and I mean everything!  Filmed on a very modest budget of around $100,000 dollars comes the seldom seen and highly underrated 80's slasher, ""Intruder"" directed by Scott Spiegel. This little gore fest is widely considered to be a cult classic amongst fans of the horror/slasher genre and thanks to Full Moon/Wizard Entertainment it's finally available on DVD in all its uncut glory. Make no mistake this is the unrated Directors cut and the killings are definitely carried out in brutal and gruesome fashion.

Its closing time at the local Walnut Lake Market and a confrontation takes place at the check out counter between Jennifer the cashier and her just out of prison ex-boyfriend Craig Peterson. It seems that Craig still loves Jennifer even though she wants nothing to do with him. After an altercation with the other employees Craig hides out in the store until he can confront Jennifer once again. It's not long after Craig is thrown out of the store that the bodies begin to pile up. Is Jennifer's ex-boyfriend the killer?  Who else besides Craig Peterson would want to kill Jennifer and her co-workers? You'll have to buy your own copy to find out what happens.

The brief cameo of Emil Sitka as Mr. Abernathy at the beginning of the movie was priceless. Fans will recognize Mr. Sitka from the three stooges shorts and his lines were hilarious. I enjoyed seeing ""Intruder"" again and I think that Scott Spiegel absolutely made the most of what he was given to work with in terms of budget, talent and special effects. I think the camera angles as well as the editing was very well done and the end result was a solid 80's slasher flick. The ending of this movie, never gets old. I'd love to see a remake of this movie.

327285,4,6301272250,"Intruder was a great horror film, a very good find. I saw the trailer for the movie and it does give away the real villian but oh my is it worth checking out for the death scenes. Anyways, here's a quick snyposis of the movie

A local grocery store is near closing time when an ex boyfriend of the cashier shows up and wants her back. He fights with ever male worker in the store but finally leaves. We then learn the store is being sold to the town and everyone is bummed. Strange things start to go down and the killings begin. Like I said earlier, the death scenes are friggin outstanding. The one with bandsaw was one of the greatest death scenes in horror movie history. The killer was good even though the trailer kind of gave it away. The ending was a twist and I thought it was a refreshing for a horror movie.

Overall, I cannot recommend this film enough. It had a great story, great death scenes, and the ending was satisfying. Must watch.",1280188800,,950,4.301675977653631
327286,4,6301272250,"INTRUDER is a fantastic and undermentioned Slasher that came right at the end of the first era in the late 80s. Director Scott Spiegel took all the right notes from friend Sam Raimi when making this micro-budget film, and takes advantage of a wide variety of interesting camera angles and superior lighting techniques to turn a small, cramped grocery store into a looming and foreboding death trap. What I appreciate most about this one is how natural each of the characters are. This may be the first cast in film history that looks like the average assembly of home town teens: they dress plainly, their facial features and acne scares aren't hidden under mounds of make-up, they are not unnaturally attractive, they are just everyday people that you can actually see working at the neighborhood market. While the acting isn't great, it also isn't scripted, and it gives the flick an amateur charm that lends even more credibility to the characters. The film also generates genuine suspense through perfectly timed edits, clever camera set-ups, and creative framing. If that wasn't enough, the gore and deaths in INTRUDER rank among the best in the genre. There are some really fantastic FX here done by the one and only KNB, including a face crushing in a trash compactor, a face that is sawed in half, geysers of blood streaming from stab wounds, a meat hook through the face, and that's just the start!! One of the biggest flaws with the film would have to be that the killer is hardly concealed and easily recognizable, but outside of that the numerous attempts to recapture the same visual style of EVIL DEAD get a little tired when they are overused. But hey, if that's the worst the film has to offer, I'll take it. This is a must-see for any gore fan, but for such a simple plot, it is smart, sleek, and scary little Slasher that comes highly recommended!

327288,4,6301272250,"Everyone knows grocery store checkouts cost an arm and a leg. In this grocery store it literally costs you an arm and a leg.  Intruder was filmed in 1989 and released a few years ago on DVD. I came across this film in Blockbuster and it looked interesting so I gave it a try. Glad I did.  It's fun, and funny and very very gory.  The movie is the usual-set up some characters, toss around a few red herrings, then have them slaughtered by an unknown killer. The identity of the real killer is obvious to anyone who pays attention to the characters in the store. One of them disappears from sight and since we don't see this person killed-well there you go.  To add to the short list of suspects is the ex-con boyfriend of one of the stores checkout cashiers.

The movie is not even a great slasher film-you know a hanging meat hook in the stores meat locker will soon have a shelf stocking clerk hanging from it-an eyeball in a olive jar, a severed arm in the lobster tank, a head split horizontally by a meat slicing machine, a human head hand puppet and there is a kill scene that looks eerily realistic.  A young man is stabbed in the stomach with a large bone-cutting knife and instead of a quick cut to another scene..well it's hard to describe but it's the look of resignation on the young mans face about what is happening to him that makes this scene a little unusual.

Intruder is not intended for anyone expecting art but in it's own cheesy way it's a lot of good bloody fun.

Remember--the next time you are in a grocery aisle and you see some, red goo on the floor, it might be possible that it's not some spilled strawberry jam. And yes Jason, this movie has a lot of places to have a good laugh at.",1247875200,2,1712,4.2786377708978325
327289,5,6301272250,"Talk about working the graveyard shift down at the old meat market - and I do mean meat market.  Prices aren't the only things being slashed at the Walnut Lake Market tonight.  Cleanup on aisle 5 - and 7 - and 10 - and, oh hell, the whole darn place is a bloodbath.  (Sorry - I thought it would be best if I went ahead and got some of those corny clich&eacute;d lines out of my system right here at the start.)  You know, there's nothing like a low-budget horror movie that really steps up and delivers the goods - it doesn't happen often, but it definitely happened back in 1989 with the release of Intruder.  If you thought The Mist was the first ""panic in a supermarket"" film ever made, you're really missing out.  Intruders, even the edited version (a pox on censors and the studios that give in to them), is a gory classic.  Just look at what you get here: lots of blood and gore delivered by some pretty interesting murder implements, a bit of a mystery as to who the killer really is (even though I had no trouble discerning early on just how it would all play out), a fairly hot heroine (Elizabeth Cox) sporting a classic 80s hairstyle, not one but two Raimis among the cast, and even a very funny (albeit borrowed) decapitation story.  You'll notice I left the Bruce Campbell cameo out of this list - it's so short and pedestrian that it really isn't worth mentioning (except to point out how disingenuous it is of the studio to market the film as a Bruce Campbell vehicle) - heck, I didn't even notice The Chinned One my first time through.

It's almost closing time at the market when Craig Peterson (David Byrnes - not to be confusing with Talking Heads front man and all-around musical genius David Byrne) shows up wanting to talk to his old girlfriend Jennifer (Elizabeth Cox).  He's already miffed over the fact that she never even wrote to him during his recent stay in prison, so it's no surprise that her face-to-face rejection of him results in him causing quite a fracas.  Being the super-macho man that he is, Craigie runs off and hides somewhere inside the store.  The night doesn't get much better after the night crew finally tracks Craig down and throws him out, as that's when co-owners Danny (Eugene R. Glazer) and Bill (Dan Hicks) announce that they are selling the store.  Now, as if their normal post-closing duties aren't enough, the crew also has to start marking down all of the prices in lieu of their impending unemployment.  They needn't have bothered working too hard, though, because the vast majority of them are about to be picked off one by one by a bloodthirsty killer.  It's almost too easy for the murdering fiend; with everyone spread out all over the store, no one realizes what is going on until it's too late, and the killer has all sorts of implements of death at his disposal - meat hooks, butchers' knives, hydraulic garbage disposals, meat slicers, etc.  The special effects aren't always that realistic, but there's plenty of blood and gore for the viewer to enjoy (especially if you have the uncut version of the film).  When you get five whole minutes of your bloodiest work edited out by the despicable censers, you know you've done something right.

Some may not care for first-time director Scott Speigel's Raimi-inspired use of wacky camera angles here and there, but you have to admire his success at creating a slasher film uniquely his own - Intruder is in no way a by-the-numbers slasher.  Having worked with Sam Raimi as well as Bruce Campbell (both of whom he had known since high school) on the first two Evil Dead films, Speigel knew what he was doing in the director's chair, and it couldn't have hurt to have Sam Raimi right there on hand as one of the actors.  Inserting humor into a slasher is always an iffy proposition, but Spiegel gets it pretty close to right here.  I would also have to give him my vote for most creative use of a decapitated head in a movie (which really should be an Oscar category, if you ask me).

Even if you figure out what is really going on inside this ill-fated supermarket long before the end credits begin to roll, the conclusion still satisfies with a nice little final twist.  That is one of many reasons why Intruder is a true classic of the genre.",1209168000,4,4255,4.526109660574413
327290,3,6301272250,"Intruder is a corny slasher flick, but it's also very enjoyable if these are the kinds of movies that you gravitate to.  I personally love horror movies from this period.

A disgruntled ex-boyfriend and his not-interested-anymore-exgirlfriend create some odd tension before the mayhem begins.  Good death scenes with ample gore.  Also, a nice twist at the end.

327292,4,6301272250,"Want to hear a funny story about my experience with Scott Spiegel's 1989 slasher ""Intruder""? Wait! Where are you going? Come back! I promise my tale doesn't involve a slideshow in which you'll see me lounging on a beach wearing a microkini. Good. Now sit down and shut up. Anyway, I put off seeing ""Intruder"" for some time because I knew from my various investigations across the Internet that two versions of the film on DVD were floating around. One is the notorious unrated version, the one with all the gory carnage intact. The other is a cut edition that, obviously, leaves out the aforementioned blood and guts. Bummer. For the life of me I cannot understand why, in this day and age, a company would release a cut to ribbons version of a horror film. Maybe the people in charge of distributing this sleazy little classic thought that video stores wouldn't carry the unrated edition. Wrong. Even a certain well-known brick and mortar shop prominently displays unedited cuts of controversial films these days. The one near me didn't carry ""Intruder"" in any form, unfortunately. I had to rent online, and that service only listed the R-rated cut. For some mysterious reason they sent me the unrated version instead. Yay!

See, wasn't that a funny story? Har Har Har! Yeah. So back to Spiegel's ""Intruder"". You've read about it, talked about it with friends, and now you're ready to sit down and finally see it. The film is pretty much everything you've heard about from others. Gory, poorly acted, gory, shot on the cheap, gory, inventive camera angles, gory--yep, it's a fun film. Set in a grocery store late at night, ""Intruder"" tells the story of Jennifer (Elizabeth Cox), a night cashier with a big problem. Her criminal boyfriend Craig (David Byrnes) just got out of jail and desperately wants to see his former squeeze. She wants nothing to do with him, of course, leading to a tense scene in which a fight breaks out between Craig and the store's staff. Speaking of the staff, we've got Jennifer's pal Linda (Renee Estevez), Randy (Sam Raimi), and ""Produce"" Joe (Ted Raimi). The owner of the store, Danny (Eugene Glazer), and his co-owner Bill (Dan Hicks) round out the cast. Unless you count the two second cameo by Bruce Campbell as one of the cops looking for the wayward Craig. It's a lot of people to keep track of, but the large cast also means plenty of cannon fodder for the killer.

After the fight with Craig, Danny and Bill announce to the staff that they've decided to sell the store. Lots of complaining from the staff ensues before everyone grudgingly goes back to the grind. Linda chats with the frazzled Jennifer before leaving for the night. Too bad for her considering what happens out in the parking lot. Thus begins the bloodshed, and what a glorious bloodshed it is! What will you see in the uncut version of ""Intruder""? How does a butcher knife in the head, a head slowly crushed in a compactor, and a meat hook through the throat grab you? You'll see all of that plus the infamous band saw atrocity so many other reviewers talk about with such relish. Even better, the gore effects look convincing. They ought to since the camera lingers with tender loving care on each act of bloody brutality. Just when you think the movie doesn't have anything else to offer, sit back and prepare yourself for a few twists and turns before we learn the identity of the killer. I would say that ""Intruder"" is almost gialloish in its use of myriad red herrings concerning the murderer rampaging through the store.

About the only drawback I saw while watching the movie concerns the pacing. Almost nothing of real interest happens in the first half of the movie. Wait, scratch that: I guess that's not true if you want to learn the ends and outs of working the night shift at the local grocery store, but you have to wait forever if you're tuning in to see the gore. The killings start happening like clockwork about forty or fifty minutes in, so it's a pretty long wait by movie standards. Even ""Friday the 13th"" tried to spread the killings out better than that. Oh well. ""Intruder"" boasts far more positives than negatives. The former includes, but is not limited to, the gore, the hot girl playing the lead, her late 1980s haircut (which really looks good on her), the kooky cast, and the atmospheric setting. There's nothing creepier than a big, nearly abandoned building late at night. It's the perfect environment in which a spree killer can perform his or her bloody work without having to worry about detection. A pox upon the MPAA for demanding heavy cuts back in the 1980s. A further pox upon Paramount for caving in to the MPAA. Then again, these are the same nervous nellies that still refuse to give us uncut versions of the various ""Friday the 13th"" films.

""Intruder"" gets four stars from me. It's a fun film that will go down very easy with the slasher fan crowd. Too bad the DVD release doesn't contain much in the way of extras. We get a trailer for the film and a few other trailers for other flicks thrown in for good measure. No commentary track or cast and crew interviews. Disappointing in the extreme. A few other additions in the supplements department surely would have sent the fanboys into a tizzy, but it doesn't really matter. Spiegel's fun little slasher is entertaining enough without glitzy extras. Definitely worth a watch if you like horror movies. If you worship the slasher genre, the uncut version of ""Intruder"" is a must own.",1178323200,,5483,4.678756476683938
