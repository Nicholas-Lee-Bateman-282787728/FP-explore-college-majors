8097620,2,B000CCW2MA,"This work is divided into 5 parts. The first 4 appear to have been produced around 1990. Their production is a bit corny. But, the facts that they present appear to be accurate and their presentation is only mildly biased. The fourth part contains a segment about ""environmental terrorism,"" which seems a bit biased. The fifth part on the third CD is very recent, very biased, and corny. It covers 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. I skimmed through it and at the end, it says, ""Enduring Freedom Productions."" I got this video through my library, but if I had purchased it, I would be pretty upset. To summarize, this video isn't worth purchasing due to the unprofessional and out-of-date production.",1189123200,2,709,4.772357723577236
8097621,1,B000CCW2MA,"I chose this product based on the experience I have had with Amazon.  I reviewed this set for possible inclusion in classroom training I conduct.  The material is outdated and biased.  I got a history lesson when I was expecting a timely presentation of the topic of terorism.  It wouldn't be so bad as far as history lessons go, but the lessons were outdated.  I am very dissapointed.",1142640000,8,385,4.602941176470588
8097622,1,B000CCW2MA,"This video contains out-dated material and clear propaganda especially as it relates to environmental matters.  I don't know who ""Enduring Freedom Productions"" is but they should be ashamed of themselves for packaging old material with ""new topics"" which amount to no more than half baked rehashed news reports.  Enduring Freedom, lose the theme song and be assured, you fooled me once; it won't happen again.",1140739200,10,409,5.276923076923077
