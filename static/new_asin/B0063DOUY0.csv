4936144,3,B0063DOUY0,"The documentary was fairly straightforward. Nothing of note. The rush to get it out so close to the passing of Steve Jobs is reflected in the quality of the film. One comment: Wikileaker may have had some valid points but unfortunately we need to completely disqualify everything in his/her comment due to argumentum ad hitlerum. Sorry, Wikileaker. You crossed the line into absurdity. You may want to read some history before invoking the atrocities of the Nazis before comparing them to a successful marketer.",1321660800,,511,5.095238095238095

4936148,1,B0063DOUY0,"Caught the Jobs documentary during its original air date the first week of November 2011 here on WHRO-15 (Norfolk, Virginia). Also caught the re-broadcasts on World 15-2 and took copious notes. So glad to be the first reviewer here.

Okay, here we go. We all have surely by now (5 weeks following his death) heard the Jobs story and the ""conventional"" wisdom that goes with it -- genius, innovator, revolutionary, hero, blah blah blah. Now here comes some truth boys and girls.

Jobs did not invent ANYTHING. He did not innovate ANYTHING of material worth. He took inventions created by others and successfully marketed them to a greater degree than any single one of his competitors. In other words, he built a brand in the commercial marketplace, Apple. Okay, that's not nothing I'll agree. But it in no way makes him the consumer electronics polymath that he's been built up to be.

Let's get down to FACTs. The documentary states that the Apple I was ""the first personal computer that used a keyboard and a screen"". Actually, the Apple I was NOT a ""personal computer"", it was in fact a KIT from which an electronics hobbyist could assemble into a computer. This is not the same thing, folks! If you want the truth, the first real personal computer with a keyboard and screen was either the Commodore PET or the Radio Shack TRS-80, depending on exactly how one defines what a ""computer"" is. Chuck Peddle exhibited the first PET at the first West Coast Computer Fair on April 16-17 1977. It is not certain when the consumer could actually acquire a working PET, however. The Radio Shack TRS-80 was first exhibited on August 3 1977 and was first delivered to customers in November 1977 -- and was available throughout the USA in over 3000+ Radio Shack retail stores. My vote is for the TRS-80. But it most definitely it was not the Apple I as stated in the film. As for the Apple 2, well, it may have been available via mail order earlier (a bit), but certainly not through any local dealers during 1977.

So I hear that Jobs' Macintosh invented the Graphical User Interface (GUI). I guess nobody remembers Apple's own Lisa, which preceded it by at least a year. Or that the GUI was actually invented at Xerox PARC, and Jobs/Apple ""borrowed"" it? The film states that a ""deal"" was struck between Apple and Xerox for it, but from what I see on Wikipedia in this regard, it certainly was not any sort of ""formal"" documented deal, such as a licensing agreement. At any rate, if there was some ""deal"" as stated in the film, then why did Xerox file a lawsuit against Apple on Apple's use of Xerox's GUI technology (when Apple sued Microsoft over the Windows GUI) ?

Jobs ""invented"" the iPod alright, but the portable digital music player AKA MP3 player already existed as a consumer product on the market --check it out. Jobs ""invented"" the iPhone alright, but let's recall that there did in fact exist on the market for years already handheld cellular phones with computer ""apps"" and touchscreens built in. Only then they were called Palm Pilots -- anybody remember that? Even had handwriting recognition (Graffiti), something the ""modern"" handhelds gave up. Jobs ""invented"" the iPad alright, but did we not have tablet computers already? Take a wild guess.

We can see a pattern emerging here. It seems the key to market success is to take someone else's idea(s), dumb them down (er, excuse me, I meant ""simplify""), hitch them to an existing brand name (Apple), give it slim and sleek lines and pretty colors, and serve up some slick groovy advertising. Oh, and hit the customer with a premium price in order to give the product an aura of coolness and exclusivity. Repeat ad nauseum.

I saw a full-page article in the newspaper last week listing the patents that Jobs was awarded throughout his career. All had to do with the ""look and feel"" of the products, their external appearances. Not one single patent had to do with technological improvement.

What of advancing the state of the technology? What about expanding the range of usefulness rather than mere user-friendliness? Which, BTW, was attained only by dumbing down the usefulness. Jobs contributed not one single iota of new technology. All he did was dumb it down so the average idiot could access it, and make it look pretty. Is this all we have come to demand from our technology?

So what are we to make of the Jobs mythology? I am reminded of Adolph Hitler's propaganda minister Goebbels, who said that a lie, if repeated often enough and loudly enough, becomes the truth. This is what's happened with the Jobs legend.

Here's my last thing: about Jobs being superior to Edison as an inventor (""Edison only had three"" (inventions that changed the world)). Anyone ever hear of the electric light bulb??? Not mentioned in this mockumentary. What would any reasonable person say about how THAT changed the way people lived vis-a-vis whatever Jobs may have quote-unquote ""invented"".",1320451200,49,4942,4.76285046728972

The documentary was advertised to provide something significant about Steve Jobs after he passed away. But unfortunately,it didn't. It was basically a rehash of many information that has already been known especially those who are familiar with him like Apple Computer enthusiasts among others. But nevertheless,it was a fair and remarkable portrayal of the man who have definitely made an impact in all four namely:the computer industry,the music industry,the movie industry and the phone industry. Aside from that,people will get to appreciate a view of the man from the good,the bad,the ugly and the insanely great from people interviewed who have interacted with him.

I would have preferred to hear more from those who knew Steve as a young man rather than in his later years, but in the effort to keep this within the average American attention span, I applaud this documentary.

Less insightful than the book, people will be served well whom can't sit and read a 600 page essay on a dead computer geek, whom smelled odd and was an ass to more people than he should have been.
  However, the world loss an innovator like few others (Edison,Westinghouse,Franklin) and may see more of thanks to the tools he helped create. He was a very complex individual whom on paper should have amounted to a janitor, and yet he helped bring to life products that stunned and moved the world.

Yes, I understood that he was this 'geek' that had created these 'awesome' gadgets, but what I failed to understand was why the world came to an abrupt halt when his death was announced.

Watching this documentary, left me with no question in my mind that this man was truly a creative genius that took the technological world to a whole new level. A level, truly of his own.

What I saw was sort of embarrassing, and I know that Steve Jobs would find it a poor attempt at trying to tell his life story. I got that idea when I saw the poor green screening, and the presence of Will.i.am in the teaser at the beginning, I was probably gonna be seeing something that wasn't THAT good.

The interviews feel sort of contrived, and it all feels too soon to find all of these people who knew Jobs.

This movie is good for general public or for the newer generation who does not know too much about Steve. However, I feel this film is too simple and does miss a lot of topics. It will be great to dig in more and talk about Steve's complex personality, especially his 'Reality distortion'. Steve is very smart person. However, he is crazy as well and sometimes time acts like a jerk. He does treat people bad and use them when he needs them. The film makes Steve and Bill Gate looks like friend. However, if you read Walter's book, Steve still talks about nasty thing about Bill. Don't get me wrong. I love Steve. I just wish this film can be more objective. So, audience has the full view of Steve as a person. The world does evolve and change for better because of Steve's idea. He pushes his team to the limit in order to make things world. He wants his team to work only with A players. He once layoff most Lisa's team because he said the Lisa's team is consists of B players..and does not fit in to Apple's culture. This can be seen as mean. On the other hand, however, he brings Discipline to Apple's culture. He is a master in reading and using people. He walks with you like a best friend (if he needs you).

Despite all of this, few know much about the ""real Steve Jobs"", underneath all the hype the surrounded him and Apple.

If you want to watch laudatory snippets praising the creativity and amazingness of Steve Jobs, without any real depth in the film, this is it. I don't think I learned anything here, and to be honest, I feel a little grossed out by how gushy in adulation the film was. I expected better from PBS.",1342915200,4,605,4.315789473684211

This so-called documentary provides absolutely no insight to the man who changed the world. The film shows snippets of random things about Steve Jobs that tells absolutely nothing about him or his history. It doesn't talk about his childhood, his upbringing, his education, or what he actually did at NeXT, Pixar, and Apple. The so-called interviews are nothing but people who say ""yeah, he was a great guy."" Steve jobs was more than a man who revolutionized the computing, animation, phone, music, and tablet industries. He was a spectacular character with a unique personality in his own right.

""Steve Jobs: One Last Thing"" is merely a film that was made to cash-in on his recent death. Read Walter Isaacson's autobiography to truly get a glimpse of the man.",1332028800,,849,4.855172413793103

4936456,3,B0063DOUY0,"Steve Jobs was a marketing/PR genius, and the fact that so many people believe he was more than that is testament to his talent. Despite the fact that his main contributions to man-kind are a few well-designed consumer electronic items, there's a wide perception that Apple represents something greater - that the company is actually ""doing good in the world"" in some broader sense. What makes this particularly remarkable is the fact that Apple is notoriously one of the *least* charitable corporations. But Jobs is a genius at making people buy into a brand itself, rather than just the products themselves.

Many people also mistakenly attribute earlier Apple products, like the Apple II series, to Jobs; while he certainly had a part, Steve Wozniak was the technical ""brains"" of Apple at the time.

While Steve Jobs undoubtedly had a big impact on the way people interact with technology, it bothers me to see so much praise for a man whose contributions are more or less frivolous. It's not like he invented the smart phone; Apple products mostly just influence the way middle class people in rich countries socialize. There are countless people who make contributions that help millions, shift technological paradigms, or add to our understanding of the universe. The fact that Jobs has managed to stand out, despite the nature of his contributions, shows what a master he was at marketing the Apple brand.",1331683200,7,1412,5.004255319148936

Jonathan Ive is responsible for much of Apple's success since 1997, and was thought by some to be Jobs' successor at Apple. His contributions include the design the first iMac, and later for the huge iPod line, MacBook, iPhone, iPad, the beautiful titanium PowerMac G5, basically every piece of hardware Apple has released in the past 12 years.

It's just a shortened version of existing, longer films about the history of Steve Jobs. The subtitle ""One Last Thing"" seemed to suggest that the film might actually have more detail or insight about Jobs or his inventions than other films might. I looked forward to learning more about his journey in Buddhism or his supposed future plans for developing technologies that will impact the television industry. Either of those would have been fitting as ""one last thing,"" but this film instead is sadly just a rehash of old information.

What the film does have is good narration and sequencing. It is easy to follow along with and explains the Jobs story visually with appropriate detail. Its use of first-person interviews with some of Jobs's old acquaintances is one of the few highlights. The film could have been much improved had the interviews been allowed to take a more prominent role. I would have liked to have heard more from the Buddhist colleague or perhaps even Jobs's wife, who did not actually appear in the film.

Despite the many ways the film could be improved, it is still worth watching if you are a staunch Steve Jobs or Apple product fan. If you are looking for something more substantive, consider reading one of the Steve Jobs biographies instead.",1327881600,13,1539,5.329218106995885

The interview with both Jobs and Gates conceding to eachother's contributions to the industry was inspirational. Additional footage including Ross Perot as an investor for Apple, Next, Pixar was very interesting.

While watching it, I cried yet again for the loss of a man who had such tremendous genius and the ability to impact all of our lives.

4936587,4,B0063DOUY0,"As was pointed out by a few other reviewers of this show - that aired on PBS and is being released on DVD (with no bonus features) - you can't cover a career as large as Jobs in just an hour. The major networks did ""tributes"" to Jobs but this 56-minute show attempts to cover his full career from his first meeting with Steve Wozniak (the classmate who introduced the two Steves is interviewed) until his last public appearance. The story is told with interview with a selected few people who knew him well - nearly all newspersons. The one who stands out from the pack is Walter Mossberg, the technology columnist for the Wall Street Journal. Mossberg is one of my favorite technology reporters, though this is the first time I've heard me ""speak"". I'm even more impressed now.

I learned a few things about Jobs that I didn't know - though not much. This DVD will really stand among those hour-long shows that the Biography Channel airs and then find their way to school and public libraries.

At least one other reviewer went on about the fact that one of the ""talking heads"" in this program said that Jobs was as important as Thomas Edison as an inventor. I've spent the last 40 years studying Edison and I don't see any real comparison. Edison invented a few things in his early years but he was best known for improving things. He did not INVENT the Electric Light but he IMPROVED IT ( so it would last longer and be safer). He did not INVENT the motion picture camera. The French Lumiere brothers did. But he improved it and made it more commercial. And he did this with his TEAM, not alone. He designed the phonograph (at the exact same time as Frenchman Charles Cros - working independently in France) but he had his engineer John Krusi make it. Jobs had visions and ideas and saw a way to have his products make money. He really wasn't an inventor.

So, I disagree with the Edison comparison at the end of the program but, otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think many others will too!
