8118448,5,B000F77VWI,"Kim Su Ah is a butt kicking undercover detective.  From the beginning to the end she kicks the bad guys asses.  The asses of both the criminals and the school bullies.  Being a former school bully and gang leader, she does an excellent job at this.  Assigned to protect a criminal gang leaders daughter while he is waiting to testify against his former cronies turns into a daunting task for her.  She has to deal with high school bullies, crazy teachers, even crazier police colleagues while dealing with an insane and murderous gangster.  It's all a lot of fun!

On top of all that, she is attracted to a mysterious high school student played by Gang Woo (Coffee Prince, Finding Mr. Destiny, Big).  I wish they woulld have revealed more of his background or did a sequel starring him.  I would have watched it!

I wasn't sure what I would get when I ordered this movie, but I'm glad that I did.  I originally based my purchase solely on Gang Woo and Kim Su Ah being in the movie, but I got way more than I expected and am very happy with the purchase.  The subtitles are very well done also.",1407888000,2,1093,4.383084577114428

8118450,5,B000F77VWI,"This is one fun movie. Park Kwang-chun makes the movie entertaining. Her facial expressions are varied and contributes to the movie. There should be more movies like this. Enjoyable.

8118451,4,B000F77VWI,"I really loved watching this movie. The only reason I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it wrapped up in the last third of the movie way too fast. Things started happening, and I knew why, but I felt like I had missed a scene somewhere getting me from point A to point C.

Kim Sun Ah plays, Jane who is an undercover cop. Her current assignment is to go undercover as a high schooler to get close to the daughter of their actual target. Apparently Jane wasn't very good in High School the first time around, and doesn't do much better the second time. She was actually a bit of a thug.

To complicate things, she is next door to someone else who is new to the school-- and rather attractive. In Hyun (I think that was his character's name) played by Gong Yoo also appears to be a great fighter and is going out of his way to be suave in front of the target's daughter.

Gong Yoo and Kim Sun Ah's chemistry is fantastic. Plus, you can really tell that both of them just enjoy acting with each other. They are some of the best actors I have come across in Kdrama Land. (He in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-1st-Shop-of-Coffee-Prince/dp/B0011Z1T4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 1st Shop of Coffee Prince</a>.. and Big, though that show was a bust for me. And she in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Lovely-Sam-Soon/dp/B000BLAK76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Lovely Sam-Soon</a>&nbsp;and I Do, I Do.)  The side characters are fun, not too cartoonish (as I've often seen in Kdramas) they are mostly pretty three dimensional. The plot is pretty quickly paced, which works well with all of the action that is on screen. I'd never seen either actor in an action role, so it was fun watching this.

There are some weirdly gory scenes with the bad guy of the movie. The rest of it has a lot of humor to it, even with the action. I'd totally love to see the two of them in a film again. (Plus the ending leaves just enough mystery.)

It also has the added bonus of one of the craziest action scene music scores that I have heard. It is a sped up version of the hymn, Simple Gifts/Lord of the Dance. Which is one of my favorite hymns, so I got really excited when ever it started, but it was a bit strange for what was happening on screen.",1351036800,6,2333,4.762376237623762
