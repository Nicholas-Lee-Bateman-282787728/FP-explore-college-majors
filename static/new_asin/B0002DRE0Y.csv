2080575,5,B0002DRE0Y,"This is an excellent set even though it is in the form of a ""best of"" collection rather than a complete season. That said, and being my only gripe about the release, this set is very intriguing, being able to watch 26 very bizarre re-counts of UFO sightings, abductions, and so forth. I have watched a good portion of the UFO boxed set and must say that while some stories keep me guessing between hoax or reality, there are several, such as the Phoenix Sightings that really give me chills down my spine. When one specific UFO sighting is documented by many different people, it becomes clear that a hoax is not possible. It is things like that in which I am looking for. I don't care about the special features or episode order, just fantastic and chilling episodes from an excellent series.",1094947200,10,793,4.5524475524475525
2080576,4,B0002DRE0Y,"This is the first of several 'best of' DVD collections from the mega-successful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unsolved-Mysteries/dp/B000E0OBJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unsolved Mysteries</a>&nbsp;television series.  There are 26 thought provoking UFO stories featured here totaling over 360 minutes.  Bonuses include a touching tribute to the late Robert Stack, commentaries on selected segments, and a behind-the-scenes look at the 150th solved mystery.  This set is unique in that despite one's personal opinion on UFOs, these stories are grandly entertaining thanks to the fantastic re-enactments and first person accounts.  This show was truly ahead of it's time in terms of the vast array of mysteries it covered and the groundbreaking special effects that it employed (which still hold up today).  I must admit that watching these tales again gave me chills before going to sleep, and I can usually sit through the scariest horror film without flinching.  I suppose it's the knowledge that such phenomena have been documented by people from all walks of life that makes it hard to ignore as simply fantasy.  My only real gripe about this set was that as a fan of the series, I missed seeing and hearing the classic 'Unsolved Mysteries' opening sequence.  What's presented on these discs is the re-worked opening and ending credits from the Lifetime channel repeats.  No big deal to casual fans, but die hard fans will surely miss it.  Overall, this was a terrific inaugural release in a slew of DVD collections from one of the best TV shows of all time!",1094860800,4,1606,5.518367346938776

2080578,5,B0002DRE0Y,"I bought this item and have recently viewed disc one last night. The stories are amazing and so realistic. If you are a fan of this show, or even if your not, I would reccommend getting this set. Unsolved Mysteries features TRUE real life experiences on disappearances, miracles, mysterious happenings, and more. The UFO set is great. I am planning on purchasing all sets when they are released.

The video quality is great and the menus are interactive while playing the theme song. The Robert Stack Tribute is a biography on his life. The creators of Unsolved Mysteries announce that they were very careful to put UFO stories on TV, they wanted all the sources credible and had done alot of research on their experiences. The 150th solve is a review of the previous years and solved cases.

I would reccommend this set to an Unsolved Mysteries, Reality, Mystery, Suspense, UFO fan.",1094688000,5,883,4.802631578947368

Many more episodes that wasn't named will also be on this set. Also there is a documentary on Robert Stack on this set and possibly commentarys. From the pictures I saw on tvshowsondvd.com these look to be thin packs that will be stored in a slipcase similar to Three's Company Season 2. I also recommend Unsolved Mysteries Ghosts.",1091664000,11,785,5.233870967741935

2080581,3,B0002DRE0Y,Two of the disc skipped right out of the package.  For something this expensive you'd expect that not to happen.  Has me leary of buying any other unsolved mysteries sets.  Not so much the sellers fault.,1471478400,,203,4.583333333333333

2080584,4,B0002DRE0Y,"These are so well-made so still today they are great and well made. I recommend that to everyone with good taste. I miss this and other decent shows. I have gladly cut off my TV/cable services about 3 years ago and will never waste another penny on the garbage. Thank God for these DVDs and other good shows. I think Amazon has the old series called One Step Beyond. I am going to look and see If they got it... I recommend that to everyone too. (True stories, a lot better than Twilight Zone)",1449187200,,493,4.25531914893617
2080585,5,B0002DRE0Y,"This UM set turned me into a UFO buff.  I never knew or really cared about the Roswell story until seeing that segment. Man, is it a good one. It's the credibility of these people that really give these stories legs to stand on. A powerhouse of cool stories including a guy who still has marks on his chest from when a ufo burned him. When you have groups of military men saying they saw floating lights zipping around in a forest, how can you not take pause. It has great interviews from those who witnessed these strange occurrences while the government basically goes silent. You'll just have to see these and have an open mind.",1446508800,,631,4.439655172413793
2080586,3,B0002DRE0Y,"Love the show but this set isn't the strongest. Some episodes are true miracles from a higer power and some just aren't very solid, nice ideas with little facts or much going on to prove either side. This took away the depth for me. The Urban Legends collection and Bizarre Murders are my fav's. So happy I have hours of TV edits on DVD too, the show found the most bizarre stories around. So many cases that will never see the light of day again due to many factors. Robert Stack was the best.",1446508800,,494,4.26595744680851
2080587,4,B0002DRE0Y,"I was a huge fan of the Robert Stack ""Unsolved Mysteries"" episodes when I was younger. I was absolutely thrilled to find these episodes on DVD and couldn't wait to get them all. I remembered many of the episodes from my youth and others were new to me. These are great for binge watching. The casing isn't the greatest, but as long as you store them properly, they should hold up.",1445904000,,380,4.366197183098592

2080594,5,B0002DRE0Y,"Most of these episodes are well constructed and very informative. The technique of incorporating reenactments, eyewitness interviews, scientist's & skeptic perspectives keeps the stories entertaining in an often unsettling way. Like, "" Holy sh*t! That one had to be real!"" Only one or two episodes fall short, mostly because they're short segments that skimp on this additional contextual analysis. Lots of lesser known (to me at least) incidents discussed along with the classics like Roswell.",1428710400,2,494,5.6

2080607,5,B0002DRE0Y,"Being a Robert Stack fan & collector of this series, I had to have it There are so many shows these days about UFO's, it makes one wonder. If only one story is true, then they exist. Actually in life I've found that although many don't know what behind the beyond, most people I've met don't know what's beyond their behind. Enjoy the show & wonder!!",1403740800,,350,4.318181818181818

2080614,4,B0002DRE0Y,"This is a great buy for me who, has a fascination for the unknown, which remains to this day.
Why the Governments try to hide this away from the public I cannot understand.
It is only a matter of time until it can no longer be covered up and denied.

Unsolved Mysteries? Not unsolved by all it seems?",1380499200,,300,4.172413793103448
2080615,5,B0002DRE0Y,Great show with great re-enactments. Robert Stack made this show what it was. I would recommend this box set to anybody who was a fan of the show.,1377302400,,146,4.25
2080616,4,B0002DRE0Y,"I loved this show growing up, as a paranormal fan this was main information source before the internet. The storys are short and sweet so you will get many to watch, there is an investigation that involves interviews with eye hand witnesses and then actors who play the story as it happened. The researchers must have been on the ball because many of the storys that I was first introduced to here almost twenty years ago stand the test of time and some are world famous. Its an easy watch and the way the story is presented STILL send give me goose bumps. There is no great insight and you can find details about the cases on line and some cases have had novels researched about them. Its worth watching, just look for a deal, no need to pay top dollar.",1376092800,,754,4.3546099290780145
2080617,5,B0002DRE0Y,Unsolved Mysteries is Worth Buying this show is well put together. I give this a five star rating and the show was the best at the time it was in production.,1370131200,,157,4.096774193548387

2080624,5,B0002DRE0Y,"Bought this because my husband and i wanted to check it out. I own other copies of the unsolved mysteries. Some stories in this disc set are chilling! Makes you think what else has the government and military have been hiding!! I have to admit other stories on here are laughable! For example, What sane person would be standing outside looking up at some huge unknown space craft that is hovering closely above their house? I myself would scream and run inside!! Anyway, very happy i purchased this!!",1362787200,2,501,4.704545454545454
2080625,4,B0002DRE0Y,"This is my third copy of the unsolved mysteries. So far i have bought Ghost, UFO's and now miracles. Miracles i liked but it had to many religious stories going on.

2080635,5,B0002DRE0Y,I love this show. Still working on trying to get them all. The best tv series to ever come out if you were to ask me. Thanks amazon,1326499200,,131,3.7142857142857144
2080636,5,B0002DRE0Y,"I have a lot of documentary on DVD. From Cities of the Underworld to almost anything made by the history channel I have a lot of DVDs about History, True Crimes and the Paranormal. After all these years and countless Hours spent in front of the TV I think my Unsolved Mysteries DVDs are still my favorites.

I bought this set 4 years ago and I still watch it all the time, this DVD set is just unbelievable, in my opinion the second best DVD set ever made (right after Unsolved Mysteries: Strange Legends). There's just too many amazing stories featured on this set: The Roswell Incident, Bentwaters, Allagash, The Hudson Valley sightings, The Belgium sightings, The Roswell/Area 51 Connection, The ""Guardian"" UFO video, The Men in Black, The Mexico sightings, The Phoenix lights, Investigation about Alien Abductions, Crop Circles.......

This set is just incredible, so fun to watch, I know I'll watch all these segments over and over again for the next 4+ years !! Buy this DVD, it's that good. :)",1307923200,,1000,4.77456647398844
2080637,5,B0002DRE0Y,"This DVD is very good.  What I like about it is that it covers, in some detail, a number of the best sightings. It fills in the gaps because it's a set of 4 discs and can do that.  Some DVSs spend 5-10 min. on one sighting but this DVD can spend 15-20+ minutes on a sighting, which is what I personally like.  (It does a very good job of the Belgian sighting and the Hudson Valley sighting, to name just 2) - there are more! I also have ""Phoenix Lights"" and ""I Know What I Saw"" and these 2 are a MUST HAVE!.  This one is a must also.  Music is VERY good - I think I could have bought it for the music alone!  The extras are very good too. This is a very nice presentation all around - extremely interesting and, I must say, scary.  You will not be disappointed with this one.",1305504000,3,775,3.9294871794871793
2080638,4,B0002DRE0Y,This contains a good assortment of the interesting UFO episodes.  A couple of the episodes are also repeated on the Best Of Unsolved Mysteries set.,1284336000,,147,4.88
2080639,5,B0002DRE0Y,"Of all the segments on Unsolved Mysteries, the Unexplained is one of the best.  I have not seen on other networks the unbiased, truly captivating, and factual presentation of UFOs and abductions as Unsolved Mysteries. Some of the most memorable stories were Missing Time, Roswell, and the Alagash abductions.  As another review stated, the Missing Time episode actually terrified me as a kid watching it and helped generate my interest in the UFO mystery.  I had many sleepless nights.  I would highly recommend watching it somewhere remote to get the real effect.

For anybody who has a general interest in the UFO mystery, I suggest watching this collection, then watch the ""UFO"" shows on the networks and judge for yourself.",1279411200,,727,5.025
2080640,4,B0002DRE0Y,"I held off on buying this for years, but I'm glad I finally did. Being Catholic, I find the Catholic-related stories to be the best. ""Lucky School"" was a very good non-denominational story. ""Lucky Choir"" proves that a coincidence is a miracle in which god wishes to remain anonymous. Some stories however do not fit, like ""Police Woman Savior"" and ""Money From Heaven."" ""Kentucky Visions"" was about people who are just too eager to believe in miracles. Some seem to be paranormal in nature but later appear to have an Earthly explanation, like ""Miracle Staircase."" ""M.S. Miracle"" really straddles the line between luck and miracle. Overall, enjoyable and positive stories.",1259366400,3,671,5.109090909090909
2080641,5,B0002DRE0Y,"In my ongoing search for quality documentary series that are free of hype, sensationalism and annoying editing effect (shaky camera movements, rapid zoom ins/outs, fast forwarding, flashing bright screens between shots and other useless visual pollution) I recently bought the ""Unsolved Mysteries: UFOs"" DVD collection. Unsolved Mysteries was a popular TV program investigating real-life mysteries, missing persons, conspiracy theories, unsolved crimes, and unexplained paranormal phenomena like alien abductions, ghosts, and UFOs. The program was hosted by Robert Stack, and was shown from 1987 to 2002. I occasionally watched it during the late 1980s and early 1990s and even taped a few episodes.

In 2004 a ""UFOs"" DVD set was released which contains all the best UFO segments from the program (26 segments on 4 DVDs, 360 minutes). The Unsolved Mysteries team investigated many famous UFO sightings including the Rendlesham forest incident, Allagash Abductions, Roswell, Area 51, Phoenix lights and many others. I really enjoyed watching all 26 segments, some of which are very captivating. They are all high quality - especially the actual reconstruction of events based on eyewitness testimony is impressive. All stories investigated are presented in a serious, free of sensationalism, and a fairly objective manner. If you are interested in the UFO phenomena you will most likely enjoy watching this UFO DVD collection.",1253318400,8,1425,5.597222222222222

Most of the segments are pretty good and a couple segments like ""Nazca Lines"" and ""The Blob"" have nothing to do with UFOs and don't belong on this boxset, but are still interesting. You'll see alot of the same footage used over and over again in some segments. This isn't a bad thing but it does get a little repetitive. Also, Raymond Burr, Karl Malden, Keely Shaye Smith and Virginia Madsen do not appear anywhere on this boxset despite having their names listed on the Amazon page. Robert Stack is the only host!

2080647,5,B0002DRE0Y,"Eminently watchable collection of UFO stories which run the gamut from  the sighting of strange lights in the sky to the disturbing cases of alleged alien abduction.  It also delves into some mysteries associated with ufology such as crop circles and interesting features on the Martian landscape.  Though some of the segments are now nearly 20 years old, they retain a certain timeless relevance and this collection should be enjoyed well into the future.  I've owned this set for nearly a year, and still find myself popping in one of the discs at least a couple of times a month to watch a few of the more engaging stories.

  Robert Stack is the embodiment of understated excellence as the host/narrator of the segments and the show does a great job of getting the actual witnesses and other relevant parties featured in the episodes.  While I found all of the episodes watchable, a couple of them (Hot Wheels-sized UFOs eradicating a woman's cancer and the cartoonishly-bad segment on Men In Black running amok in Central Texas) didn't seem to measure up to the rest of the collection.  Still, it's a great DVD box set and anyone with even a passing interest in ufology should thoroughly enjoy it.",1197849600,3,1202,4.796116504854369

2080649,5,B0002DRE0Y,"Robert Stack did a great job of trying to maintain a balance between skepticism and sincere witness testimony. The UFO encounters on this DVD set are all food for thought. My own opinion though, is that no serious consideration was given to the possibility that our military may actually have this technology. It doesn't seem likely to me that ""aliens"" couldn't find something better to do that ""experiment"" in much the same ways that Nazis and other eugenic fanatics would do. After all, they would have to  be ""light years"" ahead of us in science and technology in order to get here. Right? But most of the encounters smack of ""mind control"" experiments which our own Pentagon would be interested in right now -- at our current level of technology. Any super-advanced civilization would surely be far past this stage by now! That even applies to some of the medical technology used in the ""abduction"" scenarios. Nevertheless, considering the impossibility of pointing the finger at the Pentagon and still getting it on the air, I would say Robert Stack and his staff did an outstanding job.",1169510400,4,1092,4.870967741935484

2080651,3,B0002DRE0Y,"Unsolved Mysteries was really very well done as a series, at least in its early years.  I remember as a kid being totally captivated by the fascinating stories and often being scared by the foreboding music and Robert Stack's deep, ominous voice.  I was particularly terrified by the UFO segments.  I believed the claims of alien visits were real.  Now, however, it's clear to me that the UFO stories are hoaxes.  Some are easy to spot while others are quite elaborate, but the simple truth is that not one -- not a single one -- of the thousands of the UFO from outerspace claims have been proven true.  Unsolved Mysteries, I now realize, was irresponsible for almost never seriously challenging those making claims of paranormal activity.  The reason why is obvious.  If they brought on experts to refute ghost, psyhic, bigfoot, and UFO enthusiasts, the episodes would be less compelling from an entertainment perspective.  Skepticism doesn't emote.  So if you look at these stories as entertainment, fine.  But they're not science!  I wonder if Robert Stack was ever ashamed of glorifying and spreading myths, superstitions, and hoaxes on gullible viewers or if he was gullible himself and never doubted the lines he was told to read.",1162598400,,1237,4.951456310679611

The commentaries also revealed interesting facts, such as the statistic that 1,200 UM segments were filmed (only about 10% of segments have made it to dvd, however.) The only disappointment is that they state that 30 UFO segments were filmed for UM, but only 26 are in this set, so they all easily could have been included.

2080653,5,B0002DRE0Y,"An excellent series with many interesting stories. Unsolved Mysteries with Robert Stack.
Episodes
Disk 1- Bentwaters UFO- Bentwater England, while on patrol, Air force officer John Burroughs saw lights flash in Rendelsham Forest. A team of UFO searchers investigated- giving one of the most credible sights to date.
Allagash Abductions- about 4 men who are camping in Alagash Wilderness who believe they were abducted by aliens. All 4 saw the ship.
Crop Circles- Crop Circles discovered in Canada- Real or Hoaxes? You decide.
Phoenix UFO- Story about a strange V formation of lights that appeared over Phoenix and Flagstaff- it was all captured on video.
Nazca Lines- Peru's Nazca Plateau, a one hundred square mile area, contains 100's of lines that converge in geometric perfection and giant figures formed by single continuous strokes have been inexpicably etched in the earth. Many think they were etched 1000's of years ago by alien visitors.
Mexico UFO- Since the last solar eclipse in July 1991, there have been 1000's of UFO Sightings throughout Mexico.
Vancouver Lights-Canadian housewife Dorothy Izalt has seen and photographed a series of bizarre lights that appear in the skies above her home. She believe they are UFO's attempting to communicate with her.

Disk 2-Roswell- 1947, Rancher Mac Brazel claimed to have found a crashed UFO on his land. The wreckage had Egyptian Hieroglyphics. Evidence suggest that Government or military officials removed evidence and covered up the incident. Now a new eyewitness account suggests that, the Army, did in fact recover the bodies of Alien beings. Very interesting.
Roswell/Area 51 Connection= About the site where the experimental aircrafts are tested but some have reported seeing UFO'S. Unsolved Mysteries talks to a former employee there who says an alien spacecraft is stored there, measuring 53 feet in diameter.
Hudson Valley UFO- during a 3 year period residents reported seeing enormous wedge-shaped light formations. Was it really UFO's or stunt pilots playing tricks? Whatever it was, it was unearthly.
Belgian UFO- Over 3000 reported sightings of alien craft, including pilots of the Belgian Air Force, who recorded the dramatic otherworldly movements of the craft. Movements that could not be performed by any aircraft of earth.
Falcon Lake UFO- Former Skeptic, Stepehn Michalak says an otherwordly aircraft visited him, leaving a bizarre pattern of scars on his torso. Doctors cant explain the burns, other than they say it resembles radiation poisioning.
UFO Healing- Lyonne Plasktt was diagnosed with T-cell Lyphoma and was given 3 months to live. According to her, Visitors from another planet levitated her, surrounded her by 8-inch disks and cured her.

Disk 3-Australian UFO- A pilot takes off and disapears from radar. His last transmission ''It is hovering and it is not an aircraft'' leads people to think he saw a UFO. Other witnesses saw it.
Missing Time- Researcher Bud Hopkins has investigated over 200 accounts of ''missing time'' people who believe they were abducted by UFO's and subjected to genetic experimentation by their abductors. Their accounts are chilling and very believable.
Socorro Close Encounter- Lonnie Zamora, A respected member of the community & Socorro police officer, saw a UFO while chasing a teenager into the dessert. Once investigated they found indentations and burn marks from the spaceship.
Kecksburg UFO- 1965, Kecksburg Pennsylvania; residents observed a fiery object streak through the sky and fall to earth. Military investigated the quarantined area. while officers secretely removed the object from the earth. It was 9 inches long, bronze colored and shaped like an acorn with unusual symbols.
Texas UFO- While driving on a Texas Highway 3 people spotted a fiery UFO. They suffered radiation burns, but the military reported nothing strange int he area that night, denying responsibility for the radiation burns, subsequently, one of the witnesses died of cancer.
Face On Mars- Photographs beamed to earth fromthe voyager space probe seem to depict 3 faces and a series of pyramid like formations on the surface of Mars. One of the faces is a match for the face on the Sphinx in Egpyt. Is this a natural phenomena or the work of an intellignet life form? Very interesting.

Disk 4-Men In Black- If you ever report that you've seen a UFO, the ''Men In Black'' may visit you. Who are they and do they exist? These accounts by eyewitnesses are disturbing evidence the ''Men In Black'' that were spoofed in the movie, actuallly exist and there is nothing funny about them.
Canadian UFO- Shortly after UFO sighting is reported, a mysterious videotape emerges depicting the event. Who sent the tape? Where is the UFO from?
Wheatfields Visitations- Since 1970, Southern England has been the site of more than 750 formed and unexplainable circles in wheat and cornfields. Some believe they may be connected to nearby Stonehenge monoliths and the appearance of unexplained lights in the night sky. Comes with an update.
Life Of Mars- Possible evidence of Life on Mars is found in a meteorite. This is only the 12th meteorite from Mars found on Earth. Its also 4.5 Billion years old, it pre-dates life on Earth by 1 Billion years and within it, some say, are the fossilized remains of micro-organisms.
Interceptors- Aviation researchers believe that a new generation of sophisticated military aircraft is being developed, using mind-boggling technology. Some think the technology for such an aircraft may have come from alien technology.
The Blob- Six times over a three-week period blob-like droplets of strange, gelatinous goo fell on the town of Oakville, Washington. Dozens of residents became ill with flu-like symptoms and several animals died. No one can determine how the goo, containing two types of bacteria and other living cells, fell from the sky.
UFO Odyssey- From 1987-1990, a wave of UFO sightings have fascinated the small community of Wytheville, VA, but nearby Langley Air Force Base will not investigate. One Citizen, Danny Gordon, continues researching and his life changed because of it.

2080654,1,B0002DRE0Y,"I agree with previous reviewers, I think this is the worst set of Unsolved Mysteries in the series. I'm a fan of the other Unsolved Mysteries sets, but the content of this set is redundant, 95% of it has such heavy religious connotations that borders on fanaticism. Many of which involved seeing visions in some places that are now called holy places which, incidentally, are crowded with tourists and relics sellers. Sounds to me like a great marketing ploy geared towards the desperate and fanatics.

If you're a moderate sensible person who would prefer miracle in the form of money falling out of the sky for the needy, or your departed loved ones sending you a message, you'd find less than 5% of this set entertaining. Go rent it or borrow it from someone if you're still curious about this set. If you can't speak 3 sentences without quoting the bible, run out and buy this set, you'll love it and praise the Lord it's created!",1143590400,5,934,4.626506024096385
2080655,5,B0002DRE0Y,"This set is for anyone, who like myself, would watch this show at night as a child and would find themselves unable to sleep that night.

  This set contains the best UFO segments featured on the show. I remember most of them and there really isn't one that I haven't seen on this set. The reenactments are wonderfully vivid, sometimes just hinting at what was seen which left the viewer to create that in his mind. Robert Stack's scenes with him dressed for a chilly evening, speaking to you from an obscure location as if this was a private meeting between you and him added so much to the segments. That and the detached glee the producers used in terrifying the audience. Very recommended.",1128211200,5,693,4.57258064516129
2080656,2,B0002DRE0Y,"I loved watching ""Unsolved Mysteries"" back in its TV heyday.  But, this ""Miracles"" edition is just too uncomfortable to sit through.  These stories on ""Miracles"" are more for the weak-minded, naive, religious-types, than those with reasonable common sense.  Don't get me wrong.  I do believe in God.  Absolutely!  God answers my questions because he's granted me the ability to process realities to know what my answers will be.  I am fortunate to have things go my way.  But, I do work for it, I don't expect anyone to just provide for me.  I'm sure God appreciates that I make my own effort to excel positively, as I do.

I really don't believe that there are times when God will choose to intervene a pending tragedy, when so many times, He will not.  Remember the Tsunami, just after Christmas, in a heavily Christian environment?  Yeah right, God was there for them, wasn't He?  Fate is nothing more than the luck of the moment.  I'm sure God will say that we did something to our earth and caused this to happen, so it IS our fault.

I don't go around making myself sound ignorant by saying: ""God has put his hand into the intervention of this particular tragedy of which we have been spared"".  Give me a break!  I'm sure, in most of these questionable stories on this ""Miracles"" collection, there is a scientific explanation for what has happened.  Or, they are just well crafted hoaxes.  I wouldn't doubt that there could be desperate church parishioners trying to create an illusion of a godly presence in their church just to drum up some attention.

If one person said that a ""miracle"" happened, we'd think he or she was crazy, but if 3 or more people say that a ""miracle"" happened, that now makes it more possibly true?  If 5 or more people say so, then it must be a fact!

 I think some people give up their investigations too early, and therefore want to comfort themselves by saying that God did this.  God might even say: ""Hell, I had nothing to do with that! People are sure quick to give in to the fantasy of the fabricated power of prayer.""

These tabloid-worthy stories of the ""Miracles"" collection somewhat reduces the integrity of the show's appeal to me.  I'm glad this religious crap was separated from the others so that I can enjoy some of the more reasonable tangibility of the other stories.

We all have a conscience.  This is what controls our decisions to do good or bad.  Man invented something as to create an alternative to interpret how we deal with our conscience.  And he called it ""religion"".  And man learned how to make money from this cash-cow called religion. God is just another entity of commercialism.  I think we really did forget what Christmas is all about.  Today, Christmas is about Santa Claus and sales figures to compare to sales of the previous years, and Easter is about Easter bunnies and Easter eggs.  Good Friday, to some people, is just some great long three hour lunch hour at the bar.

 Man learned that he could use religion to take advantage of people.  The rich and the poor.  Yes, especially  the Poor!!  People who have next to nothing, who give what they can to a church or religious entity that already has so much more than them.  I believe God and I both kick back and laugh at that.

There are many facets of religion, and they all expect you to make a sacrifice (usually your money), to show your faith.  Because, man knows that some people are weak and insecure, so they need something to believe in because they don't really believe in themselves. And religious parents instill this insecurity into their children so they'll be messed up for life too (unless they start to learn to process common sense early enough in their life).

The church says that you'll be rewarded in the end.  Yeah, the rear end, I'm sure.  Get out your wallets, people!

I really doubt that I will be buying ""Unsolved Mysteries: Miracles, Volume Two"".  The ""UFO"" Collection can seem to be a little too far fetched too, even the ""Ghosts"" episodes, but they do contribute to what is called an unsolved mystery.  I'd definitely like to see more volumes of other themes made available.",1127952000,5,4132,4.602194787379973
2080657,4,B0002DRE0Y,"Not really damning Unsolved Mysteries with faint praise, just being realistic.

Overall a nicely put together and professionaly produced collection.  Best and most interesting episodes:

Bentwaters, Allagash, Crop pictographs, Hudson Boomerang (thank me very much!), Socorro, Belgium triangles, Kecksburg, Fyfe County sightings.

Most of the reenactments are portrayed with a respectable degree of fidelity - refreshing for mass media

on such a topic.  On the other hand, while the breadth of treatment over multiple subjects is typically TV-attention-span engaging, they all suffer from the medium's inherent shallowness and inability/unwillingness to satisfactorily investigate and  explore. However, this collection does provide a useful visual primer, and some fascinating glimpses of historic sightings.

Incidentally, the Robert Stack appreciation included in all these sets is a wonderful, heart-felt addition.  However, I cannot say the same for the few commentaries.  None add anything worthwhile to the background of the events themselves - as the truly interested would hope to discover - but instead provide the producers with an opportunity to congratualte themselves on jobs well done.

So, level your expectations and you will better appreciate these nicely done presentations. As far as narration, music, photography, editing and special effects are concerned I doubt we will ever see much better quasi-documentary results from network televsion.",1126915200,2,1463,5.952153110047847
2080658,5,B0002DRE0Y,"THE SHORT: An interesting collection of cases - some famous, some not, some just craft sightings and some going all the way to alien abductions. A good mix of UFO entertainment.

THE LONG: This was my first of three sets that I purchased from this series, and I was initially apprehensive- is it really more than 6 hours of segments cut straight from the Unsolved Mysteries show? Fortunately it's very correct advertising- 4 discs, each an hour and a half long, composed entirely of complete segments of the show introduced and narrated by Robert Stack. No filler, just segment after segment as if you made your own collection tape.

As stated, it's a mixed bag of segments. For the UFO buff, it's all good. There are stories that feature convincing camera footage of UFOs, segments that discuss crash sites such as Roswell, and episodes that chronicle supposed alien sightings and abductions. Some, like Roswell, have been discussed to death and may not do much (though in fairness it wasn't nearly as common when the show first aired the episode, but it could've been left behind on this set). Basically though, the set gives a good mix of stories that are in various places on the charts of fame and believability. Rather than focus on close encounters of any one kind, the package recounts stories of various types as well as tales on the periphery of UFO lore such as crop circles and the Nazca lines. It's sort of a UFO gift bag that covers all grounds of the subject.

Most of the stories, even the ones I already knew well, were presented in the serious, fairly objective manner typical to the show and were therefore interesting to watch. A couple segment commentaries per disc are included as well for updates here and there. In all, for just 20 bucks this was a solid investment.",1125446400,2,1790,4.694267515923567
2080659,4,B0002DRE0Y,"The long-running NBC-TV series ""Unsolved Mysteries"", hosted by the stoic Robert Stack, offered some excellent segments over the years on the UFO mystery. This four-disk DVD set features most of these UFO segments, complete with excellent re-creations of each incident by actors, interviews with the witnesses and/or abductees and prominent UFO researchers, and occasional interviews with UFO skeptics. Unfortunately, some of these UFO stories have lost some of their credibility over the years. The ""Roswell/Area 51"" segment features an interview with Bob Lazar, who claimed in the 1990's that he had worked on alien technology at Area 51. However, it has since been discovered that much of his story is suspect, and he has been largely discredited even within the UFO community. The same applies to the segment on the supposed ""Face on Mars"", which UFO researcher Richard Hoagland claimed was a huge monument built by aliens, and that NASA covered up evidence of its reality. But a flyby by a NASA probe a few years ago revealed that the ""Face"" was really just lights and shadows, and Hoagland has been exposed as something of a con artist by other UFO researchers. A few of the other UFO segments also feature ""witnesses"" whose stories struck me as being dubious. Even so, this DVD set also features plenty of UFO incidents which have yet to be explained, even after thorough research by ""believers"" and ""skeptics"", and I certainly wouldn't agree with a previous poster that all UFO cases are just a bunch of ""tall stories"". Among the best segments are those on the Kecksburg UFO incident, which was witnessed by dozens of people in the area around Kecksburg, Pennsylvania in 1965; the Bentwaters/Rendlesham Forest Incident in 1980, which involved US military personnel (who are interviewed); the UFO ""landing"" in 1964 in Socorro, New Mexico, which was investigated by the US Air Force, who concluded that the policeman involved did see something strange (both the policeman and others involved in the case are interviewed); and the baffling Australian case in which a young pilot on a routine flight vanished while talking to a local airport controller (the controller is interviewed, and a transcript of their conversation is read by actors) - the pilot claimed a mysterious object was buzzing his plane, and then he vanished. IMO, this DVD set is worth buying simply for these few stories alone. The DVD extras feature a tribute to the late Robert Stack, and a segment describing how seriously the producers took each UFO incident they showed on the series. Overall, this DVD set is well worth the money - and any UFO buff or anyone who's interested in the paranormal will love it!",1118275200,11,2686,4.997767857142857
2080660,5,B0002DRE0Y,"Anyone with even a remote interest in the possibility of extra-terrestrial life will love Unsolved Mysteries: UFOs. After watching all four discs, you must ask yourself, ""Just what if...?"" I'm a fairly skeptical guy, and even I went to bed several nights asking myself this question after watching these episodes.

I can't say that there is a single bad episode contained within this set. Some of the more bizarre and memorable episodes include ""Roswell,"" ""Kecksburg UFO,"" ""UFO Healing,"" ""Australia UFO,"" ""Missing Time,"" ""Canadian UFO,"" and ""Alagash Abductions.""

As a kid watching the show on NBC, ""Missing Time"" and ""Alagash Abductions"" gave me nightmares. Check it out for yourself and see why.

2080663,5,B0002DRE0Y,"The shroud of turin, visions of mary, bleeding statues, a lady frozen face down in the snow overnight in sub zero temperatures brought back to life 8 hours later, a baby that died at birth and breathed again 6 hours later, the power of prayer to save a life. This is just a dose of the miracles that you will enjoy that will really touch your soul. You can say that this is ""relgious collection"" but I think the non-believers and skeptics should take a gander at what these fantastic documentaries offer. It's another view into the ""unexplained"" that truly defies science in nearly every documentary. The documentaries are excellently produced and many are filmed exactly where the miracles happened with the real people that experienced it. Expect tears to roll for many of these especially if you take them to heart yourself. The narratives of Robert Stack is just the icing on the cake. If you want the ultimate ""miracle"" collection, look no further, Unsolved Mysteries gave us 13 years of it, now it's all together in a collection with no commercials! A nice tribute to Robert Stack and introduction by the producers of the Miracles Stories is also included.",1101859200,12,1162,4.786069651741293
2080664,5,B0002DRE0Y,"As with the ""Ghosts"" collection DVD box set, this UFO collection is a must have for any Unsolved Mysteries fan, and certainly anyone who is interested in UFO's. I think I watched this entire collection within 4 days, that is how glued to it I was. Quality entertainment with some very shocking UFO stories that will make you wonder, ""are we alone"". Robert Stacks voice really makes the grade and I can't get enough of the man. I warming ""remember documentary"" is included with every boxed set and is well deserved. Robert will be missed. Keep the legend's voice going buy getting this DVD collection, you'll really love every minute of it!",1101081600,33,639,4.714285714285714
2080665,3,B0002DRE0Y,"The 'Miracles' DVD set is my least favorite of the 'Unsolved Mysteries' releases so far.  Most of the stories tend to be very redundant, with some life threatening obstacle such as frostbite being overcome through seemingly divine intervention.  To its credit, all of the stories are very inspirational (for those who are seeking that) but I prefer the spooks that I've come to associate with 'Unsolved Mysteries'.  I did, however, enjoy some of the more historical religious stories such as Our Lady of Guadalupe and the Shroud of Turin.  These featured some fantastic movie-worthy recreations and were simply more mysterious than some guy suddenly coming out of a Coma.  In closing, I think those who are more religiously inclinded will find this set the most enjoyable.  For others, I would recommend some of the other 'Unsolved Mysteries' sets such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/UFOs/dp/B0002DRDWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">UFOs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghosts/dp/B0002DRE0O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghosts</a>.",1100649600,17,1129,6.698630136986301
2080666,5,B0002DRE0Y,"This is the third volume of Unsolved Mysteries released by First Look. And it's just as good as the other two: Ghosts and UFOs. These stories on Miracles are inspirational and very touching. Some of the segments may freak you out, like many Unsolved Mysteries episodes. Enjoy!",1100649600,9,276,4.8936170212765955
2080667,1,B0002DRE0Y,"Some years back,I viewed a more credible show than this one called ""Arthur C Clarke's Mysterious Universe"" and they proved that a film of a ""flying saucer"" crossing the mountains was in fact a Cessna aircraft. Some years later I saw another show investigating mysteries and,low and behold,there was the same film(that already had been proven to be a Cessna)once again portrayed as a ""flying saucer"". The bottom line is that these shows need product and tall stories are not beyond them.
The ""Arthur C Clarke's Mysterious Universe"" DVD also had interviews with people that showed how they had created crop circles and yet we still have this fallacy being promoted as a mystery. That Arthur C Clarke DVD is a much better buy than this one.
The bottom line is to take these shows with a grain of salt. Roswell/Area 51 has been proven to be a myth as has Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster.""The Prophecies Of Nostradamus"" special told us the world was going to end in 1999. Wrong again. These are tall stories folks and should be treated as such. This show is entertaining and Robert Stack is a good host,so if you like tall stories then buy it,otherwise save your money.",1097971200,2,1166,4.665048543689321
