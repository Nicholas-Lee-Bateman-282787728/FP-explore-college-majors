8345042,5,B001UUXJIE,"Under the unfortunate but creative time under communism the Polish created some of the greatest works of animation that have ever been done and you can see some of the best pieces here. A result of 'something to fight against' created some sublime art. A chance to step outside of the drudgery of capitalismus!  If you want a film education see these!!!
Purely brilliant!",1301529600,2,371,4.796875
