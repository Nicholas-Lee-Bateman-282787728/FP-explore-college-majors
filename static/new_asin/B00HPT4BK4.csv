6195133,5,B00HPT4BK4,Very cute very well done series. My only gripe is like every other mystery series they always release the non US friendly versions first. What's the point? Obviously if they can eventually release them in US format why not just do so at the same time?,1409356800,12,251,4.478260869565218

Must see.",1404604800,9,146,4.25
6195137,5,B00HPT4BK4,"I love this series. Brings out the personalities of each character perfectly and makes you feel like they are people you might meet during an ordinary day. The plots are always interesting, with a touch of humor, and it's always fun to try and solve the mystery before the end.",1403827200,10,277,4.56

6195143,5,B00HPT4BK4,"This season started with a big shock, and continued the standards of past seasons--acting, writing--all top level. A fun series if you like mysteries that offer a few twists and add in humor. The relationships are a HUGE plus in this series. Each character has his/her specific style, sometimes clashing, but always ending up blending together to get the job done and wrap up with a drink at Katherine's bar.",1497225600,2,408,4.8428571428571425
6195144,5,B00HPT4BK4,The new lead detective Kris Marshall fits well with the team.  I liked how they made his personality different from Ben Miller's character.,1496707200,,139,5.043478260869565

6195150,5,B00HPT4BK4,"I so love this series!! Cannot say enough good things about it!!  Found it on Netflix, and while I'm still able to watch seasons 1-4 and recently added season 5!  With Netflix you never know, here today gone tomorrow. So....I'm not taking any chances and getting this whole series on DVD. Have to say, seasons 1 & 2, my faves. Only because of Ben Miller. He so nailed the role of DI Poole. While I miss him, I am enjoying watching Kris Marshall work. However, season 3 he's so bumbling. Kind of annoying and really not necessary as he's a great detective.
  Episode 1 of season 3, so sad. Inspector  Poole is killed and the team reacting to the loss of their chief is heartbreaking.  Yet Humphrey steps in, knowing he's an outsider, yet determined to find out who killed their ""friend"". He captures your heart right then and there. Rest of the episodes continue to be as enjoyable. No foul language, no blood and gore, no unnecessary sex and violence. One big reason I watch Death in Paradise.
Now thanks to Amazon, I have the dvds and I can watch as much as I want.",1491264000,,1066,4.413265306122449

6195159,5,B00HPT4BK4,"Excellent filmography, very correct backgrounds and stand-ins as required by a well-written script. However, killing off Poole in the final episode was in poor taste; he could have been transferred back to Scotland Yard seamlessly with minor changes in the story. His replacement, on the other hand, is obviously a better choice for the series; disheveled, clumsy, and a brilliant DI. Great series, very British, yet island-smart, as the toasts held at the end of each episode (beer bottles in hand) indicate!",1485907200,,509,5.219512195121951
6195160,5,B00HPT4BK4,I love British comedy and mysteries of the cozy variety that don't use profanity or are lewd and Death in Paradise definitely fits bill. It's not corny and plots are not farfetched. I hope to collect all of them!,1485734400,,212,4.461538461538462

6195167,5,B00HPT4BK4,My 11 year olds and I love this show. It's primarily Agatha Christie-type murder mysteries that keep the audience engaged and thinking.

While the first episode of the show has the team stuggling to work together, it is all quickly pulled together and the cast and stories become quickly firm and solid.  From what I've heard Death In Paradise is England's number 1 mystery/crime show.  It's light, colorful, great characters and a joy to watch.  But for a small island they sure have a lot of people that get murdered!  Must be killer for the tourist trade!  Just kidding.  Start with Season 1 and work your way through the season.

6195256,5,B00HPT4BK4,"When Ben Miller decided to leave the cast of ""Death in Paradise"" after two seasons there was a fair amount of trepidation among fans of this light-hearted British/French detective series.
Miller, after all, had made his mark as the wool-suited Inspector Richard Poole, the detective who had been (unwillingly) posted to the exotic Caribbean island of Saint Marie. Pedantic, never married, and a man who seemingly did not know how to unbend when off duty, Poole solved crimes because - when all was said and done - he was a very good detective.
The producers solved the problem of replacing him in a deft - and unique - way by not simply killing him off but having him solve his own murder with the help of newly arrived DI Humphrey Goodman (played with awkward charm by Kris Marshall.) They were also wise, I think, in developing Goodman's character as the polar opposite of Poole. Goodman, unlike Poole, is anxious to blend in. To him, this is not an unwanted temporary posting but is, instead, an opportunity for a fresh start in an exotic new place. Married, he is looking forward to life on the island.
Things go wrong for him almost from the start, however. The three members of the Honore police force are still grieving for Poole when he arrives and look at him as something of a bumbler after he falls off a balcony while investigating the death of his predecessor. He also discovers, fairly quickly, that his wife isn't coming to the island; is, in fact, leaving him. Unlike Poole, who believed in procedure and didn't lack confidence, Goodman is more intuitive and early on admits that he often feels unsure of himself despite the fact that he is a good detective with an excellent reputation. It's also clear that he is somewhat flummoxed when he discovers that he has to work with Sergeant Camille Bordey (played wonderfully by Sara Martins.) She's smart, confident, and sexy and Goodman never seems quite sure how to act around her. Danny John-Jules as Officer Dwayne Myers and Gary Carr as Sergeant Fidel Best do much of the heavy lifting in this season as they did in the first two.
This series continues the show's tradition of working humor into the scripts: One notable example is a conversation Dwayne and a local tour guide have over an extinct parrot in which they do a subtle homage to the classic Monty Python skit about the mythical Norwegian Blue.
The end result: Despite Miller's departure, ""Death in Paradise"" remains a wonderful show with tightly written narratives, interesting plots and intriguing characters.",1448064000,3,2539,4.799086757990867

While the first two seasons were fascinating and delightful - largely due to Ben Miller's complex characterization and his interaction with Sara Martins , the last season is adequately humorous, but not riveting.  The loss of the conflict between British upper class reserve and.

I stopped watching a lot because of the character that was put in Camille's place.  The obvious try at looking and acting like Camille is extremely annoying to me.  She went from a very properly dressed police officer to a barely dressed island girl.  The other actors are merely OK and the stories are no longer interesting.

The plot was  stupid; it didn't make sense that he would ascertain that a character was not who she said she was, and then go sit quietly down with his back to the group.  In fact, the whole reunion idea was silly; his character was unlikely to attend.
Richard Poole was my favorite character and your way of disposing of him was really difficult to watch, especially your unnecessary flashback to exactly how he died. Apparently you don't understand that your watchers get fond of characters and Ben Miller was the strength of the series.

But, I'm disappointed in the series because they have turned D.S. Camille Bordey (Sara Martins) into nothing but arm candy. Too bad. She is gorgeous but she could have played an important investigator counterpoint to Goodman. Plus, they had her flirting with Goodman beginning in the first show where Poole dies. Not funny.

The other cast members are EXCELLENT. The show has a very strong supporting staff and they really help to make this show a success. Even the Commissioner (Don Warrington) helps to round out the show and make it better.

The location, settings, directions, wardrobe, sound, etc. is all very good. Beautiful location! Well, there were several shots where you could tell that they were artificially padding the sounds in some of this seasons shows (sounds of breaking surf when the ocean was flat as a pond).

Where Richard was serious, uptight, funny without meaning to be and constantly pining for cold and rainy London, Humphrey is open, friendly, goofy, clumsy and thrilled to be where he is. Both detectives are equally brilliant, but in very different ways. This season was very good, but it takes a few episodes to feel comfortable with the new DI. I did miss what Richard brought to the show, but Humphrey is blazing his own trail and I am excited to see how he does with this clever, unique, beautifully shot mystery series.",1436313600,4,796,4.692857142857143

It's a ""fun"" murder mystery that can't be taken too seriously as if they really had this many murders they'd be the murder capitol of the world. As an aside  I've an English pal in his forties moved to an island off Belize, always reminds me of him. Hopefully when I visit there will be no murders.

6195324,4,B00HPT4BK4,"As I post this review there are already 32 reviews. I'll try not to repeat what others said but, since this is a mystery series - and it is the THIRD season - I'll assume that anyone here has already seen the first two. And, if you've read my other Mystery or crime DVD reviews on Amazon, you know I do not like SPOILERS! (Heck, what's the fun of a mystery if there is no - well - ""mystery"". I guess I have to tell you one thing that I didn't know beforehand (I hadn't read other reviews). Ben Miller - the lead character was leaving the cast and he does in Episode One (of the eight here). He gets a new replacement - another UK detective (DCI) played by Kris Marshall. Marshall continues the ""fish out of water"" situation that Miller played only he's different. He doesn't drink tea (like Miller) and is larger and most often stumbles all over himself. Think of a young Chevy Chase if he was British. (Miller reminded me a lot of David Frost). As was pointed out in a rather lengthy review here by reviewer ""Happy Reader"", there are bonus features on both discs. This is unusual. I would normally say to wait till you've seen all the episodes before watching the bonuses but it's okay to watch the Disc One bonuses (which focus on Miller's departure) and you won't find any ""spoilers"" there.

It's all subjective of course, but I couldn't relate to Marshall as I did with Miller (who I loved) and so I concentrated on the rest of the police staff and their characters. Sara Martins (as Officer Camille) is stunning and always great to watch. The other guys, especially Duane, are a lot of fun. The cases are all handled the same. At beginning someone is murdered and there is a group - usually 5 or 6 - who are suspects. At the end of each episode Marshall's character gathers all the suspects in a room and reveals the murderer. What kept me watching was the police staff. The suspects were nearly all one-dimensional and boring.

BTW, there is a short bonus on disc two called ""guest stars"", but it concentrates on the actors who were all in one episode and none that I was familiar with. There is a ""guest star"" who I recognized in one episode - I think it was 6 or 7. I recognized his voice. If you are a fan of ""Treme"" you will recognize Clark Peters who played the Mardi Gras Indian Chief. The final credits confirmed this.

Well, I've gone on too long already. There is a minor ""cliffhanger"" at the end, but the good new (good spoiler"" is that there is a series 4.

I hope you found this review both informative and Helpful.

6195330,5,B00HPT4BK4,"If you follow this series at all, you'll know ahead of time that DI Poole is going to be replaced in Season 3. But I didn't know how he was going to be replaced. What a great send-off they give him in episode 1 - great for a mystery lover! I read an interview where Ben Miller said he loved playing Poole, but he just didn't like being away from his very young child for 6 months at a time. In six months, you miss a LOT with a baby.

Kris Marshall comes in as DI Humphrey Goodman and I think he does a good job. He isn't trying to be Poole. Poole is buttoned up and slow to laugh and finds it hard to make small talk. DI Goodman is rumpled and cheerful and can't stop talking. What they have in common is excellent detecting instincts.

""Death in Paradise"" is a comedy with crime or a crime with comedy. Follow the 4-person staff of the Honore police department, on the Carribean island of St. Marie. The island is practically a character in the show. In the show, St. Marie is a Protectorate of Great Britain, which is why the police chief is an Englishman. Watch for things like what side of the car the driver sits on random cards on the street, though, and you'll note that where it films actually has French as the most recent influence. In any case, the whole Honore police staff have wonderfully written personalities - this mystery series is a joy to watch!

I remain a big fan after watching season 3, which originally aired January-March 2014.

In this Region 1 DVD release you get 2 discs with a total 472 minutes of excellent mysteries. The show is presented in 16:9 anamorphic and stereo sound. English subtitles are available for the programs. This is the first season of ""Death in Paradise"" where they've included DVD extras. They only total 18 minutes, but they're a start.

....Episode 1: DI Poole arrives at a beautiful house overlooking the ocean. Four people greet him with varying degrees of enthusiasm - it's a mini 25-year college reunion. ""Well"", Poole says in his inimitable way, ""This is fun"", without looking like he means it. Stranger still, he's brought a paperback book with him to the party, ""Stendhal: La Rouge et le Nor"". But he doesn't read French so why is he sitting on the veranda with it?
Hint: There is a method to DI Goodman's madness, when he goes on about the ancient riddle of The Fox, The Goose and the Bag of Beans (which has been told in many formats).
....Episode 2: ""The Wrong Man"" A young woman jogs through a decrepit sea-side village when she's surrounded by zombies. What! - Oh, it's a movie production. The star takes a break while her stand-in, Thea, rehearses. A zombie grabs Thea and she falls to the ground dead. That was not in the script.
This episode has a lovely grubby unlikable guest appearance for Peter Davison.
....Episode 3: ""An Artistic Murder"" The Pascal Gallery has a gala to show off a masterpiece by Saint Marie's most famous painter, dead since 1927. The painting will be auctioned the next day for a small fortune. The event is attended by Honor&eacute;'s movers & shakers including the Commissioner, a judge, and a wealthy woman with a young gigolo on her arm. The latter leaves the party alone and in a rush. What does he have to ""check on""? Something that leaves him shot to death a half hour later.
....Episode 4: ""Ye of Little Faith"" The airline has an agreement with the posh La Cr&eacute;ole Bech Htel & Spa, and employees often stay there for layovers. Tonight there's four of them to share dinner and drinks on the beach before heading up for bed. The only female, Tasha, doesn't come down for the crew bus in the morning. When they get into her room, she's lying dead across her bed with an open bottle of champagne and two flutes on the table. So who spent some extra time with Tasha?
....Episode 5: ""Political Suicide"" Jacob Doran is driven home in his limousine to be greeted by his wife with a giant slap to the face. His wife, son and press secretary stay up with him all night until it's confirmed, the morning headlines are going to be ""Commerce Minister Beds Intern"". Doran tells them, ""Whoever leaked this is out to destroy me... I can resign now or I can wait to be sacked... Thank you all for your support. I've got a letter to write."" He retires to his office and a short time later a shot rings out. But is it suicide? DI Goodman tells the Commissioner: ""In my experience, suicides rarely ever shoot themselves through their clothes. They put the gun muzzle to their skin - they want to make sure they don't miss.""
....Episode 6: ""The Early Bird"" The island is home to 16 species of parrot. Captain Jack leads birding tours into the parrot reserve. He's leading one now, with a group hoping to see the endangered Saint Marie Green in the morning. There's great hurry and consternation at dawn, however, when they discover that one of the birders has gone ahead alone. He'll probably scare the Greens off before anyone else can add them to their life lists. Or, he would have, if someone hadn't killed him at the viewing platform. As Goodman says, ""It would appear that the world of bird watching may be slightly more cut throat than one would assume.""
....Episode 7: ""The Man With the Golden Gun"" Near to Saint Marie is Sebastian Island. Property developer Alexander Jackson owns the whole island and it has only one house on it. His. No phone reception. No wi-fi. There he lives with his staff and, off and on, three disgruntled grown children. When the magnate is murdered during a seance, DI Goodman and his team have to motor over. A tropical storm strands everybody on the island. With a murderer.
....Episode 8: ""Rue Morgue"" Let's visit the Saint Marie Retirement Home, ""Where Life in Paradise Begins."" Not quite paradise. Dr. Emma Redding, Retired, is murdered by poison in her chicken curry. Who would want to murder an elderly woman nearly crippled by arthritis.

If you missed the 1st two seasons of ""Death in Paradise"", you are missing a real treat. If you have a choice, I recommend watching season 1 before 2, just because it gives you the full flavor of DI Poole's initial odd-man-out feeling, wearing a buttoned-up suit while everyone else is in shorts, etc.

Trivia: Danny John-Jules was already a hit in our house because he played the inimitable Cat in the TV series ""Red Dwarf"" (started 1988). Totally different from ""Death in Paradise"", of course, but you can see Cat's swagger in Officer Dwayne Myers.

If you are interested in the DVD set of Season 3, it is the first season of ""Death in Paradise"" to have DVD bonus extras. The Season 3 DVD set has 2 discs. The show is presented in 16:9 anamorphic and stereo sound. English subtitles are available for the programs. The DVD extras only total 18 minutes, but they're a start.
....Bonus Features (18 minutes total) Commentators include Ben Miller (plays DI Poole), Sara Martins (plays Camille), Danny John-Jules (plays Dwayne), Gary Carr (plays Fidel), Kris Marshall (plays DI Goodman), Don Warrington (plays the Commissioner), Matthew Ader (1st assistant director), Tim Bradley (producer), Toby Moore (cinematographer) and Peta Adderley (location manager),

..C. ""Ben's Day Off"" Straw hat, fresh fruit and rum.
..D. ""Harry the Lizard"" Harry is a favorite cast member. He's 100% CGI but doesn't look it. One of the tricks, per Toby Moore: ""We have a silver ball [that they place where Harry will be sitting, which] gives the guys back in London [CGI dept] a sense of where the light is coming from."" Makes for more realistic CGI. Pretty smart.
..E. ""Guest Stars"" Episode 1 guests only.
..F. ""Meet the Crew"" It is HOT on location. You can see the sheen on some actors' faces even though there are fans everywhere. When the camera runs, though, the fans need to be turned off. To communicate with the local crew the director had to learn some French, ""coupez les ventilos"" = Cut the Fans.
..G. ""Meet the Cast"" The challenges of filming in the Caribbean are the heat, the mosquitoes and ""there's far too much rum around.""

The characters feel almost like friends and you know that if you're having a bad day, they will always cheer you up.  Season three begins with the murder of DI Poole, which requires a new DI, Humphrey Goodman, to be sent to Saint-Marie to investigate.  Initially I was unsure how this new character would fit in but I quickly accepted him.  Although he's a brilliant detective like DI Poole, he is completely different.  Where Poole was brusque, extremely organized, meticulous and insists on wearing his dark wool suit everyday, Goodman is laid back, clumsy,disorganized and friendly.  As Kris Marshall stated, it's still a fish out of water show, it's just a different fish.  I'm also glad to see that my favorite character, Harry the lizard, seems to be featured a little more.  I was surprised to learn that Harry isn't real but rather a computer generated image but his creators have managed to make him not only extremely lifelike but also have given him a distinct personality.  Additionally, the third season DVD offers seven short ""Making of..."" extras, including how Harry the lizard is created.

This show is filmed on the French island of Guadeloupe and does a wonderful job of including local island traditions in the storylines.  Additionally, if you enjoy reggae music, you will hear quite a bit in this show.  The mysteries are interesting and entertaining, the violence is minimal and there is no foul language or sexual situations so this show is appropriate for almost everyone.

If you missed the 1st two seasons of ""Death in Paradise"", you are missing a real treat. If you have a choice, I recommend watching season 1 before 2, just because it gives you the full flavor of DI Poole's initial odd-man-out feeling, wearing a buttoned-up suit while everyone else is in shorts, etc.

The island, as they say in a bonus feature, is practically a character in the show.

Trivia: Danny John-Jules was already a hit in our house because he played the inimitable Cat in the TV series ""Red Dwarf"" (started 1988). Totally different from ""Death in Paradise"", of course, but you can see Cat's swagger in Officer Dwayne Myers.

6195363,5,B00HPT4BK4,"I love everyone in this cast. Having watched the first two seasons with Ben Miller as the inspector, I wasn't sure whether I wanted to transition to a new one. Ben fit so well with the team. But knowing that Ben had quit on his own (because of the heat) helped. Then the writers did a great job with the first episode of Season Three, respectful of Ben and a great introduction of Kris Marshall as the new inspector. He began to fit with the team as well. The writers came up with some brilliant 'locked room' mysteries, not only who-dun-it but how. And I watched the whole season in two days. Luckily the UK is releasing season 4 in March. I bought a region 2 player especially to watch great mystery series like this one, and not have to wait. Oh, did I mention the wonderful views of Sainte-Marie (Guadeloupe) and how the culture is included quite respectfully into the stories and is (as some of the cast say in the features on the third disc) a character in its own right. Highly recommended.",1424649600,42,997,4.394594594594595

6195365,5,B00HPT4BK4,"Still has me hooked. After a stunning season opener! we continue with the interworking's of the Honore police group and the odd crimes that occur in their wonderful tropic isle. We  now meet Humphrey the newest D.I. sent out from England and his attempts to work himself into the team and solve these perplexing crimes as they occur. I don't want to spoil any of the plots so I will say, just sit back and enjoy all of them as the writers add new levels to each of these fine actors personalities and histories. What makes this show so much fun is that I like all of the people I've met. the villains deserve what they get, and the good but shady folks usually do right in the end and allow the coppers to look the other way.( The Amazon Green) comes to mind.  So don't analyze them to death just enjoy.",1422144000,57,803,4.276315789473684
6195366,5,B00HPT4BK4,"Bought Seasons 1-3

Even though the series took an extreme and unexpected turn for Season 3, I still love the series.

The story of an out-of-his-element British policeman working in an island environment is well done.  The characters work well together; the stories are intelligent, with humor and wit.

I am a fan of many British series.  Had to buy a region free DVD player to view Death In Paradise, but the expense was worth it.  Now I can buy more of my favorites that don't play on USA formatted DVD players.",1421107200,4,515,4.543478260869565
