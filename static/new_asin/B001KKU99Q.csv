8315174,5,B001KKU99Q,One of my favorite shows on Animal Planet.,1436572800,,42,4.375
8315175,1,B001KKU99Q,"A total dud! Not as impressive as shown on TV commercial. They show the same thing over and over, when they could have put more content of other interactions of man vs. animal, or animal vs. animal. It reminds me of how on Walker, Texas ranger, how they showed the same fight seen from different camera angles, giving the illusion of more fighting than was actually happening. There also is too much discussion by the narrator, when it is so obvious! It just eats up the time.",1277769600,2,476,4.482758620689655
8315176,3,B001KKU99Q,"This DVD has a total of 4 episodes, approximately 35 minutes each.  Each episode includes 7 different animal attacks (about 5 minutes per animal attack).  However, most of the 5 minutes per animal attack, is repeated information.  It is okay.  You get what you pay for.  Episode #1 includes a cobra attack, spinner shark attack, and a bear getting electrocuted.  Episode #2 includes a great white shark attack, a man getting run over by a mule, and a man getting his head bit by an alligator.  Episode #3 includes a cheetah attach, a wild elephant, and a skiing dog falling down a mountain.  Episode #4 includes an elephant getting electrocuted, a crazy bull, and a baby polar bear caught in a trap.",1256860800,11,699,4.672131147540983
