8199256,5,B000R7HY28,My son and I first saw this computer animated show on a Cable channel. Well we-he enjoyed it so much I decided to buy a few DVD's.  The stories are entertaining and theres actually an educational message to each story so its not wasted time in front of the Tube.,1255132800,,262,4.24
8199257,5,B000R7HY28,My son is 2 1/2 and loves anything related to cars and monster trucks.  Meteor & the Mighty Monster Trucks are his favorite series to watch.  I would highly recommend this series.  Very good show for kids.,1227052800,,205,4.486486486486487

This disc (Vol. 2) includes the following episodes:
* Cheering section
* Tag along
* Trucktacular truckathon
* Rebel rover
* Hang time
* Bathtime for Junkboy",1213660800,3,429,4.706666666666667
8199259,5,B000R7HY28,"My little boy loves this show on Discovery Kids. It shows kid monster trucks getting into trouble and learning life lessons. This is the only cartoon he watches. He also loves the music when the show comes on. This is a great DVD for little boys. My daughters like it too. But, are not that intrested in it as he is.",1210982400,,316,4.19672131147541
8199260,4,B000R7HY28,"My 3 year old son is crazy over Meteor and the Mighty Monster Trucks.  I find myself engrossed in the cartoons over and over.  We watch at least one episode every night and he spends hours pretending his toy trucks are Meteor, L.T., and the rest of the gang.  The videos are, as I said, entertaining and deliver positive messages.  Each video (volumes 1 and 2) contains six 10 minute episodes.  This volume has ""Cheering Section"" where kids learn the importance of being a good sport, ""Tag Along"" where L.T. has to spend time with his sister, Zooey, who spends the day copying him.  He learns that imitation is the best form of flattery.  ""Trucktacular Truckathon"" illustrates the importance of teamwork even if your ""team"" isn't what you expected.  In ""Rebel Rover"" Meteor rebels when he is called the teacher's pet and discovers not all attention is positive.  By breaking the rules and breaking into the junkyard in ""Hang Time"", the gang finds out that part of being a ""big truck"" is understanding the importance of rules.  And in my personal favorite, ""Bathtime for Junkboy"", Junkboy overcomes his fear of bathing and finds out it's not so bad after all.",1208131200,,1158,4.745
8199261,5,B000R7HY28,"My son recently discovered this show on TV, and he loves it so much that I bought the first two volumes on DVD so he could watch it on the car DVD player. This show never gets old to him! He loves it. And it's actually one of the few cartoons that I can stand to watch! Funny, great graphics, and very cute!!",1204848000,,308,3.9047619047619047
