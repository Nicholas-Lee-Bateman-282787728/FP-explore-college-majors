8165659,4,B000M27BFI,"This is a film with many fun ingredients.  A down on his luck-no talent magician, an alcoholic clown, a reforming hooker and a two bit dealer trying to make a big score.  It takes some edgy twists and turns and is pretty satisfying.  Production value is uneven, but the film holds together well.
