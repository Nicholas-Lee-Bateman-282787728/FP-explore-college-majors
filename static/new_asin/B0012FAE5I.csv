8619265,2,B0012FAE5I,"This DVD is a simple photo slideshow and nothing more. If you just want pretty pictures in the background on your TV then this will do it -- the photos do show some nice sights of New Zeland, but there is not text captioning to tell you where on the island the images are from, and no additional tidbits of information that might be interesting. We were disappointed with it because we were looking to know more. We saw nice photos but had no idea where on the island the image came from, so it was pointless for us learning anything about New Zealand or figuring out what to go see on our trip there.",1258329600,2,601,4.234782608695652
