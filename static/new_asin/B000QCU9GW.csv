8195686,1,B000QCU9GW,"""Ghost Gate"" commits the unforgivable sin of a foreign-language DVD; There is no original language track.  There is absolutely no reason for a DVD to be produced that doesn't contain a subtitle track along with the original voice track, in this case Japanese.  On that basis alone, this is a one-star DVD.

This film is the first in a six-part series called ""Series Kyofu Yawa"" (""Series Horror Night Tale"") that includes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Demon-Hunting/dp/B000QCU9H6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Demon Hunting</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Coffin/dp/B000SSQ7LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Coffin</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legend-of-Ogre/dp/B000VSDNEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legend of Ogre</a>,  Melocholia and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Site/dp/B000SSQ7LU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Site</a>.  Fortunately, I think ""Ghost Gate"" is the only one in the series to not come with a Japanese-language track, and the remainder probably do not have that problem.  The films are all fairly amateur, filmed on video and utilizing a cast with few if any professional credits.  One gets the sense that they are largely the director and his friends getting together to make a movie.  There is nothing wrong with that, and the results can be a lot of fun to watch.  I really enjoyed ""Legend of Ogre"", and the others I have seen in the series are worth a watch.

""Ghost Gate"" director Yamaguchi Makoto is also not exactly a skilled professional, and his only non-amateur credit is the ill-received TV series ""Kyofu Gakuen"" or ""Frightful School"".  Still, he obviously has a passion for horror and makes good use of limited special effects.  Unfortunately, his lack of skill shows as boom mikes and crew-member limbs pop up from time to time taking you right out of the scene.

The story has a group of students spending a weekend in an ancient castle to investigate a murder, for which a 50,000,000 yen reward has been posted. The group fancies themselves as amateur ghost hunters, and this is not their first foray into the spooky unknown.  Inside, they find a cellphone with pictures of people getting murdered by a mysterious ghost figure in the background.  The group tries to make a speedy exit, but the castle door snaps shut, trapping them inside and the game is on.

I have to say that this was the worst of the ""Series Kyofu Yawa"", not only for the bad dubbing but the movie as a whole.  Like the rest of the series, there are a few Japanese bikini models making appearances, in this case Yabe Miho being the main attraction.  But looking good in a bikini doesn't make you a good actress, and she keeps all of her clothes firmly on.  There really isn't too much here to recommend, and getting one of Miho's photobooks would be a better use of your money. Definitely one to miss.",1232841600,2,3001,5.688340807174888
