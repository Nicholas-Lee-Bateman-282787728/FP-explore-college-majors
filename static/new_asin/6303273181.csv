7842351,4,6303273181,"First of all,I know I was suppose to review TNA Bound For Glory 2011 but they don't have it out yet. Im sorry but here something that I use to rent from Wherehouse(FYI) back when I was young:WCW Halloween Havoc 1994. The TV title match between Johnny B. Badd & The Honky Tonk Man had pretty good wrestling and could have done better without the 10 minute time limit which cause the bout to end in a draw. The World Tag Team title match between Pretty Wonderful(Paul Orndorff & Paul Roma) & Stars ""N"" Strips(The Patriot & Marcus Alexander Bagwell) also had pretty good wrestling and much better then the Sin Cara Blue-Sin Cara Black match from the last wrestling PPV I reviewed:Hell In a Cell 2011. The Kevin Sullivan-Dave Sullivan match was stupid but a fun kind of stupid. The Arn Anderson-Dustin Rhodes match was a basic brawl but nothing really note wrothy. The United States title match between ""Stunning"" Steve Austin & Jim Duggan was surprisely a pretty good,back-and-forth & entertaining bout and could have done better if Austin didn't stupidly toss Duggan over the top rope causing Steve to get DQed. The match between Vader & The Guardian Angel was pretty much a big man brawl but still a good bout with alot of smash-mouth moves. The tag team bout between The Nasty Boys(Brain Knobbs & Jerry Sags) & the team of Terry Funk & Bunkhouse Buck was a entertaining brawl to say the least. The Career vs. Career/Steel Cage match for World Heavyweight title between Hulk Hogan & Ric Flair was also a entertaining brawl and everyone who saw this at least had a good time watching it. I give this event a 8 out of 10.",1318723200,,1618,4.563573883161512
