1877958,4,B000093NPS,"I was quite surprised at just how dark and gloomy You're Under Arrest!: The Motion Picture is compared with the upbeat and funny situations of the OAV series and the Specials that I had seen from the series previously.  While ""purists"" of the series will likely balk at the dark overtones (which are highly prevalent even in the scenes which take place in broad daylight), all the ""negativity"" and the terrorizing of Tokyo actually works quite well, with the series' penchant for comedy coming through at just the right moments for brief levity.
Overall, the storyline is excellent.  Mystery, drama, and action are all interwoven into a beautiful narrative which is absolutely enthralling.  Yet while prior knowledge of the You're Under Arrest! series would certainly be beneficial for the viewer, such familiarity with the series is definitely not needed... although the viewer may then wonder about why certain over-the-top feats take place in various scenes.
Where the film fails greatly, however, is in the occasional use of freeze-frames in key, high-action moments.  Given that non-theatrical anime is typically produced under a very stringent time schedule and with a sub-par budget, cost-cutting tactics such as reusing scenes (such as the transformation scenes in any magical girl anime) or using freeze-frames to cut down on the number of animation cels (and the time to create them) is not surprising.  But for a theatrical-release anime which inherently receives a higher budget and (at least in theory) more time for production to achieve the higher level of quality viewers expect in a theatrical release, the use of freeze-frames is this film's major pitfall.  The freeze-frame concept works well for comedy, such as A-ko jumping from missile to missing in Project A-ko; the freeze-frame concept to highlight a high-action/high-drama moment fails miserably, at least in this film.
The freeze-frame fiasco aside, You're Under Arrest!: The Motion Picture is definitely not the stereotypical anime offering available in the States.  Although this is really not meant for young children, they could probably enjoy this as well.  While female characters are VERY prominent in the film, they are not super-endowed or fetishized or denigrated in any way.  Nothing is gratuitous in this film, although some of the action is definitely over-the-top.  And perhaps most importantly, the flow of the film is so natural and engrossing that it almost feels ""real..."" at least, until a freeze-frame occurs.  Overall, this is a definite must-see film for any anime enthusiast, and a good place to start for those wishing to learn about anime.",1064016000,5,2641,5.234597156398104
7988975,5,B000093NPS,Fun show reading subtitles can take away from viewing. I like to listen to Japanese language while watching anyway ,1496361600,,115,5.052631578947368
7988976,5,B000093NPS,Good anime film.  There's plot and good storytelling through the characters.,1473552000,,76,5.909090909090909
7988977,4,B000093NPS,I really like this movie but every time I see it I find a surprise how gloomy it is compared to the slapstick style comedy of the OAV and TV series.  The team is brought back together after a year apart and things are not well.  The police station is started to stock pile weapons  taken by terrorists and found in abandoned vechiles. not to mention city bombings.  The station chief is locked up as a suspected as the movie builds up for an all out assault on the station in a way that remind me of Assault on Precinct 13 movie.  If you like a good mystery you'll like trying to figure out along with the cops who the mastermind behind all the clues the cops keep collecting and what his master plan truly is.,1389830400,,710,4.1911764705882355
7988978,5,B000093NPS,"This is the first, and to my knowledge only, feature length entry in the You're Under Arrest anime franchise, based on the long running manga series by Kousuke Fujishima (the renowned creator of Ah! My Goddess), which includes the original 4-episode OVA series, a three season TV show (the first season led off by the OVAs, to the disgruntlement of those who purchased the videos) and 21 OVA specials (20 'minis' divvied into 5 episodes, and one full length episode that was aired at the end of TV season 1) that place the emphasis on naughty humor and fanservice (particularly the full length final, Diverting Traffic at the Beach, one of the most swimsuity, and occasionally nonswimsuity, swimsuit episodes ever, a must for anyone who's always wanted to see our heroines out of uniform, though of course there's that shot of Natsumi in a tank top and Tbakku in the opening of OVA episode 2--ahem!)
Anyway, for those unfamiliar with, all of these (and the 9-episode live action TV 'drama') center on two Tokyo police women (of the young and cute variety naturally; of course the live action ladies aren't nearly as, um, 3-dimensional shall we say, as their anime counterparts); brass, outspoken 'motor head' Natsumi Tsujimoto and the demure, more thoughtful but equally head strong 'techie' Miyumi Kobayakawa, who serve together, in their trademark hopped up VW 'Minipat', as traffic officers at the fictional Bokuto Precinct in (non-fictional) Sumida (in place of the real life Bokuto Hospital, the model for the station house).
The large supporting cast notably includes their long suffering Chief (his name, Kochou, isn't mentioned til the 2nd season of the TV series), ditzy gossip Yoriko Nikaido (initially a dispatcher, she becomes a patrol officer in the TV series), motorcycle patrol leader Ken Nakajima, the self-styled White Hawk of Bokuto, whose 'secret' yen for Miyuki is a widely open one (and whose resemblance to Lt. Howard Hunter of Hill Street Blues, played by James B. Sikking, is surely no coincidence), and as of the TV show, the gorgeous Aoi Futuba who, to the guys' chagrin and the girls' delight, turns out to be a male officer unable to give up the female guise, and personality, he employed for years as an undercover vice detective.
The film version presents an atypically serious story, with similarities to the first two Patlabor movies, including a great score by Kenji Kawai,
And that's about enough said about it, yeah?
Unfortunately this release, from ADV Films, is out of print, along with their Mini Specials volume, as ADV folded back in 2008 or 9, but both may be available from their most prominent 'reincarnation', Sentai Filmworks, who released all three TV seasons, or re-released in the case of season 1, which was initially licensed here, along with the original OVA 'singles', by AnimEigo (they went out of the anime production biz a few years back, but all but TV vols. 10 & 11 can be had from their website for a very nice price).
Of course you can also shop for YUA on Amazon.
And that's that, I guess; think I'll go watch Diverting Traffic at the Beach again--just for the swimming safety tips of course.",1385337600,,3152,4.893457943925234
7988979,3,B000093NPS,"A little action, a little comedy, a little drama, and a solid story wrapped up in some very fine animation makes ""You're Under Arrest: The Movie"" enticing to watch and own. Though more serious with an overall darker tone as compared to the light-hearted tv series, the movie paces itself with the antics of the police partner duo Miyuki and Natsumi yet stays like that at best.

The crisp animation of the actions sequences and theatrical aura will give viewers a ride for their money but the abrupt red lights in the form of brow-raising still frames leave goers bewildered and dazed. Though sparce and lasting only a second or two, they appear in the midst of heated action sequences and temporarily suspend you in your seat and cut off interest until the moment passes.

The storyline itself is intriguing and pushes the series towards an interesting direction. However, the 90mins doesn't allow for the story to develop much and sink in. Things often seem too rushed and the end leaves a bitter sweet satisfaction.

In terms of audio, the 5.1 Surround Sound makes listening a breeze.

Good not great. The movie has great potential but doesn't bring in the thrill viewers are accustomed to watching from the series. Overall, it's still worth having and you'll find yourself eyeing it once in a while.",1198800000,3,1303,4.803571428571429
7988980,5,B000093NPS,"In the YUA movie, it's important to consider it's release some time after--long after--both seasons of the television show and the original OVA. It's fairly apparent that the creators made an effort to broaden it's appeal from something of a niche market for tech-heavy, light fanservice comedies, turning out what is far more seriously-minded than any of the previous material.

That being said, it's very entertaining, with animation that's superb compared to the rather visually-disappointing first and second seasons of the TV series, with good voice acting and a steady pace of plot. This isn't a cliched shoot-'em-up cop movie--if you want to see people die horribly in gunfights, you're not going to like this (or the rest of YUA, for that matter). In this regard, it does stay true to the material, though it's not the same slice-of-life sort of script that defined the show. However, even if you're not a YUA fan, so long as you're patient and willing to pay attention to detail and a complex plot, you should enjoy this. Not for lazy watchers.

An additional note--I based this review on the 'remastered' version--distinguished by its later release and black and blue DVD (rather than red and orange) case art. The video transfer is noticeably better on this version, so if you have a choice, definitely grab the later.",1179100800,3,1329,4.955156950672646
7988981,5,B000093NPS,"This is good! I liked what I've seen of the original series and the movie didn't let me down. The characters are the best thing about YUA (I love the Chief, Yoriko, Aoi, and Nakajima Ken)!, and we get a chance to see some different sides to them in the movie. It's way more serious than the series, but still very funny, and it's something I can watch with my kids without feeling dumbed-down or bored out of my mind.",1130889600,,417,4.225
7988982,2,B000093NPS,"Do not buy this letterboxed crap that looks absolutely horrendous. It sets an example of what not to put on a DVD. ADV will be releasing a special edition on 9/27/2005 that features a brand new, anamorphic transfer and 5.1 audio.",1118620800,3,229,4.609756097560975
7988983,1,B000093NPS,"Whatever you do, don't buy this copy of the YUA movie.  ADV acquired the masters to this and then sat on it for so long that they released a VHS-quality version on DVD: non-anamorphic; missing the 5.1 audio; and from the look of it made from a composite (TV) master.

Fortunately ADV are re-releasing it in February 2005 as it should have been the first time around.  Get that version instead.  Do not support this crappy release by buying it.",1104364800,5,443,4.5
7988984,2,B000093NPS,"As usual, the powerful female figures on the front of the DVD got to me.  First, I watched all of the OVAs.  They disappointed me so bad I ended up sellign the whole tape.  Then I bought the manga, and I thought it was decent. Then comes the movie.  I will agree that the animation was excellent and the effects they used were amazing, but the content of all of it suffered.  I'm going to give the series one last chance: I'll soon buy the mini-specials.  Get Dirty Pair: Project Eden instead.",1069200000,,493,4.304347826086956
