1085335,4,6305821550,"- This only gets 4 stars due to the fact that there's only 3 episodes on the disc, rather than 4 episodes that most series have. ... - As for the stories, there's no question that Vash is a hero, but with much of his past still shrouded in secret, how much can he be trusted? The first episode puts this to the test as Vash takes on a contract to kill. Can his friends stop him in time? - With the introduction of Legato, the series takes a darker turn as we see a side of Vash that he hasn't shown before. The episode hints at a past relationship between the two and it appears as if they were either friends or allies. - The last episode indeed is a recap of the series, but after the excitement of the previous episode, it does give viewers a chance to wind down and toward the end, Vash again heads out of town, followed by our intrepid insurance agents. - Definitely recommended for fans of the series and for people who've been reluctant to make a buy.",970704000,,958,4.155913978494624
1085336,5,6305821550,"Um...wow.
This DVD has succeeded in completely flooring me. I have watched it 12 times since getting it 5 days ago, and I still can't get enough.
For a recap: Vash is not to be messed with. In this DVD we have the introduction of Legato Bluesummers and the Gung-ho Guns. These are the first real villians in the series, and they truly are worthy of it. Legato is purely psychopathically EVIL. He has no consideration for human life, and is probably the second best villian of all time in anime (in my opinion). This DVD starts off Triguns serious phase, a phase which I believe will last to the end. This shows Vash's truly bitter and angry side, and I won't spoil the surprises also shown in this dvd...
The Music: Ok, the music is truly trippy. The scene where Legato and Vash meet has the most eccentric score I have ever heard. I have always enjoyed the music, but it just has gotten better (and wierder too).
The bad: Ok, the animation quality seems to be going slightly downhill. Only slightly, mind you, yet downhill nonetheless (in my opinion). I am hoping that this is only a phase, a point where they are saving the budget for later shows or some other logical reason. But this is all subjective in opinion anyways.
The DVD itself: I continue to be dissapointed in the companies which remaster the english soundtracks, yet fail to do so with the Japanese tracks. My stereo setup has the frequent habit of showing up every shortcoming in a soundtrack, and the detail which is brought out in the english track is forgotten sometimes in the Japanese. Ho-hum. I guess I am one of the few who watches with subtitles anyways.
The picture is also excellent (well above par for a lot of anime series). The menu screens continue to amaze me as well (go pioneer! way to use the looping animations!).
So to finish this all off, I highly recommend this DVD, for both picture and plot. Get it if you can!",970704000,3,1901,4.481268011527377
1085337,5,6305821550,"I kinda liked the first trigun disc, thought some may not have. I enjoyed the second one more than the first, and some of those who didn't like the first would jump on the band wagon. I loved the third disc with the introduction of Wolfwood, and by the time you see the third disc you would have to like it. But then I ordered the fourth disc [from] suncoast and got it ten days in advance and was so amazed at the episodes. The last episode on the disc is mostly a through away which just reviews the previous episodes from 1 and up. But the first two are the best episodes i have seen so far. And they finally introduce some worthwhile villans like legato bluesummers. Legato is in it momentarilly but you can see a future for him he just comes off as EVIL. If you see this one you are gonna want to buy them all. The series just gets better with ever release. Trigun is one of the best animes i have seen in a while. It's true It's True, This is right up there near the top of the list of the best anime series of all time.",969408000,9,1026,4.034313725490196
7897039,5,6305821550,"Vash the Stampede, the spikey haired antihero of the Trigun series again blazes his way through the landscape with typical destruction and good humor.

Escape From Pain- Vash and Wolfwood again team up in an attempt to help a young couple elope. In a more serious tone than he normally has, Vash sets off after the couple in what seems like an attempt to take them back to where they came from. The ending includes the parting of ways from Wolfwood, the enigmatic priest.

Diablo- The past again comes back to haunt Vash as a huge man searches for Vash to kill him, destroying part of a town in the process, something that sets off Vash into his most serious and deadly visage that we ever see. Vash truly does seem to turn into ""Diablo"" as he tries to protect himself and avenge the town. This is also the first introduction of Legato Bluesummers, possibly the most intelligent and malicious character Vash ever faces in the entire series. Legato is the bain of Vash's existance and continues to be through the rest of the series in his subversive, manipulative way.

Vash the Stampede- Faced with the choice between killing and peace Vash chooses the latter again, though not without a struggle. In a truly heart breaking scene, Vash cries out to the lost Rem, the woman who only appears in Vash's memories, to help him chose which way to go. Milly and Meryl and faced with the enigma that is Vash. One minute he's a likable, sweet natured goof ball, the other he has the eyes of the devil. As they contemplate their adventures with him, they try to come to terms with who he is. The episode ends with them walking in on him and seeing the mass of scars his upper body is as he refuses to kill his enemies and has taken the punishment for that. This episode starts the more serious tone that the rest of the series takes.

Again, Vash is endearing if an enigma. He seems to be haunted terribly by his past, yet has a kind heart and sweet spirit in spite of that.",1099008000,,1964,4.43213296398892
7897040,4,6305821550,"This particular DVD marks the beginning of the true plotline in the series.  These three episodes are the deepest thus far and each one serves a purpose to the overall series.  The first, ""Escape from Pain"", may seem like the adventures Vash and the other main characters have gone through before but this episode is deep in that it reveals the philosophical differences between Vash and Wolfwood.  In effect, the two of them have very different ways of solving their problems and this episode highlights what will become one of the chief questions that arise in the series.
The next episode, ""Diablo"", is a complete departure from the earlier part of the series.  Here the plot begins as a man tells Vash that he is going to die.  This man is not interested in the massive reward or even revenge.  I will not reveal any of his motives here however.  This episode shows the serious side of the series and also the dilemmas of some of its main characters.  This is the first time you may feel more emotionally drawn into Trigun and if you have been already, get ready for quite a trip.
The final episode, ""Vash the Stampede"", is mostly just a recap episode (explaining the four stars).  As boring as it may be it does help string all the parts of the series thus far together and may get you to think in some ways you haven't before.  There is also a bit of plot revealed as we determine a bit more of Vash's character so overall it is worth it to watch this episode.
Mostly I have to say that I am almost as impressed with this DVD as I am with the others.  The final episode leaves a bit to be desired but overall even that episode can be helpful.  The first two episodes only scratch the surface of the overall effectiveness of Trigun and hopefully will leave you obsessively saving money to get the next DVD.  In all reality, Trigun is a discovery of many different things about what one should and shouldn't do.  This DVD really illustrates that point very well.  I hope you find this to be well worth your money.  This series is truly one of the greatest out there and even with the recap episode this DVD beats the vast majority of other movies in existence.",1088899200,2,2164,4.4267676767676765
7897041,5,6305821550,"As the series becomes more complex, the characters grow into people you can start to relate too. As for Vash, he proves to himself that death, although tempting, is not the way to release pain, no matter how great. In these episodes, you will see the man Vash truly is, you will see his life in a new prespective, and you will fall more in love with the foolish Vash that we have come so far with.",1068681600,,397,4.1688311688311686
7897042,4,6305821550,We now see a little more about Vash. We get to see what is under that coat and special gadets he has. Also we see a dark side. I guess you would say. His eyes glow a couple of times. Hopely the Vash we know and love will not change in the up and coming volumes. I haven't seen them yet but I can't wait. Love and Peace.,1040774400,,319,3.7058823529411766
7897043,5,6305821550,"Well, well, well, where do I begin? Lets start with the obvious, this DVD rocks. Period. This (very fine) collection of episodes are the first to really pick up on Vash and his real personality. Is he really the kind-hearted goof we all know? Or is he really the heartless killer that everyone seems to think he is? This DVD leaves you with so many questions unanswered, that its virtually impossible not to buy the next DVD in the series. Vash gets truly angry in this DVD... Something that I've been waiting for. Up until now, he's always put his enemies out with their own weapons, or fooled them somehow... In this DVD he shoots directly at his enemy in a fit of rage (This scene alone puts any action scene I've ever seen to shame). Legato is the perfect villian, even his presence gives you chills. I can't say much about plot withought giving anything away, but the fact is, this DVD should be in your library. No question about it.",995760000,,939,4.465116279069767
7897044,5,6305821550,"This is a great anime series.  It's a must watch if you are any fan of sci-fi.  Or even if you want something to enjoy that's not etremely violent but nice and calm.  The character development is very well plotted and this series has a great comedy side to it.  Your main character is a dimwit in disguise, somewhat like Kenshin.  So all those who are iffy about this series...I say jump and go for it.  What's the worse that could happen...you could regret buying.  HAHAHAHA!!! No!  This is an amazing series and worth at least every dollar of it.  If you think on buying VHS and don't know wether dubs or subs.  I say the dubs aren't half bad at all...and the subs are about as equal to the dubs.  It's your choice.  A must watch anime!!! ^_^'''",991699200,,747,4.294964028776978
7897045,4,6305821550,"The series takes a turn in this volume.  Not until the second episode however.
The first episode fits in more with the ""Wolfwood"" DVD.  But the second episode starts off the series major story arc between Vash, the Gung-Ho Guns, and Legato.
The first episode is funny.  The second episode is more violent than most Trigun episodes and more action packed.  But the third episode is kind of a disappointing filler episode.  It basically sums up the previous episodes for those who may have missed them.  However you do get to see Vash shirtless and that is a pretty big revelation.
I miss most of the lightheartedness of the previous episodes, but this DVD is a must-have.  And the story only gets more interesting as you go on from here.",987897600,,736,4.615384615384615
7897046,5,6305821550,"This DVD has one of the creepiest villains yet to come out of an anime.  The first confrontation that Vash has with him is the most original I have seen yet.  I don't want to ruin anything for you, but rather keep you in suspense.  Vash is literally driven insane in this DVD and is much more serious than comedic for a change, which IS a good thing.  It is sad to see Wolfwood depart from Vash at the end of the discs first episode, but something tells me that is not the last of him we will see.  Anyway, definitely pick this up; you are in for quite an experience!  DON'T MISS OUT!!",982540800,3,585,4.087719298245614
7897047,5,6305821550,"first of all.  hee hee hee.  people have really been saying how good Legato is and the Big gunned guy and Vash.  Lets start at the beginning.
Wolfwood.  You so get a new depth to his character in the first episode.  You see his serious side more and his umm umm umm  <snap>  y'know hesitations.  good word yep yeps.
Second episode its all about Vash and Legato.  Oh dear... Legato's a complete psychopath.  o.o  And with his semi-minor semi-major roll in the episode, WOW!  Keep an eye on him, he's *the* villian.  And that other big guy... whatever, he's good for tipping Vash the wrong way.  Vash gets mad boys and girls, he gets angry.  An Angry Vash is a Scary Vash.
And the third episode, people keep saying ""recap recap"".  blah blah blah.  It ends the cliffhanger for Mr. Angry Vash.  And above all really gives a look at Meryl and her general feelings towards Vash.  A filler episode if anything else, but don't think it doesn't add anything.  Its still good.
Menu's rock.  No Video problems that I could see.  Audio kicks (actually a series where I can semi-tolerate the dubbing).  I didn't notice a downside to the animation at all which a past review mentions but whatever.
Thats my take. p;xl'z out",971308800,2,1209,4.52093023255814
7897048,4,6305821550,"Vash The Sampede without a doubt is one of the most mysterious anime characters out  there, and with the fourth installment of Trigun, that mystery only becomes more indepth. Vash shows a side that he's never shown before, and also shows  just what the price of sparing your enimies lives can cost. If you've seen the previous TRIGUN epidoes, than you'll definately appreciate what Gun-Ho-Guns has to offer. With the introduction of new enemies that have their eyes set on Vash. Trigun is the only western/sci-fi anime that I've ever seen work so well. So if you haven't seen TRIGUN before, try it out, you won't be dissappointed.",970876800,3,630,4.824074074074074
