I am hard to please when it comes down to viewing deep subjects, but I was surprised just how good this movie was.  I feel it gives a realistic look into the lives of those addicted to and affected by heroin.

The acting is so-so but I feel if other actors were used, the movie may not have been so real to life.",1178841600,,460,4.032967032967033
1890456,4,B00009RGB9,"While this film fictionalizes the account of the drug deaths in Plano, you can hear the ring of real voices inside the monologue.  There is no romanticizing the use of heroin, the kids use simply because they want to use, and it there for them.  Without comedy, exaggeration, or inflated drama, 'Wasted' simply tells the story of one girl's relationship with heroin and how it almost killed her.

Nick Stahl, Summer Phoenix, and Aaron Paul play their roles expertly and believably as Chris, Samantha, and Owen, respectively.  I'm a fan of Nick Stahl anyway, part of the reason I rented a MTV produced movie.  The production, photography, and presentation of the movie is better than I thought would come out of MTV also, so give this movie a try by renting and find out for yourself.

Samantha and her lifelong friends Owen and Chris grew up together in Plano, TX, what Samantha calls a ""Pop-Up"" city.  Their parents are all wealthy, and the kids are all bored, waiting to find out which college they will be going to after high school.  So they party and get high.

Samantha overdoses, and Chris, a track star and the only friend who doesn't use heroin, takes Sam to the hospital.  Sam is forced to confront her addiction and attend NA classes.  Owen, Sam's boyfriend who is heavy into using, doesn't want to take her, so Chris drives her to her meetings.  Chris and Samantha develop a stronger relationship while Owen falls away from them, still deeply imbedded in his drug lifestyle.  Regardless of the fact that Sam drops Owen and begins to date Chris, the three are still fast friends.

Sam slips, Chris blows his knee in a track meet and winds out trying heroin, Owen continues to behave like a mess, and meanwhile kids in this pop-up town are dying right and left, from boredom and heroin.

The results are typical, but what makes 'typical' not-clich&eacute; in this movie is that these events are based on the real facts that occurred in Plano, and the narrative based on real kid's voices.  In spite of film's inability to ever reach box-office proportions, I felt that it was well acted, well scripted, realistic, and something I would certainly want my kids to watch.  Definitely worth at least a rental.  Enjoy!",1143590400,6,2223,4.715025906735751
1890457,4,B00009RGB9,"Wastedm, hits home by showing the insanity of heroin use amoung teens.  Heroin use is becoming very prevelent amoung middle class suburbanites, and the movie accuratley depicts the motions of addiction.  It seems that MTV made a movie based on my life.  Furthermore, the movie is a very dramatic, heartfelt peice of art.",1073865600,5,320,5.0
7993001,4,B00009RGB9,"Watched this movie as a young adult on MTV and had to take a nostalgic trip down memory lane so I purchased it. Best for a more mature audience since there is hard drug use shown in the movie. Acting isn't that great, but they are mostly younger kids.",1461456000,,251,4.142857142857143

7993010,5,B00009RGB9,"I remember seeing this by accident years ago and it was so hard to track down a copy! But although I will admit this movie uses very awkward camera angles at times, Aaron Paul plays an awesome antagonist and Nick Stahl a great protagonist! The message in this movie is strong and can definitely help someone on the wrong path. I highly suggest watching it through to the end, its powerful! Summer Phoenix does a great job as well!

As far as shipping and item condition reviews, FAST SHIPPING! No problems, movie came sealed. Would definitely buy from again.",1320451200,,558,4.636363636363637
