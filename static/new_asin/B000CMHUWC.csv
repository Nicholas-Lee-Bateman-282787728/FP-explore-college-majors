8099267,4,B000CMHUWC,It was a pretty good VHS. Sunny was very popular back in the days when this video came out. I would definitely recommend this VHS to any true wrestling fan out there going back to the old days of the 80's and 90's.,1364428800,,214,4.0
8099268,5,B000CMHUWC,"It seems like ages ago and in fact it has been about 9 years, since Sunny (Tammy Sytch) was the hottest thing on the wrestling scene.  She was one of the few wrestling stars who managed to make an impact on the mainstream audience, as she was the most downloaded personality on the web at one point.

This 60 minute tape features Sunny in action during her prime years.  She is seen with the Bodydonnas (featuring her deceased husband Chris Candido), the Godwinns and the Smoking Gunns.  There are also a number of video shoots and music videos featuring Sunny in various skimpy outfits.

Sunny was perhaps the best wrestling diva ever.  It is a shame that she has fallen on hard times in the years since.  This video isn't a hard-hitting look at Sunny, nor does it really bring anything new to the table.  It is what it is, a superficial look at Sunny at her best.  If you are feeling a bit nostalgic for the Sunny days of wrestling, this tape is a sure bet.",1139961600,2,959,4.372881355932203
