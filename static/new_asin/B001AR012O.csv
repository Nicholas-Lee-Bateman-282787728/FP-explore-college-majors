3465448,3,B001AR012O,"The Prince and Me 3 was actually somewhat better than the second one in the series. The major positive difference was that the actor playing the King appeared to actually want to be there. In The Prince and Me 2 it was fairly obvious that Luke Mably did NOT want to be in the film.

The major negative difference was the terrible, awful, worst I have ever seen actor they found to play the Scott character. I can't think of another actor (and here I use the word actor loosely) that came near the swfulness of this guy. Where did they find this guy? He had no sense of the flow of the movie. He most reminded me of someone whose idea of acting was to stand in front of a camera and say his lines.

Without the actor playing Scott this movie would have stood a chance. Not even close to the original Prince and Me with Julia Stiles but still much better than the second one. Kam Heskin was much better in this one and the director paid attention to details unlike number 2.

I still can't recommend it unless you are simply into the series. Fingers crossed and number 4 will be a bit better still.",1235433600,12,1096,4.23444976076555

3465451,3,B001AR012O,"I purchased this item for a friend who was a massive fan of the first 2 DVDs in this series. Unfortunately, neither of us liked the third installment. I really hope they don't make anymore because it seems they got worse as they went along. The first movie was fantastic and the second was a 'typical sequel' which didn't quite live up to the first's reputation but was still enjoyable. Now, the third movie is almost a complete flop. The scenery is great, so that's one good thing. The acting is believable so that's good too. But the switch in actors throughout the movies brings a noticable change in acting styles. I guess the biggest problem is that I'm comparing this to the first one with Julia Stiles which I really enjoyed. Maybe this movie would appeal to some as a 'stand alone' movie without being compared to the previous ones? If you erase the movie's history, you may well find this a delightful movie!",1228435200,22,917,4.5636363636363635

The film also had a good environmental message against cutting down trees - I think this would be a great movie for the whole family.

And I really liked seeing what happens next to the characters in Prince and Me - A real life fairy-tale!",1225324800,4,361,4.142857142857143
3465456,3,B001AR012O,"It has a real Archie and Jug head type feel to it!
The third in line of a film that probably should have died before the first one:
 a lady doctor marries the king of Denmark.
The characters all have names out of Shakespeare's Hamlet
and the acting makes you home sick for that tragedy!
It is a relatively innocent comedy, but it will bore most parents blind.
Your 8 year old might like it. Cinderella, the continuing story,
again and again and again...?",1217116800,4,454,4.404761904761905

3465589,2,B001AR012O,"I am very glad to see clean, family friendly movies being made.  This movie fits that description.  Unfortunately, it was so boring and/or cheesy, that no one in my family wanted to see it.  The story line was OK, but predictable; the villains were melodramatically over-villainous; the couple kissed or held hands every time they got together to remind us this was a fairy-tale romance; and some of the scenery was obviously low budget.  There were parts that were definitely good, but they were overshadowed by the overall feel of the movie.  It could have been quite a bit better.",1309564800,,583,4.79

3465591,4,B001AR012O,I thought this movie was pretty good! I just had one problem i could not play the DVD in my DVD Player. I ended up playing it in my computer. I wish i know how to fix that any Ideas?,1298160000,,182,3.575
3465592,1,B001AR012O,Bought it as a gift. I did watch it. It's super corny. But if your a tween girl. You'll probably enjoy it.,1290470400,,106,3.8636363636363638
3465593,1,B001AR012O,Why do they keep making movies that don't need a sequel?  The first movie was a cute romantic comedy and left viewers to use their imagination as to what might happen later.  They then made the second one and it has different actors and is not at all as expected.  Paige went home to finish her studies so why is she suddenly studying in a different county?  Why has so many of the actors changed (because they had sense enough to realize this was a stupid movie) and why does Paige still want this guy when he so quickly decides to marry the other girl just because she hasn't learned the language?  (I know it was only suppose to be a few years later but her parents really changed - older actors who were overweight from the younger trim farmers in the first movie)  I actally watched the second movie even though I didn't like it and decided to give this one a try.  I have to be honest and say that I have never sat through this complete movie at one time.  I fall asleep or just give up and walk out of the room.  Bravo to the first actress who never came back for more.,1283299200,,1076,4.159420289855072
3465594,4,B001AR012O,While I prefer Kam Heskin as Queen Paige over Julia Stiles I do miss Luke Mabley as Prince Edward though Chris Geere is a good look a like I thought this movie was every bit as good as the first two. While I did miss having some of the other members of the royal family from the first two movie in the film they were of course not needed for a honeymoon storyline. In this tale the new king switch plans on honeymoon locations at the last moment to surprise his queen. They both get a surprise when they learn the prime minister plans to destory the natural enviroment and wildlife of the area for his own industrial plans. What more one of Queen Paige's former boy friends shows up with a tell all book in attempt to help the minister in blackmailing the royal couple. What neither expected however was that neither the King and Queen due what's normally expected of a royal couple.  The story has a bit of it all from jealousy to romance and comedy. Even a great sword fight between the king and prime minster.  I have yet to find a movie in this series that i didn't love for one reason or another.,1275696000,3,1101,4.2631578947368425
3465595,5,B001AR012O,"i don't understand why everyone is bashing this movie. it is a sweet tale about true love between two lovers: a king, a some normal chick. it's really great. there are some moments when it was really great. it was really heartfelt, and great, because it was about a battle for her heart between the prince and that other guy. Scott I think. he was great.

on a more serious note, i think this movie is great for the careers of Kam and Chris, because they were great. it shows how great their acting abilities are. some of the other British folk were great also in terms of acting. i thought the sword fight was great too. it was pretty great and awesome, almost to the degree of the pirates of the caribbean movies. the part with the snow mobiles was pretty awesome and great too. i thought it was cool how they used them. i had a pretty great experience with that scene. that great scene.

this might not be for people who are haters of great movies. however, if you're just sitting around one night, and you wana have a great time, watch this movie. it really is great. i'm not kidding.

just please watch it. i'm serious.",1275091200,,1124,4.3428571428571425
3465596,1,B001AR012O,"This third  installment of 'The Prince and Me"" trilogy is truly mind-numbing. The first was corny and improbable but had a certain escapist charm owing to the lead actors, Julia Stiles and Luke Mably.  Number two was a hoot; so stupid it left one gasping for air.  Number three has arrived and is giving its immediate predecessor a run for it's money. The main characters have now both been replaced, which is merciful for the reputations of the original cast members; the performances of the new 'royal couple' should give hope to amateur thespians everywhere but those two should seriously contemplate working at the local mall.  Having said that though - we bought it for a laugh and we aren't disappointed!",1260576000,8,710,4.8429752066115705
3465597,1,B001AR012O,"As one might expect from the series, this movie is a bit corny and the acting isn't great. It seems like soap opera acting, with typecast characters. Neither the king nor the queen exude the charisma one would expect from royalty. Much of the storyline is simply unbelievable (does anybody think the ""evil"" prime minister would really whip out a sword and attack the king?). Furthermore, the film looks like it was made on a budget - rather than showing HD-quality scenes of wildlife with the actors, the movie appears to use older footage of wildlife from documentaries that was simply spliced into the movie (at some points, the lighting and tone of the snow in the wildlife shots are slightly different than the rest of the scenes).

The saving grace for this movie is that it is not entirely predictable and the plot takes some twists and turns (some for the worse). I also appreciated that the king and queen were depicted as having a relatively mature relationship - not dramatically breaking up for a year over a silly miscommunication, as seems so prevalent in romantic comedies (for example, ""Baby on Board""). It will probably be entertaining enough for younger kids, but parents and older children will probably be bored.",1257724800,3,1231,4.834123222748815
