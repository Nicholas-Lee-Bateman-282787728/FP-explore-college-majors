7796833,5,1568124961,This is my favorite firm workout video out of the whole series. It is for the very advanced. I am a runner and this workout really gets my heart rate pumping. I'm a big fan of the firm. I'm not crazy about the new firm videos. Love the old series.,1519257600,,247,3.96
7796834,1,1568124961,Moves way too fast! Like some of the other Firm dvds I found this to move at such a frantic pace that it was a recipe for clumsiness-I don't really understand the 5 star reviews on some of the old Firm dvds-I find them to have too many crazy step changes and are hard to follow without getting frustrated or injured-I would rather sweat with Cathe Friedrich or Jari Love then feel like a dancing Gorilla with The Firm,1438646400,,417,4.291139240506329
7796835,5,1568124961,"I actually now own this one on DVD. The fitness favorites has this one on DVD now, which I have waited for years to come out on DVD!

Out of all three Firm ""Cardios"", this one I always grabbed the most. Probably because the music is catchy and very fun. I also LOVE the Maximum Cardio (lead by Carissa Foster)-that one is also very fun and a bit more longer (or feels longer). I do agree, some of the moves are a bit fast paced, so this being said I strongly advise that only advanced exercisers or higher intermediate exercisers only use this (or beginners do NOT use any weights-and a shorter step box like 4-6 inches ONLY).

The warm up is different because she starts out with 3lb dumbells, which I feel gave me a little bit of a warmup-workout type feel. Not really necessary, but gives a little ""umph"" to your workout.

There is quite a few plyos in this workout, so beginners do not jump too high OR alternate light jacks instead of plyos at first. She starts the real workout using the step, then goes into a lot of high impact jogging, hopping, and plyos. Then the end cardio segment she does some very fun 4 limb cardio (which is my favorite type of cardio). The box climb (at the end of the cardio segment is TOUGH because it seems to last a very long time)-again beginners do NOT use the full 14 inch box. Use at the most-8 inches if possible.

The weighted workout segment isn't too long, but has a little bit more of a short ""total body"" toning part (and moreso than the Maximum Cardio and Super Cardio (aka-Calorie Killer 2 lead by Dale). The ab workout is also more longer and more ""thorough"" than the other 2 cardios from this series.

Overall Grade A and a must have for those who hate boredom-this is def a NON boring workout that just flys so fast due to all the constant changes in this fun little workout. Again, beginners DO skip this until you are more advanced, or use caution for certain box heights and plyos. But overall, you will SEE and GET results with this wonderful workout!

A Quick Breakdown differences between all three of these FIRM ""Cardio"" Workouts:

Maximum Cardio (Carissa Foster)
-Has more ""Ball"" cardio then the other two.
-A more ""medium impact""-not as hard as Cardio Burn (this one), but not as easy as Super Cardio (by Dale).
-A bit more longer cardio than this one and Super Cardio.
-Uses the step box with light dumbells and this the FUNNEST step combination segments than the other two.
-Toning Segment is more ""back/Leg work"" than the other two.
-Shortest ab segment

Super Cardio (Dale B also known as ""Calorie Killer 2"")
-Has a more lower impact (but not low impact, just ""lower"") than this one.
-Less plyos than the other two (but still has some plyos)
-A bit less cardio timeframe it seems than this one and Max Cardio
-Toning Segment is more shoulder/arms work than the other two.
-Uses the short step box only once for a short step segment.
-Ab segment is not as long as this one, but not as short as Max Cardio

Cardio Burn (This one/Tamela Hastie)
-Highest impact compared to Super and Max Cardio
-Much more plyos than the other two
-A bit more ""4 limb"" cardio than the other two
-This one uses the short aerobics step in the very beginning (two small segments), then the rest of the entire aerobics is on the floor-then doing a killer tall box climb segment.
-Longest Ab work compared to the other two.
-A more ""total body"" short toning segment

I'd also put them in these catagories although NONE of them are actually for ""beginners""..just stating what I think personally they are in the range of beginner to advanced:

1. Super Cardio (intermediate)
2. Max Cardio (intermediate/Advanced)
3. Cardio Burn (HIGHER Intermediate/Advanced)",1347408000,3,3695,4.541353383458647
7796836,5,1568124961,"One of my friends borrowed this tape years ago and never returned it.
I was so happy when I saw it on Amazon, I've been looking for it for
quite some time. I lost 30lbs. in 11 months with this Firm Cardio Burn.
Is there a DVD? if so, I would buy 5 as gifts.
Good thing I kept my VHS player :)
If you're into weight lost, you have to get this tape.
The quality of the tape is very good.",1321488000,,385,3.707317073170732
7796837,4,1568124961,"This tape is tough and it burns major calories.  I enjoyed it,but there was a little too much jumping around.  Still, I found that it really works.",1206316800,,147,4.407407407407407
7796838,4,1568124961,"This is a great workout for those who are pressed for time and want to pack a lot of work into a short amount of time.  However, the other reviewers are correct in that the footwork (especially on the lifter) is tricky.  I have quite a few Firm workouts and have not had a previous problem with the choreography, but the speed at which Tamela works did pose a safety issue.  That being said, this is a fun workout and the time goes quickly.  You will need weights, a step (or fanny lifter).  Although she uses a weighted ball, you can make do with a dumbbell.  The first part of this workout (approx. 30 minutes) is all cardio, with the remaining 20 minutes devoted to upper and lower body strength moves, and a short segment on abs.",1168732800,3,733,4.313868613138686
7796839,5,1568124961,This is my favorite of the Firm workouts (except for the old school Body Sculpting Basics with Susan Harris--nothing's better than that!) This is one of the few workouts I can do without getting bored; the time really flies. The cardio and sculpting exercises are really good and you'll definitely be feeling it the next day.,1143676800,,325,4.821428571428571
7796840,5,1568124961,"I have been using the firm videos for sometime and i have to say that this is one tape that really got my attention.  I really love the music and the instructor, i thought, was very modivating to me.  I also like the quick  hi-impact then quickly into a low impact segments to really get your heart  pumping.  I  feel that I do get results with these tapes.......I know that  the next day my legs are feeling the workout.  After i have finished this  workout i feel that i have had a great challenging workout and i have had  this tape for about three weeks now.  I am looking forward to purching the  next cardio that is now unavailable but soon coming.",961372800,10,654,4.270491803278689
7796841,5,1568124961,"Well, this is another good video from  The Firm.  This video has more aerobics than their other videos; some kickboxing and lots of jumping.  It's higher impact than most of their other videos too.  It's varied, to  keep you interested and motivated.  The pace is sometimes a little fast to  follow at first.  The music is better than in their other videos; overall  it's a more modern Firm workout.",945734400,12,399,4.666666666666667
7796842,4,1568124961,"This video is similar to the other Firm videos; it combines aerobics with weight training for best results.  The instructor, Tamela Hastie,  can be sappy at times, saying, ""This is fun"" every few minutes.  However, she is in great shape and will put you to the test.  The workout  includes mostly plyometric jumps, squats, lunges and dips to really work  out your lower half.  Tamela works with weights as well, focusing mainly on  shoulders, back, biceps and triceps.  The video finishes with crunches.  What makes this tape different from others is that she repeats many of  these exercises many times so you really feel the burn.  One drawback, for  now, is that I felt some of the choreography was confusing.  It's not  impossible, so I think it can be mastered after a few viewings.
Overall,  I thought the video did a great job with working the entire body.  You will  need hand weights, a low step and a high step to perform the workout.  The  tape also suggests you use a 2 lb. exercise ball and a 10 lb. barbell,  although alternatives are also suggested such as a canteloupe or hand  weights.
I was glad I purchased the tape because I feel it will  definitely provide a challenge.",945734400,25,1190,4.615384615384615
