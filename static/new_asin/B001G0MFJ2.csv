3590057,5,B001G0MFJ2,I was excited to see show on PRIME. I love this show. The picture quality is great!!! I highly recommend watching this show.,1363219200,,124,4.434782608695652
3590058,5,B001G0MFJ2,Ordered for my sons birthday he is a big fan of the show and we had all the seasons except this one. It came before we expected to. Will order from seller again!,1353888000,,161,3.909090909090909
3590059,5,B001G0MFJ2,"I think it is great, I have the whole series, this final series was the most expensive , but well worth it in my opinion.",1302480000,,121,3.88
3590060,4,B001G0MFJ2,"I have all 4 seasons of this show and all of the episodes were hilarious with the exception of the very last one, which is why I gave it 4 Stars instead of 5. It ended like a Spike Lee movie. Weird.

THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS:

After being forced to repeat the 10th grade for tardiness (who does that?) Chris decides to get his GED. Rochelle opens the results, Chris asks, ""What does it say?"" and that's it. Fade to black. Theme Song. Credits. HUH?

We don't know what happened to Chris. We don't know if the lady Julius loaned $25 to ever paid him back. We don't know why the suspicious looking guy was in the restaurant. And we don't know why such a great show with such excellent writers would end a show with no closure. Were they hoping for a 5th season? Now that would make sense. That's the only sense I can make out of such an awful ending to this amazing show.

I still recommend purchasing it. The rest of the episodes are on point, funny as ever! This is one show that did not lose something over the years. Every season is funny and well worth the purchase. I wish the show could have gone on a few more years so we could see Chris graduating from high school and finally beating up CARUSO!",1300147200,5,1221,4.25
3590061,5,B001G0MFJ2,The product was excellent. It arrived ahead of the dated promised. I would buy similar products,1284249600,,95,5.0
3590062,3,B001G0MFJ2,"The DVDs that work are great. This is a 4 disc set and we had a problem with disk 2 & 4 of our original set. Amazon was wonderful and processed our exchange request. We never received the replacement that was ordered but Amazon was very quick to overnight another replacement which we received. Their return process worked very well. However, I think there may be a production/manufacturing error with disks 2 & 4. Both our original discs 2 & 4 and the replacement discs 2 & 4 had unusual markings and sometimes the video freezes. But we are keeping them anyway.",1273795200,,562,4.519607843137255
3590063,4,B001G0MFJ2,"I guess we're supposed to wikipedia Chris Rock's life and figure out what happened, but the last episode was really weird!  Why did they raise all these issues that went unresolved?  What was with the lady who owed Julius $25, did she pay him back?  What was with the weird guy at the diner bar (I thought he was going to kill Julius)?  Why were they singing that song in the diner?  [Note: apparently this was a Sopranos reference, but it was still weird and unsettling]  Can't we even get one Apollo comedy show so we can see how Chris the kid turned into Chris Rock?

Oh, one other thing about this season is that the racist lady teacher with a case of jungle fever was back (as the principal of his high school), but she's not funny anymore... not that ""funny"" was ever quite the word for it, it was always way too uncomfortable to be quite funny.  The actress just isn't into it anymore, maybe she feels squicky (although why now, after a full 3 seasons, I don't know!), and it's just not funny - in that awful I'm going to hell for laughing way - anymore.  The new history teacher/football coach picks up the slack, but with the jerk maneuver he pulls in the last episode, he went from being my favorite new character to being irrevocably a piss-ant.

Loved the whole show, all 4 seasons of it, and every single episode... until the last one.  Weird how they ended it.

In all though, this show is fantastic and I highly recommend it.",1264809600,,1440,4.37218045112782
3590064,5,B001G0MFJ2,I loved this show and would recommend it to any Chris Rock fan of his work or of the show. it did end way to soon I wish they would have added a few more years to see what else happened. great show and totally recommend this to any fan of his movies or stand up.,1259712000,5,262,3.6964285714285716
3590065,5,B001G0MFJ2,The DVD set came on time and in great shape. Everybody Hates Chris is a hilarious show and I hate that it ended after four seasons. I highly recommend this show to everyone. It is truly amazing!,1258329600,,194,4.27027027027027
3590066,5,B001G0MFJ2,"This is the last and final season of Everybody Hates Chris. I can't believe it's come to a end so fast. This season is funny as ever and still filled with lots of laughs from all the characters. The quality of the episodes are still excellent and presented in widescreen format as the previous seasons were. You get some funny bloopers and gags from the bouns material and behind the scenes of this season episodes. So this show has finally come to a end, but I believe it went out strong and glad to own them all!",1252713600,10,514,4.309278350515464

3590217,5,B001G0MFJ2,"The show is loosely based on Chris Rock's life and experiences growing up in New York during the '80s. There is a lot of subtle humor in this show that helps to engage the viewer. There is very little connection between episodes so, it makes for a nice break break from other drama series that require a lot of time to let the story-line  develop.",1402358400,,347,4.338461538461538
