803023,4,6304154186,"The Mara, a snake-light entity, lives on in Tegan, who it soon has control over.
Overall a good follow-up.  There are some superby eerie scenes in a hall of mirrors, the possessed Tegan's voice is grippingly haunting, and  the demonstration of the darker side of Punch & Judy (Punch beating his  wife in front of grinning youngsters obviously taking all this to heart) is  a nice touch.
The real downer is the ridiculous-looking Mara.  Even more  unconvincing than the model used in 'Kinda', this one is a rubber creation,  complete with wobbling rubber fangs, which bleeds blacmange.  Not a very  satisfactory climax to what is otherwise a good story.",948758400,,652,4.908256880733945
803114,4,6304154186,"Snakedance is a superb sequel to Season 19's Kinda as they land on the planet Manussa after the Mara (who had possessed Tegan before) is trying to seize control again. Their arrival is timed with a key anniversary and an opportunity for the Mara to once again take control.

The script is rich and the concepts are very clever and the story is at times, thought provoking. I like the idea of the Doctor forced to prove himself and him not being taken seriously at all. Particularly as he's arguing for something this society sees as just as a superstition. It's a great reversal and really makes this an engaging story.

The acting is top notch as Janet Fielding turns a brilliant performance as Tegan and Davison's Doctor really comes to life and we even catch a glimpse of how the events of Earthshock have affected him. This also some great and memorable guest performances. While the Mara doesn't look, great, it certainly looks better than in Kinda.

The big downside is the costuming. Nyssa's new outfit was really dreadful with nothing matching. Prince Lon's outfit in Episode 4 is absurd. Plus there's no sense of style among this planet which makes it seem artificial as do some of the sets. Still, if you can get past it, this is actually pretty good.",1422144000,,1261,4.645739910313901

This is his TV debut and I found even at this young age he had great promise to become an outstanding actor.  He is very young and raw here, but this episode interested me in the Dr. Who series which has now run on TV for 50 years.  It amazes me that any series could run that long.  The long line of different ""doctors"" bring an  freshness to the series.  I watched some of the newer episodes and found it interesting, amusing, definitely sci-fi in nature but very different from most sci-fi series and very much worth watching.  This particular episode is worth watching if only for the short-skirted outfit Martin wears later in the episode.  He must have hated it, but I loved watching him not only because he did not show any discomfort in his acting, but just because he is just SO tall and very adorable at this young age.",1389916800,,919,4.396449704142012

The Doctor is convinced that the Mara still has some  control over Tegan from thier time on the planet Devaloka.

803195,4,6304154186,"Snakedance is one of the most cerebral - and consequently one of the best - Doctor Who stories ever produced. Curiously, fans of the show have a tendency to under-value stories like this one, favoring ""action-packed"" or ""scary"" stuff like Earthshock and When a Good Man Goes to War. But, for me, Doctor Who is always at its best when it's being aggressively intelligent. Even now, the BBC can't match Hollywood in terms of action and spectacle; but they can produce good, thoughtful drama like Snakedance, which stands the test of time in every area except production values.

Perhaps the most unusual aspect of this story is that the main antagonist, Lon, is not totally evil as most Doctor Who villains are; he's merely bored and amoral, and so he is easily corrupted by the real villain of the piece, a malevolent psychic entity called the Mara. The Doctor, who is used to fighting more belligerent opponents, has a hard time convincing people that Lon is truly dangerous. Indeed, for most of this story, the Doctor comes across as some ranting doom merchant who is alternatively ignored and locked up by the very people he's trying to help. This makes an interesting - and surprisingly realistic - change of pace from the show's usual formula of making the Doctor powerful and very much in charge.

Christopher Bailey's script is interesting in many other ways, as it touches lightly but intelligently on issues such as religion, family, and our common failure to learn the appropriate lessons from history. Unfortunately, Bailey did not enjoy his experience of writing for Doctor Who (as he explains on one of the DVD special features), and he quit writing both for the show and for television in general; this is a shame, as he is clearly one of the best and smartest writers to take a crack at the series.

Speaking of the DVD, I must reluctantly report that it falls into the ""merely competent"" category. In the UK, Snakedance was released in a combo pack with Bailey's other Doctor Who story, Kinda; and it seems to me that most of the budget for the UK release was lavished on Kinda, which got a more extensive package of special features, and new CGI effects for the snake-like physical manifestation of the Mara. Snakedance, alas, gets saddled with fewer special features and the same old rubbery version of the Mara. I think it's pretty stupid that they put new Mara effects in one story but not the other, but I guess money was a concern. It's just my tough luck that I've always liked Snakedance more than Kinda!

On another slightly disheartening note, the audio commentary by actors Peter Davison, Janet Fielding, and Sarah Sutton is too caustic and negative for my tastes, and also very repetitive of Davison's past commentaries. I know that many fans like his commentaries precisely because they're critical and ""honest,"" but at this point I'm tired of listening to him constantly complain that Doctor Who needed darker lighting and faster pacing. Yeah, yeah, I noticed that the lighting on old BBC productions is bad when I was five years old - talk about something else already! I much prefer the more thoughtful analysis provided on this DVD by Doctor Who fan/writer Robert Shearman, who actually understands the story (unlike Davison and Fielding) and is capable of deconstructing it in a way that interests me. Bizarrely, the best feature on the DVD - a fairly long chat between Shearman and Bailey, covering a range of cool topics - is buried in an Easter Egg, which is well worth hunting down if you actually like the story and want to hear a cogent analysis of it.",1308096000,9,3591,4.768488745980707

The TARDIS makes an unplanned landing on Manussa, where preparations are underway to celebrate the defeat of the Sumaran Empire five centuries earlier. But the ancient evil of the Mara lives on, and Tegan, who has been haunted by disturbing dreams since her time under the Windchimes on Deva Loka, is now a pawn in its plan to re-enter the physical world and subjugate the Manussan people. Only the Doctor can stop the Mara - but first he must convince the authorities that he is not just a deluded fool who believes in children's fairytales.

803197,4,6304154186,"Snakedance is one of my favorite episodes.  What makes it is the acting - the royal family is superb, and Tegan who I usually find annoying is excellently evil.  The plot/concept - a society based around the legends of the Mara - the epitome of what I like about Dr Who, every detail explored.  Quotables - There are some very good lines in this episode excellently delivered. The doctor - struggling to understand how to defeat the Mara - no one suffers as well as Peter Davidson. Of course expect the usual original series problems; slow start and absolutely awful effects, however it is also chilling and very engaging. I highly recommend this.",1264464000,2,647,4.707964601769912
803198,2,6304154186,"Just like the first Mara story, ""Kinda"", this has a very good plot in it. Unfortunately, like ""Kinda"", the story suffers badly from lack of action. Apart from the cliffhanger, part one wasn't that good at all, and part four has a confusing and mediocre ending. Apart from the regulars, the acting was terrible. And the costumes were hideous looking like the ones in ""The Horns of Nimon"". On the plus side, like ""Kinda"", the plot was excellent. There were some eerie and scary parts in this one, all the cliffhangers were great, and Janet Fielding's acting was breath-taking. She does a very good job playing the part of a possessed Tegan. She made my hair stand up. But in all, I would not recommend this one.",1234483200,4,709,4.590551181102362
803199,4,6304154186,"""Where the winds of restlessness blow, where the fires of greed burn, where hatred chills the blood, here in the Great Mind's Eye, here in the depths of the human heart, here is the Mara."" --from the diary of Dojjen.
Much like the later Season 25, Season 20 of Doctor Who had the Doctor confronting villains from his past.  This time, it's a creature that only appeared in the previous season.
Tegan has given the Doctor the coordinates to Manussa, a planet of the Earth Federation that used to be part of the Manussan Empire and the Sumaran Empire--Su-Mara, in other words, empire of the Mara, the serpentine embodiment of evil that possessed Tegan in the Kinda story.  The Doctor's fears that the Mara is back is confirmed, but he fits a device that prevents dreams from occurring in her subconscious.  However, once on Manussa, she gets separated from the Doctor and Nyssa, result being that the Mara gains full control over her.
On Manussa, Lon, the young son of the Federator, is bored with affairs of state and spends his time idling on a sofa or behaving childishly, to the chagrin of his indulgent mother Tanha, who wishes he'd take an interest in his own planet's culture.  Ambril, the Director of Historical Research, a pompous academic type who is enthusiastic about archaeology and history, is respectful to Lon nevertheless.  He isn't bored much longer, as he is summoned by the owner of a hall of mirrors stall sent to fetch him.  There, he meets Tegan, who sports a distinctive snake tattoo on her arm, which he acquires once he makes physical contact with her.  She enlists him to get the Great Crystal, under the custodianship of Ambril.
There is a legend on Manussa, that the Mara was not destroyed but driven to the dark places within, and that it will return in a dream and regain power over humans when the minds meet in the Great Crystal.  Ambril dismisses the legend with contempt.  To him, the Mara was destroyed by the Federation, end of story.  His assistant Chela, isn't as skeptical, and he helps out the Doctor under the nose of his boss.  And the Doctor's suspicions are stirred further when he learns that there is an upcoming ceremony commemorating the quinquecentennial of the Mara's destruction.
Like its predecessor Kinda, Snakedance is studio-bound, but the lively atmosphere of the bazaar and the sight of costumed Manussans serves to fill the screen with movement and colour.
Of the guest stars, John Carson as the pompous scholar Ambril and Colette O'Neil (Tanha) stand out.  Preston Lockwood (Dojjen) doesn't say a word onscreen, but his importance is felt when he is mentioned and his characterization is a credible one as a mystical shaman.
Nyssa's new outfit is alas only seen in this story, as she wears a drab white blouse and blue skirt in her final two stories, but here, the seersucker blouse with a striped multicoloured dress ia a welcome change from her fairy princess-like maroon velvet outfit.
Janet Fielding (Tegan) has more fun being possessed than other companions have in previous stories.  Her harsh grating voice is used to great effect, and her laughter when possessed is a far cry from the Doctor's familiar grumpy sorehead of a companion.  She plays someone divided within herself, pleading for help one moment, the next moment speaking harshly.  One of her better moments.
Lots of Buddhist and Native American religion come into play in this sequel to Kinda, and while not reaching the heights of its predecessor, Snakedance succeeds in presenting the material inspired by it in a more easily understood fashion than Kinda.",1076976000,6,3586,4.846153846153846
803200,4,6304154186,"Snakedance is a tremendously strong outing for the Doctor and is highly recommended. The guest cast is superb, Martin Clunes is first class and the absence of Adric gives the Doctor and the companions more to do. Tegan takes center stage and Peter Davison as the Doctor is at his breatlessly, urgent best. The story is a simple exploration of the power of myths in society and how they can be easily exploited, good Dr. Who territory and with a 'monster' thrown in to boot.
