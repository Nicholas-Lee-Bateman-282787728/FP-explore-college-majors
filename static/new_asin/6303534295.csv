7849392,2,6303534295,"In one of the most confused JAWS rip-off of all time, the devil assumes the body of an escaped King Cobra and commands the local serpents to lash out against the inhabitants of a small Southern town. Despite the concerns voiced by a pair of doctors who have identified the recent deaths as being caused by snake bites, the town's greedy mayor is unwilling to alert the authorities for fear that it will have a negative affect on the opening of their new dog track. It is up to the last remaining descendant of Saint Patrick to seek out the evil that is threatening his congregation and destroy it once and for all! JAWS OF SATAN inexplicably combines elements from both JAWS and THE EXORCIST to form ""THE SNAKESORCIST"" in an absurd but oddly hilarious twist on the killer animal genre. The film is completely devoid of logic, and is filled with plenty of awkward moments and inane dialog. It can only be taken halfway serious thanks to Dean Cundy's keen photography and the straightforward performances from each of the cast members, many of whom had to physically handle the intimidating six-foot rattlesnakes. JAWS OF SATAN is only worth watching for its many moments of B-movie cheese, but it ranks right alongside NIGHT OF THE LEPUS when it comes to unintentional humor.

""Jaws"" - a film based on a novel directed by Steven Speilberg from 1975 about a giant shark that terrorizes a Long Island beach town, a sherrif a crazy sailor and ""shark expert"" hunt down the massive shark.

""of Satan"" - (Judeo-Christian and Islamic religions) chief spirit of evil and adversary of God; tempter of mankind; master of Hell

([...])

Yes, that pretty much sums up this strange jumble of a cult film; a small town in Alabama is terrorized by a killer cobra, which threatens to delay the startup of the towns new dog racing park. The local mayor doesn't want to release the news to the public and enlists a doctor from the local hospital and a ""snake expert"" who flies into town to help track the pesky satan-snake. There's also a local priest(down on his faith) who is supposably the reason that satan has come to town, to search out his soul. I suppose this part of the film was ripped from the pages of Exorcist.

So yes, in essence the producers of this film have taken the famous Jaws & Exorcist storylines and substituted an average looking snake. Sounds boring, right? Well you couldn't be more wrong. This film is so ridiculous it borders on amusing and even entertaining. The whole premise of this film is so stupid, and the acting is so superiorly terrible, it somehow gels together in the end as a completely stupid yet entertaining piece of garbage. The film also features a quite young Christina Applegate (in her feature film tour-de-force debut).",1112572800,6,1521,4.703007518796992
