There's no skimpy costume of any kind on the woman who actually does it.  The title is overall very low budget as well.  Though considering these show up from time to time in dollar stores, you can guess as much.

A family member got one of these and was just utterly bored.  There's just one chick giving the moves so no group of people to feel like you're in a class, if you like that.  It's also pretty short.  She really wasn't impressed at all and hasn't picked up the DVD since the first time she touched it.",1347408000,,631,4.208333333333333
