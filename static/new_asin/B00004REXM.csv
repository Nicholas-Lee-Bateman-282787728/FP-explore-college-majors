7921047,4,B00004REXM,"THE DIVIDING HOUR is one of those rarities-a really low budget flick with amateur roots that manages to deliver the goods. Yes it was shot on video, yes the sound could be better (it's especially bad near the end), but all this can be forgiven because it has the single most important ingredient, one which is lacking in many of the big budget, special effects extravaganzas we've been subjected to lately-- originality. And enthusiasm. And a neat idea doesn't hurt either. Okay, so that's more than one, but since when has having more than one virtue a bad thing?

Anyhow, when we meet out 4 young protagonists they're fresh from a bank robbery and looking to shake the cops who are undoubtedly on their tail. They decide to get off the main roads (always a bad decision in horror flix) and find a place to hide out, but their plans are literally thrown for a loop when their car inexpicably swerves off the road and flips into a pond. One of the men is injured, so they think it's their lucky day when a guy in a pick-up truck asks them if they need a ride. They gladly accept (which is also never a good decision in a horror movie) but once they arrive at the isolated farmhouse where they had hoped to find help, everything starts falling apart for them. Now I know what you're thinking, but you're wrong. And that's the beauty of this little gem, it doesn't immediately fall into all the tried and true genre cliches. It keeps you guessing. Plus it uses some stop-motion animation, and any film that does that wins major points from me.

I confess to being a but undecided on this one. On one hand their are some brilliant flashes of originality and on the other it never quite realizes its potential. Technically it's a bit of a mess, but I always appreciate the effort and just plain sweat that people put into films such as this. Oh, if we could only give half stars it would be so mych easier to deal with situations such as this. This is a 3 and 1/2 star film for me and its the stop motion and the last 15 minutes or so that really pushed me into giving it that extra 1/2 star. I'd recommend it only to those who truly appreciate low budget horror that contains little violence and virtually no gore.",1248307200,3,2211,4.390243902439025
7921048,2,B00004REXM,"Hey I love Indie films and B-movies, and though I can appreciate the effort that went into this, the final result was less than lukewarm.

Four bank robbers have a car accident (It was a possumn!!) and are forced to walk the highway. They are picked up by kindly Al and are lead to a farmhouse occupied by a pretty young girl and her deaf/blind father. Well it drags from here and is pretty boring until the rape scene.

***SPOILER AHEAD***

The bank robbers are dead and have been dead since the car crash. The farm house is the key to heaven and hell, known in this movie as the 'dark' and 'light' sides. The balance must be maintained so some go to the light and some go to the dark no matter what.

***End Spoiler***

Some pretty good special effects at the end. The only real problem with this film is it does drag alot, but the sound isn't that great. Shot with a camcorder, it's really hard in some spots to tell what people are saying.

Not bad, but I wouldn't watch it twice.",1104969600,6,984,4.263440860215054
7921049,4,B00004REXM,"The beginning drags a bit, but in the end, I was up in my chair and ready to deal. The creepy atmosphere is the winner in this film. It's not super gory, but there are some good special effects considering the budget.

Give it a try if you like indie films.",1101859200,3,257,4.03921568627451
7921050,5,B00004REXM,"This was a pleasant surprise for a movie that proclaims to have been made for only $7000! It would definitely give Blair Witch a run for its money in production value. I thought the DVD was put together pretty well and there is some pretty insightful behind the scenes. The commentary was amusing by the producers and is worth a listen. But, I was most taken aback by the ""Interview with the Gimp"" - this was hilarious, and could be a cult hit all on its own! Get this movie - not only will you be supporting the Indy generation, you'll be getting one heck of a film... a horror with an intelligent story and unpredictable ending - who could ask for more?!?",1071792000,6,657,4.349593495934959
7921051,3,B00004REXM,"I must say I was really surprised when I saw this film. I admit that I wasn't expecting much. I have been disapointed by indies before, after all. But, considering this movie was made on only a $7000 budget, I was very impressed. The story line was good, plot was full of twists and turns, and the acting wasn't bad (the fight scenes were a bit lacking, though). The relationship between the lead character and his younger brother was very touching and realistic (they are brothers in real life, so perhaps that had something more to do with it).
The story begins with 4 young men, low on cash, who decide to perform a bank heist. While fleeing, they are involved in a car accident, are picked up by a mysterious man named Al, and are taken to a nearby house for help in the form of a young woman and her father.
As they stay at the house under the kind hospitality of Dawn Gates and her deaf and blind father Lewis, waiting for the phone to be reconnected, a series of odd occurences take place, leading up to an unexpected climax where the boys realize things are not as they seem.
Starring, co-written, directed and produced by Mike Prosser (Josh), it also stars Mr. Prosser's brother Brian Prosser (Zack), Brad Goodman (Peter) and Greg James (Dean); Jillian Hodges (Dawn Gates), Max Yoakum (Lewis), and Jay Horenstein (Al), this is an entertaining movie and I really wish that it could be sold/rented in the mainstream video market so everyone can enjoy it. Unfortunately, it can be really hard to find! I definitely recommend it.",1015200000,,1534,4.581818181818182
7921052,5,B00004REXM,"Now here is a video that surpasses the usual drool that most shot on video movies become.  this is truley an excellent peice of work,  its' intense, well thaught out, and technically one of the best digital videos i've seen.  the make up and effects are top notch,  the acting is beleivable,  the  time and effort that was spent on this film have well paid off.  if  shot on video is generally something that turns you off to a movie, i think  this flick will rekindle your hope in low budget films.  tick tock tick  tock, it's time to decide !",956534400,2,544,4.287128712871287
