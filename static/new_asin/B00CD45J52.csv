5715712,5,B00CD45J52,"Excellent.  What night time drama REALLY was.  The actors are required to perform.  No autopsies with exposed body parts..no axe wounds and charred bodies, pure drama.  People with money, who in spite of it all, become unhappy...unloved...non-trusting...forgiving.  Costumes, architecture, magnificent sets, dramatic entrances and threatening exits.  At one point, I had given up on finding this final season on DVD which plays on American disc players and was about to purchase a player that plays all foreign formats.....but, with patience, finally, you offered this final season for our DVD players and there is no one more ecstatic.  I limit myself to only 2 chapters per viewing in order to preserve the series for as long as I can.  Thank you...thank you...thank you",1376956800,,772,5.270491803278689
5715713,5,B00CD45J52,"I know fans of ""Dynasty"" have been crying for years to see the entire series put out on DVD and we are finally getting our wish (although no word yet if the ""Dynasty"" spin-off ""The Colbys"" and the mini-series ""Dynasty-The Reunion"" will ever see the light of day on home DVD release, but my bets they will. The entire series has seen all 9 season fully restored and released by Paramount to other parts of the world, so it will be a matter of time before the last 2 years will see a release here in North America.

 The seventh season began in the fall of 1986 with Blake strangling Alexis when she told him she had ruined him financially and was now the proud owner of the Carrington mansion throwing Blake and his ""blonde tramp"" out on the streets. The first part of the season focuses on Blake's attempt to reclaim his empire and the death of a well-beloved character who was an original cast member. Sadly, though, Catherine Oxenberg, who was a smash with viewers as the beautiful Amanda, was fired by Aron Spelling when she asked for a $1000.00 a week raise and was replaced by an actress who couldn't read a phone book and was promptly fired mid-season.

 This set contains the first 16 episodes of season 7 which finished #24 with a 17.2 Nielsen Rating which marked the first time ""Dynasty"" fell out of the Top 10 rated shows on U.S. television after four years.",1366329600,9,1368,4.46

8580411,5,B00CD45J52,"The claws are out again as the in-fighting between the Carringtons and Colbys continues.  Crystal and Alexis are still trying to out dress/out jewel each other while Blake foots the bills.  That said, this soapie is heads above the trash now appearing on TV.  At least in Dynasty you weren't subjected to profound vulgarity either in speech or mixed suck face or worse humping.  Seems like today's writers can't come up with anything original so they just regurgitate the same old same old in order to sell their series.  Unfortunately filth sells so until the general public says enough is enough and loudly enough guess we can only expect more trash.

Wonder why this soapie isn't appearing on some cable channel?  Would much rather watch a rerun of Dynasty than what's on prime time these days.",1389830400,3,797,4.8161764705882355
8580412,5,B00CD45J52,Dynasty is the best prime-time soap series and is a must for any lover of the tv soap operas.  Linda Evans and Heather Locklear are real knockout blondes!,1379030400,3,154,4.5
