This pacing of the story is of it's time, and feels completely different than the modern show, but I feel that that just show how strong the format is to endure throw the generations.

The one super highlight of the DVD is the mini documentary on Doctor Who in Comics: The 1st Doctor.  I hope to see the continuation of the series with future releases for other Doctors, since one may be surprised about the talent that has worked in Doctor Who comics in the pass would make a amazing set of documentaries.

Again this is story that should be in any fans collection, but I wouldn't use the story as a jumping point for fans drawn in from the modern series.",1214611200,3,1117,6.050632911392405
1904987,5,B0000ADXG7,"I've liked this story from the first time I saw it many years ago. This is the last story from the second season. This story picks up where The Chase left off with the Doctor and Vicki finding new companion Steven Taylor hiding inside the TARDIS. Events from that story are also talked about in this one. They arrive on the eve of an invasion between Vikings and the Normans in 1066. The Monk turns out to be another person from the Doctor's home planet. This would be the first time other than the Doctor and Susan, that we see someone from his home planet although The Doctor's planet wouldn't be named until&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Time-Warrior-Episode-70/dp/B00114XLYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - The Time Warrior (Episode 70)</a>. This is also the first time that we get a story that is based on historical events but with a Sci Fi twist thrown in.

The story itself is quite good and the region 2 disc that I've seen, thanks to a friend, doesn't look too bad so I should think that the region 1 disc will look as good. I hope so as that's the one I'm buying. There are still 11 seconds of the fourth episode that are still missing due to overseas distributors' editing it for viewing. One of the special features goes back and uses both telesnaps, off air recordings and the such to recreate this scene as one of the special features.",1211328000,23,1418,4.908333333333333
1904988,5,B0000ADXG7,"The plot is straightforward:  A historical setting (1066, prelude to the Battle of Hastings.)  Vikings, Saxons, and bits of technological incongruities/anachronisms and a big mystery surrounding a devious monk.
In premise, this is an exceptional story, especially for 1965.  Not only is it the first 'pseudo-historical', it finally pushes ""Doctor Who"" into doing more than using the TARDIS just to get everybody to a funky planet where they get scared out of their wits by some plastic (or invisible!) monster, and acknowledges that there are others like the Doctor, but who aren't as moral as he is.
The Monk is a delightful character (though I disagree he is an early incarnation of the Master.  The Monk clearly has a history of playing with history on a small scale for his own personal gain, the Master has a penchant for seizing power and control whereever and whenever he can.) and well played by Peter Butterworth.  Admittedly, it's great fun to watch him manipulate everybody he deals with.
The only problem is that it's slowly paced.  The big revelation doesn't come until the end of episode 3.  Which is fine, except we're only given small hints at meddling throughout the prior ~65 minutes and everything else happens at a leisurely pace.  For first time viewers in 1965, this story is superlative and makes a top-10 story.  For repeated viewings or in our supposedly enlightened 21st century, the pace is somewhat slowed.  It's still worthy of the top 10 designation, the ideas presented more than make up for the slowness of the plot.
Edith the monk also gets assaulted and almost raped by a Viking.  For a 1965 childrens' show, this is strong stuff.  (as was the attempted rape of Barbara in 1964's ""The Keys of Marinus"".)
A pity the source material isn't that good, but that's the BBC's fault for junking the story in the first place.  At least it exists and was returned to them so we can all enjoy it.
Definitely worth the rent, at the very least.",1090022400,5,1965,4.77810650887574
1904989,4,B0000ADXG7,"Landing in 1066 England with a new companion travelling with the Doctor and Vicki, Steven Taylor, discover a Monk who is hell bent on altering time a few days before the Battle of Hastings. The Time Meddler may be the slowest 4 parter ever in Who's history, but it is also very enjoyable. Peter Butterworth is a perfect fit as the Monk, another renegade Time Lord with his Mark IV TARDIS. Steven skeptical of the TARDIS being a time machine and the disbelief that they're actually in 1066 is a nice touch with his character so early in his development. And Vicki comes off ok. She has the usual goofy deliveries, but this serial is one of her best of the season. The villagers are pretty good. But the Vikings and the fight choreagraphy and the pace of the story are reasons why some might want to steer clear. But the first pseudo-historical in Doctor Who's history is really enjoyable. It's quite a surprise when Vicki and Steven enter the Monk's TARDIS for the first time, and realise that the Doctor's TARIDS isn't the only one. Not to be overlooked.",1078272000,4,1054,4.552631578947368
1904990,4,B0000ADXG7,"That's what Vicki wonders aloud.  The last story of Doctor Who's second season finds the Doctor, Vicki, and Steven landing in Northumbria, in the summer of the fateful year--drum roll please, 1066.  References to that include a conversation with Edith, the wife of the Saxon village headman Wulnoth, who mentions good King Edward, i.e. Edward the Confessor, who died earlier that year, and Harold Godwinson, a.k.a. Harold II, who would be runner-up at the Battle of Hastings.  The Saxons are indeed wary of Viking raids, and sure enough, some of them appear in future episodes.
However, a monk sees the TARDIS land and watches with intense curiosity.  ""I wonder..."" he says pensively.  He also does something extraordinary.  He raises the left sleeve of his robe, and stares in bewilderment at his bare wrist.  Hmmm...
The Doctor's curiosity is piqued by something and to that end, he goes to the monastery, only to find some things that don't belong there, like a grammophone record, for one.  However, he delightfully enjoys the mead offered him by Edith, which he drinks from a horn.
This is Steven's maiden voyage in the TARDIS, and he is skeptical that he has entered a time machine.  His question to the Doctor on some equipment on a ship leads to this reply by the Doctor:  ""That is the dematerialization control.  And that over yonder is the horizontal hold.  Up there is the scanner, those are the doors, that is a chair with a panda on it.  Sheer poetry, dear boy.  Now please stop bothering me.""  Vicki laughs in response to Steven's bewilderment.  On finding a Viking helmet, Steven's skepticism is answered by the Doctor's flippant quip:  ""What do you think it is, a space helmet for a cow?""
This story not only tells the audience that the Doctor's TARDIS is not unique, but also introduces the concept that history can be changed, unlike previous straight historical tales such as Marco Polo, The Aztecs, and The Reign Of Terror.  The regulars turn out well, with William Hartnell (the Doctor) his usual crotchety but curious self, eliciting his high-pitched ""hmmphs!"" and giggles.  Peter Butterworth (the Monk) also comes out good in his comic portrayal.  With Jacqueline Hill (Barbara) and William Russell (Ian) having left the series in the previous story, it falls upon Maureen O'Brien (Vicki) to be senior companion, and she comes out well, with Peter Purves (Steven) showing some resourcefulness in briefly outwitting the Monk in Episode 3.
Not a bad historical story, even if the fight scenes aren't overly dramatic.",1067040000,4,2537,4.938679245283019
1904991,5,B0000ADXG7,"I agree 100% with the previous review this is an excellent example of the early historical adventures and also the first time we meet another member of the doctor's race (still not identified as time lords tho).
(Many Doctor who fans have speculated that the Monk is actually an early reincarnation of the Master.)
There are some wonderful scences in this series of the english coastline and the viking ship invading (although it could be stock footage) and the anacroistic bits with a record player and watches being found in 1066 are classic sci-fi themes.
I bought the entire end of the univrse collection and even tho being the last videos to be realesed, there are still many gems in this collection and this is one of them.",1066608000,,729,4.703125
1904992,5,B0000ADXG7,"This is an excellent sci-fi/historical from the First Doctor.
It is the first full episode to feature companion Steven Taylor.
The Doctor lands in England: 1066 just days before the Norman invasion that leads to the Battle of Hastings.
But the presence of raiding Vikings and a mysterious monk cause the Doctor to worry both for the integrity of the time lines and the lives of himself and his companions, Steven and Vicki.

1905023,4,B0000ADXG7,It was good to see the older Dr. Who series.  They move at a much slower pace than current dr. Who's but it is interesting to see the history of the show.,1356220800,,154,3.8125
1905024,4,B0000ADXG7,"This is one of my favorites of the original Dr. Who, William Hartnell Era, perhaps because of the fact that it is a Viking Story.  Usually, I prefer the six plus episode stories to allow for the necessary character development beyond the story line but this one accomplishes it pretty well in four episodes.

If you are more of a fan of Dr. Who when he goes into our own earth's past rather than into fictional futuristic settings this one is a solid add to your collection.  It is also one of the better ones after the 1st Doctor lost his original companion team (comprised of William Russell, Jacqueline Hill & Carole Ann Ford) The second companion team here of Peter Purves and Maureen O'Brien (who also did some stories with Hill and Russell)are pretty good in this one but it went downhill from there in terms of future companions for Dr. #1 in my opinion.  The quality of the companions of course rebounded during the Patrick Troughton era and beyond...

Overall, a very commendable effort and result!",1355270400,,1007,4.634831460674158

1905028,4,B0000ADXG7,"Assuming you are a Dr Who fan, The Time Meddler is an entertaining adventure from the early days of the program, and well worth a look. The restoration work on the these black and white transmissions is superb, and the special features on the disk are pitched squarely at fans interested in knowing more about the work of restoration. The Time Meddler was played with humour, and was one of the earliest stories to introduce a determined effort to derail history as we know it, so it is something of a milestone in the long running saga that is Dr Who.

Like most of these stories, early Dr Who episodes are going to appeal mainly to the program's fanbase, to those interested in '60s TV, to sci-fi fans, or those interested in fiction of a very British kind. It is not everyone's cup of tea, but for the Dr Who fan, this is a good one.",1299542400,,836,4.358974358974359
1905029,3,B0000ADXG7,"SPOILER ALERT! AFAIK, this is the first presentation of another Time Lord, although I don't recall if they call themselves Time Lords in this story. It was amusing to hear the other make fun of the Doctor's TARDIS. The story line is pretty good, but as usual in this era of Doctor Who, the presentation is very primitive. Zoe and Stephen are annoying, cloying and silly. Nor am I a fan of Hartnell's Doctor. However, this is probably one of the important stories of the Hartnell time and you shouldn't miss it.",1293580800,,510,4.554347826086956
1905030,3,B0000ADXG7,"While this is not the best of the Hartnell years, it stands the test of ""time"" very well (pun fully intended).  One of the ""let's revisit history"" storylines, this introduces the first glimpse of another time-lord, and suggests the Doctor is part of a race instead of merely being a quirky individual.  The character of the monk is quite interesting and rather funny, and the Doctor's disdain for his violation of the ""prime directive"" (to borrow from Trek) is interesting considering the directions the series would take in later years.  Had this avenue been explored, the show might very well have turned out more like Quantum Leap, with the Doctor running around trying to correct mistakes throughout history.  In sum:  a worthy episode, but not as exciting as many others, nor as lavish in scope or atmosphere.  Most of the supporting roles are rather lack-luster.  Of interest mainly to those who are amassing a Hartnell years collection.",1250208000,3,943,4.968152866242038
1905031,3,B0000ADXG7,"When Doctor Who began in 1963, the types of stories it told could be roughly categorized into one of two classifications.  There were the science-fiction stories in which the TARDIS crew would visit the future or an alien world and have some sort of adventure there.  Then there were the purely historical stories -- adventures where the crew would become separated from their ship, be accused of murder, or something along those lines.  These stories would allow children to learn miniature history lessons (one of the original purposes of the show) by showing the regular characters interacting with historical figures.

The important distinction between the two types was that the historical stories contained no science fiction concepts.  The villains were regular humans, not evil alien monsters.  Fights took place using swords or pistols, not death-rays or blasters.

THE TIME MEDDLER changed all this by combining the science fiction with the historical (pseudo-historicals as they became known in fan nomenclature).  Looking back, it's intriguing to see how the production team played on viewer expectations by opening with an adventure set in the 11th century and only slowly dropping clues that a subversion of this story-type is unfolding: a modern wristwatch is found in the woods; a monastery has a phonograph (which apparently broadcasts the ""Chant"" album across the countryside).

The story is relatively straightforward.  Landing in England in 1066, the TARDIS crew are puzzled by the aforementioned anachronistic clues.  The one thing they have in common is a monk who has recently appeared in a previously abandoned monastery.  This character is commonly known in fan circles as the Meddling Monk, who would become a semi-recurring character in one later television serial and a few spin off media appearances.  (Watching this story for the first time in a decade or so, I was stunned by Peter Butterworth's resemblance to New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, complete with hoodie.)

Once the Meddling Monk's scheme is discovered, the Doctor, Steven and Vicki must stop him to prevent the entirety of Western Europe's history from being completely corrupted.  The Monk's plan never feels particularly concrete and so there isn't a lot of drama to be pulled from what is a relatively high concept in this era of the show's history.  The character is also mostly comic relief which makes for fun viewing, but is an odd decision for the serial's only real villain.

THE TIME MEDDLER contains a neat science fiction concept, but it isn't a story that really stands up to multiple viewings (in 1965, it wasn't meant to be seen more than a single time).  Once the secret and the plot are known, follow-up viewings make the serial seem slow to get to the point.  What's left are the performances from the actors and they do in fact just manage to keep the story afloat.  William Hartnell and Peter Butterworth have a great rapport which makes it a pity that Hartnell is absent for all of the second episode.  I particularly enjoyed Alethea Charlton who has a much more subtle character to play than that of the cave-woman which she portrayed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AN-UNEARTHLY-CHILD/dp/B000CNESV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AN UNEARTHLY CHILD</a>.

Still, the script is probably cleverer than it appears at first glance.  Take, for example, the fact that at the beginning of the story, Steven (as a brand new traveler on the TARDIS) is given the standard information dump about what kind of adventures he can expect and how the TARDIS works.  This seems like just the usual material, but for once it actually comes in handy in episodes three and four once the Monk's true nature is revealed.

This DVD release (as usual) contains a much cleaned up and superior picture compared to the old movie-format PBS version that had been my only experience of this serial.  There's a short extra which briefly explores how and where much of the digital scrubbing took place.

The text commentary is informative but seemed even more dry than usual.  If you ever find yourself wondering the exact time of day the actors took their lunch and dinner breaks on the recording days of this serial, then this is the extra for you.

The audio commentary track is crowded in this one: producer Verity Lambert (who unfortunately passed away only months after she recorded this track), actor Peter Purves, story editor Donald Tosh, designer Barry Newbery and commentary moderator Clayton Hickman.  As with other moderated commentary tracks, the conversation very often is not focused onto the on-screen action, but instead in loose discussions.  It's rather refreshing to hear Peter Purves freely admit that he recalls almost nothing specific about this serial.  The track really only gets lively during a digression where Verity Lambert starts dishing the dirt on which male members of the BBC production staff couldn't stand working for a woman.

THE TIME MEDDLER is a decent little story, and, if slow at times, it manages to not become tedious.  The twist is a little long in coming, but there's other stuff to appreciate along the way.  And who hasn't wanted to see someone throw their breakfast on Bill Belichick?",1240963200,7,5276,5.145369284876905

1905046,5,B0000ADXG7,"The BBC has done a fine job restoring this William Hartnell adventure. The video is very crisp and the extras, including audio commentary with original series producer Verity Lambert, are very interesting and informative. This is the first story without any of the original companions; i.e., Susan, Barbara or Ian. The Doctor and Vicki are very surprised to find Steven onboard the TARDIS and have to convince him that the ship actually travels in time - in this instance, to 11th century England. There they encounter the Meddling Monk, a time traveler like the Doctor, but, unlike the Doctor, he enjoys meddling with time and messing with history. Of course, The Doctor puts a stop to that in the end! The sets and costumes are quite interesting, and the other characters in the story - the villagers and the Vikings - are pretty well developed. Well, actually the Vikings are a pretty bumbling bunch, but their costumes are cool! This DVD would make a good addition to anyone's Dr. Who collection.",1221523200,,1000,4.853801169590644
1905047,5,B0000ADXG7,"Part of the idea behind ""Doctor Who"" was that it was going to be used to teach children a little something about history. Well, that pretty much came to an end once the Doctor visited Skaro for the first time, but the show still tried to do historical stories.

The pure historicals are ones like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Aztecs/dp/B00007G1U8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - The Aztecs</a>, where the TARDIS crew winds up somewhere in the past, runs into trouble and has to get out. This is all done without them having to deal with any kind of monsters or sci-fi peril.

But after a while, the powers that be decided the show needed to have a sci-fi angle to every story, so gradually the pure historicals faded away, leaving behind a beast called the pseudo-historical. These are stories that take place in a historical setting, but feature sci-fi elements to them. Aliens meddling in Earth's past, power-mad time-travelers meddling in Earth's past, robot's meddling in Earth's past or, surprisingly enough, other Time Lords meddling in Earth's past.

The first of these, appropriately enough, is ""The Time Meddler"", where another Time Lord (though they weren't called that yet), called the Monk, goes back in time to change the outcome of the Battle of Hastings. He's not exactly evil, more of just a problem. Naturally the Doctor has to put a stop to this nonsense.

The story is quite good as is the acting, and the Doctor comes off as something more heroic than the usual anti-hero role the First Doctor had. I loved what he wound up doing to the Monk at the end of the story.

As for the rest of the episode... well, the sets and costumes are good, as one expects for a historical story. Much less cheese than when they tried to do sci-fi (then again their budget was something like 2000 pounds for an entire season, so yeah).

The extras are nice, including commentary that features Verity Lambert in her last role on the last episode she produced (it was also her last commentary). There's also a nice obit for her, and a few other nice extras, including a feature on the First Doctor's adventures in the ""Doctor Who"" comic strips.

Overall this is a nice purchase. It's always good to see some of the earliest episodes and the extras are nice icing on the cake.",1220486400,5,2344,4.904040404040404
1905048,4,B0000ADXG7,"It's been years since I first saw this episode, and I've rather mixed feelings about it.  Hartnell always had something about him, that little sparkle, that bit of charm that was, in many cases, overshadowed by the stubborness of the character he was playing.  In his later episodes, he was lightened up considerably, whcih really allowed his charismatic side to shine through, and that is very much on display here.  The Who historic episodes went the way of the Dodo after a while, and that is really a shame, as some of them, like the Aztecs for instance were really fantastic.  This one is sort of a hybrid historic episode, with the inclusion of someone from the same place as the Doctor(though not revealed where at this point, as that came much later).  The Monk had lots of possibilities, though few were explired here, and he was not entirely fleshed out.  Still, the time that the Doctor and the Monk share on sreen makes this one worth it, and this episode is worth watching just for its historical value.  Plus, it happens to be very watchable(though I have trouble ever seeing this Doctor without Ian, Barbara, and of course...Susan)",1220400000,2,1146,4.728643216080402

The story is interesting, the black & white film enhances the cheesy sets, the Monk is a great nemesis for the Doctor, and Hartnell is at his most playful when he interacts with the Monk.

The extras aren't anything exciting though.  The Hartnell comic books history is fascinating and the tributes to the late Verity Lambert, first producer of the series, are fine.  The missing scene deleted by overseas sensors was not worth the wait.  It was audio only and you get thirteen seconds of the sound of screaming and grunting.",1219449600,3,786,4.693430656934306
1905051,5,B0000ADXG7,"Never meddle with success, they say. Fortunately the producers of ""Doctor Who"" chose not to heed this warning in 1965, ending the successful second season with this strange tale of time meddling. It's worth bearing in mind that this was a very different era, one in which season endings weren't felt to require earth-shattering cliffhangers or mega-dramatic climaxes, and indeed there is little to distinguish ""The Time Meddler"" from its prior stories in terms of tone or pacing. And yet, mainly in retrospect, it's crucially pivotal in the show's history, introducing unprecedented concepts and themes that we now take for granted as essentially ""Doctor Who"" through and through. And it also succeeds as an entertaining romp of an adventure, to boot.

First of all, ""The Time Meddler"" shines as the prototypical example of the so-called pseudo-historical story, that delightfully distinctive blending of science fiction elements and past historical settings so typical of Doctor Who. Afterwards, that is. Up until this story, the purely science fiction stories and the purely historical stories had remained worlds apart, alternating with each other in almost lockstep fashion. What an innovative brainstorm it was to fuse the two! And something of the excitement of this unusual new approach communicates itself through the mood of the storytelling: we're pulled along by puzzle upon apparently irresolvable puzzle as the Tardis arrives somewhere along the northeastern coast of England in 1066 and what seems like an onlooking medieval monk seems less mystified than intrigued, as if by an unexpected but familiar sight. A monk, as it gradually turns out, who happens to own a wristwatch, a gramophone record player, an electric toaster, a first aid kit with penicillin, and...a Tardis?!

Yes, this is also the first time in the show's history that we get to meet someone else from, well, wherever the Doctor is from. The Meddling Monk, that is, another wanderer in time and space like the Doctor, though with much more of the prankish trickster about him. The way this revelation is weaved into the script is subtle and ingenious, adding a whole dimension to the ongoing series and the mythos of its main character even as, in a way, it reveals nothing and only adds a layer of mystery to it all (a knack that later writers eventually lost, for better or worse). The Monk himself is a great and memorable character, incorrigibly mischievous and yet likable for that very reason--and also for the fact that amidst the mischief and his unconventional methods he has a nice altruistic streak, the desire to ""improve things"" through his time meddling, in this case by wiping out the Viking fleet with space-age weaponry and so allowing King Harold to win the Battle of Hastings, thereby avoiding much of the warfare and strife in Europe that necessarily followed over the centuries. The Doctor will have none of such irresponsible interference, however, and comes down pretty hard on the Monk. Maybe too hard. The Doctor here seems just a bit malicious, possessed of a playfully cruel streak all his own (and perhaps a dash of envy?), reminding me anyway of his more initially unsettling personality in the show's first episodes. Indeed, the ""Battle of Wits"" between the Doctor and the Monk comes across not as a comfortably simple tussle between good and evil but more like a turf war between two unreliably eccentric but powerful renegades. I'm not sure if the writer intended it so, but it's definitely more interesting that way. Even, as the Meddling Monk might say, more fun.

""The Time Meddler"" has much more going for it, too. Stock footage is craftily mixed almost seamlessly into the story, allowing it to transcend the look and feel of the necessarily studio-bound production that it was. Rather maturely horrific incidents are tactfully alluded to and still somehow successfully alloyed with the whimsical humor of the overall adventure. A new companion, Steven Taylor, is introduced and established properly, changing the overall chemistry of the Tardis crew--and confirming such cycling of companions as a permanent fixture of the series. And we get to see the Doctor relish putting away a heady brew of mead with ease, the old devil! In short, this is a quiet classic from the golden age of ""Doctor Who""--sheer poetry, dear boy!",1218153600,16,4342,5.06993006993007

If you described the events that unfold in the Meddling Monk story you might think we were referencing the 2005 series and HAROLD SAXON story arc, not a 1965 episode, because up til this point the the shows history we take for granted that the Doctor & the TARDIS are unique...maybe the ""last of his kind"" even. So although, the Meddling Monk story takes place during a shaky time for the series, what with it's lead character appearing less and less due to the failing health of William Hartnell, and his companions taking on more and more of the series focus. Resulting in Steven and Vicki spending practically all four parts trying to find the Doctor, while the Doctor himself, gets captured, escapes and then recaptured. But, this awkwardness can't diminish the importance of this monumental milestone in Doctor Who history:  It is the first time that the viewer is introduced to another person who is a member of the Doctor's own race. Althought the Timelords still remain unidentified until Wargames (And not long in the series history, before another milestone is reached....the Doctor's ability to regenerate, which follows a short 2 story after this one). Another first for the series that occurs here is the departure from the straight historical story. So far whenever the Doctor has been in the past it has remained true to the history books but, here before long we see the Doctor find not only anachronistic objects (a wrist watch, record player playing monastery sfx, toaster and electric lamp) belonging to the Monk, his ""meddling"" actions bent on altering 11th century history for his own purposes, but an alien craft other than his own and another time-traveler. As obvious as it seems, this was a ""NEW"" twist on the shows time-travel theme. Can history be altered now?

As I said companions Steven and Vicki take center stage for much of this story, proving themselves interesting characters even when not fielding dialogue for the Doc. Steven, in his first full story, having come on board the TARDIS as a stowaway at the end of THE CHASE, takes the opportunity to pick the Doctor & Vick's brains a bit about the abilities of the TARDIS, giving viewer the chance to hear more concepts and details not heard since the pilot. The Monk played by Peter Butterworth also proves an excellent addition to the show in the sole appearance as an interesting character never to return to the TV series, but perhaps inspiration for the Master character to come. Although, there is much debate among fans has taken place over the year for and against the likelihood that pair of rogue Timelords are in fact one in the same. But, common reasons against are as follows: The Doctor says that he is ""50 years earlier"" suggesting he left Gallifrey 50 years before the Monk did and that they have never met before. There are many references that the Master and the Doctor were contemporaries; he and the Monk are not. Also the M.O. of the Monk is dissimilar, unlike the Master, the Monk isn't interested in creating chaos or even world domination, he IS motivated by self-interest in manipulating time to his advantage, like his examples: He claims to have put 200 pounds in a bank account in 1968, and then collected a fortune in interest 200 years later. He also admits to helping the ancient Britons build Stonehenge using an anti-gravity lifter. The Monk is a character you almost can't help, but like, his wicked sense of humor...laughing at the Doctor trapped like a mouse, brings out a similar wickedness in the Doctor...as seen when the Doctor holds the Monk at er...""gunpoint."" Unlike, the Master, you don't get the sense that the Doctor holds him as any kind of a real threat...he even says as much himself.

The Monk's plan is to save Harold's army from having to attack the Vikings by destroying the fleet with a bazooka-weapon-of-sorts, allowing King Harold to face the forces of William of Normandy with a fresh army at the Battle of Hastings thus, ensuring that William is defeated at Hastings and thus bringing a period of peace to Europe. With the Monk's help, he hopes that the British will have jet propelled airliners by 1320 .
....interesting that, HAROLD and the SAXONs and the Doctor learning that he isn't alone, while another of his kind prepares to alter the future of mankind....this all seems so familiar but I can't put my drumming fingers on in (drum-drum-drum...drum-drum-drum...drum-drum-drum...)

Here are some GREAT LINES from the story!...The Doctor giving Steven the Tour of the TARDIS...

""That is the dematerialisation control, and that over yonder is the horizontal hold. Up there is the scanner, those are the doors, that is a chair with a panda on it... Sheer poetry, dear boy! Now please stop bothering me!"" Genus!!

7996717,3,B0000ADXG7,"I'm not a big fan of this episode and the North American DVD certainly does not warrant a $100-$150.00 price tag, I don't care who is selling it. The story is not in my top 5 or 6 full story episodes from the Hartnell era available to buy in the U.S.
I'd have to say that The War Machines & The Romans top the list for storytelling as would of course An Unearthly Child, The Daleks and the Dalek Invasion of Earth. The Space Museum and Planet of Giants rounds out what I think are the top episodes that have survived.
The ONLY notable thing about this episode is that as far as I know it's the only surviving story from the 1st Doctor that depicts any other Time Lords or even says anything about where The Doctor comes from.
To me that's the only part of this that I really enjoy but I would never spend the crazy amount they are asking for this one DVD, I paid $299.99 for the Series 1-7 gift set on Blu-ray and that was a good price for an awesome set.
I paid $40.00 for a pristine copy of Patrick Troughten's last story The War Games through Buybacks but that's as far as it goes, there is no single story of Doctor Who I would ever pay over $50.00 for and that is still pushing it in my opinion.
If you are trying to collect the entire 50 years of stories of Doctor Who like I am, start with the cheapest and also look for the deals as much as possible... The Key To Time set you can find for about $67.00 for 6 stories and 7 DVD's in all so what you end up really paying is about $10.00 or less an episode (story) which is a good deal.
The Leisure Hive, The Sontaran Experiment, The Horror of Fang Rock The King's Demons, Destiny of the Daleks and Revelation of the Daleks, Arc of Infinity are all nearly $10.00, a little over or under. And of course The beginnings Set with An Unearthly Child/The Daleks/Edge of Destruction is a great price at the current $17.00. Same for The Space Museum/The Chase which is good at $25.00.
I got Trial of a Time Lord for wonderful price of only $12.00 for the entire set, brand new still in plastic by using rewards points at Sears.com that they have been randomly awarding members.
If you are trying to collect the entire DW 50 year history on DVD really spend wisely, and go between Amazon, Walmart and Sears.com which all carry a good deal of the episodes at various prices with Free Shipping on orders. Sears.com especially, be careful and don't buy from a 3rd party. Get it directly from Sears because the shipping is free even on a single DVD like The Horror of Fang Rock.
The BEST story for the money from the Tom Baker era in my opinion is The Robots of Death at about $16.00
Sometimes it's best to order whole groups of different Doctors at a time or do group orders. Think about it for the price you would pay just to have The Time Meddler which is a mediocre story at best you could have practically the entire Sylvester McCoy run or the same for the Colin Baker run or at least all your favorite top Tom Baker episodes for the same price as The Time Meddler.",1390780800,,3012,4.21280276816609
