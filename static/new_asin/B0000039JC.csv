7902344,5,B0000039JC,"This tape is AWESOME!! I am now looking online to see if he has any others!  I've only done it one time and I LOVE it...It's all in what you like and what u are looking for. I was looking for high impact and something to keep my attention and this is great!  I have several tapes/dvds and this is the best by far, other than my Donna Richardson and Zumba!  I love this, u don't feel like u're working out, it's just fun!!!",1109721600,2,422,4.0
7902345,5,B0000039JC,"I have had this tape for about 5 years now and ALWAYS come back to it. It is high/low mix and is very challenging, but very fun, as well.  The music is good, also. It is fast-paced, but it really keeps you working. I highly recommend it!",1068076800,4,237,4.042553191489362
7902346,5,B0000039JC,"Of all the exercise videos I have, this is one of my favorites.  Yes, it is a long video of high impact aerobics but the instructor kept me motivated and made me want to do this video more than once.  It is difficult at first, but its high impact, what do you expect?  Once you do it a few more times, the moves get easier while still giving you a killer workout.  People who are serious about their workouts, ignore the look of the instructor and pay attention to what they get out of the workout.  He also gives you the option to work out at high impact or to follow one of the girls for a lower impact workout.  Personally, he made me want to stay at the higher impact and do his workout over and over again.  I have been working out for a while now and he still manages to work every muscle.  I still wake up a little sore.  This is a great video.",1030233600,7,851,4.017857142857143
7902347,3,B0000039JC,"Okay, I've honestly only done this video once, but I'm not really looking  forward to doing it again.  I read other reviews and the consensus was that  this was a little silly and that it was at times a little ""too  dancy"" to be an aerobics video.  But my ego said ""Hey, you've  danced for years, and it's just about getting up and moving, right?""  Wrong.  First off, the instructor's hair annoys me.  And the little  headband he wears to ""try"" and keep it out of his face doesn't  work.  I agree with the other reviewer that the first part of the video was  relatively easy.  It was and I found myself thinking that this wasn't hard  at all.  And then he got a little fancy.  This isn't for a beginner at all  and I don't recommend wearing shoes with this video if you have carpet.  He  (I don't remember his name) likes to display his dancing prowness.  He  throws in little kick ball changes and three step turns.  Okay, running  into my living room furniture with a dizzied twirl is NOT my idea of a  workout.  Yes, the exercises will raise your pulse.  But it would have been  better if the little dance moves and turns had been left on the cutting  room floor.",965520000,18,1166,4.293023255813954
