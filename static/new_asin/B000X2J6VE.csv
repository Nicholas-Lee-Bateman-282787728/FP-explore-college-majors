8325887,5,B000X2J6VE,"This movie has great visuals and useful tips.  I love fishing in Central Colorado and this DVD took me right back there.  The guides were friendly and spoke about their tips openly and even though I am a veteran flyfisher, I still learned some new things that'll work in rivers near me.

The cinematography plus the info make this a great new DVD and I reccomend it even if you never fish in the great Roaring Fork Valley.  For 14.95 it's a sweet deal,  thanks.",1199232000,,461,4.376470588235295
