8239894,5,B00112HRD4,What a find. You don't come across these old movies much any more. This one stars Bela Lugosi in one of his better films and one that I had never seen before. It is a great mystery movie with a gret ending. If you like old B/W mysterys this is one of the best.,1415577600,,260,3.8333333333333335
