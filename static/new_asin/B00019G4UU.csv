1981834,4,B00019G4UU,"Palestinian director Michel Khleifi was born in Nazareth in 1950 and emigrated to Belgium in 1970, working in Belgian TV in the 1970s before turning to filmmaking. I believe this was his first feature, and it won the FIPRESCI prize at Cannes in 1987. On IMDb it's credited as a coproduction between Israel, France and Belgium; the Wikipedia page substitutes Palestine for Israel; one could read these complexities as symbolic of the complexities inherent in the film itself and, I suspect, a great percentage of films from Palestinian filmmakers.

The mukhtar (roughly equivalent to ""mayor"") of a small Palestinian village wants to have a big wedding for his son, but has to contend with the curfew imposed by the Israeli government. A solution is proposed: the military governor of the area is to be allowed to attend the ceremony with several of his officers - leading to much strife between the mukhtar and many of the other village elders. As the preparations get underway, some friends of the groom clumsily plot a kidnapping, and a couple of younger children get in trouble with a horse in a place they're not supposed to go. Meanwhile tensions lie uneasily for all of the adults - not the least the strong-willed bride and the rather weak and possibly impotent husband.

This is a solid, fascinating drama about the troubles an uneasy occupation cause on an everyday peacetime event, and it never forgets to remind us that the Israelis and Palestinians have as many similarities (in appearance, food, and language among other things) as differences. It's fairly sexually provocative; I don't know how common this is for films from either Palestine or Israel as I'm really just starting to learn about the cinema of this area. One of the stereotypes that Americans have about Muslim and Arab peoples is that they're sexually repressed, and I wonder at times if the abundant nudity here, and in several films from more ""liberal"" Arab countries like Tunisia and Algeria is in some ways a deliberate rebuke to western prejudices. In the case of this film I do think it's warranted, as the sexual tensions amongst the younger members of the Israeli government contingent (one of whom is female) and some of the young unmarried friends of the bride and groom are an important subtext: these enemies can share food and drink, laugh at the same jokes, speak each others' languages, but clearly some fraternizations are taboo, and we wonder if things would not be better were that not the case. The film wisely doesn't offer any solutions; nor does it seem in the end hopeless - merely somewhat resigned.

As some others have commented, this was shot pretty dark - like a few other features from the area that I've seen, it uses natural light almost exclusively, and some of the interiors aren't artificially lighted, so you may have to adjust your contrast or brightness significantly.",1379462400,,2884,4.893660531697342
1981835,1,B00019G4UU,"Poorly acted, poorly filmed and poorly edited. The lighting was one of the worst I've ever seen in a movie.",1376006400,,107,4.4
1981836,5,B00019G4UU,"OK - this is not your typical slick Hollywood production but it's got great merit and shows you a slice of life that most Westerners never see.  It seems to present a quite balanced view of the situation at the time that it was made and manages to be entertaining as well as educational ... sweeping the viewer along from relaxed enjoyment to heart stopping tension smoothly without the feeling that you are being dragged along by the plot - following a simple story of a wedding there is no real ""plot"" in conventional film-making style - the story is well told and flows well.

Some parts of the movie are visually very dark, night is night when there is virtually no electricity and the director doesn't try to show this otherwise - so the viewer has to work at the movie a little in places.  Oh yes, and it's a ""European"" movie - if you're a prude then go buy something else - there's no sex in the movie but there are scenes where people have no clothes.  Most people know the difference.",1355875200,2,993,4.380434782608695
1981837,5,B00019G4UU,"One of the rare films that dares to show the complicated inter-relationship between Arab and Israeli without making anyone into a cliche US, International media, and anti-Israeli biased UN created stereo-types.

One can appreciate the resentment of an occupied people wishing to live a normal life, and simultaneously understand the underlying Israeli distrust and under siege mentality driven by fear of Palestinian terror, which creats a great deal of suspense and sense of dread, but ultimately this film is not about war, but about bringing enemies together in a rare celebration of life rather than perpetuating or encouarging violence.

I applaude this intense, unique film for its technical and creative achievment, and its positive spirit expressing that beneath all conflict, we'd be better off learning compassion rather than hate and hostility, and as we accept each other as human beings, perhaps we may resolve our miscommunication, a prodigious well executed undertaking by the director of this moving film.",1270166400,,1021,5.455696202531645
1981838,5,B00019G4UU,"One of the best foreign films I've ever seen, Wedding is also perhaps the only Israeli-made film that is sympathetic to Arabs. In both Hebrew and Arabic Khleifi tells the story of a Palestinian man during the Israeli occupation who wishes to have a normal, large wedding for his daughter, and is granted that permission as long as the Israeli military governor can come as the guest of honor. What is wonderful is this film doesn't follow an easy path in which every one suddenly gets along. It presents the true animosity and difficulties in the relationships between Israelis and Palestinians: the fear that rules Israeli lives, and the constant control the Palestinians are placed under. And yet there are moments when both sides can also see each other as human. The Israeli soldiers see simply a family desiring to celebrate a life boundary event, and there is great compassionate expression in the care for a female Israeli soldier.
 There is also a very interesting subtext of gender dynamics within Arabic and Islamic culture. How do men and women relate to each other in the traditional manner during an occupation? The Arab dynamic is contrasted with the more relaxed gender interaction of the Israelis. While there is some unfortunate brief full nudity, it adds to a very interesting moment exploring the cultural value of a broken hymen and what this shows of the power relationships inherent in a culture where a man can gain honor but a woman can only lose hers. The bride finds a way to reverse this through following the cultural dictates *and* gaining control of her own body. I encourage everyone to view this movie to see how she accomplishes this, and to understand how these two very different and very valuable cultures interact in this time of turmoil.",998956800,53,1775,4.858085808580858
