8232710,5,B000YGP6UE,"I had borrowed this DVD from a friend and was delighted to get my own copy!  There are several different 10-minute workouts, and you definitely get the heart rate pumping!  It arrived brand new!",1323302400,,194,4.676470588235294
8232711,2,B000YGP6UE,"The concept behind this dvd is one I hope someone else picks up as it's a great idea...rather than 45 minutes of the same instructor doing a whole video, take some fitness dvds and put the best parts into one so that you can either do one, or several and keep it different for the whole workout with different instructors, settings, music, etc.

Except that's not exactly what happened here. But I'll get to the negatives in a minute as to why it didn't quite fly...first I'll touch on each dvd segment that's included...and that alone will begin to hit on a few negatives as well.

Note: I have a collection of over 100 fitness dvds Ive amassed over the years of working out daily to them and one of the reasons I do is because I need the variation daily to keep me motivated. That's what the concept of this reminded me of--being able to ""switch it up"" even in just one dvd...it just didn't pan out

(Also Note: When I mention the calorie burn, it's scientifically measured not just perceived exertion. I wear a bodybugg...so I can measure how many calories I burn during a dvd routine and also see how many calories I burn per minute. It measures my daily caloric burn but I can also set it to monitor a workout. I mention this only so you know when I talk about how many calories each segment burned it's based on true measurement rather than perceived exertion.)

The Method Dynamic Cardio...Good lord skip this one altogether. It was horrid cueing. I gave up and turned it off and went to another segment because I kept having to rewind it to figure out what the heck she was doing because she'd just jump into something without you knowing it was about to happen and then something else. This is labeled as a beginner level anyway and burned very few calories per minute due to it so it's not worth the frustration for such low caloric burn.

QuickFix Hip Hop: I actually own this full dvd and I think the instructor has some of the best energy I've seen in any fitness dvd. She does do great cueing but she moves too fast for me or doesn't explain it in a way I can easily pick up. I rarely use the dvd I have because of this but I keep hoping I'll pick up the moves without getting tripped up...This segment is from the beginning of her dvd so it's really more of a warm up anyway. You will burn very few calories here as well. This is labeled ""beginner"" too.

Quick Fix Cardio Kick: I like this one. The cueing is good and it's easy for any level to do. Better caloric burn but not great and this is the WORST music I've ever heard on a fitness dvd. Trust me on this one...If I say it sounds like fingers down a chalkboard I assume you think I mean it's grating...no, it SERIOUSLY and LITERALLY sounds like fingers on a chalkboard. It's an extremely odd electronica that is loud and not at all in step to the beat of the routine. For example, during the warm up it goes faster than any other part of the routine. It's crazy. And it's not like I don't like loud hip music...just not this loud crazy screeching. Still, I like the instructor and routine. A medium calorie burner.

Buff Moms: An unusual one to include. Although it doesnt say ""new moms"", throughout the entire routine she makes referances to your baby. ""Reach up just like you are always reaching up to put things away from the reach of your baby now"" ""Bend down like you are picking up your baby"". ""Your baby is sleeping so put that weight down gently"" stuff like that. Apparently she was referraing to my Pomeranian. This one utilized strength and cardio. I liked it but burned few calories in comparison to other dvds. Good cueing. Low energy in the instructor with kind of a coldness...but not a toughness like Jillian on the Biggest Loser...just looked like she was out of energy and not having much fun.

Quick Fix Hit the Spot Total Body: Best part of the dvd. This one offered a very good calorie burn, great cueing, instructor with excellent energy. Oddly, apparently the original dvd that this segment was taken from came with colored dots you put on the floor and workout around so she'd tell you to ""bend down and pick up the last dot"" or ""march around your line of dots"" but you don't have any dots because this dvd comes without the plastic dots. As long as it doesn't throw you for a loop in confusion, it makes no difference, the dots are kind of a gimick anyway...you can bend down without picking up a dot and you can walk in a straight line with no dots on your floor anyway. Great segment here.

The Method Cardio Kick: I laughed when this segment began because I couldn't hear what she was saying because they, I kid you not, have a group of African drummers in the corner of the room drumming during the segment. I thought I wouldn't be able to take it but I actually wound up really liking the drum beats after it got going and I could hear her.  It was kind of cool to me and different. However, There was segments with very poor cueing in this one...in that she'd tell you what you were about to do but in a way that made no sense so you'd just have to watch and figure it out while you stood there and she moved. For example, at one point she says "" Here we go...One Two Open Reach, Now go."" You tell me what you expect to do with that cue. Then you are marching and she says ""Now...Foreward, Back, Foreward...Go"" So I start marching foreward thinking I will obviously be marching foreward backward then foreward but that cue apparently was to do a lunge foreward, a lunge backward and then a lunge foreward again. Who knew. Lest you think I'm just sensitive, I should mention that all the background trainers got lost as well many times during this routine with her cueing and THEY practiced it endless times before production. Cracked me up that they didn't cut out those parts of them just stopping and trying to figure out what she meant! Another one? ""Back up center hip up"" riggggght. What does that even mean? Why even say it...it offers really no cueing at certain times.
That said, it burned a lot of calories once you rewound it enough times in the segments where she made no sense. In many parts she offered good cueing so it was NOT a total loss and it wasn't like you get tripped up the whole time...some parts are easy to follow...I think I'll just do jumping jacks through those odd parts.

Now for the negatives as a whole dvd: First, each segment is about 10 minutes long. It allows you to pick a few segments in order to do a whole routine or just start from the beginning and do the whole dvd BUT most of the routines begin with a warm up so if you want to combine two together the warm up is not separate like in other fitness dvds...so just when your heart rate is at its fat burning peak, the next segment will begin and you will be barely moving and ""warming up"" all over again even if you are MORE than warm.  Also at the end of several of the segments you do a cooldown which means, for a ten minute routine you barely get any workout at all. That's not the only bad part of the editing. The last thing you'll hear on this dvd during the last segment is ""Wow. That was tough. We really need a cool down now so get ready and we'll begin"" or something like that...and the dvd ends. There is no cool down. Did they edit this AT ALL?

If you are doing a segment you grow tired of or don't like you can't just hit ""next"" like on other dvds and skip to a new part...it will actually go back to the BEGINNING. I kmow...freak of nature dvd...you have to do it oldschool and just hold down your fast foreward button until you get to another routine which, of course, makes your heart rate go down while you do that. Craziness.

I suspect this compilation was their attempt to show you segments of the dvds they've done to get you interested enough to buy the dvds...almost like a trailer of each one. Problem is, in the end, it has to be a good dvd to burn calories or it misses the mark of what you buy it for. Thankfully I bought it for a couple bucks at a discount department store so I know why it made its way there and I can't complain too much but there are just way too many good fitness dvds out there to get one that apparently has such little thought into putting it together...seems thrown together editing-wise with little interest in caloric burn or keeping your heart rate up or offering a cooldown...I don't need a warm up in the middle of my workout and a ten minute routine that burns 25 calories offers little bang for the buck if you just do a segment alone. I'd burn more vacuuming my floor and wind up with clean floors too. On some of these segments I lose 10 minutes of my day, get no clean floors, and little calorie burn anyway.

I gave it two stars because I like the Quick Fix Hit the Spot and can get through a few parts of a few of the other ones.",1256774400,2,8792,4.291139240506329
8232712,1,B000YGP6UE,"this DVD was a big disappointment! it was really boring and way too easy. it might be good if you've just started working out, but even the intermediate levels get old quick. the kickboxing was ok, but it was only 10 min.  You would be better off buying the 2nd video in Carmen Electra's Strip sereis called 'Fit to Strip'",1218499200,,322,4.366666666666666
