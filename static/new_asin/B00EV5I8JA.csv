5948447,5,B00EV5I8JA,"Love this show and so glad it's getting a US release I wasn't sure if it was.  No spoilers here
I heard someone once call it a ""Political Black Lagoon"" if you've seen Black Lagoon I think that's pretty dead on saying.
Just a story of Mercenary/Arms Dealer and there Dealing in the world. Great show with good action but mostly the political side of there Dealing which creates a great story so no real disappointment there yet enough action to keep things exciting.

Personally for me the only  2 downsides were the animation style on some characters such as Koko,  not a big deal at all but it did take me a few episodes to get used to it. The thick white eyelashes and thick white eye brows look like double eye brows at times and Koko came off as more of a guy then a girl at first Most won't even notice but few them seem kinda off at times.

Second when I look back on it I kinda feel like the story went so Far and grabbed you yet... went nowhere with it. Its begging for a second season. You'll understand that once you watch it. Even if it never does get another season it's still a great show.  This is really the one true downside for me.

All in all I would give it a
10/10 if based off Anime similar to it in its same catagory.
7/10  when compared to All the Anime I've watched.",1380240000,23,1290,4.132

5948451,5,B00EV5I8JA,"When Jormungand first came to my attention, it reminded me very much of Black Lagoon. Bright visuals, gun-toting protagonists, and bullets flying in all directions. However, once I began to dig into the show, I found it to be so much more than it appeared at first glance. The show still reminds me of Black Lagoon, but it has a flavor and theme all its own that keeps it standing strong as its own distinct anime.

The show focuses on a young, eccentric arms dealer named Koko Hekmatyar and her merry crew of mercenaries sworn to protect her. With the exception of her driver, all of them have a military past and as a result, they're deadly as all hell. The most recent addition to Koko's group is a child soldier named Jonah, and he in many ways acts as the main character. Much of the show deals with Jonah adapting to life with Koko and her bodyguards, and a decent amount of comedy ensues with them trying their best to give Jonah an otherwise normal childhood (each team member does their best of offering him a formal education, with varying success).

While I was initially drawn to the show for its action, it has great characters and they go through some genuine development. Koko and her team display a great sense of camaraderie, and you really do feel like they're all friends. They may be arms dealers, but Koko and her crew have a strict sense of honor and never engage in behavior that I'd consider ""bad""; they kill, but they only ever kill other mercenaries, most of whom attack them first. In real life, most arms dealers aren't what you'd consider good people, but I never once saw Koko or her underlings as bad people; on the contrary, they almost seem like superheroes.

I especially want to draw attention to Koko herself, because she is one of my favorite female anime characters in recent years. She's intelligent and calculating and she's not afraid to get her hands dirty, but that side of her personality is reserved for her enemies. To her crew, Koko is friendly and warm, and treats some of them like family (in particular, she sees Jonah as a little brother). She is a woman you'd hate to have as an enemy, but love to have as a friend; she's a bit of a weirdo, but chances are, you'll love her all the more for that.

As for the visuals, I will say this; it looks fantastic! Seriously, Jormungand takes place in quite a few visually appealing environments, from seaside metropolises to snow-capped mountains. The characters themselves are all quite well-animated and expressive; in terms of character animation, I'd say it actually surpasses the comparable Black Lagoon. Some anime have this problem where the environments are boring and the characters are well-animated or vice versa, but Jormungand remains consistent in its visual quality; no complaints here.

As for the action, it too is quite nicely animated and enjoyable to watch. Whether it's one of the many gunfights going down or Valmet slicing up some bad guys with her blades, there's quite a bit of bloodshed going on. If you look for action in an anime, I guarantee you won't be disappointed with Jormungand.

On a side note, the opening theme song is awesome! The closing theme is also quite nicely performed; from beginning to end, there's a lot to enjoy with this show.

I can't say enough good things about this show. The characters are great, the visuals are a feast for your eyes, and the action is fast and fun to watch. If you want good characters, you'll like this show. If you want good action, you'll like this show. If you want both, you will LOVE this show.",1432684800,,3568,4.618296529968454
5948452,5,B00EV5I8JA,"This is a great anime. While not as dark as Black Lagoon, this series definitely is very addictive. It has a light-hearted tone that often times works in its favor (in my opinion) and gives a different perspective to such depressive concepts. Receives my full-hearted recommendation.

I highly recommend this along with Black Lagoon for a perfect action-packed viewing experience.

Great story, great characters, overall decent animation - five star product all the way around.

The BD is nice too for its audio. No noticeable banding or upconversion pixelation. Definitely worth it - support Koko.",1405900800,,356,5.2105263157894735
5948462,5,B00EV5I8JA,"Black Lagoon became the anime action king in 2006 with its non-stop thrills, blood and fearless take on unfettered organised crime. The Second Barrage was even better, with content so extreme it's difficult to watch.

I am happy to proclaim a new champion on the hill: Jormungand. While Black Lagoon's crew are tied together by fear and mutual exploitation, Jormungand's operation is slick, well-oiled and cemented on a solid foundation of respect and co-operation. Most of Koko's crew are ex-army elites (except for Jonah). Velmet is one of the most formidable and terrifying femme fatales of the past decade in anime. Her story arc spans several episodes and is almost resolved at the end of the series. Almost.

Character development is complete and never dull. The majority of expositions are crisp and to the point. Villains are a riot to watch and never overstay their welcome. The man-girl slaughterhouse Orchestra and the threesome of havoc are two cases in point. Speaking of which, so are the battle scenes. They're never slow or drawn-out. It's like the budget for Hellsing Ultimate was crammed into 4-minute bursts of sheer action win. The scenes with the CIA and KoKo's underhanded dealings in the high-stakes weapons industry are a fun way to look at the death merchant industry without trivialising the scene too much.",1402444800,3,1333,5.054545454545455
5948463,5,B00EV5I8JA,"I won't go much into the plot, the ""amazon review"" does a decent enough job of that. I'll keep this short and simple, if you are a fan of BLACK LAGOON then this show is right up your alley. Plenty of shooting, guns, killing, blood, likeable characters and BAD ASS women lol. With that said, i don't fully ""agree"" with the animation style, but i do appreciate it for being a bit different (eyebrows). I would recommend to any one who needs a ""fix"" for that rush that black lagoon gave #Must Buy",1396051200,,493,4.311827956989247

8609786,5,B00EV5I8JA,Just finished both Season after buying them all. This is a new Anime Classic! KOKO! is one of my new top favorite badass ladies in anime. The Dub cast and japanese cast make this show really sparkle voice wise. At the time of this review the seasons are 30$ a piece which is a bargain. The extra features are much better on this release then most funimation releases you don't get on extras stream. I highly recommend buyin and supporting this release its worth the price for your collection. The anime has already been reviewed so go read that and see what you think but its a well crafted series done right so enjoy:),1453075200,,619,4.43859649122807

8609788,5,B00EV5I8JA,Yes. There are some anime that could absolutely be made into live action movies.  Although I don't believe that would do anything but diminish them.  This is one of my favorites.,1442275200,,178,4.709677419354839
