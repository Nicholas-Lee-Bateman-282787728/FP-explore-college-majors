Sullivan look good...and at that it succeeds, but don't go expecting biographical accuracy. See this film because it's a heroic myth-maker and one of the best of the early boxing films. The cast is strong including Linda Darnell and Rory Calhoun. I haven't seen this film in years and am curious as to whom owns the  distribution rights since it hasn't popped up on TCM or in any of the revival film houses in a long time. It would be a great part of a sports or boxing set....maybe a Raging Bull, Rocky, Million Dollar Baby and The Fighter and The Great John L. collection.....Maybe this will happen if the new Rocky musical on Broadway catches on...Since the film is in black & white, it might be a bit of a hard sell in a color film world but it's a shame that such a solid movie just sits and gathers dust in some film vault. The one copy I have seen listed for sale has an exorbitant price so be careful about what you pay!",1396828800,2,1102,4.2727272727272725
