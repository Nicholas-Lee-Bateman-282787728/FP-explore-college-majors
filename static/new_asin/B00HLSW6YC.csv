6167638,5,B00HLSW6YC,This film is magnificent! Brilliant! Gorgeous! Entertaining from the first scene. I'm glad I went to see it and recommend it to every human on earth.  Fight tyranny and win!,1394323200,4,173,4.766666666666667
6167639,2,B00HLSW6YC,"This was one of my favorite cosmic myths until this film. The action was a ridiculous slow motion. What was that lion looking thing? Did Asylum make this film? Couldn't they hire any actors? Kellan Lutz? Did the ""Twilight"" series zap him of his acting ability too? Sure I knew how it ended, but at least try to entertain me. I would have never believed I would be pining for the old black and white Hercules movies dubbed in English.

Hercules was dull, lifeless, and couldn't read a line. What was with the buzz cut? It rates a razzy. I can't wait for the spoof.

6167640,1,B00HLSW6YC,Were the heck do I begin. The story rips off the first Thor and The Prince of Egypt and mixes them and also tries make the story the worst thing ever written. The fight scenes have some of the worst CGI ever made and has a cast that only scream and do not shut their mouths and have the worst acting I have ever seen since The Last Airbender . The Characters are dull and unlikeable and are just and excuse for guys with big nipples and muscles and models at Macy's to put in an action film. I was looking forward to this film and now I wanna see the one with The Rock because that one will be better than this horrible terrible film. BYE BYE.,1390608000,4,643,4.03125
6167641,3,B00HLSW6YC,"Legend of Hercules hit certain marks of what I was looking for before going in to see it.
1. Does it have Action? Yes. And lots of it. The action scenes clearly take heavy inspiration from 300's slow motion effect, so if you like that, the only thing missing here is the blood, as this is a safe PG 13.
2. Does it have a story of some kind that is understandable with interesting characters? Done. Is it great? That depends on what you compare it to. Honestly, the story could use refinement, but this movie is about the action first.
3. Some scenes showing Hercules' trademark strength? Yes. Just watch the final act and a lot of the fights.

If you can look past the simple, familiar plot and just enjoy the action, this movie is worth a look. The 3D effects are outstanding with lots of stuff popping out and a cool sense of depth.

Action Scenes:
Intro Sword Fight and War.
Fight against a (comical Computerized) Lion.
Fight against a small army of archers in a cave.
Fight in a big arena with a pit with rocks and two fighters (Hercules and Spartacus) against some bad guys.
Fight against 6 warriors versus Hercules. Guess who wins?
Fight against some village goons using a pair of stones.
Fight against an army with an electrical sword.
Fight against the main bad guy King to save the princess.

Scenery: Good scenery.
Cinematography: Good.
Acting: Beginner actors, among one or two accomplished actors. Could have been better.
Story: Not brain science; about rescuing a princess and stopping an evil King and brother.
Does it make sense? There are some errors and comical sequences, but it still makes sense most of the time.
3D: Outstanding.
Action: Fun and easy to watch. Best parts of the movie and the reason to see it.",1390348800,73,1730,4.574193548387097
6167642,1,B00HLSW6YC,"Hercules has always been a popular subject for movies. So after movies like ""300,"" ""Immortals"" and ""Clash of the Titans,"" it's not surprising that Hollywood would dredge him up again.

Unfortunately, they cast the meathead from ""Twilight"" as Hercules.

And the terrible casting is only one of the problems in ""The Legend of Hercules"" -- it feels like a cheap TV movie version of an actual blockbuster movie, with claustrophobic sets, random eruptions of slow-mo and uber-cheesy dialogue. Even worse, it cribs from the earlier Grecian myth movies while lacking even a shred of their style.

Repelled by her power-hungry husband King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins), Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) makes a deal with the goddess Hera: Zeus will have sex with her, and she will have a son named Hercules who will destroy Amphitryon. Amphitryon, suspecting the baby isn't his, names him Alcides.

Two decades later, Alcides/Hercules (Kellan Lutz) is in love with Princess Hebe (Gaia Weiss), but she's betrothed to his wimpy brother Iphicles (Liam Garrigan). They try and fail to run away together, and Amphitryon punishes Alcides/Hercules by sending him off on an undermanned mission.

Of course, the undermanned mission gets slaughtered, except for Hercules and his buddy Captain Sotiris (Liam McIntyre), and they are quickly sold into slavery as gladiators... because yeah, they had LOTS of those in ancient Egypt. Hercules' superhuman strength allows him to free himself and Sotiris, but he must somehow seize his father's kingdom before his brother weds Hebe... or something like that.

""The Legend of Hercules"" really feels like a TV movie knockoff of a blockbuster movie, or maybe a halfhearted TV pilot. It certainly doesn't feel like a movie with seventy million dollars behind it -- everything feels very cheap and lackluster, especially since they apparently have no sets larger than my living room, and the special effects are mostly confined to bad lightning flashes.

Of course, director Renny Harlin doesn't help matters. After all, this is the guy who gave us movies like ""The Covenant,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 4,"" ""Cutthroat Island"" and ""Exorcist: The Beginning,"" so he directs like an amateur who has just figured out the mechanics of film.

For instance, the movie has random bursts of slow-motion -- not the climactic parts of fights, but horses leaping over logs or Hercules tossing a dead body away. It's like Harlin keeps dozing off and accidentally pushing the ""slo-mo"" button.  He also rather blatantly copies the defiant-demigod-who-doesn't-believe-in-the-gods-because-they're-mean-until-he-totally-needs-their-help dynamic that was forefront in ""Clash of the Titans"" and ""Immortals,"" which comes across as hollow and simplistic.

Admittedly some of the ""Gladiator""-lite action scenes are decent, but the movie falls into lurching lethargy as soon as they stop. Both fights and romantic scenes are hopelessly wooden, and the dialogue is the sort of tin-eared kitschy cheez that boggle your mind (""In my mind's eye, where your face has been etched since the first day I saw you"").

And Kellan Lutz... oh, Kellan Lutz. He speaks with the charisma of a dead seal and the intensity of a constipation victim. He looks like he's straining his acting talents whenever he's forced to speak more than five words in a row, and you can practically hear the wind whistling between his ears when he tries to be righteously outraged. This role needed a Chris Hemsworth, and instead we got an Emmett Cullen.

Most of the other actors are either blandly generic (Weiss), two-dimensional (Garrigan) or engaging in frothing scenery-chewing (Adkins, who seems to be channeling Nicolas Cage). The mighty and passionate goddess Hera is turned into a whining, crying wimp. The only person who gives a semi-decent performance is Liam McIntyre, who easily outshines Lutz.

""The Legend of Hercules"" leaves you pining for Kevin Sorbo or longing for The Rock -- a cheap-looking, inept disaster of a film that fails in basically every way. Only watch it if you've already bought the Rifftrax.",1390176000,11,4081,5.250384024577573
6167643,1,B00HLSW6YC,"I just came back from wasting couple of hours of my life. Where do I begin sharing my disgust? First, the script seemed to have been written by couple of second graders. No plots, story line or dialog worth mentioning. Second, it was terribly acted. I don't think I can recall any movie I have ever seen where every character was just this terrible. Given the material one can understand actors inability to portray the character well, but I am still puzzled how not even one of them managed to do their job properly, which leads to  Third, the worst directing job Ive seen in a very, very long time. If I ever failed at my job so completely, I would try hiding my connection to the project.

And with all of these I would have still talked myself out of writing this review (which I do rarely these days), if it was not for the most mind blowing reasons why I think this movie was completely bad. In big budget blockbusters likes of which this film was trying to be, special effects are the main attraction. But in this case they were are so bad, so dated I cant help myself but wonder if they actually spend any money making this movie? 15 years ago this could have been acceptable, maybe. But with the technology available today, this was unforgivable. To give you one example: in the beginning of the film the title character and his brother come face to face with a killer lion. And when the lion actually showed up on a screen every single person in the theater laughed. We actually laughed. There was nothing redeeming about this movie and if you are still considering buying the DVD do your bank account a favor and wait until it is available for a $1.00 rental from red box. I promise it will still be a waste of money.",1390176000,6,1728,4.38006230529595
6167644,1,B00HLSW6YC,"I'm not going to get into what it's about or who stars in it or who directs it (although when Renny Harlin's name poppped up in the end credits, it all seemed to come together).  Suffice it to say that my standards can be relaxed to almost any degree, but I'm not going to bow for this movie.  I just got home from seeing it a few hours ago. and my first instinct was to warn the rest of the world not to spend their $10 on it.  ""Hercules"" is horribly acted, barely plotted and ineptly directed - a big budget CGI mini-epic with barely any story, few recognizable characters and no memorable dialog.  The story seems to have been written with as much wit as one of those now loved Italian sword-and-sandal movies of the early 1960's but without any of those older films' campy fun.  This ""Hercules"" takes itself way to seriously but the story moves in incomprehensible ways - one minute he's a slave, the next Hercules is a freedom fighter. About the only thing your mind will understand is why they had to rip off better stories (you know that there's a ""Gladiator"" riff there).",1390089600,7,1079,4.402010050251256
6167645,5,B00HLSW6YC,"A Renny Harlin-directed historical-fiction epic laden with CGI is exactly what humanity has been yearning for in the past few millenniums. I can hardly begin to describe to you the epicness that this extraordinary film beholds, the same way that you can hardly begin to even fathom. Renny Harlin, Finland's finest, has returned with a mighty vengeance since his WWE powerhouse film 12 Rounds. Here, he quarterbacks this excellent demi-god film revolving around a young Hercules who stands up against an evil tyrant who is being a complete menacing-douche. Along the way Hercules goes on a radical adventure all throughout the beautiful Mediterranean. The dudes will love the action and the adventure, the ladies will love the hot romance and the abs. Strap in your seat belts, ladies and gentlemen! This movie is the ride of a lifetime! 10/10",1390003200,4,842,5.0647482014388485
6167646,5,B00HLSW6YC,"Great movie. Started slow, but the pace quicken up. This is a great movie for those  who have an intret in the greek gods",1390003200,6,121,4.041666666666667
6167647,1,B00HLSW6YC,"Theres been no shortage of films portraying the mythological Greek hero, Hercules.  Sadly, nearly every single one of them is either embarrassing and/or outdated to the point there isn't really a film to point at and say  thats the best Hercules movie.  Some could make a case for the Disney animated feature from 1997, but other than that, Hercules has been best defined by Kevin Sorbos portrayal of the character in the television show, Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.  And, if director Renny Harlin thought he was the man to reinvigorate the character in his film, The Legend of Hercules, then epic fail applies here.

In The Legend of Hercules, Kellan Lutz stars as Hercules, the son of Zeus  the father of the Gods.  The film begins with the introduction of King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins), as he easily adds another kingdom to his empire.  He is a bloodthirsty man that will do anything for power, a trait that his wife, Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee), finds to be revolting.  She prays to the Gods to put an end to this Kings rule so there may be peace.  Understanding what she is asking for, she is then impregnated by Zeus  and prepares to have a child that the king knows full well is not his own.

Flash forward many years and Hercules (who goes by another name that the king picked out for him) is in the middle of a tryst with Hebe (Gaia Weiss), the daughter of a king from a neighboring rival kingdom.  However, she has already been promised to Hercules diabolical brother, Iphicles (Liam Garrigan).  Naturally, the brothers become at odds with one another, prompting the king (who shows favoritism towards his one true son) to send Hercules off on a mission of war that is doomed to fail and lead to his death.

Aware that hes has an uphill battle to contend with, Hercules is desperate to return home before his brother marries his true love.  Along the way, he must face down an army, slavery, various battles, and eventually, his own familys hatred towards him  not to mention the unexpected realization that hes the son of the most powerful God of them all.

Doesnt that sound exciting?  To some, it might actually sound appealing.  Well, shouldnt buy into it and don't you dare waste a single second thinking about watching this monstrosity of a movie.  The odds are usually going to be against a film succeeding when a sub-par director, like Renny Harlin, signs on to helm the project.  After all this is the guy thats is most notable for directing films that include A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master, Driven, and 12 Rounds.  The quality of those particular films speak for themselves and provide enough information to know this Hercules film is not to be taken seriously.

If the directing wasn't bad enough, the acting doesnt do this film any favors either.  Leading man Kellan Lutz, who some might recognize from his small supporting role in the Twilight films, might look buff and ready for action  but terrible action sequences and mediocre visual effects really kill any ability for Lutz to show his acting skill.  For reasons behind understanding, not one single role was given to a major Hollywood player  limiting the films advertising capabilities and general appeal to a wider audience.  Its difficult enough for moviegoers to invest their time and money into major films (who have an above average chance these days of being terrible) with A-list actors, so apparently the people behind this film didn't learn very much from 2011s Conan the Barbarian debacle (which also starred an unrecognizable leading man in the lead).

Unfortunately, theres absolutely nothing (and I mean nothing) about Lutzs character that makes you care about him.  These characters, along with Luzs love interest, portrayed by the forgettable Gaia Weiss, are completely devoid of emotion  and if you need proof (the poor folks out there that have seen it know what Im talking about), then look no further than the shrug-worthy villains.  Both King Amphitryon and his son, Iphicles, attempt to be grandiose, but simply appear to be just as cheesy and unbelievably annoying as the good guys.  Frankly, each and every one of the characters could either live, die, or become bean farmers for all I care  just as long as I never have to watch this movie ever again.  If you couldn't already tell, this is one of those generic hero-worshiping movies where the good guy lives and the bad guys die  meaning the only question that viewers will be asking themselves is how long will it take to get through it all and to the credits?

Overall, The Legend of Hercules starts out badly, gets worse, rips off Gladiator (in cliff note fashion), and eventually ends on a terrible note (featuring one of the dumbest and most mishandled endings in quite a long time).  More often than not and with every passing scene, this film is a great example of how to waste a lot of money to make a monumentally poor film.  Not only is it poor, it lacks authenticity, mind-blowing effects, and characters with heart.  However, the only thing that stops this movie from being a complete and utter failure is the appeal that it might have for young boys in the 8-year-old range.  Sure, this film is violent, but its actually tasteful violence that plays out just as a Saturday morning cartoon would  meaning theres no blood, gore, or abusive language.  In fact, the three stooges might be more violent than The Legend of Hercules.  In any event, I know its only January, but I have a feeling this movie winds up on a lot of peoples worst films of 2014 list.

Yes, it differed significantly from Hercules mythology (most notably Hera) but if you take it on its own merit, it was good, consistent, and realistic; surprisingly, despite tending to be a purist myself, I kind of liked the divergence, as it put a slightly different spin on the story and movies sticking strictly to the mythology have been done to death. I also like how they kept him literally a son of Zeus and gave him supernatural powers (which would only make sense as a demi-god), when many Hercules movies keep him strictly mortal and maybe being stronger than normal. Second, the acting overall was good, with Lutz a pleasant surprise. Most big guys are cast based on body and have ZERO acting ability. However, Lutz is definitely different than the norm, and shows a full range- not the typical stoic/plastic look most big guys show. His shock, rage, then grief and worry over Hebe's wounding was particularly well done. He also consistently shows the optimism and hope his character is trying to encourage. Definitely gets to shine here vs his meathead role in Twilight. Third, the sets and costumes were great.

Overall, this movie far exceeded my expectations given Its rating. Recommend watching, if you can cast your preconceptions aside.",1475625600,12,1444,4.893877551020408
6167692,2,B00HLSW6YC,"Greek Myth is an interesting subject, and movies and writers have tackled it in the past, and some have done a good job. But this one was a let down. Did they draw anything from the Greek Myth? If so, I missed it. They rewrote the myth as far as I can tell. I was very disappointed in the movie, the actors, the plot, and the dialogue. It was just a movie with pretty scenes. I did give it two Stars for effort.",1475625600,,411,3.963855421686747

6167699,5,B00HLSW6YC,"I don't understand why people don't like this movie. People make fun of this movie because of Kellan Lutz simply because he was in twilight and that some how diminishes his acting ability. Those people are just idiots. Put aside you petty viewpoints; take a look at the movie without bias.  Look at the original Hercules with Arnold Schwarzenegger; he didn't even speak one work it was a voice over dubbed in because he didn't even know English!  Versions after that had mechanical birds, and lots of other computerized creatures.  So if you are going to make fun of one you should take a hard look at everything you watch because everything that is scifi, action, animated and the like has computerized components to the movie.

Now my personal review of the movie is spot on! It is gives a fantastic version of Hercules as true hero. There are great battle scenes, romance, and intrigue. Mr. Lutz did an excellent job because Hercules is supposed to be extremely handsome, a giant in physical stature, great agility, a warrior and mad skills. Mr. Lutz's voice was not out of character, showed depth, passion which left me rooting for him the whole way through.

If you truly appreciate action movies, scifi, and mythology then this combination will leave you happy with the movie.",1472601600,5,1282,4.782805429864253

If you decide to move forward in sitting through this torture, the first thing you will have to get over are the Rob Liefeld proportions of the lead.  Who knew that was possible... Please do not cast this guy as any Marvel or Image character just because Liefeld knew this was possible before any of us did.  So if you can get through that, then comes the poor acting.  I mean seriously... this is not Shakespeare, just deliver the lines in a coherent manner...  I'm telling you, that was asking too much.  Now usually, if you know you've got piss poor actors, filmmakers usually try to give you something pretty to look at.  The actress was scrawny and neurasthenic, so I definitely looked elsewhere, only to discover that the cinematography was just as uneven as the story.  There were some great locations... they were not maximized.  And the special effects...  I've seen youtubers do better on no-budgets.

It does not follow at all the Greek mythology. In fact, I was reading another review and he was true, it looks like a mixture between Sanson, Thor, Spartacus and Gladiator, but not to Hercules.

Acting is bad and cheesy. Script is bad and does not have any logic. It has cheap special effects. It seems like Hollywood movies are becoming more and more like Chinese movies where heroes and villains flight in the air. Nowadays, all heroes flight in the air and are experts in martial arts from  Conan to Hercules (funny how old Conan  version can be very slow but not bad at all compared to the newer version or to this movie for that case).

Watch this movie under your own risk, it seems like a cheap budget TV movie or something that you would watch during a Svengoolie show ;)",1419292800,,807,4.425675675675675

6167865,4,B00HLSW6YC,"THE LEGEND OF HERCULES

The story of Hercules has always been a popular one for any story teller in any format. The mythical character has portrayed many times from film to TV. My personal favorite of course is Kevin Sorbo from the Television series from the 90s, love it. So since it has been a while since they have made a movie about him it made sense that two would come out recently around the same time. This is the one directed by Renny Harlin and starring Kellan Lutz

The story follows Hercules after he is sent away by his earthly father and set up in an ambush to die. You see his father is still jealous after walking in on his wife making said Herc many years earlier. Now that his blood son wants to marry a young woman who is in love with Hercules he sent him off to die. But Hercules has the blood of Zeus running in his veins and vengeance is coming with him.

I have to say that despite what a lot of others are saying I actually really enjoyed this film. Sure I don't really like the slo mo thing and there are times that it is really misused at times here but over all I liked this movie. I think Renny Harlin did a good job with this film, you may know him as the guy who directed films like 12 Rounds, Deep Blue Sea, Die Hard 2, A Nightmare on Elm St. 4 among many others I have enjoyed. He also co wrote this film along with three others and while the dialogue is not all that great and they do not stick to the actual mythology it is still decent.

Acting wise I really didn't think Kellan Lutz did a bad job; you may know him from Immortals, the remakes of Prom Night and A Nightmare on Elm St. along with the Twilight films. He looked the part and played the part well enough. Also Scott Adkins who played his father on Earth did a great job as he has in various Van Damme films. Everyone over all did a good job on this film despite the issues with the script.

Now while this film was going for a 300 thing like others have pointed out if you can get by that it really isn't that bad. Turn the brain off, grab some drinks and just sit back and watch this flick. Also on the Blu Ray you get a great commentary with Renny and Kellan and a nice making of feature. So with that said I think while the film would get a three the Blu Ray would bump it up to a four. Over all this was a fun flick that is not meant to be taken seriously.",1417996800,,2358,4.008510638297873

6167923,3,B00HLSW6YC,"Not to be confused with Hercules (2014) starring Dwayne Johnson.

In The Legend of Hercules Kellan Lutz (Emmett Cullen of the Twilight saga) plays Hercules, who, betrayed by his cunning stepfather King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins), is forced to live the life of a gladiator, fighting in the arena. The story sounds a bit familiar, doesnt it?

Well, this is an epic origin story (according to the homepage of Millennium Films) of the famous demigod. With the (too) fast-paced story and flat characters, the film seems not very interested in the Hercules lore. Yes, the Nemean Lion, clearly digital, appears, but its combat scene with Hercules is bland and generic.

The Legend of Hercules is directed by Renny Harlin (his first 3D film), who back in the 1990s gave us such enjoyable films as Die Hard 2 Cliffhanger and The Long Kiss Goodnight. These action films are loud and illogical, but fun nonetheless. Even Cutthroat Island. a big commercial failure, is not that bad.

In short The Legend of Hercules wants to be an action-packed sword and sandal film, but lacks something that would have made it a fun film. Perhaps the film needs better acting and script, plus more budget, and most of all, style and originality that would have made this Hercules tale more entertaining.",1411171200,,1275,4.888888888888889

6167930,3,B00HLSW6YC,"What a interesting display of responses to this film in the review department - from caustic loathing to unabashed adoration and everything in between. But look at so many of the television series that act out similar tales  - lots of blood and guts, sex, absurd dialogue, subpar acting, etc - that are picked up season after season because audiences love the escape form reality mode. Go figure....

No, THE LEGEND OF HERCULES is not a great movie; it is a diversion. Does it stick closely to the myth of Hercules? Who knows? A myth after all is a myth and we've swallowed a lot of versions of this story before (remember Steve Reeves, etc?). But now it is in competition with Marvel comic heroes and space odysseys and a lot of other mindless time wasters that make it to the big screen because of the return of 3D. They succeed for the trill of dodging the special effects that make you scream.

Short summary form the PR: `The origin story of the mythical Greek hero. Betrayed by his stepfather, the King, and exiled and sold into slavery because of a forbidden love, Hercules must use his formidable powers to fight his way back to his rightful kingdom. In Ancient Greece 1200 B.C., a queen succumbs to the lust of Zeus to bear a son promised to overthrow the tyrannical rule of the king and restore peace to a land in hardship. But this prince, Hercules, knows nothing of his real identity or his destiny. He desires only one thing: the love of Hebe, Princess of Crete, who has been promised to his own brother. When Hercules learns of his greater purpose, he must choose: to flee with his true love or to fulfill his destiny and become the true hero of his time. The story behind one of the greatest myths is revealed in this action-packed epic - a tale of love, sacrifice and the strength of the human spirit.' Make a lot of dramatic sense? No, not really.

The main attraction of the film is the quite often barely clothed vision of megahunk Kellan Lutz as Hercules. His acting is up to the minor standards of the script, but it is his body that the audience pays to see. Toss in Liam  McIntyre (television's second Spartacus), Johnathon Schaech, pretty Gaia Weiss, Rade Serbedzija, Scott Adkins - all television favorites - and the cast carries off this rather ponderous plot rather well. The CGI effects and the arrested and slow motion photography add to the circus and there you have the reason for making the movie - to see a lot of Kellan Lutz and a lot of blood and gore that seems to be the diet of preference for moviegoers. Watch it for fun and relax on the flaws. It is entertainment after all. Grady Harp, September 14",1410566400,2,2639,4.489583333333333

The story was so simple, yet such a failure.  They do no characterization.  There is no reason to care about anyone.  No clear motivations.  Then they force-feed us action scenes that try so hard to look like 300's.

We have to care first for any violence to work, dum dums.

It is easy to figure out this movie was meant to be shown and watched in 3D.  Several very good scenes would have beem greatly enhanced had they been seen in 3D.  Certainly the combat scene towards the end of the movie would have been more interesting.",1405382400,,420,4.56
6168064,1,B00HLSW6YC,"Slaying the Lernaean Hydra?  Cleaning the Augean Stables?  Capturing Cerberus the three-headed guardian of the underworld?  Those are mere childs play compared to the labor of sitting through the Legend of Hercules.  Lou Ferrigno can now breathe easy in the knowledge that he is no longer the star of the worst Hercules movie ever made.  Considering films like this, the Clash of the Titans remake and its sequel, and the 2011 film Immortals, the Greek people may regret ever recording their mythology.

Queen Alcmene, wife of the tyrant King Amphitryon (Adkins) prays to the Goddess Hera for aid.  Hera appears to her and tells her she will bear the son of Zeus and he will be the savior of her people.  Cut ahead 20 years later and Hercules (Lutz), named Alcides by the King who knows he is not his son, is now a young, powerful man.  His older brother Iphicles constantly berates him and even takes full credit for killing the Nemean Lion in a CGI created sequence that makes the average Syfy network film seem cutting edge by comparison.

Hercules and Iphicles are both in love with the same woman so his father gets rid of the competition by sending Hercules off to a military campaign in Egypt.  Hercules is joined by his friend, Captain Sotiris (Liam McIntyre of Spartacus).  Their troops are ambushed leaving only Hercules and Sotiris alive as they are captured by Tarak (Schaech) leader of the Hoplites.  Tarak sells the pair into slavery where they are forced to fight for their lives in the gladiatorial arena.  The pair wins their freedom and return home where Hercules must finally embrace his true lineage as the son of Zeus to gain his full powers to defeat the army of his father.

For star Kellen Lutz, he must likely be thinking he never wants to hear anything about Greek Mythology again as he has the misfortune of not only starring in this film, but also in Immortals.  Lutz at least looks the role but thats never been much of an issue with Hercules films, even going back to the Italian-made sword and sandal epics of the 1960s.  Lutz finds himself lost when he has to carry the action himself.  Fortunately McIntyre helps him out a good deal although I am sure he wishes he had retired his sword after Spartacus ended.  And for the record, Hoplites were NOT Egyptian soldiers but another faction of Greek soldiers but I hardly think historical accuracy entered the equation at any point during this film.

Despite the many battles in the film its PG-13 rating renders it nearly bloodless to the point of absurdity.  The gladiatorial fights are particularly tame and thus laughable despite Director Renny Harlins over usage of the 300 style of super slow-motion action.  One wonders where the $70 million budget went as the visual effects and cinematography are equally horrible.  Four different people are credited with writing the film and you can only assume that they did so independently without seeing what any of the others wrote due the disjointed narrative.

For Harlin, who once upon a time made a couple of decent films (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, Deep Blue Sea) it is another low point in his career which seemed like it could get no worse after the horrible Exorcist: The Beginning in 2004.",1405382400,,3224,4.736559139784946

6168085,4,B00HLSW6YC,"This is the most chaste sex-and-sand (that's what they used to be called) movie I've seen lately.  In fact, there's only one scene in which two people get together and they're both fully covered by sheets. These Greeks even swim fin their chitons.  There's a general re-working of the Hercules story of course because the actual legend was full of sex. It seemed all the mighty Herc did when he wasn't killing someone or something was grab the closest woman and ravage her so this story  has been greatly sanitized. In this version Queen Alcmene agrees to have Zeus' child to free her people from her husband Amphytrion's tyranny. (Like Zeus needed his wife's permission...although supposedly Alcmene was the last human female Zeus ever coupled with, which may mean something.) In the original story, he wanted Alcmene. She repulsed his advances so he took on her husband's form (a la Uther Pendragon in the King Arthur legend) and stopped the sun in the sky so the night he spent with her actually became three nights (whew!) Alcmene names her son Hercules in an attempt to placate Hera, even though it wasn't her fault but it doesn't work because almost everything happening to the child is caused by the vengeful goddess-wife.  Not in this version. Now Hera's working with the other woman.

 Anyway, Hercules is born and we jump ahead twenty years to the expected sibling rivalry. Hercules loves Hebe who's betrothed to his half-brother Iphicles so of course he has to be gotten out of the way by being sent to Africa with a poorly manned outfit to be dispatched by hired assassins. But is he...?  Of course not!  He, with the single survivor, makes his way back home for VENGEANCE.

There is a singular lack of special effects in this one and very little ""godly"" ones.  Zeus appears only as a whirlwind, which, according to some of his other manifestations as a bull and a shower of gold, is pretty tame. Having him appear as another Amphytrion would've been much better (and they wouldn't have had to hire a second actor for the part). There's a Samson-lookalike scene with Hercules tied between two temple pillars which immediately set up the idea he's going to pull them down. (He does.) Every fight scene is a done deal.  SIx...twelve...no matter how many men they throw at him, he takes them on single-handed and wins...with slo-mo stop-motion effect...and he made it look so easy. No worry at all there.

All in all, it's a good movie. It just isn't what one expects from a movie about the greatest of the demi-gods, the superhero to end all superheroes. Granted, this is about ""young"" Hercules before he has his ""Labors"" and all the other really dramatic stuff but the absence of the gods and the reworking of the story into a cliche leaves much to be desired.  Go into it expecting a nice little fairytale and you'll be OK. I'm giving it four stars because I did like it though it was a lackluster.  Now I'm off to see the ""other"" Hercules film starring The Rock, which theoretically takes up where this one leaves off.",1404950400,,3031,4.68361581920904

""The Legend of Hercules"" is a $70 million cheese-basket loaded with ho-hum special effects and a low-voltage cast of Hollywood back-benchers (Kellan Lutz, Gaia Weiss, Scott Adkins, etc.).

The movie purports to tell the story of the famed demi-god/son of Zeus, who also happens to be the strongest man in the world, but very little that makes its way to the screen has anything to do with the actual myth of Hercules as it has come down to us through the millennia.

I know this is necessary for people who have 3-D. Does this mean TOUGH LUCK to the rest of us who have no intension of replacing everything we own with 3D equipment? I hate 3D it triggers Migraine headaches so I cannot view movies in this format. I always buy both to get the digital copy. I have no use at all in having a 3D copy of this Movie.

First is when Hercules enters a pit of merciless cage fighting - shirtless, of course -- expected to kill or die in front of a crowd of wagering, drunk barbarians; and in the middle of the cacophonous din some guy in the audience shouts out, clear as crystal, ""Hey!  He's cute!!""

Second is right after the fight, where Hercules and his undefeated buddy are informed they must duel to the death two other undefeated fighters, ""Half-Face"" and ""HumBaba"" (name alone makes me chuckle).  Hercules looks at Half-Face with a stern, confident stare.  Half-Face glares back with a maniacal grin.  Music crescendos.  Camera pans to Humbaba, just staring into space.  Then some wimpy little guy off to the side shouts out ""What, these two?  You have nothing to worry about.  You cut off his head, he wouldn't get any dumber"".

6168166,2,B00HLSW6YC,"I happen to be a lover of GOOD movies about ancient Greece, Rome and the accompanying legends I myths.  Unfortunately this is
not one of them.  And the title is wrong: his name is HERACLES, not Hercules; Hercules is the god-mans Roman name.  Anyhow,
there is no legend in this film except as to how Herk was born.  Zeus indeed is his father though Hera was not too pleased with his
fooling around with the Greek chickeepoos, but hey, when you are MR BIG or the BOSS. who is going to argue with you.
  The sets are quite good including the Lions Gate, Photography good, the architecture faithful for the time period, and the costumes
accurate though the Greek men did not wear Togas.  The cast is ok though I did not think the princess was very pretty; Herks brother
was cuter and I am not gay.  The original tales of Herk was not present in the film and the story seemed to be based more on
GLADIATOR than the classic myths.  And the Greeks did not like or engage in gladiatorial games like the Romans until late in
the 3rd Century AD. They did however engage in some very rough sporting games, such as boxing with hard leather gloves.
Still, the film is kind of fun, but I did not like the slow motion inserts. like when Herk was swinging those paper mache boulders
all over the place. I only gave it two stars because of the weak story; the cheap Steve Reeves films had better stories.  I liked the
man who played Herk; he certainly looked ""Herky"".  And the Special Effects were effective.  Though the battles seemed to be
inspired by ""300"" style of direction, the noticeable lack of blood suggests this film was being geared more for the youth than
the adults.  Hey, come on, I love sword and sandal stuff, especially with all garbage coming out of the other studios.  It is refreshing
to me to see goodness and niceness win over EVIL.  Take that, Max. Smart.  But put more thought into the story, producers, if
you make any sequels.  I got this like all my other DVDs from Amazon.",1402790400,4,1984,4.406593406593407

6168168,3,B00HLSW6YC,"Ok, the worst thing about this movie was the main character- nothing but nice pecks and a reasonably good-looking face. No acting ability or even force of character to really draw you in. That said, the movie itself was not bad. If you don't expect it to be even remotely similar to the Hercules myths, you won't be too disappointed. Fight sequences are pretty good and effects are 300-ish.

6168174,1,B00HLSW6YC,"A friend and I rented this the other night because we were looking for a cheesy action flick, and we were not disappointed. I am reminded of a phrase that I read in a Rolling Stone review years ago that described someones acting as so wooden you would have to edit it with a chainsaw. That phrase could be applied to much of the acting in this movie, particularly by Kellan Lutz and Gaia Weiss (Liam McIntyre would be a notable exception to this; he did a good job with a poorly written part). Lutz really needs to learn how to move his facial muscles because the bland stoic pretty-boy look really doesnt work for most scenes.

The plot? Well, the names of three of the characters--five if you count the Nimean Lion and Hera as characters--come from the common Hercules mythology, but other than that, the writers have taken great liberties and concocted a new story completely. Which wouldnt be bad if the story were good. But its not. And the action is a combination of CGI, wire work (perhaps), and weird stop-motion almost-cartoonish action similar to that seen in the movie 300 (which was an excellent movie). Really, old-fashioned clay-mation (think the original Clash of the Titans) would have fit the tone of the movie better.

That said, if you're into silly movies, this is the one for you! We got it from a Redbox so we were only out $1.20 for it, which is just about right.",1402444800,2,1386,4.54

This had all the earmarks: a great legendary tale of a great legendary hero (think Achilles), dazzling graphics (think Avatar), virtually real special effects (think Gladiator), powerful acting and credible action series (think 300), a dream made real on film... how could it go wrong? Well, start by not telling the legendary tale of the legendary hero - make one up from scratch. Then, use special bargain-basement effects with obviously layered graphics. Use actors who have trouble defining their character in the lame-ass story with no real roots, I almost turned this embarrassment off and asked for my $$ back - but it's not Amazon's fault - they're just providing streaming content.

6168206,5,B00HLSW6YC,I have to admit. I was really impressed with how the whole  HERCULES legend/story was put into an up to date 2014 movie with outstanding special and visual effects being careful not to over Do It so it still made you believe its validity to be truly real. In my opinion I liked it and believe a sequel with same actors would definitely have my attention if it ever happens. Writing this makes me want to watch it again. Lol,1401494400,,423,4.2875
6168207,4,B00HLSW6YC,Hercules is really the Incredible Hulk of Greek Myth and this Hercules is more of the hot sweetheart kind of Hercules.  Honestly my main problem with the film is that Hera did not get enough effects.  I did like her giving marital advice since she is the goddess of that.  I don't see why everyone hates this film that much.  The fight scenes seemed a lot more Greek and less like Kung Fu than some films I've seen on Greek Myth.  The costumes were closer than most but really this is an over the top action Greek Myth film so what do you want.  You know war you are getting when you press play so I don't see why people are complaining so much.  It was fun.  I liked it.,1401408000,,671,4.107692307692307

6168209,3,B00HLSW6YC,"This is one of those movies you should show off your 3d tv with, but then maybe not, as you might not want your friends knowing you brought this picture. The 3d is almost perfect, it's bright, highly detailed and really impressive to look at..the movie itself, however, is pretty poor. The picture might suffer from the fact that it's director is famous for creating the greatest box office bomb, infact he hasn't made too many good movies. Or the picture might suffer from the fact that there's no one in it..there are no ""stars"". Hercules is played by a man who just doesn't look the part. Oh, he's big and he's got muscles, the only problem is every time you see him, instead  of seeing Hercules, you see a kid from Boston who ""woke up"" and found himself in Iraq fighting as a Marine...he might even make a good CEO in some wall street movie, but he just doesn't look like a Greek hero. In fact not too many people look like they belong in this movie...it's completely miscast. Then there's the story..it has one, just doesn't have anything to do with ""the Legend"" of Hercules nor has it anything to do with history, just that old worn out tale of ""boy gets girl, boy losses girl, boy gets girl back"" and along the way he kills a few dozen people, including his father and his brother...should be exciting, but it just isn't. The fight scenes on the whole are pretty good..remind you of a cross between ""Troy"" and ""300"" a lot of close ups and stop motion..one big difference..no blood, so the kids can watch... that is if they can stay awake. If you like your 3d, then there's plenty of ""eye candy"" here and if you're one of those who needs to get drunk to watch a movie..then this is for you..if not..maybe you'd be better off watching commercials.",1401408000,,1752,4.440993788819876
6168210,2,B00HLSW6YC,"The brainiac who envisioned making a movie about a normal, average Hercules is likely regretting that decision now. There are a few moments where his mythological origins are hinted at, but otherwise he lacks his famous superhuman power and does not embark on a series of legendary and fantastic adventures.

In this ""legend,"" Hercules is a good-looking guy, who has some things happen to him as an excuse to set up a few ""300/Gladiator"" style slo-mo swordfights, though seasoned veteran director Harlin is capable enough to elevate the proceedings to something slightly better than a straight-to-video movie with his shots and pacing. There are a few impressive scenes that were clearly designed for 3D in your face. But the overall story is very pedestrian in its ambitions and proceedings, as the movie plays in an unremarkable and familiar cliche of a wronged man's quest for vengeance and justice.

The lead is somewhat wooden, and his clean-shaven face and short haircut does not fit the role well either, as he resembles more of a Roman politician than a rugged Greek warrior. But it's not really his fault he isn't given much to do other than look pretty but tough throughout the whole film.

I wanted to think, when I selected this video, that a hot guy and the age old story of Hercules would be enough to carry this movie or at the very least make it decent. But sadly, I was wrong. Lutz was attractive and sympathetic, but there was nothing else to capture the attention of the audience. The graphics were mediocre and the plot a little redundant. In a nutshell....there is an obnoxious King who shuns his younger son (Hercules) because he believes that he isn't his father (which of course is true, he is the son of Zeus). The King is callous and mean to Hercules at every turn and instead showers his greedy/treacherous/sniveling older son (Hercules' brother) with attention and even supports his attempts to woe Hercule's love interest, the lovely princess. There are several twists and turns in the story that includes betrayal and treachery, peppered with a few love scenes...but other than that, it all fell a little flat. Would I recommend this movie? Well, this would have been the perfect movie for the Sci Fi station (it was even a little campy).

6168286,2,B00HLSW6YC,"I at first didn't believe that a movie about Hercules was being released, and  I was curious enough to watch it on DVD, The people behind THE LEGEND OF HERCULES had something grand in mind that failed miserably. It's not all bad. It's just not good enough.
HERCULES tries to have the look and feel of the STARZ series SPARTACUS. There are mild similarities in the action and fight scenes, but they are mild and few and far between. A cable channel made a series far beyond anything seen in HERCULES.
That leads us to Kellan Lutz as HERCULES. Yes, he is muscular and good-looking but can he act? There was something mechanical about Lutz as Hercules and most of the cast seemed to just be an inconsequential part of the sleepy action.
For most of the movie, Hercules is just a normal human with extra muscles. Only when he finds out he is the son of the god Zeus does he realize he has a greater purpose in life. Here is a man born to a mortal woman and a god and whose destiny is to save his people from domination. Does that sound like another man we know? The comparisons to Jesus seemed fairly obvious toward the end...though our Hercules is more mortal and has a love interest.

The myth deviates early as the story line follows a brutal king and his slave queen who has just conquered ARGOS. The queen is desperate to save her people from further blood shed so she makes a pact to conceive a son and although he known as by his Greek name to the populace he is of course Hercules the son of Zeus. Who ever wrote the screen play must have had an after thought and tried to inject some part of Hercules' legend because the Nemidian Lion makes and appearance and of course Hercules kills it. Don't expect too much more where his legend is concerned because then it gets to be a little Helen of Troyish when he falls in love with the princess of Crete but must stand by while his older brother if betrothed to her. Although they run away, they are brought back and Hercules is sent on a mission that is doomed from the start. He is taken prisoner and fights his way back home in an attempt to regain his kingdom and the princess before she is married to his brother. The fight scenes are good but they pull the slow motion effects ala 300 during many of his fight scenes.

The story at first gave me the impression that it was going to be an epic and amazing movie. Even the movie cover sucked me into renting this movie on the Red Box. However, when the story took off and it left me thinking of 300 and Gladiator except in a very bad way. The scene with the Lion looked fake and unoriginal, the fight scenes showed no blood, which is horrible considering the way they were fighting. Really!?!?!

With that said, the buff guys and sexy main female character made it at least worth the 3 stars. I did like the costume designs and there were some parts of suspense.

Trust...this is not the worst movie in film history. You all know this. Now of course I do have an issue with films being set in ancient Egypt or the Mediterranean and Hollywood's fear of casting brown people. But in the end it had action and beefcake! The end.

There's no real struggle throughout the movie other than actually sitting through the whole thing.  The special effects are laughable at best.  And the actor that plays hercules is probably one of the worst actors i've ever had the misfortune of watching on screen.

Hollywood has been messing with Greek mythology and ancient history for
decades now, so it does not bother me that I now see that Hercules did spend some time
as a gladiator.
It is just that is a really boring movie, a b-movie all the way.
Even if you like this kind of movies (and I do), with the fighting, the men with
the hyge six packs and the really sexy queens, it is still difficult to watch.
I hope that you will rent it for a while, because you cannot watch it all at once,
it will take you 3-4 days....
The acting is bad, the plot is worse, but it is an action movie with swords and
fighting so you expect all that. But still, it is not all that fun, and it is just
a bad copycat of the 300 and especially of the Gladiator.

6168351,4,B00HLSW6YC,"Based On all the negative reviews posted here, I originally was not going to order The Legend of Hercules, but then thought better of it for two reasons: 1) Amazon offered it at a great sale price; and 2) some of the reviewers complained that it didn't show enough gore or blood in the battle scenes, which is, to my way of thinking, a plus and not a minus. So I ordered it.

Im glad I did. I found it to be a fun adventure film in the mold of the old Italian fusto films, but with much higher production values. If you are expecting a great piece of film art, you are of course going to be disappointed. If you just want a fun sword-and-sandals pic, it does just fine.

First off, the film is visually stunning. I don't know why others were complaining about claustrophobic sets, but the visual elements of this movie are quite impressive, the sets, costumes and CGI effects (although I find it amusing that a generation is growing up thinking that CGI is more realistic looking than older film effects, when in fact CGI merely looks like CGI). I only saw the DVD in 2-D, but I get the impression that, if it was executed well, it would be quite a knockout in 3-D.

Other reviewers are correct that the sudden lurching into slow motion is painfully overdone. It is one thing to highlight a particular momentsay, the death blow to an important characterthrough the use of slow motion, but it happens so frequently and arbitrarily throughout the film you get the feeling someone was sitting with their hand on the slow-mo button and just would switch it on at random, with no consideration whatsoever of what was being shown. And during the final battle sequence, it gets absolutely ridiculous. Another minor gripe: the teeth of the hero are made to appear so white that even when his face is in shadow, his teeth look like glowing neon Chicklets.

Unlike others, I don't see the acting as being so much wooden as in an intentionally archaic and pompous tone common to many films set in ancient times; certainly it is preferable to the more naturalistic acting of the Kevin Sorbo television series, which intentionally made the characters sound like modern-day Southern Californians. Is the acting worthy to be compared to the great performances of Laurence Oliver, Marlon Brando or Robert de Niro? Of course not. Is it any worse than the acting of former fusto actors Alan Steel, Reg Park, Mark Forest, Lou Ferrigno or even the most iconic of all Hercules actors, Steve Reeves? No. Is the plot (which admittedly is a nonsensical jumble of elements of the real Hercules myths and total fabrications the writers pulled out of their butts) any more absurd than the plots of Hercules Against the Moon Men, Son of Samson, or Medusa Versus the Son of Hercules? Hardly. And the visuals are head, shoulders and pecs above any of those antecedents.

So if you are a fan of the old muscleman films of a day gone by, youll have a good time watching this. If you're looking for intellectually challenging, thought-provoking drama that effectively delineates the eternal human condition, the title alone should have tipped you off that you're barking up the wrong tree.

This movie was a complete waste of the $3.99 I paid to rent it through Amazon.  They tried to make up for terrible acting with action scenes that were in slow motion.  All that did was make it last longer, it didn't make it better.  Kellan Lutz should have been able to pull off Hercules, he certainly had the physique for it, but I just never connected with his character.  The love of his life was just silly.

6168363,1,B00HLSW6YC,"Nine Things about the Movie The Legend of Hercules (USA, 2014)

1. This is surely the most misnamed movie of the year. It has absolutely nothing to do with the real Hercules myths.

2. This is basically just another generic gladiator movie, except the names of the characters are taken from Greek mythology. Youve seen this movie before. Multiple times.

3. Its about a power-hungry, violent king named Amphitryon who takes lands just for the gold and the work he can get out of the people. His wife, Alcmene, thinks hes pretty much a worthless dick. She makes a pact with the goddess Hera to have sex with her husband, the king of gods, Zeus. She wants a son to take out Amphitryon. Hera agrees to help Alcmene, and says the boy Hercules will be the savior of the people.
(In the real story, Zeus just takes Alcmene because he wants to, and Hera hates Hercules so much that she tries to kill him and makes his entire life miserable).

4. Hercules is born, and falls in love his brothers girlfriend, Hebe, so he is sent to die on the battlefield. He survives, is sold into slavery, and becomes a gladiator. He tries to get back to Hebe before she marries his brother. Blah blah blah.

5. Hercules spends all but about 10 minutes of the movie being just a regular man. He doesnt believe his mother when she tells him hes the son of Zeus. Its not until he is in trouble and cries to Zeus for help that he gets a burst of extra strength. Then he just throws boulders around or whips people with lightning for a minute.

6. The fight scenes are a straight rip-off of 300. I admit they are cool to watch - as long as you aren't tired of the slow motion pecs-and-swords thing.

7. A lot of the special effects seemed kind of cheap. Even Zeus, who could have been badass, is... invisible. Seriously. The scene where Zeus impregnates Alcmene is just Alcmene moving her arms and legs while the bed sheets swirl around.

8. You can tell a scene is dramatic because theres either a lightning storm, or else weird snowflakes float through the air, even when its warm outside.

9. If they made the movie about the real legend of Hercules, This could have been something. Instead, its a bland, unoriginal piece of crap that I forgot I had watched by the next day.",1399766400,,2249,4.413043478260869
6168364,2,B00HLSW6YC,The only reason I watched this is because I'm in love with Kellan Lutz!  That's it!  The story line is slow.  The acting is sad and it was just bad.  So glad it was rented and not purchased.,1399766400,,190,3.9210526315789473

6168370,4,B00HLSW6YC,"Ok I have to make this clear right from the very start. It's a 3D movie in 7.1 surround and there is no other way to watch it. I've read review after review of how people hated the movie but I discount the morons because they watched it in 2D and/or stereo. You might as well watched it in black and white with the sound turned off because you just missed half the movie. Then I have to add this: Have you ever seen a really great Hercules movie?......... Even Disney couldn't do it!
 Once again we get the Spartacus/ 300 slow motion effects but far less gore. Something I've never thought was realistic or necessary. Give me blood yes, but don't spill 300 pints from one guy and spray down the camera crew too.
 I had a few issues with the story line being rushed (more likely edited out for time), some bad acting and disconnected continuity but it was a love story wrapped in testosterone with an actual happy ending (not often do we get one of those in this genre).
I went along for the ride and I was never bored. This is not Gladiator with 'A' list actors and one of the best Directors in History.
But you already knew that by the tittle. It's more on the style of Troy.
We all watch these movies for the special effects and this movie doesn't disappoint.

6168372,4,B00HLSW6YC,Now this one wasn't too bad it had some good action scene it was a decent storyline storytelling I meant only thing I had to complain about that movie Hercules Busby's all-powerful but he kept beating up towards the in it got pretty good for a few minutes then he got beat up again and he find beat the bad guy. So to give this a rating out of five stars I would have to give it 4 1/4 stars it will be out five stars if Hercules didn't get beat up all the time but this how they told the story can do nothing about it. Am I buying it if I can find it cheap enough by people won't agree with my review but this is my own opinion lot people said it would be no good but the story wasn't too bad so I enjoyed.,1399680000,,706,3.777027027027027

It's a fresh take on hercules and filmed similiar to the 300. This is by far no low-budget film.

I was glad to see Kellen Lutz expand his acting abilities and it has a great cast of actors some well known others are not but will be.

The 6 of us sat around hoping it wasn't going to be another typical take on the myth and to our surprise it wasn't,
That in itself made it enjoyable to me ""the unexpected""

I couldn't believe the amount of negitive effort so many reviewers put itno thier review of this.

Sit back with the mind-set "" ""forget the actual myths"" and you're in for a treat.

When I'm in the mood for a doc made upon facts. I'll watch it with that mind-set.
This movie doesn't claim nor imply that.

If you enjoyed SPARTEN, the 300 you will enjoy this very much.

Nonetheless, this movie plodded along, the dialog was drearily boring, and Hercules..? The actor (who is plainly a graduate of the Kirsten Stewart/Keanu Reeves School of Acting) playing him looked almost identical to all other male soldiers in the movie. Didn't Hercules have muscles that made him a bit more imposing than his ""peers""? It is rare I have to turn a movie off 3/4 of the way through, but, honestly, sleep seemed more exciting than this movie. I'm giving it two stars only for the CGI, which they at least made an effort at turning this stinker into something watchable. It's probably good if you catch it for free on cable in a few months, but this is yet another film from which I wish I could get both my time and money back.",1399680000,,904,4.451807228915663

The script lacked any kind of imagination, the casting and acting were largely pathetic and the actor who plays Hercules is so bad that it is almost laughable.  The CG work, while somewhat okay, is wayyy behind the curve when compared to works such as Avatar and The Life of Pi.  The stop-frame technique used over and over again during the fight scenes becomes predictable, boring and silly after about the second fight.  It's as if the director thought it looked so cool that he decided to use it EVERY TIME there was a fight and there are plenty of those.  Sheesh!

1.  The ""plot"". The movie is more about the romance of Hercules than actually fighting.  (Nobody watches Hercules for a love story).
2.  The acting is pure awfulness. ( I'm not sure if that is a word but this movie deserves a new word for bad).
3.  The graphics look like something off of a MySpace page from the late 90's.
4.  The corny factor.  Even Chester Cheetah thinks this movie is way too cheesy.
5.  I was charged $3.99.  I fell like the movie company owes me $43.99 now.  $3.99 for the movie and $20.00/hr for watching such  crap for 2 hours.  I deserve to be compensated for this.

You should save your money and not purchase this. If you must see it then just rent it. There is a lot of action but one of the favorite special effects is slow motion shots of Hercules fighting. It is not very impressive.

I thought it couldn't be that bad and for 3.99 I thought I'd check it out.  Perhaps it was so bad that it would be funny in the same vein as some Mel Brooks' movies but I wish it were that good. I rated it ""One Star"" because I couldn't rate it no stars.  The names of the stars, cast, and production staff appear to be people I invited to my Bar Mitzvah 56 years ago and I recall that to be 5 of the longest hours of my life.  The most redeeming value of this film?  It made me consider that my physical at the induction center was a lot more fun than I considered at the time.

It was my personal opinion that the damsel should have died at the end and Hercules went on to do his father's bidding.  But... No... Even after being fatally stabbed the damsel lives on to give Hercules a child and they live happily ever after.  There is a good amount of action that carries the feature from one scene to the next.

6168481,1,B00HLSW6YC,"I had really high hopes for this film. Unfortunately I came away very disappointed.  The story is a painfully lazy ripoff of Gladiator with the writer or writers making a very half ass attempt to slip in the fact that the main character is Hercules. There is absolutely no character development throughout the movie.
Now what really destroys this movie is the horrible special effects. I'm still waiting for Hollywood to abandon the 3D fad, but for now we have to deal with a handful of poor attempts to wow audiences with random objects flung at the screen. Very few movies, if any, manage to pull off 3D effects with any level of success without looking silly. And this movie is not one of them. Right from the start, this film suffers from an obviously small special effects budget. The giant lion that Hercules kills looks like a cartoon character. In fact, much of this film looks like a cartoon It seems as if they spent all the effects budget on the few 3D effects and somehow managed to get those terribly wrong. The blocks of stone that Hercules rips from the pillars he is chained to, look incredibly stupid as they are flung at the viewer. Those chains must be magic because while they appear to be about 6 or 7 feet long when Hercules is standing between the pillars, they suddenly grow longer and longer as the scene progresses. Did I mention how stupid this whole scene looked?
And then there is the acting. With so many scenes involving actors attempting the sort of ""over the top"" acting that worked so well in ""300"", but just comes off cheesy and stupid in this film. Scott Adkins attempts, very poorly, a king Leonidas impersonation in virtually every scene that he is in. Pretty much screaming every line he has. As for Kellan Lutz, all I could think of throughout the entire movie was the Planet Fitness commercials with the muscle head who kept repeating ""I pick thinks up, and put them down"". It's difficult to tell if he was instructed to act as if Hercules was an idiot, or if that is the only way he knows how to act.
There is just too much wrong with this movie.",1399161600,9,2088,4.494736842105263

Hercules as a story has been done many times before both as a movie and in television.  Unfortunately for this movie, it has been done much better before.  With poor casting, poor acting and overacting and herky jerky filming with its gratuitous use of slow motion (almost felt like I was in a Matrix movie.), this movie almost felt B-grade quality even though it had a 70 million dollar budget...  I mean like seriously 2 decades pass and Queen and King don't age a day? You couldn't actually add some makeup to make it believable that two decades passed??

Some of the fight sequences are ok but the way it is filmed (what the heck is that stuffed lion looking thing??)just annoyed me and gave me a headache instead of being truly enjoyable and the characters and actor choices just didn't work for me.

6168489,3,B00HLSW6YC,"Hello. Just got done watching Hercules. First off I was want to say overall it's not that bad of a movie I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if I could. I was tempted to give it 4 stars just because it picks up the last half hour and starts to come to life. I liked the ending for it's special effects and cinematography. I just wish the whole movie felt like the last half hour or so. So it's better than mediocre because there is a lot of action , the story / plot is there, and the characters and actors all do fine. With that being said I don't think kellan lutz makes a good Hercules. Sure he's buff but I just wasn't feeling him as a strong role for Hercules. I might like the ""rock"" better haha. But yea all in all I enjoyed the film, I felt like the overall decency was there, the special effects were there, but it just didn't have that wow factor. That ""x"" factor we all crave in a movie. Good effort but it fell short of legendary quality (barney Stinson. Should you pay to see it? I would not recommend it. Get it on redbox or wait til it's out on hbo or something.

If you don't look at this as a ""Hercules"" movie, then it is a mediocre Greek love story.

The fact that the writer turned a Greek Demi-God story full of adventures and legendary battles into nothing but a ""love story"" was enough to make me turn my stomach...
The acting is pretty bad, and there is little to no character development.  Hercules has none of his legendary powers and is portrayed as a love-stricken, single minded regular guy who's whole world revolved around one woman.

As said above the story plays out like the stars TV series of Spartacus just not even remotely as gory. Now for the part I'm sure some of you really want to know about....the 3D!!!!! The 3D in this movie is easily hands down the best 3D i have ever seen with this style of movie. Comparing it to the immortals,clash and wrath of the titans and Pompeii. There were tons of pop out in this movie. The opening scene has lots and lots of arrows coming at you so well it makes that spear scene from star trek 2 look like amateur hour. Tons of scenes with raining ash and other things like dirt and dust just seem to sooth it's way from in screen right into your home...Bravo!!!! The depth was fantastic from long shots of the sea to up scaling castles and  when they go into the forest you really get the feeling you are hiding behind a tree and watching it happen first hand.

Ok, the Hercules in this movie looks more like I would envision a Hercules to look like. They even got the olive tan skin look too.
Hair, muscularity all good.  Even face looks like he came from the statues.

Too much:
love scenes with pretty girl; too much emphasis on this relationship

Not enough Hercules:
the power stuff was mainly in last 150-20minutes, not enough really.

Special effects;
quite minimal

The plot with brother and father was sketchy and random.

Pros:
most good job on camera
it felt like ancient Greece
For the plot I think this Hercules was good.

Cons:
This Hercules didn't have good acting support;
Too many un-Hercules type scenes
Maybe can The Rock and put this Hercules in the movie?

P.S.
People should be aware that there is a bigger production of Hercules coming out (sometime 2014) and it will be played by 'The Rock'.

I have several issues with 'The Rock'
1) he doesn't look Greek.  He's Samoan.  How can they honestly think he is a good match to be a Greek? Seriously?
2) All Greek statues of Gods and Athletes are muscular, but not the blow up, gross, disfigured look of current Rock.
3) Rock will have long darker hair, this also go against Greeks which had shorter hair. None of statutes had longer hair

Rock is way too disfigured with is radical body building. I liked him better when he did Walking tall, or movies earlier.
I skipped his latest movies where he looks like a total meat-head. Sometimes around 2009-2010 he changed into super pumped up hulk - very gross and displeasing, He was perfectly fine before the big pump.",1398816000,,1601,4.575438596491228

If you liked 300, and many of the other stories told about Greek heroes, Greek Gods, and Half Gods,  then The Legend of Hercules is right up there.

Without going into too many spoilers, I can tell you the basics. Betrayed by his ruthless stepfather, Hercules is sent into battle, to die, but is instead, sold into slavery, because of his fighting will, (and 3 or 4 arrows.) Far away from his love, who has been betrothed to his half brother, Hercules must overcome these obstacles, and stop denying his birthright, as the son of Zeus. Then fight for honor and love, from a slave fighting in the small mudpit origins of gladiators, to champion and freedom at a great Greek arena. Will he accept his birthright, and draw on his half-god powers?
The story is well written, acted, and produced. The soundtrack envelops you for the journey as you really around the charming champion of this story, which essentially is how Hercules came into this world, on screen. The special effects are grand and will have you dodging and weaving, in your seat.

The story is longer then most, but it's well with the journey.",1398556800,2,1150,4.711442786069652

I swear some bits of the movie Gladiator made it in here as well. The cgi lion looked ""interesting"". It was a valiant effort at reviving one of the better epic stories from Greek literature....

After the King announces a wedding between his son and the woman Hercules is in love with Hercules is sent off to fight a battle that is doomed to fail and kill all involved. After surviving and learning the truth about his life he vows to return to his home and fulfill his destiny. I will open by saying that I have never been a big fan of these types of movies. That said, even if I was a fan I don't think I would have liked this movie anymore then I did. This is really nothing more then a mix of every movie of this genre thrown together into one big generic mess.  It really felt like a spoof type movie where  20 different movies are combined to make one new one, but this was without the comedy. The biggest problem I had with this movie though is that to keep the PG-13 rating they had to sacrifice some things...like blood. When you see a 5 minute fight scene that looks really brutal and you see the person die dramatically then you see the body and it looks like nothing happened at all the effectiveness of the scene is lost. Again though I am not a fan of this type of movie so if you may like it if you are a fan of 300, Conan, Immortals, The Eagle, etc...you may like this as well. Overall, hard for me to get into.

6168579,1,B00HLSW6YC,"Before I get into the mess that makes this movie so dang terrible, I have to give it credit for one thing; it made me laugh. I do not believe I have ever laughed so hard in an action movie before this film, or for such a random reason. The sword fights, which have the whole ""look how powerful we are swinging these weapons around"" vibe and sound effects, often hit the floor and just sort of stop and wobble. It's also worth a laugh when you first see the Nemean lion. I mean, just look at the truly awful CG lion. I doubt that you would believe that the budget for this film was $70 million after seeing it.

Unfortunately, that is where the fun really ends. There is no Hercules mythology present in this film at all. In fact, I wonder why the film is even called the Legend of Hercules, considering all the borrowed myths and legends from other sources. Let me give you a few examples; at one point, Hercules brings down two pillars that he was chained to after praying to the Greek god Zeus. A few minutes after this, he summons lightning from his sword to become an electrical whip to use against his enemies. These sounds awfully close to the Biblical Samson legend and the Norse god Thor's lightning ability. In fact, Hercules only rarely (and by rarely, I mean like three times in the entire film) demonstrates his legendary strength. Hercules also apparently is not a mortal enemy of the goddess Hera, despite all mythology saying otherwise. I realize that the director can take some artistic liberties in their film, but to call this the ""Legend of Hercules"" and then use nothing from the Hercules myths...that's just wrong. In the end, you'll just be left with a bad taste in your mouth if you watch this film with the hopes that it will be a good Hercules film.",1396828800,85,1774,4.441717791411043

The movie entertained me in general. The lack of blood doesn't really bother me. The action scenes were good. Kellan Lutz looks good but seems to have been on a muscle gainer to get huge. Unfortunately, that makes his face a little heavy and not as attractive as usual.

The main problem with the movie is that it looks too synthetic like anime or a fairy tale. This is partially due to the script which is as developed as an essay by a 4th grader. The sense of reality is further damaged by some of the visual effects that were so badly done that the viewer can easily pick up scenes that were faked in a studio, not out in the field.

The movie and visual effects were produced in Bulgaria - the land of high prices and low quality. No wonder that the movie budget of $70 Million doesn't really match the cheesy special effects. I wonder how much money did the Bulgarians get for such unprofessional low quality execution. What was the director thinking really ... I am Bulgarian by the way so kind of expert on the topic ...",1395705600,7,1160,4.336405529953917
6168590,5,B00HLSW6YC,"Minor spoilers will ensue.

First and foremost, I have wholeheartedly admired Kellan for his dedication in the industry amongst the years. From an outside stance, I've noticed tremendous growth, which I believe is often blinded by closed-minded individuals who seek only people who have already spent years acting to the point of portraying practically any character perfectly, or people who assume that because an individual is young and enjoys dabbling in different facets of profession, such as modeling, fashion and merchandising, alongside acting. By the same token, an overwhelming quantity of individuals neglect to offer young Hollywood a chance to prosper without judgment or harsh criticism, which in a sense I view as deplorable.

This movie was not the best, but I admire the expressed effort and dedication that the individuals in this movie played to their roles, and I don't know what is considered top-notch, pristine acting, but this is an action/love film and I bought into what acting they offered. The movie's intention seemed to provoke fun and stimulation, not a reason to screw on your analytical caps and hope you at least grasp the plot. Not everything is meant to cookie cut to the Oscar standard. That's boring.

Albeit being outwardly attractive, Gaia Weiss partially agitated me in this film; I just felt that her constant presence was arbitrary and the way that the aspect of love was portrayed incredibly dampened the gravity of this film. I don't understand how she stabbed not only herself but also another man and still lived, yet Hercules' mother died almost instantaneously from a similar stab wound. Obvious favoritism of character. However, cheesy love story aside, the adventure aspect and fight sequences allured me. I value men who can grunt without making me feel uncomfortable in the theater and throw punches that don't appear fake. The slow motion effects were handsome. Also, I enjoy that while Hercules was inevitably deemed to succeed, the other men, Sotiris especially, struggled tremendously with every battle and required constant aid, which emphasized the concept of persevering despite grave adversity and remaining loyal to friends no matter the circumstances. Of course middle-aged men with broken dreams of being an action hero, or some big shot in a hyped up film similar to the Expendables, would denigrate this film entirely, without sparing a single chance or smidgen of hope for the main character. I've viewed movies that involved Kellan Lutz over the years and although they are not the absolute best, I have noticed and continue to witness vast improvement as his career advances and he works hard to achieve his dreams. At least he's found the guts to face his endeavors head-on, aware of the brutality that will arise from people who behave mercilessly towards new actors or actors who simply want to prosper. Not everyone's perspective of Hercules will be the same. Disney of course did not follow the legend to a T, this did not offer an exact replica of the old tale, but it portrayed how one director's perception of Hercules and which traits and facets of the tale should be emphasized and altered for entertainment. People have the right to freely express themselves and should not be scrutinized for doing such. I will continue to watch Kellan's movies and even give this film a second and maybe even a third glance, because I believe in him, I don't dwell over vampire films and typecast people as if they can't accomplish anything else, or make fun of someone's appearance and use that as adequate base for a movie review. I found this to be a great film overall and again appreciate the effort placed into it. Even if the movie did not overwhelmingly appeal to all audience members, I feel that it at least deserves three stars. Who are we really to judge below that standard? But again, as this opinion derives from my perception of things, to each their own.",1395273600,3,3936,4.9787234042553195
6168591,1,B00HLSW6YC,"Hercules has always been a popular subject for movies. So after Greek mythology-themed fantasy movies like ""300,"" ""Immortals"" and ""Clash of the Titans,"" it's not surprising that Hollywood would dredge him up again.

Unfortunately, they cast the meathead from ""Twilight"" as Hercules. And the terrible casting is only one of the problems in ""The Legend of Hercules"" -- it feels like a cheap TV movie version of an actual blockbuster movie, with claustrophobic sets, random eruptions of slow-mo and uber-cheesy dialogue. Even worse, it cribs from the earlier Grecian myth movies while lacking even a shred of their style.

Repelled by her power-hungry husband King Amphitryon (Scott Adkins), Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) makes a deal with the goddess Hera: Zeus will have sex with her, and she will have a son named Hercules who will destroy Amphitryon. Yeah, because Hera was always okay with her husband boinking human women. Amphitryon, suspecting the baby isn't his, names him Alcides.

Two decades later, Alcides/Hercules (Kellan Lutz) is in love with Princess Hebe (Gaia Weiss), but she's betrothed to his wimpy brother Iphicles (Liam Garrigan). They try and fail to run away together, and Amphitryon punishes Alcides/Hercules by sending him off on an undermanned mission.

Of course, the undermanned mission gets slaughtered, except for Hercules and his buddy Captain Sotiris (Liam McIntyre), and they are quickly sold into slavery as gladiators... because yeah, they had LOTS of those in ancient pre-Romanic Egypt. Hercules' superhuman strength allows him to free himself and Sotiris, but he must somehow seize his father's kingdom before his brother weds Hebe... or something like that.

""The Legend of Hercules"" really feels like a TV movie knockoff of a blockbuster movie, or maybe a halfhearted TV pilot. It certainly doesn't feel like a movie with seventy million dollars behind it -- everything feels very cheap and lackluster, especially since they apparently have no sets larger than my living room, and the special effects are mostly confined to bad lightning flashes.

Of course, director Renny Harlin doesn't help matters. After all, this is the guy who gave us movies like ""The Covenant,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 4,"" ""Cutthroat Island"" and ""Exorcist: The Beginning,"" so he directs like an amateur who has just figured out the mechanics of film.

For instance, the movie has random bursts of slow-motion -- not the climactic parts of fights, but horses leaping over logs or Hercules tossing a dead body away. It's like Harlin keeps dozing off and accidentally pushing the ""slo-mo"" button. He also rather blatantly copies the defiant-demigod-who-doesn't-believe-in-the-gods-because-they're-mean-until-he-totally-needs-their-help dynamic that was forefront in ""Clash of the Titans"" and ""Immortals,"" which comes across as hollow and simplistic.

Admittedly some of the ""Gladiator""-lite action scenes are decent, but the movie falls into lurching lethargy as soon as they stop. Both fights and romantic scenes are wooden enough to give you splinters, and the dialogue is the sort of tin-eared kitschy cheez that you would expect of... well, whatever the ancient Greeks had instead of chick-flicks (""In my mind's eye, where your face has been etched since the first day I saw you"").

And Kellan Lutz... oh, Kellan Lutz. He speaks with the charisma of a dead seal and the intensity of a constipation victim. He looks like he's straining his acting talents whenever he's forced to speak more than five words in a row, and you can practically hear the wind whistling between his ears when he tries to be righteously outraged. This role needed a Chris Hemsworth, and instead we got an Emmett Cullen.

Most of the other actors are either blandly generic (Weiss), two-dimensional (Garrigan) or engaging in frothing scenery-chewing (Adkins, who seems to be channeling Nicolas Cage). The mighty and passionate goddess Hera is turned into a whining, crying wimp. The only person who gives a semi-decent performance is Liam McIntyre, who easily outshines Lutz.

""The Legend of Hercules"" leaves you pining for Kevin Sorbo or longing for The Rock -- a cheap-looking, inept disaster of a film that fails in basically every way. Only watch it if you've already bought the Rifftrax.",1395187200,202,4282,5.273127753303965
