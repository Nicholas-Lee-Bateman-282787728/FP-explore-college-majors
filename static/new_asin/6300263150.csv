288562,1,6300263150,"One of history's worst movies ever created.  Its hard to believe actual human beings made this, because it appeared as if this was produced by wild apes and the script was written by a  80's rock and roll baboon.  A speculative logical explanation could have been that these actors and directors must have been taking a ton of illegal drugs during production.  This film is total trash from start to finish that it's almost totally comical the sheer level of badness it stoops down to.  This is low hanging fruit entertainment for the absolute lowest common denominator of our society.

 If anything this is a period piece for television and movie art students to review as an example of humanity's worst, and what never to create as artists.

 Plot: Rock and roll weirdo and loser guy stalks and hunts pretty girls in his band, then comes up with a plot to go on stage and slaughter more folks, particularly half dressed maidens chained up next to heavy metal 80's musicians.

 If you want laughter and an example of just how bad the horror films were in both the 70's & 80's, then take a look at this garbage pile.  As a youth I remember garbage level movies and shows like this one, and today I can only speculate the rational as to just why heavy metal music, weird 80's rock, violent cheesy horror films, and bizarre images of Satanism were so popular and appealing back then.  The genre had ultimately slipped away into total oblivion over the years, leaving history with the question ""why?"" and with an example of pure pathetic depravity in the process.

288564,1,6300263150,I just received my Rocktober Blood. I was under the impression that the VHS was new and never played. The box is damaged. It took DVDposterVHS several weeks to receive it. I had to complain to DVDPosterVHS several times to get it. They then sent me the wrong tracking numbers as well.,1402963200,2,284,4.480769230769231
288565,5,6300263150,"Ok so maybe my rating for Rocktober Blood is a bit biased do to my love for metal music, but it is still a great addition to the Horror archive. The film itself did not deliver like I thought it would but the band most certainly did. Their is not much else to say about this film really. If you like metal, buy it! If you like cheese with your horror, buy it! That simple!",1369526400,2,372,3.973333333333333

They usually state that in their listings, not for this one though.
Oh yeah the movie is cool too, like 31/2 - 4 stars if you like the 80's cheese fest.",1505692800,,265,4.428571428571429

Video quality is pretty rough, but price was very cheap so oh well. Pick up Black Roses or Trick or Treat (86) instead.",1503187200,,289,4.37037037037037

7807943,1,6300263150,"Yup, the others are correct, this is simply a VHS-rip, so the quality is just bad.

However, I could forgive the quality if the movie wasn't so bad. No, not so bad, simply unfinished. SPOILERS ahead. Though, there's honestly nothing to truly spoil.

I thought the movie would be about a rock singer that comes back from the dead to kill people, but the movie instead opens in a completely inexplicably manner with a band rehearsing, everything is going swell and then the lead singer leaves the studio, walks back inside and kills a couple of people for ZERO reason. It then jumps two years later saying he's dead--though this was never shown at the beginning. In fact, in the beginning he escapes...?

So now, the movie slows to a crawl as this guy ""comes back from the dead"", though there's ZERO context as to him coming back from the dead as he's dressed/looks/acts the same he did at the beginning and it never showed him die. From here, not a lot happens until the very end when everyone's on stage and Billy--the villain--gets hit in the head with a guitar and just keeps singing... And then the movie ends...? What?

The movie simply isn't finished. It jumps around with no context, does nothing compared to what the awesome cover suggests and in the weirdest part... Has a strange mini-documentary about dogs and hobos (?) tacked on the DVD after the closing credits... Honestly, I didn't even listen to it as I was fast-forwarding because the time code said that--even though Rocktober Blood ended--that there was still 20 minutes of post-credit content. What on Earth were they thinking?",1491350400,4,1597,4.733812949640288
7807944,1,6300263150,"If I could give this piece of excrement a 0 Star review I would. Transfer is COMPLETE garbage. It is a VHS Rip. Period. Save your time, your money and your sanity by skipping this altogether. I have a VHS rip of this from VHSPS already.....somehow their audio quality is better than this ""official"" release and the PQ is pretty much the same. (VHSPS have retained the Vestron VHS box art so they win there as well) I hope the Sebastians have a hello come to Jesus moment SOMETIME and sell the distribution rights to a competent distributor who will actually restore this film, do a real 2K or 4K transfer and give this movie the proper release we have all been longing for.
