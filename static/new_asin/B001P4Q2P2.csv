8332073,4,B001P4Q2P2,"This movie is great if you like artistically creative, spoofy, campy, goofy movies.  Although the special effects are not the worse I have ever seen, if you are looking for that Hollywood shine and sheen then skip this one.  As you can tell I liked this movie because it was unconventional.  Also the music in it is fairly good.  The music spans from Hill-Billy rock to Tech 9.  It isn't the greatest movie I have ever watched but it reminded me of the 1980s style of movie that promises hope and confidence in the world and people around us. The fact that it spans from Joplin, Missouri to Malibu, California added to its charm by giving it and its characters the perspective of a mid-western town and its people.  I might add that the acting is good as well.  Coming from the Mid-West myself, I had a laugh at the swatting of misquitos here and there in the movie, that the movie makers left in intentionally.  I really wish someone would make more of these kinds of movies.",1415318400,,976,4.443820224719101

8332076,4,B001P4Q2P2,This movie was really under rated. It's not Baseketball by any means but it was really funny. Definetly worth buying especially considering the low price.,1290211200,,154,5.2

I got this move for two reasons really and those would be because the great Techn9ne is in it as is Preston Lacey from ""Jackass"" who also made this flick. This is an interesting movie and is really not for everybody because it is a little off at times. Still there will be those who get it or are just completely amused by it, I think I fall some where in between those two. This is Presto's second movie following his National Lampoon assisted flick ""TV the Movie"", which I like more then this one. I guess I am leaning towards the TV one but Tech is in this one. That is right rapper extraordinaire TECHN9NE is in this film, how sweet it is.

This is a film about a film or a film about a fake film or something like that because it is well; it is a strange flick to say the least. Lucky is a very strange guy who lives with his father inside a cave and sets people on fire to win races. Yes you read that right this guy goes way beyond cheating, oh did I mention his neighbor is a caveman or something like that. Well a documentary crew takes a look at this guy and says to themselves we need to film this guy. They end up getting some really entertaining footage as well as some very different footage as well. But the film ends up tearing the crew apart as well as Lucky and his life, sounds like a good time right?

Well it is good at times and downright awful at others but still the funny moments are laugh out loud. Some are actual funny moments while others are just so odd they make you laugh. Writers Preston Lacey and director Sam Maccarone really got creative with this one but it does not always pay off. They are also in the film as the filmmakers but if there is one saving grace other then Techn9ne it is Dian Bachar in the role of Lucky. He is a very quirky and entertaining guy and really pulls this crazy character off very well. Still I must go back to Techn9n3 as he is the main reason I bought this, he does not have a huge role but he does have a fun one.

This is far from a perfect movie or even a great one at that but it is very original and needs to get points for that. This is a fun flick and a very weird one at that so who knows you may be really into this. I thought it was an interesting film and an even better idea so who knows maybe if executed properly this could have been a classic. For an independent flick it is very ambitious and original.",1248739200,,2412,4.050314465408805
