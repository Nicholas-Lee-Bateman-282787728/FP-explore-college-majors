3105587,5,B0013F5L0K,"My Dad had just bought a sailboat, so I got this for his birthday. He loved it. He had been trying to learn on YouTube but wasn't getting anywhere. He learned alot from this video. I wasn't happy with Amazons shipping, though. It was late.",1267660800,,239,4.333333333333333
3105588,5,B0013F5L0K,I bough this for a friend of mine and we watched it together. I didn't have to answer any questions. Great movie for a beginner sailer.,1261440000,,135,4.230769230769231
3105589,4,B0013F5L0K,This was a good basic sailing DVD. It covered most everthing. Only complaint was that it could've been a little longer.,1255219200,,119,4.714285714285714
3105590,5,B0013F5L0K,I don't understand why people are complaining about production value.  The production value is on par for an educational video.  The lessons are great.  He goes over all the important methods very thoroughly.,1242432000,8,208,5.242424242424242
3105591,5,B0013F5L0K,This is a very good Sailing video for beginners. The theory is well explained in a classroom setting and then in practice. It was very helpful for me.,1240185600,8,150,4.392857142857143
3105592,5,B0013F5L0K,This DVD is an interesting mix of classroom an actual hands-on demonstration.  I felt that it was worth the cost and time.,1235174400,2,122,4.545454545454546
3105593,1,B0013F5L0K,"Although copyrighted 2008, the poor 1980's style production values of this DVD distracted me from learning the material.  I'm surprised that in an era when one can produce broadcast quality programming on a notebook computer, the ""Show Me How"" group has put out a product less sophisticated than an average high school production studio.

The opening titles are a harbinger of things to come. Instructor Gary Cusimano's name is spelled Cusinamo.  How did this slip past the editors??  Gary's presentation is dull and poorly scripted, if it was scripted at all.  Standing in front of a dry-erase board obscured by the reflection of two studio box lights, he pauses frequently and awkwardly as he composes his next thought.  The loud smack of his dry mouth is unpleasant.

Many of the on-board scenes are ineffective at demonstrating the theory behind maneuvers.  For example, many neophytes, myself included, initially have trouble visualizing wind direction. While demonstrating close-haul to close-haul tack, the on-deck bow to stern camera angle makes it difficult to see what direction the wind is coming.  Just as Gary calls ""helms alee"" and you wait to see which way he pushes the tiller, the camera angle changes to an opposite long shot!  The boat is now too far away too even see the rudder!  When the camera comes back to the on-board bow to stern shot, Gary has dropped the tiller!  How did these gaffes get past the editor?  The edit flow could not have possibly made sense when it was viewed during post-production.

Although the video was an acceptable review of the material I learned in ASA 101, I strongly advise against it as a primary instructional source.",1232323200,8,1674,4.953405017921147
3105594,5,B0013F5L0K,This DVD is excellent!  I am a beginner sailor and feel much more confident in all my sailing abilities after watching this!  The sailing instruction is filmed on a sailboat in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland!  I have crewed on sailboats and own my own laser.  This video has helped me improve my skills for both.  I've even learned how to tie a few new knots.  AND I FINALLY know what an accidental gybe is.  (I hope not to do that anymore) :)  I highly recommend this video - You won't be disappointed.,1221523200,4,503,4.333333333333333
3105595,5,B0013F5L0K,"This is an excellent DVD for learning an overview of sailing, the terminology, and the concepts of how a boat reacts to wind direction. All of the mechanics of actually operating a sailboat are first explained in a classroam setting and then demonstrated out on the water. I particularily liked the fact that Gary does his instruction single handed so you can see how one person can raise the sails, and go through all of the steps of sailing and operating the boat when alone. All of the key maneuvers such as tacking, gybing, etc. are demonstrated several times to reinforce each point. Most of the video is on the water footage. I have viewed two other basic sailing DVDs and this is by far the best and most recently produced (2008) If you watch this before starting your sailing lessons, it will be much easier to learn because you will know what to expect.",1213920000,38,862,4.567741935483871

3105597,5,B0013F5L0K,"I bought a 22 ft sailboat. I have never sailed.  This video is the quickstart quide that I needed.  Luckily, my boat is very similar to the 22' tanzer that Gary uses in this video.  I've read some books but they address too much info and not my boat specifically.  If you are a total newbie like me, on a similar size boat, this is the video you need to get you going.  It gave me confidence to get out for my first time.  Perfect.  Big difference between reading and actually seeing it in action.
Thanks Gary.  Nice job on the video.",1339632000,2,534,4.166666666666667
3105598,1,B0013F5L0K,"Don't waste your money on this video - it's poorly done.  The ""instructor"" is boring and the content is terrible.  His seamanship leaves a lot to be desired particularly if you watch the actual sailing portion vs the ""instruction"".  Example: ""Always maintain a 3-point contact with the boat"" as he demonstrates moving around while at the dock.  During the sailing he scurries around like a monkey not holding on to anything.  In several scenes the sheets are left in a large tangled pile on the deck including the last scene where the pile is thrown across the main sheet while he's sailing - and it remains there.  One chapter title entitled ""leaving the dock"" shows him motoring away from the dock.  I expected a discussion on leaving under sail in various wind conditions - a big disappointment to be sure. If I could get my money back based on quality I would - the only thing I can do now is make sure everyone else learns from my experience.",1339372800,6,947,4.568047337278107

3105601,5,B0013F5L0K,My wife and I really enjoyed it and needed this video to take away our fear of sailing. We are beginers and his way of repeating a task more than once was telling us see nothing to it.,1295740800,,184,3.8684210526315788

Sure most of the important points were covered but the effects were terrible, the instructor un-dynamic, the props, diagrams and graphics less than mediocre. (A small hand held sailboat model is not the best way to communicate/demonstrate the parts/maneuvering of a boat...certainly not on video).

8250596,5,B0013F5L0K,Most of my boat time has been on friends diesel powered boats.  A sail boat is more difficult to change direction and it takes more training and experience.  This video is helpful and a good first step in not looking like a complete idiot on my first time out.  I expect to get some advice from an expert sailor who can be bribed with a weekend trip.,1392422400,,350,4.1940298507462686

8250598,5,B0013F5L0K,"Just that I was looking for to help me learn the ropes of sailing. I like tha he was saling along, shows better what has to be done by one or two people other than a crew that is told what to do.",1377475200,,195,3.558139534883721
8250599,5,B0013F5L0K,"I almost let the negative reviews dissuade me from buying this video.  I am so happy they did not!  I recently joined a sailing club after having been away from sailing for 20 years.  While I owned a jib rigged boat it was trailered with centerboard.  My club uses mostly Catalina 22 boats which are very similar to the one in this video.  I went out with the Fleet Master on Saturday, a very experienced sailor, and made my share of mistakes!  I had hoped to see this video first and probably would have not made those mistakes.  But I am frankly glad I waited because this helped me to see what I did wrong (like winding the winch the wrong way).  While the knots he shows are very basic he does excellent job of showing each of these.  And they were same ones used when went out last weekend.

If I had to find a fault (and no introductory lesson is without some criticism about something left out) it would be not discussing the outboard engine.  How to operate it and how to handle it with the tiller when leaving the dock. Simple to note that you point the tiller and the outboard the same direction whether going forward or in reverse. Of course also nice to know where neutral is as well as the kill switch or button. When leaving or when returning helpful to know how to lower engine into or to lift out of water.  And of course the main safety feature the kill button or switch.  Once I got the hang of it I found it quite easy.  But a couple of minutes spent on this might be helpful.  Even though outboards differ a basic introduction would add useful information.  But this omission is being picky as most sailors will get this information on their own outboard (assuming not an inboard engine).  Discussion of wind direction is also a little weak but once more that is picky. Sailors quickly learn techniques of spotting wind direction.  Each boat has its own wind indicators and you will find those quickly without needing much explanation.  It is important to remember this is an introduction to sailing so it is not a detailed set of sailing lessons. For example in strong winds (for more advanced sailing) you need winch handles which he does not discuss but does use toward end of the video.  But once more that is bit advanced.  One more omission is how to safely leave a dock  or how to return under power and tie up the boat.  A few minutes discussion here would have been helpful. Once learned it is not a great trick but for beginning sailors this addition would have been helpful.  These items should not however take away from a very strong and useful overall presentation.

Ok now for strong points.  Discussion of terms and explanations are very helpful.  He does a very good job on this with various tricks to remember certain items such as a beam reach.  His demonstration of tacking helps to explain the commands and he repeats these enough times that a beginning sailor (and crew) will understand and begin to get comfortable with them.  He goes over how to safely jibe several times and this too is helpful.  Plus he shows how to handle single handed, something very helpful for me. His on the water demonstrations I found extremely helpful.

I note some felt the presentation a bit dull or were critical of the production quality.  I did not find that at all.  Nor did I find going from classroom to the boat any problem. Nor the use of model boat for classroom demonstrations. In fact I found the model helpful.  I much prefer a calm presentation to one that I might chuckle at or ""enjoy"" but not get the basics I am trying to learn.  Which, after all, is what this is all about.

As I will be sailing by myself many times his showing how to set up the sails on the water as an individual was very helpful as was his explanation of handling sails by himself throughout the points of sail. There is much to learn about sailing and this is merely an introduction.  But for me it was extremely helpful. I have several detailed sailing books but I got more out of this short series of lessons than trying to absorb more detailed explanations in books on seamanship etc.  And when I go back to those books this video will make the more detailed explanation much clearer for me.  As a result  I have no problem recommending this video to those wanting a basic sailing course.

I will have many people sailing with me who are not sailors and often have not gone out on a sailboat before or for a long time.  I plan to keep this video for them to see before we go out.  I know it will make them enjoy the experience more  and understand what is going on without a lot of explanation from me.  It will be a big help for me to have a crew that understands what is going on and can help me skipper the boat.  Or let them skipper while I crew.  For that alone it is a great value.",1376956800,,4803,4.356981981981982
