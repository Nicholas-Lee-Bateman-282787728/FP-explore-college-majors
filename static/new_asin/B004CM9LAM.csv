8423245,3,B004CM9LAM,"We're familiar with Jodi from her segments on Comcast OnDemand, and both my daughter and I always LOVED doing her yoga. This DVD doesn't really live up (to me, at least; my daughter still likes it). It's very repetitive, and only has one short yoga routine -- not what I was expecting for $20. Oh well.",1403049600,,302,4.410714285714286
8423246,5,B004CM9LAM,"This is a great video to introduce kids to yoga.  One track shows each pose several times, which is helpful for kids who are new to yoga or who have motor planning and coordination difficulty.  There's also an option to skip the extra demonstrations for kiddos who pick up on the idea more quickly.  My daughter and I like to do this video together.",1400284800,,349,4.421875
8423247,3,B004CM9LAM,"The audio on this video is very poor.  I have to turn my television volume up so high to hear portions of the audio and then other parts I have to turn down because they are too loud.  Very inconsistent.  I'm sure it would be a great video for children otherwise, but as it is now, it's not worthwhile having to watch it with the remote at the ready.",1386115200,,350,4.043478260869565
8423248,5,B004CM9LAM,I purchased this for my granddaughter who loves the program Jodi put on for Comcast. I wanted an indoor exercise program for when she can't go outside in bad weather.,1364860800,,166,4.566666666666666
8423249,5,B004CM9LAM,"Jodi Komitor is the most fantastic & dynamic children's yoga teacher that we have found.  While we LOVe taking her classes in person, we're not always able to- and I LOVE that this DVD gives us the option to practice yoga at home!  (Also great for those of you who are not fortunate to have Jodi as a local treasure).

My child is limited with regards to Media- I disagree with plopping her in front of mindless programming- but with Whale Yoga, she is up and moving, participating in the media.  It's media that I can get behind.

Kids love yoga naturally, and Jodi makes it fun, while teaching kids about whales!  The entire DVD is so lovingly composed, with music written just for the DVD, it is clear that true heart was put into the making of this wonderful children's show.",1300147200,3,779,4.450704225352113
