8533817,5,B00916VUMQ,"This was my introduction to Korean Drama. Kept me hooked all 20 episodes. Not only learned about Korean culture
but got to watch beautiful people present a touching story.",1387843200,2,171,4.931034482758621
8533818,5,B00916VUMQ,"I put off watching this after reading the plot synopsis...it seemed like ""same old, same old.""  However, I was hooked after watching just one episode...and upon finishing it, my thought was, ""This has ruined me for all further dramas.""  Simply put, it has a fabulous screenplay, amazing acting (Jung Woo-sung in particular) and amazing directing.  Padam Padam is now my gold standard.  In a more frivolous vein, I finally understand what ""Kim Bum Fever"" is all about!!!",1379462400,4,469,5.0519480519480515

8533821,5,B00916VUMQ,"This is the most heart warming and the best Korean drama I have ever seen. Not only it has my favorite Korean actor (Jung Woo Sung) in it, the story line is so moving and touching. The story teaches you about human being and not to judge a book by it cover. Like the lead character whose been wrongly put in jail for a crime he didn't commit, but people think he did it. When he got out of jail he try to make a better life for himself, his mom, his son and to prove to people that he is not a heartless criminal that everybody think he is. At the end he finally proved to the girl that he love, her dad and to everyone that he is an innocent man and honest human being. Every episode makes me cry because the actors are so good at what they do, especially the lead actor. There's not one thing that I don't like about this drama. I highly recommend this dvd to everybody who loves a great drama whether you speak Korean or not. The subtitle is good, so don't worry if you don't understand Korean.",1357948800,8,997,4.065989847715736
