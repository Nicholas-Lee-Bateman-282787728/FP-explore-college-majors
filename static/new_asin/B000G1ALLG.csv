8128253,5,B000G1ALLG,"This program ""Eastern Philosophy"" (2002) in three parts is more of a survey as it does not have time to dive into the nitty-gritty of each religion or philosophy.  However we do get a different insight than in most of these productions.  I am not sure how they chose the individual Philosophy Experts but they pick people that quite clearly and succinctly can describe each of the philosophies put forward.

This is one presentation not to be overlooked.  Because it is so packed with interesting information from interesting viewpoints it will be necessary to either watch this in small doses or rewatch to find out what you missed while you were thinking about what you did not miss.

The on location footage some being abstract adds immensely to the experience.  There is no noisy background music for the presenters to compete with.",1382659200,2,836,4.852112676056338
8128254,3,B000G1ALLG,"First of all this DVD drifts from philosophy to religion, by starting off with Confucius and ending up with Judaism and Islam in their purely religious form - nothing is said of the Sufis for example, who are a truly philosophical dimension of Islam. The drift to delving into religion stopped, astonishingly, short of mentioning Christianity either in this or in the Western Civilisation DVD. The sections on Judaism and Islam are unnecessarily biased as they are presented by a Rabbi, in the case of Judaism, telling us of that incident where he accidentally switched the light on during Sabbath and, in the case of Islam, by a pleasant looking but rather biased sounding lady, telling us that burgas and chadors are worn voluntarily by Muslim women. All other aspects of eastern Philosophy are presented by objective experts who are generally well spoken - with the exception of a very unfortunate choice in a Chinese chap who stutters and struggles to utter a comprehensible sentence - but who is not nevertheless biased - in the Confucius section. The section on Hinduism is excellent and the section on Buddhism also interesting and informative, given the short period of time allocated to it. I think the sections on Judaism and Islam were unnecessary in the way they were presented and that the producers probably decided to stick them in out of political correctness. This resulted in a poor finish on two otherwise informative DVDs on Eastern (and as part of a set) Western Philosophy.",1163376000,10,1495,4.936507936507937
