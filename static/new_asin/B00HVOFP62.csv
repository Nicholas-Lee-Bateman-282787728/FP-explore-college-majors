8636534,5,B00HVOFP62,"Before Dreyer did his masterpiece ""La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc"", he shot an adaptation of a play called ""Du skal re din hustru"" or ""Thou Shalt Honor thy wife"" by Sven Rindom.

It is the story of Victor and Ida Frandsen, whose couple hits a dramatic low ever since Victor became ruined a few years ago. To his wife, Victor neglects her and doesn't treat her housework with the respect she deserves. With his children, his relationship has worsened and he becomes quite harsher towards them. Every day barking orders and reprimanding everyone for not doing what Victor feels is appropriate in his household, the family's situation changes the instant his former nanny and his mother-in-law take control of Ida and try to set the couple back in order.

A comedy and a realistic drama, Dreyer, to make his movie work, tried to recreate the reality of a real household like in the story. To do so, he recreated a functionable and livable apartment with the proper heat and plumbing. With the characters, he takes precious minutes in showing us Ida's extenuous chores so that we understand how much her work is important, but how, since she repeats those tasks day after day, she and her children are trapped in a poisonous and toxic clock mechanism that she cannot get out of without some help. As such, all the actors give very strong and touching performances, especially Johannes Meyer who did the multi-layered Victor and Mathilde Nielsen as ""Mads"" the bold and decisive Nanny. Speaking of his characters, Dreyer doesn't portray anybody as good or evil. Everyone is on the same foot stand, even Victor whom another director would have treated as an evil figure. Through Dreyer's subtle actor directing, we get a sense of empathy as to how and why Victor became what he is and evolves as the story progresses. When watching the making-of the movie by Dreyer historian Casper Tjorborn, we learn about a deleted plotline regarding Victor's job and how he almost sold the hearted clock in his apartment to make money. Although I know they took out that storyline as it was useless and had nothing to do with the family plot which is the main story, I still wish that they could have given us that deleted scene as an extra in the bonuses. Let's hope one day some film historians find that deleted scene in a cinematheque or archives Denmark. For our pleasure as film viewers and for Dreyer fans.

In its music, The Blu-Ray/DVD plays out the original soundtrack that was chosen for the official 1925 premiere in Denmark, which I think is wonderful as it makes us feel we are seeing what Dreyer originally envisioned for the music of his movie and his audience. Indeed, we have classical music tracks I had never heard before and now love to listen in the background while I work or read. Bioth the original choices and one replacement for the second track, the composer Gillian B Anderson and the pianist Sara Davis Buechner give us wonderful piano performances during this movie.

For its special features, we have a nice leaflet describing the movie from Mark Le Fanu a film scholar, and in the Blu-ray/DVD an essay by David Bordwell on the film's innovations, and another interview from Casper Tyberg who presents the film's production and release history. In it, we learn and see fascinating informations like for instance how, when the film was released for the UK, The British intertitle at the beginning of the movie, naming the characters with English names, has the racist nerve of saying that Victor's character is, and I quote, ""A Spoilt husband, a type that is extinct in this country, but still exists abroad.""
The nerve! The nerve of putting such racist words that weren't in the original movie. As if the UK didn't had its share of mean husbands.

I have to mention and thank the restoration done for this movie as the image quality is sharp both for the Blu-Ray and the DVD. As this movie's almost a century old, it is nice to have this movie still in an excellent quality for future generations of moviegoers. Finally, I would like to say how much I appreciated Batrice Coron's cover for this Criterion's release. Paper cutouts featuring four of the couple's major situations on the front and two in the background, this cover touched me as it reminded me of Hans Christian Anderson's own cutouts he did for his fairy tales. A nice touch for Criterion and which I wish the original release poster could have had such an artwork.

To conclude, a nice movie from Dreyer's silent film era.",1419638400,,4496,4.728316326530612
8636535,5,B00HVOFP62,"The film itself is a wonderful tale of a husband who learns what it means to love his wife and put her above himself. It's also a fascinating look at the way domestic life has changed...and stayed the same. People still take each other for granted, even if both work outside the home. The details might be different now, but the ideas are the same...and that's exactly why Dreyer's film still speaks to us today.

The transfer and restoration efforts are wonderful. Featuring a piano performance of the original musical score, the images are pleasing, even when they're a bit on the soft side. I have a feeling that the different reels of the film were preserved in varying conditions, but that the material which is best has been selected and carefully restored.

If you're a collector of silent film or enjoy domestic dramas, this is a wonderful addition to your collection.",1403654400,6,876,4.756578947368421
8636536,5,B00HVOFP62,"Iconic Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer is probably best known for two works: 1928's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" and 1932's ""Vampyr.""  ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" is considered to be ""The Battleship Potemkin"" of silent film biopics, while ""Vampyr"" is a moody little tale of strange happenings in a village near Paris.

But before these two cinematic landmarks were projected onto silver screens worldwide, came a domestic drama from 1925 entitled ""Master of the House.""  The film, a Dreyer's eye view of working class Danish life, had fallen into relative obscurity and decay until Criterion and other film preservationist groups decided to rescue this worthwhile film.

Thousands of hours were spent in the various restoration processes of ""Master of the House"" and the results are truly amazing. The picture and sound are beautifully sharp and clear, and the new, easy to read English subtitles were taken directly from the Danish subtitles.  All this work by so many dedicated people makes this film not only a must see, but a great addition to film collections.

The music used in ""Master of the House"" is the actual score composed for the film's original 1925 release and was brilliantly reconstructed by composer Gillian B. Anderson in 2000 and beautifully performed by pianist Sara Davis Buechner in 2004.

""Master of the House"" centers on the story of a once proud middle class Danish family suddenly plunged into near poverty due to husband Viktor's business going bankrupt. He is then forced to work for others at low wages, and places his shame and frustration squarely on the shoulders of his long-suffering wife Ida and their four children.

Viktor is a bully and a tyrant in his own home. He treats his caring and hard-working wife like a slave and is cruel and indifferent to his children. There is a smoldering anger that is always just below Viktor's stoic surface, and he constantly looks for the slightest provocation from others to set him off.

While Viktor doesn't resort to physical violence, although he often comes close, he does resort to browbeating and belittling to assert his authoritarian view that he alone is ""master of the house.""  Viktor's real ""castle"" is nothing more than a small, shabby walk-up apartment with laundry hanging around to dry. The family's meager meals consist of thinly-sliced bread with scant butter, wafer-thin slices of sausage, and porridge.

Ida works night and day to keep the family together and is bone tired, yet Viktor accuses her of doing nothing all day while he is at work. The children observe the abuse of their mother and both fear and hate their father.

Then enters ""Mads,"" the steely-spined, old nanny with a heart of gold who works for the family at no charge as a favor to Ida. Mads had been the nanny of Viktor when he was a child and knows how cruel and unforgiving he was then. She did her best to teach him right from wrong, but was not always successful.

When Mads comes around twice a week, she sits on the sidelines darning socks and watching Viktor lord over his family. One day when Viktor's temper creates a crisis in the house and hurts Ida's feelings, Mads has had enough.

She gets in Viktor's face and shouts, ""You may be too big to spank, but you're not too big for me to box your ears."" With that she slaps Viktor's face in front of the whole family.

Viktor flies into a rage and bellows for Ida to ""get rid of that old woman"" or he'll sue for divorce. He tells Ida that Mads had better be gone by the time he gets back from the pub or else.

The family is left in shock, not quite knowing what to do. Mads gets herself together and tells Ida to pack her bags and to go into hiding at Ida's mother's house. Mads' plan is to take care of the children, the household, and Viktor when he returns, whether he likes it or not. Mads assures Ida that she will be the determining factor to tell if Viktor is capable of seeing the error of his ways, and if that doesn't happen, Ida will not return.

I won't spoil the rest of the film by telling too much, but I will say that Criterion's ""Master of the House"" is an enjoyable drama with a few humorous touches, and a Carl Theodor Dreyer film well worth viewing.",1400889600,14,4200,4.60857908847185
