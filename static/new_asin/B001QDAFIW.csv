8335381,5,B001QDAFIW,This is a live concert show and fits the selection as intended. Video production excellent and on a 7.2 rig sounds great. George Jones fans will not be disappointed as he is fresh and upbeat for the audience. No disappointment here except possibly too short. Remarkable will look for others to fire up a cold winter night when you have had it with commercials.,1424390400,,360,4.640625
