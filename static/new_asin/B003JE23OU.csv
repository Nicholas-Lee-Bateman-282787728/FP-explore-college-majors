8398074,3,B003JE23OU,Sarah's voice was a little annoying to me. The yoga starts out too fast. The last half is nice slow and methodical to the end. It seems like she was nervous in the beginning and rushed though til she felt comfortable then the yoga flows better.,1412294400,,244,4.326086956521739
8398075,1,B003JE23OU,I read previous reviews and only spent so much money on a yoga DVD because I thought it would help me like it had others. I didn't care for it at all!!!! The DVD is way over priced for what it gives you which for me was absolutely no results. I bought a Yoga DVD at Target for $12 and got far better results!,1360886400,,308,3.828125
8398076,5,B003JE23OU,"I have found this to be very relaxing and very gentle. It is not strenuous and melts away my stress. I absolutely loved it from the first time I tried it; its actually enjoyable. I obviously had some bound up stress/emotion (I have a high stress job during our high-season, which is April through August)...I ordered this after our high-season ended this year due to some digestive issues and the first time I did it, I had tears rolling down my face the entire time, uncontrollable tears. I didn't feel sad, just a release. I knew then that I had made the perfect purchase and that I would use this DVD on a regular basis for not only my physcial health, but my emotional health. Love, love, love it. Thank you Sarah Harrison.",1354665600,2,727,4.473684210526316
8398077,5,B003JE23OU,I've had issues with my stomach off and on since I was young.  I just randomly searched to see if there was a yoga dvd that addressed digestion and stomach issues.  I found this and thought I would give it a try.  I've been so happy and have found this dvd to be so helpful.  I try to do at least some or all of the dvd every night and have felt a lot of relief from practicing these yoga moves.,1323648000,2,395,3.8395061728395063
8398078,4,B003JE23OU,"Helpful.  Not a lot of bouncing around, more twisting and breathing exercises.  Very relaxing.  Work out is longer, about an hour.",1315267200,2,130,5.095238095238095
8398079,5,B003JE23OU,"I wanted to write a review from someone who is new to Yoga.  My friend Wanda recommended this DVD to me because she knew I was trying to live a healthier lifestyle and lose some weight.

My first impressions:  1)  I love the options on the DVD!  You are able to practice the movements with or without music.  I find the music very relaxing, but it's also great to be able to turn it off to concentrate more on the Yoga movements.  2)  I love that there are instructions on how to do the moves themselves!  I had a fear that I wouldn't be able to do these postures properly and was pleasantly surprised because there is a lovely narrator who explains how to get into and out of these movements.  3)  I never realized that breathing was so important in Yoga!  I originally thought that it was just stretching.  However, stretching and breathing combined was much harder than I thought.  I had a workout, but unlike cardio workouts where you sweat all over.  This workout stretched my muscles, my joints, and my flexibility.  I never realized how much tension I had in my body!  4)  Before, my impression of Yoga was that it was for women only.  Well, after trying this DVD for the first time, I have a new found appreciation for this exercise discipline and women who do Yoga.  The movements look deceptively easy.  However, actually keeping up with the instructor was much more difficult.  I could l only stretch and twist so far.  (Which wasn't very far at all!)  Watching the instructor move from one move to another with such ease made me realize that you have to be in such good physical shape in order to properly execute these movements.  You need to develop such flexibility, strength and discipline to hold some of these postures.  It's a real workout!  5)  I felt really ""centered"" after doing this Yoga DVD.  It sounds unusually, but I experienced a sense of ""clarity"" that you don't normally get from cardio workouts.  It's hard to describe, but it's like ""inner peace"".  I felt more mentally focused.  6)  I felt so relaxed!  All the tension and stress I normally carry in my body and mind just disappeared.  In fact, I never knew how much stress I carried with me until it was gone!  7)  I felt ""energized"" after doing Yoga for the first time!  Is this what it's like all the time?  This could be addicting!  I felt a tingling sensation throughout my body.  It's like every part of me felt super alive!  8)  I felt ""empowered"" after this first session!  I've never done Yoga before, but this format was easy to learn and apply.  It was fun!  The instruction was great and easy to follow.  The movements and breathing were not overly complicated.  However, there is a depth of knowledge in this DVD that I feel I'm only beginning to discover!  9)  This experience has been so positive, I can't wait until I do this again!  I am definitely going to incorporate Yoga in my training and my lifestyle!  This was a great introduction to Gentle Yoga for a Newbie like me!  - Allen  ;)",1283472000,2,2989,4.48785046728972
8398080,5,B003JE23OU,"I have been practicing various forms of Yoga for 3 years now.  I have enjoyed experiencing different styles and what they have to offer.  However, often times I have found the pacing of DVD's and classes a bit too quick to truly experience my body in the movements.  The wonderful thing about this DVD is that it is perfectly paced so that you can experience the flow and stay within yourself.  The beauty of this DVD is its accessibility and depth.  It subtly covers a topic that is not often addressed in Yoga, but is a serious problem for many; Clear digestive flow and how this effects all aspects of our health, energy, and clarity.  This integrative approach provides a simple solution for people of all levels, but especially beginners, to start feeling GREAT quickly and easily.

One of the most often overlooked aspects in Yoga is the restorative side.  This style of Yoga helps you relax, rejuvenate and feel new within yourself, while improving flow on all levels of the body (digestive, cardiovascular, breath, neural.)

I highly recommend this DVD for anyone looking to stimulate their body and rejuvenate themselves with a deep, relaxing, and accessible practice!",1280275200,5,1177,4.904040404040404
