7833245,5,6302993717,What an excellent way to teach old and young of where the songs originated from and who sung them.  It was wonderful seeing young and old actors in this video. I wish it came in a DVD.  I just love watching it and sharing it with others every Christmas.  5 stars for me.  Thanks also for the speedy delivery.,1420416000,,308,4.169491525423729

This is a really great movie if the tape was better.",1416268800,,143,4.333333333333333
