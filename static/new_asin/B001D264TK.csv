8291292,4,B001D264TK,"The Devil's Mercy is a well-made, well-acted, and well-written film with good acting by Stephen Rea as usual. The anamorphic picture is very good.",1355184000,,146,5.125
8291293,5,B001D264TK,as always the movie came in perfect condition however i didn't care for the film it must have been a tv movie no real action or scares,1336089600,,134,4.0
8291294,1,B001D264TK,"Well 1st of all, the description of the movie doesn't really even match the movie. It says 6yr old Calvin feels something isn't right and is anxious around his new upstairs neighbors while his mother dismisses it as her sons active imagination. Actually, the mother is the first one who feels this and is uncomfortable who's questioning everything from about scene one. But that's the least of all the problems with this movie.

I think I can safely give some insight into what the movie's about without giving away anything because the 1st few minutes of the movie gives away everything that's really going on with Tyler and his ""niece"" Kayla. There's something very off about them from the first few minutes and it lets you know that from the get go, as well as throughout the whole movie. There's no surprises with anything in this movie which is a big part of what ruins it.

  So, the Winters family is looking for a home to rent. They find a place and will be renting the top floor. Almost immediately, the father becomes very sick and pretty much stays that way through the entire film. So we're left with Mom and their son Calvin living upstairs, with the downstairs ppl living there.. Tyler and Kayla.

  Things just get weird with good ol' Uncle Tyler and his niece Kayla, but there's nothing puzzling about it because everytime they show the 2, they also show you exactly who they are, what their intentions are, what they want, why they're doing what they're doing, etc etc.. There's no surprises or twists to it because everything is given away from the beginning. I don't mean it's predicatable.. I mean they literally give everything away themselves so you don't even get a chance at guessing what could be happening.

  I won't tell you what all these things are just in case there's still someone out there who actually wants to see it for themselves.

 What you end up with is knowing everything while just watching the family that moved in trying to figure out what's going on. Yet we as the viewers already know. That's where the movie flopped. It never gives you the chance to wonder or be curious or even be interested. There's no twists and turns because you're just watching how long it will take the family to see what you've already seen; to see how long it takes them to know what you already know. There's no suspense, there's no guess work, there's nothing.

  And believe it or not, it gets worse. I guess they tried to give some ""surprise ending"" but the surprise ends up being you sitting there having no clue what just happened because it makes no sense. What it does is leave it open-ended as if there could be a sequel because there's absolutely no closure to anything you've watched to that point. The possibility of a sequel was and is the scariest part to this whole mess. Please don't waste your money.",1303257600,3,2841,4.586956521739131
8291295,3,B001D264TK,"A reviewer below mentions that the Devil's Mercy resembles the Skeleton Key during a few key elements, and I believe that to be completely accurate.  However whereas the Skeleton Key told a compelling story dealing with voodoo and evil and lots of interesting storytelling involving Kate Hudson's character going around town and eventually coming to an exciting action-packed finish, the Devil's Mercy is more like a secondrate mediocre imitation of the same thing.

As a result, the Devil's Mercy is quite predictable starting from 30 minutes in, all the way to the conclusion.  There's nothing even remotely unpredictable about the entire film, in fact.  The storyline is about soul stealing.  You can very easily put the pieces together and figure out what's going to happen by the ending.  The only real question is *how* is it going to happen.

I felt some of the storyline segments were really exaggerated too.  Was there really any need to have the father lingering around the house all day and night holding his stomach because of a ""virus?""  Absolutely not.  It was total overkill if you ask me.

The only really interesting character was his wife (or girlfriend- I forget if they were actually married or not).  At least she delivered with a strong acting performance and felt believable in her desire and determination in finding the answers to the ""strange"" events taking place.  The little boys only solid acting moment came at the very end, and the surprise ending is alright.

Notice I put the word ""strange"" in quotation marks?  It's because the storyline failed to actually deliver with the strange events.  No, a guy walking around with a stomach virus isn't THAT strange, and the entire soul stealing storyline isn't exactly strange either (well I mean, yeah it's definitely not something normal people would do, but you know you're watching a horror film so you know something far-fetched needs to be there in order to hold a plot together).

I think it would be best to skip this film and just watch the Skeleton Key instead.",1292544000,,2046,4.901162790697675
8291296,4,B001D264TK,"DEVIL'S MERCY recalled to mind SKELETON KEY. They both deal with witchcraft/hoodoo, capturing souls for longevity, secret identities,etc. Both films had very good scripts, direction & great actors. DEVIL'S MERCY featured the aclaimed Irish actor Stephen Rea. He is wonderful in the role of the sinister landlord, entrancing & enticing his new tenants into a siabolical plot. The supporting actors are excellent as well, particularly the girl who plays Mercy. The film has all hallmarks that qualify to as a real creepy work of art.

I'm glad people can rent from Amazon now. I had trouble with the prices of some of the things I was reviewing, yet didn't feel it was appropriate--or maybe even allowed--to suggest renting rather than purchasing. Now that barrier is done. One other factor that influences me is that I am at a stage of life were adding to a film collection is...well, kind of a waste of time. Still, taking these things into consideration, I can definately recommend THE DAVIL'S MERCY for renting or purchasing.",1285718400,,1027,5.005847953216374
8291297,4,B001D264TK,"I rented this movie unsure if I would like it or not, but as it turned out it was worth the $4 I paid. There's something quite sinister going on in this story but it's not clear just what that is for a while into the movie. I'm not saying it was slow in the beginning or that I lost interest. Quite the opposite. It kept me guessing. I like that in a movie. I looked at the prices this movie is going for and I'm shocked. Buy it. At these prices it's a steal.",1239926400,2,459,3.8421052631578947
