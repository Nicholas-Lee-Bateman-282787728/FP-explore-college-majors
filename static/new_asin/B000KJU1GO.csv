2692976,3,B000KJU1GO,"These documentaries contain an element of speculation, and employ a degree of imagination. Having said that if they are viewed with an open mind and appreciated for what they are intended to be, (not entirely based on fact, but making reasonable, educated assumptions as to what might have been) then these documentaries are very enjoyable in their own right. How seriously the viewer takes what is being said is an indication of how well informed or feeble minded he or she is. In other words how much you choose to believe is entirely up to you. If you are a well informed discerning viewer you will take what you see with a grain of salt and fill in the blanks for yourself. Nothing is set in stone. The viewer is merely presented with reasonable assumptions, possibilites and probabilites. The computer generated reconstructions are well done and make visualization a pleasurable experience. Well worth viewing.",1227139200,9,915,4.9480519480519485
2692977,2,B000KJU1GO,"First I would like to say that I am a big history channel fan. I own quite a few of their documentaries. This series is one of the worst I own.

The titles of the episodes seem exciting at first, but when one finds out the sheer non-fact based history behind most of the episodes, the result is disappointing. I mean honestly; how much can you really know about ""LOST WORLDS"" if there is little evidence to support their existence in the first place?

Most of the episodes run the same course. The introduction is given. The ""experts"" then find a tiny piece of circumstantial evidence. The rest of the episode is spent on a wild completely speculated tangeant of non-history based imagination. There is very little fact that goes into most of these documentaries.

If you are looking for a history channel documentary series that is truely historical, and is extremely factual I would go with ""Engineering an Empire"" with Peter Weller.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-History-Channel-Presents-Engineering-an-Empire-The-Complete-Series-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000S0GYNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The History Channel Presents Engineering an Empire - The Complete Series (Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;However my suggestion is to steer clear of this series. Save your money!",1214697600,9,1319,5.931578947368421
2692978,5,B000KJU1GO,"This DVD set was a fantastic buy. The episodes basically take a period of history and recreate it with modern day computer generated graphics and explain the significance of the structures, the events surrounding the structures, and the people involved. The episodes generally consist of the camera crew going to the area being covered and showing what it currently looks like. They throw in the comp generated version if what it used to look like. The archeologists/historians/narrator explain the historical significance of things throughout. There are also some dramatizations, but they are pretty minimal.
There is a wide variety of topics that are covered, so chances are you would find at least a few interesting episodes.
Some of the episodes include Rameses the II's Egypt, Knight's Templar, Jerusalem, Hitlers under ground bunkers, Greece, Pagan's in the British isles and more. My personal favorites were the 14th century Scotland, the early Christianity episode, and the episode on Vlad Dracula was fantastic.
For the price this DVD costs used you really can't go wrong, I highly recommend it.",1210550400,6,1104,5.278409090909091
2692979,1,B000KJU1GO,"I was disappointed by this ""documentary"" style series. It seemed like a fairly low-budget production as much of the film revolved around a few shots of the same place over and over again with not much in-depth exploration or archeological background. Also, the over-dramatization of very un-interesting little bits of footage was rather droll, especially in the first DVD. In my opinion, it's not worth the time to watch it.",1208908800,7,424,5.071428571428571
2692980,3,B000KJU1GO,My husband & I love documentaries.  We tend to like the BBC ones because they treat the viewer as intelligent adults and slide in dry humour every so often all the while without shouting. This documentary is a little more dumbed down & we needed to take brakes from the extra hype and constant repetition.  The computer stimulations are 5star and I wish they would have given them more screen time.,1204156800,19,398,4.591549295774648
2692981,5,B000KJU1GO,"I agree with the previous reviewer that LOST WORLDS gives you a great value for your money. I bought the series based on that review and was pleased I did. If you are a history buff, LOST WORLDS is a must for your DVD collection. I was particularly fascinated by the World War II era stories - HITLER'S SUPERCITY and SECRET CITIES OF THE A-BOMB. Historians take us on a journey of secret and forgotten cities of recent history. Computer images recreate what the cities looked liked. The series is fun, entertaining and visually stunning. A+++",1199318400,20,542,4.65625
2692982,5,B000KJU1GO,"Pretty cheap for 9 hours of running time. The animations are very cool, lots of good footage of old castles in the knights templer episode, very interesting historical story's like the real dracula, hitlers supercity , amazingly huge constructions displayed in many of the episodes in great detail, Three thumbs up.",1193270400,37,315,5.196078431372549

8157651,1,B000KJU1GO,What is the point of making a series that is obviously meant for the international market and giving all the measurements in feet and miles? The lack of understanding of these archaic terms of measurement spoilt the whole series for me as I couldn't conceive of the size of things. Don't buy it if you are metric!!,1369872000,,314,4.526315789473684

We are only beginning to discover what life and the true worlds that have been here and gone for so many years ago that man can't even put a number to it anymore.

8157654,3,B000KJU1GO,"I had very high expectations for this DVD Set. I am a sucker for documentaries about History and I thought this serie would be really really great. The idea behind this serie is very good but sadly the episodes are not very interesting. Sometimes it feels like this show had very little budget, sometimes I felt like I was watching PBS instead of The History Channel ( no disrespect to PBS haha ). Cities of the Underworld is a far better show. It's good, but I was expecting this set to be so much better, a lot more entertaining and interesting. Here is the lineup:

* Volume 1: Knights Templar, Jesus' Jerusalem, The First Christians, Palenque
* Volume 2: Atlantis, Ramses' Egyptian Empire, Athens - Ancient Supercity
* Volume 3: Secret Cities of the A-Bomb, Hitler's Supercity, Churchill's Bunkers
* Volume 4: The Real Dracula, Braveheart's Scotland, The Pagans",1309392000,2,865,4.805369127516778
8157655,5,B000KJU1GO,"If I could give this 4 1/2 instead of 5, I probably would, as I would take away 1/2 for lack of depth, but do not want to take a whole star for that. I thought production values were very good, and the experts hired for interview really knew their subject matter. It was, however, a bit brief on some subjects, particularly Stonehenge, Avebury, Silbury Hill. There was a little info here I had not seen before, however. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not have any objection to the CGI of what the structures would originally have looked like.",1291593600,,553,4.431372549019608
8157656,3,B000KJU1GO,"It's pretty good video to view, really just a few episodes I've seen. Thought the Paul & Early Church info was interesting, same as Jesus' Jerusalem. Very liberal in its presentation, but tries to determine the most accurate telling of history, using Darwinian assumptions while examining religion...",1261440000,4,300,5.404255319148936

8157658,4,B000KJU1GO,"It's a pretty good series....but some civilizations weren't mentioned at all.  Maybe, needs a part II.  (Where's Asia and Africa??????) ... should be titled, ""Lost White Worlds"".",1229126400,3,178,5.555555555555555
