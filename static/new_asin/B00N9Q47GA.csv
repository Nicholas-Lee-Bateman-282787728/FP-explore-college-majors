8676693,5,B00N9Q47GA,Scott's work gets to the root of addiction and how we can dissolve the fears and issues that lead us to escape. The methods are clear and simple and have proven to be effective for me with my eating disorder. I also love how he has so many resources for free through his websites and Facebook groups. He's transparent about his own addictions and recovery and 'gets it'. Love love love this book.,1423353600,,396,4.438356164383562
