420431,5,6301978196,"When you' ve seen "" Lawrence of Arabia"" and then wated this film you are confused about Peter O'Toole. He is so silly as Michael James, a man who loved sex. And his doctor Peter Sellers can't help with his problem very much. All actors are as much funny as possible!",995673600,,266,4.235294117647059
420432,5,6301978196,"They don't, and they can't make movies like this anymore!
""What's New Pussycat"" is soooooo evocative of the time - ...that legendary 60's period, & the time when Sellers could do no wrong in the cinema!
Back from his multiple visitation to the Heart Attack bed, he plays his character, (resplendant in wig, crushed velvet suit and severe pent-up sexual frustration) as only he could have done -  & there are certain lines and scenes where his comic genius is just such a pleasure to behold!
O'Toole is even still in his 'short' post Lawrence of A., pretty phase, but it's Sellers film - the only sad thing being, it's huge box office success led to P.S joining the cast of the Casino Royale abomination!!",989539200,,704,4.632

420483,2,6301978196,"This concerns the 2014 release on Kino-Lorber on Blu-Ray. Having collected DVDs and Blu-Rays for many years, this is one of the most disappointing transfers I've seen. It looks like something that might have been done in the 1990s. It might hold up on the small televisions of that era but not on modern big screen HDTVs. While the picture is very clean this does not make up for the lack of detail, murky blacks, poor skin tones, occasional uneven lighting across the screen, etc. The only thing worse than the picture is the distorted sound. You can still enjoy the movie but it really detracts. To add insult to injury, the on-screen menu is simply a static shot of the unattractive cover. I'd suspect this of being a bootleg, except that I ordered and received it directly from the manufacturer. Like most independent labels, Kino is dependent on the copyright holders for the quality of their releases. However, they're still in the position to reject a completely substandard transfer, which they should have done in this case. Kino offers some fine vintage releases, especially silent era films from responsible copyright holders such as Murnau-Stiftung, but this experience will make me considerably more wary of purchasing their products in the future.",1482796800,,1261,4.981042654028436

420534,2,6301978196,"Whatever you think of Woody Allen and his movies, his later ones were certainly better than this one. This was supposed to be the biggest hit of 1965 (the year I was born) and is now considered ""dated"" by many critics. Actually, I prefer to believe that even in 1965 it was not considered to be great either.

The story is about a playboy whom women find irresistibly attractive-namely flirts, nymphomaniacs, etc. and he in turn cannot resist their advances Which is bad because he wants to settle down and marry his fianc&eacute;e. So what does he do? Consult with a psychiatrist who is messed up in his own right.

The movie is meant to be a screwball farce, but it's crazy without being very funny. People run around, bump into each other, and a big chase scene in the end as was common in comedy movies of the day. But ultimately in substitutes silliness for real wit. It's like a mediocre Keystone Comedy that's not family entertainment. You'd get more laughs out of a standard Three Stooges movie.",1469232000,,1003,4.597765363128492

The movie itself warranted up to 5 stars, reduced to 4 for the print quality.
The plot was pure zaniness, the 60's personified.  Peter Sellers is a psychiatrist with a practice of patients worthy of Freud himself.  This menagerie of crazies is joined by Peter O'Toole, a man afflicted(sic) with the problem that he's too successful with women and they're driving him crazy.  What transpires is an hilarious series of strange scenes of maladjusted behavior.  Woody Allen(a young comedian in those days) appears as a dresser at the Folies Bergere.
Burt Bacharach provided the hit songs that you will remember.  If you've seen Austin Powers, you know Bacharach's hits and even him(he performed on the piano in Powers).  This was all just a part of the 'rockin' 60's'...
If the 'madcap' pace of the 60's and 'neurotic' humor is your bag, then this is a must-have.  If you didn't like the early Woody Allen or Mel Brooks films, then this isn't for you either...",1422230400,,1109,4.622448979591836

The content alone accounts for the three stars, as everyone should own 'What's New Pussycat'. The 'new' Blu Ray transfer however, is one of the poorest quality Blu Rays that I have seen.
The picture/image in my view is not as consistant and overall good as the MGM DVD release from 2005, of which I own two. The mediocre sound quality is at best on par with that release.
If you own the DVD hold on to it, and ignore this poor quality release. If however, you do not own the DVD and cannot find it at a low price, then own this version of an extraordinary,unique and zany timepiece, truly one of the best from that era.

420658,5,6301978196,"Most of the reviews of the quality of a DVD (and even a VHS tape!) are not relevant to this Blu-ray release of What's New Pussycat from Kino Lorber.

The quality of this Blu-ray is excellent. The colors are bright and gorgeous.

The film itself stars Peter O'Toole, Peter Sellers, Romy Schneider, Capucine, Paula Prentiss and Ursula Andress. The film also stars Woody Allen, in his first film. Woody also wrote the screenplay. The film is an anarchic 1960s comedy with many funny scenes, including one with Woody and Peter Sellers filmed on a bank of the Seine (the film is set in Paris).

The plot, such as it is, concerns Peter O'Toole's problem that he wants to marry Romy Schneider, but is distracted by Capucine, Paula Prentiss and Ursula Andress. As Woody Allen's character might say, this is a problem?

Finally, the trailer for the film (included on the Blu-ray) cautions that the film is for adults only. Which only goes to show how things have changed in the last 49 years. The sexual content in the film would not seem out of place today on the Disney channel. There is no violence, drug use or bad language.

Think my favorite remains Dr. Strangelove.  Obviously, Woody Allen has come a very long way since making What's New Pussycat and has made some remarkable movies over the past several decades.  But, if you'd care to see where he began, What's New Pussycat will explain a lot!

Back in the Sixties (which, oddly, had a history other than that involving Viet Nam, Civil Rights, and Feminism) folks were shaking themselves loose of the straightjacket that had been on them since, at least, the Great Depression, at most, the 13th Century. People wanted fun, color, and wackiness, and they enjoyed getting it. Why else would big no-nonsense film companies interested in profits sink dough into plotless wonders like this film and, say, Casino Royale?

This is kind of a fascist age. Folks of all political stripes are into no-compromise black and white ethics. Everyone's got an opinion. Everyone knows what's right for you. A movie like this is just great for those of us who find all this SERIOUSNESS tiresome, just as it was great for our kindred sisters and brothers back in the Sixties who were sick of their parents lecturing them (Nowadays it's our kids that sound like our dopey tight-[censored] parents--how did we let that happen?). There's no relevancy here, no addressing of pressing social issues--it's just mindless incorrect stupid fun. Buy it and hide it before the young'uns get around to burning it.

420684,5,6301978196,"One has to enter into the spirit of the thing: this is a B-movie and doesn't aspire to be anything else.  I love the ambiance, the actors, and many of the quirky lines.  One of the reviewers said that beautiful women were throwing themselves at Allen, Sellers, and O'Toole, but it's really only O'Toole (it may be the only film where Allen is rejected as much as he would be in real life were he not rich and famous).  I admit that as a feminist I have to suspend certain principles, but it's too fun not to love it regardless.  My favorite line is the stupidly charming ""You are a monster and a monster in that order"" by the long-haired psychoanalyst played by Sellers.  This is the only movie where Sellers doesn't annoy me to death and is more and more the only one in which I can watch Woody Allen without wanting to strangle him.  Not Romy Schneider's best work but always fascinating to look at.",1101600000,18,901,4.365269461077844
420685,4,6301978196,"Maybe sublime is too strong a word. This is one mess of a movie. It's like a nerdy kid trying desperately to be cool. Most of the jokes are unbelievably juvenile and even lame, and it's often obvious many of the cast members realized they were in a piece of crap and decided to at least enjoy themselves-- which actually helps.
That said, there are moments (and I mean moments) that make it worth watching. Paula Prentiss steals the show from everyone, there are some laugh-out-loud lines in the picture and some of Peter O'Toole's reactions are priceless. Another good scene is the one Peter Sellers and Woody Allen share. Finally, there may even be one emblematic shot in it too, during the getaway at the end of the picture.
What's new Pussycat is endearingly goofy and AWFUL, but I'm looking forward to it coming out on DVD.",1071100800,7,828,4.601351351351352
420686,5,6301978196,"I consider this to be the second best movie of the 60s.  The best is Casino Royal.  This is the first comedy movie written by Woodie Allen and it shows great hand crafting with many little details. There are several sub plots that interweave and come together in the last 15 minutes. One of the most amusing parts is the famous homosexual woman, Capucine, playing a heterosexual nymphomaniac.",1067644800,4,392,4.75
420687,2,6301978196,"I cant believe Woody Allen wrote this? This film is a mess.
After a very funny opening scene where peter Sellers orders Silence when your shouting at me!! it all goes down hill. The characters spend most of there time running from place to place with little or no reason. There are many attractive ladies to look at on the way, but none of the female characters seem to have any personality (and very few lines too) there just there to keep the cast numbers up.
Between Peter Sellers and Woody Allen there are a couple of classic one liners, but the problem is they all seem to get lost under the god awful Burt Bacharh score, which is irritatingly dated and over loud, so loud in fact that you cant hear the Dialog at times.
The humour is also a bit too random for my tastes at times; an attractive Parachutist falling out of the sky and strait into peter Otools moving car for no reason? or the chase sequence at the end of the movie were they all pass a Go kart track and decide to jump on for a spin?
Clive Donners direction is pretty flat in this picture too, full of crazy jarring edits and strange camera angles which distract you from the story instead of helping to tell it.
I am a big Woody Allen fan and I enjoy all his films (even the dramas), but I found this picture hard to sit through - give it a miss.",1052265600,6,1318,4.192913385826771
420688,4,6301978196,"Mike Myers must have been thinking of this film to inspire the Saturday Night Live sketch of my title and 'Austin Powers' - between the plot of an inveterate womanizer struggling to change his ways and Peter Sellers' character who may well be Austin's crazed Austrian uncle.
Every frame of this film looks like a full-page color Playboy cartoon - set in posh bachelor pads, grimy artist's garrets, smoky strip clubs, or the corridors of a no-tell-rendezvous hotel...
Not a brilliant piece of film; it sets up and discards an intriguing storyline where Peter O'Toole's friend Woody Allen is attracted to O'Toole's fiancee Romy Schneider, and, at a loss to how to end the film, everyone gets on go-karts and rides around. Much of the humor is (and I *hate* the term) politically incorrect by current standards, so beware.
For all that, I enjoy it immensely. O'Toole plays his role in a totally sympathetic Hugh Grant-sort of way, Sellers is a looney, Burt Bacharach's score is cheerfully deranged, and the women, dear God, they are gorgeous...I found myself attracted to Paula Prentiss's flaky exotic dancer/poet...I may need a few sessions with Dr. Fassbender myself.",1037750400,26,1166,5.015463917525773
420689,5,6301978196,"""What's New Pussycat"" was Woody Allen's first major film release.  Filmed in the city of love, Paris, the story centers around the very complicated love life of the character Michael James (Peter O'Toole), who is trying to stop seeing other women so that he can focus on the one woman he really loves, Carol (Romy Schneider).  To help him overcome his sexual addictions, he seeks professional help from the pschotherapist Dr. Fritz Fassbender (Peter Sellers). Unfortuneately for Michael, Dr. Fassbander is in greater need of psychotherapy since his sexual addictions are even more complicated.  In the opening scene of the movie, Dr. Fassbender and his wife Anna (Eddra Gale) are fighting about one of his love affairs that she has discovered.  She asks him, ""Is she prettier than me?""  He responds, ""Is she prettier than you? I am prettier than you!"".
Can Dr. Fassbender help Michael overcome his addiction to love affairs to gain Carol's trust?  You will probably enjoy discovering this answer by watching this very funny movie.",1004918400,46,1030,5.06508875739645
420690,2,6301978196,"I really hate to be the odd man out, as it seems everyone that has reviewed this movie enjoyed it, but, I think this movie is absolutely terrible! Maybe if I had seen this movie when it first opened I might have enjoyed it. This film, I'm guessing was probably some sort of ""wild sex farce"", but, some of the scenes seem average by today's standards. But, I just think this movie is awful. There's no getting around it. The directing by Clive Donner is awful. It seems as if he just told everyone, ""OK, go do what you like, meanwhile, I'll be here taking a nap. Wake if something exciting happens."" I've heard some backstage rumors about this movie, and most of them are true. The producers, including Charles K. Feldman, gave Donner nothing but trouble. Always over his shoulder telling HIM what to do! The film editing by Fergus McDonell (don't ask me who he is) is awful as well. He's sorta jump cutting from one scene to another for no other reason than, there's no joke around, so let's quite while we're ahead. He's just cutting scenes, in a way butchering the movie. Now, everyone on here says this movie is funny. Well is this movie funny? Yes, it is. True, it doesn't have the Woody Allen touch that would come in his later films, but, afterall this was his first time as a screenwriter. There are some great lines in this movie like an exchange between Michael James (Peter O' Toole) and his school teacher, after they share a kiss.
Teacher:Oh,Michael, this can't work! I'm 34 and you're 12!
Michael: Don't be negative!
Or an agrument between Dr. Fritz Fassbender (Peter Sellers) and his wife. She thinks he is cheating on her.
Wife: Is she prettier than me?
Fritz: Is she prettier than you! I AM prettier than you!
So, yes, this film does have it's share of laughs,but, the movie in whole is just a big,over-blown film. That has too many characters, and too many ideas to make it into a good comedy. I understand this was suppose to be a wild sex comedy, but this movie isn't silly in a funny way. It becomes silly in an annoying way. It even gets a bit boring around the middle, and some argue it goes on too long. There are nice performances by the ""late"" Capucine & Romy Scheider. Paula Prentiss is amusing as well. And, even though she's fun to look at, there is no need for Ursula Andress in this movie! Peter Sellers look absolutely ridiculous. He looks and sounds like kermit the frog! The ONLY real importance I feel this movie has is, it introduced the American public to Woody Allen (And yes that's a good thing lol). There have been so many stories about what went on while making this movie, it's a wonder it was even made at all! It's said that Feldman offered some words of wisdom to Allen. To sorta guide him. His intelligent words were: ""Write something where we can all go to Paris and meet some women!"" How is that not inspiring lol? The ending scene is something that the creative minds of Laurel&Hardy, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers, W.C. Fields, and the Ritz Brothers would of thought of! That should just give you a sample of what to expect when watching this movie. As I said besides giving us Woody Allen this film has very little to offer. The movie was up for one Oscar, ""Best Song"" ""What's New Pussycat"", which might be the only other good thing about this film.
p.s. If you really enjoyed this movie, maybe you'll like ""Casino Royale"". Which reteams many of the same people that were in this in that movie. Woody Allen, Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, producer Charles K. Feldman, and music by Burt Bacharach.",1003017600,8,3567,4.506172839506172
