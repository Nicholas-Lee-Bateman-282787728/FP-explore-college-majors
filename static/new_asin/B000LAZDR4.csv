8160673,1,B000LAZDR4,"As stated already the amount of dialog ""inofmercial"" vs. actual workout leaves much to be desired. Now let's talk about the workout - the routine is cheap and hard to follow. Don't get confused it's not a hard workout - just choreographed very badly. The instructor is a novice to put it mildly. Save your money on this one.",1242345600,6,324,4.508474576271187
8160674,1,B000LAZDR4,"This was the worst walking video ever.  There was so much advertising and talking that the actual workout wasn't worth bothering with.  I have never been so disappointed in a routine as I was with this one.  This was advertised as a challenging workout and it sure wasn't.

I would not recommend this video to anyone.",1173657600,22,317,4.607142857142857
