7985419,5,B00008LDNU,"Wonderful documentary about the 1930's, made relatively soon after (in the 1950s), which makes for a startling double perspective when viewed with today's events in mind. My mother was a young adult during these years, and this documentary really helped me understand what her world had been like.",1514764800,,297,5.208333333333333

7985422,5,B00008LDNU,"As a retired High School history teacher this is one of the films I always used when covering the Great Depression.  Alexander Scourby who could make a phone book sound interesting does marvelous narration from Herb Morrison's frantic description of the Hindenburg explosion to Joe Louis knocking out Max Schmelling and the ins and outs of the New Deal, Will Rogers and a great set of archive films of the New York World's Fair and vintage music of the era captured by Robert Russell Bennett it is a great, though brief hour of an amazing decade.",1399420800,,546,4.6875
7985423,5,B00008LDNU,"I was a child during this period of time and did not fully experience the impact of the depression.  I remember my father  coming home to tell my mother that we had no money.  His business had gone into the hands of the receiver and the bank with our savings had closed its doors.  My parents were living in a duplex which was quickly converted into a four plex.  It was poor timing on my part to have been born in 1932 and when my father went to pay the hospital for my arrival when told it would cost at least $100. he told them all he had was 50.00 and when they said that was not nearly enough his retort was to accept the money or ""keep the kid"".  They accepted the money.  Being that young I did not realize the struggle my parents went through.  My father borrowed enough money from his mother who did not believe in banks to get his business back and my mother taught piano lessons.  They earned enough money to purchase a house for $400. from the Federal Marshal who offered it if the purchaser would inhabit it and continue the payments.  They found out later it was available as a result of a bootlegging murder on he premises.  This was one of the last programs narrated by the master narrator Alexander Scourby.  It concluded with the New York World's fair and the visit to the US by the King and Queen of England.  The present Queen was not present as her parents thought she was to young.",1375315200,,1403,4.249056603773585
7985424,5,B00008LDNU,"What an incredible capsule dealing with America's thirties!!  I remember seeing this when in high school and was mesmerized
by it then. Alexander Scourby  was the greatest narrator of his time, which makes owning this work all the more worthwhile.
A short piece of Schmeling's knockout of Joe Louis in 1936 should have been included at to why the 1938 rematch was so
crucial to America. Still, a brilliant piece all around.",1361836800,,423,4.861111111111111
7985425,5,B00008LDNU,Great content! A nice documentary to preserve the historic record. I have found this very useful in my curriculum development.,1358380800,,126,5.35
7985426,5,B00008LDNU,"I'm a College-level economics instructor, so I LOVE using the first 2/3 of this video to demonstrate the political, economic, and social history of this era!

It is truly a fabulous educational tool that can be used over and over again for macro or entry-level survey students.  For example, it can be used to place the current economic downturn (the worst since '83) into greater context.",1238976000,6,389,4.878787878787879
7985427,5,B00008LDNU,This is an excellent production and shows the real facts about the depression of the 1930's. Like all the Project XX Specials it shows situations as they were.,1182211200,3,159,4.714285714285714
7985428,5,B00008LDNU,"This was originally a chapter in the excellent Project Twenty series on television 45 years ago. It is a magnificent look at a decade that included the depression, the Roosevelt years, the labor strife, and the gathering storm clouds in Europe. Beautifully narrated by the the most mellifluous voice of Alexander Scourby. The last five minutes while Scourby narrates the end of an era over images of the 1939 New York World's Fair and the music of the ""September Song"" is overwhelming (especially for anyone over 70). There isn't any television like this nowadays. A treasure.",1125187200,23,576,5.010416666666667
