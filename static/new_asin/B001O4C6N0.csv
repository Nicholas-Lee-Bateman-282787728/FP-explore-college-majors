3727098,5,B001O4C6N0,"What this box set offers that has not yet been made DVD available is ""The Red Green Story: We're All in This Together"" a 90 minute special.  The Red Green Show ran for 15 years and ended at the decision of originator, writer, and star, Steve Smith. He is Red Green. He made Red Green. This single DVD (only 1/4th of the box set) is worth the purchase. The 3 extra DVDs are outrageously funny gravy. If you own them already, gift the new copies. Your benefactor will love you AND Red Green.

The amazing hilarious reunion (with show segments), made after the final 300th episode of The Red Green Show, puts an intellectual slant on the actors and creators of the series. Fantastic.  Red Green (Steve Smith for real) is as thoughtful, intellectual, and wise as he was outrageous, comical, and stupidly naive portraying Red Green.  It is twice the fun to hear comments and then view a segment.  What brought on the bit's idea? What went wrong--besides the planned laughable misadventure of every situation? What was learned?

The Red Green character, at some point within the set, is similar to other comedy stars.  He resembled Red Skelton by his commonness and innocent thinking.  He resembled Tim Conway with off-beat funny gags, almost becoming believable.  He seemed like Lucille Ball, Queen of American Comedy, in his constant expression of normality regardless of the preposterousness of the event.  He passes for Groucho Marx through one-liners delivered without even a smile.  Of course Green is the Canadian version of America's Tim-The-Tool-Man-Allen. He is as straight faced and serious through the gags as Bob Newhart.  One can even relate Red Green to the comic character, Bullwinkle the Moose.

Show regular and side kick, Harold, the nephew (played by Patrick McKenna) is available to discuss the programs longevity. New praise is felt for Harold (not because we have the same name) because after seeing and hearing the actor, the magnificence of the portrayal of the character is known. McKenna was an award-receiving star in both drama and comedy. In this DVD, the segment he introduces his girlfriend, Bonnie (Laurie Elliott) is included as well as the wedding ceremony in the final #300 episode. Funny, funny, funny.

It includes poetry from the original taping of Red Green in the snowy woods called ""The Winter of our Discount Tent.""  Memories from the poor handwritten letter responses include, ""Kelp up the gord walk.""  The segment when Red Green had a melt down after Possum Lodge ran out of duck tape.  And lest we never forget: ""Quando omni flunkus moritati.""

This DVD also includes the first (show #86) and the last (show #300) time Red talks to middle-age men. ""I'm pulling for you. We're all in this together.""

If you want more information about the remaining three DVDs included, look them up individually through my reviews. There you can find out more details of the futility of reasonable behavior, comical calamity, funny dysfunction, the farcical, ludicrous logic, riotous rebuilding, curious comradery, comic construction, dubious duct tape attempts, and absurd brain behavior. High jinks and merrymaking at it's finest.

CAUTION: do not try eating while sitting on the couch viewing this DVD set. Excessive and sudden laughter can cause projectile non-chewed food bits.  Also choking should be expected.

Hours of recommended uproarious entertainment. For you or for someone you want to give the gift of laughter. Laugh-out-loud at Red Green.

3727100,5,B001O4C6N0,"First let me state, I have a advance review copy.

This set contains Four specials from The Red Green Show, three of which were previously released individually years ago.  But one new one stands out.

THE RED GREEN STORY: WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER (2008). Approx. 90 min. 16:9 Widescreen with windowboxed clips. [closed captioned]
{Documentary}
Two years after the final episode, cast members reminisce about the show's remarkable run in this Canadian TV special that ran on PBS in the states. Rare clips, audition anecdotes, and production memories tell the behind-the-scenes story of the little show that could-even when it probably shouldn't have.  It is great that old VHS clips exist of Richard McKenna performing on an amateur stage in Second City.  You want to see more as he is doing Harold!  There are also early clips of Steve Smith doing his Red Green persona before starting the show.  Other clips are segments pulled from the shows.  I do wish there were actual behind-the-scenes footage from the show, or even bloopers.  Mistakes must have been recorded, but maybe with the low budget the tape was re-wound & re-recorded over until they got it right.  The meat of this special is the cast themselves. All appear out of character as they looked in 2008, talking about how they got on the show & how their characters developed.  One story I did not know was just why Richard left the show, I thought it was because he started doing another show.  I also learned why the show got a name change to The NEW Red Green Show.  Here in the states it all ran as one show. ***Oh, I'm not going to tell why, you are going to have to buy this DVD to find out (If you have not already seen this special on PBS).

HINDSIGHT IS 20/20 (2003). Approx. 60 min.+ 66 min. of bonus footage. 4:3 full frame [closed captioned].
{Mocumentary produced for PBS}
Where the above special is an actual documentary, this one is a mocumentary.  The characters are treated as if they actually exist.  Harold gets the idea for Uncle Red to do a show when he sees his uncle appear on the Smith & Smith show (actual show).  The same clip seen in the new documentary above is seen here.  Fortunately only about a half-dozen clips are duplicated in both shows.  What is nice is that this show focuses on many early season characters not mentioned in the new documentary, so they both complete the picture better.  All interviews with the supporting characters are done as if the actors are the characters, they talk about doing the show at the lodge with Red & Harold.
The special features section provides complete versions of the clips seen in the mocumentary, you will get to see more of the early Smith & Smith Show segments featuring Red Green of ""Red Green's Hunting & Fishing Lodge"".

RED GREEN PHD/DVD* : *DUCT TAPE VIRTUOSO DELUXE (2000). Approx. 64 min.+ extras. 4:3 full frame.
The name of this video special was due to it being Red Green's premier on the DVD format. Red talks about bending his rules of embracing new technology and use this DVD format to talk about how to use the Handyman's Secret Weapon: Duct Tape!  Obviously the Handyman corner segments of the show using Duct Tape are included here.  Extras include fan-made duct tape creations and a Red-guided tour of a duct tape factory.

WE CAN'T HELP IT; WE'RE MEN (1997) 65 min./ OF CARS & MEN (1998) 71 min. 4:3 full frame.
First Red & the Possum Lodge gang tackle the subject of the male condition and achieve ""a better understanding between the various sexes."" using clips from the show. Then Red gives useless advice about every man's first love-his car and how to use it better by adapting it for new tasks.  The contraptions created would make any car lover cringe!  Again, more clips from the show. (originally released on two VHS tapes)

The older three specials are fun (although I prefer watching the complete shows), it is the new forth special where the cast talks about producing the series that grabs my interest.  While I would prefer to avoid duplicating the other specials, if this is the only way to get this new special I suggest buying this box set.
Yes, it would be ideal if Acorn Media would release THE RED GREEN STORY WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER as a individual DVD (write to them requesting this).  But consider that if you buy this set you will have extra copies of the other specials to share with others and create new Red Green Fans.",1235520000,9,4984,5.10727496917386
8329473,3,B001O4C6N0,"15 years of the show & by these 4, 1 hour-long specials, you'd think they only made about 10 episodes.  Don't get me wrong...the show is as hilarious as ever.  I was just disappointed to find that throughout all 4 specials, they kept re-showing the same darn clips. They were funny the first time, but like I said...you'd think they never did anything funnier than the relatively few clips they run into the ground on these specials.

Unrelated to the review of this box-set...I bought another box set of 48 Red Green full episodes & wouldn't ya know it....it included all the same episodes that contained the over-referenced clips in those stupid specials.  Do they just hate everything else they did or something?",1456963200,,715,4.788617886178862

8329481,2,B001O4C6N0,"Let me start by stating that I find some of the RGS skits among the funniest subjects I have ever seen.  He and his crew has brought me to laughing so hard that it became painful, and at my age I cannot remember the last time that I was able to make such a statement!

That being said, I am very disappointed in  this set overall.
I thought that much of the material was not particularly funny, and often boring.
To each his/her own taste.

I found the reunion very interesting and insightful.
Laking however were many important characters from his show.
I was also particularly interested in the individual who played Harold telling how he: ""Always followed Steve Smiths exact instructions"" and that ""even if he tried to improvise, it would be inferior to Steve Smith's original idea"" and how ""Steve Smith always knew best what to do"" ... .
This gave me insight into a possible weakness of the show and product offerings.
A very big ego and a product who are IMHO crying for a good manager / editor.
A great strength, with a great weakness?!

This is my opinion.  To each his / her own!

But again, I am a big fan of the show.  And when it is good, oh, it is so very good.
For me, a shame that Mr. Smith cannot find a partner who will edit such products better.  But that is my opinion.

It is possible that I would have been happier with purchasing original series of the show, but at this point, without understanding this product line and without insight into what is offered, I am afraid to purchase more.  A shame.",1295222400,,1520,4.3546099290780145
