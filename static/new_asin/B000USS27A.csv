It is one of the goriest, meanest, down right nasty films I have ever seen. It instantly went on my favorite B-movies of all time list. Highly recommended. The female lead is super hot and kicks mucho a**. Get it!",1196208000,6,324,4.327868852459017

8214657,1,B000USS27A,"Three girls from St. Xavier skip class and end up meeting a Latino David Hess. Then one of them spits on everyone's grave.

This is apparently a Catholic school which allows micro-mini skirts and bare midriffs. The film used Troma style effects which included sick over-the-top scenes that I haven't seen since 'MILFS vs Zombies."" I am not sure where the bolt cutters and tools suddenly came from. The production used 70's style gore film music. The acting was bad and dialogue had a juvenile appeal. The garbage bag over powering scene was unrealistic, the guy did have a gun, was 6 inches taller,  and ...oh never mind.  I don't know of any ""hood"" that has so much open park with no one there. Good idea. Terrible execution.

8214659,2,B000USS27A,Everybody kept saying how gross and not for the faint of heart. The truth is I rate this movie PG13 It has to be one of the funniest movies of all times.,1404000000,,153,3.8125
8214660,2,B000USS27A,i expected a longer storyline and more gore possibly a few short lived victims posed after results leading to the main characters based on the title..and frankly not enough nudity for such pretty girls and the broken bottle was just stupid and wrong..stick with staddings and such acts of film torture however scripted,1403222400,,318,5.018867924528302
8214661,5,B000USS27A,This movie is excellent movie enjoy but you need a strong stomic to watch so be a wear of the movie it is very sexuality not for kids at all do not bring kids only adults you need a good head to focus enjoy no girl friend recommended  enjoy if girls watch it remember its only a movie not real life .,1367712000,,300,3.838709677419355
8214662,1,B000USS27A,"This movie has all the makings of a usual sexploitation flick, however this goes overboard with excessive sexual violence and degradation. It starts out with 3 completely naive schoolgirls and a boyfriend, of course one of them is a virgin, on their way to a party, take a wrong turn and run into three cliched mexicans. They are tortured, raped, degraded in the most brutal of fashion. The bottle scene is one of the most sickest, revolting scenes in this movies. The 2nd half is all about bloody revenge, the killings are original but way over the top especially the abortion scene.

Avoid this movie at all costs.",1238889600,,616,4.703703703703703
8214663,5,B000USS27A,"With a stellar cast (rivals that of Goodfellas) and amazing special effects (rivals that of Transformers) I am shocked that this did not win an Oscar.

With the bullet chasing the person I felt as though I was riding on top of the bullet on a magical adventure into the unknown.  Just wait til you see the coat hanger scene! The special effects and realism rival that of such hit shows as ER and CSI!

The caliber of acting of this movie had me so involved that I actually thought I was part of a Mexican gang.  I was going around here for days walking with a gangsta limp and calling people esse and chulo!

My only gripe with this movie is that it was not long enough.

I heard they are coming out with a sequal that is supposed to be longer and answers all of the unanswered questions.  I heard that Jerry Bruckheimer himself might produce this!

I can't wait!",1224979200,2,863,4.283950617283951
8214664,4,B000USS27A,"Usually you have to look overseas to find exploitation cinema like this.  I am a big fan of Italian and Japanese horror, some of my rules for watching films are they cannot have anyone in them you have ever heard of before and the gorier they are the BETTER they are.  When films like The Hood has Eyez pulls off scenes like the abortion scene they way they did it just catapults the movie higher up my list.  I for one want to see more movies like this and my next purchase from Amazon is probably going to be Defenceless, i had been looking at both of these films for about a month prior to buying Hood and i am definatly NOT dissapointed with it.",1223164800,,649,4.176
8214665,3,B000USS27A,"""Crew!? We don't need no stinkin' crew?""

From the very first seconds of footage, the type of film you are about to see is completely revealed to you. That is because Kimmy, the main character, is also completely revealed to you in full frontal ( and full rear for that matter )nudity while in the shower. When she is dressed, her outfit is ridiculously revealing, almost as if she is in a Max Hardcore film, so too are the identical outfits of her school chums...They are meant to be highschool students but look to be around 25, which figures. With bad lighting, minimal locations, muddled audio, and long hand held takes, any actual film buff can tell that outside of the camera man and actors themselves, it is very likely that no other actual crew members even exist. Another threadbare factor to The Hood Has Eyes, is that the plot is simply another in a long line of girl gets abducted, raped, abused, and then goes on a killing spree against those who did her wrong films. We are thus going to watch, in vivid detail, the atrocities inflicted on her and her friends, and then her own atrocities inflicted on the wrong doers, supposedly with no legal ramifications. Simply put, this is not a film for anyone who needs sophistication with their media. The acting and dialog are completly ameturish, the film quality a step above minimal. It is a film in which everything done to another person both good and bad is of the lower GI variety. In a word, The Hood Has Eyes is what it is, sophomoric in every way shape or form.

"" Kung Fu training!? She don't need no stinkin' Kung Fu training!""

I would love to meet the person who actually takes this film seriously enough to be moved and caught up in the drama. An especially silly sequence is when Kimmy starts to train for her revenge. First she breaks a long stick in half, then she is seen twirling the two halves over her head like the worlds most uncoordinated marching band member. Next, she is seen doing about ten push-ups, fallowed by a rather head scratching moment in which her new found ninja skills are portrayed by her shuffling like a chimp behind tree trunks and shrubbery. This is of course suppose to represent her amazing instantaneous trasnformation into a killing machine. Because we all know that mastery in Kung Fu doesn't take years of training by a person who doesn't lose interest in it. And a teacher? who needs a stinkin' teacher? As long as your mad enough at someone, you can just invent your own style of Kung Fu out of thin air right? And in a single day!..Yes with Dogged determination to right an injustice done to you, you to can become grasshopper with just ten easy push-ups...
"" I know, I know I shouldn't be so literal, I guess I just have to let the art roll right over me.""
But lets be honest here for a minute. This is, in reality, a film made by a small group of friends who figured out an idea that they could do with next to no budget and still find a market for it. To spice it up they added in a few goodies that you will not find in any other film such as a ""Dirty Sanchez"" and a rather thrill inducing abortion sequence, yet ultimately, The Hood Has Eyes is a laugh riot. It is an oddity that belongs in the same pile as your Russ Meyer's collection. It is a film that belongs in the same stack in which you keep Joanna Angel's infamous parody The XXXorcist. It is something you watch as a double bill with Malabimba, FrankenHooker, or John Water's trash cinema splendors like Desperate Living, Female Trouble, or Pink Flamingoes. The Hood Has Eyes is a kind of missing link of a film that could bridge the gap between pure trash cinema, and something else. I just haven't figured out what that something else could be.",1202860800,15,3723,4.440058479532164
