1362078,2,B00004W5UX,"""Captain Kidd"" was made in the mid 40s when pirate films were at their peak. We had the great ""Treasure Island"" (1934), Errol Flynn's film debut in Captain Blood"" (1935), ""The Buccaneer"" (1938), Errol Flynn's ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940), Tyrone Power's ""The Black Swan"" (1942), and ""Reap the Wild Wind"" with John Wayne and Paulette Goddard.

The film stars the great Charles Laughton with Randolph Scott, Barbara Britton, and John Carradine.

Laughton was one of the true giants of the big screen. He won the Oscar for ""Henry VIII"" (1933) and was nominated twice more for ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935) and ""Witness for the Prosecution"" (1957). These 3 performances alone are among the top 25 performances ever captured on the big screen, but in addition he gave us such compelling characters as police inspector Javert in ""Le Miserables"" (1935), Quasimodo in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939), Herod in ""Salome"" (1953), and Senator Cooley in ""Advise and Consent"" (1962). In ""Kidd"" he does a less than wonderful job. Indeed he does a much better job when he reprised the role in ""Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd"" (1952).

Randolph Scott  started in silent films and his early career involved playing a variety of characters in a variety of films - ""My Favorite Wife"" (1940), ""To the Shores of Tripoli"" (1941), ""Home Sweet Homicide"" (1946) - but by the 50s he was appearing exclusively in B westerns - ""Sugarfoot"" (1951), ""Carson City"" (1952), ""The Bounty Hunter"" (1954), ""7th Calvary"" (1956), ""Westbound"" (1958) - most of which were directed by Budd Boetticher (7 films) or Andre de Toth (6 films). His final film, ""Ride the High Country"" was made in 1952 and was the first film directed by Sam Peckinpah. Scott had amassed a fortune from California real estate investments, and he retired from film making because he considered his performance in ""High Country"" to be a good note to go out on. Scott was a good actor and his heroic side is clearly in view in ""Captain Kidd"", even if he is a little boring in this film.

Barbara Britton plays Scott's love interest. This was her first film with Scott and they would make two more - ""Gunfighters"" (1947) and ""Albuquerque"" (1948). She made a few dozen films, and eventually made the transition to TV where she is best remembered for the ""Mr. & Mrs. North"" series (1952-1954) opposite Richard Denning. Britton is attractive and reads the lines well enough, but clearly not Olivia deHaviland.

John Carradine was a terrific character actor. He was a part of John Ford's Stock Company and gave memorable performances in ""Prisoner of Shark Island"", ""Stagecoach"" (1939) and ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940). He's best known to us today for his continuing role as Serenity Johnson in son David's TV series ""Kung Fu"" (1972-1975).

Also featured are Sheldon Leonard, John Qualen, Gilbert Roland and Reginald Owen.

- Sheldon Leonard was the quintessential gangster. His crooked face and New York accent were perfect for the criminals he played in films like ""Guys and Dolls"" (1955) and ""Jinx Money"" (1948). Leonard made a successful transition to TV as an actor and later as a major producer and director (""Andy Griffith Show"", ""Danny Thomas Show"", ""Dick Van Dyke Show, ""I Spy"", etc.). He's a bit of an embaressment in this film as a pirate.

- John Qualen is best known as one of the John Ford Stock Company players, appearing in such memorable roles as the crazed but determined Muley in ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940), Jose in ""Tortilla Flats"" (1942) and Lars Jorgensen in ""The Searchers"" (1956). But Qualen didn't only work for Ford, and racked up an incredible 200+ roles in his career from 1931 to 1974. He is completely wasted in ""Captain Kidd.""

- Gilbert Roland was nominated for a Golden Globe in 1953 for playing a Mexican (""The Bad and the Beautiful"") and in 1965 for playing an Indian (""Cheyenne Autumn""). During his long career (1925 - 1982) he would play a Greek, a French-Canadian, an Italian, and most memorably, ""The Cisco Kid"" in a variety of films from 1946 to 1947. He does a decent job as a pirate in this film, but this is uncharacteristically a very small role for Roland.

- Reginald Owen is terrific as the tutor to Laughton. Owen was a distinguished actor who appeared in over 100 films including playing Scrooge in ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938), Admiral Boom in  ""Mary Poppins"" (1964) and General Teagler in ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" (1972). He had the distinction of playing both Sherlock Holmes (""A study in Scarlet"") and Dr. Watson (""Sherlock Holmes"") and played King Louis XV in 3 different films.

The film is directed by Rowland Lee who specialized in costume dramas like George Arliss' ""Cardinal Richelieu"" (1935) ""The Three Musketeers"" (1935), and ""The Son of Monte Cristo"" (1940). ""Captain Kidd"" was his last film. It's unclear what went wrong, but the film has been pieced together in such a manner that the narrative is difficult to understand. Moreover, the scenes are static, as is the camera, making the film difficult to watch as a swashbuckling pirate movie.

The film's budget is over $1 million, but you won't see that price reflected in the production values. The models are obvious and there are very few scenes of naval battles.

If you're looking for pirate films, look elsewhere. If you want to see Laughton, there are much better films than this. Indeed, none of these fine actors turns in a bravura performance.",1270944000,6,5398,4.845819761129207
1362079,4,B00004W5UX,"Charles Laughton was unparalleled as a character actor and ""Capt. Kidd"" is just one of his masterpieces.  Even after more than 50 years this performance and this film hold up well and entertain.  Too bad more of his films are not readily available.",1269561600,2,248,4.744186046511628
1362080,3,B00004W5UX,"Captain Kidd (1945) The always interesting Charles Laughton takes on the title role, one he played at least one other time (in Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd). This time though it's a little more serious as the wily pirate captain lies, cheats, steals, and murders his way through a big portion of the supporting cast, all in the pursuit of being recognized as a nobleman by English king Henry Daniell. Luckily, wronged nobleman's son Randolph Scott has managed to join Kidd's crew and plans to put a stop to the pirate's nefarious doings. Laughton is terrific here, playing Kidd as a lower class Britisher whose yearnings to go up in station lead him to all sorts of wicked deeds. He is ably supported by a fine cast, including the always welcome Daniell, my fave John Carradine, and Barbara Britton, absolutely luscious as the damsel in distress. Scott may be the only wrong note in the cast as he is a little too old for his part and a little miscast, but he provides star power and I'm glad he got to get away from the Westerns for a while. Director Rowland V. Lee (Son of Frankenstein) was obviously working with a relatively low budget, and while there is no big sweeping action in this movie, with hundreds of pirates swarming over enemy ships, there are a couple of good swordfights, and the ships are realized through some charming miniature work. If you like a good old fashioned movie with smatterings of drama, action, suspense and romance, I recommend this one, me hearties!",1229212800,,1494,4.684410646387833

The chick is just window dressing as was typical of such films of that time.

The solid company of CAPTAIN KIDD includes New Yawker Sidney Sheldon. He played the racetrack tout on Jack Benny's radio and television shows and produced many famous TV series in the 1960s.

Charles Laughton, who was Lt. William Bligh in MGM's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MUTINY-ON-THE-BOUNTY/dp/B00011D1OK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY</a>&nbsp;(1935) is cast as a fictionalized version of privateer William Kidd. Laughton portrays this Scotsman as a Cockney-accented social climbing scenery chewer who hires valet Reginald Owen hoping to be civilized by this genteel fellow.

This story is awash with pirate clichs and clich pirates, yet an ample sprinkling of action and Laughton's eyebrow-waggling presence overcome such deficits as a lack of continuity and a woefully miscast Randy Scott.

Swashbuckler fans won't be disappointed here. Sticklers for historical accuracy on the other hand...

1362147,5,B00004W5UX,"Captain Kidd (1945) starring Charles Laughton is a wonderful movie.

It is stagy, and hurray for that.

Stage plays with main actors like Laughton are nowhere to be seen anymore, and ""stagy movies"" like this one keep us reminded about the wonderful art of staged drama and great stage actors.

Laughton's actor work is breathtaking...he's the star, and other actors are supporting actors.

Barbara Britton, the lead actress, is physically beautiful and that's all.

Good.

It's a man's movie, a swashbuckler, and she's decoration. Not more.

That used to be a frequent tradition in swashbuckler movies, but since women have been ""liberated"" and are always, and must always be...""important"".....just beautiful and otherwise agreeable and quiet is not longer seen. Hurray for Barbara Britton and her leading lady character....one can understand why the leading romantic male...Randolph Scott.....was interested in her, and ended up with her.

This movie is available (2009) at WalMart in bins which offer cheap, older movies. I got it for $4.00 along with twenty other movies (several very good) in a ""family pack"" movie which had poor labeling....

I took pot luck, and lucked out!

Many good movies of the past ended up ""slipping through the cracks"" and were never available in video stores, or ranked as ""great movies,"" including some truly great movies! Captain Kidd (1945) starring Charles Laughton is a truly great movie. See it.

How many others are ""out there"" unhonored and cheap to buy, sold by the likes of WalMart (the chain store we all ""love to hate"" but buy from frequently....and with good reason, it turns out)?

But its glory is in the wonderful character actors that we no longer have. These include the protean Reginald Owen, the evergreen John Carradine, and the also very under appreciated, sardonic Henry Daniell, a literate man, who plays the cold but laser intelligent King William III.

The story begins at Madagascar where pirates prey on merchant ships that transport wealth from India. Captain Kidd's men dig a pit for a treasure chest. Three is a question over the division of the loot. [Burying the loot hides the evidence or piracy.] Kidd learns about being a gentleman. At Hampton Court the King considers William Kidd for a mission. They make a deal so Kidd will protect a treasure ship. Kidd asks for condemned pirates for his crew. Kidd visits the jail to offer a deal to the condemned: serve him and be reprieved. The men make their mark. Kidd meets an old acquaintance. Kidd has ambitions, and that takes money. Kidd talks to his officers at dinner. They wonder about Mercy's actions. The Master Gunner trains his crew. Kidd plans to meet a merchant ship loaded with wealth. There is an accident aboard ship that kills a man. [One less to share the loot?] Mercy snoops in Kidd's cabin; what is his price?

They meet another ship at sea. Kidd borrows powder and shot. One of his men lights a candle in the powder hold. There is an accident on Kidd's ship. ""What manner of ship is this?"" There is conflict between Kidd and Lorenzo. Mercy talks to the young lady. Kidd talks about his plans. There is a scream and a sword fight! Man overboard! Kidd finds a medallion and draws a conclusion. The ship stops to replenish its water supply. Kidd goes to retrieve that buried chest. There is a conflict. [Body double?] ""Anything may happen."" Kidd explains the loss of Mercy. Then there is a surprise! They plot to save Lady Anne. But their boat is seen! Kidd orders the long boat in pursuit. No survivors. Back in London King William receives Captain Kidd and asks about Lady Anne and the treasure. Kidd has an explanation for everything, until Mercy and Lady Anne appear as witnesses. Kidd challenges anyone to find his treasure. The account is closed. Blayne gets his reward, a ship and a wife.

I think this is at best an average movie. A better story would have helped, it seems too restrained for an action movie. How many of its viewers know anything about late 17th century history and the history of this era?",1340841600,,2159,4.573643410852713

Kidd is captain of a British ship, but unknown to the king, a pirate. His crew are, like him, a bunch of cutthroats, ready to sell anyone out for a bit of treasure - Kidd is just better at it than the rest. Scott is the hero and as good in this roll as I've ever seen him.

This film features several well known actors: Randolph Scott, John Carradine, Gilbert Roland, Henry Daniell, Reginald Owen, and the incomparable Charles Laughton as Captain Kidd.  Kidd is a scoundrel of high order who keeps a hit list.  He takes great joy in crossing off the names of those who have crossed him, one way or the other........real or imagined slights.  Naturally, Laughton has the best dialog and he knows just how to use it.  The plot enjoys more intrigue than action, although there is a dandy, albeit brief, sword fight.  A few ships are sunk.  Its a fairly decent pirate adventure.  I bought it for my Charles Laughton collection.  The transfer is a bit rough in spots but as this film was released in 1945, allowances must be made.
