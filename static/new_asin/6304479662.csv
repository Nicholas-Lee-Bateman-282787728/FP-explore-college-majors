894301,2,6304479662,"It's been written that Elvis practically had to be dragged to the movie set for this one. Probably to the recording studio as well. Let's presume that by 1967 Presley he was totally fed up with escapist, ""formula"" movies and soundtracks - and also more than aware that there was less and less box office for this kind of enterprise. It appears that he was persuaded to another one because he wanted to buy a ranch and he actually needed the bucks. So the overweight, overage Elvis showed up to grind it out.
In previous disappointing celluloid efforts he usually managed to pull off many scenes and songs with style and energy. Here his acting is dull and detached and despite the inclusion of three excellent ballads (""The Girl I Never Loved"", ""A House That Has Everything"" and Ray Charles' ""You Don't Know Me"") his *singing* is also not up to par. [Indeed, he decided to recut the Charles number later that year].
I recommend viewing this picture in a double-feature mode: run the ""'68 Comeback Special"" as the second feature and appreciate the contrast.",1006732800,4,1056,4.713513513513513
894302,1,6304479662,Thios is probably the worst DVD that was ever released by a major company. Not since that infamous withdrawn 'CHARRO'-DVD was one of the King's movies mistreated like this. It seems like this DVD was mastered from a dub of a 16mm-copy instead of a master. Shame on MGM. Hope they get it right the next time.,1002499200,6,307,4.4035087719298245
894303,5,6304479662,"This was the 3rd and final film that Elvis Presley stared with Shelley Fabares. Remember in the first two films, Elvis had a combo and sang at clubs. But this time he is on his own.
Scott Heyward (Elvis Presley) is a millionaire's son. But he doesn't need $$$$ like his old man.
In the Sunshine State, he trades places with Ton Wilson (Will Hutchins, Spinout). Tom is going to be a ski teacher for a hotel. Elvis's first student is Dianne Carter (Shelly Fabares).
There is aslo a playboy boatracer named James Jamison (the late Bill Bixby) down there too. Scott's father (James Gregory) owns Heywood Oil. Scott aslo meets a boat co owner named Sam Burton (Gary Merrill).
There is a big boat race coming up. And Scott, Tom & Sam used a boat 50-50.

894403,4,6304479662,"Clambake is another light hearted Elvis vehicle. But Shelley makes it fun. But in a way they also make fun of it themselves.  Just watch the fight between Elvis and Bill Bixby.

This is the first time this movie appears in true widescreen.  All previous issues were 1.33;1 with widescreen within.  If you expanded it, it would be very grainy.  This one is pretty good, but I guess they could not get a clean master copy.

The extras on here, besides the trailer, is an audio commentary by three people from Videodrome, now Atlanta's GA only video rental store.  Don't bother listening to them.  They are full of misinformation and mostly make fun of the movie.

894467,3,6304479662,"Even from its weak title, you can tell this is not intended to be a great movie. Elvis plays a millionaire's son who is tired of women who want his wealth rather than him as a person, and he runs away from home, meeting a poor water-ski instructor at a gas station who wishes he did have money. So they agree to trade vehicles and identities and proceed to a hotel in Miami, Florida, and both meet a bunch of girls. Elvis also happens to meet a boat engineer who has a damaged racing boat and who had originally hoped to win an upcoming boat race. Can Elvis save this man's dreams? Performances are okay, but dancing and musical numbers are nothing special. It's okay, but Elvis has done better than this.",1474156800,,705,4.348484848484849

894469,5,6304479662,"I didn't want it to get passed me that today marks the THIRTY-NINETH ANNIVERSARY of the untimely death of ELVIS PRESLEY. I bought this movie some years back, probably as many as twelve years ago. I hadn't seen ""CLAMBAKE"" before the 1980's. It is a twist on ""THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER"" story, modern day style. ""Scott Hayward"", ELVIS, plays a Wealthy Engineer, who makes makes an attempt at living an Everyday Toned Down Life by switching places with poor Ski Instuctor, ""Tom Wilson"", played by WILL HUTCHINS. Scott switches his car with Tom's Motorcycle, along with swapping their identities. ""Dianne Carter"", played by SHELLEY FABARES, from the show: ""COACH"", is in Florida looking for a Wealthy Man. She doesn't know about the swap between Scott and Tom. Instead she makes a play for Wealthy Businessman, ""James J. Jamison"", played by BILL BIXBY, from the show: ""THE INCREDIBLE HULK"".

""Dianne"" hires ""Scott/Tom"" to give her some Skiing Lessons, so that she could get closer to James, since he is in Florida for the BOAT RACES. After the lessons she accepts a date from ""Scott/Tom"", but tells him, while they are on the date, why she is in Florida. He accepts what she tells him and offers to help her. Of course he only helps because he is interested in her himself.  He comes up with the idea to compete with James J. Jamison for Diane, by getting a boat to compete with him in the boat races. He meets ""Sam Burton"", played by GARY MERRILL, who is also there for the BOAT RACES , but the boat he had entered in the race the prior year had begun breaking up under pressure. Scott/Tom bargained with Sam to allow him to try to fix up and reinforce the boat so that he could race it. Sam accepted the offer and offered to split the winnings if the boat wins.

In the meantime ""Tom/Scott"", is spending loads of money,  buying everything he's never had and trying to impress the ladies. He winds up hooking up with ""Sally"", played by SUZIE KAYE. She appeared in other of the same type of movies , with titles like: ""WILD, WILD WINTER"", C'MON, LET'S LIVE A LITTLE"" AND ""IT'S A BIKINI WORLD"". Scott/Tom manages to fix up the boat enough to enter it in the Boat Races. He does win, prompting him to switch back to his true identity. He plays ""TAXI"" for Dianne, in an attempt to reveal who he really was. When she finds out who he really was, she faints while they're in the middle of traffic, leaving a line of cars behind them, blowing their horns.

This was SHELLEY FABARES'S third film with ELVIS PRESLEY. She also Co-Starred with him, first, in ""GIRL HAPPY"". Then next in the film: ""SPINOUT"". This was BILL BIXBY'S first film with ELVIS. The second one was: ""SPEEDWAY"". SHELLEY WAS THE ONLY ACTRESS WHO CO-STARRED WITH ELVIS, AS HIS ""LOVE INTEREST"", IN THREE OF HIS FILMS. SHELLEY WAS ALSO ELVIS'S  FAVORITE FEMALE CO-STAR. BEACH FILMS WERE REALLY BIG IN THE 1960'S. It would seem out of place if somehow ELVIS had missed out on that genre. I like this repackaging. The artwork on the Cover is much prettier than when I bought my copy. I suppose it's not the cover, but the contents. This movie was made before ELVIS MARRIED PRISCILLA. This movie isn't quite Forty-Nine Years Old, Yet. Today, just like millions of other ELVIS FANS, I WISH I COULD HAVE VISITED GRACELAND TODAY. MAYBE NEXT YEAR.",1471305600,,3294,4.565143824027073

all of the Elvis movies are musicals just not the
Sound of Music type of musical. No matter what
people say Elvis was a pretty good actor and I
believe you can even see glimpses of his true
personality in some of his movies, I have grown
to appreciate the look and feel of movies done
in the 1960s. And this includes most of the Elvis
shows. I like the way people had they're hair and
the way they dressed, pretty much everything
about the 50s and early 60s. The leading ladies
of the 50s and 60s are more attractive than the
current generation, at least in my eyes. So if

I had to change the ratio aspect on the television to get the ""widescreen"" to fill (on the normal full aspect, the ""widescreen"" was a rectangle in the middle of the screen with gray bars down each side, as though it were made to fit into an old-fashioned console); the color was extremely muddy, and the sound was blurred.

Boy was I wrong!

As you put the disc into your DVD player, you are immediately drawn into a film world that is of the highest quality. The opening scenes involve Presley himself driving a car through the Everglades while he waves casually at fishermen in airboats at the side of the road. These exquisite scenes immediately caused me and my family to spontaneously stand up and start applauding. It was sheer Elvis induced joy.

As the movie continued, I could no longer hold my emotions and began to sob. The part when everyone at the beach party was singing, ""Mama's little baby loves Clambake, Clambake, Mama's little baby loves clambake too,"" was just too gorgeous.  Good thing we had a pause button on our remote, because I was out for like an hour!

After the movie finished, I spared no time in immediately selecting the re-play button on my remote. In fact I watched Clambake SEVEN TIMES IN A ROW, NONSTOP! Now I even have the Clambake soundtrack downloaded on my IPod!

894979,5,6304479662,"It you want a top review of ""Clambake"", then read the four and five star comments.  If you are down on Elvis to begin with, you'll want the one and two star reviews.  Let's face it, Elvis was one of the greatest talents in the 20th century.  Had the Colonel not controlled him, he would have made the films he wanted, and in fact, he  was a top choice for several top pictures.  Be that as it may, his singing, from rock 'n roll to gospel, is beyond compare.  There are better Elvis films than ""Clambake"" but,  I am personally prejudiced and you may want to read no further unless you like Hollywood stories.

One of the dancers in this film, who sparkles in her few scenes, is Angelique Pettyjohn (Gloria).  A Las Vegas native and showgirl, she was best known for the ""classic Star Trek"" episode, ""Gamesters of Triskelion"".  She had the female lead as the beautiful and sensitive Shahna.  (Mispelled on some DVD labels as Shanna.)  Her role made her a most popular guest at conventions, which is how we met her.

My wife and I ran media conventions for thirty years and she was our most popular early guest.  We had her as a guest twice, and she stayed over both times to help raise money for scholarships and to visit classrooms.  In my wife's kindergarten class she did face painting since it was close to Halloween.  Much safer for small kids out at night than masks.  She also visited my high school classes and conducted drama workshops.

In one class she particularly talked about ""Clambake"".  Elvis was very down to Earth and just what every fan believes or wants to believe.  One time he came over to her and a couple other dancers and asked if they minded if he tried out a new song.  Naturally they were thrilled and he serenaded them.  Afterward he asked their opinions.

Toward the end of her short life, Angelique was a ringmaster for ""Circus Circus"" in Las Vegas.  She died of cancer and left much memorabilia to us to sell for the scholarship programs she supported.  I talked with her by phone, one of the last nights of her life.  We live in Virginia and couldn't be with her.  She wanted us to know that she had given her life to Jesus Christ and was ready to go.  This lady was a blessing to all of us.

If you really didn't like reading all of the above, remember, you were warned.  I just want to say that this DVD is worth owning for Angelique alone.",1190678400,14,2373,4.376146788990826
894980,3,6304479662,"Although it has the worst title of any Elvis movie, ""Clambake"" (1967) is actually one of his better films. Which is surprising as it is one of his last and generally speaking each film seemed a bit worse than its predecessor. ""Clambake's"" salvation is certainly not in the soundtrack which is at best very ordinary, only the title song has any energy. Although there is an actual clambake scene on the beach about midway into the film, it seems thrown in just to justify the title, more impressive is a cameo of ""Flipper"" who had his own television show at that time.

I'm inclined to credit Shelley Fabares for the good vibe I got from this film. She plays ""golddigger with a heart of gold"" Dianne Carter, Elvis' ultimate love interest. I never cared for her uptight Mary Stone character on reruns of ""The Donna Reed Show"", and therefore paid almost no attention to her until recently. But since seeing her in ""Ride the Wild Surf"" and ""Clambake"" I've had a major attitude adjustment. ""Clambake"" was the third time she was tapped for the love interest role in an Elvis film so obviously she and the King had grown comfortable working together.

Their romance is a little different than the Elvis standard. In ""Clambake"" she does not start out hating or ignoring him. Instead they quickly become friends and she is obviously attracted, but she puts the brakes on any romance because she is hunting for a rich husband and has tycoon J.J. Jamison (Bill Bixby) squarely in her sights. She comes around in the end and their chemistry actually feels real, much like it did with Ann Margret in ""Viva Las Vegas"".

The comfort factor is also apparent between Elvis and Will Hutchins, his real-life buddy. Oil tycoon Scott (Elvis) pulls a ""Prince and the Pauper"" and swaps places with drifter Tom Wilson (Hutchins). He wants to find someone who loves him for himself. Hutchins is supposed to provide the film's main comic relief as he enjoys the life of the rich and famous, driving Scott's ""Munsters"" inspired convertible and surrounding himself with gorgeous women who can't dance very well. Although the director had Hutchins overplay the part it is so poorly written that they can't squeeze many laughs out of the premise. But having most of his scenes with Fabares and Hutchins seems to have relaxed Elvis considerably, which makes both he and his film more likable.

Contrary to most, I enjoyed the corny playground scene with the little girl who was afraid of the slide. The ""Confidence"" song is not a rip off of ""High Hopes"", the whole scene is a variation on the ""Bounce Right Back"" number Donald O'Connor did in ""Anything Goes"". While ""Confidence"" is not much of a song, this surreal scene is priceless. I wonder what long-time fans thought as they watched Elvis and Hutchins do something so totally ""Guffman""?

A few of the songs aren't so good, but the title song done during the Clambake scene was fun.
Elvis made this movie for a payday because he was buying the ranch in Mississippi. It's obvious that he didn't want to be there, but in some scenes he ""faked"" it real well.
The thing I have noticed about Elvis' movies in 1966 and 1967 is his weight. His face appeared slightly bloated, and his waistline was just a little bigger than normal, just enough you could tell it. By 1968, though, he trimmed up and geared up for his comeback special.
Clambake, though, doesn't deserve all the bad rap it gets. The story line has an interesting twist with Elvis, the son of a millionaire oilman, switching places with a ski instructor to see if someone could love him as a person and not as a bankroll.
Another plus is Shelley Fabares. She is absolutely gorgeous in this movie! Even prettier than she was in Girl Happy.
Throw in solid performances by Bill Bixby and James Gregory, have some pretty dancing girls on the beach and the boat race at the end, and Clambake is a solid effort. Out of Elvis' 33 movies, I would consider this in the middle of the pack, about 14th or 15th.",1007942400,5,1281,4.364016736401673

As others have noted, it doesn't appear that a lot (if any) restoration of the film has taken place here. The opening credits in particular are pretty rough in places, but I think that's because those scenes were shot with a mobile camera from an aircraft (perhaps in 16mm), so they look a grainy in comparison to the rest of the movie. Once the action starts within the film itself, the picture quality is generally quite decent.
