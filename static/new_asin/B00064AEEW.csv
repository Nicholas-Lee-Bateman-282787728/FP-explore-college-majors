8038315,1,B00064AEEW,"This movie purportedly is ""harkening back"" to the great gialli of the '70's, in which a mysterious killer is slashing (usually beautiful) women up, and anyone else who happens to blunder onto the scene.  The only problem here is the most beautiful female of them all, the investigator, only suspects not is all it seems, but never seems to do much, even though hamstrung by her superior.  The other female victims and participants are not very attractive, either in looks or personality, and the story does not help at all.  Without spoiling the ""surprise"" ending, I must say it was one of the biggest letdowns of them all, that left me scratching my head.  Avoid.",1414368000,,664,4.747826086956522
