1901474,4,B0000A2ZNS,"I'm giving this DVD 4 stars for a great story selection from a great show. On this DVD, you get some of the best stories from Oswald including ""Sammy Starfish Live"" (in which Oswald meets and performs with his idol), ""Goodbye Best Friend"" (a touching story about Oswald's friend Henry) and many more stories. I was going to give it three stars because I thought they had cut out the closing credits, but it turns out that all of the closing credits play at the end of the very last story.

As far as the DVD itself, the special features are very lacking. You get one game that involves simply looking at a still picture and then trying to find various things based on text and objects. There are also previews, which thankfully can be easily skipped. As far as previews go, they're not too bad. There are trailers for ""Rugrats Go Wild"" and ""The Wild Thornberrys Movie,"" as well as promos for this DVD itself and other Nick Jr. DVDs.",1098403200,,932,4.450292397660819
1901475,5,B0000A2ZNS,"This DVD is my three year old's very favorite!  We watch it everyday!  There are 8 episodes in this DVD.  It's great for her attention span.
If you've never seen Oswald, you don't know what you're missing!  Oswald and his friends are amusing even for adults!  There is nice soft music in the background.  This is such a great dvd, my daughter has memorized all the little songs that Oswald sings and performs them for family and friends!
Get this for your preschooler, you won't be disappointed!",1068854400,6,495,4.632183908045977

1901491,5,B0000A2ZNS,"My kids love Oswald. The older ones grew up watching this show on tv and now that I bought the DVD the younger ones can continue to enjoy Oswald. Characters are good representations of real life- they make mistakes, and grow from those mistakes. Unlike other kids shows (I'm looking at you Fireman Sam) the characters don't repeat the same bad behaviors. Just a fun little show, and your kids might enjoy watching these characters be kind to each other.",1455926400,3,453,4.675

1901502,5,B0000A2ZNS,I love Oswald. The cartoon has bright fun colors and fun plots without being overwhelming and annoying. Oswald and his friends have the movement to keep a little one's attention but it is also calm and relaxing. I much prefer these Dvds to the newer cartoons.,1404864000,2,259,4.6521739130434785

1901504,5,B0000A2ZNS,"I was so glad to come across this show on dvd. My daughter loves it, but it no longer comes on Nick Jr.

It's a bit strange, nevermind the fact it's a talking Octopus with a pet dog that looks like a hot dog on a bun. Or the fact that his best friend is a penguin (voiced by the guy who played Squiggy on Laverne & Shirley). Or the walking talking ""Daisy""...Or the Egg Twins...Did I mention there's a bus that looks like a loaf of bread?

Very imaginative.

Best of all, it's a quiet show.",1394668800,,489,4.020618556701031
1901505,5,B0000A2ZNS,"My 3 year old grandson just loves this movie.
Adorable characters and cute story lines even get my attention.
It's funny watching him acting out the parts along with the movie.
I will look into another Oswald production and hope it matches the entertainment of ""Welcome to Big City"".",1393459200,,283,4.795918367346939
1901506,5,B0000A2ZNS,"This is a great TV show for small children. It teaches how to be nice, helpful and honest as well as looking both ways when you cross a street and common childhood experiences like getting a 1st hair cut. I have a 2 year old with autism who loves this set. He particularly enjoys the different songs that Oswald sings in each episode. I say go for it if you have a little one, its very gender neutral and easy to love!",1392681600,3,418,4.109756097560975
1901507,5,B0000A2ZNS,"Oswald is a fun, gentle, slow paced video that teaches kindness to even the very young. I enjoy letting my daycare children watch and feel good about what they see in this video !",1392595200,,179,4.294117647058823

1901509,5,B0000A2ZNS,Bought this for our granddaughter who LOVES Oswald.  He is a kind and caring octopus that demonstrates good character and polite manners. A calm animation versus a high energy one.,1388188800,,180,5.0

1901511,5,B0000A2ZNS,Good ol Oswald. What can I say bad about Oswald? Nothing. My daughter (2) loves this show I enjoy it as well. There are some strange shows out there and some SUPER annoying. It's a nice show that is calm and can be enjoyed by everyone. I only wish there was more.,1367452800,,263,4.076923076923077
1901512,4,B0000A2ZNS,"I bought this for my daughter for a camping trip.  Our cabin did not have the extensive Oswald collection on DVR as we do at home, nor did we have cable. It went well and I will be taking the dvd and portable dvd player to the beach this summer.",1361404800,,245,3.9
1901513,5,B0000A2ZNS,"Luckily, my daughter loves Oswald! She is almost 3 and is familiar with the up-to-date programs for this decade. Most of these programs are very loud and flashy. This is my go to DVD when nap time is approaching, CRUCIAL",1360972800,,220,4.525
1901514,5,B0000A2ZNS,Another wonderful world with Henry and Daisy in some place where everything is good. Soothing before bedtime and quiets the troubles of a day for a child.,1356912000,,154,4.7407407407407405
1901515,5,B0000A2ZNS,"Sometimes I have a hard time sleeping, and one night I was up late and flipping through the channels in bed.  I stopped on Nick Jr. and started to watch this adorable cartoon.  I felt happy, relaxed, I loved the characters.  I woke up my daughter and brought her to bed with me (lol) and she loved it!  I finally had to turn it off (it was late) and she didn't seem very happy.  I bought this DVD right away and I love when my daughter asks if she can watch Oswal (she does not make the d sound when she says it, so cute)  We don't do a lot of DVDs or tv, she also likes to watch Strawberry Shortcake, but I could watch Oswald on my own (in fact, I was caught watching it alone hahah) I really enjoy watching it with her.  Strawberry can get on my nerves pretty quickly.",1329177600,2,770,3.9934640522875817
1901516,4,B0000A2ZNS,"There was a time not so long ago that either this or the other Oswald DVD was played every evening before bed time. He is still beloved in the house and requested when the three-year old sees the disc album. Mom and Dad don't mind playing this one, it winds us down after dinner and is a good substitute when you are too tired or busy to read a bed time story. The disc menu is a bit odd, the first episode selection page has four episodes, and to get to the other four, you have to go to the ""Bonus"" episode page. (This might be because it was first released on VHS?) Anyway, the episodes on this disc are:

1. Daisy and the Duckling
2. The Double Date
3. Chasing the Ice-Cream Truck
4. The Camping Trip
B1. Henry Needs a Haircut
B2. Flippy the Fish
B3. A Sticky Situation
B4. Tutti Frutti Pie

Visually simple and pleasing, with lovely and well-composed music, it nonetheless delivers some profound life lessons. Perhaps I should have titled my review ""The Zen of Oswald""...?",1270598400,7,977,4.362637362637362
1901517,5,B0000A2ZNS,"My kids watched this on noggin everyday, but they either removed it from the channel or to another time of day so they don't get to watch it. I was glad to see it on here. Its a very simple yet kid-catching dvd. My kids love it and they range from 1 to 5.",1251936000,,255,3.740740740740741
1901518,5,B0000A2ZNS,"My son and daughter love Oswald.  They watch it nonstop.  With it's unique characters and storylines, you can't help but agree.  It is unfortunate how it got pushed aside for other cartoons of lesser quality like Max and Ruby.  (NICK JR. ARE YOU LISTENING?!)  ""Nick Jr."" abandoned this series, but fortunately ""Noggin"" has taken up the bar.

That being said, the DVD is a great compilation of Oswald's episides.  This second DVD actually outshines the first, ""Welcome to Big City.""  If your child (or you) loves Oswald, then I totally recommend this DVD.  If you don't know what the buzz is about, then pick it up anyway and see what it's all about.

How can you lose at this price?",1224028800,3,682,4.608333333333333

1901521,5,B0000A2ZNS,Thank you so much for your perfect services. I ordered Oswald just 2 days ago and this morning it was delivered.

1901522,3,B0000A2ZNS,"The little kids get a kick out of Oswald and his friends. He's a little odd, mabey, but sweet and cute! These movies are all very wholesome and character building. Kids 4-7 most enjoy this movie.",1213056000,,195,4.444444444444445

1901524,5,B0000A2ZNS,"There are so few shows out there that do not bombard small children with too much action, obnoxious noise, inappropriate dialog and constant scene changes.  Oswald is a rare find.  Cute humor, good stories ... can't miss!  With degrees in Child Development, Education, and Psychology, along with a teaching credential, there are at least a handful of people who value my opinion!!",1173744000,3,380,5.096774193548387
1901525,5,B0000A2ZNS,"Oswald is, quite simply, the best children's show ever.  The characters, the colors, the drawings, and the wonderful music!  My kids have just adored this show.

1901528,5,B0000A2ZNS,"Like another mom here, I had all the shows taped on my DVR - until I didn't one day!

Thank heavens for these DVDs... It's too back that Nickelodeon and Noggin cancelled this show - my daughter loves it, and it's something her Dad or I actually like watching with her.

Once you get past the weirdness of the character concepts, it grows on you like nobody's business!",1135987200,2,368,4.397058823529412

1901534,5,B0000A2ZNS,"I'm so angry with Nckelodeon for hooking my one-year-old on this show, then only creating 16 10-minute episodes. She is obsessed with Oswald, and I have purchased every last thing I could find, but I wish there was more. This video is half of the Oswald episodes, and keeps her occupied for about an hour. Love it!!!!",1127952000,2,317,4.578947368421052

1901537,5,B0000A2ZNS,"We caught an episode or two on Nick Jr. when my son was just shy of 2 (I must admit I thought it was so stupid; an octopus, snowman, a daisy & eggs as characters???  Pears as cars????  Who'd watch such a silly cartoon?)  Then my son started watching it everyday & I got to know the characters, he's going to be three soon & he watched Oswald faithfully every day until Noggin & Nick Jr. took it out of both its time slots.  No, big deal for me I had all of the episodes TIVO'd until one night I accidentally erased them!!!!  YIKES!!!  It was a major disappointment for my son. I rushed on-line & got the two DVDs for him & hope they come out with the other episodes as well.  This cartoon is great.  Every kid should watch it.  The main character, Oswald, is polite & always looking out for the other characters.  Its definately a cartoon that you can feel safe with your kids watching!!!!",1126310400,6,889,4.207100591715976

My Tivo is full of old Oswald episodes from when my first born was a toddler, as my kids HATES the current Nick Jr line up.  If you are a recent parent who never got to see these Oswald episodes on T.V. you should get this video.  It is one that you will not mind watching for the one thousandth time with your toddler.

Little did I realize just how much we would all come to love Oswald. When friends visit, even the 6-year olds want to watch Oswald as it is funny, clever and very sweet. If like me, you'd like to protect your child from violence and abusive language for as long as possible, Oswald is your man!
