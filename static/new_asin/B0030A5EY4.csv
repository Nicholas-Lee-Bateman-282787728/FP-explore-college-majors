8385571,3,B0030A5EY4,"Review is for the Grapevine 2002 / 2012 DVD release. Jumpy as all heck and much poorer quality than expected. Audio is weak and muddy and has  very odd yellowish / red hue tinting. The darker red tinted scenes in ""hell"" fare better, but i still hope there is a fresh restoration for this soon. It is long overdue.",1508889600,,313,4.305084745762712
8385572,4,B0030A5EY4,"GRAPEVINE VIDEO is a DVD-R manufacturer with an impressive catalog of the rarest silent and early sound movies.

Their 66 minute version of ""Maciste all'inferno"" (1926) is well short of the film's original 95 minute running time. Background score of dubbed from vinyl orchestra or organ recordings matches screen action fairly well. GRAPEVINE's transfer of this cinematic antique may be pieced together from two sources, as some portions look better than others.

Bart Pagano's Maciste is the prototype for innumerable Euro Hercules muscleman epics of the 1950s and 60s, although here he appears in fairly modern garb.

In an impressively surreal story, after Maciste rescues an infant from the clutches of Old Nick, he's captured and brought to the nether regions, where a kiss from one of Beezelbub's babes transforms him into a demon with superhuman strength. Using his newfound muscle, Maciste allies with Pluto and conquers Curlybeard and his syncophants (who on Earth are dressed in 'nyah-ha-ha' capes and twirly mustaches). Pluto changes Maciste back to a man but on his journey home, an infatuated Proserpine kisses our hero and once again he's a demon! Who will save Maciste now?

Along the way we see flying demons and beasts of all varieties, including Minos, Nimrod and a titanic Saturn cannibalizing his own young. The hellish crowd scenes are most memorable of all. A highly recommended motion picture, especially for silent era fans.

Also included--

A BIRD'S A BIRD (1915) - One of several KEYSTONE Mr. Walrus comedies that stars Chester Conklin. In this one-reeler, Mrs. W. is Minta Durfee (aka Mrs. Roscoe Arbuckle). Also in the cast: Al St. John (Arbuckle's nephew), Alice Davenport as W's mother-in-law and gangly Slim Summerville.",1281484800,6,1752,5.195035460992908
8385573,5,B0030A5EY4,"MACISTE IN HELL is one of my favorite silent films. It features the best cinematic representation of the swirling chaos of hell I've ever seen, complete w/ demons and lost souls! It is a 1920s supernatural adventure even Dante could be proud of! A must for any / all silent fanatics!...  P.S.- DVD-R...",1269907200,3,302,4.69811320754717
