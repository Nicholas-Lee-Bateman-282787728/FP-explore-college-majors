1918074,5,B0000CABIS,"I Love this DVD set.  Sarah Ivanhoe is one of the best video instructors I've ever had.  She goes slow enough for everybody to get it, but not too slow.  She's very encouraging throughout it all.  I'm not athletic at all and I am certainly not flexible, but she makes it fun and reassure me that it's ok.  The Dummies tips and icons let you learn a bit about yoga and it's just a lot of fun.  I would recommend this to anyone, but especially those of us that aren't very athletic or flexible.",1077408000,34,492,4.180851063829787
1918075,5,B0000CABIS,"I am a non-athlete (and overweight) all my life, but came to yoga with spritual needs about five months ago.  I am not a spring chicken either, so you can imagine how out-of-shape I was...  I thought I should start with Dummies series.  I bought them separately, but now I see them as a 2-pack and I think this should be great for somebody who really want to start from the beginning.  Now I own several yoga DVD's and go to yoga classes regularly, but I still consider Sara Ivanhoe one of the greatest instructors.  She has a non-judgemental, yet encouraging and thorough way to introduce you to the world of yoga.  Too often in classes, instructors throw names of poses at you (sometimes in sanskrit) without giving you enough explanations.  I still go back to these DVD's once in a while and understand the explanation even more each time!  Overall I think the DVD's deliver what they claim.",1071273600,83,894,4.578616352201258
7998716,5,B0000CABIS,"Of all the ""beginner"" yoga DVD's I own, this set is the most basic, yoga-101 workout of them all. Sara Ivanhoe is my favorite yoga instructor. She has a soothing voice and these routines move slowly and methodically so you never feel like you can't keep up. She teaches proper form/posture for each movement as well as modifications if you are inflexible. She also teaches the importance of proper breathing during the workouts. I wasn't sure I could deal with the ""Dummies"" pop ups throughout the lesson but they actually are very informative and not all that disruptive. After you've learned the movements and are ready to move on to more advanced routines, these DVD's are great for when you just need a good stretch or a slow, calming workout to get back to center. I purchased a used set at a great price.  Highly recommended for the absolute beginner.",1523664000,,857,4.713333333333333

7998718,5,B0000CABIS,"This is Ms. Ivanhoe in her early days. Later she probably couldn't have made a video this simple because of how deep she went into  yoga. But here she is so incredibly inviting to really anybody who can sit in a chair, and ready to support you as you start to return to flexibility. It's unique in staying away from difficult moves like so many others can't see to avoid, while at the same time preparing you mentally and physically for what's coming up. I first saw her on youtube, but this DVD set is super convenient and great quality. I'm over 50 and nearly rigid in some areas, so I keep returning to her descriptions for help (memories--not the actual video). And she really is pretty in a girl next door kind of way, so you won't mind watching it repeatedly and hearing the ""dumb"" comments that this series inserts (ex. ""yoga is not a religion"" duh).",1392681600,,857,4.424050632911392
7998719,5,B0000CABIS,"This is the best way to learn yoga for a beginner. I would recommend it to anyone. And if you want to go further there are two more workouts, intermediate and advanced.",1301184000,,168,4.28125
7998720,3,B0000CABIS,"This video is great for the person who is just beginning yoga and wants to learn technique and the effects of the moves.  After a couple of viewings though, all of the discussion causes it to move rather slowly.",1286755200,,211,4.410256410256411
7998721,5,B0000CABIS,"This is like your own private one-on-one yoga for beginners class.  The instructor gives you indications on what the poses are, how to get into them, how to stay in them, how to get out of them.  She also gives you options on how to make these poses easier or more challenging, depending on your skill level.  Yoga is not a one size fits all discipline.  There are no other people shown in this video doing difficult poses that a beginner cannot do (making you feel inadequate) - just the instructor.  It's very comfortable.  To enjoy yourself to the fullest, I do recommend that you have at the ready your: DVD remote control, yoga mat, pillow/towel, yoga strap, and a chair.  This way you can go though the DVD without serious interruption and really get to take in what is happening.  You'll enjoy it without having to run around the house looking for those things.",1198195200,6,868,4.554838709677419
7998722,4,B0000CABIS,"If you are new to yoga then you need to start with this dvd.  This is a good introduction for yoga.  There is no vinyasa flow or anything like that, just a basic start of the poses.  There are times when it might seem a little silly, but if you are somewhat inflexible (like I was) then you ought to start with this video.  From here, I would advise going on to Seane Corn videos.  Again, start here if you want to start doing yoga.  Sara Ivanhoe offers plenty of variations if you are unable to do the poses as she demonstrates them.  Enjoy!",1148256000,4,542,4.153846153846154
7998723,4,B0000CABIS,"I began using these DVDs as a novice to yoga.  Deceptively simple at first.  Despite my increased strength and flexibility, these DVDs are my favorites.  My only objection is that I wish there was a way to turn off the cueing.",1106006400,14,226,4.463414634146342
7998724,5,B0000CABIS,"These two DVDs comprise a good introduction to yoga for beginners. The instructor works slowly through the postures, explaining the techniques and benefits. Each DVD contains twelve postures. The first DVD includes basic postures, while the second DVD contains more advanced postures and also a 15-minute primer on meditation.

I found it quaint that the instructor finds the lunge position more challenging than the tree position (balancing on one foot with the other foot against your thigh). I am not sure if this stems from misunderstanding of the difficulty of the postures or it may be just a glitch in editing, but by and large, these DVDs are certainly worth their price. Recommended for beginners with no prior knowledge of yoga.",1101427200,26,738,5.099173553719008
7998725,5,B0000CABIS,"At this point I've done this yoga routine 3 times, and I can I already feel the physical and mental benefits of the practice. This is a very good DVD for someone like me who'd never done it before.",1092614400,26,197,4.076923076923077
