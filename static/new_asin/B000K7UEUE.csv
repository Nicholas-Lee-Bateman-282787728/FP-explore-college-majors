However the show is very energetic, the sound is amazing, and I love the bonus music videos which btw I uploaded to youtube as high quality as possible because the existing videos are blurry and crappy so just search for Hate eternal Solo Ripper and that should bring up my uploads. Anyways I had this dvd before and somehow lost the disk. However for $1. I got it back and this time I made sure I have plenty of backups. I lose everything. Just a great show. Not much more to say. =)",1467331200,,614,4.168067226890757
8154727,4,B000K7UEUE,Good show just seems a little empty in the venue. Also good xtras included especially for the price I paid(5 bucks I think),1453507200,,123,4.391304347826087

8154729,5,B000K7UEUE,"MAN WHAT A KILLER CONCERT !! While the pic is nothing to write home about -dark and grainy and shot with just four cameras- the filming is superb given the conditions at the show; it would appear that more than 4 cameras were used and the focus is on Ruthan's BC Rich flying V fretboard whenever the ocassion calls for. I would have loved to see more of the bassist but he is playing in the dark so shots of him have been kept to a minimum.

The musicianship is incredible and the band is so tight it squeaks ! The sound is loud, near-perfect LPCM stereo -I could have had the snares louder in the mix but you can't have the cake AND  eat it, right ? Concert clocks in at 58'and your ears won't be able to take anymore, guaranteed.

Extras are 3 music videos with perfect sound which mainly consist of the band playing outdoors or at different locations, no big budgets there but you get to compare their studio sound with the live versions, which are surprisingly different. There's a cool but short interview and a 30' feature of the band taking us through a tour of the Mana studios in Florida in which he shows and speaks about the equipment they use to record their stuff.",1266537600,,1177,4.316742081447964
8154730,4,B000K7UEUE,"I give this DVD 4 1/2 stars, and reason i don't think is a 5 is the live footage, all the work with camera angles and stuff could be better,this also includes the image resolution. The audio mix, it's not bad at all but no other choice than the default audio of the performance (good mix though).

Now, the performance of the band is amazing, pure top class DEATH METAL, very talented and passionate musicians, and one of the reasons that made this tour possible was the incorporation (with short notice)of drummer Reno Kiilerich who proved to be guy for the job!

The extra material is cool, nice interview, videos and behind the scenes at Rutan's MANA studios.

Go buy it, and enjoy.",1250380800,,685,4.5528455284552845
8154731,4,B000K7UEUE,"Generally this was a good dvd. The live footage is high quality, but the bass guitar is recorded low in the mix. Reno (the new touring drummer) fit in well. Everything else sounded good. The extra footage is cool, but Derek Roddy isn't in any of it.  For me that was a huge disappointment even with his recent departure from the group.

However I would recommend this dvd to any death metal fan!",1176163200,4,395,4.397260273972603
8154732,5,B000K7UEUE,"OK,When I heard that H.E. was putting out a DVD without drummer Derek Roddy,I was pretty nervous because I really didn't think that they would get somebody who could fill his shoes,boy was i wrong new drummer Reno Killerrich [I think thats how it's spelled],is unbelivable he actually pulled it off!!,in such a short amount of time he learnd some of the most Technical/Brutal metal around and made this DVD what it was meant to be  A NON OVERDUBED DEMONSTRATION OF PURE VIRTUOSITY....OH YHEA,I almost forgot Eric Rutan did not use a second guitarist so it's a three piece with him playing rythm and lead guitar!!,and in a death metal band that is VERY,VERY DIFFICULT TO PULL OFF!!.But he does it masterfully. SO ALL HAIL HATE ETERNAL!! [IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH FOR OTHER BANDS TO OUT DO THIS DVD,IT'S UP TO MORBID ANGEL AND NILE,LETS SEE WHAT HAPPENS.]COOL BONUS ON THE TOUR THROUGH MANA RECORDING STUDIOS,BEHIND THE SCENES AND THE INTERVIEW.WELL DONE,BUY IT!!!",1170547200,4,957,4.871165644171779
