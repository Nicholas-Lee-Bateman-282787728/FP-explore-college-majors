8240254,3,B00113ZDRK,"This is a fast paced dark comedy aimed at a younger generation. It is not as good as ""Chumscrubber"" but certainly worth a view if you like that type of film. The film shows the same day's events from the views of three different main characters. They go to school, score drugs, and attend a party.

Tommy (James M. Hausler) is a very moody teen living in the shadow of his brother Richard (Michael Mandell). Sasha (Eco Lopez) the seductive, slutty, head cheerleader who can have anyone,but wants Tommy who is not that interested. Richard has it all together and unlike Tommy, he is not obsessed by his step-father. The teachers all love Richard and not all in a platonic fashion.  Richard's best friend is the privileged Colby, who looks like  Justin Timberlake acting like Eminem. He reads ""High Times"" and has a lava lamp. Clearly a confused person who has too much money.

After we see the day's events from these three people, we get a fourth person, a minor character that ties it all together.

The film is a ""me-too"" clever dark comedy. It struggles in its efforts to be original and quirky. Certainly worth watching if you can't get enough of the new trendy high school dark comedies.

8240255,4,B00113ZDRK,"Film about three high school teenage boys.  Two of them are brothers who are polar opposites in the way they socialize, dress and interact with people.  Their fatehr is absent and mother seems to be too busy working overtime in order to provide for the family.  With too much time on their hands and not much to do, they experiment with drugs.  It seems that drugs bring up supressed feelings there boys have for (or is it against each other): jealousy, anger, sexual repression all perculate until it's too late.

One would think that this is typical coming of age movie with the usual high school plots and rivalries until the very end that is shocking and heartbreaking at the same time.",1235260800,2,690,4.622950819672131
8240256,3,B00113ZDRK,"the beginning of the film was--well it had a ""first film"" feel to it. It could have been better, even though there were some artistic approaches. i was turned off by that aspect, but as it progressed, i came to see i was watching something different. there was heart in this story and some interesting artistry. the performances were fun and seemingly green, but worked well. once you get to the end, you will wonder how did this story take this path or is this even real? taken for a ride! hopefully my campus brings in more interesting pieces like this..i was compelled to write the review because A: I never heard of it and B:  it felt asian. enjoy",1205625600,,651,4.425
8240257,4,B00113ZDRK,"This film had a screening at my college and it had a solid reaction. Film groups generally rip apart indies as best they can. It's just the way we roll, but I think the general consensus was that this was fresh and pretty enjoyable. The acting was rough around the edges at first, but the film has kind of a satirical feel to it, so anything over the top is easily swallowed. It just felt so colorful and strange, like a fever dream you can't forget.",1205193600,,450,4.244186046511628
