3820635,5,B001VC995S,"If you are pregnant, you CAN NOT go without this video.  Keri and Summer have a wonderful way of capturing what is important throughout each trimester. (each semester comes with a different workout) super helpful. Being a second time mother, their express workout fits in wonderfully with our hectic schedule. The full workout is wonderful, when daddy is around.  Knowing that both of these women are mothers themselves, and seeing the shape that they are in.....is definately a huge motivator!(wow...Keri!)  If you are pregnant, or know of anyone that may be pregnant in the future..... THIS IS THE GIFT TO HAVE!  Thanks for putting out such a great video!",1251936000,2,657,5.0
3820636,5,B001VC995S,"This video is awesome.  I am just starting my third trimester and I can't wait to switch to the third workout.  (This video comes with a different workout for each trimester).  I also love that I can do a full workout when I'm feeling up to it, and on days when I have less energy I can do the express workout.  Plus, Summer are Keri make working out at home fun!  It's like working out w/ friends in your living room.",1251849600,4,418,4.111111111111111
3820637,5,B001VC995S,"I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine who is pregnant with twins.  She sent me a note thanking me for the gift of healthy babies.  Because she stayed fit, her delivery was relatively easy and she looks great!  This DVD is a MUST for anyone special to you who is pregnant.",1251763200,,278,4.0181818181818185
3820638,5,B001VC995S,Exactly as described. Thank you!,1471392000,,32,5.6
3820639,4,B001VC995S,"I've only used the third trimester portion of the workout, so I cannot speak of the first two work-outs. I like the workout; it is plenty easy to keep up with but still gets the cardio going a little bit. It is a light workout, I'd say. The only thing that I would prefer is that the workout not be a duplicate of itself; in the third trimester workout at least, it is about 50 minutes and they do a warm-up, a set of exercises, then repeat the same exact circuit of exercises before the cool-down. It'd be nice to do a different circuit rather than repeating the same thing as that easily gets boring, especially on something so light.",1466553600,,636,4.308333333333334
3820640,1,B001VC995S,"They keep saying ""you guys"" so many times I could not continue my work out. So irritating.",1465776000,,90,4.352941176470588
3820641,4,B001VC995S,"I felt healthy and fit during my pregnancy because of this DVD. It was a bit too easy, but I was thankful for that in the last few weeks. It helped keep my core strong and I felt prepared to give birth. I bounced back postpartum very easily and was ready to get back to working out.
This can be used for all fitness levels. (I was sick for the first 3 months and was able to begin working out again with this DVD after recovering).",1465776000,,431,4.023255813953488
3820642,3,B001VC995S,"I liked the second trimester workout and the option to do a longer one or a shorter one, but the third trimester workout is super short and kind of whimpy, especially if you've been working out the entire time.",1458259200,,210,4.410256410256411
3820643,3,B001VC995S,Good!,1458172800,,5,5.0
3820644,5,B001VC995S,I love the workouts! And its sectioned by trimesters!,1457654400,,53,5.0
3820645,5,B001VC995S,"I loved having this to use during my pregnancy. It is a great workout, and it's nice to be able to see a pregnant woman doing the moves along with you. It was also nice to have something to do in my own home!",1457568000,,208,3.75
3820646,4,B001VC995S,Other reviewers are right: Summer's interjections are really annoying. The workout itself is fantastic. This should have been labeled correctly with the actual instructor's name.,1456531200,,178,6.16
3820647,4,B001VC995S,Have only tried 2 of the workouts so far but really have enjoyed them both!,1456185600,,75,4.066666666666666
3820652,5,B001VC995S,I am enjoying this video. It is a nice workout that covers a lot of different areas and has different exercises for each trimester. I was used to exercising before pregnancy and I feel like it keeps a pretty good pace.,1455926400,,218,4.341463414634147
3820653,4,B001VC995S,Great workout.  Would have given 5 stars but found no mention in description that workout is done with bands.  But easy to improvise with hand weights.,1455926400,2,151,4.769230769230769
3820654,5,B001VC995S,I wish I would have ordered this the moment I found out!!!!,1455580800,,59,4.0
3820655,5,B001VC995S,"My favorite prenatal workout DVD. The exercises felt safe but challenging, and I like that there were different options available as I progressed through my pregnancy. I initially thought I would tire of Ms Sanders patter, but I actually preferred her to others featured on similar DVDs and I found her partner's instruction helpful. The visuals were pleasant and well produced. I think it is imperative that you check with your own doctor, and I do not presume to give health advice here, but I felt this was one DVD that followed the fitness recommendations of my doctor for SAFE stretching, strength training and aerobics.",1454976000,,625,4.961904761904762
3820656,5,B001VC995S,They rev me up and calm me down. Love this video!,1454284800,,49,3.5454545454545454
3820657,5,B001VC995S,This is a great pregnancy DVD. It gives you 3 work outs for each trimester. It helps you modify as you can't lay on your back. It included work outs that will help with labor. You can even use them while you labor. This isn't super intense but it doesn't need to be since you are pregnant.,1451433600,,289,4.087719298245614
3820658,5,B001VC995S,"I've never worked out to a video before but decided to start in pregnancy to make sure I was doing safe workout. They kept a great pace throughout the video, breaking it up into workouts for each trimester, and always offering an easier approach to the more strenuous workouts.

I would recommend!",1450742400,,297,4.711538461538462
3820659,2,B001VC995S,"I opted to purchase anot her video after doing this one twice. I would only recommend for end of pregnancy or if you were severely out of shape prior to becoming pregnant. Also, I didn't feel comfortable doing the sit ups she suggested... was h opine for some better core exercises.",1447804800,,282,4.549019607843137
3820660,5,B001VC995S,Easy to follow! Very fun and upbeat! Great for anyone like me that doesn't work out a lot! Still using it at 35 weeks! The instructors are easy to follow! Wonderful experience. Will be recommending to my prejudger friends! Will also be continuing to use this after the baby is born! Thank you!,1446163200,,293,4.547169811320755
3820661,5,B001VC995S,Loved this DVD! It got me through my entire pregnancy & kept me feeling fit and healthy. Very motivating...and not annoying like some exercise videos can be! I've recommended to many moms to be.,1445990400,,194,4.735294117647059
3820662,3,B001VC995S,"I love workout videos, since the gym is far from my house and I have kids it's not easy leaving, so when I was pregnant with my 3 baby I wanted to try this dvd, I've always stayed active during all my pregnancies, but this DVD did not work for me, I got bored of it, which normally I don't with other videos, and the girls in the video didn't seem to take the workouts serious.",1445212800,,377,3.973684210526316
3820663,5,B001VC995S,My absolute favorite prenatal workout DVD. Summer Sanders is very positive without being cheesy or over the top. Th best!,1444780800,,121,5.1

3820665,5,B001VC995S,"This was a great exercise for my big, massive pregnant self. Too bad I am lazy and stopped using it.",1440979200,,100,4.05
3820666,5,B001VC995S,"I'm so glad I purchased this DVD. It helped me stay fir throughout my pregnancy. I even passed it on my friends who were expecting and they loved it too.
The exercises are trimester wise and I only did those I could do.
The cooling down was good  too.",1439424000,,251,4.122448979591836
3820667,5,B001VC995S,"I am in my 7th month and have used this workout from the beginning. At first, I didn't really feel like I was getting a good enough workout but once you let yourself realize you got a little baby in you, this is all you need strength-wise. I like how it's directed to life after baby too in the types of strength sets you're given to work the muscles you'll use most- arms/shoulders for holding baby!  Seriously enjoy this so much and actually look forward to doing it every time!",1439337600,,480,4.333333333333333
3820668,5,B001VC995S,"This DVD is a must-have for me during pregnancy! I actually just bought it again b/c I gave my first copy to a friend after my last baby was born. It contains an express workout that is about 20-25 mins and does wonders for me! I have gestational diabetes so I need to exercise daily, and this is great for days when it's too hot to walk. I've also noticed that doing the exercises regularly really helps with the various aches and pains of later pregnancy (achy back, etc) and I even sleep more soundly! Can't say enough good things about it!",1438560000,,543,4.333333333333333
3820669,3,B001VC995S,Was pretty boring. Didn't feel like a good workout. Would probably be good for people that aren't allowed much activity while pregnant. Also like others have said it is pretty annoying to listen to the two ladys.,1438473600,,212,4.756756756756757
3820670,3,B001VC995S,"Shipping was super fast! I got it within a week! The workout is not so tough though & I've never been much of a workout freak... It's very repetitive (mainly squats & some arm workouts) so it gets sort of boring after a while..I personally enjoyed Lindsay Brin's workout better it has a bit more variety! Overall, its an ok workout to get you moving during pregnancy...",1436400000,,369,4.522388059701493
3820671,1,B001VC995S,"From an Olympian, I expected a more challenging workout. It should be noted in the product description that this workout is for newbies or people who don't workout regularly. Additionally, her attempt at being humorous came across as uninspiring and cheesey/corny.",1435881600,,264,5.463414634146342
3820672,5,B001VC995S,"Such a awesome video, I didn't want to review until I've been doing it awhile.  The lady's are easy to follow, the workout is a slow pace but effective video.  I'm five months pregnant and my dr says my weight gain is excellent.  My legs and butt are tighter and right now I'm all baby.  I'd recommend this workout to any mama trying to stay in shape.",1435276800,,351,4.1940298507462686
3820673,3,B001VC995S,Its ok. Would be happy if they had more upper body weights. They really concentrate on abs and bums in this DVD.,1435017600,,112,4.136363636363637
3820674,2,B001VC995S,"The express workout is 34 minutes, including the warm up and cool down.  The warm up is 9 minutes long and has a lot of static stretching.  The cool down is 6 minutes long.  There are a lot of side lunges in this workout.  An exercise band and pillows are needed for the workout.",1434412800,,279,4.111111111111111
3820675,5,B001VC995S,"I was able to do this workout throughout most of my pregnancy.  It was both gentle and easy to follow, but it definitely made me sweat during some parts!  It definitely helped me to stay at a healthy weight during pregnancy as well.  Plus, I got really excited when I saw that the lady in it was from the show Figure it Out haha.",1434067200,,329,4.109375
3820676,1,B001VC995S,"Did not like. Its annoying enough to see 2 people working out, and on top of that her physician keeps helping her set up. Sorry, I only workout alone and I don't have people setting my pillows. Also, I did not appreciate her tone sometimes.",1433894400,,240,4.355555555555555
3820677,4,B001VC995S,The workout is a great one while pregnant. I am very active so this helps me keep up with my fitness. Once you have done the workout many times the girls do get a little annoying. Especially with the delays but it is very worth it. I like how each trimester gives you something new.,1433808000,,282,4.1454545454545455
3820678,1,B001VC995S,This wasn't yoga as I expected - rather a lot more movement and lotion vs still positions,1431993600,,89,4.294117647058823
3820679,5,B001VC995S,These were great workouts while I was pregnant.,1431734400,,47,5.0
3820680,2,B001VC995S,"I'm a very healthy and active young woman, and I didn't like this video. It's long and it's not well structured. Like.. They make you work with bands, then you do squats or something on the floor, then you stand up again, use your bands... I do a LOT of workouts on video at home and I just didn't really like that one. It's also too easy in my opinion.",1431648000,,353,4.057142857142857
3820681,5,B001VC995S,Love this workout DVD!  I have done the first trimester and second trimester videos and love them both.  They are challenging and I feel like I am getting a good workout unlike some other pregnancy DVD's.  Summer and her SIL are really cute and funny and make the workout go by in a flash.  Highly recommend.,1430956800,,308,4.446428571428571
3820682,3,B001VC995S,"This DVD uses the resistance  bands, my wife got a medium band and she said it was a a lot of resistance. It's a good DVD to do throughout the pregnancy.",1430265600,,153,3.935483870967742
3820683,2,B001VC995S,Too much of doing the same movements and variations of those same movements over and over and over... Boring but my muscles did ache. But not something I want to do often. Bummer.,1430179200,,179,4.454545454545454
3820684,5,B001VC995S,"I was afraid this would be peppy and annoying (I am a moody pregnant person). I really enjoyed it, the workouts were enough that I definitely felt I was ""getting something"" from them. I appreciated that there was a full length and express version to pick from. Even doing the same work out for the whole trimester (almost every day) I didn't get bored or annoyed with Summer and the music. In fact I found her genuinely cheery and appreciated the upbeat mood.",1429920000,,459,4.542168674698795
3820685,5,B001VC995S,"I did this workout a bunch while I was pregnant.  A good workout with a lot of adjustments and modifications for your stage/fitness level in pregnancy.  The instructor is sweet, has a sense of humor, and is not annoying, a deal-breaker for me with home fitness videos.  I liked that she was actually pregnant and not a once-pregnant-but-now-very-ripped instructor.  Highly recommend for women who exercise but are not crazy fit (it might be too easy).",1429660800,,451,4.973333333333334
3820686,4,B001VC995S,"Good video.  They have positive commentary, but like any workout video, the comments can get old.  I like the separate workout for each trimester and the express 35 min workout is perfect to squeeze in before work.",1428796800,,214,4.756756756756757
3820687,2,B001VC995S,"Very nice workout, you only need to put the tv on mute as I found her comments very annoying, used to bug me like hell",1428105600,,118,3.76
3820688,5,B001VC995S,Loved working out with this video. Fun and refreshing. It was challenging yet you weren't over stressing. Makes me smile to think about how cheery they were. Def recommend.,1427673600,,172,4.9655172413793105
3820689,2,B001VC995S,Boring workouts.,1426550400,,16,7.5
3820690,5,B001VC995S,"Love it. helped me keep in shape and totally prepped me emotionally, mentally, and physically. Honestly, I think one of the exercises helped me as I labored at home to being 5 cm. Also pay close attention to the breathing because that helped me through the contractions.",1425859200,,270,4.76595744680851
3820691,5,B001VC995S,I loved this DVD while I was pregnant. The different sections for each trimester was great. I didn't use the first trimester much because I was still doing most of my regular exercising but as I got bigger it was great! This and ten minute prenatal Pilates were my goto while pregnant and I felt great the whole time. Being able to work out at home at the end was exactly what I wanted.,1425772800,,386,4.22972972972973
3820701,3,B001VC995S,"I like this workout, but there are several things that bother me about the video.
1.  The trainer almost never tells you an actual number of repetitions to do per exercise.  You just have to follow Summer and try to start and end when she does.  That gets a little tricky when you're first using the video because Summer usually starts the exercise before you are even told what to do.  Sometimes the trainer even asks Summer what number she's on, to which the response is a facetious ""101"" that is not very helpful in keeping up with how many reps you SHOULD be doing or, if you're following Summer, how many you have done.
2.  I like the trainer, but I find that Summer's dialogue gets very annoying the more you watch the video.
3. There is no down time between exercises to get set up for the next one, so unless you have a trainer available to hand you your workout band or prepare pillows for you, you'll either have to pause the video a lot or play catch up after the next exercise has started.
4. There are very few ""chapters"" on the DVD, so if you want to skip a single exercise or the whole minute of child's pose after pushups, you have to fast forward instead just skipping to the next chapter

The workout is good, I like the level and intensity.",1425513600,,1259,4.291139240506329
3820702,4,B001VC995S,"So this is one of three prenatal videos that I purchased and the only one that had three separate workouts.  The first workout is very challenging I was pleasantly surprised.  I will say that the long workout is the short workout with a repeat of the routine minus the warm-up and cool down.  This doesn't bother me but it might bother some people.  Also, Summer does talk a lot so if you don't like banter than I wouldn't recommend this dvd.  Overall I liked the separate  workouts and the third trimester section is a lot easier than the first and second but it's still a workout and I am not tempted to over exert myself by looking at non modified moves.  I find that now that I'm in my final month the other two dvds can be too challenging for my giant belly with their all in one routines.  This one was a keeper for me and I can see myself using the first trimester routine after pregnancy.",1425427200,,896,4.291666666666667
3820703,2,B001VC995S,This video was way too long and the ladies were unprofessional.  Too much chatting and thought they were annoying.  Did the workout once and it stayed on my shelf the rest of the pregnancy.,1425168000,,189,4.529411764705882
3820704,4,B001VC995S,"Great workout, but too much for me during my pregnancy.  All I could manage with the back pain and nausea was swimming, but other women may be able to do this.",1424736000,,159,4.129032258064516

3820709,3,B001VC995S,"I like the format of this exercise video - you can do a shorter or longer workout and there are different exercises for each trimester. It is a great work out if you were an average on the fitness scale pre-pregnancy, but if you are advanced, this will probably not be enough for you. My one complaint about this video is that there is a lot of silly banter, and after using this for the past 8 weeks, it is grating. I still use it but turn the sound off.",1424131200,,455,4.066666666666666
3820710,4,B001VC995S,"I only give this 4 stars because the conversation is a little annoying and I wish there were better music in the background. However, I LOVE the way it makes me feel when I'm done!  I feel like I am safely exercising while also toning.  Much better than other videos I've done- and time flies by pretty quick too!",1423699200,,313,4.288135593220339
3820721,5,B001VC995S,"So far I'm only in my first trimester, however, I can promise you that if I stick with this program, I WILL be in shape for birth!. I was a little surprised at how good of a workout it is! I will also add that the two women in it have a good relationship that keeps it from feeling to serious or impersonal. Would definitely recommend it to someone who was working out prior to pregnancy.",1423353600,,388,4.118421052631579
3820722,3,B001VC995S,"It's okay, but you need resistance bands, which I didn't have. Nothing ground breaking, but it was okay for rainy days when I couldn't walk.",1423267200,,140,4.64
3820723,5,B001VC995S,Love this workout. Summer and Kerri did it again. I feel like it's a good workout without overdoing it. And I like that the workouts are trimester specific.,1423267200,,156,4.607142857142857
3820724,1,B001VC995S,"The back and forth is really annoying between the 2 women. The warm up felt way to rushed and almost like a workout itself, not a warm up. I don't think I'll be doing this more than once a week, if that.",1422921600,,203,3.857142857142857
3820725,4,B001VC995S,"I really enjoy this workout.  Don't forget to make sure you have the exercise bands!  I somehow missed that and was bummed because it completely changes the workout, as you would expect.  Anway, I find it challenging without being impossible.  I exercised pre-pregancy, but I think this would work for all exercise levels.  You can modify certain moves to make them easier or harder.",1421884800,,383,4.921875
3820726,5,B001VC995S,Absolutely love this DVD work out!!!! Summer Sanders is great!!! I love how they don't make it boring and always joke around and it doesn't get quite. I hate boring work outs this one is perfect!!! Love love love love it!!!!!,1420675200,,225,4.512195121951219
3820727,5,B001VC995S,"Love this video!!!! Just started doing the second trimester workout, after doing the first trimester for about 4 weeks! It's a great workout for people that have been active prior to pregnancy, it's a good full body workout that you will feel great after completing each time!",1420588800,,276,4.8936170212765955

3820729,2,B001VC995S,"Thank goodness I bought this video from a second hand store. I find it painfully boring and as others have said, the banter between the two ladies is really annoying. I started off using 10 Minute Prenatal Pilates (which I still LOVE!) and then moved on to Suzanne Bowen's Sim and Toned. I wanted to switch it up with another video but this will not be the one. First of all, you need a stretch band to do this. I ended up just using my free weights since I wasn't sure if it would be worth it to get a band since my other videos don't require them. I found the technique to be mediocre. I kept modifying to increase the difficulty (and I'm not even in that great of shape!) the way Suzanne Bowen recommends. I would much rather do those videos because I feel more of a burn and they are more relaxing because there is no banter. I guess this is an ok video if it's the only one you have but I definitely wouldn't recommend it if you have other options to choose from.",1420416000,,968,4.154255319148936
3820730,3,B001VC995S,"This workout is okay. I'm guessing that if you were not working out prior to getting pregnant this would be a nice, gentle workout, but to me it was just boring. She goes through very basic kinds of arm exercises using a resistance band, a couple of leg exercises--also very, very basic and easy--and some tummy work that I skipped entirely. This is not a cardio kind of workout at all. There are moments when there is some movement at the very beginning, but nothing that would get your heat rate up if you are in any way in shape. I'm in the middle of my second trimester right now, I can imagine that at the end of my third trimester this workout will be a welcome break from my normal workout routine. As I mentioned they use a resistance band, but free weights could be substituted.

3820735,4,B001VC995S,I have a total of four prenatal workout DVDs ranging from Barre to Pilates. I think it is important to note that you need to buy the band for this workout. I got mine (medium resistance) at a big box store for around $6. You could use weights for most of the exercises except for the side kick outs with resistance band. I like the weight training/resistance idea of this video. I don't find it particularly riveting. I wish they included a cardio segment. I give 4 stars because it is a good total body workout for someone with a beginner to moderate fitness level. This will continue to be in the rotation and this can also be used postpartum.,1417392000,,645,4.383333333333334

These two workouts provide a well rounded exercise routine, and prevents me from getting super bored with either one. I like the Perfect Pregnancy one because it is more challenging than this one, and provides excellent strength training/toning.

The DVD combines stretching with some strength training, and it gets my heart rate elevated. I like that it is broken up by trimester so that you have a separate work out for each stage. I also like that there is a full length and an express option depending on how much time I have that day. It can get a bit boring doing the same workout each time though. next pregnancy I'll get a couple other workout DVDs to mix things up.

I did this workout during my second pregnancy and then became a certified personal trainer. I developed diastasis recti (separation of the abdominal muscles) that has limited the exercises I am able to do postpartum. I have since learned that crunches and planks are an absolute NO NO during pregnancy. There are PLENTY of safe ways to work the core without doing crunches, but for some reason this video includes them. Some may be lucky and not develop DR but in my opinion... Why risk it? Totally bummed that this video probably contributed to the development of my DR that I now spend a ton of time healing.",1410912000,4,727,4.6

I almost always do the express workout version due to time constraints but still find it challenging enough.  I have also liked that the exercises changed by trimester, which has prevented me from getting too bored.

The only reason I don't use it as much with this pregnancy is I have a toddler now that demands most of my time so workouts are not as frequent. During my first pregnancy, I decided to buy prenatal workout videos because I workout on my own and run, but felt that I might push myself a little too hard. These videos are excellent because they constantly remind you about your form, how you know if you're getting a good workout or too much of a workout and obviously the focus isn't on getting in shape, it's on being a healthy pregnant lady. The workout is fine, but honestly I love the video because I enjoy the ongoing dialog from Summer. She seems very down-to-earth, sometimes she even complains, but not in a way that brings down your motivation. The back and forth between Summer and Carrie keeps me entertained, even after multiple viewings. If you like the idea of a group, but don't have the time for a workout, you feel a little like you're working out with a couple of your girl pals in this video and that makes it more enjoyable.",1403913600,,1148,4.2949308755760365

3820769,3,B001VC995S,"First about me: I worked out pretty regularly before pregnancy, but am not super buff or advanced.  I do like a good strength training workout though.

About this workout.  It is a pretty good workout and seems appropriate for pregnancy.  It might be a little easy for me if I hadn't gotten out of shape in the first trimester due to constant morning sickness, but for where I was headed into the 2nd trimester it's kind of perfect.

The cons for me are two:  1. That the express workout is like 35 minutes and the full is 50 minutes.  I'd rather the express be no longer than 25.  2. That there's no difference between the express and full workout except for repetition in the full workout.it basically repeats the main workout portion a second time once you've gone through it one time.  I like DVDs better when the express and full workouts are distinct because: 1. it adds variety to your workouts so you get less bored and possible work different muscles.  2. You don't get as tired of the silly banter included in the workouts.  3. Repeating the same exercises doesn't give you much bang for your buck in terms of toning other than extra calories burned. So that's where this DVD falls short for me.  I'm definitely already getting a little bored and have only used a half dozen times.

Bottom line.  You can get this DVD, but you'll have to get others to keep your workout varied and prevent boredom.

That's this gal's opinion!  Hope it helps!",1403395200,,1451,4.523076923076923

There should also be modifications shown for people who do not want to get on the floor with 10 pillows behind them to do abs.

Summer's comments can be goofy at times, but in a good way: it keeps it light.  Keri is very professional, and I find her exercises beneficial without being super strenuous.  There's a good mix of cardio for the warm-up, strength-training with a resistance band in the middle, and stretching for the cool-down at the end.

It's a great workout for stretching and easing some of the neck and back pain that I get after being at work all day. There's an express and full length workout for each trimester. I mostly use the express one after work before dinner and I feel great afterwards.

3820790,4,B001VC995S,"this is a good video to keep mixing up my workout routine, i don't really like that they repeat the same exact sequence twice, and i hate to say it (maybe it's just me?) but Summer Sander's is annoyingly chatty through the whole thing. overall it's worth the buy though, it's challenging enough without being exhausting. each segment is about 50min but there's also an accelerated option if you need a quicker one.",1395014400,,414,4.684931506849315
3820791,5,B001VC995S,"I wish I had gotten this earlier in my pregnancy. It's a really great strengthening workout AND it helps relieve muscle tightness and muscle cramps.

This is my first pregnancy. I had been running 4 or 5 days a week, 3-5 miles a day, before morning sickness and fatigue knocked me flat in the first trimester. I did yoga at home during the first trimester, but nothing too strenuous. At about 11 weeks, I started to feel less nauseated and I had more energy. I thought I was going to return to running and do that for most of the rest of my pregnancy. I was wrong. I tried to keep running but my body refused, and I figured that if there's any time I should really be listening to my body, it's now. I started just walking, but walking didn't feel like it was enough of a workout. So I started looking for prenatal exercise DVDs. This one is fantastic.

You do need a resistance band to do this. I bought ""Exercise Variable Resistance Band 5-level Latex Tubes - Set"": http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XUVA4O/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. You only need one band, but I didn't know which resistance I'd want to use, so I got a set. I'm using light resistance, but I hope to move on to medium as I continue to use this DVD.

The exercises are fantastic. The DVD includes lots of squats and lunges, which I'm sure are preparing me for labor and delivery. They also loosen up my pelvis and back and just feel good. The workout also strengthens my arms and back. It works triceps, biceps, and various back muscles as well as muscles in your pelvis and legs. I only do about 35 minutes of the full-length workout, but I'm working my way up to the full thing. If you want a DVD that works out your muscles to the point that you feel it the next day, this one's for you.

I will update this review when I move into the third trimester section.

Note: I bought two other DVDs from Amazon at the same time. I tried ""Amira's Belly Dance & Yoga For Pregnancy"" and hated it. It is too kooky and new-age, even for this yogini. It was also not intense enough to feel like a workout. I also got ""10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates,"" which I really like and which I use regularly. I shall review both on their product pages.",1394928000,4,2224,4.454545454545454
3820792,3,B001VC995S,I worked out to it the whole time I was pregnant. I liked Summer Sanders and the way she talked about being pregnant and exercising. I feel like it kept me much healthier than I would've been otherwise,1394755200,,201,4.315789473684211
3820793,3,B001VC995S,I love yoga and when I got pregnant i needed to find a new yoga dvd and i decided to get this. It is a good workout but not at all relaxing which is what i was hoping for. The workouts for the third trimester were very difficult as they required getting up and down much pressure on my back. i did enjoy some of the workouts but being pregnant there is alot of anxiety and i find most yoga dvds to be relaxing but this is far from that.,1394755200,,436,3.8555555555555556
3820794,4,B001VC995S,"I love the fact that this workout has one for each trimester and it has express workouts for the days you just feel awful.  Summer is a bit goofy, but it seems to pass the workout fairly quickly.  The 3rd trimester seems it could be a little more intense for my taste, but I loved the 1st and 2nd trimester workouts.",1394496000,,316,4.163934426229508
3820795,4,B001VC995S,"The workout is great, not too harsh, but not easy either. I wanted something more competitive and not too easy and light and this was perfect. The only reason I gave it 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because I wish there were more than three different workouts, one for each trimester. I can't do it too often because it gets too boring and repetitive. Some people might like that.",1394150400,,377,4.323943661971831

3820797,3,B001VC995S,"This is a true sweat workout.  More fast-paced then I wanted in my exercises, but if you are looking for a real workout while pregnant, this is for you.  I was looking for something that dealt with relaxation, stretching and breathing and this was not what i was looking for.  I will probably use it after the baby is born to get back into shape.",1393545600,,346,4.292307692307692
3820798,4,B001VC995S,"I enjoyed this workout. The best thing about this workout was that it got my blood flowing, and included strength training. I didn't have a resistance band, so I modified with free weights and a yoga strap. A negative - for me - with this workout is that it was a little rough on my knees with the lunges, etc., but I'm going to take it easy and hope that increased strength and flexibility will help. The leg stretches at the end were really great! There seemed to be a lot of things at the beginning to hit ""next"" through when I first put the DVD in. Hopefully, it will not do that on the second viewing. I would definitely recommend this workout, especially if you don't have any knee issues. If you have knee issues, or you are not in very good shape or having a rough time with pregnancy, you might ease into things with the most gentle prenatal yoga DVD you can find, but I would encourage you to try this, as you get used to exercising, to get into better shape before you get too far along, so that you can have an easier labor.",1393459200,,1036,4.211055276381909

I really missed strength training during my first pregnancy; I was lost and scared without someone to show me the appropriate modifications for my changing body.  This is changing all that.  I feel super confident working with this DVD.  I also love that the ""Express"" Workout is still a solid 30+ minutes of work.  These ladies make sure you don't cheat yourself out of a good thing!  Far superior to Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga DVD (which totally bored me) and a more challenging complement to Suzanne Bowen's Long & Lean Pregnancy DVD (if you like pilates/barre).",1393459200,,656,4.761061946902655

3820803,5,B001VC995S,"I love this workout video, especially the third trimester part of it!  I really enjoyed doing the different portions of the video during the different stages of my pregnancy.  My only complaint is that the ab work included in the 1st and 2nd trimester videos I'm not sure is what doctor's still recommend for pregnant women...  I was told not to do any crunch motions or planks during pregnancy because it can cause the abdominal muscles to rip.  That aside, this video is a great way to get active and get a workout while pregnant.",1392336000,,532,4.568421052631579

3820806,5,B001VC995S,"I was against buying a ""prenatal"" workout because I thought they were all yoga and low impact moves that wouldn't do much. Summer has her personal trainer right next to her the entire time walking her through moves that I would do even after baby comes. I was almost 7 months pregnant doing the second trimester workout and I loved it. I felt like I was doing a regular workout like I would at the gym but it was just a tad easier on my body due to the type of moves. She does drink a lot of water through it too and coaches you to breath, tighten your baby belly and drink water as well. If you have not stayed in shape during your pregnancy or haven't kept your muscles toned, this is not the video for you. I was going to the gym five times a week still up until my 7 month, when I decided to go at my own pace and use this video at home. Love this workout and can't wait to continue using even after baby comes.",1392076800,,915,4.005464480874317
3820807,4,B001VC995S,This a great DVD for exercising while pregnant. She slits up the video by trimesters however you can modify all 3 for where you are in your pregnancy. She is 7mo pregnant while doing the exercises so she modifies due to big belly bump which is nice to see and helpful.,1391904000,,268,4.2745098039215685
3820808,5,B001VC995S,"I usually can't stand workout videos but wanted something to show me some modified strength exercises to keep doing during pregnancy.  This video exceeded my expectations.  Kerri Crockett joins Summer Sanders and I wish Kerri would have her own line of videos out.  She has the most defined arms I've ever seen on a lean female trainer.  And they don't have a lot of annoying habits, personality, or seem too bossy.  My husband even joined in with me a couple of times and was impressed by the quality of the workout.  It breaks the work-outs into trimesters, but the great thing is that even when you progress past a trimester you can still go back and do that workout too.  So, basically when you get to your third trimester you have three different workouts to alternate so you won't get burnt out.  Also, for each trimester you can choose the full or the express workout.  The full lasts around 50 minutes (includes warm-up/cool-down).  The express lasts around 30 minutes (including warm-up/cool-down). Remember that the goal of this video is not to lose weight, but it is a great training tool for delivery day.",1391385600,,1117,4.740932642487047

The routine itself is challenging, but definitely doable for someone in decent shape - if you haven't done strength training in awhile, this may leave you quite sore the next day or two, but it's nice to find a prenatal work out that actually makes you feel like you worked out! Many of them are too mild to make me feel any intensity, and I want to be challenged to the point of feeling like I accomplished something when I'm done.  Love this & would totally recommend.  I have only done the second trimester work out so far, but will soon be entering my third trimester so I'll move onto that one (the video is broken into workouts by trimester), and I may come back and edit this if anything changes!",1391126400,,799,4.385135135135135

Once I became pregnant I became lethargic the first trimester and barely worked out (beyond a slow walk around the block.) Everyone is different, but for me, I really like this DVD and it helps me to get a workout in while being pregnant (used it mostly during the 2nd trimester and I just began the 3rd trimester today). It may not be a cardio workout per say, but it is good for your arms, posture, and I enjoy the labor lunges and how she describes everything as she does it. I don't find her to be annoying as other people have said. I think she is pleasant and bubbly without being fake. I also add walking to my workout routine so that fills the ""cardio"" gap that you might feel. You will also need an exercise band for this DVD and a chair, and some pillows.. just something to know ahead of time.",1390348800,2,967,4.348066298342541
3820814,5,B001VC995S,First i'd like to say it takes a few times of doing some of the workouts to get it right but they are so clear on explaining what to do and you really do get a workout if you do the whole 45 minute video. I am in my second trimester and before this i was not very active but now i do this video every other day and i always leave sweating and panting and feeling 10 times better. They really know what work outs to do to make you feel relaxed and less tense but still give you that aching feeling to let you know you did a great job.,1390348800,,533,3.767857142857143

The reviews were good for this so I bought it but..I really thought it was a snooze. Also Summer is super annoying in this video constantly talking about ""2nd trimester"" and ""tons of energy"" which I felt was ironic because this video made we want to go to sleep.

I did it once and then returned to Suzanne Bowen's Barre workout, the Prenatal Yoga (Jennifer Wolfe), and sometimes the Perfect Pregnancy Workout ( not that hard, but I think a great overall workout in 40 minutes) I tend to drift towards yoga, pilates and barre workouts rather than more old-fashioned aerobizing, so if that's you too, I would try others :D",1390176000,,461,5.078947368421052
3820817,4,B001VC995S,"I hadn't been exercising much before I got pregnant, and was SO tired in the first trimester that I just vegged out on the couch.  So, when I finally got motivated to start exercising in the second trimester, I was pretty out of shape.  The first time I did the second trimester workout, it was strenuous but I was able to get through it.  The full-length second trimester work out is a little over 50 minutes - the first 9 minutes is warm up, the first cycle of exercises ends around 24 minutes, the second cycle (same stuff) ends around 45 minutes, and then they do stretching until about 53 minutes.  It takes me about an hour because I need to pause it to arrange pillows, get water, and catch my breath.

I was disappointed that the second cycle of the full-length workout didn't add any new exercises, but on the bright side it helps me build confidence in my ability to do each one. I also thought it was weird that they didn't give pointers about the form for the exercises until the second time through, so I usually do a few things wrong the first time through.  There are a few times when they exercise the same muscles for too long in a row (triceps, and consecutive squats without mixing in upper body).  I don't have an exercise band, so I use 5 pound weights for most exercises, and switch in a 10 pounder for overhead triceps and 3 pound weights for the second tricep workout.  The stretching portion at the end is very weak.  We just did a million sets of squats and we're only really stretching our necks?  No way.  I just stretch my legs while they roll their necks around.

Overall, I do like the DVD (based only on the second trimester portion).  The chit chat gets a little annoying, but I really like Summer's upbeat personality and it makes me feel like I am doing the workout with a friend.  I like that I'm able to do it, but it's hard enough that I feel like I'm really doing something good for my body to stay healthy and prepare for delivery.  I feel like I've accomplished something afterward.  I like that I'm a little sore the next day, but not too bad.  It has been WELL worth 12 bucks for me, and I'm looking forward to switching to the third trimester workout in a few weeks!",1390176000,,2210,4.325242718446602

3820819,4,B001VC995S,"I was looking for something that I could use through all 3 trimesters, that would give me a good workout but not overdo it. I used to work out all the time, but about 6 months before getting pregnant I stopped. Cold turkey. So when I found out I was pregnant I immediately asked my doc if I could start back up again. She said no. The workouts I was doing were just too strenuous and starting to work out when you haven't in a while is a big no no when you're pregnant. I needed something in-between (and I didn't just want to ""walk""..... I'm pregnant, I'm not dead). Enter Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout. This is the best of both worlds-- much more strenuous than just a walk, but much easier than a typical cardio routine. I've been using this on and off for about 10 weeks now (I started in my 2nd trimester) and have managed to keep the weight off. In fact, my doctor asked me what changes I had made because all of the sudden my weight gain decreased drastically. I told her I had been doing this routine catered to pregnant women and she said that was great.

I really like Summer's upbeat personality and she does a good job of explaining why the moves are important. My only complaint is there are really only 3 routines in this whole DVD - 1st tri, 2nd tri, 3rd tri. When I first opened it up, I was excited that there were 3 regular workouts plus 3 mini- workouts. But in fact, the mini workouts were just that-- just half of the regular workouts. I would have given this 5 stars if it had a couple more workouts. You get tired of doing the same routine for 12 weeks- trust me. I can't do it everyday, it's too boring. I've been switching it up with some prenatal yoga and it helps keep me refreshed and excited to use this DVD 2-3 times a week.

I'm now at 30 weeks and it's still challenging but not too difficult. Plan on using this for at least the next 4-5 weeks.",1389571200,2,1880,4.204986149584488

The labor lunges summer said that keri did them in the delivery room and something like ""we've only been doing it for 20 seconds, imagine this for 22 more hours"" - seriously? way to make a pregnant lady nervous. Or talking about contracting during an exercise saying that they meant ""the good kind of contraction - not the bad ones.""

Not a seriously intense one or anything. you really can't be too over the top when you're pregnant about working out. but this one does a pretty good job. not much aerobic; more toning. uses bands, not included. Summer and her sister in law, the trainer, stress throughout that this is not for weight loss; it's for healthy moms and healthy babies. includes 3 workouts, one for each trimester. actually, includes 2 for each trimester...an express workout and a longer workout.

I feel better whenever I include this in my week a few times, as much as I can. *Note: as cheesy as she is, I think Denise Austin's prenatal (even the one from like the 80's!) is a good prenatal workout. She is annoying, but that girl knows how to workout.)  :)",1386460800,,882,4.478260869565218

First of all, the workout is too long for me.  I like to start my workout with 30 minutes of some kind of cardio (walking or elliptical) and when you add in a 45 minute video, the total workout takes way too long. Second, the workout for the 2nd trimester seems very hard for me.  I was really out of breath during the workout. I wasn't sore after, but the pace was a little too fast for my liking. I'll continue doing this once a week along with the other 3 videos that I got, but this is my least favorites out of the four.",1384128000,,673,3.9703703703703703

In some workout DVDs, the personalities can be annoying or ""too fit"" that you hate them a little.  But where Summer is 7 months pregnant herself, and very likable, it made for an enjoyable workout.  You also feel like the workouts are safe and aren't going to hurt you or your baby.  I will say that it did lose its appeal after a couple months just because repeating the same things would get boring.  Plus, you're pregnant, so you pretty much never want to work out anyway... so I didn't end up getting a TON of use out of it.  But I still plan to use it for my next pregnancy.",1383523200,,712,4.1911764705882355

I taught zumba in the first trimester until I got too sick to do it anymore (I kept the jumping and twisting out of my class).  Otherwise, I have been mostly walking throughout the pregnancy and occasionally doing yoga and pilates.  I feel that this workout gives the missing strength training that I need to keep fit.  I don't mind the friendly banter between the girls on the dvd.  I do however find the long amount of promotional stuff a the beginning annoying, so I fast forward that.

So far I have only done the 2nd trimester workout, and I love it! This DVD was EXACTLY what I needed. It's not too difficult (when you do the express workout) but it is challenging enough to feel your body working and getting strong. I would HIGHLY recommend this DVD to all the pregnant ladies out there! You do need a resistant band, but honestly you could probably do the workout with light hand weights instead of the band if you don't have one. I swap out the band for my weights for some of the arms because my band is tight and it's too challenging. Good luck! Here's to happy, healthy babies!",1381104000,,719,4.454545454545454
3820856,2,B001VC995S,"I'm in my second trimester and was looking for at-home videos that would be both relaxing and challenging. I found this video pretty annoying, largely due to what other reviewers have said about the chatter between Summer Sanders and her trainer. It's also important to note that this workout requires a stretchy-band thing (I'm sure that's the technical term)--though I do agree that you could probably just use light free weights instead. Some portions of it did feel challenging (I'm normal weight and probably in average shape), but none of it felt relaxing. I also ordered Suzanne Bowen's Long & Lean Prenatal Workout and definitely preferred that video. Some of this probably comes down to style; if you think you'd like a peppier workout with a bubbly host and more traditional personal training moves, you might like Summer (on mute after a while?), whereas if you tend to gravitate toward yoga and dance-based workouts, you'll probably prefer Suzanne.",1381104000,11,960,5.082278481012659

I was able to run into my second trimester but then it started to hurt my knees and hips. So I was looking for an exercise video I could do 4 or 5 times per week. I bought this one and I couldn't be happier with it. I bought it when i was just at the end of my second trimester.  I have tried the second trimester workout and the third trimester workout - both the full length versions and the express versions (on some rushed, workday mornings). The days when I do this video in the mornings, i feel so much better at night. I feel like I sleep better and have that nice feeling of slight muscle soreness in my arms. I like that my arms are staying toned into my third trimester. I really enjoy this video.",1380931200,,861,4.088757396449704
3820858,4,B001VC995S,I'm 19w4d and so far this dvd is perfect.  It  raises your heart rate but is not too much.  Summer Sanders is funny and seems realistic.  I'll admit I thought I ordered a prenatal yoga video but was not disappointed after I tried this workout.,1380153600,,243,4.333333333333333
3820859,4,B001VC995S,"This was a great workout that I tried to do about once a week during my pregnancy. I got it in my second trimester so can't speak for the first trimester workout, but the second trimester workout was very challenging and appropriate for that time period. I was also very relieved when I got to the third trimester workout because the exercises were modified and a lot more was done in a chair. I liked that each workout has a full and express option - the full took around 45-50 min and the express was about 30 minutes. The express has all of the same things as the full but you only do the main exercises once instead of twice (so the full workout is warm up -> exercises -> exercises (repeat second time) -> stretch and the express workout removes that second set of exercises).

Just an additional thing to note is I felt like this workout is more focused on strengthening your muscles and I didn't get a whole lot of cardio from it (although it did make me sweat!). The warm up does get your heartrate moving but after that you're mostly using the exercise band and doing some abs and squats. It wasn't a bad thing for me but it's definitely not the same workout you'd get from being on an elliptical or running.",1380067200,3,1217,4.337719298245614

My daughter is 2 1/2 and I'm at stay-at-home mom and I felt like I wanted to exercise while she napped. I ordered this DVD and I really do like it. I didn't do much the first trimester because morning sickness made it hard to do anything, so I think I only did this a handful of times. Now that I'm in the 2nd trimester, I'm not nauseous and my energy is back. I use this 3 times a week now. This DVD is great and I feel like I'm truly working on my muscles!

Summer Sanders is adorable with her belly and all of her silly jokes make it easy for you to relate and keep up the pace. I wouldn't recommend this video to any woman who hasn't been working out prior, as it does require a bit of stamina and is a legitimate workout. Please don't go trying to lose weight during your pregnancy! This is strictly a video to KEEP you in shape and keep your energy high to prepare you for the birth of your baby. My boyfriend has joined me at times to support my workouts and breaks a sweat with this video! It's hilarious! This workout is not easy and for the first week or so you will be sore in areas like your inner thighs. This video is great because Summer Sanders takes precaution with the state of your pregnancy and makes sure you're drinking enough water and not laying flat on your back or doing things that are restricted with pregnancy. If you're a high risk pregnancy, please do not get this video.. it is a legitimate workout and won't be good for your situation. The video includes a workout for the first trimester, second trimester and third trimester. You'll need resistance bands and pillows! I would recommend this video to any woman looking to keep her energy high and muscles toned.. so long as your pregnancy is normal and healthy this is a wonderful video for you!!",1378512000,3,1432,4.448669201520913

3820868,3,B001VC995S,"I bought several pregnancy workout videos, and thought it would be a good idea to write a review of all of them at once: Amiras Bellydance and Yoga for Pregnancy; 10 Minute Solutions Prenatal Pilates; Shiva Reas Prenatal Yoga; Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1; Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout.  Let me start this by saying that before my pregnancy, my level of fitness was somewhere in between couch potato and world-class athlete  I usually worked out a few times a week, doing 20-30 minutes cardio and some light weight-lifting, but was not running marathons or anything like that.  I wanted to maintain a similar level of fitness during my pregnancy, while building muscles and flexibility specific to labor and burning enough calories to offset my very increased appetite.  Whether you get one of these or not, my overall advice is that working out during pregnancy really, really helps  it helped me stay more comfortable as I expanded and my center of gravity shifted, it helped me feel good about the changes that were happening to my body, and it helped prepare me for a relatively smooth and manageable labor and delivery (no medication).

Amiras Bellydance and Yoga for Pregnancy: This was one of my favorites, and I think in the long run it really helped prepare my body for labor; it also helped me to relax, stretch, and feel good as I got bigger and bigger.  Some of the reviews here point out that it is not a very intense workout  thats true, but I felt like there was plenty of stretching and strengthening, and through much of my pregnancy high intensity was not what I was looking for  the goal of this video is not to increase athleticism, but to help the body adjust to pregnancy and prepare for labor.  Amira is a very encouraging coach, and much of the commentary is designed to be relaxing, informative, and comforting; I also appreciated that she looked like a real pregnant woman in the video, rather than a super fit, still skinny woman who just happened to have a bump.  The bonus material  interviews and some dance performances  was not all that appealing to me, but I liked Amiras intro statement about her own experience and the history of bellydance.  The interviews might be more interesting/helpful for someone who doesnt have sisters/girlfriends who have been through this before.

10 Minute Solutions Prenatal Pilates: This was another favorite.  I really like the format, where you can choose how many of the 10-minute segments to do, and in what order, and I felt like the workouts were manageable and well-suited to pregnant bodies.  Towards the end of my pregnancy, I was doing the flexibility workout more than the others and often just one or two at a time, but for the first two trimesters, I would usually do three of the workouts at a time.  I was somewhat familiar with pilates already, but not an expert by any means, and I found the workouts easy to follow (with a little practice needed the first few times); I think this would be good for those new to pilates, and the format means that even people who are not used to working out can start off with a manageable amount and work up from there.  The instructor sometimes gives conflicting cues about breathing patterns, but generally she is clear, informative, and easy to follow.  Seeing someone well into her 3rd trimester doing these exercises was very inspiring.  Some of the workouts don't require any equipment, but some require light hand weights and/or pillows.

Shiva Reas Prenatal Yoga: I didn't get this until near the end of my pregnancy, but the few times I did it made me wish I had it earlier.  The pace and level of difficulty are definitely geared towards beginners, and much of the emphasis is on toning and stretching in ways that are particularly geared towards pregnancy and labor (kegel exercises and hip stretches).  This is a very relaxing and slow-paced video  not a killer workout that will leave you sweating and panting.  There are modifications for each trimester, but with many of the moves, I found I could do the 1st trimester version and didn't need the modifications.  It did require some equipment: a yoga blanket (? Not sure what this is  I just used a regular blanket folded up), a strap (I used the belt from a bathrobe), and a yoga brick (this was needed for some of the later trimester modifications  I just skipped it).

Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1: I had read great reviews of this, but was disappointed and only used it a few times.  Basically, it was too strenuous for my pregnant self  the instructor is a world-class athlete and I guess this is the workout she had put together for herself during her pregnancy  nothing wrong with that, but her level of fitness and her fitness goals were just a little different from mine, and I really couldn't keep up.  That said, there were a few moves that I liked and did separately when I just needed something quick (like the labor squats).  I did like it that kegels were built into this.  If you feel you are up to it, it is an intense and thorough workout.  The final section, on preparing yourself mentally by doing an intense endurance exercise, seemed silly to me at the time, and it still seems silly now that Ive been through labor: 3 minutes of arm circles is difficult, but conquering this difficulty will not be enough to prepare you for making it through labor (which can be manageable if you are well-prepared!).

Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout: This video was ok, and definitely offers a thorough workout, but it was not my favorite.  It has three separate workouts, one for each trimester, and you can choose the complete version or an express version for each one (I think the complete version is just the express workout repeated a second time)  I almost always did the express version.  The 1st trimester workout was way too hard for me (I wanted to spend most of my 1st trimester sleeping), the 2nd trimester workout was just about right in terms of intensity, and the 3rd trimester workout was a little too light (for me).  The moves here are fairly traditional and will certainly tone major muscles groups without any frills; I would have appreciated more stretching.  There were a few pregnancy-specific moves that I often did separately (labor lunges, plie squats).  Summer Sanders and her trainer/sister-in-law are encouraging, but their chatter doesnt hold up well and starts to get annoying after watching it a few times.",1378080000,150,6440,4.737219730941704

Unlike other videos I have tried where it makes you feel like you are handicap just because you are carrying a baby.  I worked up a sweat and was sore for the next two days after doing this video. It is not something I would do if I was not pregnant however, but it does state clearly that it is not a cardio workout intended for anything other than a healthy pregnancy.",1377648000,,472,4.186813186813187

I was also pleased to see that Summer is actually pregnant and doing these workouts as well. Granted she does this for a living, but it still made it seem feasible. The DVD is broken out into trimesters then an express workout and a full workout. So far I have only done the express workout which is 35 minutes long. I'm assuming the full workout is an hour long. The workout covers warm up, some light aerobics, strength training with a band and cool down and stretching. Only supplies you need are an elastic band and pillows.

3820872,4,B001VC995S,"I was a competitive swimmer for years, in Summer Sanders' heyday as an Olympian, so when I saw a prenatal workout video with her, I was going to buy it regardless of the good reviews.  But really, this video is a good one, and not just because I am a fan of Summer.  I am an avid half-marathoner and triathlete, and while this video isn't exactly HARD, I feel like I actually worked out.  It is more strength work than cardio which is fine with me at this stage in the game since I am still running and swimming quite a bit.

Summer and Keri do tend to get a little goofy at times, but I like that.  It kind of makes you feel like you are working out with friends in your living room instead of doing some santitized workout video.

The only thing I don't love is the stretching portion - I'd love for this video to have a little more in that department - preferably more labor-friendly stretches such as hip openers and deep squats.  I typically wind up adding on some extra stretching at the end.

You do need a resistance band (the kind with the handles) for this video - I wish I had known that before I ordered, but they are easy enough to find.",1377561600,,1150,4.171945701357466

It's a really comfortable way to feel like you're getting a good workout in.  I've only done the full workout so far, which is a little under and hour long, but there is an Express Workout option too that I'd like to try out on quick days.  It's nice to have that option for sure.

Definitely recommend!

Side note: all you really need for the workout is 4 pillows and a resistance band.  I just use a simple 5 lb band we had around the house and that works just fine.  You could probably do without, but it wouldn't give you as good of a burn as with.",1376524800,,881,4.196428571428571

The fact that they talk through out the work out kinda made it easier as well, It also made me laugh at times too. This work out does require a resistance band with handles. I also recommend getting a yoga mat if you have hard wood floors or tile, like me. Very awesome workout DVD to have while pregnant! Oh, it even comes with a postpartum exercise routine.

Summer and Keri also make it fun and issue important reminders such as drinking water and making sure you can carry on a conversation while working out.

Summer looks to be in her 3rd trimester, and they break the workouts down by trimester.  I did the 2nd trimester even though I'm in my 3rd, and it was doable.  They have an express work out, too, which is great when you don't have as much time.  I plan on using this up until delivery!",1374710400,,636,3.868217054263566
3820892,5,B001VC995S,"I am 22 weeks along. Although I purchased this during my first trimester, I didn't have the energy to actually do anything until just a few weeks ago. Full disclosure: I have only done the 2nd trimester workout.

The resistance bands are a must to get the full benefit of the workout. Work those muscles! You're going to need them when the baby comes and you have to carry the baby, the diaper bag, the car seat, etc. all the time. You can use dumbbells if you have them; I had difficulty going that route since pregnancy has turned me into a butter fingers. I don't want to drop a weight on my foot or anything. Also, I don't have all those pillows, so I use my exercise ball for the parts where she is laying down on the pillows. It works just as well. The important thing is to work out, make all of the modifications you need. It is such a huge benefit to yourself and to your precious baby growing in there!

The two women have a great chemistry. I saw that they are relatives, which isn't surprising. They chat like long-time friends. Summer lets a nice sense of humor shine through a few times. The style is very calm and soothing; as someone who is used to working out to Jillian Michaels, it is refreshing! Also, this is a real workout. I was working on dropping significant weight prior to pregnancy and had built up some muscle tone. It's nice to feel that yes, the muscles are still there. I was sore the day after doing the video the first couple times, and then my body started adjusting. It is basically a very mild circuit routine.

One bad thing is that they do not stress form as much as I would like. They do talk about keeping your abs pulled in, but there is no mention of not letting your knees go past your toes when doing squats. Also, there is static stretching during the warm-up, which seems very odd. Static stretching is best kept for the end of a workout. Another issue is that the transitions between moves is pretty quick. Summer is often already a couple reps into a set before I even get myself positioned.

Congratulations to everyone expecting, and good luck with your deliveries!",1374710400,2,2116,4.39030612244898

The constant, ""witty"" and cutesy chatter between the two women gets pretty old by the third time using the video. Good news is moves are easy enough to learn, so I simply muted the video and listened to some good music! I didn't care for using the resistant band for some of the moves, and might be a problem for people who do not own one. You can use weights for most of these moves, though!

The one thing I WILL caution about is that you need a work out band in order to do the exercises.

It's a good workout with annoying instructors.  I find the two of them to be very similar to the ""Delicious Dish"" skit on SNL with Ana Gasteyer and Molly Shannon.  One issue I have is that Keri sets up the next exercise while Summer is doing the current one - so when the current exercise ends and Summer has everything ready to move on, I have to play catch-up because no one is setting anything up for me.  Also, you could play a drinking game (if you weren't pregnant) with the number of times the two of them say ""you guys"": ""Seriously, you guys,"" ""Think about holding that baby, you guys,"" ""Five more, you guys,"" ""Make sure you're drinking water, you guys,"" ""Good job, you guys,"" ""Keep breathing, you guys,"" ""Sit up straight, you guys.""  I'm one of those people who picks up on that kind of thing and then can't really hear anything else, so to me, it's quite prominent.  A positive of this series, though, is that each DVD has the option of a full-length or an express workout.  The full-length is the express workout twice, but I really like to have the choice available.  The express workouts run about 30 minutes, which is perfect for me.",1371772800,,1299,4.493617021276596

The full length workout just includes a second set of the same exercises you do during the express workout.  Summer and Kerry provide good guidance to ensure proper form and also explain why exercises are beneficial while pregnant.  After giving up on The Pregnancy Project (I have had quite a few sports injuries, including ACL reconstructions on both of my knees, and I found all of the kneeling to be painful and some of the exercises to be too ambitious) I was very pleased to find this video.

It has options for express workout and full length so you if you don't have as much time you can do the shorter one. The express is about 25 mins and the full length is about 50 mins.
I like the strength exercises to tone the arms, however, they spend a lot of time taking water breaks and talking. It's kind of slow sometimes and repetitive, especially if you do the full length because they just repeat the main part of the workout. There's not really any cardio - nothing to get you sweating and your heart pumping! After doing this workout, I don't really feel like I've gotten any exercise. In my opinion, if I'm going to devote that much time to a workout, I want to actually feel like I've worked out!
I think this is a good workout program if you haven't worked out much before, but if you're used to really sweating it out, you might be a little disappointed. It's not too expensive, though, so it's not going to break the bank if you want to give it a try!",1371513600,,1098,4.183962264150943

3820916,4,B001VC995S,"First, I will say that I mistakenly bought this DVD because I searched for 'yoga' and this was the second hit.  My fault for not noticing that the reviews did not discuss yoga, so I was surprised when I played it for the first time.  Regardless, I liked the idea of toning/light weights, so I kept it and have used it about 2x/week since about 11 weeks (currently 26).

Personally, for me this is a light workout.  I use it to fill in on days that I do not run.  As the summer heats up I might be using it more.  I would say that anyone who exercised at high intensity pre-pregnancy will find it easy and beginners might find it a bit challenging, so just put yourself on the spectrum to determine what it may be like for you.  I have used the first and second trimester workouts thus far.  The warm-up/cardio segments are identical, but the resistance exercises are different.  Sometimes I go back and do the first trimester if I feel like doing more ab work, etc.  The second trimester has more bicep and tricep work, so you may find that you want to mix up the trimesters regardless of where you actually are. Summer is 7 months pregnant for all of the trimester workouts, so it's not like it'd be dangerous to go back and re-visit.  The second trimester workout is actually a bit more intense, purposely.

The ""express workout"" runs through the resistance exercises one time.  The ""full length"" runs through them all a second time, in the same order.  I think the express runs about 38 minutes total, including cool down, while the full length is around 50-55 minutes.

I agree that the chatter between Summer and Keri can get repetitive.  I know the punch lines now and roll my eyes quite a bit.

I will continue to use it, but I am looking for a new video now seeing as I have 14 more weeks and need to change things up a bit.",1370736000,,1832,4.341176470588235

3820918,5,B001VC995S,"WHERE IS THE POST-NATAL WORKOUT VIDEO WITH SUMMERS AND KERI???
I would buy it the second it's released!

Ok. This dvd is really and truly awesome and so very helpful. I did it throughout my first pregnancy, and I'm going though with it now in my second pregnancy as well. It makes a good pair with Erin O'Brian's dvd, by the way, which is a bit more challenging.

The great things:
- Summers gives an excellent example. She's 7 months pregnant in this video, and that helps you to figure out how you look like while doing these exercises
- Keri is a great explainer and motivator. Even though sometimes she just says: 'you're doing great' - you actually start feeling better! She also reminds you of common mistakes (""keep those shoulders down!"", ""Are you breathing?"").
- you only need a band, some pillows, a chair, a blanket and water.
- the exercises help you to stay in shape during pregnancy, but they also prepare you for birth, and for holding a baby (""from the nice 6 pounder up to the 21 pounder"" - ladies, you know what I'm saying!)
- every exercise is clear and feels just right
- they offer three stages of intensity (according to the trimester you are in - or how strong you feel), and they offer the express and the full workout

Only negative points
- I don't like the music. But it's so artificial that it doesn't quite count.
- the third trimester workout is a bit too easy for my taste.
- did I mention that there's no postpartum dvd?

It gets my heart rate up and is a good balance of different muscle groups, I don't feel like anything  is getting to much of the focus, and feel as though I've actually worked out when I'm done. I worked out previously to getting pregnant and feel like these workouts are helping maintain my muscle tone despite having to significantly change my workout routine. I would have given this a perfect score, but there are a lot of little comments and jokes made that I could live without made during the video (as noted in other reviews), and there's no option to turn them off. I just mute the TV and listen to my own music and that has worked for me. I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for a decent workout while pregnant. It does require some support equipment such as bands, and a mat... nothing too expensive though.",1368921600,,895,4.4573170731707314

I just used handweights initially but the band helps. Unfortunately, when you do the same workout, you have to listen to the same things said over and over again. You're going to have to hear Summer Sanders say silly jokes like ""I swallowed a pumpkin!"" at least 50 times in the first trimester. Her sister-in-law, Kerri, who really is the pro here, just giggles as if to say ""OK, shut up now"". The best part is when Summer says ""When we were expecting our first babies, we did these exercises. They didn't work very well but it was a lot of fun!"" GREAT plug for your own tape.

That aside, this is so boring and slow. I'm by no means athletic but I'm pretty sure you could be on your deathbed and fly by these moves. I get a better workout walking to/from the DVD player to take the movie out. I have no idea why this has such great reviews...honestly, you're better off just talking a walk around the block compared to this movie. I guarantee Summer Sanders didn't do this workout when she was pregnant in order to stay fit. I guess at best this is something you can do in the final 4 weeks of your pregnancy when you're barely moving anyway.

3820937,4,B001VC995S,"I will update this later, but wanted to leave feedback before I forgot..

I am a 33 yr old, almost 19 weeks... before I knew I was pregnant I worked out about 3-5 days a week, doing.. Running, Bikram Yoga, Pilates, and Body Works classes at LA Fitness. (right before I found out, I was a tad lazy and didn't work out as much)

Now in my 2nd Tri, I started Bikram Yoga again, canceled my LA fitness membership to save money (Bikram Class become costly) and don't really feel like running, I will try once it gets a tad nicer out...

ANYWAY... I wanted something to do on the days I wasn't going to do yoga, or couldn't go.  With summer coming up I figured a couple DVDs will keep the variety.  I also got 10 minute Solutions Prenatal Pilates but haven't tried it yet (years ago I bought on of the DVDS and LOVED it, great way to mix up the work outs if you get bored easy like me)

So Far I did the 2nd Tri Full length workout (about 50mins) and it was GOOD, had my muscles burning, and I broke a sweat.  I used 3 lb weights.  It reminded me a lot like Body Works Class at LA.  with some pregnancy modifications.  If you have ever did a class or DVD work out you will be familiar with all the moves.  I would say this is a great dvd, easy enough for the beginners, but will still give you a burn if your an intermediate. I'll come back and leave more of an review once I do it more and try out the other DVD.",1366848000,,1407,3.9892857142857143

Walking is the only thing to do at the gym now so I looked for something new. I like this workout. The DVD offers workouts for each trimester as well as a full length or express workout for each. Other prenatal workout DVDs are too light and I don't feel like I worked out after. At the end of this one, I felt like I had worked (safely). If you were fit before pregnancy, this is a better workout/DVD than others I have tried.",1366675200,,542,4.171428571428572
3820939,4,B001VC995S,"This DVD is exactly what I was looking for. There are 6 total workouts - a long and a short for each trimester. The only equipment needed is a resistance band, but I do everything with small handweights and they work just fine. The only thing I'm not thrilled with is that the longer workout is just the short one played twice before the cool-down. However, its a simple, full body routine that's fun and gives you energy. I'm pretty fit and I usually just do the short workout (about 30 minutes?) Definitely recommend to anyone. If you are already fit its great, and if you aren't as fit you can easily modify things.",1366243200,,618,4.4298245614035086

3820941,5,B001VC995S,"I'm in my 7th month and have enjoyed doing this workout since the first trimester.  The regular workout is about 45 minutes and there is an express version that is 30 minutes.  I typically do the express version and feel energized and toned when it's finished.  It's comprised of a lot of basic moves that you've done before - squats, sit ups, etc., but there is enough variety and movement that it doesn't feel boring.  The workouts in the first two trimesters are pretty similar.  The third trimester's workout is a little different, using a chair for parts of the warm up and actual workout.

I like Summer's style. She is upbeat, tries to bring humor to the workout, but doesn't overdo it.  Her sister-in-law is the trainer in the workout, keeping things moving and on track.  The workout moves at a good pace and is just the right challenge that I'm looking for.  I feel like I've done something when I've finished, but it is not overly challenging.",1365984000,,954,4.597633136094674

3820944,5,B001VC995S,"I would recommend this for women who were pretty fit before becoming pregnant and who want to continue to do ""real workouts"" now that they're expecting!

I am 31 weeks now and so I have done both the 2nd and 3rd trimester workouts. They are both EXCELLENT. I feel I get a safe and effective cardio workout as well as some superb strength training. (It uses a resistance band). And, the two trimesters have completely different workouts so about the time you memorize the 2nd trimester routine, it's time for a new and totally different workout! (It does come with a 1st trimester routine, btw, I just haven't used or viewed it.) Each trimester has the full workout option or the express workout option. The full workout is perhaps an hour (I don't pay that much attention to be honest). The full workout in both 2nd and 3rd trimesters is challenging and will leave you sweating and sore - but not panting or passing out.  The express versions are about 20-30 minutes long and are still a completely legitimate and intense workout in themselves for when you just don't have the time or oomph for the full workout. All you need equipment wise is a resistance band and a chair. (The 3rd trimester routine uses the chair alot but contrary to what I suspected, it is in no way easier I assure you!) Incidentally, Summer Sanders is definitely legitimately pregnant right along with you and commiserates and chats with you in a really fun manner - like you're working out with a girlfriend. It gives the whole thing a fun, more low key attitude. She's assisted by her (non-pregnant) sister-in-law Kerri, who is a certified personal trainer. And finally, this whole workout was created with the approval of an obstetrician who gives you a short speal if you watch after the workout or click on that option from the menu. (Obviously this could mean very little and you'll still want to discuss any fitness program with your own obstetrician but it made me feel even that much more comfortable with the workout.) This is a must-have for fit mommies who want to keep up with a little more intense exercise in a safe manner throughout their pregnancy.",1365811200,,2139,4.6710875331564985

3820950,4,B001VC995S,"I use this workout 2-3 per week in my rotation. I enjoy Summer Sander's as a presenter and she and her co-trainer have a good rapport. (I can't stand overly perky/annoying trainers). Good mix of legs, core and arms/back. I think they do a good job of stressing the importance of breathing and hydration. They give good instruction and remind you to how to maximize each exercise (squeeze buns, tighten core...) This is not a cardio heavy workout so if you want to be moving a lot this is not going to be your favorite video. But its a good one to have in the rotation.

I like how there is a workout dedicated to each trimester.",1364860800,,628,4.367521367521367

3820953,5,B001VC995S,It is definitely a little advanced for me but I just do the best I can.  I go at my own pace and I really do feel better the next day.  I wake up feeling stretched but not sore.  The dvd really has a pleasant feel to it.  Even though its a work out you feel relaxed like you just did yoga.  I have only done the express workouts because they are about 40 minutes.  I would highly recommend this product.,1364860800,,403,3.9135802469135803
3820954,3,B001VC995S,I probably used this DVD about 3 times. I was so lazy to exercise when I was pregnant. Luckily i didn't gain much wait and i lost it in no time. Seems like a good DVD though.,1364515200,,174,3.72972972972973

Some of the movements are repetitive and the dialogue can be a little corny. But if you are just looking to get moving, give it a whirl.",1364169600,,445,4.373493975903615
3820956,5,B001VC995S,I appreciated that this was divided up into a different workout for each trimester.  They tailored the moves & activity level accordingly. Not many DVDs do that and I think it's really important.  Stuff I could manage in the first trimester might not be so great for the second or third!  I'm not the most athletic person in the world but I'm moderately fit and this was really great for me to stay active even when pregnancy stuff was sapping my energy.  If you're running a marathon in your second trimester you may want to find something more challenging but I just wanted a DVD to get me moving as it's been too cold to do much outside!,1363737600,,640,4.398305084745763
3820957,4,B001VC995S,"This workout DVD challenged me and even left me sore, but was still safe. I liked having a total body workout, and seeing Summer perform the exercises at 7 months (and looking great) was encouraging. It is broken down by trimester, but the majority of the exercises are the same, so the only downfall is it can become boring and you may want to switch it up with other types of exercise during the week.",1363737600,,403,4.386666666666667

#1. Summer Sanders
#2. The Divine Mother Prenatal Yoga Series
#3. Pilates During Pregnancy
#4. the perfect pregnancy workout
#5. Shiva Rea Prenatal Yoga
At first I was rotating through all of my DVDs, but I find now that I just do Summer's video each morning. It is the one I looked forward to the most. On weekends I like to do the Divine Mother as a nice stretch/relaxtion after a week of Summer's workout. Every once in a while I do the Pilates one, because it is really a great workout also. I found the perfect pregnancy workout to be very boring, but it is a good workout. Just hard to get motivated for it because it is so boring. I love Shiva yoga DVDs, but the prenatal one was lackluster.
Can't say enough good things about Summer's video!!!!! I LOVE that it there is a new workout for each trimester and also that you can select either a short or long version of each workout. The girls (Summer and Keri) and fun to workout with and keep things moving. They also stress drinking lots of water, which is sooo important to alleviate stretch marks and of course for your baby. Great workout- I am 16 weeks pregnant so far and feel great. You need a resistance band and some pillows, but that's it! A MUST during any pregnancy, and I would recommend using it from the very beginning of your pregnancy. ENJOY :)",1363737600,2,1360,4.379446640316205

There are different workouts for each trimester, each is about 45 minutes to an hour, and there is a express version of each too. Summer is actually pregnant which is great to watch someone else with a belly do the workout. All you need is a resistance band and some pillows.

Before 20w, I was working out at the gym, walking, running, and doing a group bootcamp class twice a week. Eventually I just couldn't keep it all up and my schedule changed and didn't allow me to get into the gym as much. I felt this DVD was a good switch into something that seemed a little easier than my normal but still left me feeling accomplished. The talking can be a bit much, but I tend to zone out through it. And the music is a little cheesy :) BUT its an okay warmup followed by one-two sets of a mixture of resistance band work for arms and legs. I usually rewound the second set and did another one for three total. I should also add, I have only done the second and third trimester workouts since I bought the DVD later in my pregnancy. I also modified some of the resistance band work with weights where I felt it appropriate. All in all, I felt this was a good workout, especially on the days where I was a bit more tired and not up the doing a full gym session.",1362960000,,1075,4.0754716981132075

Doing a workout with someone who herself is 7 or so months pregnant really encourages me that I'm not hurting the baby and it is possible to move even though I'm pregnant. It has a full length workout which is about 50 minutes but they also have shortened forms of each trimester workout if you don't have the time or energy for a full length workout. I really like it.

1. The music: really!? Who rates a workout dvd based on the music? Honestly, I wouldn't even notice the music except I read some reviews about it. I'm just trying to focus on the actual workout. Anyway, I found the music to be enjoyable, and pretty much right in line with most workout dvd soundtracks. If you don't like it, use your iPod!

2. For women saying this is not a tough ENOUGH workout for them!? Again, REALLY!? I am in reasonable shape and I did the express workout for the 2nd trimester. Let me tell you, I'll be feeling it tomorrow! But I'm not exercising to be at my pre-pregnancy fitness level (that doesn't seem like a healthy attitude IMO). I also wouldn't have the energy to do much more than this. HOWEVER, if you need more of a challenge, just use a regular workout DVD?! And modify it! DUH.

3. Not being able to skip ahead: I have an ancient DVD player and I was able to skip past the commercials NO PROBLEM! You probably don't know how to use your skip features?! On my remote it's the skip forward button (similar to FF but skips entire scenes). I was able to skip right to the main menu, then to my workout, and I didn't watch a single commercial! Again, don't rate a video based on your inability to use your remote.

Anyway I'm glad I didn't let these reviews deter me!!

Now the good stuff!

I recognized these women right off the bat! They DO have a prenatal yoga DVD too! (if you're interested in doing yoga- I read some reviews that actually thought THIS was the yoga video. It is NOT but there is one). I used their yoga DVD with my first pregnancy. I think they are great! Awesome at instruction, friendly-casual demeanor, and easy to follow!!! NOT smug or obnoxious like many trainers!!!! And it's nice to have an actual pregnant woman working right along with you!

The workout was perfect! I don't have a tension-band so I used my dumbbells. The only thing my dumbbells didn't really work on were the leg-lifts but I just flexed and still felt the burn! I will definitely be sore tomorrow! I love how they constantly remind the viewer to drink water and to breathe! I felt amazing after my workout! There are three parts to all the workouts (as their should be!); The warm-up (which by the way I was SWEATING at the end!), the workout, the cool-down with stretches. All in all I think the Express workout took me about 40 minutes (I'm guessing). The full workout is prob an hour total?

This is a great video and I would recommend it to any mom that needs to get in some workouts at home. I will be using this in conjunction with walking (when the weather is nice) and my prenatal workouts at the gym.

I can see myself using this as a postnatal workout too! Especially when the baby is really little and I can't get out of the house!

Love these two ladies!! Thanks!",1362268800,6,2877,4.360747663551402

Most of the classes and DVDs that I did left me feeling like I didn't get a workout at all. This is the only DVD that I have come across that really challenges me. I feel recharged, stronger, and restored after doing a session. I was actually going to put off doing this DVD until my last trimester and I'm so glad I didn't. I am going to add this to my weekly schedule of workouts. Happy moms=happy babies is so true!

3820987,5,B001VC995S,"It isn't very often that I feel inclined to write a review on a product, but this DVD made such a positive difference in my 2nd pregnancy, I have to weigh in!  Let me preface this by saying that I did not take very good care of myself during my first pregnancy.  I ended up gaining 55 pounds and had a really looooong and difficult labor.  I vowed to do better during my 2nd pregnancy.  This DVD was so much fun and I really felt like it got my heart pumping (went into pregnancy fairly fit and in good shape), it was something that I actually looked forward to doing.  Summer and Kari do a great job of incorporating all parts of the body into this workout, it feels like a very well rounded workout.  I love that this DVD is broken down by trimester and also has the option of choosing between the full length workout and 20 minute express.  The only drawback is that sometimes I felt a little bored because the full length workout just repeated the circuit twice; totally not a deal breaker in my opinion.  My workout routine for my whole pregnancy consisted of a good mix of cardio (walking), yoga (used the Shiva Rea DVD) and this DVD for my strength training (I worked out 5-6 days a week).  I kept this routine up until I reached 37 weeks.  Quite frankly, I give this workout full credit for the way I felt my whole pregnancy.  My body felt so good. . .the squats and labor lunges were amazing for my back and hips; these were great in prepping me for labor.  Plus, I had so much energy this time, a huge benefit when trying to keep up with a preschooler.  So thank you to Summer and Kari for a great workout DVD, thanks to you I gained about 20 pounds less this pregnancy and had worlds easiest labor!",1360108800,2,1709,4.237654320987654
3820988,5,B001VC995S,I bought this dvd as soon as I entered my second trimester and I love it. I love that Summer is also pregnant in the video and she has such a great personality to help get you moving on those days were you want to move but are too lazy. I love how its divided into trimesters and each trimester has a full length and express workouts. I would highly recommend this dvd to pregnant women who want a good yet light workout.,1360108800,,421,4.0843373493975905

3820993,5,B001VC995S,"I purchased this and started it during my second trimester. I skipped ahead at the time out of curiosity to see what third trimester workout was like and thought ""yeah right"" bc some of the moves you are sitting in a chair. However, once I got to that point it is definitely appropriate. You are always working muscles but not pushing it too much. I did this my whole pregnancy and bounced back after about two months with an unelective c section for my first child. I also like the option for express workout on the days you just aren't feeling it. Trust me, this is what you want to purchase out of all the other prenatal workouts. It's difficult enough to work you (you'll sweat) but not so crazy that you won't do it on the days you are exhausted (when..lets face it, can be everyday when you are pregnant.)",1358985600,,811,4.377483443708609

I love that exercise focuses on butt, legs, arms, shoulders, and abs, yes, even abs. I showed my doctor and doctor said perfectlly healthy and recommends. I really think this video will stay in shape, so far my butt is showing for it :P",1358899200,,551,4.690721649484536

Summer challenges you to work all areas of your body, to the level of intensity that you feel comfortable, but doesn't ""over due it"" so that you're sore the next day.  The workouts in this video also allow you to switch up what you want to get out of them.  They are divided up by trimester and it would be nice if there was several workouts to choose from for each trimester!",1358640000,,562,4.3238095238095235
3820996,3,B001VC995S,"I started doing this video around 5th months pregnant,  after not doing much else but the occasional yoga class, so I was not in the best shape. Summer is perky without being annoying and moves at a nice pace, enough for me to feel it but not be super tired afterwards. I was not aware, however, when purchasing that she uses a resistance band quite often throughout the 45-50min. full routine as well as the. 30min express workout. I found myself instead lunging or walking in place or tried substituting with small hand weights.

Also, I skipped the section with the abdominal crunches. I was always instructed not to do them during pregnancy but I'm sure she consulted a physician and was given the ok but i'd rather not chance it. The cool down section has good stretches too.

Overall it's a good video. Just be sure to get a resistance band to reap the full benefits.",1358467200,,873,4.547770700636943
3820997,4,B001VC995S,"I really like this DVD, the workout for the 1st trimester really works your legs and arms which is awesome. The level of intensity is that of a lot of non prenatal workout DVD's. I was very impressed when I put it in my DVD player for the first time. I cannot comment on the 2nd and 3rd trimester exercises as I have not done those yet. You do need a resistance band for the workout.",1358380800,,383,4.052631578947368

3820999,5,B001VC995S,"I will admit that prior to pregnancy I wasn't much into structured workouts - I'm a city dweller so I walk everywhere I go (including flight after flight of stairs), and I dislike gyms. That said I actually look forward to this workout. No joke. I feel great after doing either the express or the full version - though please be aware that the express version is still about a half-hour long including the warm-up and stretch, so plan your time accordingly. Also, not sure this is made clear in the description, but you need a resistance band (thankfully I had a set, but without one specifically for the upper body, you won't get much out of the workout).
Summer and her co-host aren't ridiculously chirpy and irritatingly peppy, and Summer is *clearly* pregnant which in a way motivates me to keep up with her.
Really, I couldn't be happier with this DVD and will likely keep doing a modified version of this workout even after my pregnancy.",1357516800,,943,4.619047619047619

I started this in my second trimester and as someone who is/was in pretty good shape(I ran a marathon a few months before I got pregnant) I found the workout sort of lame. I also got annoyed with the banter and music.
Once I got well in to my third trimester I found I didn't want to do my tougher workouts and gravitated towards this DVD. I just turned down the volume all the way and played my iPod instead and I found it a nice way of getting some strength training in. I wouldn't say it made me sore at all but I felt good doing something over daily walks. I'm due in 2 weeks and I'm still doing the workout a few days a week. I also bought a prenatal vinyasa DVD and long and lean which are more challenging, long and lean being the best quality DVD.

The workouts are enough but not too much. I tried another video where the instructor was bouncing all around and it was uncomfortable and didn't feel right. These moves are smooth and comfortable to do while pregnant. I was very fit before becoming pregnant and continued to jog throughout the first trimester. After a while my bouncing belly just made it too uncomfortable so I switched to this video. I definitely recommend checking this out. Oh, another thing I love, the video has a section for each trimester. Let's face it, things are easier in trimester one than when you have a basketball sized baby in your belly. :)",1356652800,,770,4.885496183206107

I think the effort level is appropriate (I was moderately active pre-pregnancy).  I think Summer is perky without being annoying, I like the personality she brings to the workouts. Now for the bad; the workouts begin with static stretching, as opposed to the current recommendation for dynamic stretching. I also do not care at all for the abs sections, which are completely crunch based. I don't think that is recommended, due to risk of diastasis recti, and frankly it just doesn't feel good now that I have a real bump. I usually improvise with plank-based core exercises during these sections. Otherwise I heartily recommend this DVD.",1356566400,2,775,4.827067669172933

It was especially offensive when she started complaining about her ""chicken wing"" arms (alluding to saggy upper arms) and pointing to her toned triceps. I myself have been in the fitness industry for 13 years and a BIG no - no is displaying a negative body image to clients. Fitness should be empowering. People don't come to you to hear you complain about your imagined flaws, they want to be inspired and empowered.

3821014,5,B001VC995S,"Out of five prenatal workout videos I bought, this is the only one I've used through my entire pregnancy, from first to third trimester. Each trimester has a workout tailored for your body's abilities at that time, and you can choose either the express version or the full-length depending on how energetic you feel.

This system was so much better for me than all my other workout videos! It meant that even when I was feeling blah I could manage the quick version. And when I was feeling full of energy, I could choose the full workout and adjust the flex band to give myself as much challenge as I wanted. The instruction is pretty good, though it probably helps if you have some workout experience so you can get the positioning right, and both women are good at reminding you to drink water and watch your form.

Every trimester includes a warmup, a strength training section with the flex band plus squats and lunges, and a cool down with stretching. The express versions are roughly 30 minutes; the full versions are roughly 45 minutes, with a repeat of the strengthening section.

I'm 33 weeks right now and I do the full version of the 3rd trimester workout with no problem. This video has kept me fit and in great shape. My weight gain is exactly on target. I can go for 40 minute walks, do most of the housework (not without some grunting, but still), and my back and hips feel great, hardly any problem at all. The one drawback I can think of is that Summer's chatty, ditzy banter, while initially cute, gets old when you hear it a few times a week. But I now tune her out pretty well.

Love that each trimester workout is different, but all are challenging (especially the first trimester!). The first trimester workout is chalked full of squats and made my legs so much stronger than before I was pregnant. This workout got me in shape for a 4 day / 30 mile hiking trip in Colorado when I was 16 weeks pregnant. I had issues very early on with sciatica and by regularly doing this workout and A LOT of stretching, I was able to get minimize the effects. The second trimester workout continues to be challenging, but the 3rd trimester eases up quite a bit which was a relief as my growing belly started zapping my energy.

I use this DVD 2-3 times a week to supplement other forms of exercise (walking, stretching, yoga) and I have really enjoyed the ongoing commentary from Summer and Keri and have even found myself laughing and talking back to them during the session. I am almost always a bit stiff the next day - in a good way, particularly in the thighs, and have found that the variety of having 3 different workouts - one for each trimester as well as full length and express options, has kept things fresh enough for me to not get bored. Make sure you purchase a stretchy band to use for the workouts. I use a rubber Theraband which has been great. Highly recommend this DVD.",1353024000,,895,4.530864197530864
3821019,3,B001VC995S,"Good enough, but less than expected. One of very few similar dvds that have different workouts for each trimester, but the workout itsself was not good enough, because we were interested more in aerobic exercises.",1352851200,,213,5.114285714285714
3821020,4,B001VC995S,"I received my three workout videos last week: ""10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates"" with Lizbeth Garcia, ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1"" with Karyne Steben, and ""Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout."" So far I have only used 10 Minute Solution twice, and the other two only once. I would like to update as I continue to use these videos but I wanted to give my thoughts so far.

10 Minute Solution has five 10-minute workouts. I am a total newbie on pilates but I loved this video. I only made it through two workouts on my first try; on my second try I got through all five. In the future I will only use the first four, and instead of the flexibility one I will do my own stretches, just because it didn't seem to go as well with my joint pain as my own stretches do.

Perfect Pregnancy vol. 1 is about 40 minutes long. Karyne gives alternate moves for intermediate and advanced, but I had to stick with the beginner moves, and it kicked my butt. Twice I even had to stop and rest because I could not keep up with her. That woman is amazingly strong. I really liked that she included a lot of ab work, because I feel like my abs need that desperately.

Summer Sanders' workout was much milder, but it was still a good workout. She does a little bit of abs, but mostly focuses on arms and legs. The workout is about 45-50 minutes long. I didn't realize that you need a resistance band. I have one, but mine is a loop and on the video she uses a straight band with handles at each end. I was able to do the leg exercises, just holding my band lower, but for the arm exercises I used a pair of 3 lb weights instead, and that worked fine. I gave this one four stars instead of five because I felt like I needed more of a workout than this video gives.

I just wanted to say how amazed I was with the difference I felt in my own body after only one week of working out with these videos. I am 33 years old and 21 weeks along in my 5th pregnancy. I am six feet tall, so my ideal weight is between 150-160 lbs. I have sacroiliac joint dysfunction, which started in my first pregnancy, which just means that I get a lot of joint pain in the back of my right hip. This joint pain got worse with each pregnancy, until in my 3rd pregnancy I was sometimes unable to walk from one room to the next without pain. I have found that regular chiropractic appointments have helped a ton, and I walked regularly through my 4th pregnancy and that seemed to help too. But I have also noticed that my abs seem really weak, like they can't handle carrying another baby and I have felt like I really need a good ab workout.

After my first pregnancy, I got down to 145 lbs. Woo-hoo!
After my 2nd pregnancy, I stopped losing at around 155. After my 3rd it was 165, and after my 4th I never got lower than 173. So I have also been extremely concerned with this trend. I have gained too much weight during all of my pregnancies, and so far in this one I have already gained about as much as I think I should have gained for my whole pregnancy (currently 196). So I hope that regular exercise will help me gain slower, as well as help my joint pain.

After only one week of working out with these videos, I have already felt a huge improvement! For the first time in weeks I didn't gain a pound this week #yay!#, and although I imagine I look exactly the same, I feel better, my muscles feel tighter all over, and I feel like I look better. My joint pain is very minimal, and most of the time I don't feel any pain at all there. I am blown away with how much the joint pain has improved with just one week of working out. And my tummy feels tighter, like maybe it can handle this baby after all! I feel healthier in every way. I am really excited about such amazing results in so little time.",1352678400,,3770,4.157534246575342

3821024,4,B001VC995S,I really like this pre-natal work out. It isn't too much but just enough to make me sweat and feel better during the day. It has 1st 2nd and 3rd trimester sections so that is helpful as well. The only thing I don't like is that they keep going back and forth from the tension band to exercises with out the tension band. So you are constantly re-adjusting the band and picking it back up. This makes it seem slow for part of the work out. Overall though I really like the video!,1350259200,2,478,4.150537634408602
3821025,5,B001VC995S,"Before I was pregnant I was a serious (very NON olympian) runner.  25 weeks into my pregnancy, I simply can't run anymore without discomfort, and hopping around (think, Jillian's 30 day sculpt) isn't working for my giant growing belly anymore, either.  I'm deep water running as much as possible and was looking for something else to do on the other days to keep fit.  This video is perfect for that.  The bands allow you to make the strength exercises as difficult as you want so I always end up worn out at the end of it.  What I especially like about the video is that it's actually helped me with my body image.  I know I'm getting more huge by the minute and all my old workouts are getting untenable, and you know what, it's okay.  This workout doesn't include burpies, sprints or what have you, but it DOES make me sore and is bringing back the accent lines to my arms, shoulders and butt, and that's exactly what I want right now.  Pregnancy fitness is a bridge to what comes after it (recovery).  To those who say they don't even work up a sweat, I recommend shortening your band; there is no way that 40 tough biceps curls alternated with band-restricted squats shouldn't make you work up a sweat.",1348185600,3,1207,4.45

The length of workouts are great - I love that the full length workout is still only about 55 minutes from start to finish and there's always the express option for days I'm not feeling up to the whole thing. I bought this DVD while I was in my 2nd trimester, so I skipped the 1st trimester workout all together, but I love that it's broken up by trimester and seems to be very well catered to energy level, belly size, etc. It is a repetitive program - with several reps of each exercise in a set and then repeats of the entire set, but it moves quickly enough through it that I find the exercise changes just about the time I'm getting tired of doing it. I like that I break a little sweat but don't feel I'm overdoing it. I feel a little muscle soreness afterwards, which is welcome since I sometimes feel like such a lazy couch potato! And Summer Sanders is really motivating - I would recommend this to any mama to be - it's great.",1347494400,,1100,4.293269230769231

I am not an active person, but these workouts were perfect for me.  Also the banter between Summer and her sister in law is not as bad as some workout videos I've seen.  But after a few repeat viewings, you can always mute them and put on your own music.

I would highly recommend for anyone looking to stay in shape while pregnant, and I think these workouts will be useful, even after baby is born!",1346284800,,516,4.171717171717172
3821028,1,B001VC995S,They talk too much. Pretty much just a repetition of a few exercises. Not good for moms who used to workvout before. Will not even sweat a bit.,1346025600,2,143,4.142857142857143
3821029,3,B001VC995S,"So far I have only done the first trimester workout, as I am 8 weeks along.  The use of resistance bands, push-ups, lunges, and plies make for a great workout for upper and lower body, especially shoulders, triceps, and glutes.  I actually have less ""turkey flab"" on my underarms then before I became pregnant, mostly due to the push-ups demonstrated with correct form.  Lots of good shoulder work too.

But....the ab work is dangerous and should not be followed, even in the first trimester- especially for those of us on second or later pregnancies like myself.  They use tons of crunches, and even doing them on pillows is problematic.  And the fact that they do any crunches at all, modified or not, in the second trimester scares me (can you say ""diastasis recti?"").

I kept tweaking my lower back out and it only happened when I did the ab workout in this video.  Here's why: your ligaments and joints loosen up substantially, and it can happen earlier in the pregnancy if you've already been pregnant before.  You just don't have the back support to be doing crunches when your body is in that state.  At least not at the intensity and amount that they do them in this video.  For PROPER core exercises I would suggest Lindsay Brin's videos.  She really knows proper form for pregnant bodies when it comes to exercise.  Lindsay does crunches in the first trimester only but only about 12 of them and one of her exercise mates shows modifications using an exercise ball which is much safer if your ligaments have relaxed this early on.

Also, in the warmup, they go into static stretching (which should really only be done after a workout) without doing enough dynamic warmup exercises first.

So, I still do this workout because of the awesome upper body benefits and to mix it up, but I skip the ab section entirely.  You really have to be careful with your abs during pregnancy.

And...one other note:  it wasn't very considerate of them to do neck rolls as a stretching exercise for first trimester women- a lot of us are suffering from morning/all day sickness and the last thing we want to do is roll our heads from side to side (if we don't want to vomit that is).",1345075200,13,2177,4.595854922279793

I purchased Summer Sanders prenatal workout and Karen Steiben's perfect pregnancy workout so that I was able to workout at home when it was too hot outside for walking. Summer's video was okay. It is pretty slow and Summer and her trainer's voices are really annoying. The background music is also very annoying. I don't really break a sweat or feel like I worked out when I am finished. The workouts are by trimesters and by the time you get to the third trimester they barely have you move. I should also mention that you need a resistance band for all of the workouts. Karen's Perfect pregnancy video is way better. I feel tired and not sore when I am finished and it is quick and straight to the point.

Of the three, I feel like this is the best workout, with the Susan Bowen in second and the yoga as more relaxing and good for days when you just need a stretch.  Summer Sanders and her trainer/sister-in-law do the workout together with Summer 7 months pregnant.  They do a good job of reminding you to drink water, breathe, and not over-do it, and the trainer is very encouraging.  There are separate workouts for each trimester. I'm into the second trimester now, and there is lots of focus on squats & working out the arms, but it's an all around good workout that leaves you feeling energized with your muscles tired.  The first trimester workout actually left me sore a few times.  I am not super fit, but I walk a few miles 3x/week  with my dogs and try to at least do some wii fit a few times a week as well.  While this workout is not killer, it's definitely a good way to keep fit safely while pregnant.  I think it's a good choice for both people who don't exercise a lot and want to get moving while they are pregnant and for those who exercise a lot and have to tone it down for pregnancy because it's just challenging enough that you feel accomplished but won't push you too hard.  Like Summer says in the workout, this isn't about losing weight or getting 6 pack abs.  It's about being a healthy mommy.  I've found that exercising in the morning really gives me more energy during the day, especially if I wake up tired.
Note:  you need an exercise band with handles to get the best out of the workout - it says so on the back of the case, but I didn't see it at first.

When I found out I was pregnant, I thought I was going to lose all my muscles. So far, I have kept up with doing this tape about 3 times a week, and I've only lost 4 pounds in my first 3 months, which has all been muscle loss. The video is broken down into each trimester and you get to choose which to do. I seem to get through the warmup and am already sweating. The workout makes my body sore for days and I love it. The video uses a resistance band, so of course if you are a beginner you can pick a medium resistance band. Depending on your level, you can make this video a challenge for you with the resistance band.

Now for the not so good, the first time I watched it I thought Summer was pretty annoying. However, now that I know the moves I tend to listen less to the TV and don't pay attention as much so I don't notice her. I like Kerri, and looking at her is a great motivator!

I've read many reviews for days to decide on which video to purchase, and I am thoroughly happy with my decision on this video.

However, because Summer has so many quips during the work out, it has so little replay value. Yes, I feel great after these workouts, but I can't even listen to it anymore. Its seems like a cardinal rule of exercise DVDs not to make conversation or jokes so much. Its like an annoying time marker. ""Oh, Summer jokes about chicken arms. *sigh* I have another 20 minutes to go.""

Also, they transition through the exercises so quickly that I often have to pause to get my equipment ready. Sure, if I had a trainer standing right (often so close, it invades personal boundaries. Good thing they are sister-in-laws.) to hold my water, my resistance band or set up my pillows, I could move through a lot quickly too. But, I don't. Only my husband who occasionally hands me water and says, ""I can't listen to her anymore, I'll be in the other room.""

Overall, I only use the arm workouts and use another workout DVD for a more full work out. Decent, at best.",1337731200,,1089,4.608247422680412
3821056,5,B001VC995S,"am finally getting around to write the review of the second trimester workouts from Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout DVD, I unfortunately didn't start using her workout DVD until I was already in my second trimester so I am not going to do a first trimester workout review (since I didn't do any).

I purchased this DVD along with two other prenatal dvd's when I was around 10 weeks pregnant.  I knew that since we had canceled our gym membership, got rid of our faulty elliptical and my running had become non-existent that I was going to need  some workout videos to help me stay active during my pregnancy. Out of the three videos this has been my favorite and the most used, although since the weather has been nicer out I have been using it less and trying to get outside for walks with my husband more but I am still loving the workouts.

Summer Sanders, an Olympic gold medalist, and her personal trainer, Keri Crockett (also her sister-in-law) lead you through the workouts. I love the Summer is actually pregnant in the videos, it gives me more motivation to keep pushing through the workout because if she can do it so can I! The DVD features both a full length and express workout and to be honest I have only done the full length workout once, I usually do the express workout which is about 35 minutes in length.  I find that it is the perfect amount of time for me and I usually end up going for a walk with the husband as well so I get two workouts in.

The workouts feature a lot of strength training and toning for the whole body including a nice balance of legs, arms and pregnancy friendly ab workouts. I always finish my workouts feeling energized and so glad I did it.  Summer and Keri really are great to watch and listen to as well, they are informative, motivating and entertaining.

I will say that the one downfall of this video is that it is mostly a strength workout, there is very little cardio.  Since I don't do any other strength specific workouts and I find time to get light cardio in on other days it has been fine for me but I know that for others that has been one con regarding the workouts.  I loved  the second trimester workouts and I am looking forward to trying out the third trimester workouts and seeing how they different from the second trimester.",1336694400,2,2294,4.425178147268409

3821058,5,B001VC995S,I love this DVD I got it when I was in the end of my second trimester and started using it and it is a good work out.  The next day I was sore( which I like because that means I was actually doing something) and I was worried that the pregnancy work outs would me to easy.  I would recommend this to any pregnant woman who want to try to stay in shape during pregnancy.,1336348800,,369,3.8421052631578947

It's a decent workout...not too overly stimulating but certainly better than not doing anything. I'd say my biggest complaint is that while it's great that Summer has a trainer with her to assist her..I do not. So I find that while her trainer is setting up her pillows for her next exercise, or getting her water all while Summer's working out, I keep having to pause the dvd in order to do those things myself. Not a huge deal, but certainly something that has annoyed me enough to mention.",1335571200,,631,4.495652173913044

3821061,5,B001VC995S,I absolutely love this dvd! This is my first pregnancy and I'm two weeks away from ending my first trimester. Since I had been working out before I got pregnant I was looking for a video that would make me feel like I still put in a good workout but at the same time was compliant with what the doctor and pregnancy books say when it comes to physical fitness. Summer's dvd does just that. I love how it's broken up into sections and you can choose from a longer or shorter workout.  Summer and Keri make the perfect team and they are very encouraging!,1335225600,,552,4.257142857142857

And now that I'm expecting baby #2, I realize that summer is coming up and I'd like to be able to feel good about my pregnant body. :)  Enter this DVD.

It focuses on all 3 trimesters, and caters to a pregnant mom's changing body and abilities for each trimester.  The dialogue between Summer and her sister-in-law is easy, casual, and natural.  You feel like you're with your own sisters.  Never annoying, as some workout DVDs can be.

You get a great, doable, productive workout, whether you choose express or full mode.  You will feel results SOON!

The only equipment you need is a resistance band and some floor pillows.

This is a fun workout, even for those of us who profess to hate exercise.  You'll feel better, especially once you've done the workouts for a few weeks.  You'll notice a difference in your energy, less back pain, and a better self image.

Highly recommend!",1328745600,4,1024,4.574585635359116
3821073,3,B001VC995S,"I chose this video based on the high reviews and recommendations it received, and based on it being associated with an olympic athlete, but I was disappointed.  I do think it is a great idea to organize workouts are according to trimester and time available to work out; however, the quality of instruction and the video in general disappointed me.  The work out style and atmosphere reminded me of an 80's workout -- a little out dated in terms of the types of activities, the music, and the atmosphere.  I found it a little boring and not very challenging.  It felt like a ""been there done that"" workout.  Considering it is associated with an olympic athlete, I was expecting a more challenging and instructional workout.  I ordered two other videos at the same time that I am very happy with and highly recommend: Jennifer Wolfe's ""prenatal vinyasa yoga and short forms"" workout and Karyne Steben's ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" volume 1.  Summer Sander's workout is good if you want a mild workout and you enjoy an 80's style fitness program.",1328659200,6,1048,4.788888888888889
3821074,5,B001VC995S,"This is actually a really great set of workouts tailored to each trimester, but not so much yoga as it is a workout video, in my opinion! There is an option for a quick workout or a full workout and it is nice to be able to pick which one depending on the time you have. I always feel like I am actually working out instead of just moving or stretching. Just a heads up though, the workouts sometimes require an exercise band (I didn't realize this the first time) so you will need one to get the full benefit. I did find Summer to be a bit distracting, dare I say obnoxious, as  she talks over the instructor quite a bit in attempts to be funny but nothing intoralable.

I wish they did more stretching excersizes and described movements/ target areas better during the workout to keep you thinking about the excersizes and not running through the motions. The constant banter is also a little annoying.  I only do the workout when my husband is out b/c it drives him nuts.

You need resistance bands. Not sure if this is made clear when you purchase this. This workout is challenging and is pretty much full body. My only complaints are that it is repetitive. You go through the exercises once, and then they just have you do the whole thing over again instead of doing a 2nd round focusing on the same body parts but with different exercises. And then the leg exercises are the same rotation of squats over and over again.",1328313600,,504,4.6

There is a full workout (53 minutes) and express workout (about 30 minutes) depending on how much time you have.

It is a great DVD... I love all the squats! Squats are awesome for keeping muscle tone throughout pregnancy. I was disappointed when I went onto the 3rd trimester workout though... it's really easy and that's too bad b/c I've been doing the 2nd tri workout forever and was looking forward to a change. I'll probably just keep doing the 2nd tri workout til I can't anymore... maybe like 36+ weeks I'm thinking. My belly is also a lot smaller than Summer's 2nd tri belly so maybe that's why I'm feeling like the 3rd tri is too easy... I'm still really mobile and rather small for 3rd tri.

This is the ONLY one I used and I did it nearly everyday once I got it at the end of my first trimester.  It is separated into trimesters with both shorter and longer workouts for each trimester.  You only need an exercise band to do this, but yet I felt like it was just the right amount of exercise, combined with walking or light jogging to stay fit and healthy throughout my pregnancy.  I was able to gain a healthy amount of weight and after delivery the weight came off very quickly, in part I feel because I stayed fit and active while pregnant.  I also feel it was very helpful to be fit when I delivered our daughter.

This video, however, is a welcome challenge!  It gets you up, gets your heart rate going, and includes good strength exercises.  The workout is modified for each trimester, and for each trimester, you can choose the express workout or regular length.  Make sure you have exercise bands before you start the video.

3821085,5,B001VC995S,"My husband bought me this DVD for Christmas (at my request). I have several prenatal fitness DVDs, and I like this one the most by far. Let me preface this with a few things:

1) I am an active person already. I like to go for runs, do yoga, hike, etc. So I like feeling like I am doing *something*
2) I am 16 weeks along, and already over the throes of first trimester morning sickness, so I don't know what doing the 1st trimester work out would be like if you feel like poo.
3) I am relatively fit, and already understand correct body posture for weight training/band exercise.

So, this DVD starts with a nice little stretch routine, then a bit of cardio to get warmed up (nothing to crazy, but will get you breathing a bit harder), and then does most work with lunges and an elastic band. You cover butt, legs, biceps and triceps. There is an 'abs' section at the end, but the way they have you doing it isn't really 'abs', it is more like gentle core work. One shouldn't really work one's abs when you are pregnant, and as long as you have the pillows and such like they do, it is really more core/stabilizing muscles being worked.

I have to admit, I really like it. It is long enough (and there is a quick version) for you to feel like you did something, and the cool down stretching at the end feels great. I think if you wanted to give yourself more or less depending on the position of the band, that is totally fine. I went for form, and that did the trick. Burn in the butt, burn in the legs and arms.

Summer and the instructor, Keri (her sister-in-law) are a bit chatty, and I have noticed some reviews on here saying that it is irritating, but anyone who has EVER done an at home DVD workout (like P90x or Insanity for example) this is nothing. I mean, Tony with P90x is way more chatty and corny. So, not bad and well worth the $. Totally recommend.",1325462400,,1866,4.218487394957983
3821086,3,B001VC995S,"I thought this video would be a little more challenging.  I'm not looking to lose weight, but did want to feel as if I worked my muscles a bit.

I notice some definite toning in my legs, rear, and arms. I find Summer and Kerri to be cheerful and motivating. I like that Summer is very pregnant in this dvd because I feel like if she can do it, so can I.

3821090,2,B001VC995S,"If you are already a fan of Summer Sanders, you may like this video, but I found her comments and jokes to be more annoying than funny.  The video includes a workout leader who is not pregnant, telling Summer what to do and handing her water.  The exercises are basically the same sculpting moves you would have in any regular workout video.  It goes upper, lower, upper, lower, etc. with about 5 specific exercises that are repeated again just spaced out.  The only move that seemed geared specifically for helping with labor was the ""labor lunge,"" which caused my knee to buckle.  I have knee issues so that was painful and made me want to quit the video right halfway through.  I did the second trimester workout and I do feel it in my arms and glutes, but I didn't break a sweat and did not get any cardio out of it.  Also I didn't realize I would need resistance bands for most of the workout.

I thought this video would be good because it has workouts for all three trimesters, but I don't even want to try the other workouts now.  Instead of this DVD, I would recommend the Perfect Pregnancy workout, vol. 1, with Karyne Steben.  I have been doing that workout weekly since 10 weeks and I am 24 Weeks now. It still hasn't gotten boring and I feel great afterwards. It includes beginner, intermediate, and advanced options throughout the same video, so you can choose what's right for you no matter what trimester you're in.

Sometimes she makes comments about the birth and how it will feel like a 20 pound baby instead of a 6 pound baby.  What?!?  I don't need to hear that. A little compassion please for the first timers. I'm excited for the moment when I don't have to listen to there instructions/comments and can just turn the music on while I'm working out.

If I do this video again, I will mute the volume and put some decent music on so I don't have to hear Summer.
I am so disappointed I bought this. It gets 2 starts because it is a decent workout.  It is really long and drawn out, especially the long versions...I would definitely recommend only doing the express workouts.  Even with those, I found myself waiting around and sighing.

3821096,5,B001VC995S,I really enjoy this workout video.  The exercises are catered to the different trimesters and the exercises themselves really do give you a workout.

I love that it covers the three trimesters and each tri has both a full-length and an express option. The workout just flies by because it doesn't miss a beat and keeps you moving. Some people have commented that there isn't any cardio, but I think if you work on getting your heartrate up in the beginning, you get the amount of cardio you need during pregnancy. (Summer herself comments that this workout isn't about burning calories or losing weight.) I also love that it only requires the resistance band and some pillows -- bargain!

I understand why some people find Summer annoying, but I actually think she's adorable and makes the workout more fun. She and Keri make you feel like you're working out with your friends, and the fact that Summer is 7 months along and so energetic gives me a lot of hope for my third trimester!",1321747200,,954,4.514450867052023

The only regret I have is that I wish I had gotten it sooner in my pregnancy.  I love the second trimester workout. I had no idea you could do abs while pregnant! I didn't realize how much control you can have over your own belly until I watched it.  I was actually surprised that the workouts weren't too easy and I felt great afterwards. I then moved on to the third trimester workout and found that it was actually harder than the second! (Maybe it's just me)...For those who are in better shape, you have the control over your own workout. You can dip lower in your squats or create more resistance with your band to get a better burn. Or you can pause and do another set. I find that walking in the morning for 30-45 minutes BEFORE the video is perfect. Also, Summer reminds you very often to drink water and support the belly. As many times as I've watched it, I'm glad she repeats these things because it's very helpful when my muscles are burning and I'm concentrating on breathing and proper form that I forget all about water (even though the water bottle is right beside me!!!)",1321056000,,1217,4.380530973451328

The workout was designed by Keri and endorsed by doctors as being safe for pregnancy.  I love the option for different workouts in each trimester.  It does require an exercise band, which luckily I already had at home.  I feel like I can do it over and over and not get bored.  The workout is laid out as follows:

I like that the DVD is broken down into three different workouts for the three trimesters.  Even though I've moved into the beginning of my third trimester I'm still doing the second trimester workout on days when I have a lot of energy.  The DVD suggests you have bands for some of the moves, but I didn't have those.  I used light 3 lb weights instead and though it was a great substitution.

3821123,4,B001VC995S,"I found this DVD great as it focused on muscle tone maintenance as well as low impact cardio.  There are work outs for all 3 trimesters which was great as it did cater for the changes in your body (and energy) over this time.

I didn't realise you needed a ""fitness band"" for the work outs - this didn't come with the video so was a little annoying - personally, it ended up not being a huge deal for me as I had free weights which I used instead that allowed me to choose my own level of resistance (so probably suited me better anyway).

The instructors get a little annoying when you have used the video many times, but it wasn't a deal breaker for me.

There is also full length and express work- outs - basically the full length one doubled the 'work out' session, it was good for the days you had less time (or energy) to spend.

I also enjoyed the mixture of upper and lower body work outs.  I found there was a great balance of the two.

Overall, a great work out which I used consistently in my second and third trimesters (felt too ill in my first!) and kept me feeling fitter and healthier throughout my pregnancy.  Highly recommended.",1309478400,,1146,4.273148148148148

Highly recommend this DVD if you are looking for something that will get your heart pumping and tone your body. This is my second pregnancy and I wish I had known about it with my first. I also like Summer Sanders personality on the DVD...she is fun and gets you motivated. Her sister in law is great, too.

I would caution that I don't feel this video would be for someone who was not very active prior to pregnancy or just starting an exercise routine for their pregnancy. That being said, I would recommend this for active woman who want to maintain a good workout.

This video is broken down by trimesters and there is a different routine for each trimester. The only downside is it's just 1 routine for 3 months. But, I mix it in with days of walking and water aerobics. You also have the option of doing the full length workout or the express workout. I like that feature because some days there isn't enough time (or energy) to do the whole thing. I feel there's a good mix of cardio and toning. They even add in ab work for the first 2 trimesters.

The only equipment you will need is an exercise band, some pillows, and a chair for the 3rd trimester. The other great thing about this video is that Summer and her workout partner are not obnoxious about leading. They add in a joke here or there and it's just a very natural/casual workout.

The movements were sharp and instruction was very poor and uninteresting. It felt like one of those skits from Saturday Night Live, where the women are talking on the radio with very bland voices and tones, but not funny at all. I would definately not recommend this for prenatal workout. Perfect Pregnancy Workouts were my absolute favorite!",1302134400,3,507,4.906976744186046

I liked how they have 3 workouts, one for each trimester.  By the end of each trimester, I was ready to move on to another workout, but the workouts within each trimester stayed fun and motivating.  At first I didn't think they were hard, but now that I'm 6 months pregnant, I'm finding that the workouts are really perfect!  I would highly recommend this video.",1302048000,,531,4.3979591836734695

I have been working out regularly for over a year and am only six weeks along and this video was pretty much a waste of money for me. There is no cardio and in the beginning you don't even get a decent warmup before they start having you stretch. Summer Sanders is super annoying and is basically like ""look at me trainer"" when the trainer is trying to show modifications of the exercise. I will keep this in my rotation for a variation on toning exercises, but I need a video that is cardio and toning in one. I don't have time to work out for hours a day. I recommend Erin O' Brien's Prenatal Fitness Fix for more advanced exercisers.",1301097600,15,693,4.257575757575758
3821145,5,B001VC995S,"I love this video!

In fairness, I've only done the full 2nd Trimester workout and am 28 weeks pregnant. Summer and her trainer/sister in law are very clear in giving instructions and helpful tips. They really help you do the exercises correctly and you have enough repetitions to correct yourself! They count down the exercises, and explain what is coming next, so you're prepared for a change in movement. Much of the routine is strength training exercises with a resistance band with a lot of breathing to make it aerobic. I feel really good with the pace- I feel like I'm working hard, but there are lots of breaks with gentle lunges and opportunities to grab some water! The workout begins with a warmup, has two cycles of strength/cardio, and ends with a cool down/stretch.

Pros:
-easy to follow- even my first time
-really feels like a workout- even the next day
-great breathing and stretching exercises that relieve tension and sore muscles
-has a workout for each trimester, with a shorter version for each
-upbeat and encouraging

Cons:
-Just rhythmic  background music, so if you like to groove to specific music or sing along, this isn't for you
-Summer is a little chatty and I could see it getting a little old once you've memorized the script- but I think you could follow even with volume way down.
-the long version repeats the same strength exercises- it's not the same video feed played again- but if you want totally different exercises, you're not going to get it

I also love the goals Summer shares in encouragement: healthy mommies, healthy babies, growing bellies!",1300838400,,1591,4.813186813186813

It is not to intense, but makes you feel stronger. I only did the third trimester for a little bit. I didn't feel like it was as good of a workout as the second. I would sometimes go back to the second one for the arm portion. Just a heads up, you need an excercise band for this video. Do not try to do it till you get one. The only thing I really would have a negative comment about is the talking. It gets old watching it day after day and listening to the same comments that Summer makes. I found myself turning the volume way down so I wouldn't have to listen to it. Other than that is it a great video.

But I ordered this video, and liked that there is an express workout for each section, and a full workout. I began for two weeks with the express to loosen my muscles and get used to it, then started the full work out. It's so great! I'm so thankful I found this!! I feel so revived and energetic and sexy now!! I'm building and strengthening lean muscle, learning breathing exercises, and being active for baby!

I like that Summer is 7 months pregnant and does all three workouts, so if you already worked out before your pregnancy, you can feel safe doing the 1st trimester workout in your 2nd or 3rd trimester. It's somewhat challenging without completely wearing you out. My only complaint is that they repeat the workout halfway through.

I feel that the pace is just right for me and I really like using a resistance band. I also like how the video is separated into the different trimesters. Before I got pregnant I would work out about 3 days a week doing weights and mostly walking/jogging. I wasn't an avid workout buff so this may or may not be challenging enough for some people. For me it's perfect and I'm even sore the next day. The only downside is that the ""full workout"" is nothing more than repeating what you did in the express workout. I was hoping it was a little different. Overall, great workout though.",1298332800,,708,4.371212121212121

Reaches the spots (arms, inner thighs, hips, glutes) that tend to get a bit ""untoned""  (that's putting it mildly) during pregnancy. It's been a great addition to my prenatal yoga and running routine which can get a bit boring.  This workout is gentle on your back and knees, safe for your little buddy, and will get your heart rate up. I actually plan to continue the upper body exercises when I'm finally able to get back to rock climbing. Easy to follow and learn routine!

Some might find Summer's banter annoying, but I find it to be a good distraction when I'm feeling the  burn and still have 10 reps to go.",1298160000,,670,4.467213114754099

I have never actually done the full length one because I just don't have time these days to work out that long... but even after the 35 min one, I feel like I have gotten a good workout... and it isn't so short that I don't feel like I've gotten anything done.

I was worried when I became pregnant that I would lose the muscle and tone that I had worked so hard for. I read the reviews on this work out before buying it and was NOT disappointed! I like that it is sectioned into 3 different work outs according to your trimester and you also have the option of the full or express version. Summer and her trainer (also sister-in-law) make it fun and easy to follow along. I definitely feel like I get a good work out in and have maintained most of my muscle tone.

3821161,5,B001VC995S,"I absolutely love this video!  I love that it's broken into three separate trimester workouts so once you're starting to get bored with the first trimester workout, you're ready to move on!  And what a great idea to have a shorter version of each one in case you're short on time.  I have a yoga DVD (Bethenny Frankel's Skinny Girl Yoga workout) as well that I do and then do the shorter version of Summer's DVD, just to mix things up.  I also do some speed walking outside or on the treadmill a couple days a week to get some extra cardio in, but this is an excellent all around workout.  And I love Summer and Keri.  I didn't think they were cheesy at all.  And Summer's growing belly was real motivation!  Also, I do not have the band that they use - I use 5 lb. hand weights and I think they work just fine.  My arms are burning by the end!  I would love for Summer and Keri to make a post-natal video to help shed the pounds after the baby is born!",1296604800,,953,4.102702702702703

Would have liked a little more of a cool down in then end, with more stretching, but it wouldn't prevent me from buying the video.  And the length of time was perfect, a little more than a half hour, but not quite the full hour.  If they expanded the cool down, the video would have run really close to an hour.  I definitely recommend this to pregnant women who have enough energy in the 2nd trimester to tackle a good workout!",1295222400,,610,4.269565217391304
3821164,5,B001VC995S,"This video is great and gives you a real workout. Each trimester workout begins with a pretty hard warm-up, then goes onto the real workout, then repeats the workout so you get a full 45 min including a good cool-down. It's intense but really helps my stiff hips. I wish I had done this during my first pregnancy. Thanks to this and walking 3x/week I've only gained 25lbs so far and I'm 31 weeks. The only tools you need to do the workouts are a chair, up to 4 pillows, yoga mat if you have a hard floor, and a resistance cord. A rubber resistance cord will work best in the last trimester since you have to wrap it around your hands for the shoulder workouts. The woven kind burned my skin a little when I tried it so I switched.
This really is a great workout and you can start it no matter where you are in your pregnancy. If you get annoyed with the ladies you can just hit mute and use your own music. They aren't that bad though.",1295136000,,935,4.142857142857143

I bought this video to have a strength workout that was definitely okay for pregnant women. This workout is interesting (I like Sanders and the coach), but I don't think fit women will find it very challenging (and not a cardio workout). I use it for strength and toning only and use weights even when they are not to make it more worthwhile for me. I'm 19 weeks pregnant so maybe in a few months it will be challenging as is, but for now I'm just using modifications with it. I still like it, but just know you may have to modify depending on your fitness level.",1294704000,,660,4.28

I am now in my 7th month, and while Keri provides the training, Summer knows just what to say to help you get into the poses and positions.  I felt like she was reading my mind when I was thinking ""wait, this is gonna take a while to lay down"" or ""i am moving a little slow, hold on.""  It is not fast paced like a regular workout video, they understand that you will be moving slower, yet they encourage you to really work your muscles, and get results.  While it didn't leave me exhausted (nothing should while you are this far along), it left me feeling like a got a good workout.  I am still faithfully going to the gym on a regular basis, but I will definitely keep using this video as a supplement, and when I can't get out.  Overall very impressed with the quality!

There is a menu to go directly to your type of exercise-so I went directly to the 2nd trimester and started working out.
Make sure to buy a exercise band and set up your pillows to do exercises while on your back or you may have to stop disc to buy the band or set up the pillows.
Otherwise it was great and the team is fun to watch especially the pregnant gal- she is really relatable.

I exercised 6 days a week, alternating days of cardio and strength training and lots of Jillian Michaels circuit training videos.  I was used to a sweat.  I was pleasantly surprised with the challenge the first trimester video provided (if you do the whole thing, you do about 80 push-ups! And somewhere around 150 crunches - if you do the ""Express"" version, cut those numbers in half).  However, due to morning sickness I only did the 1st trimester workout a few times.  I'm 23 weeks pregnant now and have been doing the 2nd trimester segment regularly (3x/week) and it feels good. I wasn't able to get used to the resistance bands so I went back to using 5 lb dumbbells like I was before pregnancy and they seem to be just right for me. Lots of bicep, tricep and leg work. I'm not sure why other reviewers are having an issue with the ads but I am always able to just hit my menu button to go right to the DVD menu and skip all ads.

This video is broken up into 6 parts- a express and full workout for 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimesters. I've been doing the 1st or 2nd trimester workout; the 3rd trimester workout is much too easy; you mainly sit on a chair or just do squats. But the workouts that I do give a pretty nice full body workout- lunges, crunches, stretches, and a lot of arm work. (that is why I like mixing it up with pilates- that video does less arms and more abs/buns/thighs).

I do agree with some other reviewers, prenatal workout DVD's may NOT feel like the workout videos you did before you were pregnant as they aren't as challenging. But just wait- each week it seems to get a little harder for me; I think it is because third trimester the baby grows so much;  not only am I having to carry an extra weight around, but my heart is having to pump so much harder to get adequate blood flow & oxygen to her. So it isn't healthy to push myself like I did when I wssn't pregnant. I like how Summer reminds us ladies in this DVD- working out during pregnancy is NOT about losing weight- it is about a ""growing belly, healthy mommy & healthy baby"". Remember this ladies- we want to be healthy first and foremost, and it may mean taking the workout down a notch. I heard that during 3rd trimester, even taking a walk is like climbing a mountain in regards to how hard your body is having to work!!!",1291852800,,1567,4.308474576271187

I never did the first trimester workout since I got this during my second, but the second and third trimester workouts are truly workouts!

The switch from Jillian Michaels to Summer and Keri was almost more than I could handle because it was so drastic, but that is to be expected. Then one day I had to find something new. I have to say, I'm not really sweating when I'm done, nor do I ever need to ""really stop"" like I did when I was working out before. They have it figured with what is best for you for pregnancy, like bicep curls, long stretches and labor lunges. They use four pillows and a resistance band throughout, but I've been able to modify the moves to use my hand weights instead of the band. Summer is funny throughout, sometimes a little annoying, but it works. So would I really call this a *workout* DVD? No. But good to get the blood flowing and help with areas you will need during delivery and to hold the baby after. So that is good; I'll keep doing this mostly because of the other stellar reviews.",1288656000,,1235,4.913875598086125
3821185,4,B001VC995S,This DVD is really good for home use or if you travel!!  I really like that there are different workouts for each trimester because your capabilities change during different stages of pregnancy.  Summer and her sister in law (the trainer) are fun to watch and the excercises are fun and work a lot of different muscle groups.  It also has a longer video 60 min and an express video 30 min.,1288483200,,389,4.450704225352113

She made the DVD with her sister in law who is a fitness instructer, but you can tell that prenatal fitness is not their main business. They have you move from back and forth from standing to chair to floor excercizes constantly during the video which I find unecessary. Also, the long workout is the same as the express workout, they just repeat the express workout. Keep in mind they use excercize bands for some of the excercises, so you will need to have or buy those as well. I also bought 10 minute prenatal pilates, which I like because you can customize your workout to be anywhere from 10 to 50 minutes, which is great when you are on a busy schedule.",1288396800,,782,4.475524475524476

The one thing I don't like is that the trainer sets up pillows, gives her water, and the band throughout the work out.  I don't have someone there doing that for me so I feel a little rushed at times.  Other that that this is a good DVD overall....I'm in my third trimester but still do the second trimester workout....it is the hardest one but still what I do on my easy days.

They hardly do anything for the warm up, if there was music I wasn't impressed. They also talk way too much!!! The good thing about this video is that there is a long and short version,so if you are short on time one day you can do the short version. The Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol. 1 on the other hand, is an excellent workout video. The warm up and cool down are both relaxing and feel very good. They have a beginners and advanced modification for each exercise. The music is upbeat and will keep you motivated through this workout! The great thing about this video is the workout is extensive enough to attain results but without pushing yourself so hard that you may hurt yourself or your baby.

3821192,4,B001VC995S,"I tried this DVD for the first time yesterday. I'm just 12 weeks so did the first trimester one. I agree there isn't much aerobic content but that's fine as I'm happy to walk and get some fresh air anyway. I didn't find it very challenging but I am used to doing spin, body pump, gym workouts 4/5 times a week. The only other DVD I do is Tracy Anderson but was a bit worried about it being suitable for pregnancy (a lot of stretching). I really enjoyed this workout and feel it probably makes me work at the right level (I'm used to pushing myself!)It made me warm and sweat a bit and I like the fact that rather than doing set after set (of push ups for example) they do a set of something else in between so you don't get too tired. I also liked the warm up and cool down and focus on breathing. I felt really revived and relaxed afterwards. My husband used to be a personal trainer and watched the DVD and said he really liked it as there is good instruction on posture and form to prevent any injuries. I plan to do this throughout my pregnancy and am feeling reassured there is an alternative to pushing myself in my normal gym classes and becoming a pregnant couch potato!

Thought I'd add to this review as I'm now 6 mths preg, still do the DVD once or twice a week along with a couple of gym sessions, (cross trainer, body pump). I really enjoy doing the DVD and find it very calming and meditative. I really like the 'pregnant girls together' vibe and find the second trimester workout makes me sweat and feel I've done some proper work but also refreshed.. though I have to say I am a bit dubious about the 'second trimester you have sooo much energy' comments! 'Labour lunges!' (said in American accent) has become a catch phrase with me and my husband but I actually find myself doing them around the house to ease my back! I haven't put much weight on, in fact haven't changed shape apart from the bump and think this is partly due to the DVD!",1285027200,,1956,4.258064516129032

Weaknesses:
- Each exercise uses only one muscle group - not efficient (completely different than Suzanne Bowen's long and lean prenatal video, definitely check that one out!)
- requires some extra equipment.
- chatting on the video is not a big problem, but other videos have options to turn that off, and this one doesn't.

All and all, I feel like our first attempt at an exercise DVD was a great one.  We produced this ourselves...money out of our own pocket and tried our best to keep the production days to 2 so we didn't spend more time away from the kids than needed.  Keri is such a fun and creative trainer and I feel like her workout is amazing.  We do state that this isn't cardio...the best way to get in cardio, I found, is by walking or riding a stationary bike. After we shot the video, which we had so much fun doing...we realized that our ""jokes"" might not seem so ""funny"" the 30th time.  We wish we had done a round without any talking at all.  But, have you ever tried to do a 45 min workout without talking??  NO FUN!  Anyway, lesson learned and if/when we do a follow-up, we will surely take all of your reviews into consideration.

3821196,5,B001VC995S,"I reviewed other prenatal workouts, both videos and guides, and this was definitely the best one.  The other prenatal videos either didn't work any muscles, or were flat out unsafe for pregnant women.
This video contains three separate workouts, one for each trimester.  Each workout has either a shorter or extended time so you can adjust according to your schedule.
Summer was seven months pregnant during the filming the videos.  Having a pregnant woman demonstrating the moves is very helpful, since your body changes how it moves so drastically during pregnancy.  Keri and Summer do a great job of explaining how to do the moves properly, even showing how to do modified crunches during pregnancy.  The pace is enough to get you a workout but not so strenuous to overextend a pregnant mom. The stretching segments feel particularly good during pregnancy.
This video made it easier to keep an exercise routine going when I was pregnant.  Equipment needed was minimal (such as large pillows), and the directions and positive statements made by Keri and Summer were clear and helpful.  This is a great bargain if you can't afford or get to a prenatal exercise class.",1284768000,,1168,4.958974358974359

There is not quite as much aerobic activity as I would have hoped, but the strength training is great for an intermediate workout. Lots of lunges and bicep curls left me sore the first time I did the 2nd trimester segment. I've had it for a little over a month and can now finish the entire 40 min workout even on my ""tired"" days. For days when I'm rushed or just exhausted the 10 minute quickie workout is great too. I had to purchase resistance bands for the arm and leg toning but otherwise didn't need any equipment (except pillows). I also use free weights in lieu of the resistance bands on some exercises because they are more comfortable. The two hosts (Summer and Kerri) are fun and energetic and keep the workout entertaining. My first prenatal video was Denise Austin's Fit & Firm Pregnancy and while I love her and her energy, I didn't feel it was terribly challenging. This video is a good next step. I also purchased the Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol. 1 w/ Karyne Steben at the same time and alternate the videos to keep things interesting.

I am just now (probably the last 2-3 weeks) getting back into working out, but I just can't stand workouts that make you feel like you are just wasting your time. This workout will be worth the 50 min you spend doing the exercises.

3821203,5,B001VC995S,"Summer Sanders reminds me of a young Sarah Palin. I loathe Sarah Palin, so it is a true testament to the quality of this video that I continue to work out to it every other day despite Sanders' resemblance to my arch nemesis. Yes, she rambles a bit (thankfully, her voice does not in any way resemble Palin's or it'd be a done deal no matter how good the workout), but I find the incessant talking distracting in such a way as to make the workout go faster. I am in good shape, and, at 22 weeks, this vid has kept me toned and fit without making me feel like I'm doing any unhealthy straining. It is a great workout; I have already recommended it to two friends.

I agree with the reviewer who said that the workout is a little short on cardio. I don't mind, though, because I like to get out and walk a lot anyway. What it lacks in cardio, it makes up for in toning of my core. This vid provides a great core workout even during the portions where the arms and legs are being worked out (many of the exercises require that you use your back and stomach for balancing even when you're not specifically working those areas).

3821205,3,B001VC995S,"Given the many positive reviews for this dvd, I was expecting a bit more. Although the dvd gives you variability in workouts depending on your trimester, I found Summer Sanders to be extremely annoying. She constantly prattles on about ""your booty"" and other such nonsense which is a huge detractor. I wish she came with a mute button! I found myself becoming more and more irritated through my workout and often turned off the dvd player before being done. If you can, rent this dvd through your local library before purchasing to see if you can tolerate Summer enough to make this purchase worth your while.

Update: 01/2015
I am now on my second pregnancy and have given this video a second try. I still believe that there was no reason to have given Summer a microphone. I get the sense that most of her chatter is attention-seeking. She can't stand not to be the center of attention and often makes nonsense comments to steal the show from her sister-in-law. If you can get past Summer's unnecessary chatter, the workout itself is good. I like that there is a cardio & strength component to it that many of my other videos lack. The only thing that is a little annoying is that, unlike Summer, most of us do not have a personal assistant setting things up for us or fetching us water while we are mid-exercise. This allows Summer to transition quickly between exercises but if you are doing it alone (even with your water and equipment nearby), you may be a few seconds late on starting some of the exercises. I now have this video in my regular workout rotation and have managed to tune out Summer entirely. This has made it much better so I am giving it an extra star.",1283126400,9,1675,4.528052805280528

She refers to your 'booty' quite a bit and just generally talks too much. The workout also does nothing for you cardio wise... you will never get winded. It's great for toning though. I would recommend doing something else if you are looking to keep up your cardio endurance during pregnancy.

3821208,5,B001VC995S,"Summer Sanders ""Prenatal Workout"" with Keri Crockett is a fantastic workout!  I recently purchased this DVD based on the various reviews I had read, and I was not disappointed.

Prior to becoming pregnant, I typically attended 4-5 exercies classes a week (step, yoga, pilates, Body Pump).  Since becoming pregnant, I'm finding it harder to make it to my classes.  Most begin around 7pm, I have an hour long commute home from work, and I'm just too tired at the end of the day to go the extra distance to my gym (it makes my commute an hour and 15 minutes). Purchasing a few pregnancy DVDs seemed to be the perfect solution.

I am currently 20 weeks pregnant with my first child and found the workout to be challenging enough to leave me feeling like I had gotten a good workout.  I've only done the second trimester workout so far, but I look forward to using this workout for the rest of my pregnancy.  The routines flowed nicely, and I like the options for the shorter workout. Most reviewers complained about the bantor between Summer and Keri, but if you are someone who is used to taking group exercise classes (especially Zumba or Body Pump - very canned programs), it's fairly typical and really not that annoying/different.  Throughout the workout, Keri hands Summer her exercise band.  I wish I had someone to hand me my props while I was working out!

I'd suggest watching the DVD prior to working out with it the first time so that you can evaluate the space you need to set up for the different sections.  Some transitions between exercises are a little bit faster than others.  You may need to pause the DVD to set up your pillows for the floor portion so that you don't get behind if you don't have enough space to keep your pillows set up for the entire workout.

Overall, I am extremely pleased with this DVD and I would highly recommend it!",1281571200,,1857,4.54054054054054

Well, Summer Sanders Prenatal Workout is both a great and effective workout, and hosted by a real person who makes it fun! She is good at engaging her audience, being silly, and giving reminders without being bossy. She laughs at herself, makes jokes (but not too many), and practices talking to herself to maintain her breathing (which I felt stupid doing, until I saw her do it!) The DVD is split into 3 trimester segments, each one with varying routines and energy levels. Her sister-in-law, Carrie, is there to give a lot of instructional advice as well, and the two have a great rapport. After each workout I feel more toned, and a little breathless (when I really push myself!). They make a point of saying this isn't a weight-loss video, but it is great for strength training, and they give a lot of tips for laboring positions, which I hope I can remember when I get to the birthing center!

One note: many exercises call for special bands which I did not have (having bought the video used from a friend), but 5lb weights can easily replace the bands for every exercise.",1280966400,,1179,4.535211267605634

3821220,4,B001VC995S,"A lot of prenatal workout DVD's just tell you what accommodations to make as your pregnancy progresses, but show the same workout the whole 9 months.  This one is great because it has 3 different workout routines depending on your trimester, and they are really geared to what you can do at each stage.  Each one has two versions: full length (50 min) or express (30 min), depending on your time allowance.

I got the DVD in my second trimester so I didn't try out the first workout, but the other two are good.  I think the 3rd one is the best; Summer and her trainer/sister-in-law Keri keep the pace a little slower so that you can keep up, but do enough that you feel like you are staying in shape even when you can't do many things easily anymore.  Their banter can be annoying after you've heard it over and over, but they are really natural and friendly so it's not that bad, and it is worth leaving the sound on because Keri gives precise instructions to get the most from the exercises.

I didn't give it 5 stars because the full length workouts don't add anything new, you just basically do the same routine twice, which I found a little disappointing.  I would also have liked a post-natal workout to use as a transition back into a normal exercise routine.  The product summary doesn't tell you, but you need an exercise band for this DVD, and you also need a chair and pillows for the 3rd trimester workout.",1277596800,,1419,4.430769230769231

I do not have the ability to go to a gym as I work full time and care for my 2 1/2 yr old. Sometimes, it is too hot to be outside so I thought the video would give me another option.
I currently use this DVD 3-4 times a week in the mornings before I go to work.

What I think is great about the video is there are three levels from which you could would pick.... 1st trimester, 2nd trimester and 3rd trimester and in those you have the ability to choose the original or express version. Original version I think is along 45minutes to 1 hr. The express version I believe is about 40 minutes.
I have been using this DVD for about a month and I do notice a difference in my legs and arms. The stomach is focused on as well as stretching which is nice.
They exercise a little of each and even though the pace is slower, I am sweating by the end. Traditionally, I do the express version due to time in the mornings.

The one drawback is Summer Sanders and this is not even really a drawback. Summer is kinda annoying and the banter between her and the instructor ( her sister-in-law) is sometimes annoying too.
In general, I would tell anyone to get this DVD as it is good for all fitness levels and I do feel very good when I am on schedule with this exercise.
Just learn to ignore the annoying banter and focus on the instructor and you will be fine.

Also, suggestion is to go find the bands they use---- I was using free weights which was OK but, there is a difference with the bands especially in the stretching section.
I think I purchased my bands at Marshalls for $7.00 so they are pretty inexpensive.

All in all a good find- easy to follow and worth the money spent.
Hope this helps!",1277510400,10,1765,4.167155425219941
3821222,4,B001VC995S,"i enjoyed the dvd, but i wish it had some cardio. i ordered two dvds this one and the denise austin one. neither was what i was expecting, but i definitely thought this was the better of the two.",1277164800,,195,4.0256410256410255
3821223,4,B001VC995S,"I would definitely recommend this DVD, but would include a recommendation. As others have said, you need a resistance band. I have only a really tight/heavy resistance band. As a result, I have to do several of the exercises (biceps, triceps) on my knees or they simply are too difficult and I have really strong arms. The hip abductor/adductor is also nearly impossible. So, if you are going to buy this DVD, get an easy or medium resistance band.

I am 30 weeks and still doing the 2nd trimester workout since the 3rd trimester workout feels a little bit too easy. I'm not sure if this is medically advisable or not and it would be nice if the introduction spoke to this.

The one other thing that would be nice is more concentration on form the first set opf repetitions of an exercise. The first time I did the workout, I wasn't sure my form was correct on the first repetitions. It's possible form is addressed earlier during in the 1st trimester section, which I skipped because I could still run at that point.

Pre-pregnancy, I was in really good shape, and while this DVD does not help my cardio, it at least keeps me toned and the exercises are all safe for pregnant ladies.",1277078400,,1184,4.497674418604651

It is broken into each trimester but I wouldn't limit yourself to only doing the trimester workout that you are in.  Summer does all 3 workout at 7 months so you can follow the first trimester workout even when you are in your 2nd or 3rd.  It allows you to have more variety.  I rotate this video with walking, the Perfect Pregnancy workout Vol 1 and the complete prenatal Vinyasa Yoga & short Forms dvd.",1276560000,,527,4.381443298969073

I only watched the video as much as I needed in order to get the routine down, then copied it on paper and exercise without it now. I can go at my own pace that way, too.
My last pregnancy did not end to well because I strained my rib muscles on the right side doing a workout. That put me into labor at 34 weeks. So, to anyone who exercises during pregnancy, please use caution! If you feel something weird (especially in or around the abdominal cavity), REST it, DON'T OVER DO IT, DON'T WORK THROUGH IT!
Overall, the work outs are good ones. They are challenging and make me feel stronger and fitter. They would even be good for women who are not pregnant. If the conversation was more professional and the music less irritating, I would happily give this video 5 stars.",1276560000,,892,4.379518072289157
3821226,5,B001VC995S,I really love this video.  Especially since it goes by trimester and they give you a short or long version of it.  It seems like the long version (about 1 hour) is twice of the short but it is really good.  One thing is you WILL need a resist band to go along with this video.  That is the only thing additional but I wish they told you this before buying it because then I got it in and had to buy the band separately which wasn't much only $10 but I had to wait to do the video again till the band came in.,1275868800,,508,3.8095238095238093
3821227,3,B001VC995S,"I was a little bit disappointed with this workout after reading all the other positive reviews. The workout starts with a good warm up, but then the main part of the workout consists of alternating squats/lunges with various types of reps using the resistance band. Ok workout, but pretty boring. THEN, in the extended workout they just repeat the exact same workout (squats & reps) AGAIN! It was boring enough the first time! I wonder what was the point of making an extended workout (about 50 min in total) when they couldn't think of enough different material to fill the time. I also skip the ab work section which is basically crunches on an incline because I am worried about making my abdominal seperation worse.
If you are just looking to buy one prenatal workout dvd, I would recommend Erin O'Brien's Prenatal Fitness Fix - it is a really fun and energizing aerobic workout and the time just flies by when you are doing it.",1275782400,3,932,4.654545454545454

3821229,3,B001VC995S,"This is an ok dvd.  I'm on my 3rd pregnancy, and get bored of doing the same thing every day.  Having different workouts for the 3 trimesters was a great idea.  The instructors are bouncy and whimsical, horsing around with eachother in a very fake living room, but if you mute them, you'll be able to stand it.  What I like about it is that you get a great upper-body workout; lots of variants on push-ups and arm curls etc. (she does them with straps, but I just use weights; seems to work fine).  I definitely feel my shoulders and arms get the goodness of it.  BUT here's what I don't like: I don't really feel anything much in thighs or butt.  I want a proper workout for whole body, not just the top!  After I do this, I'm still feeling like I need to go for a run; which I guess is a bit much for pregnancy, but even a brisk walk does something. Not enough cardio.  There's standing around, having sips of water.  If I only have half an hour before the baby wakes up, I don't want to waste it watching people having sips of water.  I don't think a longish dvd ought to leave one feeling not-quite-exercised.  The other problem I have is that it's not in segments, and it feels slow.  I'd rather be able to pick a fifteen minute section for upper-body, say, and just do that in combination with something else, to fit into my schedule. So: it's kind of useful, I'll do it some more times, it helps keep my arms toned; but I wouldn't get it again.",1275436800,88,1451,4.213768115942029

I was looking for something that would make me sweat, but safely. In my first pregnancy I did The Perfect Pregnancy Workout, but I lost it. So I thought a new one was due, I am learning easier said than done.

This video is ok but a bit long for silly reasons. If I wanted to take drink breaks I can simply do that at my leisure I don't need her to tell me to. This video workout could be condensed if some of the unnecessary commentary and plan time were omitted. I am going to find my other dvd and in the meantime I have ordered the 10 Minute Prenatal Workout. Why is it so hard to find a smooth, safe, but keep you moving dvd?

All in all, it feels like a good workout, but like I said its drawn out and it is quite repetitive. Everything I did in the beginning repeats itself 15 minutes later. Hope this helps you moms looking for a good workout like me.",1275264000,8,1029,4.114427860696518

I had been doing aerobics for over a year preceeding my purchase and was looking for something to keep me in shape yet especially for pregnancy. This targets muscles you will use during pregnancy and labor. The music is fun and not distracting and the ladies in the workout are nice without being annoying. I would recommend it for someone like me who likes to stay in shape but is not an 'expert'.

After a few sessions of the 30 minute workout I stepped it up to the full length (60 minute) workout.  It is still a challenge for me, but it feels great. There is a great combination of legs, back, arms, and abs that makes for a complete workout.  My only complaint is that the 60 minute workout is basically a repeat of the 30 minute workout.

The moves are easy to master and both her and Kerri talk about modifications that can be made throughout the workout.  I entered my 2nd trimester a few weeks ago, and thought, ""hmmm, they'll probably make the 2nd trimester workout much easier than the first"".  I was sorely (literally!) mistaken.

2. In 3rd trimester workout the ""trainer"" will say to do something and then prgnt lady will say ok hold on let me stretch-which is weird-this is a workout video pick a direction and give it-it almost feels like she is making things up or adding things in along the way-ugh!

I would have rated it 5 stars but the music is lacking in interest and originality (I listen to my MP3 player out of one ear and listen to her with the other)but I guess it is good for people that don't have alot of rhythm? ;)
I started with Terri's video but do this more more because to be honest It is a little less overwhelming and more encouraging...but, don't get me wrong it still gets your heart rate up.  It's just not 1 1/2 hours long like Hot Mamas...I would say the Cardio is definately mixed.  It is more conditioning based that a true 'cardio' video...but it is for looser ligamented pregnant women so I understand that.  Overall, I very much like the video I just didn't read any reviews before I bought it that pointed out the lacking music (has some obviously but very monotonous) but this isn't the main point of working out.

So, I always try the short version (more than 30minutes) but still experienced muscle pain next day without using the rope! If you use the rope, it'll give your muscle more pressure, I assure you. This DVD is for those who are serious to stay fit during pregnancy after all. They even show sit-ups for pregnant women!

3821266,5,B001VC995S,"I really enjoy this workout dvd.  I wanted a prenatal dvd that focused on strength and conditioning, and this is it!  I love the fact that you can have a ""quick"" 30 minute workout on the days you really don't feel like working out.  I didn't start using this video until my second trimester, and felt really out of shape as I didn't work out at all the first 14 weeks of my pregnacy.  This video (along with the Erin O'Brien prenatal video) has made me feel stronger and increased my energy level. (I'm 22 weeks now)  I HIGHLY recommend this video.

Oh, and on a side note - Summer Sander's is cheerful and down to earth - I really appreciate that she's 7 months pregnant in the video.  It makes me feel like if she can do it, I can do it.  I feel like i'm working out at the gym in one of my workout classes.  It's great!",1264723200,,822,4.0875

I've had trouble with other prenatal workouts not being vigorous enough, but this one's perfect. It's a great all-around strength training workout, with a circuit of moves to tone all major muscle groups. There is 1-hour workout, and a 30-min express workout. The 1-hour workout does the circuit twice; the express only once. You need a resistance band for the workout. There is a brief cardio/warm-up section at the beginning to get your heart rate up, but it's mostly a toning workout. Summer Sanders, and her trainer, Keri Crockett, are pleasant and upbeat. They do a good job leading the workout and are not at all annoying to listen to over and over. I highly recommend this DVD!",1264377600,2,799,4.797101449275362

I have five prenatal exercise videos, which I have been rotating along with some Leslie Sansone videos.  I really like this video, I like that it is broken up into 3 trimesters and an express option as well.  I find that this video along with the others has helped me to stay in great condition, stay toned, keep my weight gain in check, and feel very good so far throughout my pregnancy.

First, the chemistry between Summer and the trainer, Keri is awesome.  So real and honest.  You feel as though you are standing right next to them.

Second, its a perfect supplement to my cardio at the gym.  It focuses on toning and toning right.  When the baby comes and my gym time becomes limited, the dvd will continue to be in my routine.  Its easy, yet challenging and in 45 minutes you have completed an entire body work out.

I highly recommend it!",1263772800,,668,4.196850393700787

It has three different workouts for each trimester, and each includes cardio and toning (but mainly toning...the cardio is very easy). You need a resistance band for the toning, but I bought one for $6 at Target and now I use it all the time. Summer is very encouraging and extremely pregnant in the video, so she's very motivating. What I like best is knowing the moves are safe for pregnant women.",1263686400,,541,4.587628865979381

3821275,5,B001VC995S,"I asked for and received two prenatal videos for Christmas.  This one is by FAR the better of the two and the best I've looked at (of many...).  This is definitely a sort of cheesy aerobics sort of thing that I thought I would never do.  Something about it just smacks too much of jazzercize or something.  Where are my hot pink leg warmers...

Anyway, semi-cheesiness aside, it's a great workout.  Your heart rate definitely gets going and -- like another reviewer -- I have that ""I worked out yesterday"" feeling when I get up in the morning.  As others have also mentioned, this is a really great buy for what you get.  You get three trimesters worth of (very similar, but still) workouts.  There's a full-length that goes for an hour and an express that's only about 30 minutes.  Summer Sanders' enormous belly is also a huge inspiration to keep going.  I'm incredibly pleased to have this video and I look forward to using it in this pregnancy and the next.",1262304000,4,961,4.52906976744186

Now I stay at home because we moved to another country so I wasn't doing anything but sitting on the couch. I started the program and it's super easy it starts off not advanced like most exercise movies and it's easy to follow. It has 1st trimester 2nd trimester and 3rd trimester! So you don't have to worry about straining yourself!,1261267200,3,462,4.32183908045977
3821277,5,B001VC995S,"This video is amazing! I starting using it around my 8th week and am now in my 14th week. The video is set up into three sections: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester workouts. Each one is different and each one helps you feel like you're doing something great for yourself and your baby. Summer Sanders is cheerful and informative, without being cheesy. The video is easy to follow and provides you with an excellent workout for each trimester. I recommend this video to anyone who wants to continue to exercise during pregnancy or even just starting out with a fitness routine in pregnancy. I hadn't exercise in a long while and was able still able to do the exercise, though I have to admit, I was so sore after the first few times! LOL My body quickly became used to exercising again and the workouts helped me feel better physically and mentally. I'm so thankful I bought this video. I hope she has one for after the baby is born too.

3821279,5,B001VC995S,"This DVD is great! There are three sections for each trimester. I thought the work out is just right! It's not an overload, and the amount of effort and strength used is great for a pregnant woman! As they say in the video, ""it's not about losing weight, but staying healthy"". They do a variety of things, such as a warm-up, toning muscles, stretching, and some yoga. You will need a ""stretching band"" and some pillows!",1259107200,3,419,4.526315789473684
3821280,5,B001VC995S,"I am 24 weeks preggers and absolutely love this video!  I have another yoga video but I use this one on days I need a good workout and some movement!  I love that it is broken down into trimesters and within the trimesters, there is a ""Full Length Workout"" (for days when you have LOTSA energy to spare) and ""Express Workout""!  Summer is so encouraging and is pregnant as well (which is always a plus, so you know they are dealing with the same issues).  Her sis-in-law (Keri) is a personal trainer who adds some expertise to the video!  The only things you need are a resistance cord, pillows, and a chair.  The workouts are basic, nothing extreme!  At the end, there is a great stretching section as well!  You can't go wrong with this DVD!  I just hope Summer & Keri come out with a post-pregnancy DVD!

UPDATE:
I used this DVD faithfully throughout my pregnancy (eventually stayed with this DVD instead of the yoga one)!  I cannot say enough for the energy this workout gave me plus the 'feel-good' effect it had on me!  After all was said and done (and a healthy baby was born), I gained only 35 pounds!  Which meant it was easier to get back in shape post baby!!  And I attribute that in large part to this DVD!!  (Still on the lookout for a post-pregnancy DVD with Summer!)

And now, I am gifting my pregnant sisters and friends DVD's of encouragement. A workout that is efficient, effective and fun for a barren woman is, no doubt, something they are going to be psyched to have for the gestation.

After reviewing several different prenatal videos, this one seemed different. Let me tell you, it's awesome!  The trainer, Keri, does a great job of providing different workouts for your growing belly, and gives you the option of an express workout. (Helpful when I tried to use the excuse ""I just don't have time today..."") I never felt winded, but still got that great ""workout sore feeling"" the next day. Summer's 7 month pregnant belly motivates you to believe, ""if she can do it, I can do it.""
  I cannot believe how much better I felt during this pregnancy, and truly believe it was the reason why I had an easier labor with my second baby. I even worked out the morning I went into labor! I fit back into my pre-pregnancy jeans MONTHS before I did with my first baby, and I highly recommend this video for any pregnant gal.",1255564800,144,972,4.47457627118644

I also am a little dissappointed that she just wears a sports bra while she is seven months pregnant. She has a cute baby belly, but it is just one of those things that I don't like to see anyone's navel--pregnant or not.

I will not go into the details of the DVD structure etc. b/c it's been commented on already but I would like to say that this is a great aerobic set of exercises for an average pregnant woman. I like that the instructors do not rush through the video like crazy so you can really concentrate on your breathing, muscle strengthening, and can relax when you need a break.

Finally, I found a video that had different workouts for each trimester AND they actually left me sore the next morning!  Keri and Summer make you feel like you are working out with your friends at home.  They have several different intensity levels that you can do if you are feeling tired or extra motivated that day. They keep you entertained and most importantly, keep you in shape.  My body bounced right back after my second pregnancy.

The problem with most pregnancy workouts is that there is little working out.  It's like they think that because you are pregnant, you don't really want it.  Not true here.  Keri and Summer have designed workouts for not only the 3 trimesters, but for different intensities as well.  You can opt for longer or shorter programs which is great because when you are pregnant, there are definitely good days and bad days.  Also, let's face it, during these long 9 months, it's sometimes hard to motivate to go to the gym (especially if there is another child already in the picture) so this is a great alternative that makes it easy (and you no longer have the excuse to not exercise).  And really, watching Summer is motivation enough to stay fit during pregnancy.  This is my new go to gift for all expecting mothers.",1254009600,,984,4.641618497109826

Lucky for me, Keri guided me through workouts via e-mail and phone consultations.  Lucky for you, you can have her on your big screen!  Thanks to Keri, I had amazing workouts, felt great throughout my whole pregnancy and returned to my pre-pregnant body within months.  This video is perfect for those who go to the gym all of the time as well as those who want to stay toned.  It is definitely not ""too easy"" but you can take it easy throughout the whole video if you feel you need to.  Keri and Summer cater to ALL TYPES OF WOMEN!

I love that the music, atmosphere and approach are friendly, relaxed, upbeat but never obnoxious. Summer is sweet and friendly, never seems to be showing off her athleticism or pushing you to do too much.
I am in relatively good shape and I find the intensity is perfect, I am not trying to reach new heights of fitness here, just to maintain or slightly increase my strength and endurance during pregnancy and prepare for childbirth. I believe staying in good shape has helped me have wonderful births in the past. If you are the rah! Rah! type of excerciser, you may find the format kinda boring, but remember, there is one program for each trimester, fourteen weeks, thats it, you will be out of your pregnancy before you know it!
