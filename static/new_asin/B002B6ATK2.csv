This is a big complicated, but a really great movie if you pay attention.  Haruka as a cyborg is fabulous.  I've watched it several times since its arrival a couple weeks ago.  It's going on my shelf, but i'm going to watch it again ever so often.",1514592000,,356,4.587301587301587
8360781,5,B002B6ATK2,"Stumbled across this movie when I attended Anime Expo in Los Angeles last summer. They were supposed to show Death Note:The Movie but due to some red tape, were unable to get permission so they wound up showing this instead. A brief summary of the plot: A mystery girl shows up while Jiro(the main character)is celebrating his birthday by which for some reason, he winds up celebrating on his own each year. The two of them wind up sharing an evening of mischief pulling a dine-and-dash after running up a hefty tab at a fancy restaurant. Following a comical chase through Chinatown,the mystery girl later reveals she has come from the future and must return even though they have just started to get to know one another. The movie fast forwards one year to the anniversary of their meeting when we witness her return from the future. We learn that she is a cyborg that has been sent to protect Jiro from dangers that are to come as well as preventing certain tragic events from coming to pass.

The film is very amusing as we see how the cyborg learns to understand what it means to be human. It also has many touching moments as Jiro begins to fall in love with her and has to deal with the fact that she is unable to respond to him in the way that he wants her to. I know this discription isn't doing the movie justice but it really is a touching & cute movie. If you enjoyed movies like Starman or Mannequin, I think you'll really enjoy this one.",1262649600,,1450,4.390334572490707
