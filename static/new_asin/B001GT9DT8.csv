3619662,5,B001GT9DT8,"This anime was good, he story line was different compared to other animes. The ending is different and even happy for the gang, but I believe that this anime need a second season to better explain what happens to each character.",1299456000,,228,4.585365853658536
3619663,5,B001GT9DT8,It is a great story with lots of fun moments. It has a certain charm about it and a compelling story line that makes you want to watch the next episode.  Great life lessons are thrown throughout.,1293494400,,195,4.27027027027027
3619664,3,B001GT9DT8,"There are a lot of girls who will enjoy this, but I was not one of them.

I'll give you the good points first: it is rather cute and has it's funny moments. Animation style itself was detailed and very colorful. There were a few interesting twists and the relationships between the various team members were enjoyable to see (unrequited love, friendship, etc)

Bad points:

English dub: the voice actors shouted most of their lines. They weren't ""acting"" them. They traded volume for emotion. It does come with Japanese language/English sub setting though, so not too much of a drawback.

Some of the episodes seemed to be kind of unorganized. The plot itself is original, but the plot elements (what happened episode-to-episode) were not (for example; two people who argue a lot switching bodies, de-aging, turning into an animal, etc). It also became increasingly repititious (every single episode, Nina would get in some kind of trouble, the boys would rescue her, we might meet a new team, we see a rather overused piece of animation showing their powers - it was pretty much the same thing every episode - just with slightly different problems).

I both liked and disliked the ending. (Trying not to give anything away, sorry if I do) The pearl twist was interesting. What I don't like is that she doesn't choose. It's great that they can all be together, but still disappointing. I understand why they did that, but still don't like it.

Overall: it's a cute watch for say a rainy day, definitely for girls, and there will be quite a few who would appreciate this - there are some cute romance type scenes and cute boys. Maybe not for anime lovers.

If you do buy it, I recommend watching it in Japanese - it really does improve it.",1258848000,,1738,4.697368421052632
3619665,4,B001GT9DT8,"I simply loved this DVD. There was the good things, and the bad things

Good Things:
Very Funny
Entertaining
Also comes in Japanese with subtitles

Bad Things:
Sometimes Voice Acting sounds cheesy
Storyline is all over the place in certain episodes
Episodes may be repetitive(because in every episode, Nina is in trouble and gets saved by Ichii and Zero)

Overall, I rate it 4 stars. It's good, but not something to tell your anime-loving friends.

This is a good anime for people who like Romance, Magic, Fantasy, and Comedy. This is a Shoujo anime, mostly girls will enjoy this.

I suggest to buy this even if you don't like the english dub, because it also comes in Japanese with english subs. Hope this review helps!",1248048000,8,720,4.728
3619666,4,B001GT9DT8,"Save me lollipop is cute, funny, and has magical action. I was kind of suspicious about it, but it is really cute and funny. It is everyones opinions, but I love it; I hope the ending is worthwhile as well. It is a little repetitive with the jokes, but it is a cute romantic comedy. Overall I give this anime 4.5 out of 5 stars",1245369600,4,327,4.046153846153846
3619667,3,B001GT9DT8,"This story is about a girl named Nina.  Nina's dream is that someday she'll meet a handsome prince who will become her protector.  One day, as she's having cake with some friends at a sidewalk caf, she finds an object that looks like a piece of hard candy on her plate.  She puts it in her mouth and bites down on it, and that's when everything goes crazy.  Two guys show up at her table, swearing that they'll protect her from anything, and all of a sudden shields go up, and flying bodies start flowing around the shield and crashing everywhere.  Nina, of course, swallows the ""hard candy"" whole during the excitement.

The two guys escape with her to a quiet place, and begin to explain the situation to her.  It seems that she has just witnessed the beginning of a ""final exam"" for students who wish to become professional sorcerers.  The exam consists of the test proctor dropping an object called the ""Crystal Pearl"" somewhere at random in the human world.  The examinees pair off and go searching for the pearl.  Whichever team finds the pearl gets to graduate.  The teams have until Christmas to locate the pearl and return with it to the magical world.  Nina has swallowed the Crystal Pearl.

I thought this story might be kind of fun but it was just... loud.  Seems like the voice actors shouted about half of their lines.  I hate that.  I understand that the situations were supposed to be exciting and dangerous, but can't you find some other way to express that besides shouting all the time?  And with all of the different powers that the examinees had (hypnosis, summoning, talismans, barriers, elemental attacks, etc.), don't you think that you might come up with something besides the same old tricks and traps (body swapping, age transformations, animal transformations,... my God, they even borrowed the voice stealing from ""The Little Mermaid"").

There was one episode that showed some imagination, though.  And surprisingly, it revolved around one of the other teams.  It seems that one of the girls, San, was regarded as cursed in her home world.  San's mother became ill shortly after San was born, and it seemed as though the more time that San spent with her mother, the sicker her mother became.  San's grandfather forbade them to be together, but even so, San's mother eventually died.  And everybody blamed poor little San, even though it was obvious that San loved her mother.  The only one who stood by San was her cousin, Forte.  (This episode also had a song in it that was really creepy.)

All in all, I have to say that this one was a disappointment.  Granted, it ended well, but it had the potential to be so much better.",1238284800,4,2656,4.668103448275862

3619673,3,B001GT9DT8,"Sweet Nina is a romantic at heart that wants to find a prince to defend her honor and protect her. She soon gets her wish times two, but trouble came with it. Two boys, Zero and Ichii, are sorcerers from another world. They are taking part in a highly competitive test with a lot at stake. The test is taken in pairs and many sorcerers are participating, but only one team can pass. And the only way to pass is to find the small Crystal Pearl that was dropped on Earth. However, Nina mistaking the Crystal Pearl for a piece of candy, ate it! Desperate to win, the sorcerer teams will go to any lengths to get the Crystal Pearl even if it means harming Nina. Zero and Ichii take it upon themselves to keep Nina and the Crystal Pearl safe until time runs out on the test. Though they have magical powers of there own, it won't be easy fighting off so many other teams with their own magic.

This is an adorable and cute anime. The story is a bit unorganized at times and repetitive. It's also fast-paced, sometimes too fast, but exciting with lots of magical battles. There is lots of humor and it's creative and fun. The characters are unique and lovable and keep things interesting. There is even a little romance. The artwork is very colorful and the voices are more high-pitched and cute sounding. It's an enjoyable anime to watch. (26 episodes)",1390089600,,1347,4.431451612903226
