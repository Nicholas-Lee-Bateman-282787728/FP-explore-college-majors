8721090,5,B00ZX4XVH2,"Philo Vance was the first private detective of the sound era.
He appeared in thirteen films between 1929 and 1947.
Four were produced by Paramount, three by Warner Brothers, three by MGM, and three by PRC (Producer's Releasing Corporation).

The Warner  and MGM titles are in a box from Warner Archive:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Philo-Vance-Murder-Case-Collection/dp/B00BBI7EZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Philo Vance Murder Case Collection</a>
If you want all thirteen Philo Vance movies, you need to buy both boxes.
There is no overlap.
Eight actors played Philo Vance:

1) WILLIAM POWELL:
The great William Powell (five years before he played detective Nick Charles in The Thin Man) was the first actor to play Philo Vance.
The OnesMedia collection has his first three appearances in the role - the Warner box has his final effort:
- 1929: THE CANARY MURDER CASE - Paramount (OnesMedia box)
- 1929: THE GREENE MURDER CASE - Paramount (OnesMedia box)
- 1930: THE BENSON MURDER CASE - Paramount (OnesMedia box)
- 1933: THE KENNEL MURDER CASE - Warner Bros. (Warner Archive box)

The first three are extremely difficult to find.
Picture quality is not great, but I could understand 98% of the dialogue, which is rare in early talkies.
These are not great films, but they are historically important.
The CANARY MURDER CASE started out as a silent film in 1928, but Paramount decided to re-shoot several scenes with sound, and to dub sound onto existing footage.
The result is awkward.
Early sound technicians were worried that overlapping dialogue would confuse the audience, so actors were instructed to insert lengthy pauses between lines.
Very slow going.
Silent movie legend Louise Brooks is the murder victim in THE CANARY MURDER CASE.
She was in Germany making silent films when Paramount cabled her to return to Hollywood to dub her scenes with sound.
She refused.
Her voice was dubbed by a different actress and Louise Brooks' Hollywood career was over.
- Eugene Palette was comic relief as Sergeant Heath in all four films.
- Future star Jean Arthur was a supporting player in the first two films.

2) BASIL RATHBONE:
- 1930: THE BISHOP MURDER CASE - MGM (in the Warner Archive box)

The great Basil Rathbone (nine years before he played Sherlock Holmes) was the second actor to play Philo Vance.
His portrayal is closer to the Philo Vance of the novels - not very flattering - basically an upper-class twit, but a very clever one.
Technically, this 1930 MGM talkie is a considerable advance over the 1929-30 Paramount films.
It has a surprising amount of outdoor filming, including an automobile ride which appears to have been filmed on the back of a flatbed truck in actual traffic.

3) WARREN WILLIAM:
- 1934: THE DRAGON MURDER CASE - Warner Bros. (Warner Archive box)
- 1939: THE GRACIE ALLEN MURDER CASE - Paramount (OnesMedia box)

The great - I think he's great - Warren William was the third actor to play Philo Vance.
He's one of my all-time favorite actors, but I'll admit that he is an acquired taste.
Warren William had a remarkable face -
He looked like Satan - which should have stereotyped him as a screen villain, but his personality and sense of humor overcame this obvious handicap.
This Philo Vance is not as serious as Powell or Rathbone, but he is devilish fun to watch.
THE GRACIE ALLEN MURDER CASE is not a cheesy as it sounds.
S.S. Van Dine actually wrote a novel with that title in 1938 (George Burns and Gracie Allen were friends of the author).
Gracie Allen is wonderful - Warren William as Philo Vance basically takes over George Burns' role as Gracie's straight man.

Warner Brothers also cast Warren William as Perry Mason in four films (starting in 1934).
In 1939, he moved to Columbia and made the first of nine appearances as The Lone Wolf - basically playing the same character in all three series.
All are available on DVD. See the GUIDE TO B-MOVIE DETECTIVES ON DVD at the end of this review.

4-8) B-MOVIE ACTORS:
Unlike the first three, these five actors never quite made it past supporting parts in A-Movies.
But they were leading men in B-Movies:
- 1935: Paul Lukas in THE CASINO MURDER CASE - MGM (Warner Archive box)
- 1936: Edmund Lowe in THE GARDEN MURDER CASE - MGM (Warner Archive box)
- 1940: James Stephenson in CALLING PHILO VANCE - Warner Bros. (Warner Archive box)
- 1947: William Wright in PHILO VANCE RETURNS - P.R.C. (OnesMedia box)
- 1947: Alan Curtis in PHILO VANCE'S GAMBLE - P.R.C. (OnesMedia box)
- 1947: Alan Curtis in PHILO VANCE'S SECRET MISSION - P.R.C. (OnesMedia box)

The B-Movie units at MGM and Warners made some quality low-budget films.
P.R.C. (Producers Releasing Corporation) had a less exalted reputation (well-deserved), but their films are not without a certain charm.
I just like B-Movies.

EXTRA: OnesMedia includes an unsold TV pilot - PHILO VANCE, DETECTIVE - which turns out to be a severely edited (18:33) version of PHILO VANCE'S SECRET MISSION.

LOST FILMS: There were two additional Philo Vance films from the 1930s that are not in either collection:
- 1936: THE SCARAB MURDER CASE with Wilfrid Hyde-White as Philo Vance.
No prints of this British production are known to exist. The British Film Institute has placed it on its 75 Most Wanted list of lost films.
- 1937: NIGHT OF MYSTERY (Paramount) with Grant Richards as Philo Vance
(remake of The Greene Murder Case).
Not a lost film, but apparently the only print is in the Library of Congress, which doesn't regard restoration of this B-movie as a high priority.
Does anyone have more information?
--------------------------------------------------

OnesMedia has produced the only available collection of seven rare Philo Vance movies, and is selling them at a very nice price.
Seven DVDs in a CD-size plastic clamshell case with soft plastic sleeves (the same packaging this company uses for CDs of old radio shows).
Picture quality ranges from pretty bad to pretty good, but OnesMedia did a heroic job of cleaning up the sound.
No subtitles, but I wasn't expecting any at this price.
These are DVD-Rs, but so is the Warner collection.
I had no problems with playback.
Finally, THERE IS NO COMPETITION.

P.S. There was an early production problem: PHILO VANCE'S GAMBLE was missing the ending - it stopped mid-sentence at 49:35. The corrected version runs 1:01:07.
I was an early buyer and found OnesMedia's customer service to be very helpful in supplying the corrected DVD.
E-mail OnesMedia if you have any problems

GUIDE TO B-MOVIE DETECTIVES ON DVD
A-Movies had bigger budgets and stars, and were top-billed in a double-feature.
B-Movies occupied the bottom of the program.
Some of the longer-lasting series started out as A-Movies, but ended up as B-Movies (Philo Vance began at Paramount and ended up at PRC)

PART ONE: REFORMED CRIMINALS TURNED PRIVATE EYE
- Boston Blackie, the Lone Wolf and the Saint are reformed jewel thieves. Still viewed with suspicion by the police.
- The Falcon has a shady past (never quite explained).
- Arsene Lupin is an unreformed jewel thief who sometimes helps the police if it serves his ends.
- The Crime Doctor used to be an Organized Crime Boss. He never actually reformed, but was conked over the head and woke up with amnesia.

PHILIP MARLOWE / SAM SPADE
These two detectives were the most famous Private Eyes of all time, but they don't really belong on this list.
They were A-Movie detectives all the way:
- 1931 The Maltese Falcon: Ricardo Cortez as Sam Spade
- 1936 Satan Met a Lady: Warren William as Sam Spade - adapted from 'The Maltese Falcon' by Dashiell Hammett
- 1941 The Maltese Falcon: Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade
- 1944 Murder, My Sweet: Dick Powell as Philip Marlowe - adapted from 'Farewell, My Lovely' by Raymond Chandler
- 1946 The Big Sleep: Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe.
- 1947 Lady in the Lake: Robert Montgomery as Philip Marlowe.
- 1947 The Brasher Doubloon: George Montgomery as Philip Marlowe - adapted from 'The High Window"" by Raymond Chandler

But two Philip Marlowe novels were adapted as B-Movies for other detectives:
- 1942 Time to Kill (Lloyd Nolan as Michael Shayne) - adapted from 'The High Window' by Raymond Chandler
- 1942 The Falcon Takes Over (George Sanders as The Falcon)) - adapted from 'Farewell My Lovely' by Raymond Chandler
