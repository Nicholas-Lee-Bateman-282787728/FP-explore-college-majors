7954074,5,B00005U2ER,"First off: Wai Lana changed my life. I needed an outlet for all my stress and a way to be physically active that wasn't hard on my joints. I was only 22 when I started but I have always had very weak joints due to a genetic condition. It has been five years now and I rarely go a few days without doing one of her DVDs. When I finally did go to a yoga class they wanted to know who my teacher was because I was incredibly flexible! They were surprised to find I never had a yoga class. In my opinion, these movies intentionally and unintentionally embody the spirit of yoga- calmness, peace, strength, energy and disarming humor. While some might think of Wai Lana's outfits, makeup, accent, and music as a bit retro, ridiculous, and foolish, I think it's the perfect lens through which to practice yoga. It ensures you don't take yourself too seriously, and to let yourself release your boundaries by being a little silly/ participating in something a bit ridiculous in the current view.

 This particular one took me from novice to being able to do headstand unassisted without a single visit to a yoga class in my life. It's my favorite DVD of the series, probably out of everything she has. I've been doing this same old sequence for 5 years now, and it still feels simultaneously strengthening and relaxing. I expect I'll keep watching it for many decades to come!",1464652800,,1369,4.516129032258065
7954075,5,B00005U2ER,"In the 1 min intro, she tells you this is for serious yoga practitioners who see yoga as more for showing off or just physical stretching but also a mind/body connection.
She is very calm & relaxing, helps you to center & relax no matter how jump, or irritated you are. She's one of the only yoga teachers who tell you the BENEFITS of each pose.
I had a small pounding headache before starting, tried Sara Ivanhoe & felt even more irritated & put in this though I know it's a bit advanced for me & felt calm for the first time in a day or so & my headache disappeared after doing the shoulder stand.

She starts with crescent pose 3x each side by standing & then sliding one foot backwards & then getting up all w/o hands, then warrior 1 (she helped me feel it more deeply w/deeper back bend), eagle, crow/2 hand snake pose w/dan tien breathing (does 2x, too advanced for me, need more upper body strength), cobra (she helped me do it more relaxed & deeper), knee to ear shoulder stand (1 leg shoulder stand the other leg looks like deep plow at same time), arching legs lift (locust w/legs high as possible & arms also raised above the waist, advanced), lying split legs (her legs were by her ears, does several times before holding), gate latch pose (simple side torso bend w/1 knee & 1 leg stretched to side), rocking horse/boat, wheel, knee to chest easy stretch, bowing pose (looks like deep child's pose almost upside down locust), several attempts & full headstand w/ & w/o a wall, reaching for the sky (simple upward arm stretch), dan tien breathing & also relaxation for 5 min & ends with light light/relaxing 4 min singing w/pretty video images.

You can see 3 clips from her series on youtube looking up her name.",1187308800,,1724,4.4525316455696204
7954076,5,B00005U2ER,"I really enjoy being guided through a strengthening class.  As a yoga instructor and ever learning student the ""Fun Challenge"" series helped me open my body up; gradually I am able to have a free flow of energy through my spine.  Wailana's teaching style is easy to follow and doesn't  put strain on me.  The Upside Down video gives me a broader knowledge on different ways of getting in and out of inversions.  This tape is great and certainly a fun challenge.",1073865600,,461,4.573170731707317
