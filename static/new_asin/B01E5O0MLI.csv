8757708,4,B01E5O0MLI,"A very rare british film circa 71 or 72 starring cult musician singer songwriter Roy Harper and Carol White in a story about a young mother looking for love and being pulled by both sides by a  priest and a carefree songwriter on the rise to fame who seem to be competing for her soul with their very different philosophies .. It is loosely based on a play that was influenced by the beatles classic .. ""eleanor rigby""...  its a time capsule but many of the themes remain universal to this day and the film holds up pretty well.. the dvd transfer is excellent as is the sound ... Harper plays a character much like himself named Mike Preston who briefly falls for the young mother Valerie...  for those who don't know him Harper  is a extremely talented 60s and 70s era songwriter who toured with Zeppelin - sang on pink floyd's albums and is a renowned singer songwriter himself... in Made he is on the cusp of stardom when he meets Valerie who is being wooed by many admirers including a priest who cant hide his emotions for her despite acting as if he is just there for spiritual guidance and help... the film addresses tragedy .. the working class... love ... betrayal.. and the sprit of the times... in the end it was a pretty entertaining and the songs and performances by Harper are extraordinary and he does a fine job acting as well ! In fact all the acting is strong and the movie holds up well!
If you can find it its worth a purchase ... being a Harper fan I was surprised to find such a rare piece of his life caught on the big screen and I am glad I took the time to seek this out!!!",1489708800,,1598,4.264026402640264
