8537491,1,B0097NYRWI,The disc could not be played on either of my two blu ray dvd players. The screen on the tv says the disc cannot be played in this region which means they probably sent me a europe format or the disc is bad.,1472428800,,206,3.813953488372093
8537492,1,B0097NYRWI,"U would think that the supplier would tell u that this DVD won`t play in your area  the entire U.S.A.  the first i ever herd of area 1 and area 2 .  I`v even forgotten what area i`m in now.  and very,  very few of my friends ever herd of area 1&2  actually none of them have.  So i might as well have thrown my money out the window.  $ 46.69 .  I did not know how to remity the problem at the

time.  By the time i figured out how. It was to late for an exchange, or a return.  The really should have informed me about the different areas  BIG LOSS  THANKS FOR NOTHING.",1402617600,,569,3.793103448275862
8537493,3,B0097NYRWI,"Good Sound and video.
Dont expect much of a stage show, just good Musicians doing what they do best.

8537494,5,B0097NYRWI,"I waited for a long time this BD, but did not know who had sent from Europe. I am very happy with my purchase.",1357689600,,110,3.625
8537495,5,B0097NYRWI,"Awesome disc & representation, this offering is rather superb indeed, but perhaps not for you.... but entirely so for me",1356566400,,120,5.05
8537496,5,B0097NYRWI,"Supertramp is a classic band. Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson are masters in both piano and vocals. John Helliwell a giant in percussion, sax and as a frontman. Bob Siebenberg (or ""C. Benberg"" as might be seen sometimes) the man playing the drums. At last, but not least, Dougie Thomson perfect with the bass.

When you put these 5 fellows together in a stage, you can be sure that something very good is about to happen. Should you increase the sound quality of the show, which is the case here, you can expect nothing but having a great time.

The only tiny negative point here is a few songs that were not recorded in video (of course you know it before buying due to a huge disclaimer on the back, but all missing songs can be found in the extras). On the other hand, other huge classics, such as Goodbye Stranger and Give a Little Bit, that were not in the original CD, can be found in this Blu-Ray.

Strongly recommended.",1350864000,3,925,4.39766081871345
8537497,1,B0097NYRWI,"This DVD is faulty. Someone put it in the market, without regarding the laws and the respect of the songwriters.  There are five playing, but only two of them wrote the songs for the band (by the way, they sing their own songs). And this two, didn t autorized this edition.
They are the founders os Supertramp: Rick Davies (he is retired and really don t care about this), and ROGER HODGSON who wrote the biggest hits of the band, and is touring around the world.",1346630400,3,463,4.383720930232558
