5460501,3,B00ANJNFCI,"I had high hopes when I found this for my two year old's Easter basket, and while it is a okay movie, it is not nearly as cute as the Curious George 2 movie, which we absolutely love.  From the opening scene, I could tell that this movie was not going to be a favorite, despite our passionate love of the tv show, books, and other movies. It has the feel of the tv series, having an educational tone and a strong presence of all the characters we know, and length of a short movie being just about an hour long.  Even though it is short, both my 2 and 7 year old have walked away from this one several times now.  I was really shocked since they will watch even horrible movies till the end!  The pace is slow, so even though it is a short movie, I think it fails to keep your attention.  The music is only mildly entertaining, although the best part of the movie is the ""wiener dog"" song and sequence which is pretty cute and funny.  My kids usually laugh out loud at the Curious George show and especially the 2nd movie, but this one barely brings out any emotion from them, which really surprised me. Watching my kids giggle and laugh is one reason why I love Curious George!
Overall, there are certainly worse children's movies out there.  After all, this is Curious George, so that alone is worth the three stars that I am giving it.  But compared to the other George programming it just doesn't hold up.  The spring theme is well timed and was a great idea, I just felt like it was a rushed, undeveloped production that was simply cashing in on the popularity of this beloved character.  Maybe your family will react differently, but for us, I can tell that this one will barely be played, and was not worth the 15 bucks I spent on it.  They just played it this morning on PBS, so I suggest you try and catch it there instead of purchasing it.",1366588800,,1849,4.2542857142857144
5460502,5,B00ANJNFCI,Another great movie!!!  My pre-schooler loves it (so do his teen brothers!) This little monkey sure know how to have fun!,1365033600,,121,4.761904761904762
5460503,5,B00ANJNFCI,"The sun is shining, the birds are chirping and it feels like spring already! What a perfect time to watch Curious George: Swings into Spring. I have adored Curious George since I was a child. I had all his books and a stuffed George was one of my most prized possessions. I did not, however, have the good fortune of watching him on a show so I might have been more excited then my kids to watch this!

Curious George is such a fun little monkey and his curiousity is always getting him into trouble. Thank goodness for his friend in the yellow hat who always manages to come to his rescue. My daughter Paige actually reminds me of Curious George so it makes sense she's the one that asks me to keep playing it over and over again!

Curious George and his buddy Hundley the dog are experience spring in different ways. Hundley is a guard dog at their building and spring means annoying rain and lots of dirt. George helps him to see the joys of spring. I love that this showed my kids that there is a positive spin on every negative and to always look for the sunshine behind the rain.

George as an animated character was exactly as I imagined he would be, right down to his monkey noises. The man in the yellow hat has a voice to suit his face and the bright colors are cheerful and appropriate for such a love-able character.

Sometimes while watching these shows, I realize I've never really discussed something with my kids, in this instance the changing of seasons. They know what season it is at the time but we have never really gone into the different seasons and how and when they change. So this movie became quite educational for us too.

At just under an hour this movie was the perfect length for my three and five year old's attention spans. I loved Curious George Swings Into Spring and it's fun lessons and introduction into the coming spring. Oh yea, and my kids loved it too!",1363132800,7,1894,4.384615384615385

5460537,3,B00ANJNFCI,"We are watching a good amount of curious George for dialogs (which helps my untraditional late talker preschooler grasp concept)... Sadly that movie has long time of animal dialog or musical parts.... I was also a little sad there was no mention of easter eggs, Easter Bunny or what have you (we bought it right before Easter).... Probably some kind of politically correct non religious choice on the producers part.
That said, the movie has some entertaining concepts for the little ones (hot air balloon, spring cleaning, spring fever).",1428537600,,538,5.056179775280899

5460544,2,B00ANJNFCI,"We saw this after seeing the Christmas special, which was very good.  This was slow-paced, super predictable and lacking in the special-ness of some other curious George shows.  The story seems forced and un-natural (even within the absurdity of the premise of the show.).  My biggest sign that it wasn't anything special is my four year old has no desire to watch it again.  He asks for other episodes and the Christmas special all the time.  Your mileage may vary.",1425081600,,466,4.775

5460553,5,B00ANJNFCI,My two year old grandson loves GG or Curious George to the rest of us.  This was an enchanting movie about spring with George coming to the rescue as usual - he's a genius!  I must say that when an adult can enjoy these movies as much as a two year old that says something about the quality of the writing and of course the art that goes into it.,1411603200,,346,3.9285714285714284

5460559,3,B00ANJNFCI,"It's more like a movie length episode of the TV show. It's not that it's bad, it's just that this shouldn't be listed alongside of the two feature films, nor should it cost the same amount of money as purchasing one of those films.",1385078400,,231,4.2727272727272725

5460563,4,B00ANJNFCI,"This is the PBS Spring Special that ran over the air. Since nobody owns their DVR, I bought a permanent copy for my grandson. Good quality as always from Universal Video. The Amazon Marketplace seller advertised it as ""new"". It was used with minor smudges that did not affect it. (It played o.k.) However, it was NOT NEW. Shrink wrap can be deceiving, can't it? I won't buy from ""CargoLargo"" again. The inside wrap still had the ""ToysRUs"" sticker. My best Marketplace seller has been ""MovieMars"". Their products I will recommend and I have bought several DVD's from them. All appeared to be new as advertised.",1376697600,,609,4.754716981132075
