8016105,5,B0001PFXXS,I love Richard Simmons and he has helped me throughout my life with exercise. Just love this man and his sensitivity towards people. Love you Richard!,1386633600,,150,4.8076923076923075
8016106,3,B0001PFXXS,"Well, what can I say? I never tried his workouts before and I thought it might be fun! I love the songs: Run around Sue, Stand by me, Reach out/I'll be there, When a man loves a women, Same old Song & Under the Boardwalk. It wasn't a waste of time as he did normal lower body exercises: squats, lunges and leg lifts etc. Yes, it was silly but it was fun and I worked out my legs & butt! Doing silly workouts once in a while just makes it fun!",1342051200,,442,3.868131868131868
8016107,4,B0001PFXXS,"I always did like Richard Simmons, so I really enjoyed this tape of exercises.  He is energetic and makes exercising fun.",1225065600,,121,4.761904761904762
8016108,5,B0001PFXXS,"This is a great leg and lower body workout.  In this workout, he uses the Richard Simmon's Tonin' Rings.  It is around thirty eight minutes and features the songs: ""Run Around Sue"", ""Stand By Me"", ""Reach Out,I'll Be There"", ""When A Man Loves A Woman"", ""Same Old Song"" and ""Under The Boardwalk"".  I enjoy this tape and his other tapes, even though I did not care for the Sweatin To The Oldies' series.  Like some of his other tapes, he uses more regular exercise steps, while still being fun, encouraging and motivating.  This and his other older tapes remind me why I love Richard Simmons so much!  He is an awesome motivator!  Just wish these were on dvd; although the vhs tapes do run cheaper.  I still remember Richard Simmons when he came on the t.v. to get us to exercise.  These are great workouts, while still being timeless.  They are not corny and make you feel uplifted as you exercise!",1201737600,,896,4.509316770186335
8016109,5,B0001PFXXS,"This is a great video for those with weak legs. My lower body is extremely weak and Richard works them just enough so I'm not in pain. I'm starting to use this video with ankle weights, because I'm starting to actually get some strength in my legs. This workout is a perfect length for me (just 25 minutes), so I'm not screaming in pain by the time it's over. I find this (and other Richard Simmons videos) very under-rated. He's a great instructor and this is a great video. His ""Uptown Toning"" which works upper body, is a great video too.",1120694400,4,541,4.366336633663367
