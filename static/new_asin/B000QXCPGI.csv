The one they gave my son years ago was misplaced and we thought we'd never be able to replace it.  We so appreciate Mike Cerre, his kindness and concern to those he served while filming this was outstanding!  He was our little ray of hope during the war as we eagerly waited for his semi-weekly updates.  Thank You!",1490486400,,427,4.2875
