4320633,3,B004BVAOBE,I wish I had known about what region 2 & 4 met before buying it. I have one dvd player which I can play the dvd on. Other than that the sound and picture are ok.,1359072000,,161,3.5
4320634,3,B004BVAOBE,"As I said in another review, I grew up with these shows and I loved them, then. I had forgotten how very corny this movie was, until I watched it today. Yuck! Of the three tv renuion movies made, this is the 2nd to worst preceeded by The Return of the Six Million dollar Man and Bionic Woman. The problem with this movie, as its predecessor is that the focus is not on Stveve and Jaime, but on the new Bionic Girl, an early role portrayed by Sandra Bullock. .
I had taped this off tv when it had originally aired. Would I recommend someone buying it, only if you are a die-hard fan. Otherwise, don't waste your money. It is corny, predictable and slow moving. There are also too many questions raised without answers.",1345075200,5,717,4.318518518518519

4320637,4,B004BVAOBE,"These movies were ok. Nice to see Steve Austin and Jaime Summers back in action. And to have them reunite and fall in love again was nice. The third movie was what fans of the original shows wanted for years-Steve and Jaime to get married. Nice sendoff for two great Sci-Fi characters. One more thing-THESE WILL NOT PLAY IN A NORMAL UNITED STATES DVD PLAYER!!!! We are Region 1 DVDs, these play in Regions 2 and 4. You need a REGION FREE DVD PLAYER in the US to play them. Or you are good with a computer....",1442275200,3,508,4.247422680412371

8422430,5,B004BVAOBE,"Sandra Bullock stars along with the classic stars from the original series with Wagner and Majors. Bionics have now advanced and the newer ""models"" are even faster. Sandra plays the role of a young woman who needs bionics to live and is chosen by the government to recieve them for one price:she must become a covert superspy for the U.S. government! She gains the super speed, super strength, and other abilities that Austin and Summers had and still have in this movie. If you are or were a fan of the classic 1970's Bionic craze, this is very good movie making with all the super fights and super running speed you remember. You might recognize the villain in this movie as well. He is no stranger to fantasy/fiction.",1491782400,,720,4.6328125
