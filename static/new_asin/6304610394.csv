908139,4,6304610394,"I will only grant that Simitar did something half right with the release of The Thin Red Line since they didn't bother to letterbox it.  That aside, the pan and scan transfer is done rather well, keeping up with the activity  onscreen.  The disappointment over the lack of widescreen is also mitigated  somewhat by the extras on this DVD.  They include a trailer, brief bios and  abridged filmography of Jack Warden and Keir Dullea, info on  Guadalcanal(geography, history. etc.), and documentary footage of Marines  fighting on Guam and Tarawa, but I don't recall seeing any on  Guadalcanal(contrary to the jacket description).  BTW, the audio is Dolby  Digital 2.0, not PCM.  Given the tendency of sixties war films towards  wider and louder spectacles, I think this low-budget film is vastly  underrated.  It certainly is ""serious-minded but flawed"" as the  Amazon reviewer noted, but I believe it succeeds more than it fails in  bringing to life the conflicts in Jones' novel.  This is thanks mostly to  the capable performances of not only Warden and Dullea, but also Ray Daley  and James Philbrook, who played Captain Stone and Colonel Tall.  Interestingly enough, James Jones wrote director Andrew Marton and  commented on ""how marvelous I thought were the combat scenes in the  film.""  Spain may not be Guadalcanal, but the black-and- white  photography obscures that.  I'll leave debates of accuracy to those who  have actually seen Guadalcanal. Followers of spaghetti westerns will  recognize the terrain pretty quickly though.",943228800,12,1537,5.188524590163935
908140,2,6304610394,"The question asked routinely of today's  movies is ""How did they do that?"" In the case of the original Thin Red Line movie it is ""Why did they do that?""
Why take a powerful and compelling literary work  and create from it a film that would be a perfect choice for the Tuesday  Night Movie on network TV in the mid sixties, complete with an irritatingly  uninspired musical score that sounds like it was pilfered from a daytime  soap opera?
The more recent Malick production of the James Jones novel  is far more compelling, visually interesting, better directed and better  acted; almost to the point of embarassment.
The novel, as written, is  strongly character driven. It was the way Jones worked and was a large  element of his painfully honest writing, the resulting work having a  timeless quality.  The action is complex and it makes for an intiguing  challenge to interpret this work into a film.
Reading The Thin Red Line  makes me want to see it in movie form but I also see a problem in how to  film it and keep faith with the author at the same time: the age old  Hollywood dilemma, How do we make an honest picture and at the same time  please the audience?  Malick took on that challenge with Thin Red Line and  came off pretty well for it notwithstanding some disagreeability among  critics on parts of the story that are difficult to exploit cinematically.  This sixties black and white version, however, betrays a virtual phobia of  candid and forthright story interpretation. The idea seems to have been to  exploit the novel without disturbing the audience. If these people told the  story of Noah, they would have left out all the nasty stuff about the flood  and all that annoying rain.  In the end it seems not to have mattered. They  accomplished their aim: To make yet another fine book into a trite and  uninteresting film.",923270400,3,1848,4.6234567901234565
908445,3,6304610394,"The film originally opened with Sam Fuller's The Naked Kiss, and thinking of those film son a double bill, both mixing sex with violence, makes one miss the era when two films could be seen for a single ticket. In fact, while Malick's film never explicitly reveals what the film's title means, Marton's film wastes little time in explaining, via Captain Stone, that the phrase is from an old Midwest saying, `There's only a thin red line between sanity and madness.' The DVD, by Simitar Entertainment, has some interesting extras, such as bios on Dullea and Warden, but also six clips from genuine World War Two documentaries- the most interesting being a clip on the rescue of an American who evaded capture for 31 months, after the Japanese originally invaded Guam. That soldier, named George Tweed, had his tale told  in a 1962 film, starring Jeffrey Hunter, called No Man Is An Island. There is also the original theatrical trailer, and a series of clickable features that has important historical facts about the Battle of Guadalcanal. There is no audio commentary track.

  Overall, the DVD package is a solid one, but the film is merely mediocre, albeit with some good moments. It is best watched as a curio piece (especially for fans of Dullea's career), and a companion to the infinitely superior Terrence Malick film of 1998. That film is one of the more sublime expressions of cinema in American history. This film is a `flick.' But flicks have their place, and this one's will be next to its cousin. Insert any `strange bedfellows' comment at your leisure.",1340236800,,1568,4.83955223880597

908449,2,6304610394,"I thought I remembered this as being a good movie when I was a kid. Upon seeing this movie again, some thirty-five years later; I was wrong. The acting is terrible and the story has more than a few technical flaws that really irked me. Such as the soldiers with no grenandes hanging from their web gear (they magically appear during the battle scenes), or only one BAR in the entire company, and no one wearing bandoleers of ammo for their M-1 rifles. And one of the biggest faux's was the use of German MP-40's (9mm subguns) by both the Americans and Japanese (In the Pacific War?).

A cheaply made movie (technically speaking) for only the psychological impact. I guess I'm just used to more realism than was displayed in this movie. If you've ever seen bad acting when a soldier is getting shot - a la ""Hell Is For Heroes,"" then you're really going to laugh at the way guys die in this movie. Ugh! I'm donating my video to the local library.",1152921600,2,944,4.425287356321839
908450,4,6304610394,"This was a film that was not affraid to be controversial.  While not a great work, it was typical of war films being made about WW2 in the late 50s, early 60s.  Some of these films were not affraid to look at the more gritty, nasty aspects of combat.  It is significant in a lot of these films the strain often shown between commanding officers and their men.  In this case the blood and guts quality of the CO versus his subordinate.  The US army of the time often didn't have much time for sentimentality.  Films like this were willing to show that.

The combat scenes are intense for their time, but not overly graphic. Its interesting that the army is portrayed here instead of the Marines.  Most Pacific war flicks usually portray the Marines versus the Japs.  Here we see what the army often had to do after the Marines moved on to another island.

This is a hard hitting film for its time, with little real plot other than the strains and stresses of combat on the various characters.  The 1998 re-make was probably a more vague and poetic film.  Certainly its scenery is much more vivid than what you get here. Its also a lot slower moving! The music is a tense score from English composer Malcom Arnold whose work is evident in many films of this period.  This is your classic B&W war film for the time it was made in.  Take it or leave it!",1152748800,2,1349,4.344
908451,2,6304610394,"The Thin Red Line (Andrew Marton, 1964)
Andrew Marton (King Solomon's Mines, The Longest Day) took on James Jones' best, and biggest, novel some thirty-four years before Terence Malick did. After the desecration Malick released, I resolved I had to see Marton's version as soon as I could, because surely, nothing could possibly be worse than Malick's. I was right... but not by much.
Marton focused on some different points in The Thin Red Line than Malick did (including, surprisingly, a glancing reference towards the book's homosexual themes), but in the end, there's still way too much missing for this to be a good adaptation of Jones' gorgeous, sprawling novel of the Battle of Guadalcanal. Marton focuses, as any decent adaptation would have, on the conflict between Private Doll (Keir Dullea of 2001: A Space Odyssey) and Sergeant Welsh (the omnipresent Jack Warden). Someone, however, should have mentioned to screenwriter Bernard Morton (Earth vs. the Flying Saucers... nuff said) that when you're already desperately trying to concatenate a six-hundred-page (in eight-point font) novel into just over an hour and a half, you don't write in extra confrontations between the two main characters or you lose sight of the rest of the novel (in this case, well, the four days of battle of Guadalcanal, which get about ten minutes of screen time). And yet still, in a film an hour shorter than Malick's, Marton managed to squeeze in the whole book rather than just the first half. Astounding.
Dullea, never the best of actors, well earned Noel Coward's ""Keir Dullea, gone tomorrow"" jibe. There were some directors, Kubrick among them, who were capable of turning Dullea's oddly featureless face to their advantage. Marton is one of them. Dullea, by virtue of his complete indistinguishability from your basic eighteen-year-old American preppy, becomes a sort of everyman, while the easily-recognizable Warden is a character all to himself. (Jones fans, take note: one of the movie's true weaknesses is that it explores Welsh's ""property"" ideas even less than does Malick's movie.) This in itself creates an additional tension in the movie, which in some places it sorely needs. But in the end, both Marton's and Malick's attempts to being The Thin Red Line to the screen both failed for the same reason: the  source material won't stand for it. Far too much of the book is internalized and doesn't translate well to the screen, leading to isolated dramatic scenes (needless to say, Marton and Malick focused on many of the same points of high drama offered in the novel) in seas of slow, uninteresting sitting in the jungle and waiting.
Still, if you were as disgusted by Malick's heretical retelling as I was, this is worth a rental. It's not the movie it should have been (when someone finally does he Thin Red Line correctly, it will, deservedly, be as lauded as was From Here to Eternity), but it's a step farther in the right direction than Malick got. **",1054857600,9,2966,4.979838709677419

908453,5,6304610394,"I worked on this film in 1966 as camera operator for Director of photogrphy Manuel Berenguer ASC. Mr. Berenguer got an Oscar nomination for the best B/W foreing film. Been aware of the difficulties we went through in  the actual filming, for which the audience is oviously not aware, and seen  the final result on the screen, I'm convinced that this version from Marton  is far better than the last version.

908454,3,6304610394,"Personally, I like this film better than the more recent remake.  Very strong performances especially by key actors Warden and Dullea.  I do have a problem, however, with the overall quality of the film as transferred to  the DVD format.  Sound quality is very poor (there are times when you can  barely hear the dialogue over the background hiss) and visuals are likewise  spotty.  This could have used a little bit of ""cleaning up"",  although I'm really not sure if this is possible given the age and relative  obscurity (hence probably not properly taken cared of) of the film.  This  should just have been released in cheaper formats (e.g. MPEG-1 / VCD or  VHS) due to the very minimal (if any at all) ""added value"" in  terms of audio/video quality in DVD format.  I hope they eventually come  out with a better, cleaner version for DVD though.",944438400,4,848,4.673469387755102
