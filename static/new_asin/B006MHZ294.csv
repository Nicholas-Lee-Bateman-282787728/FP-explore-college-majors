8500801,1,B006MHZ294,"I was really disappointed when I got this & set down with the family to watch only to see it was a set of plays. We decided to give it a chance but the whole thing was just generic & poorly done. The cover gives the impression it's a movie made from Grimms fairy tales, far from it. I was able to give it to someone who would enjoy it so all is not lost.",1436054400,,354,3.7333333333333334

8500806,1,B006MHZ294,"This is nothing like the cover depicts it will be.
Creepy? Definitely Not, more like STUPID!
These are Fairy Tale Theater screenplays that I used to watch back when I was under the age of 10.
The only funny thing was seeing actors back in the day or are big names now.
Still, Don't waste your money!",1349136000,10,299,4.2631578947368425
8500807,3,B006MHZ294,"The case makes it look scary and gruesome, but they're cute little fairy tales. They're not ANYTHING like the case. They're for children. They're cute stories, but the case makes it look scary. Failure.",1346371200,10,202,4.970588235294118
