3903018,5,B002C39T28,"In movies that I have seen Jeff Goldblum in I never thought of him much more than a fly on the set, but he is really, and I mean really, good in this movie. In fact he gives an Oscar caliber performance.

My knees buckle when comedy's scrupulously interjected into the midst of extreme tragedy of the Holocaust scale. Last time I've seen a movie like this was Roberto Benigni's Life Is Beautiful.

Goldblum's character, Adam Stein, was a very successful comedy producer in Berlin in the 1930's. He owned a theater that even Nazis frequented to enjoy their time there. Although he saw the dark side of the Nazi regime as early as 1936, when a bunch of Nazi soldiers entered backstage and killed his show bear, he did not take his family and leave Germany. Fast forward to 1944, he and his family are seen in a train, which is on its way to a concentration camp. Fast forward to 1960s, he is now in an Israeli institute in the middle of a desert specifically designed to rehabilitate concentration camp survivors.

Stein's story is getting back on life's track.",1262304000,4,1059,4.534031413612565

3903020,5,B002C39T28,"Although the story was disturbing, the performance by Mr. Goldblum was nothing short of amazing.  Not since ""One flew over the Cuckoos nest"" has the fine line between sanity and otherwise been so artfully performed.",1255824000,,215,5.142857142857143
3903021,2,B002C39T28,"This is the kind of artsy film you watched in English class and broke up into small groups and discussed for 2 weeks.

3903022,2,B002C39T28,"Adam Stein (Jeff Goldblum) was the most celebrated clown in Germany. While in a concentration camp, a Nazi officer (William Defoe) decided to keep Adam for his own personal entertainment having him spend more than a year as his dog. Years after the war, Adam is in an institution for survivors of the Holocaust. One day he finds a young patient that believes he is dog.

 It was told from the year 1961 and had flash backs over a period of twenty years. The flash backs to the concentration camps while, I'm sure were meant to be very moving could have been clips from just about WWII movie. I don't know if the emotion was left out of the writing or the acting, but scenes of this nature are inherently affecting. The only one that came close to being poignant was where Adam lost his family.

The `present' story was unbelievable; perhaps not so much the story, as the actions of most of the characters. Goldblum does an amazing job of acting, and there is no way to predict the psychological effects of everything his character endured. Also, with an asylum there is lots of room for varied and unusual personalities. One character that I think is amazing is that of ""Wolfie"". The problem I have is that almost all the doctors and staff cede authority to Adam. They let him have free run of the facility and organization of it. It seems as if he runs it, instead of the doctors. Don't even start me on what is wrong with the head nurse, who should be a patient herself instead of in charge of them. I found it very hard to believe that any type of facility would have a staff that would let the patients run the place. To add to the improbability of the movie the young boy makes this huge amazing break through just because Adam comes into his life.

I was really excited when I saw the trailer for this movie. It looked unbelievably moving, and the reviews were really strong. Then watching it, it fell really flat. I think the biggest problem this movie had was that it tried to tackle too much, and ended up skimming the surface of what would be several powerful possibilities for a movie. While it shows Adam interacting with the boy there is little focus on the bond that he could have formed with the boy and how he helps him. It spends a great part of the movie showing Adam spontaneously wounding himself with no physical explanation (internal bleeding, other forms of bleeding and wounds with no cause or explanation) that take movie time and are not explained in the movie. Maybe the DVD extras explain, but I wasn't interested enough to find out. I would have liked to see more of an attempt to explain or help the viewer understand Adam. The one scene that I felt really gave an insight was when he went to his daughter's grave. And the clips in the mental hospital are I believe meant to be dark humor, but just don't quite ring true. I already mentioned the shallow emotional depth of the camp flashbacks.

To sum it up, the movie was a disappointment. It looked like it would be a heartrending drama about a recovering Holocaust survivor. One who had been tortured in a most unusual way, because he had the unique ability to impersonate animals. This same survivor would latter find redemption and renovation in an institution years later by helping cure a young boy. In reality, it was a hot mess with some high and very low points in acting. It focused more on the randomness that was Adam's life and left the viewer feeling wanting.",1255305600,5,3454,4.48489666136725
3903023,3,B002C39T28,"A former circus clown who was spared the gas chamber so that he might entertain thousands of other Jews as they marched to their deaths. He also to save his own life has to act like a dog bark and crawl around in a camp officals office to entertain him.

Adam is now at an asylum populated solely by Holocaust survivors extremely popular with inmates and one nurse especially. Adam IQ makes him more brilliant than the doctors and more insane than any of the patients.

I read and watch many stories on the death camps. But this story has something missing.  It's an average dvd only.  But don't get me wrong  Jess Goldblum and William Dafoe did brilliant acting rolls.  Maybe it was the changing from a book to a movie that ruined it I just don't know. I have given 5 stars to other death camp stories so don't think I was turned off by the theme, there is just something missing in the storyline.",1254528000,3,898,4.347305389221557

3903025,5,B002C39T28,"This masterpiece by Paul Schrader (who is not Jewish, but Pennsylvania-Dutch in origin, though you would not
know it from this work of art) is subliminal and heartbreaking on so many levels.  I won't say this is
Jeff Goldblum's best performance because he has had several poor peformances; thus, it is impossible to
compare his phenomenal metaphysical psychotic discourse in this film to all his other mundane (whether
good or not so good) performances. The rest of the cast is stellar. The young boy ('dog') in the film
is heartbreaking.  This film is not for the lighthearted or the impatient, nor is it for those seeking
easy answers or quik Hollywood cliches and fixes as it provides none. This film is wretched and
beautiful, painful and sublime and corroborates (though I doubt it needed confirmation) Paul Schrader
as a masterful Director and artist for the thinking adult and the scared child within. The anticipated
Academy Award's avoidance of this film is the degree of measure by which to judge its artistry and
profoundity. If you could imagine a collaboration by Luis Bunuel, Federico Fellini, Joel and Ethan Coen
and David Cronenberg, it would like something like this, and that is NO small compliment to Schrader
and what he has done here.",1254096000,22,1255,4.943127962085308
3903026,5,B002C39T28,"I had to wait a few days in writing this review as I wanted to try and figure out everything I just saw, plus the special features take some patience.

Jeff Goldblum plays a death camp survivor that has been committed to an asylum (years after the war) for survivors in Israel. Willem Dafoe plays the Nazi officer who tortures him, with some excellent supporting performances by Ayelet Zurer and Derek Jacobi. The story spans 40 years and is told in a non-lineal format crossing between black and white and color. The Blu clarity is outstanding at times, grainy in others but those scenes are made to be that way, otherwise the entire production has a high budget feel but simple at the same time. The DTS is used very well, and gets utilized in ways one would not expect from a Holocaust film (the cabaret scenes, the echoing barks in the asylum halls, the narration, etc.). The special features are a long watch and include:
* Behind the scenes, 24 minutes: A thorough interview/film splice featurette that covers the entire production and the minds behind the film, if you have only a little time to watch everything this would be the extra to see.
* Deleted scenes, 9:30 minutes: The last half of these are more of a cutting room floor add-on and are dry. The only scene worth checking is the first one as it adds a whole other dynamic between Dafoe/Goldblum (post holocaust) that is never alluded to in the film.
* Haifa Film Festival Q&A, 72 minutes: Catered to the hardcore film fans that can sit through a hour+ of ESL participants, bad sound and garbled speeches. I tried to understand what was being said but it gets tedious, still some great inspiration and production info, but the making of covers it better.

By far, Goldblum's best performance to date - a pinnacle in his career. The imagery and disturbing asylum elements make for a difficult watch. I cannot be sure how to recommend this other than to say be prepared for an unusual character film on a solid BD. Region coded A, lasts 96 minutes and is a hard R for every theme listed.",1253664000,14,2052,4.558265582655826

Even the partial restoration of some these has little meaning after visiting hell on earth.

3903067,5,B002C39T28,"Urban legend:  a tourist walking through the Louvre turned to a guard and remarked: ""These paintings don't seem to be so special!""  The guard replied: ""Madam, the quality of these paintings is not in question.  The quality of your opinion is.""
Ah.  There's the rub.  Here we are, `rating' a work of art.  What do we rate it for?  Its emotional impact?  The unfolding of a plot line?  The pacing?  The acting?  Fine.  Those things can count.  But there isn't sadly, a single review on this page which wrestles with this film.  This troubles me for many reasons.

Let's just ask: why would a man who graduated from the premier Dutch Reformed college in America make a move about the Holocaust?  To upstage Spielberg?  Give me a break.  Here is man who understands that Hitler's death camps are the death knell to any rationalized belief in the God of Mount Sinai.  Jew, Christian, and Muslin alike have failed to grapple with this in a variety of ways.

The title of the movie is our first clue.  ""Resurrected""  Resurrection in  movie about Jews?  The Chutzpah is so deep here, right?  Wrong.  Adam flatlines while trying to save the boy.  I haven't seen a single reference to the thick symbolism in so much of this film.  Not a wasted word or camera angle.  The scene in the desert where Adam demands that God show himself, to be answered by a flame is the most brilliant restatement of the Moses story I can imagine: to have his tormentor appear out of it, raises the stakes and to have him remove the God of Sinai by tossing the gun into the flames is pure genius.

Yes.  I get the crack about needing Cliff Notes.  A lot of folks will need so much more than the Cliff Notes for this one.  American religious and cultural ignorance is of a piece with our studied indifference to the world in which we live now.  Our artists are so often reduced to babbling incoherently because our vocabulary is so impoverished.  So we just settle for small talk about the emotional impact.  Am I feeling the love or not?

Adam is the second Adam.  The Adam who screams from  his cross: ""My God, why have you forsaken me?""

But if you are culturally (and that includes Biblically) illiterate, then you are blind and sitting at the temple of your soul begging for crusts of bread.  I'm hardly claiming that you need to be an Orthodox Jew or a church-going Christian to understand that the suffering of these survivors is riddled through with their loss of faith, that their extreme pain  is so much more than mere `survivors guilt'.

We can't make movies like this one or even ""High Noon"" any more.  No one `gets them' except on the most superficial of levels.  So we get a scattering of reviews, and a work of true genius averages out to what?  Three stars?

The miracle is that this movie ever saw the silver screen.  Pay attention.  It may be one of the last of its kind.",1332633600,5,2858,4.456310679611651
3903068,4,B002C39T28,"This is the story of Adam Stein (Jeff Goldblum), who was an entertainer, circus owner and cabaret artist in pre war Germany. He appears to have a sixth sense and special powers like mind reading, but chooses to use them for entertainment purposes, rather than any form of betterment. He is doing brilliantly until he is outed, as a Jew closed down and sent to a concentration camp. On arrival he is spotted by Commandant Klein (the always excellent Willem Dafoe). He has seen Adam perform and challenges him to entertain him and his dog.

After that episode he is kept and treated as a talking dog by Klein. His only respite being allowed to `entertain' fellow Jews on the way to the gas chambers - whilst his people burn, he plays the fiddle.

Years later in 1961he has been taken into an institution in Tel Aviv which caters for survivors of the Death Camps. It is run by a forward thinking doctor played by Derek Jakobi (Dr. Nathan Gross). He allows Adam a wide degree of latitude as he a genuine connection with his fellow patients (if that is the right word) and always has time to help them. Adam has been promised that no dog will ever be allowed onto the premises as the memories it could bring back are just too much. Then one day he hears a dog and that marks a change in everything.

This is a brilliantly acted and crafted film. Jeff Goldblum can often be a caricature of himself, however here he really puts in a great performance. The character of Adam is far from straight forward, apart from the physical side of the performance the emotional highs and lows would be a stretch for anyone. He pulls it off convincingly and with charm.

There are some painful scenes and some unusual ones, but this is actually done very tastefully. The past is told in flashback and filmed in black and white. It is expertly done and adds authenticity to the whole film. Whilst not always an easy watch it is full of screen moments that will have you feeling that you have missed something, sterling performances all round. If you are interested in the war and or great drama then this should be one that you would enjoy. Hard to compare to other films as this is dealing with the post traumatic effects, but it is a film that will undoubtedly stay with you.",1330560000,4,2256,4.468446601941747

3903071,5,B002C39T28,"ADAM  RESURRECTED is a strange, mesmerizing art film adapted from Yoram Kaniuk's novel 'Adam Ben Kelev' ('Man, Son of a Dog'), adapted for the screen by Noah Stollman, and brilliantly directed by Paul Schrader, whose contributions to the art of film include writing and/or directing such important works as 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull', 'Affliction', 'The Last Temptation of Christ', Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters', 'American Gigolo', etc.  It is another examination of the effects of the Holocaust of the survivors but with such a different twist and graced with some magnificent performances that it stands with the finest films that deal with this subject.

Adam Stein (Jeff Goldblum, in an astonishingly fine portrayal) prior to the beginnings of WW II was a highly successful Berlin impresario of a 'Circus' - a cabaret act where he performed acts of magic, comedy, playing the violin, mind reading, doing acts of dagger throwing with his daughter and wife in assistance - a comedian beloved by all his countrymen including the Nazis.  When the film opens we are in Tel Aviv in the year 1961 and the mentally disturbed Adam is an on again off again patient in an insane asylum for Holocaust victims, a center of continued 'experiments by a staff of physicians (headed by Dr. Gross - Derek Jacobi and an attendant bizarre nurse Gina - Ayelet Zurer, in love with Adam)  who are intimidated by the genius quality of Adam and his ability to keep the inmates happy.  In a series of flashbacks (in black and white) to 1926, 1932, and 1944 we see Adam in concentration camps, still entertaining his fellow Jews and asked to play his violin for the Jews who are being escorted into the ovens for cremation.  He is observed by Commandant Klein (Willem DaFoe) who had once been entertained by Adam's circus act and later with Adam  a prisoner in the concentration camp has Adam act like a dog for Klein's entertainment, a particularly painful duty when later, in the asylum in Israel Adam  discovers that Dr. Gross is keeping a young boy on a chain, treating him like a real dog. The relationship between man and dog and dog and dog and man and boy is complex and heartbreakingly somber.  The implications and plays within plays that fill this film demand the fell attention of the viewer.

Many of the numerous aspects that enhance Paul Schrader's expert telling of this strange story include Gabriel Yared's musical score (with a lot of help from Wagner's 'Tannhauser' and Schubert lieder as sung by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf), the brilliant costuming of actor Jeff Goldblum, and the many small roles in this film filled by some of Germany's and Israel's most gifted actors.  But towering over it all is the compelling performance by Jeff Goldblum who has created a character on film that once seen will never be forgotten.  Highly Recommended.

3903073,5,B002C39T28,"As the son of a Survivor of the Shoah, I have seen many films about the Holocaust and read many books, both documentary and fiction. I have rarely been so deeply affected as with ADAM, RESURRECTED, Jeff Goldblum's unknown tour-de-force performance. Goldblum plays the brilliant Adam. Before the War, Adam was a professional clown. During the War, he is sent to a Concentration Camp, where the Kommandant (Willem DaFoe) forces him to be his pet---literally. Adam must bark, he must beg, he must eat from a bowl on the floor. In return, Adam is scratched behind the ear, given dog treats, and allowed to live.

Adam survives the War in the Kommandant's villa, while outside, the Holocaust takes its terrible toll, consuming even Adam's family, whom the Kommandant refuses to spare. After the War, Adam emigrates to Israel where he is hospitalized in a special facility for psychiatrically disturbed Holocaust Survivors located in the isolation of the Negev Desert.

Much of ADAM, RESURRECTED addresses the mocking disdain that many Israelis felt for Survivors in the years just after the War. The general consensus in the 1950s and early 1960s was that the women survived as prostitutes; the men were presumed to have survived by collaborating. Knowing that his family has died, Adam is wracked with guilt. He occasionally falls into a deep, dark cruelty against his fellow patients. Adam faces mental abuse and emotional neglect at the hands of his new countrymen. The moment when some young children tell Adam to, ""Go back to Europe, you old soap,"" tears at the soul.

Adam's ""resurrection"" truly begins when he discovers a young boy, David, living under a bed in the hospital, lost, as Adam had been lost, in being a dog. It is Adam's halting attempts to bring young David back to life amongst humanity that resurrect him and allow him to face the horrors of his own past.

This is a disturbing, unrelievedly dark film that is an important addition to the canon of films about the Holocaust. Though it is painful to watch, this film needs to be seen and contemplated by anyone posessed of a human conscience and consciousness.",1294876800,7,2127,4.883656509695291

3903077,5,B002C39T28,"After a close friend ""insisted"" that I watch this film, I was absolutely torn apart by it, at times entertained by it and left with indelible images and feelings that may never leave me. It is a stunningly woven story of humanity at the peak of its potential for courage and resilience, as well as its unspeakable cruelty and taste for inflicting pain. I was startled, however, to discover that I was in the minority in my assessment. Most reviews, professional and otherwise, are either mixed or unfavorable. Is it too hard to take this film in? And if so, is it because of its intellectual or emotional demands - or both? As a psychologist and a Jew, let me say that I have never been made to feel the complex horrors of the holocaust on this level. Jeff Goldblum's performance is criminally unrecognized; it is the work of genius he has never before manifested. Perhaps the genius Goldblum found in the story itself, and in Paul Schrader's direction moved him to new heights. The rest of the cast is brilliant as well.

Adam Resurrected deals unflinchingly with the excruciating, bitterly ironic issues that Hitler's slaughterhouses have evoked in the area of faith and the Jewish attitude toward the God whose deliverance of their ancestors from slavery is celebrated year after year.  The ironies and metaphors throughout the film involving men and dogs say more than any words of praise could possibly express.

Suffice it to say that this is, in my humble opinion, one of the finest films of the last decade, and perhaps the best work of art on the holocaust of all time. It is demanding, complex and disturbing, but highly worth your time and attention.",1262390400,39,1661,4.740484429065744
8362953,5,B002C39T28,"Adam Resurrected is a captivating, bizarre, and at times extremely real and disturbing film.

While I do not want to spoil much about the film, please be warned that this film is NOT for everyone. The cinematography, editing, and pacing of the film and reflection on the main character Adam Stein (played brilliantly by Jeff Goldblum) make you feel a little bit disoriented and maybe even a little crazy, which is entirely the point of the movie. Some things are shown in the film that might be simply too preposterous or outrageous to believe, but the way the film is shot makes what is happening on screen feel very real.

This is the accomplishment of this film: it throws at you such bizarre and preposterous characters and actions, and then takes these actions and grounds them in reality and, most importantly, feeling: you really feel engrossed in the world being presented, and it can sometimes be very disorienting and disturbing to watch.

Paul Schrader's direction is spot on, and all the performances are quite good. The pacing and editing is also well-done with beautiful cinematography, although the film has a few editing and pacing quirks here and there where things could have been done better. All in all, though, it's an extremely well-made film.

Jeff Goldblum gives a heartbreaking and breathtaking performance, a true crime being committed that he has not been given more recognition for this film.

Watch this film if you are in any way a fan of Jeff Goldblum or cinema.",1524528000,,1493,4.862204724409449
8362954,3,B002C39T28,"Goldblum's best role ever. Plays the Holocaust survivor, and later remorseful drunk, brilliantly. The hospital in Israel was delightful, though ruined by his unrealistic affair with a nurse, and later the dog-boy. But the head shrinks had it right all along: let people help each other while we sit back and referee their madness. And that is exactly what happens. Wracked with guilt and suffering from what appears to be Bipolar disorder and elements of PTSD, Goldblum destroys the negative object in him and is led to a life of peace that he long sought. Great ending.
My only complaint with the film is that it uses the stale Nazi vs Jew plot device that has been done hundreds of times over already. But Dafoe's SS officer was not as tropey as you'd expect. He keeps his word, like a good German gentleman, and holds up his end of the bargain, effectively giving Goldblum the estate to which he himself had planned to escape to after the war. Perhaps he felt guilt over the way he treated Goldblum like a dog for so long, and new he had to face justice (the approaching Soviets). Either way, a beautiful story, hampered only by a few stereotypical elements that could have been done better.",1519603200,,1194,4.636792452830188

Had they seemed thoughtful or expressive rather than bitter, impatient, thoughtless, simplistic, childish even, I would consider their comments valuable. As it is, what a shame for them to so scathingly bring down a fine film deserving of five stars all 'round almost as acts of vengeance, or as if kicking something trashy off their shoes.

While I am ignorant of the Academy's inner workings, I am not of politics in general and politics must be what happened with this movie.  I cannot imagine any other reason since I have to believe they were left at just as much a loss for words as I was.  The silence must have been deafening in that viewing room.
  Jeff Goldblum's incising intellect, rapid fire analysis of his character's moments of clarity and descents into madness are etched into his face as well.  Masterful delivery.  I suspect Jeff Goldblum to have that mad scientist aura since he plays that sort of character in most of his films, and he is at his experienced best in this role.  Willem DaFoe is very believable as an SS commandant, and frighteningly so.  The ease and confidence of his delivery is as good on it's level as Jeff Goldblum's is on his.  The supporting cast is just as good on their level.
Very well done, very much worth watching, and the movie most likely to haunt your humanity.  If you are a thinker, or an understander or have known a survivor of any kind of ethnic holocaust, you will as much feel this film as see it.",1508112000,6,1232,4.475336322869955
