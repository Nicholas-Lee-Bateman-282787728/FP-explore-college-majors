4456091,5,B004QWSU46,"Without revealing any real spoilers I have to say...
I'm not much for the ""Chick Flick""/romance genre, but this movie wowed me.

Kate Hudson put in a performance of such quality, that I haven't seen from her since ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"". She starts out fun and flirty with a bit of despicable mixed in. Then her character moved me to a bit of hatred for the treatment she issued to her family and friends. Then towards the end she made me fall in love with her character and almost come to tears for her predicament.

There's a lot of teaching, learning and cameraderie throughout the movie. There are laughs shared and tears shed between the characters. Every single moment within the movie feels genuine, and I can genuinely see myself or anybody else going through the same phases if faced with a similar situation. I honestly wouldn't be surprised to find out that this was based on a true life story(don't remember seeing that stated anywhere in the movie though).

This movie has sufficient humor to be a comedy, sufficient grief to be a tragedy and just enough love to be a romance that doesn't make you nauseous. There is only one truly over the top moment in the movie, but it's at the end. The biggest tragedy is this movie will only be in limited release at a few theatres just weeks before the DVD comes out.",1333929600,84,1328,4.45679012345679
4456092,5,B004QWSU46,"If you are looking for a good combination of laughter and real life human drama with the spice of true love this is the movie.  A fenomenal cast, Gael Garcia is a perfect cast for it, his crying is so passionate and sincere.  Kate Hudson is a spectacular romatic gender actress.  It's a light and sensitive movie about what it takes to come to peace with yourself when your time is up.

Positively recommend it.",1324857600,26,411,4.44
4456093,1,B004QWSU46,Kate Hudson should Never Ever Ever play someone who has a serious problem. Never ever ever ever ever...  She's way too pampered and self-indulgent to be believable.  Great example: we don't want to be like that.,1500249600,,211,4.833333333333333

4456123,3,B004QWSU46,"Kate is great in lightweight rom-coms and usually has little to do except flash her girlish smile and flaunt her seductive charm and comedic timing.  Here she once again is the self-absorbed, bitchy party girl and total user of all her friends.  and family's good will.  She's done selfish before; check out ""Bride Wars"" or ""Something Borrowed"".  This is not a rom-com and the subject has been done better in better movies on coming to terms with death.

The pluses: Only Kate's performance
Hudson develops a character who goes from shallow to bitter to reflective and ultimately self-realized when she faces a terminal cancer diagnosis.  She does it well

The Annoyances:
Waste of the terrific Kathy Bates' talent as Kate's mom. Also, no one believes gorgeous Treat Williams was married to obese Bates....sorry Kathy.  You can act your a... off but obese women don't attract guys like Williams.
Gael Garcia Bernal as her doctor then lover was completely unconvincing as both.  First of all, he is a boyish,  tiny man physical chemistry was nil. He looked like a child next to Hudson. Bernal never displayed any emotion over Hudson's impending death and there was a creepy sense he was just taking advantage of doctor-patient sex. Bernal was bad casting.
Treat Williams played her estranged father but would have been better as the doctor and lover.
I could see him as the older figure who finally inspires Hudson to trust a relationship, and also someone who despairs at not saving her. Whoopi Goldberg is some sort of angel/God figure who adds nothing to the plot.
The lame final scene of the Mardi Gras-like funeral misses the mark. I give the director and script writers a low grade on this one but Kate Hudson gets an A for effort.",1452211200,,1736,4.814814814814815

4456177,5,B004QWSU46,"Kate Hudson can always be counted on to choose juicy roles, and this one is no exception. She plays Marley Corbett, a flirtatious, successful ad executive with an eclectic collection of devoted friends, who is not ready to settle down with any man. As we soon find out, she has ""commitment issues"" due to the acrimonious relationship between her divorced parents. Her father (Treat Williams) is distant and disconnected, and her mother (Kathy  Bates) is overbearing.

Marley is diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer by her shy, handsome doctor Julian Goldstein (played by Gael Garcia Bernal), and tries to keep the diagnosis from her boss, though her friends know what she is going through. During her sedation while having a colonoscopy, Whoopi Goldberg appears as an angelic tooth fairy, ready to grant her 3 wishes. She chooses $1 million, a chance to fly, and to find love. So, without spoiling the plot, you know she's going to get 3 wishes!

Though there are many humorous moments in the film, it is by no means a ""rom-com"". Kate Hudson portrays the full range of emotions here - from elation to sadness to remorse to grief, supported by a wonderful ensemble cast of accomplished actors. The setting in New Orleans is gorgeous - the street scenes, her apartment, her sister's home, restaurants, the nightclubs with jazz bands - each setting is carefully chosen and layered with furnishings, color and light.

""A Little Bit of Heaven"" is a very enjoyable film that meets all my criteria for entertainment - great actors, an interesting narrative, and a unique and beautiful setting.",1405382400,,1586,4.928838951310861

I thought this one was in that category but there was very little Christmas razzle at all, just Bourbon Street after a dinner of mac and cheese pizza with assorted friends.  Gael Garcia Bernal is so strange and beautiful in this film that I kept watching.  Suddenly it ended and Kate Hudsonwell, I don't want to ruin the ending for anyone, but to my surprise I found myself SOBBING HYSTERICALLY.  Very cathartic.  I nearly gave this movie five stars.",1387324800,,695,4.798319327731092
4456192,5,B004QWSU46,"Kate Hudson is her Mom's girl!  Both so radiant, filled with joy as well as beauty!  I keep thinking how Goldie must feel when she sees her daughter on screen in such a role!

This script is very predictable but the cast  makes it just wonderful.  I usually hate terminal-illness stories, especially involving cancer and I think that if I'd known that this was going to be one of them I wouldn't have watched it.  But Kate is so wonderful, both in her outrageous joyfulness as well as her huge heartfulness...that I loved every minute.

Gael Garcia Bernal seems like a funny choice for her leading man but it works perfectly.  They are both about the same size and both have a sweetness and innocence that is touching.  The supporting cast is equally great.  Characters that are almost cliches come to life here and are very believable.  Kathy Bates who is sometimes reduced to playing a cartoon is very real here.  Likewise those who played the Kooky Best Girlfriend, the Gay Black Best Buddy and even a terrific bit by a dwarf actor.  Perhaps it was the director who brought out the best in all of them.  It could have been a saccharine mess in lesser hands.

I highly recommend this to viewers of all ages and types.  There's something for everyone here.  Bring Kleenex!",1382140800,,1273,4.586666666666667

While following a formula can be okay for sheer entertainment, a movie about dying should do more to garner sympathy for the main character. Instead, Marley is so crude and narcissistic you begin to believe she's getting what she deserves. Frankly, watching a character approach middle age, still behaving as a teenager toward her peers and parents - whatever their faults, makes me shake my head in despair.

Most of the acting is vapid, all the writing insipid, and I felt a little sorry that Kathy Bates is so type-cast into the misunderstood-mother-in-crisis.  She deserves more.  Gael Garcia Bernal is the [highly unlikely] love interest, and probably did the best he could with what he had.  He had the good sense to appear humiliated throughout.

Is Kate Hudson still trying to coast on her mother's success?  She shouldn't need to do that, but she will need to cultivate her mother's intuition for a good script.  Meaningful stardom should not be an inherited trait.",1366329600,4,1097,4.956284153005464

4456216,4,B004QWSU46,"Sometimes you just need a movie that you know will provide a big ol' weepfest.

This is by far Kate Hudson's best acting performance.  It is, of course, a role served up to her on a platter - the kooky, beautiful, commitment phobic, dying young woman - but she excels, absolutely lighting up the screen in every scene.  She inhabits the character of Marley so thoroughly, the viewer almost believes it could really happen this way.  However, the plot contains a major flaw.

How does this very serious doctor who has no life suddenly determine that it is OK to have a personal relationship with a patient?  And what happens to all his other patients, now that he is seemingly spending most of his time with Marley?  In the real world, Julian's actions would constitute a serious breach of ethics.  In the movie world, it is addressed by a single line of dialogue (which is subsequently disregarded).  Granted, Marley's personal magnetism is considerable and the time left to spend with her is limited.  However, Julian mentioned that he felt indebted to others for getting the job, and he basically lived at the hospital.  The dramatic tension between his personal and professional obligations is completely missing and creates a huge void.

Then again, this is Movieland, and all of the actors are utterly charming.  I love certain movies in spite of their flaws, usually because the performances are especially compelling and/or the dialogue is well above average.  I watch those movies over and over, and eventually the flaws kind of disappear.  I have a feeling this is going to be one of those movies for me.  It has actually filled a void in my library - the guaranteed tearjerker that is somehow not depressing.  Skeptics could have a field day with this one, but to me it's bulletproof.",1361491200,3,1794,4.791530944625407

Wow... be prepared to cry again and again.  As you might expect in a movie about a dying young woman, this is a very emotional movie. But there always seems to be good right along with the tears.  This movie takes you through pretty much every emotion multiple times as this happy life-loving young woman makes the best out of her situation -- has good friends, fun when she can, works out relationships with her parents, finds love and allows herself to have it for once.

The hardest part about dying isn't the dying - it's all the goodbyes. ...But the harder the goodbyes, the more likely you have lived a good life.

Personally, I prefer to avoid movies that are going to put me through the emotional roller-coaster, but once in awhile one comes along that makes you feel glad you put yourself through it. Kind of an emotional growing experience.

Kate Hudson is a good solid actress but this movie did nothing for her career. It unfortunately ends like ""Love Story"" but the script doesn't help what otherwise would be good actors portraying genuine characters. The young Doctor introduces himself and we have to be told that he is Mexican-Jewish which is ridiculous and totally irrelevant. Do real people introduce themselves with the qualification that they are Catholic-Canadian or Danish-Lutheran, American-Baptist, etc. immediately after giving their name? Like ""Hello, I'm Dr. Smith. I'm German-American Episcopalian. It would be refreshing to watch a movie without having to know what religion the people are since, for the most part, its irrelevant to the story. I give this movie one star for cinematography, set design, sound quality, etc.  A love story? No way.  The relationship is superficial at best and Mr. Bernal as the doctor doesn't make it work nor is he at all believable. The movie starts with wild kisses and hugs but its for her African-American neighbor who just happens to be gay. This movie leaves one wondering if all of America is mostly homosexual and all doctors are Jewish. Good grief give the non-Jewish and non-homosexual community a decent break and try to mix the characters up just a bit to represent something close to what America currently is and what it is all about.

Very disappointed in Kate Hudson for agreeing to take such a role.  No matter how talented of an actress, the movie could not be redeemed, because of it's characters, story line, and gutter talk. This movie should have been R-rated for theme, crude/foul language, and skin.  It's no fun to watch movies that are from the gutter and bottom of the barrel.  I would love to see a producer with values produce a movie with values.  How about some Colonial America movies on the order of ""Hawkeye,"" Christy, and ""Little Women or the gozillion other Louisa May Alcott books.""  Please create more clean period pieces and more clean musicals--remember Seven Brides for Seven Brothers & My Fair Lady.  How about clean comedies--such as a ""Beverly Hillbillies"" movie, PG action/war/science fiction movies, and G or PG romance movies.  There's a lot of really good books out there to make into a movie, so why waste time with the garbage.  I'd give this movie a zero star rating if that were possible. This trashy  movie reaffirmed a vow that I will never rent/watch a PG-13 movie again.  If fact, I'm going back to reading for entertainment, unless Hollywood starts giving us movies that are worth watching!

Update:  Hollywood listened--really enjoyed Michael Landon Jr's ""When Calls the Heart,"" and Michael Damian's ""A Princess For Christmas.""

A Little Bit of Heaven may seem fluffy and weepy but I think it's one of the most rewarding films I've seen in many years.

4456296,5,B004QWSU46,"Outstanding movie! Extremely predictable but VERY realistic.

Shows the sad status of our society and medical establishment. This is every day life around us.

Divorced parents, hates her dad. Gets cancer. Doctors give her poison to ""treat"" the tumor.

The so called specialist (oncologist) only knows poison (...chemo) to treat cancer, or more lethal poison (clinical trial that makes you really sick).

She is full of contradictions. While a vegetarian, when her mom asks her if she thought about finding another doctor that uses nutrition and non-toxic treatments she laughs at her (...""I don't want any of the healy feel thing mom""). This is the idea the average person has about alternative treatments. Because the important guy with the white coat that knows everything (...i.e. oncologists) told her that only chemo will save her life. However, she is a very smart college educated advertising executive. But she wouldn't try anything else. Not even out of curiosity (...at this point what does she has to lose? She is dying anyway) because when she was in college she probably avoided all science classes. There are so many NON-TOXIC treatments out there that REALLY WORK. Get informed people!

Selfish family entourage (except her mom). Her sister doesn't want to get involved because she is pregnant and her dad (who probably divorced her mom when she was in grade school) is busy traveling even when she is terminal (...call me if you need anything)

Great acting. Kate Hudson and Kathy Bates are FANTASTIC. The two doctors are really well portrayed in their ignorance and focus on chemotherapy. The only problem is Whoopi Goldberg. She is not really believable and she doesn't look comfortable in her role. Bad choice. I guess all other several hundreds actors that could play the same role in more credible way were not available.

Great movie, everybody needs to see it. Like looking in the mirror.

4456308,4,B004QWSU46,"This movie caught me quite by surprise.  I was thoroughly delighted with the acting of Kate Hudson (Marley Corbett) while looking for her to pull out her acting chops once again as I have seen her do before. In her engrossing portrayal of Penny Lane in Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical account 'Almost Famous', Hudson shines as the brightest and most promising new star on the horizon. In this movie, she also is able to deliver on several levels and in diverse genres.  She is not pigeonholed into being just a comedic actress.  While there is the element of comedy also present, Hudson also pulls the tears and much drama.

Set in New Orleans, Marley is on top as an advertising executive and at the pinnacle of her career succeeding on her own terms.  She is fulfilled through her high power status enjoying many gratifying friendships and is completely lovable as her story unfolds and develops.

Marley's most relevant friendship is with the wonderful Rosemarie DeWitt (Renee). Kathy Bates and Treat Williams portray her divorced parents.  First completely self-absorbed, emotionally vacant and severely critical of Marley.  One could easily respect her apprehension toward committed relationships with her bickering mother and father. As Beverly and Jack, they give a wonderful turn in their spot-on roles of her parents.

Marley begins to notice herself feeling drained, fatigued and being told she is losing weight.  At her friends urging she visits Dr. Julian Goldstein, the superlative actor Gael Garcia Bernal in a different role for him. I enjoyed Bernal in this movie. He is charming through the dichotomy of feelings he starts having for Marley and is quite shy owning a sweet uncomfortable nature. After he relinquishes his position as her doctor, the two visit a jazz club in the French Quarter. Here we are treated to the music of local musician Ivan Neville (of the 'Neville Brothers') and his band.  The two begin talking more while singer Macy Gray lends a lovely background song as the two inevitably fall in love.

Marley finally begins to resolve massive relationship issues with her parents and going forward to start relating to them as their daughter.  Co-workers and her very important friends need attending to also, the priority being the emotionally distraught Renee. The two actresses share an intense scene at Renee's home that may draw tears as DeWitt punches it home.

There is an underlying subplot with this. For me, the movie would be better served by excluding it and taking it as the relationship driven movie it intends to be.  It is a solid piece with or without it.  The movie is a great view either way you see it while Hudson works through her little bit of heaven.",1336694400,11,2714,4.9449339207048455

Finding her own truth about her family and friends, and coming to peace with all around her is stellar.
Thank you for making this film available early.  It was a great way to spend my Saturday evening.  The relativly new actor Gael is a breath of fresh air.

She is afraid of commitment, perhaps reflecting her experience with her parents Beverly Corbett (Kathy Bates) and  Jack Corbett (Treat Williams)  - a couple who seem perennially at odds with each other and the world and maintain a distance form Marley.  Marley has solid friendships: Sarah (Lucy Punch) tries to learn feminine wiles techniques from Marley, Renee (Rosemarie DeWitt) has Marley babysit her delightful child Cammie while she tends to mothering and wifeing with her husband (Jason Davis - she is again pregnant), her boss  Rob (Steven Weber) and her gay next door neighbor Peter Cooper (Romany Malco).  Marley sleeps with lots of attractive guys but when they begin to talk about longterm relationships, Marley backs off.

At the advertising agency Marley is asked if she is losing weight, a question that drives Marley to the doctor.  Her new physician is Dr. Julian Goldstein (Gael Garca Bernal), a handsome but shy and dedicated young man who examines Marley and sedates her for colonoscopy: while Marley is under medication she dreams of being in heaven next to God (Whoopi Goldberg) who tells her she is dying and gives her three wishes - Marley chooses a million dollars, a chance to fly, and to find love. Upon awakening she is informed she has extensive colon cancer and Dr. Goldstein suggests she see a Dr. Sanders (Alan Dale) who offers her two choices - extensive chemotherapy or death.  Marley chooses the former and from there she begins to alter her relationships with everyone around her. She gradually falls in love with Dr. Goldstein, confronts her parents and friends with her news, and the manner in which they accept her fate is where the film alters to a tender heart-warming gentle string of events that should be seen instead of read.

It is so rewarding to see Kate Hudson expand her acting talent into a serious role and she manages to find that perfect balance between the lighthearted personality we all recognize and the empathetic and vulnerable woman she becomes. Gael Garca Bernal assumes a new type of role and is completely charming and loveable.  There is a fine cameo by Peter Dinklage - a Special Escort hired by neighbor Peter to give Marley `a little bit of heaven' - and Kathy Bates, Lucy Punch, and Romany Malco are particularly fine.  This film will likely bring a few tears to the viewer's eyes, but those releases of emotion just make us feel better about life.  Despite the few over the edge silly parts in the film this is a solid little gem that should find an appreciative audience when it reaches the theaters.

He was all about life and while I usually stay away from these movies due to the slow, agonizing-for-me loss of brother and later a best friend, I'm glad I watched this one. It may seem formulaic and overly scripted but I know at least two who went out living with heart until the very end. So cliche but I gotta say it, Art imitates ... end of life.",1515110400,,490,4.223404255319149

8438573,1,B004QWSU46,"This movie was beyond terrible. It was like they took every obnoxious clich they could think of, read a few hallmark cards, and then tried to go down a disingenuous diversity checklist to try to pull the terrible acting together. Kate Hudson plays a rich white girl who is very egocentric and tries to be cool by talking about sex all the time, yet simultaneously treats everyone around her poorly and selfishly. None of the interactions seem genuine. And of course they throw in the annoying stereotype of a doctor who falls in love with his patient: his selfish, b***hy patient.  Terrible script, followed by terrible acting by most of them. Its kind of like she was still trying to play her Penny Lane role in a movie where it totally didn't fit. Gael Garca Bernal was a good choice, and helped make the movie a bit more bearable. However, they also waved him around like diversity flag and gave him a stupid role: lets make him speak English poorly, be socially awkward and inept, and make a completely irrelevant statement when we first meet him that labels him as a Mexican-Jewish immigrant, yet never expanding on that to make it even slightly relevant to the rest of the story. They just go right back to rich, white girl and her rich, white daddy issues. It was cheesy, but not even pleasantly cheesy: it was just annoying and lacking any real creativity. Overall, I wouldnt recommend wasting your time on this movie...",1512518400,,1428,4.666666666666667
