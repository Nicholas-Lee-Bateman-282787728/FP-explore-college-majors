8200476,2,B000RG17UY,"First let me say that my copy while the photography was good, the sound track skipped and I can not understand a single word. It is not broken English but the audio portion of the DVD. There was no quality control on this - sad to say. Throughout the entire DVD, I can not make out a single word. Now, while Grand Master Park is awesome in his technique, his assistants seem to be lacking even though they are black belts. I felt like I was in a class as he had to correct the assistants in stretching and in some of the kicks. As he demonstrated combination kicks, his speed and power were very impressive - but when the assistant did the same move, it lacked technique. Just looked like a class.",1414195200,3,697,4.2481203007518795
